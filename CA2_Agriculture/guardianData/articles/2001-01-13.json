      "body": "<p>For all skiers, from beginners to World Cup racers, falling is part of the game. Most falls cause no injuries other than a few bruises, and wipe-outs can often be a source of much amusement to your friends. However, to help tip the odds in your favour, here are a few pointers. </p> <p>The most important rule is: if you're going to crash, let it happen. If you're sitting way back on the tails of your skis, don't fight it. It's probably safer just to flop on to your side and skid to a halt. When your knees are bent to the extreme of their range of movement, they are weak and vulnerable. While you're trying to recover from this position, any unexpected twisting movement could easily cause a rupture of your anterior-cruciate ligament - the most common injury in skiing. </p> <p>When you feel yourself falling sideways, never put your hand down to break your fall. The only thing you may break will be a thumb, especially on dry ski slopes. Just let yourself fall to the side, and let your rump bear the brunt of the impact. That way, the worst injury you'll suffer will be a juicy bruise. </p> <p>You can learn a lot about \"falling technique\" from watching World Cup racers on TV. You'll often see that, once they've crashed, they try to end up sliding on their back, with their feet in the air, especially if one or both skis are still attached. This prevents any damage being done by their skis catching in the snow and twisting their legs. And because they keep their legs straight, their knees are stronger and more resistant to twisting forces. </p> <p>If you're skidding along the ground at speed, try to think quickly, regain your bearings, and pay particular attention to any solid obstacles (trees, pylons, rocky outcrops) in your path. If so, you must try to manoeuvre yourself around so that you take the impact feet first rather than headfirst - leg injuries are seldom as serious as head injuries. In any case, trying to skid feet first is always a good habit, because it means you can dig the edges of your skis (or ski) into the snow to slow yourself down. </p> <p>It may happen that you find yourself hurtling down a steep slope with neither ski attached. In that case, you need to perform the so-called \"self-arrest procedure\". Try to spin so you're skidding along on your stomach, with your feet facing down the hill. Then, slowly perform a press-up. As your shoulders rise, your toes will dig into the snow and slow you down. </p> <p>After the fall, you'll have to get up again, hopefully fairly speedily, so as not to keep your friends waiting. Before trying to stand up, make sure your skis are facing exactly across the slope. Otherwise, they'll start to set off before you're fully upright. Then, you can usually push yourself up using your ski poles, by putting them together in the snow above you. Place your downhill hand on top of the poles, and hold the base of the poles with your uphill hand. You should now be able to pull yourself upright. </p> <p>If you're unlucky enough to have fallen in deep powder, you may find that your poles sink deep into the snow whenever you try to push yourself up on them. The solution is to place your poles flat on the snow, in a crossed \"X\" shape. You should then be able to lean on the intersection of the two poles without sinking in, as the pressure will be more widely distributed. </p> <p>Of course, your skis may no longer be attached. If one is still on, spin around on your back until you're lying sideways on the slope, with your ski across the slope below you, attached to your downhill foot. This means that once you've stood up, you'll be putting on your uphill ski, which is always easier. If both your skis have come off, put on the uphill ski first, then spin around through 180 degrees, pivoting on your ski-less boot. Now, when you're putting on the second ski, it will also be the uphill ski. </p> <p>A perennial problem, when putting your skis back on, is removing snow from the soles of your boots. This is necessary, otherwise your safety bindings may not function correctly. Many people like to knock the snow off with a ski pole, but the most efficient way is to scrape the sole of your boot along the toe piece of your binding. </p> <p>In deep snow, you might find it easier to stick the tails of both skis in the snow, at an angle, before putting them on. If you push them into the snow so that the heel pieces of the bindings are just above the surface of the snow, it'll be easy to click into the bindings without them becoming filled with snow.</p> <p>\u0095 Next week: Manoeuvring around the mountain.

      "body": "<p>Centuries ago, when I was a teenager, Calais was my Thailand. Or rather, it was my Bangkok airport, a place where I'd arrive with backpack and head off into the wide blue foreign yonder, a world of self-discovery, fags, booze and unpoliced snogging. </p> <p>Of Calais itself I knew nothing except for its dowdy ferry terminal and hideously cratered surrounding landscape of cranes and dirt heaps. Until recently, that has been how most people regarded it - a dump that had to be arrived at in order to leave for somewhere more beauteous and interesting. </p> <p>The outskirts of Calais are cash-and-carry heaven, its pearly gates the ineffable Cit\u00e9 d'Europe, a shopping mall so charmless and anodyne it makes Bluewater look like the Brompton Road. But even after the building of the tunnel, the centre of Calais remained an unknown zone to most of the eight million Brits who annually head there. </p> <p>But early last summer, thanks to a near-miraculous feat by its football club, Calais finally found its place in the sun. When its amateur squad of cash-and-carry shelf stackers, swimming pool attendants, teachers and students played First Division Nantes in the final of the Coupe de France - the French FA Cup - it was as if Hartlepool had battled through to meet Manchester United at Wembley. </p> <p>Calais lost, but only to a last-minute penalty, and thanks to its Cup run, the club has paid off all its debts and, through generous win bonuses kept the squad together. Still managed by the thrillingly tempestuous Spaniard Ladislas Lozano, they are top of their league and are attempting to recreate last season's cup run, starting with First Division side Sedan, who provide the opposition next Saturday. </p> <p>In other words, there is now a reason to visit Calais that doesn't come in cases of 12 or disappear back to Eng land for resale from the back of a hired van. After all, if you're a Londoner, what makes more sense: follow relegated Wimbledon on this season's pilgrimage of four-hour train journeys to Barnsley and Crewe, or go for the alternative - a brisk Channel hop to become an honorary Calaisien? Why afflict your intestines with the half-time pies of Bolton and Preston when you can enjoy a Stade Julien Denis baguette stuffed with jambon and a side order of very decent frites ? </p> <p>This season, games kick off at 6pm French time. With a bit of forward planning, you can take an early ferry or go by Eurotunnel, pack in a day's shopping, watch a game, have a meal then catch the last ferry or train home. </p> <p>Calais's 80-year-old stadium has been given a new coat of paint together with a new set of speakers. Calaisiens liken the place to a cemetery when empty, but when it is packed it's very cheerful, very old-style anglais - one modest stand and the other three sides made up of terracing. You can't take alcohol into the stadium, but wine and beer is on sale inside. You've got Mexican waves and cheerleaders with pom-pons (in the club colours of le sang et l'or). Playing in the Championnat Amateur means that Calais not only compete against other north-eastern clubs but also the reserve teams of some of the big boys, too, so it is quite possible you will be watching future internationals, or established stars enduring a temporary spell in the stiffs. </p> <p>What's more, the town itself is lovely place if you just stop and look. Think Dover, but with better grub, shinier sun and flower-decked streets. It has ramparts and citadels, cobbles and quays, roundabouts with little boats stuck in the middle, gardens full of sunflowers the size of long-playing records, street painting exhibitions (the most popular themes are boats, flowers and, naturally, footballers). </p> <p>The town's unsung attraction is its beach, which is wide and beautiful. It's clean, too - dogs are banned from March to October. The harbour end features a palatial toilettes which looks like a mausoleum designed by Bauhaus and would be a definite candidate for listed status on the other side of the Channel. </p> <p>All along the seafront are rows of white-painted beach huts behind which are rows of restaurants with terraces to sit out at as you work your way through a bowl of moules roquefort, swill gamay and watch the non-stop ferry action. You won't find that at Selhurst Park. </p> <p> <strong> Le Foot </strong></p> <p> Calais Racing Union Football Club, Stade Julien Denis, Avenue St Exupery. 62100 Calais. Ticket prices - main stand (seated) Fr50, terrace (standing) Fr40, populaire (standing around the side) Fr20. The club doesn't yet take credit-card bookings, but if you dust off your French and telephone them, they'll leave tickets for you to pick up on the day. </p> <p> <strong> Getting there</strong> </p> <p> Tickets on <a href=\"http://www.posl.com\">P&amp;O Stena Line</a> services from Dover (0870 6000600) cost from \u00a362 return for a car and five passengers, and \u00a315 return for foot passengers. <a href=\"http://www.eurotunnel.com\">Eurotunnel</a> (0870 5353535) is currently offering an overnight ticket for a car and up to eight passengers for \u00a369 return. </p> <p>The Stade Julien Denis is on the east of the town. On the way, call in at the club shop (162 Bld de la Fraternit\u00e9), somewhat disconcertingly billeted in a concern called Copy Magic. </p> <p>Don't even think about trying to park in the ground (the forecourt is so small even the seagulls have to fight for room). Plenty of spaces can be found within strolling distance. If you're making the trip on foot, a taxi from the ferry terminal will cost around Fr50, bus Fr10. </p> <p> <strong> Where to shop</strong> </p> <p> The Saturday morning market based in <strong> Place d'Armes</strong> has lovely flower arrangements, a fair amount of tat and a great selection of fruit and veg: mirabelles, muscat grapes, fresh flageolet beans, celeriac the size of elephants' feet. </p> <p>Heading west will bring you to <strong> Commercial Centre Auchan</strong> (motorway Junction 12 or 14) where as well as the Auchan hypermarket you will find <strong> Sainsbury's</strong>; a plus is that in the event of a bottle turning out corked you can return it to your local store back home. The site also includes a <strong> Nike</strong> factory outlet (savings of up to \u00a330 on trainers). </p> <p>Junction 18 will lead you to <strong> East Enders</strong>, Dave West's cavernous cash-and-carry where you can pick up an astonishingly drinkable white plonk called The Dog's Bollocks for \u00a31 a bottle or an excellent gigondas. </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat</strong> </p> <p> Around the beach area, you're spoilt for choice, from terrace caf\u00e9s to big seafront restaurants. The best of the brasseries is <strong> La Mer</strong> (3 21 96 17 72) specialising in plateaux de fruit de mer and moules. <strong> Aquar'aile</strong> (3 21 34 00 00) perched on a hilltop overlooking the ocean, lets you scoff elegantly (the speciality is foie gras) while enjoying the sun going down over the sea. </p> <p>If you've brought the car, head out of town to the little bucket-and-spade resort of Wimereux and the beach-side Hotel Atlantique. It is now the home of <strong> La Liegoise</strong> (3 21 32 41 01), which used to be in the centre of Boulogne and was the eaterie of choice for most locals. There's a great wine shop in Wimereux, too - <strong> Mille Vignes</strong>, run by Englishman Nick Sweet, 90-94 Rue Carnot (3 21 32 60 13). </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay</strong> </p> <p> Plenty of choice in the town itself. The <strong> Metropol</strong> (3 21 97 54 00), is a classic old-fashioned French hotel, close to the station but peacefully overlooking one of the quays.

      "bodyText": "Centuries ago, when I was a teenager, Calais was my Thailand. Or rather, it was my Bangkok airport, a place where I'd arrive with backpack and head off into the wide blue foreign yonder, a world of self-discovery, fags, booze and unpoliced snogging. Of Calais itself I knew nothing except for its dowdy ferry terminal and hideously cratered surrounding landscape of cranes and dirt heaps. Until recently, that has been how most people regarded it - a dump that had to be arrived at in order to leave for somewhere more beauteous and interesting. The outskirts of Calais are cash-and-carry heaven, its pearly gates the ineffable Cit\u00e9 d'Europe, a shopping mall so charmless and anodyne it makes Bluewater look like the Brompton Road. But even after the building of the tunnel, the centre of Calais remained an unknown zone to most of the eight million Brits who annually head there. But early last summer, thanks to a near-miraculous feat by its football club, Calais finally found its place in the sun. When its amateur squad of cash-and-carry shelf stackers, swimming pool attendants, teachers and students played First Division Nantes in the final of the Coupe de France - the French FA Cup - it was as if Hartlepool had battled through to meet Manchester United at Wembley. Calais lost, but only to a last-minute penalty, and thanks to its Cup run, the club has paid off all its debts and, through generous win bonuses kept the squad together. Still managed by the thrillingly tempestuous Spaniard Ladislas Lozano, they are top of their league and are attempting to recreate last season's cup run, starting with First Division side Sedan, who provide the opposition next Saturday. In other words, there is now a reason to visit Calais that doesn't come in cases of 12 or disappear back to Eng land for resale from the back of a hired van. After all, if you're a Londoner, what makes more sense: follow relegated Wimbledon on this season's pilgrimage of four-hour train journeys to Barnsley and Crewe, or go for the alternative - a brisk Channel hop to become an honorary Calaisien? Why afflict your intestines with the half-time pies of Bolton and Preston when you can enjoy a Stade Julien Denis baguette stuffed with jambon and a side order of very decent frites ? This season, games kick off at 6pm French time. With a bit of forward planning, you can take an early ferry or go by Eurotunnel, pack in a day's shopping, watch a game, have a meal then catch the last ferry or train home. Calais's 80-year-old stadium has been given a new coat of paint together with a new set of speakers. Calaisiens liken the place to a cemetery when empty, but when it is packed it's very cheerful, very old-style anglais - one modest stand and the other three sides made up of terracing. You can't take alcohol into the stadium, but wine and beer is on sale inside. You've got Mexican waves and cheerleaders with pom-pons (in the club colours of le sang et l'or). Playing in the Championnat Amateur means that Calais not only compete against other north-eastern clubs but also the reserve teams of some of the big boys, too, so it is quite possible you will be watching future internationals, or established stars enduring a temporary spell in the stiffs. What's more, the town itself is lovely place if you just stop and look. Think Dover, but with better grub, shinier sun and flower-decked streets. It has ramparts and citadels, cobbles and quays, roundabouts with little boats stuck in the middle, gardens full of sunflowers the size of long-playing records, street painting exhibitions (the most popular themes are boats, flowers and, naturally, footballers). The town's unsung attraction is its beach, which is wide and beautiful. It's clean, too - dogs are banned from March to October. The harbour end features a palatial toilettes which looks like a mausoleum designed by Bauhaus and would be a definite candidate for listed status on the other side of the Channel. All along the seafront are rows of white-painted beach huts behind which are rows of restaurants with terraces to sit out at as you work your way through a bowl of moules roquefort, swill gamay and watch the non-stop ferry action. You won't find that at Selhurst Park. Le Foot Calais Racing Union Football Club, Stade Julien Denis, Avenue St Exupery. 62100 Calais. Ticket prices - main stand (seated) Fr50, terrace (standing) Fr40, populaire (standing around the side) Fr20. The club doesn't yet take credit-card bookings, but if you dust off your French and telephone them, they'll leave tickets for you to pick up on the day. Getting there Tickets on P&amp;O Stena Line services from Dover (0870 6000600) cost from \u00a362 return for a car and five passengers, and \u00a315 return for foot passengers. Eurotunnel (0870 5353535) is currently offering an overnight ticket for a car and up to eight passengers for \u00a369 return. The Stade Julien Denis is on the east of the town. On the way, call in at the club shop (162 Bld de la Fraternit\u00e9), somewhat disconcertingly billeted in a concern called Copy Magic. Don't even think about trying to park in the ground (the forecourt is so small even the seagulls have to fight for room). Plenty of spaces can be found within strolling distance. If you're making the trip on foot, a taxi from the ferry terminal will cost around Fr50, bus Fr10. Where to shop The Saturday morning market based in Place d'Armes has lovely flower arrangements, a fair amount of tat and a great selection of fruit and veg: mirabelles, muscat grapes, fresh flageolet beans, celeriac the size of elephants' feet. Heading west will bring you to Commercial Centre Auchan (motorway Junction 12 or 14) where as well as the Auchan hypermarket you will find Sainsbury's; a plus is that in the event of a bottle turning out corked you can return it to your local store back home. The site also includes a Nike factory outlet (savings of up to \u00a330 on trainers). Junction 18 will lead you to East Enders, Dave West's cavernous cash-and-carry where you can pick up an astonishingly drinkable white plonk called The Dog's Bollocks for \u00a31 a bottle or an excellent gigondas. Where to eat Around the beach area, you're spoilt for choice, from terrace caf\u00e9s to big seafront restaurants. The best of the brasseries is La Mer (3 21 96 17 72) specialising in plateaux de fruit de mer and moules. Aquar'aile (3 21 34 00 00) perched on a hilltop overlooking the ocean, lets you scoff elegantly (the speciality is foie gras) while enjoying the sun going down over the sea. If you've brought the car, head out of town to the little bucket-and-spade resort of Wimereux and the beach-side Hotel Atlantique. It is now the home of La Liegoise (3 21 32 41 01), which used to be in the centre of Boulogne and was the eaterie of choice for most locals. There's a great wine shop in Wimereux, too - Mille Vignes, run by Englishman Nick Sweet, 90-94 Rue Carnot (3 21 32 60 13). Where to stay Plenty of choice in the town itself. The Metropol (3 21 97 54 00), is a classic old-fashioned French hotel, close to the station but peacefully overlooking one of the quays. It has three stars, very reasonable rates and a cosy bar. Even more central is the George V (3 21 97 68 00) in Rue Royale, swanky without being overbearing and with a portrait of the Queen in the foyer. For those who crave proximity to the shopping, there's a B&amp;B and an F1 at the Auchan centre. What to see Head down Rue Royale (stopping at the Patisserie aux 6 Bourgeois de Calais to stock up on chocolate sardines, poire chocolat gateau and frangipane cassis) to the very good Office de Tourisme (12 Boulevard Clemenceau, 3 21 96 62 40) where you can overload yourself with all the leaflets you desire about the area's attractions. Within the town itself are two museums (covering the diverse subjects of lace and war) and a boat tour round the Citadelle. A tour of Calais lighthouse, where you can also hire a bike (Fr80 per day), will set you back Fr14. The town has well-marked paths and the canal towpaths to Coulogne and Guines make for peaceful, traffic-free cycling.",

      "body": "<p>The summer, with its warmth and blue skies, is of limited interest to the photographer Don McCullin. He prefers the harsh drama of a wet winter landscape, with naked trees against a metallic sky as the light drains from a grim afternoon in December or January. </p> <p>The handful of landscape photographs he takes each year are done in the winter months, and he has been accused of making them look like war scenes, full of a sense of threat - like his most famous photojournalism shot in conflicts from Vietnam to Afghanistan. </p> <p>McCullin says he always looks for drama and a sense of conflict with the elements, and he usually finds it in the Somerset Levels, the huge area of drained marshland inland from the town of Bridgwater. \"This is the time of year I go down to the Levels. I go to see the skies and make a marriage of the skies and the flooded land,\" he says. \"I go in a very solitary, humble way: I just get my wellingtons on and splash through the meadows with my camera and tripod. </p> <p>\"You see these naked trees standing in flooded fields, and there's no question about it, it's awe-inspiring. I go very much as an explorer, hoping to have a confrontation with the elements. I don't want a landscape like the cover of a chocolate box - I want it angry, wild, flooded and naked.\" </p> <p>McCullin has always been a walker, often while working: \"I've walked over the mountains of New Guinea and across Afghanistan for 150 miles when my feet have been bleeding and Russian MiGs have been diving on me and I've been hiding under mulberry bushes, bedding down with camels at night. </p> <p>\"I'm still a good walker at 65, and my mind walks as much as my body. It's totally therapeutic and free, and when I come back I find I'm healed from things that have confused or upset me.\" </p> <p>He says his visits to the Levels are never planned or methodical, so he finds it hard to describe a definite route. But he will often go to the vantage point of Glastonbury, with its famous Tor and New Age atmosphere, before striking out into the Levels. \"I walk through the fields and meadows, looking for the unexpected,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I remember once waiting there to see the sun go down, when I heard this splashing noise behind me, and it was an otter moving down a dyke with an eel in its mouth. Things like that happen when you're doing photography - another time, I was standing still in a forest when a fox came past within 15ft of me. </p> <p>\"In the Levels, I'm trying to get a mood of mystery, mythology and spiritual energy. Quite honestly, I could photograph the area between now and when I leave this earth and I'd still not do it justice. Sometimes when I see the drama of the winter skies, I think of things like Wagner, I think of the old Arthurian legends, and these things encourage me to stick it out and stay there when the rain is peeing on me, my hands are freezing cold and I can hardly load my film. </p> <p>\"That's when I'm at my happiest: it's like an anointment of joy for me to have everything going in ways which other people might think horribly ugly and bad. I like looking at the drama of it all. And it's really great when you come home and get in a hot bath and make yourself a cup of tea - that's what being an Englishman's all about, isn't it? It's called masochism.\"</p> <p><strong>A level playing field</strong></p> <p>The Somerset Levels, divided into northern and southern sections by the 500ft ridge of the Polden Hills, were entirely flooded until Roman times. According to local legend, Joseph of Arimathea and his nephew Jesus sailed up to Glastonbury, at the eastern end of the Levels, where they planted the Holy Thorn. </p> <p>Serious drainage began in the Middle Ages and was completed during the agricultural-improvement drive of recent centuries. Now, there are plans to raise the water levels again to foster birdlife and distinctive wetland plants.</p> <p>The flat, narrow roads of the Levels are ideal for cycling, and Somerset County Council has produced leaflets on four recommended circuits.

      "body": "<p>I was whistling Je Ne Regrette Rien. My seven-year-old daughter was singing Fr\u00e8re Jacques rather too loudly. My boyfriend was silent, presumably remembering many a steamy film set in such blissful scenery. We were driving through the gentle French countryside in a soft-top classic Citro\u00ebn 2CV, of indeterminate years. Like all women of a certain age, she had disguised her date of manufacture even from her owners. The most they could say was \"over 20 years old\", which I think was very gallant, as she was probably pushing 30 at least. </p> <p>I ought to explain that none of my family is a car enthusiast, and neither myself, my boyfriend, nor my daughter for that matter, had driven or even sat in a 2CV before. But although we weren't interested in classic cars, we were interested in what promised to be a classic experience - spending a long weekend driving around the heart of south-west France in a piece of French history. I imagined myself as some old movie star, scarf about my head, dark sunglasses with wings, and a ruthlessly-waisted flowered frock billowing in the breeze. </p> <p>A 2CV and the rolling cognac vineyards of Charente were as meant for each other as Parmesan and pasta. Or, as Monsieur Richon, our host at La Templerie, the 17th-century gte where we stayed, put it: \"Le Camembert, le beret, et le Deux Chevaux!\" </p> <p>Monsieur was very droll. \"Campagne,\" was all he said, opening the wooden shutters on to a postcard of green hills lined with his very own 20 hectacres of vines. \"Breakfast time?\" I asked. He replied languidly, \"Whenever you want.\" </p> <p>The other guests, all French, with whom we shared croissant and unsalted butter around La Templerie's breakfast table, had many a story from their youth to tell about 2CVs. One plump woman from Paris informed us that you could take out the seats and have a picnic sitting in them. An engineer from the Channel Tunnel announced with authority, \"The Deux Chevaux is not a French car, it's a French legend,\" and recommended a number of books to read on its history and cultural significances. Madame Richon gave me a bit of advice. \"You have to love the car for having personality,\" she said. \"It is part of the experience. Part of the romance.\" </p> <p>The car's personality was soon apparent. On day one, the accelerator fell off. I picked it up from the floor of the car, holding on to the steering wheel with my other hand, and tried to slot it back on again. My seven-year-old offered to help. She would, as it happened, have been more qualified than I, having spent long afternoons making oddly shaped and very imaginative machines out of Meccano. Because 2CVs are like kit cars, you could practically build one yourself. In fact, some people do. </p> <p>Each morning began with a similar bang. \"Toute vitesse!\" cheered my boyfriend as we went up to 40km per hour at full throttle. \"Another adventure!\" cheered my seven-year-old. She wasn't referring to our picnic by the side of the green and murky Charente river, which curves so confusingly due north that you have to cross it several times; nor to the trip into the nearby market town of Angoul me to buy boxes of tiny wild strawberries; not even to the excursion to the Letuffe chocolate factory, where they let you taste the sweets and dip your finger into the melting pot. What excited her was our car. Travelling in a 2CV is a unique eye on the world. All your senses are filtered through the overpowering presence of your rattling, violently vibrating car. It soon becomes as addictive as it is exhausting. </p> <p>After a hard day behind the wheel, the Templerie beckoned as an oasis of stationary silence, and a place for a quick dip to wash off the dust. My daughter, struggling with her French pronunciation, called the swimming pool the \"piss-in\", which was probably pretty accurate given that the average age of those who swam in it was three. </p> <p>Monsieur Richon took us around his distillery where, in a Heath Robinson of brass pipes and huge wooden barrels on a dirt floor, he brews pineau, a fortified wine, from his own grapes. The sweet smell in the dark, dank room was overpowering. Monsieur removed the cork from the centre of one barrel to let us breathe in the intoxicating smell. His family had been manufacturing this pleasure, sitting in the same 17th-century outhouse and sticking the labels on bottles by hand using a big old-fashioned glue pot, for the past 250 years. </p> <p>On Wednesdays, he took a couple of crates of his bottles into Angoul me and sold them at the market. Pineau rouge was designed to be drunk as an aperitif or \"avec chocolat\"; pineau ros\u00e9 was to be taken with melon or the tiny berry-sized wild strawberries; but the cream of the crop, pineau blanc, was to be imbibed with the local speciality, foie gras. \"Big headache drink,\" said Monsieur, struggling with his English. A local farmer friend of the Richons visited one evening with his very own foie gras, as well as smoked duck slices and something that turned out to be roast neck of fowl. None of it looked very appetising, but together it did something to your sense of taste that is almost indescribable. The foods of Charente certainly stimulate your tongue - and widen your waistline. Thankfully, a couple of vibrating, rattling hours in our 2CV was as good as a workout. At least, when I rose each morning my limbs ached as if I'd had a major gym session the day before. </p> <p>It was hard to tear ourselves away from the hedonistic haven of La Templerie for another day of adventure - and ridicule. Naively south London, we thought we were classic travellers in France. The French thought we were a joke. Everywhere we went, we raised chuckles. Cheers of, \"Aha, les Anglais!\" went up as we arrived at a restaurant for our evening meal. \"You're the ones with the Deux Chevaux!\" You certainly could spot us a kilometre off. First, there was the noise. Even the tick of the indicator was as loud as a grandfather clock. \"It's surprising how sanguine you get about the accelerator falling off,\" said my boyfriend, holding it up in his hand again. Usually, we stalled to a stop. Then, shaken and stirred, we fell out (you don't get out of a 2CV). </p> <p>On the final day of our long weekend, our 2CV finally gave up. We sat on the verge of a country lane, waiting for the mechanicWe told him that the accelerator was self-removing. \"C'est normal,\" he said, shrugging his shoulders. We reported that the passenger door didn't open, which necessitated climbing over into the driver's seat to get out. \"C'est un Deux Chevaux,\" he said, as if we were mad to complain. We clambered into the back of the mechanic's car, and looked out of the back window at our 2CV, which was waiting to be rescued, an ageing damsel in distress. </p> <p>Back at the garage, the only car they could give us as a replacement was a classic Mini - \"over 20 years old\" was all they knew about her. She was also very handsome, with a walnut dashboard and an over-enthusiastic heater which wouldn't switch off, so she was rather like a mobile sauna. As we drove back up the gravel path of La Templerie, the Channel Tunnel engineer saw us and announced, \"Vous avez un auto Anglais.\" </p> <p>\"It's not an English car,\" I said, mustering all my national pride. \"It's an English legend.\"</p>",

A local farmer friend of the Richons visited one evening with his very own foie gras, as well as smoked duck slices and something that turned out to be roast neck of fowl. None of it looked very appetising, but together it did something to your sense of taste that is almost indescribable. The foods of Charente certainly stimulate your tongue - and widen your waistline. Thankfully, a couple of vibrating, rattling hours in our 2CV was as good as a workout. At least, when I rose each morning my limbs ached as if I'd had a major gym session the day before. It was hard to tear ourselves away from the hedonistic haven of La Templerie for another day of adventure - and ridicule. Naively south London, we thought we were classic travellers in France. The French thought we were a joke. Everywhere we went, we raised chuckles. Cheers of, \"Aha, les Anglais!\" went up as we arrived at a restaurant for our evening meal. \"You're the ones with the Deux Chevaux!\" You certainly could spot us a kilometre off. First, there was the noise. Even the tick of the indicator was as loud as a grandfather clock. \"It's surprising how sanguine you get about the accelerator falling off,\" said my boyfriend, holding it up in his hand again. Usually, we stalled to a stop. Then, shaken and stirred, we fell out (you don't get out of a 2CV). On the final day of our long weekend, our 2CV finally gave up. We sat on the verge of a country lane, waiting for the mechanicWe told him that the accelerator was self-removing. \"C'est normal,\" he said, shrugging his shoulders. We reported that the passenger door didn't open, which necessitated climbing over into the driver's seat to get out. \"C'est un Deux Chevaux,\" he said, as if we were mad to complain. We clambered into the back of the mechanic's car, and looked out of the back window at our 2CV, which was waiting to be rescued, an ageing damsel in distress. Back at the garage, the only car they could give us as a replacement was a classic Mini - \"over 20 years old\" was all they knew about her. She was also very handsome, with a walnut dashboard and an over-enthusiastic heater which wouldn't switch off, so she was rather like a mobile sauna. As we drove back up the gravel path of La Templerie, the Channel Tunnel engineer saw us and announced, \"Vous avez un auto Anglais.\" \"It's not an English car,\" I said, mustering all my national pride. \"It's an English legend.\"",

After a refreshing dinner (\u00a325 excluding wine), we decided in a fit of bravado to enter the stroke-play competition the following day only to find ourselves paired with the three-time club champion, a Swedish woman in her mid-50s. </p> <p>After a perfunctory introduction, during which she informed us that she used to play with Laura Davies, my father hooked his ball off the first tee into the small stream on the right, while I duffed my first shot short of the ladies' tee, the second went three yards, and the third went high and wide down the right.

      "body": "<p>Early morning is the best time on Var's St Clair beach. The beach boys are busy manicuring the ruffled sand outside their concessions with antique contraptions like cages on poles, which leave disciplined stripes like a lawnmower; then comes the hammering-in of the parasols and the laying-out of the mattresses. Take your pick from yellow at the far end of the long curving beach, then turquoise, blue, green and maroon. The big decision comes at lunchtime; shall it be moules at the maroon, or fruits de mer at the blue? </p> <p>St Tropez may be only 45km to the east, but it could be on another planet. The image of Riviera gloss and glitter has no relevance in this stretch of Var, whose intimate sandy beaches, divided by rocky outcrops and shaded by pines, are an abiding unsophisticated delight. </p> <p>An elderly Frenchman potters down into the water, trailing a thermometer on a string behind him. \"Vingt degr\u00e9s. Trop froid Madame,\" he pronounces. Not for me it's not. Not after the chilly English waters. I strike out into the bay directly into the path of the rising sun, splintering its glitter with a lazy breaststroke. To the left, the mountains are still in shadow: to the right the Porquerolles islands swim in haze - a sign of a fine day to come. </p> <p>Back at the Auberge Falaise, overlooking the beach, breakfast is ready, served on the terrace under the vine canopy. </p> <p>Three generations of the Brun family are involved in the auberge: mother and father look after the admin, son Georges is chef, and grand-daughters Celine and Caroline wait at table, but the star is daughter-in-law Anne-Marie, who is literally femme de m\u00e9nage , involved in every aspect, from cleaning the 14 rooms to chatting up the guests. Particularly chatting up the guests. If you need to know what time the boats run to the islands, which are the best beaches, and what the forecast is, ask the omniscient Anne-Marie. </p> <p>She reminded us that Thursday is market day in Le Lavandou, just 2km away by cliff path, or five minutes' drive. The olive trees covering the surrounding hills are the source of all manner of market goodies: polished bowls, chopping boards, olive oils in intimidating variety, and whole stalls of the olives themselves - purple, black, mauve, light green and olive. There are pipes made from the briars of the maquis, goat's cheeses, wine from the surrounding vineyards, almonds still in their pale furry jackets, and herbs culinary and medicinal to cure every ailment from piles to snoring. Bunches of lavender, which gives the town its name, perfumed the streets. Baby Cavaillon melons were just in season, overflowing their stalls, peaches came blanches, jaunes or \u00e0 la vigne, and someone had been up early to find an astonishing array of wild mushrooms. </p> <p>Post-war building has not done Le Lavandou any favours, but the core of the former fishing village remains resolutely proven\u00e7al. The brightly-painted fishermen's houses have been converted into a lively parade of restaurants. The five boules pitches are shaded by the traditional pleached limes, and the fountain suggests coolness in the baking summer heat. </p> <p>Boats from Le Lavandou take 50 minutes to dock at one of the offshore islands; all three are delightful but very different. For the largest, Porquerolles, take money (good restaurants, one with the area's only Michelin star), for Port Cros take walking shoes (nature reserve), for Levant take nothing, not even a bathing costume (naturist colony). </p> <p>Le Lavandou bills itself as La station aux 12 sables , but the main beach can be unpleasantly crowded; St Clair is far preferable, and there are other less obvious choices. To the east lies a series of charming little sandy bays, some discovered only by scrambling down rough unmarked tracks through the pines. </p> <p>A favourite is La Fossette. It does have a beach caf\u00e9 and parasols for hire in high season, but is otherwise unspoilt - a perfect horseshoe of fine sand, sheltered by rocky arms. Then, after two more small \"private\" beaches, comes the most sheltered of all and one of the most delightful - La Layet. Unfortunately, for some, there is a catch - like taking off all your clothes. </p> <p>Beyond Cavalaire, the corkscrewing corniche road offers staggering views down to tempting coves accessible only by boat until it descends into the little resort of Le Rayol with its lovely unsignposted beach. </p> <p>On the other side of Le Lavandou, the ugly concrete marina, camping sites and new developments take up an eye-offending chunk of the nearer coastline of the Bormes peninsula. But the western side is still much as nature intended - covered in olive and cork trees punctuated by the occasional umbrella pine. </p> <p>But there's more to the Var than seaside. Close to the coast, the mountains add another dimension. There are lovely walks behind St Clair, La Route des Marguerites, into carpets of wild flowers. In spring, wild gladioli, snapdragons and asphodels poke through the rock roses, and the air is pungent with lavender, pine, and thyme. </p> <p>Follow the mountain road towards St Tropez and, quite unexpectedly, you will find the Relais du Vieux Sauvaire, perched on an escarpment, with staggering views down to the sea. </p> <p>Bormes-les-Mimosas is a pretty name for an extremely pretty village, perched defensively above Le Lavandou. Steep stone steps are polished shiny with age, flowery courtyards encourage exploration, and some of restaurants are better than any in Le Lavandou, although priced for tourists. </p> <p>Continue further on the same mountain road for a breathtaking 25km up the Col de Babaou to find a less-contrived prettiness at Collobri\u00e8res.

      "bodyText": "Early morning is the best time on Var's St Clair beach. The beach boys are busy manicuring the ruffled sand outside their concessions with antique contraptions like cages on poles, which leave disciplined stripes like a lawnmower; then comes the hammering-in of the parasols and the laying-out of the mattresses. Take your pick from yellow at the far end of the long curving beach, then turquoise, blue, green and maroon. The big decision comes at lunchtime; shall it be moules at the maroon, or fruits de mer at the blue? St Tropez may be only 45km to the east, but it could be on another planet. The image of Riviera gloss and glitter has no relevance in this stretch of Var, whose intimate sandy beaches, divided by rocky outcrops and shaded by pines, are an abiding unsophisticated delight. An elderly Frenchman potters down into the water, trailing a thermometer on a string behind him. \"Vingt degr\u00e9s. Trop froid Madame,\" he pronounces. Not for me it's not. Not after the chilly English waters. I strike out into the bay directly into the path of the rising sun, splintering its glitter with a lazy breaststroke. To the left, the mountains are still in shadow: to the right the Porquerolles islands swim in haze - a sign of a fine day to come. Back at the Auberge Falaise, overlooking the beach, breakfast is ready, served on the terrace under the vine canopy. Three generations of the Brun family are involved in the auberge: mother and father look after the admin, son Georges is chef, and grand-daughters Celine and Caroline wait at table, but the star is daughter-in-law Anne-Marie, who is literally femme de m\u00e9nage , involved in every aspect, from cleaning the 14 rooms to chatting up the guests. Particularly chatting up the guests. If you need to know what time the boats run to the islands, which are the best beaches, and what the forecast is, ask the omniscient Anne-Marie. She reminded us that Thursday is market day in Le Lavandou, just 2km away by cliff path, or five minutes' drive. The olive trees covering the surrounding hills are the source of all manner of market goodies: polished bowls, chopping boards, olive oils in intimidating variety, and whole stalls of the olives themselves - purple, black, mauve, light green and olive. There are pipes made from the briars of the maquis, goat's cheeses, wine from the surrounding vineyards, almonds still in their pale furry jackets, and herbs culinary and medicinal to cure every ailment from piles to snoring. Bunches of lavender, which gives the town its name, perfumed the streets. Baby Cavaillon melons were just in season, overflowing their stalls, peaches came blanches, jaunes or \u00e0 la vigne, and someone had been up early to find an astonishing array of wild mushrooms. Post-war building has not done Le Lavandou any favours, but the core of the former fishing village remains resolutely proven\u00e7al. The brightly-painted fishermen's houses have been converted into a lively parade of restaurants. The five boules pitches are shaded by the traditional pleached limes, and the fountain suggests coolness in the baking summer heat. Boats from Le Lavandou take 50 minutes to dock at one of the offshore islands; all three are delightful but very different. For the largest, Porquerolles, take money (good restaurants, one with the area's only Michelin star), for Port Cros take walking shoes (nature reserve), for Levant take nothing, not even a bathing costume (naturist colony). Le Lavandou bills itself as La station aux 12 sables , but the main beach can be unpleasantly crowded; St Clair is far preferable, and there are other less obvious choices. To the east lies a series of charming little sandy bays, some discovered only by scrambling down rough unmarked tracks through the pines. A favourite is La Fossette. It does have a beach caf\u00e9 and parasols for hire in high season, but is otherwise unspoilt - a perfect horseshoe of fine sand, sheltered by rocky arms. Then, after two more small \"private\" beaches, comes the most sheltered of all and one of the most delightful - La Layet. Unfortunately, for some, there is a catch - like taking off all your clothes. Beyond Cavalaire, the corkscrewing corniche road offers staggering views down to tempting coves accessible only by boat until it descends into the little resort of Le Rayol with its lovely unsignposted beach. On the other side of Le Lavandou, the ugly concrete marina, camping sites and new developments take up an eye-offending chunk of the nearer coastline of the Bormes peninsula. But the western side is still much as nature intended - covered in olive and cork trees punctuated by the occasional umbrella pine. But there's more to the Var than seaside. Close to the coast, the mountains add another dimension. There are lovely walks behind St Clair, La Route des Marguerites, into carpets of wild flowers. In spring, wild gladioli, snapdragons and asphodels poke through the rock roses, and the air is pungent with lavender, pine, and thyme. Follow the mountain road towards St Tropez and, quite unexpectedly, you will find the Relais du Vieux Sauvaire, perched on an escarpment, with staggering views down to the sea. Bormes-les-Mimosas is a pretty name for an extremely pretty village, perched defensively above Le Lavandou. Steep stone steps are polished shiny with age, flowery courtyards encourage exploration, and some of restaurants are better than any in Le Lavandou, although priced for tourists. Continue further on the same mountain road for a breathtaking 25km up the Col de Babaou to find a less-contrived prettiness at Collobri\u00e8res. As typically proven\u00e7al a village as you could wish to find, its main products are wine and chestnuts.But its main attraction, tucked away behind an unpromising facade, is La Petite Fontaine, a tiny restaurant that has firmly resisted any attempts to change its d\u00e9cor or menu.

      "body": "<p>Freud, the father to whom all therapies are to a greater or lesser extent related, claimed that his aim through treatment was to enable people to work and love effectively. That pretty much has modern preoccupations covered. We have come a long way since the days when Freud had to analyse himself for the lack of anyone else brave enough, or qualified enough, to probe the murkiness of his unconscious. At the last count there were 400 different sorts of therapy on offer. Almost 7,000 therapists are registered with one of the two main psychotherapy organisations. In addition, there are countless unregistered therapists, who range from the inspired amateur to the extremely weird.</p> <p>Despite the apparent availability of therapy, and despite the protestations to the contrary from concerned parties, much that is on offer remains the province of the white middle classes. Although a third of general practitioners' surgeries have an in-house counsellor, NHS provision of talking treatments varies, involves long waiting times and is poorly integrated with other mainstream psychiatric services. A national review of psychotherapy services in England conducted by the NHS Executive found that people of black and minority ethnic origin, lesbians and gay men, people with chronic illness and older people were less likely to receive psychotherapy.</p> <p>As a nation we appear conflicted about the role and value of therapy. The British may be unstiffening their upper lips and learning how to express their emotions, we may alternate trips to the gym with visits to Jungian analysts, and be e-shrunk by a cyber therapist on one of the 200 separate websites giving online psychotherapy, and even stay in hotels where an on-call therapist is thrown in with the free sachets of shampoo, yet deep down we remain suspicious.</p> <p>For those of us who might be looking for a therapist it is frankly hard to know where to start. How do we find someone reliable who won't toy with our minds and feelings, and send us home more riddled with angst than when we set out? Do we even need therapy? Or should we simply cut out the booze and spend longer talking to our kids? Does any of it work? The subject of what works is a thorny issue. Very few therapists talk in terms of cure. Very little research has been done, particularly in the field of psychoanalysis, on provable outcomes. Indeed, it has never even been established in scientific terms if the most beneficial aspect is simply the therapeutic value of having the undivided attention of a rapt listener.</p> <p>The very nature of the work, which tends often to be part of an ongoing process, is not something that lends itself well to audit. How, after all, do we measure happiness?</p> <p>However, the research that has been done reveals wide ranging and positive outcomes. Therapy is not simply a tool for the worried well. People with serious mental health problems are being helped by counselling and psychotherapy. The mental health charity Mind says that long-term sufferers of schizophrenia who have recently had talking therapies made available to them say that they wish they had been able to benefit from this form of treatment earlier. The organisation interviewed 500 people who had had experiences as mental health patients, and the vast majority viewed talking therapies as \"confirming and validating\".</p> <p>People with personality difficulties, who have traditionally been considered untreatable by psychiatric services, are responding well to cognitive behavioural therapies. Research into treatments for depression shows that a combination of drugs and therapy is more effective than either on its own. Many people suffering from disabling compulsions and fears have had their lives transformed in a relatively short time by the skilful intervention of therapists. For those who have been led to a greater understanding of their deepest motivations and behaviours, for those who have been helped to work and love more effectively, therapy is irreplaceable.</p> <p>What follows is a guide to the talking therapies. It is not definitive and, although I have divided various sorts of therapy into sections, there is a great deal of overlap between them all. There is no therapy that has been proved definitively to be better than another. Research shows that it is not, in the end, the theoretical background of the therapist that is the most important factor in successful therapy, but rather the fit between the therapist and client.</p> <p>In seeking out a therapist, it is advisable, in the first instance, to consult your GP, who will know what is available in your area. If you are looking independently, the relevant organisations (see contacts panel on page 24) provide lists of registered, and therefore accredited therapists. Word of mouth is useful though not infallible: the relationship between a therapist and patient is a very personal one.</p> <p>It is also useful, at this stage, to ask of yourself what particular problem you are seeking to address, how much time and money you want to invest in the treatment and how active a role you want to take yourself. If you have experienced a crisis of some kind, it may well be that counselling, or a brief therapy, would suit you best. If, however, you feel your problems are more historical and less specific, then psychotherapy might be the most helpful approach. If one particular therapist does not suit, find another.</p> <p>All sorts of therapies are available through the NHS, but it is very hit and miss, and even if you strike lucky, you are unlikely to be offered any long-term therapy. In private treatment, \u00a330 to \u00a350 is the approximate range for an analytical hour (which actually only lasts 50 minutes), with therapists with more experience generally charging the most. Cognitive and systemic work can cost anywhere between \u00a325 to \u00a3130, but these often require far fewer sessions. Almost all therapists operate a sliding scale, and the umbrella organisations should be able to help you to find a therapist who will offer a reduced fee.</p> <p><b> Psychotherapy</b><br></p> <p><b> Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy</b></p> <p>Psychoanalysis is psychotherapy in its purest form. It is the psychotherapy that Freud devised and has formed the basis for numerous other therapies. Freud's thesis was that much of our mental activity is unconscious, and he believed that emotional disorders are caused by repressed traumatic memories of childhood. His work was to try and help patients recognise and then reconcile these hitherto hidden or forgotten aspects of their psyche into their conscious life. Since psychoanalysis proper demands at least two years of lying on a couch five times a week, as a treatment it is unsuitable for all but the very keen, or those who are training to enter the profession (most psychotherapists will have themselves undergone at least five years of therapy).</p> <p>Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is derived from psychoanalysis, but is less of a financial and time commitment. The purists (mainly the practitioners) claim that psychoanalysis is the Rolls-Royce of treatments, but most other therapists in the field say that such an in-depth analysis is not necessary. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy requires one to three sessions a week, and though the couch is still used, sometimes the patient can sit facing the therapist.</p> <p>Traditionally, the therapist tells the patient very little about themselves. The idea of presenting a blank screen is intended to enable the patient to use the therapist to experience or re-experience other past or present relationships in the relationship with the therapist. This is what is known as transference. The therapist says very little and encourages the patient to free associate: to say what first comes into their heads and thereby enable the therapist to build a picture of what is being communicated emotionally. In this way, the therapist aims to ultimately identify conflicts and inhibitions. The use of the couch and consequent lack of eye contact is said to speed up the process of reaching the more profound parts of the mind.</p> <p>The aim of psychoanalytic psychotherapy is not so much to produce happiness or fulfilment but to help subjects recognise the obstacles that are preventing them from being the people they want to be. It helps to think of the treatment as not trying simply to address the fact that a person cannot bear falling leaves, but the reason why they cannot bear falling leaves.</p> <p>Quite often a recent crisis or emotional experience might be the propulsion for seeing a therapist, but the ideal candidate for this sort of work would be someone who feels that their problems are more global and less specific. Some degree of interest in the workings of the mind and a facility for expression, though not essential, is often considered necessary for those undergoing psychoanalysis. People must be prepared for frustration and a lot of hard, often painful graft.</p> <p><b> Analytical psychology</b><br></p> <p>This school derives from the work of CG Jung. Analytical psychology and psychoanalysis come from the same source, in that they both deal with a psychodynamic way of thinking, but there are major theoretical differences, most notably in the interpretation of the unconscious and in Jung's emphasis on the connection between psyche and body. Jung and Freud fell out mainly because the former believed that Freud's theory of early traumatic experience as the cause of neurosis was too deterministic.</p> <p>Although analytical therapy still operates by bringing unconscious motivations and feelings to the conscious, it also addresses what is sometimes called the \"collective unconscious\". This is based on the idea that we, as individuals, not only have a personal history, but also share a common biological and social history. Jung felt that not only did the unconscious contain elements of repressed emotions and experiences, but that it also could contain positive things, or even things that have not yet happened.</p> <p>Broadly, the Jungian approach involves more active participation from the therapist. The aim is to explore the potential of an individual. The therapist strives to look not only at the person that has come into analysis, but at the person they might become in the future, and believes that we are all capable of taking charge of our own lives. Transference is used by most therapists in the field, although Jung himself felt it was a nuisance. Some of the work involves looking at the dreams of patients together with using images and drawings to access the unconscious.</p> <p>This therapy would suit people who either have specific problems, or who want an in-depth analysis to help them to enrich their lives or to better understand themselves. It might be useful for those who have a sense that their lives have become unbalanced, with work or the search for a successful relationship predominating at the expense of other areas. Since the emphasis is on self-fulfilment, it is perhaps of particular interest to older people, or people who have problems expressing their creativity.</p> <p><b> Family, couple, sexual and systematic therapy</b><br></p> <p>The focus of the therapies within this group is on intimate relationships rather than on the individual. Therapists work with whole families, parts of families or extended families. The theoretical basis tends to be systemic, ie, to view people in relation to each other. It explores not only how people communicate together, but what they communicate, aiming to identify and explore the patterns of belief and behaviours in roles and relationships (including sexual relationships) that seem to have become set over time, and to enable people to decide where change would be desirable.</p> <p>Systemic practitioners tend to take an active, questioning approach, which can be fairly problem focused, and the therapy is therefore usually relatively short-term. A single session can be helpful in unblocking the way people react together. Since the aim is to get groups of people or couples to work together, sessions with a therapist often act as a catalyst for change, taking place at two or three weekly intervals to enable those involved to take the work into their own lives rather than keeping it in the therapy room. Some sexual therapists use the systemic approach, but others work psychodynamically to explore current sexual problems in relation to past unresolved, and maybe unconscious, impulses and blockages.</p> <p><b> Experiential constructivist therapies</b><br></p> <p><b> Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)</b></p> <p>This therapy is based on the principle that we all carry within us a map of how we think the world works. Neuro-linguists believe that we are trying to ascribe patterns and shape meanings from the moment we are born. This sometimes results in fixed patterns of behaviour. The therapy seeks to understand an emotional state in its most basic form before it has become layered by sometimes unhelpful practice. The therapist seeks to counter the statement that a patient might make, that they know what will happen, with the question: when did you not know that?</p> <p>It tends to be a practical, directive approach. The client and therapist engage in a dialogue, with most of the work accomplished in five to eight sessions. The aim is to give clients the ability to look at their own beliefs and behaviours, to sometimes accept limitations and boundaries, but ultimately reach desired goals, or at least new versions of those goals. It is likely to benefit people who perhaps have a sense that the world is directing them and they are powerless. It may be helpful for stress-related problems, or for people who feel that they are bottling things up. NLP is also considered helpful with professional coaching.</p> <p><b> Existential Therapy</b></p> <p>The existential approach is rooted in philosophical ideas. It has at its basis the desire to search for truth rather than fitting the client into pre-established frameworks of interpretation. Unlike some other therapies, which claim that there is a healthy and an unhealthy way of thinking and living, the existential position is that we all have to find out our own unique way of being. It is much less theory-driven than, say, psychoanalysis, and is more akin to NLP in that it stresses the importance of the individual.</p> <p>Existentialists do not draw on scientific views nor use concepts of the unconscious to explain behaviour, but focus more on how we avoid taking responsibility for who we are. They strive to try and make the individual aware that they are making choices on a day-to-day basis and that it might be more useful if these choices are made clearly and not brushed over. Existentialists believe that although human beings are connected to each other, they are fundamentally alone. This aloneness gives humans a sort of freedom, because it enables them to imagine and create themselves in any way that they wish.</p> <p>The work tends not to focus on one problem, but to look at the person as a whole, as someone who is in a constant state of becoming. Generally, the therapy takes a long time, but since existentialists avoid naming goals, the length of therapy depends very much on the individual.</p> <p>It would appeal more to people who want to have a deeper look at their lives or review where they are in the world, and who prefer to think for themselves rather than be told what is wrong with them. It may be suitable for people who feel that they are outsiders or who are facing a crisis or a change of direction.</p> <p><b> Hypno-Psychotherapy</b></p> <p>This therapy has struggled for validation against charges that it is not a real psychotherapy. Also it has had trouble casting off its image as a tool used by stage hypnotists to make unsuspecting members of the public perform humiliating acts. Hypnosis has been practised for centuries in some form or other. Freud himself used it as a technique to access the unconscious.</p> <p>Present-day hypno-psychotherapy understands that we have a learned model of the world that can restrict the way we feel, what we understand, our attitudes and behaviour. Hypnosis is a state of relaxation that people enter voluntarily, during which there occurs an altered state of conscious awareness. Contrary to popular belief, the person undergoing hypnosis is conscious throughout the process. During hypnosis the therapist can intervene to draw the individual's attention to new possibilities, to alternative patterns of thought, emotions and behaviour.</p> <p>The work is tailored to an individual's needs. Nothing is suggested under hypnosis that has not been agreed before in discussion. The cognitive motivations are examined in detail with the client in order to formulate the \"script\" used by practitioners to induce hypnosis and suggest change. Disclosure techniques such as \"regression\" are sometimes used to address more deep-seated problems. The length of treatment is also directed by the client. This therapy appears particularly useful for dealing with problems in the here and now. Much of its success is dependent on an individual's willingness to participate in the process. Some therapists specialise in particular areas. It is suitable for people with addictions such as smoking and alcohol, stress, anxiety, depression, fears, phobias, pain relief, weight loss, post-traumatic stress disorder and insomnia.</p> <p><b> Clinical psychology</b><br></p> <p><b> Cognitive Behavioural Therapy</b></p> <p>Purely behavioural treatments focus on overt behaviour and the environment, rather than the subjective experiences or internal forces that are assumed to underlie the problem. Individuals are taught to face the situations that lead to anxiety and learn to deal with them. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) developed partly out of a dissatisfaction with the limitations of behavioural therapy, and partly a dissatisfaction with traditional psychotherapies of the analytical type. Its aim is to try and change both a person's cognitions (mental processes, perceptions and assumptions) and their behaviour. Disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are sustained by a vicious circle. The behaviour itself (excessive hand washing, for instance) seems to relieve anxiety which, in turn, reinforces the original belief. The principle is that people who are anxious or depressed have different cognitions from people who are happy and confident. The real difference between people who are confident and anxious isn't that one group is having all the good luck, and the others aren't, it is how they perceive their own reality and the way they make sense of what is happening to them.</p> <p>The cognitive approach seeks to help clients identify and then modify those thoughts that are leading to maladaptive behaviours. It is a collaborative process that involves client and therapist working together on routes to take that feel safe and manageable. Together they seek to uncover the interpretations and evaluations that might be contributing to a client's distortion of the world. You may feel you are dying, but what is the evidence? The therapist teaches the client to recognise negative automatic thoughts, look for alternatives and to utilise the \"what if\" technique (for example, What if you did miss the train? What would be the worst thing that could happen?).</p> <p>Because this is, in a sense, a results-based discipline, there has been more research carried out on its effectiveness, and results on the whole are positive - anxiety states take 12 to 16 weeks to address, but due to its popularity, resources are stretched. It is available on the NHS by clinical psychologists and a growing number of specially trained nurses.</p> <p>It is most useful for people who feel that they have something that is making their life difficult and that is preventing them from functioning normally, for example various anxiety problems such as OCD, panic disorders, depression, relationship problems and compulsive behaviour. Because of the collaborative nature of the therapy, those undergoing CBT should be willing to participate actively and be prepared to carry out home-work assignments.</p> <p><b> Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy</b></p> <p>Generally considered to be less collaborative and more directive than CBT, rational emotive behaviour therapy (REBT) was established in 1955 by Albert Ellis. The basic premise is that human beings have two basic biological drives: a tendency towards irrationality; and the potential to change. Therapists believe that people perpetuate their psychological disturbance because of their own theories concerning the cause of their problems. They tend to attribute the cause of their problems to situations rather than to their beliefs about these situations. Because they are unaware of this, they continually reindoctrinate themselves with these beliefs. Practitioners have also identified a reluctance to address change on the part of patients as being due to their unwillingness to move out of their comfort zone, and also a tendency to be anxious about their own anxiety.</p> <p>The goals of therapy are to help people to make profound philosophical changes that would involve them giving up their irrational demands on themselves and others, accepting themselves unconditionally and increasing their tolerance for frustration. The therapy can be offered on a longer- or shorter-term basis and is best suited to treating specific problems that can be identified and articulated.</p> <p><b> Humanistic &amp; integrative psychotherapy</b><br></p> <p>The premise of the humanistic outlook is that people must be understood in the context of their own unique experience. There is no single, clear theoretical focus, but a reliance on a connected network of ideas. Therapists believe that psychology alone cannot define what makes a person uniquely human, and that we have to draw from many other fields outside psychology and medicine in order to understand the human condition. It encourages individuals to find the potential for change within themselves.</p> <p>A major difference between the humanistic therapies and psychoanalysis is that any assessment of the client using standard tools is seen to go against the therapeutic relationship. The interaction of therapist and client is viewed as a dialogue, exploring what happened in the past and expressing emotions that have been held in the body since that time. The goal is to help the patient transfer the gains they have made through an increased awareness into everyday life. It is essentially an optimistic type of therapy concerned with human potential.</p> <p><b> Gestalt Therapy</b></p> <p>Gestalt was first developed as a therapy by Fritz and Laura Perls in the 50s and is now one of the main humanistic therapies. It focuses on developing authentic relations in the present, respect for the individual details of each person's experience (phenomenology) and a range of expressive techniques (including imagery and enactment).

      "bodyText": "Freud, the father to whom all therapies are to a greater or lesser extent related, claimed that his aim through treatment was to enable people to work and love effectively. That pretty much has modern preoccupations covered. We have come a long way since the days when Freud had to analyse himself for the lack of anyone else brave enough, or qualified enough, to probe the murkiness of his unconscious. At the last count there were 400 different sorts of therapy on offer. Almost 7,000 therapists are registered with one of the two main psychotherapy organisations. In addition, there are countless unregistered therapists, who range from the inspired amateur to the extremely weird. Despite the apparent availability of therapy, and despite the protestations to the contrary from concerned parties, much that is on offer remains the province of the white middle classes. Although a third of general practitioners' surgeries have an in-house counsellor, NHS provision of talking treatments varies, involves long waiting times and is poorly integrated with other mainstream psychiatric services. A national review of psychotherapy services in England conducted by the NHS Executive found that people of black and minority ethnic origin, lesbians and gay men, people with chronic illness and older people were less likely to receive psychotherapy. As a nation we appear conflicted about the role and value of therapy. The British may be unstiffening their upper lips and learning how to express their emotions, we may alternate trips to the gym with visits to Jungian analysts, and be e-shrunk by a cyber therapist on one of the 200 separate websites giving online psychotherapy, and even stay in hotels where an on-call therapist is thrown in with the free sachets of shampoo, yet deep down we remain suspicious. For those of us who might be looking for a therapist it is frankly hard to know where to start. How do we find someone reliable who won't toy with our minds and feelings, and send us home more riddled with angst than when we set out? Do we even need therapy? Or should we simply cut out the booze and spend longer talking to our kids? Does any of it work? The subject of what works is a thorny issue. Very few therapists talk in terms of cure. Very little research has been done, particularly in the field of psychoanalysis, on provable outcomes. Indeed, it has never even been established in scientific terms if the most beneficial aspect is simply the therapeutic value of having the undivided attention of a rapt listener. The very nature of the work, which tends often to be part of an ongoing process, is not something that lends itself well to audit. How, after all, do we measure happiness? However, the research that has been done reveals wide ranging and positive outcomes. Therapy is not simply a tool for the worried well. People with serious mental health problems are being helped by counselling and psychotherapy. The mental health charity Mind says that long-term sufferers of schizophrenia who have recently had talking therapies made available to them say that they wish they had been able to benefit from this form of treatment earlier. The organisation interviewed 500 people who had had experiences as mental health patients, and the vast majority viewed talking therapies as \"confirming and validating\". People with personality difficulties, who have traditionally been considered untreatable by psychiatric services, are responding well to cognitive behavioural therapies. Research into treatments for depression shows that a combination of drugs and therapy is more effective than either on its own. Many people suffering from disabling compulsions and fears have had their lives transformed in a relatively short time by the skilful intervention of therapists. For those who have been led to a greater understanding of their deepest motivations and behaviours, for those who have been helped to work and love more effectively, therapy is irreplaceable. What follows is a guide to the talking therapies. It is not definitive and, although I have divided various sorts of therapy into sections, there is a great deal of overlap between them all. There is no therapy that has been proved definitively to be better than another. Research shows that it is not, in the end, the theoretical background of the therapist that is the most important factor in successful therapy, but rather the fit between the therapist and client. In seeking out a therapist, it is advisable, in the first instance, to consult your GP, who will know what is available in your area. If you are looking independently, the relevant organisations (see contacts panel on page 24) provide lists of registered, and therefore accredited therapists. Word of mouth is useful though not infallible: the relationship between a therapist and patient is a very personal one. It is also useful, at this stage, to ask of yourself what particular problem you are seeking to address, how much time and money you want to invest in the treatment and how active a role you want to take yourself. If you have experienced a crisis of some kind, it may well be that counselling, or a brief therapy, would suit you best. If, however, you feel your problems are more historical and less specific, then psychotherapy might be the most helpful approach. If one particular therapist does not suit, find another. All sorts of therapies are available through the NHS, but it is very hit and miss, and even if you strike lucky, you are unlikely to be offered any long-term therapy. In private treatment, \u00a330 to \u00a350 is the approximate range for an analytical hour (which actually only lasts 50 minutes), with therapists with more experience generally charging the most. Cognitive and systemic work can cost anywhere between \u00a325 to \u00a3130, but these often require far fewer sessions. Almost all therapists operate a sliding scale, and the umbrella organisations should be able to help you to find a therapist who will offer a reduced fee. Psychotherapy Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy Psychoanalysis is psychotherapy in its purest form. It is the psychotherapy that Freud devised and has formed the basis for numerous other therapies. Freud's thesis was that much of our mental activity is unconscious, and he believed that emotional disorders are caused by repressed traumatic memories of childhood. His work was to try and help patients recognise and then reconcile these hitherto hidden or forgotten aspects of their psyche into their conscious life. Since psychoanalysis proper demands at least two years of lying on a couch five times a week, as a treatment it is unsuitable for all but the very keen, or those who are training to enter the profession (most psychotherapists will have themselves undergone at least five years of therapy). Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is derived from psychoanalysis, but is less of a financial and time commitment. The purists (mainly the practitioners) claim that psychoanalysis is the Rolls-Royce of treatments, but most other therapists in the field say that such an in-depth analysis is not necessary. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy requires one to three sessions a week, and though the couch is still used, sometimes the patient can sit facing the therapist. Traditionally, the therapist tells the patient very little about themselves. The idea of presenting a blank screen is intended to enable the patient to use the therapist to experience or re-experience other past or present relationships in the relationship with the therapist. This is what is known as transference. The therapist says very little and encourages the patient to free associate: to say what first comes into their heads and thereby enable the therapist to build a picture of what is being communicated emotionally. In this way, the therapist aims to ultimately identify conflicts and inhibitions. The use of the couch and consequent lack of eye contact is said to speed up the process of reaching the more profound parts of the mind. The aim of psychoanalytic psychotherapy is not so much to produce happiness or fulfilment but to help subjects recognise the obstacles that are preventing them from being the people they want to be. It helps to think of the treatment as not trying simply to address the fact that a person cannot bear falling leaves, but the reason why they cannot bear falling leaves. Quite often a recent crisis or emotional experience might be the propulsion for seeing a therapist, but the ideal candidate for this sort of work would be someone who feels that their problems are more global and less specific. Some degree of interest in the workings of the mind and a facility for expression, though not essential, is often considered necessary for those undergoing psychoanalysis. People must be prepared for frustration and a lot of hard, often painful graft. Analytical psychology This school derives from the work of CG Jung. Analytical psychology and psychoanalysis come from the same source, in that they both deal with a psychodynamic way of thinking, but there are major theoretical differences, most notably in the interpretation of the unconscious and in Jung's emphasis on the connection between psyche and body. Jung and Freud fell out mainly because the former believed that Freud's theory of early traumatic experience as the cause of neurosis was too deterministic. Although analytical therapy still operates by bringing unconscious motivations and feelings to the conscious, it also addresses what is sometimes called the \"collective unconscious\". This is based on the idea that we, as individuals, not only have a personal history, but also share a common biological and social history. Jung felt that not only did the unconscious contain elements of repressed emotions and experiences, but that it also could contain positive things, or even things that have not yet happened. Broadly, the Jungian approach involves more active participation from the therapist. The aim is to explore the potential of an individual. The therapist strives to look not only at the person that has come into analysis, but at the person they might become in the future, and believes that we are all capable of taking charge of our own lives. Transference is used by most therapists in the field, although Jung himself felt it was a nuisance. Some of the work involves looking at the dreams of patients together with using images and drawings to access the unconscious. This therapy would suit people who either have specific problems, or who want an in-depth analysis to help them to enrich their lives or to better understand themselves. It might be useful for those who have a sense that their lives have become unbalanced, with work or the search for a successful relationship predominating at the expense of other areas. Since the emphasis is on self-fulfilment, it is perhaps of particular interest to older people, or people who have problems expressing their creativity. Family, couple, sexual and systematic therapy The focus of the therapies within this group is on intimate relationships rather than on the individual. Therapists work with whole families, parts of families or extended families. The theoretical basis tends to be systemic, ie, to view people in relation to each other. It explores not only how people communicate together, but what they communicate, aiming to identify and explore the patterns of belief and behaviours in roles and relationships (including sexual relationships) that seem to have become set over time, and to enable people to decide where change would be desirable. Systemic practitioners tend to take an active, questioning approach, which can be fairly problem focused, and the therapy is therefore usually relatively short-term. A single session can be helpful in unblocking the way people react together. Since the aim is to get groups of people or couples to work together, sessions with a therapist often act as a catalyst for change, taking place at two or three weekly intervals to enable those involved to take the work into their own lives rather than keeping it in the therapy room. Some sexual therapists use the systemic approach, but others work psychodynamically to explore current sexual problems in relation to past unresolved, and maybe unconscious, impulses and blockages. Experiential constructivist therapies Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) This therapy is based on the principle that we all carry within us a map of how we think the world works. Neuro-linguists believe that we are trying to ascribe patterns and shape meanings from the moment we are born. This sometimes results in fixed patterns of behaviour. The therapy seeks to understand an emotional state in its most basic form before it has become layered by sometimes unhelpful practice. The therapist seeks to counter the statement that a patient might make, that they know what will happen, with the question: when did you not know that? It tends to be a practical, directive approach. The client and therapist engage in a dialogue, with most of the work accomplished in five to eight sessions. The aim is to give clients the ability to look at their own beliefs and behaviours, to sometimes accept limitations and boundaries, but ultimately reach desired goals, or at least new versions of those goals. It is likely to benefit people who perhaps have a sense that the world is directing them and they are powerless. It may be helpful for stress-related problems, or for people who feel that they are bottling things up. NLP is also considered helpful with professional coaching. Existential Therapy The existential approach is rooted in philosophical ideas. It has at its basis the desire to search for truth rather than fitting the client into pre-established frameworks of interpretation. Unlike some other therapies, which claim that there is a healthy and an unhealthy way of thinking and living, the existential position is that we all have to find out our own unique way of being. It is much less theory-driven than, say, psychoanalysis, and is more akin to NLP in that it stresses the importance of the individual. Existentialists do not draw on scientific views nor use concepts of the unconscious to explain behaviour, but focus more on how we avoid taking responsibility for who we are. They strive to try and make the individual aware that they are making choices on a day-to-day basis and that it might be more useful if these choices are made clearly and not brushed over. Existentialists believe that although human beings are connected to each other, they are fundamentally alone. This aloneness gives humans a sort of freedom, because it enables them to imagine and create themselves in any way that they wish. The work tends not to focus on one problem, but to look at the person as a whole, as someone who is in a constant state of becoming. Generally, the therapy takes a long time, but since existentialists avoid naming goals, the length of therapy depends very much on the individual. It would appeal more to people who want to have a deeper look at their lives or review where they are in the world, and who prefer to think for themselves rather than be told what is wrong with them. It may be suitable for people who feel that they are outsiders or who are facing a crisis or a change of direction. Hypno-Psychotherapy This therapy has struggled for validation against charges that it is not a real psychotherapy. Also it has had trouble casting off its image as a tool used by stage hypnotists to make unsuspecting members of the public perform humiliating acts. Hypnosis has been practised for centuries in some form or other. Freud himself used it as a technique to access the unconscious. Present-day hypno-psychotherapy understands that we have a learned model of the world that can restrict the way we feel, what we understand, our attitudes and behaviour. Hypnosis is a state of relaxation that people enter voluntarily, during which there occurs an altered state of conscious awareness. Contrary to popular belief, the person undergoing hypnosis is conscious throughout the process. During hypnosis the therapist can intervene to draw the individual's attention to new possibilities, to alternative patterns of thought, emotions and behaviour. The work is tailored to an individual's needs. Nothing is suggested under hypnosis that has not been agreed before in discussion. The cognitive motivations are examined in detail with the client in order to formulate the \"script\" used by practitioners to induce hypnosis and suggest change. Disclosure techniques such as \"regression\" are sometimes used to address more deep-seated problems. The length of treatment is also directed by the client. This therapy appears particularly useful for dealing with problems in the here and now. Much of its success is dependent on an individual's willingness to participate in the process. Some therapists specialise in particular areas. It is suitable for people with addictions such as smoking and alcohol, stress, anxiety, depression, fears, phobias, pain relief, weight loss, post-traumatic stress disorder and insomnia. Clinical psychology Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Purely behavioural treatments focus on overt behaviour and the environment, rather than the subjective experiences or internal forces that are assumed to underlie the problem. Individuals are taught to face the situations that lead to anxiety and learn to deal with them. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) developed partly out of a dissatisfaction with the limitations of behavioural therapy, and partly a dissatisfaction with traditional psychotherapies of the analytical type. Its aim is to try and change both a person's cognitions (mental processes, perceptions and assumptions) and their behaviour. Disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are sustained by a vicious circle. The behaviour itself (excessive hand washing, for instance) seems to relieve anxiety which, in turn, reinforces the original belief. The principle is that people who are anxious or depressed have different cognitions from people who are happy and confident. The real difference between people who are confident and anxious isn't that one group is having all the good luck, and the others aren't, it is how they perceive their own reality and the way they make sense of what is happening to them. The cognitive approach seeks to help clients identify and then modify those thoughts that are leading to maladaptive behaviours. It is a collaborative process that involves client and therapist working together on routes to take that feel safe and manageable. Together they seek to uncover the interpretations and evaluations that might be contributing to a client's distortion of the world. You may feel you are dying, but what is the evidence? The therapist teaches the client to recognise negative automatic thoughts, look for alternatives and to utilise the \"what if\" technique (for example, What if you did miss the train? What would be the worst thing that could happen?). Because this is, in a sense, a results-based discipline, there has been more research carried out on its effectiveness, and results on the whole are positive - anxiety states take 12 to 16 weeks to address, but due to its popularity, resources are stretched. It is available on the NHS by clinical psychologists and a growing number of specially trained nurses. It is most useful for people who feel that they have something that is making their life difficult and that is preventing them from functioning normally, for example various anxiety problems such as OCD, panic disorders, depression, relationship problems and compulsive behaviour. Because of the collaborative nature of the therapy, those undergoing CBT should be willing to participate actively and be prepared to carry out home-work assignments. Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy Generally considered to be less collaborative and more directive than CBT, rational emotive behaviour therapy (REBT) was established in 1955 by Albert Ellis. The basic premise is that human beings have two basic biological drives: a tendency towards irrationality; and the potential to change. Therapists believe that people perpetuate their psychological disturbance because of their own theories concerning the cause of their problems. They tend to attribute the cause of their problems to situations rather than to their beliefs about these situations. Because they are unaware of this, they continually reindoctrinate themselves with these beliefs. Practitioners have also identified a reluctance to address change on the part of patients as being due to their unwillingness to move out of their comfort zone, and also a tendency to be anxious about their own anxiety. The goals of therapy are to help people to make profound philosophical changes that would involve them giving up their irrational demands on themselves and others, accepting themselves unconditionally and increasing their tolerance for frustration. The therapy can be offered on a longer- or shorter-term basis and is best suited to treating specific problems that can be identified and articulated. Humanistic &amp; integrative psychotherapy The premise of the humanistic outlook is that people must be understood in the context of their own unique experience. There is no single, clear theoretical focus, but a reliance on a connected network of ideas. Therapists believe that psychology alone cannot define what makes a person uniquely human, and that we have to draw from many other fields outside psychology and medicine in order to understand the human condition. It encourages individuals to find the potential for change within themselves. A major difference between the humanistic therapies and psychoanalysis is that any assessment of the client using standard tools is seen to go against the therapeutic relationship. The interaction of therapist and client is viewed as a dialogue, exploring what happened in the past and expressing emotions that have been held in the body since that time. The goal is to help the patient transfer the gains they have made through an increased awareness into everyday life. It is essentially an optimistic type of therapy concerned with human potential. Gestalt Therapy Gestalt was first developed as a therapy by Fritz and Laura Perls in the 50s and is now one of the main humanistic therapies. It focuses on developing authentic relations in the present, respect for the individual details of each person's experience (phenomenology) and a range of expressive techniques (including imagery and enactment). Gestaltists believe that we are wired as human beings to make sense of the world and to create a wholeness or a complete picture of experience and feelings. They say that before the age of seven we develop ways of acting (or fixed gestalts), which at the time may have been adequate coping mechanisms but have now become inefficient. The therapist doesn't analyse the patient, but rather helps the patient to highlight their awareness. The idea is that the only truth we can know is what is happening in the present moment. Gestaltists believe that you have to understand a person within their context: race, family, culture and religion. This means a good Gestalt therapist would not have any presuppositions about the patient. They wouldn't, for instance, say a snake has sexual connotations, because if the patient comes from a country in which snakes are commonplace, their dreams about snakes are going to have a different significance than those of a person who has never seen a snake outside of a zoo. Once the therapy has made the patient truly aware of their fixed Gestalts, it moves on to experimenting with different ways of being. This method of enactment and role play sets Gestalt apart from most other therapies. Working on the idea that our nervous systems cannot tell the difference between a real experience and a vividly imagined experience, the patient can address unfinished business through the use of imagination, dreams and fantasies. Most therapists do couple and family work as well as individual therapy. The therapy tends to be long term. Transactional Analysis As first developed by Eric Berne (1958), this is a multifaceted system of psychotherapy. It is both a theory of personality and a system for the improvement of personal and social functioning. Transactional analysis (TA) has been subjected to some charges of shallowness due to its huge popularity in the 60s with Thomas A Harris's book, I'm OK - You're OK. In fact, it is a deceptively simple therapy which is couched in a methodology that is easy to understand. Berne felt that thinking about the way we feel and behave should be accessible to everyone. TA concepts such as the \"inner child\" and \"psychological games\" have become absorbed into popular vocabulary. TA takes its starting point from Freud's theory of the ego. It identifies three ego states: The Parent, The Adult and The Child. It aims to clarify life experiences by examining how we learned our beliefs and values from our parents and other parent figures, and how being in different ego states can influence our behaviour and relationships. TA looks at the way that we hang on to sometimes unhelpful \"life scripts\" and play games as methods of survival, at the expense of fulfilment and self-realisation. There are three main types of TA analyst: the clinical practitioner, who does psychotherapy; the educational analyst; and the organisational analyst, whose work involves looking at transactions that take place in the work place. This type of therapy is usually offered weekly and is practised both in groups and individually. Cognitive Analytic Therapy This therapy is an integration of mainly cognitive and psychoanalytic approaches. There is a clear emphasis on working collaboratively with clients, the purpose being to enable them to gain a coherent and memorable understanding of past un-met needs, unmanageable feelings and how these combine to play a role in maintaining present difficulties. As an integrative model, CAT responds adaptively to each client; it looks at the bigger picture of the client's psychological world and explains it in clear ways that enable the person to feel less trapped and more able to care for themselves and do their own psychological self-help homework outside the session. It works with individuals but also can be used with couples and groups. The aim is to link present interpersonal difficulties with early life experience. Although this therapy uses techniques such as transference within the therapeutic relationship, it is much briefer and more focused than psychoanalytic therapy, generally involving 16 sessions. It uses active methods such as psychological education, diary keeping, diagrams and letter writing. Counselling Counselling is simply a description of a role rather than a particular theoretical practice; it embodies a wide range of techniques and approaches, from specific advice and treatment programmes, through to longer term psychotherapy. Although professionals in the field tend to emphasise the difference between counselling and psychotherapy, the differences that do exist are to a large extent based on length of training. Psychotherapists tend to undergo a longer training, although some counsellors have trained for many years. As a general rule of thumb, if part of your life is a problem, see a counsellor, whereas if the whole of your life is a problem, see a psychotherapist.

A four-day pass costs $139 (about \u00a395), which represents a saving of 35%. You need to pay at least 14 days before arrival.

You must stay away for at least one Saturday night and no more than a month and you have to take two specific flights - the 3.05pm out, which arrives at 5.25pm and the 1.30pm back, which gets in at 2.20pm.

      "body": "<p>It's an unusually busy day at the bank in Cap d'Agde. The nearby cashpoint machine has broken down, so all the customers are having to come in to get their money. A smartly-dressed woman employee dispenses the cash, and a man beside her deals with the resulting tide of paperwork. A long queue of people snakes its way across to the door, but the mood is patient and relaxed. After all, they're here on their holidays, and they have all the time in the world. </p> <p>It's just like any bank anywhere, except for one minor detail: many of the customers are naked. It's like one of those dreams where you're walking down a busy shopping street and half the people, yourself included, seem to have forgotten to put on any clothes. </p> <p>This is the quartier naturiste of Cap d'Agde in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of southern France, and scenes like this are everywhere one looks. It is an entire self- contained naked town with its own shops, post offices, petrol station, and a choice of around 30 restaurants and bars. In the height of summer, tens of thousands of people flock here from all over the world. </p> <p>The resort even has its own branch of the Spar supermarket chain, probably the only one in the world where clothed male checkout assistants struggle to stay awake as dozens of nude women await their attention. </p> <p>Stripping off on Cap d'Agde's 2km of beautiful beach is no big deal. On a normal beach, you're wearing only one or two garments anyway, so wearing none at all seems pretty natural, especially when the temperature is in the 90s and everyone else is naked. But trundling a supermarket trolley around the aisles while clad in nothing but a baseball cap and a bemused smile is something you won't get used to in a month of Sundays. </p> <p>The quartier naturiste is part of the much bigger purpose-built \"textile\" (ie clothed) resort of Cap d'Agde. To be honest, it's not much to look at. This may be the country that gave us Versailles and the chteaux of the Loire, but in the 60s and 70s France's architects seem to have undergone some sort of collective brainstorm. They built all those uniquely horrible ski resorts in the Alps, and they built Cap d'Agde. </p> <p>The brutalist concrete apartment blocks are visible for miles around, and many of the apartments themselves are hardly big enough to swing a cat in. But no one comes to Cap d'Agde for the buildings. If the weather is good (which it invariably is in summer) you're out all day anyway, enjoying the resort's many attractions. And for those needing a little more room to move, there are always the pretty, bougainvillea-clad villas, the smart, modern three-star Hotel Eve, or the huge but tranquil and leafy campsite. </p> <p>For a naturist resort, it's amazing just how preoccupied people are by clothing. One couple arriving at the same time as my wife and myself were struggling under the weight of five large suitcases. This is because when the sun goes down, the people dress up. A few hardy souls remain nude for the duration of their stay, sometimes being the only naked diners in a restaurant full of clothed people. </p> <p>On the beach, the vast majority of people strip off; and official patrols come round and politely insist that you do so unless you have a very good reason. They are known as \"black hats\", because that is all they wear. </p> <p>Away from the beach, some dress, others don't. During one heavy shower of rain we were treated to the bizarre spectacle of people walking around in raincoats with nothing underneath. </p> <p>Clothes are also one of the main commodities sold in the shops. Many of these seem to be made of PVC and rubber, which raises the obvious question about a naturist resort: isn't there a sexual undertone to all this? </p> <p>Well, many naturists will deny it, but there is, though the sex is pretty much corralled away from the eyes of the many thousands of people who come here for a wholesome family holiday. A small minority parade around in fetish gear later on in the evening; there are two couples-only, anything-goes \"nightclubs\", and hanky-panky of varying degrees of furtiveness occurs on the section of beach farthest from the resort. However, the beach is patrolled by police, and their new chief is reportedly much less liberal than his predecessor. </p> <p>And what about gawkers? Yes, they do exist, because anyone is allowed in through the main gate provided they pay their entrance fee. Sometimes a group of spotty, sniggering and seriously-overdressed teenage males will sidle along the beach. But the great thing about Cap d'Agde is the feeling of safety in numbers. Nakedness is the norm, and it creates an extraordinary camaraderie; in this topsy-turvy society, it's the people with clothes on that feel out of place. </p> <p>For this reason, too, women should feel fairly secure. There is a slight preponderance of males, not all of whom are very good at making eye contact when they speak to you, but the overall atmosphere is friendly and protective. </p> <p>Cap d'Agde distorts your whole system of values, because it makes you feel this is normal and it's the rest of the world that's got it wrong. When you walk out of the main gate at the end of your stay, it clangs shut behind you with a depressing finality. Back in the real world, you get an inkling of what Adam and Eve must have felt like when they were expelled from Paradise.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>British Airways (0345 222111) flies London Gatwick to Montpellier for around \u00a3188 return.

The brutalist concrete apartment blocks are visible for miles around, and many of the apartments themselves are hardly big enough to swing a cat in. But no one comes to Cap d'Agde for the buildings. If the weather is good (which it invariably is in summer) you're out all day anyway, enjoying the resort's many attractions. And for those needing a little more room to move, there are always the pretty, bougainvillea-clad villas, the smart, modern three-star Hotel Eve, or the huge but tranquil and leafy campsite. For a naturist resort, it's amazing just how preoccupied people are by clothing. One couple arriving at the same time as my wife and myself were struggling under the weight of five large suitcases. This is because when the sun goes down, the people dress up. A few hardy souls remain nude for the duration of their stay, sometimes being the only naked diners in a restaurant full of clothed people. On the beach, the vast majority of people strip off; and official patrols come round and politely insist that you do so unless you have a very good reason. They are known as \"black hats\", because that is all they wear. Away from the beach, some dress, others don't. During one heavy shower of rain we were treated to the bizarre spectacle of people walking around in raincoats with nothing underneath. Clothes are also one of the main commodities sold in the shops. Many of these seem to be made of PVC and rubber, which raises the obvious question about a naturist resort: isn't there a sexual undertone to all this? Well, many naturists will deny it, but there is, though the sex is pretty much corralled away from the eyes of the many thousands of people who come here for a wholesome family holiday. A small minority parade around in fetish gear later on in the evening; there are two couples-only, anything-goes \"nightclubs\", and hanky-panky of varying degrees of furtiveness occurs on the section of beach farthest from the resort. However, the beach is patrolled by police, and their new chief is reportedly much less liberal than his predecessor. And what about gawkers? Yes, they do exist, because anyone is allowed in through the main gate provided they pay their entrance fee. Sometimes a group of spotty, sniggering and seriously-overdressed teenage males will sidle along the beach. But the great thing about Cap d'Agde is the feeling of safety in numbers. Nakedness is the norm, and it creates an extraordinary camaraderie; in this topsy-turvy society, it's the people with clothes on that feel out of place. For this reason, too, women should feel fairly secure. There is a slight preponderance of males, not all of whom are very good at making eye contact when they speak to you, but the overall atmosphere is friendly and protective. Cap d'Agde distorts your whole system of values, because it makes you feel this is normal and it's the rest of the world that's got it wrong. When you walk out of the main gate at the end of your stay, it clangs shut behind you with a depressing finality. Back in the real world, you get an inkling of what Adam and Eve must have felt like when they were expelled from Paradise. The practicals British Airways (0345 222111) flies London Gatwick to Montpellier for around \u00a3188 return. Eurostar (0870 1606600) costs from \u00a3120 from London Waterloo to Agde via Lille.

For example, stay in a restored farmhouse, located on a working farm, 9km from the tiny village of Duras (pop 1,200).

This year it takes place from February 8-27, and Sovereign Cities is offering special deals between now and March. Last tango in Paris And for something a little different, try a last tango in Paris with a new weekend break from Dance Holidays. Spend mornings taking tango lessons and evenings at tango and salsa clubs, accompanied by your tutor and group. Sovereign Cities (0870 576 8373) offers four nights for the price of three at a selection of hotels in Nice, including the four-star Hotel West End, \u00a3279 per person including return flights and breakfast. Dance Holidays (01206 577000) cost \u00a3299pp for a two-night break at the three-star Hotel Central, including tuition and return travel on Eurostar.",

Insolvent by 1657, he spent his last decade - from which this painting comes - in poverty and isolation. </p> <p> <strong>Subject: </strong>The artist. Rembrandt painted, drew and engraved self-portraits throughout his career, at first studying his face physiognomically, later advertising himself, then in his last years creating an art of self-scrutiny. </p> <p> <strong>Distinguishing features:</strong> This is a defiant image, proclaiming Rembrandt's courage and awareness of his place in history. Yet it is also a melancholy painting. Rembrandt gives himself a daunting quality, belying his fall from the heights of success to a position on the margins of Dutch society. He has a Prospero-like power. Key to this power is the mysterious drawing on the wall behind him. Two fragments of hemispheres have been marked out, a map without details, a globe whose nations have not yet been named. Like God, the painter makes a world; like God, he separates the darkness and the light and names things. </p> <p>This divine creator, however, must first create himself. Rembrandt is frank about how much the struggle to make art has cost him. To exist is as much a miracle as anything he might put on canvas. Go close to this painting and it disintegrates into mounds and tufts of paint, only the deep, dark eyes remaining. It is a painting of feints, false starts, hands half-painted, brushes and palette a brown blur. These gestures of hesitancy acknowledge, even as the aggressive pose of the artist insists otherwise, the difficulty of representing anything. </p> <p>His face, tenderised by time, looks at us with pity. He is the one who was shamed, who lost everything. Who is he to look at us in that judging yet merciful way? Rembrandt's authority lies in his clothes. He is wearing a robe lined with fur, a red garment underneath, and a painter's hat, his crown. Their nobility takes him out of his time, and places him in a world of archaic magnificence - the realm of History. </p> <p>History is what distinguishes Rembrandt from his contemporaries. Near where this picture hangs, in Kenwood House, London, is a portrait by Frans Hals, which charmingly captures a moment of life. Rembrandt rejects that immediacy; even when he paints his own wife she is at once herself and the goddess Flora. Rembrandt's paintings enact a disturbance of time. He looks at us across the centuries because, set free from time, his paintings establish a space as open to us as to his contemporaries. </p> <p>In 1653 Rembrandt painted the philosopher Aristotle contemplating a bust of Homer. Aristotle in that painting is a worldly man; a gold chain is wrapped round his body. He looks miserable as he studies the bust of the blind, impoverished, itinerant bard - the artist. Better to be Homer than Aristotle, better to be an artist whose creation lives forever than a worldly success dragged down by gold chains. </p> <p>In his 1663 self-portrait, Rembrandt looks at us, and like Aristotle contemplating Homer, we are chastened. </p> <p><strong> Inspirations and influences: </strong> Rembrandt's self-awareness as an artist owes something to Titian's Portrait of a Man (c 1512), purportedly of the poet Ariosto, which he saw in the house of an art collector in Amsterdam and emulated in his 1640 Self-portrait (both in the National Gallery). </p> <p><strong> Where is it? </strong>The Iveagh Bequest, Kenwood House, London NW3 (020-8348 1286). </p>",

He is the one who was shamed, who lost everything. Who is he to look at us in that judging yet merciful way? Rembrandt's authority lies in his clothes. He is wearing a robe lined with fur, a red garment underneath, and a painter's hat, his crown. Their nobility takes him out of his time, and places him in a world of archaic magnificence - the realm of History. History is what distinguishes Rembrandt from his contemporaries. Near where this picture hangs, in Kenwood House, London, is a portrait by Frans Hals, which charmingly captures a moment of life. Rembrandt rejects that immediacy; even when he paints his own wife she is at once herself and the goddess Flora. Rembrandt's paintings enact a disturbance of time. He looks at us across the centuries because, set free from time, his paintings establish a space as open to us as to his contemporaries. In 1653 Rembrandt painted the philosopher Aristotle contemplating a bust of Homer. Aristotle in that painting is a worldly man; a gold chain is wrapped round his body. He looks miserable as he studies the bust of the blind, impoverished, itinerant bard - the artist. Better to be Homer than Aristotle, better to be an artist whose creation lives forever than a worldly success dragged down by gold chains. In his 1663 self-portrait, Rembrandt looks at us, and like Aristotle contemplating Homer, we are chastened. Inspirations and influences: Rembrandt's self-awareness as an artist owes something to Titian's Portrait of a Man (c 1512), purportedly of the poet Ariosto, which he saw in the house of an art collector in Amsterdam and emulated in his 1640 Self-portrait (both in the National Gallery). Where is it? The Iveagh Bequest, Kenwood House, London NW3 (020-8348 1286).",

It is because it delves into the dark stuff that I Am a Camera - an exhibition that includes not only photographs but some painting and sculpture - is the best that has been seen at his gallery for some time. </p> <p>I Am a Camera is an exploration of modern pain; the title is taken from Christopher Isherwood's account of the rise of Nazism, Goodbye to Berlin.

Cold, old and filthy rich, the people in her pictures wear diamonds against wrinkled skin, sit alone at banqueting tables. Faces are cropped out to alienate us from these people. And in case you didn't get the contrast, between Goldin and Craig-Martin stands a black cleaner taking a break from her work. </p> <p>That is, an eye-fooling, hyperreal sculpture of one.

The young London artist Jason Brooks shows cheap imitations of Chuck Close, and a young Los Angeles artist, Kristia Calabrese, exhibits paintings that are even worse.

The mournful quality of the photograph has been pointed out by many critics, and Saatchi seems to have been reading them. Or perhaps the photograph's morbid nature sits well with his own. This exhibition is predicated upon the photograph as simulacrum, upon art's deadly capacity to make a perfect replacement for real life. </p> <p>I Am a Camera lures us into a world where living faces are frozen. Hiroshi Sugimoto's portraits of Henry VIII and his wives are isolated in the sepulchral last room of the Saatchi Gallery, presented as if they were the final secret in the inner burial chamber of the pyramid. Sugimoto is professionally morbid. He takes pictures of waxwork dummies at Madame Tussaud's, shooting them in black and white with a flat light that fools you momentarily into thinking these are living subjects. By the time you register the corpse-like stillness of the faces, you are fatally confused about where life ends and what Edgar Allan Poe called \"the kingdom of the inorganic\" begins. </p> <p>A lot of this is cliche. Roland Barthes published his meditation on photography and death in 1980. Sugimoto's pictures, spooky as they are, risk being dead in the wrong way, dead as art. They are freakish, eccentric artefacts of the late-20th century. </p> <p>Where this exhibition goes beyond cliche is in bringing this art up against what it routinely excludes: the other horror, the invisible violence that you can find anywhere you look - real life. The Saatchi Gallery is an almost parodic instance of the gallery cut off from reality, a white space station orbiting around London. It makes me think of the millionaire's home in William Gibson's novel Neuromancer, where thousands of miles above the earth is an art collection including Duchamp's Large Glass. </p> <p>I Am a Camera contains documents of social worlds, presented as morbid simulacra of those worlds. Billingham's pictures of his father, mother and brother in their claustrophobic world, throwing cats, smoking fags, making each other cry, have been seen widely around the world, but perhaps never in a context that more painfully raises the question of their moral status. He took these pictures for whom? For Charles Saatchi, so he could amuse himself with the sight of a working class family gone to the dogs? </p> <p>I am a Camera is a far more successful attempt to put the facts of early 21st-century life in a gallery than any of the recent wave of self-proclaimed political art exhibitions, such as Protest and Survive at the Whitechapel. This is a queasy thought. Saatchi is obviously not a socialist, and whatever it is that lies behind this troubling collection of modern catastrophes, it is not rage. I Am a Camera is finally a snapshot of the futility of representation in a world of devastating ironies. The juxtapositions of low life and high life, a ball at the Waldorf Astoria with a junkie's bedroom on the Lower East Side, the royal visage of Henry VIII with the broken face of Richard Billingham's father Ray, are not furious but celebratory. </p> <p>This is where the morbid quality of it all becomes disturbing. These documents are not meant to make you act. You are not even meant to see them as documents, but as spectacular works of art, images to feast on, featuring real people.

      "body": "<p>As they set off from her apartment, Corinne asked for her money. Jean-Claude apologised for not having had the time to go to Geneva, but said he would go on Monday morning without fail. She was a little annoyed, but her excitement about the glittering dinner party that awaited them soon returned.</p> <p> They left the motorway at Fontainebleau, and from then on she gave him directions from a map on which he had marked with a cross, at random, the location of Kouchner\u00cds house. They were looking for \"a little road on the left\". After driving around in the forest for an hour, he stopped to look in the boot for a piece of paper on which he\u00cdd written Kouchner\u00cds phone number, but he didn\u00cdt find it. When Corinne began to worry about their being late, he reassured her: other guests who were also researchers were coming from Geneva and wouldn\u00cdt arrive before 10.30. </p> <p> Corinne was getting impatient. At around 10.30, he stopped again at a picnic area, determined to tear the boot apart until he found Kouchner\u00cds number. He returned, sheepishly saying that he hadn\u00cdt found the piece of paper. He had, however, found a necklace he\u00cdd been looking forward to giving her. Corinne shrugged: so what. But he insisted and finally persuaded her to wear it, at least for the evening. She got out of the car so that he could put it on her the way he\u00cdd always done with the jewellery he gave her, making her close her eyes. </p> <p> First she felt, on her face and neck, the burning foam of the tear gas spray. She half opened her eyes but closed them immediately because they stung even more, and as he continued to spray her she began to struggle. </p> <p> A hard cylindrical bar held against Corinne\u00cds stomach was giving her electric shocks: it was a stun wand. Convinced she was going to die, she screamed, \"I don\u00cdt want to! Don\u00cdt kill me! Think of L*a and Chlo* [her children]!\" and opened her eyes. </p> <p> Looking into his saved her life. All of a sudden, it was over. He was standing in front of her, speechless, distraught, holding out his hands. \"But Corinne,\" he kept saying softly, \"but Corinne... calm down...\"</p> <p> He made her sit in the car, where the two of them collected themselves as though they\u00cdd both just fought off an attack from someone else. They wiped their faces with paper towels and mineral water. After a moment, she asked if they were still going to Kouchner\u00cds for dinner; they decided not to. He drove back the way they had come. At the first village, he went to call Kouchner to say they weren\u00cdt coming, and she wasn\u00cdt even surprised that he now had the phone number. She stayed in the car; he had put the ignition key in his pocket. She watched him, beneath the neon lighting in the phone box, talking, or pretending to talk. When he returned, she asked him if he\u00cdd picked up the necklace and he replied no, but it wasn\u00cdt important \u0084 he\u00cdd kept the receipt. She realised that at no time had she seen this necklace, whereas she had seen, fallen among the dead leaves by the side of the car, a flexible plastic cord that seemed quite appropriate for strangling someone.</p> <p> During the entire trip back, which took more than two hours because he was driving very slowly, she was afraid that his murderous rage would flare up again. Now it was her turn to distract him. She spoke to him both as a devoted friend and as a professional psychologist. He blamed everything on his illness. This cancer wasn\u00cdt satisfied with killing him, it was driving him mad. He wept. He made her promise not to say a word to anyone, and she made him promise to return her money, all her money, by Monday. </p> <p> The sun was up when he arrived home. He did not go upstairs at all during the day that followed. He knew what he would see there. He had carefully pulled up the duvets, but he knew what was under them. At nightfall, he understood that the hour of death, so long postponed, had arrived. </p> <p> Shortly before 4am on Sunday morning, he started fires \u0084 first in the attic, next in the stairwell, finally in the children\u00cds room \u0084 and then entered his own bedroom. A surer method would have been to take the barbiturates in advance, but he ended up using a bottle of Nembutal he\u00cdd kept for 10 years in the back of the medicine cabinet. </p> <p> While street cleaners who had spotted the fire on the roof during their morning round were beginning to pound on the door downstairs, he swallowed 20 capsules. The electricity blew; smoke began to pour into the room. He tried to lie down next to Florence. But he couldn\u00cdt see well, his eyes were stinging, he hadn\u00cdt set their room alight yet, and the firefighters, whose siren he claims not to have heard, were already there. No longer able to breathe, he dragged himself to the window and opened it. They raised their ladder to rescue him. He lost consciousness. </p> <p> After he came out of his coma, psychiatrists were assigned to examine him. They were struck by the precision of his statements and his constant concern with making a favourable impression. He was surely also having trouble separating himself from the character he had played all those years because, in an effort to win people over, he still used the same techniques that had worked for Dr Romand: composure, a dignified gravity, an almost obsequious attention to the expectations of his interlocutor. During subsequent interviews, although they saw him sob and show emphatic signs of misery, they couldn\u00cdt say whether he was truly suffering or not. They had the uneasy sense of observing a robot deprived of all capacity to feel but programmed to analyse exterior stimuli and adapt its reactions accordingly. Used to functioning with the \"Dr Romand\" program, he had needed an adjustment period to set up a new program, \"Romand the murderer\", and learn how to run it. </p> <p>\"He will never, ever, manage to be perceived as authentic,\" the report concludes, \"and he himself fears that he will never know if he is.\" The last words in a French trial, before the court retires to deliberate, belong to the accused. Romand had obviously prepared his text and he read it without any mistakes, in a voice that sometimes broke with emotion: \"It\u00cds true that silence must be my lot. </p> <p> \"I understand that my words and even my still being alive make the scandal of my actions worse. I wished to take upon myself both judgment and punishment, and I believe that this is the last time I will be able to speak to those who suffer because of me. I know that my words are pathetically inadequate, but I must speak. I must tell them their anguish is with me day and night. I know they refuse to forgive me, but in memory of Florence I want to ask their forgiveness. It will perhaps come to me only after my death. I want to tell Florence\u00cds mother and brothers that her father died as a result of his fall. I don\u00cdt ask them to believe me, because I have no proof, but I say it before Florence and before God because I know that an unconfessed crime will not be forgiven. I ask them all to forgive me. </p> <p> \"Now it is to you, my Flo, to you, my Caro, my Titou, my Papa, my Mama, that I would like to speak. You are here in my heart and it is this invisible presence that gives me the strength to speak to you. You know everything, and if anyone can forgive me, it is you. I ask your forgiveness. Forgiveness for having destroyed your lives, forgiveness for having never told the truth. And yet, my Flo, I am sure that with your intelligence, your goodness, your mercy, you could have found it in your heart to pardon me. Forgive me for not having been able to bear the thought of causing you pain. I knew that I couldn\u00cdt live without you, but I am still alive today and I promise you I will try to live as long as God wishes me to, unless those who suffer because of me ask me to die to relieve their torment. I know that you will help me to find the path of truth, of life. There was a great, great deal of love between us. I will still love you in truth. I ask forgiveness of those who can forgive. I ask forgiveness as well of those who can never forgive. Thank you, Your Honour.\"</p> <p>After five hours of deliberation, Jean-Claude Romand was condemned to life imprisonment, with no possibility of parole for 22 years.

Used to functioning with the \"Dr Romand\" program, he had needed an adjustment period to set up a new program, \"Romand the murderer\", and learn how to run it. \"He will never, ever, manage to be perceived as authentic,\" the report concludes, \"and he himself fears that he will never know if he is.\" The last words in a French trial, before the court retires to deliberate, belong to the accused. Romand had obviously prepared his text and he read it without any mistakes, in a voice that sometimes broke with emotion: \"It\u00cds true that silence must be my lot. \"I understand that my words and even my still being alive make the scandal of my actions worse. I wished to take upon myself both judgment and punishment, and I believe that this is the last time I will be able to speak to those who suffer because of me. I know that my words are pathetically inadequate, but I must speak. I must tell them their anguish is with me day and night. I know they refuse to forgive me, but in memory of Florence I want to ask their forgiveness. It will perhaps come to me only after my death. I want to tell Florence\u00cds mother and brothers that her father died as a result of his fall. I don\u00cdt ask them to believe me, because I have no proof, but I say it before Florence and before God because I know that an unconfessed crime will not be forgiven. I ask them all to forgive me. \"Now it is to you, my Flo, to you, my Caro, my Titou, my Papa, my Mama, that I would like to speak. You are here in my heart and it is this invisible presence that gives me the strength to speak to you. You know everything, and if anyone can forgive me, it is you. I ask your forgiveness. Forgiveness for having destroyed your lives, forgiveness for having never told the truth. And yet, my Flo, I am sure that with your intelligence, your goodness, your mercy, you could have found it in your heart to pardon me. Forgive me for not having been able to bear the thought of causing you pain. I knew that I couldn\u00cdt live without you, but I am still alive today and I promise you I will try to live as long as God wishes me to, unless those who suffer because of me ask me to die to relieve their torment. I know that you will help me to find the path of truth, of life. There was a great, great deal of love between us. I will still love you in truth. I ask forgiveness of those who can forgive. I ask forgiveness as well of those who can never forgive.

Jean-Claude apologised for not having had the time to go to Geneva, but said he would go on Monday morning without fail. She was a little annoyed, but her excitement about the glittering dinner party that awaited them soon returned.</p> <p>They left the motorway at Fontainebleau, and from then on she gave him directions from a map on which he had marked with a cross, at random, the location of Kouchner\u00d5s house. They were looking for \"a little road on the left\". After driving around in the forest for an hour, he stopped to look in the boot for a piece of paper on which he\u00d5d written Kouchner\u00d5s phone number, but he didn\u00d5t find it. When Corinne began to worry about their being late, he reassured her: other guests who were also researchers were coming from Geneva and wouldn\u00d5t arrive before 10.30.</p> <p>Corinne was getting impatient. At around 10.30, he stopped again at a picnic area, determined to tear the boot apart until he found Kouchner\u00d5s number. He returned, sheepishly saying that he hadn\u00d5t found the piece of paper. He had, however, found a necklace he\u00d5d been looking forward to giving her. Corinne shrugged: so what. But he insisted and finally persuaded her to wear it, at least for the evening. She got out of the car so that he could put it on her the way he\u00d5d always done with the jewellery he gave her, making her close her eyes.</p> <p>First she felt, on her face and neck, the burning foam of the tear gas spray. She half opened her eyes but closed them immediately because they stung even more, and as he continued to spray her she began to struggle.</p> <p>A hard cylindrical bar held against Corinne\u00d5s stomach was giving her electric shocks: it was a stun wand. Convinced she was going to die, she screamed, \"I don\u00d5t want to! Don\u00d5t kill me! Think of L\u008ea and Chlo\u008e [her children]!\" and opened her eyes.</p> <p>Looking into his saved her life. All of a sudden, it was over. He was standing in front of her, speechless, distraught, holding out his hands. \"But Corinne,\" he kept saying softly, \"but Corinne... calm down...\"</p> <p>He made her sit in the car, where the two of them collected themselves as though they\u00d5d both just fought off an attack from someone else. They wiped their faces with paper towels and mineral water. After a moment, she asked if they were still going to Kouchner\u00d5s for dinner; they decided not to. He drove back the way they had come. At the first village, he went to call Kouchner to say they weren\u00d5t coming, and she wasn\u00d5t even surprised that he now had the phone number. She stayed in the car; he had put the ignition key in his pocket. She watched him, beneath the neon lighting in the phone box, talking, or pretending to talk. When he returned, she asked him if he\u00d5d picked up the necklace and he replied no, but it wasn\u00d5t important \u00d1 he\u00d5d kept the receipt. She realised that at no time had she seen this necklace, whereas she had seen, fallen among the dead leaves by the side of the car, a flexible plastic cord that seemed quite appropriate for strangling someone.</p> <p>During the entire trip back, which took more than two hours because he was driving very slowly, she was afraid that his murderous rage would flare up again. Now it was her turn to distract him. She spoke to him both as a devoted friend and as a professional psychologist. He blamed everything on his illness. This cancer wasn\u00d5t satisfied with killing him, it was driving him mad. He wept. He made her promise not to say a word to anyone, and she made him promise to return her money, all her money, by Monday.</p> <p>The sun was up when he arrived home. He did not go upstairs at all during the day that followed. He knew what he would see there. He had carefully pulled up the duvets, but he knew what was under them. At nightfall, he understood that the hour of death, so long postponed, had arrived.</p> <p>Shortly before 4am on Sunday morning, he started fires \u00d1 first in the attic, next in the stairwell, finally in the children\u00d5s room \u00d1 and then entered his own bedroom. A surer method would have been to take the barbiturates in advance, but he ended up using a bottle of Nembutal he\u00d5d kept for 10 years in the back of the medicine cabinet.</p> <p>While street cleaners who had spotted the fire on the roof during their morning round were beginning to pound on the door downstairs, he swallowed 20 capsules. The electricity blew; smoke began to pour into the room. He tried to lie down next to Florence. But he couldn\u00d5t see well, his eyes were stinging, he hadn\u00d5t set their room alight yet, and the firefighters, whose siren he claims not to have heard, were already there. No longer able to breathe, he dragged himself to the window and opened it. They raised their ladder to rescue him. He lost consciousness.</p> <p>After he came out of his coma, psychiatrists were assigned to examine him. They were struck by the precision of his statements and his constant concern with making a favourable impression. He was surely also having trouble separating himself from the character he had played all those years because, in an effort to win people over, he still used the same techniques that had worked for Dr Romand: composure, a dignified gravity, an almost obsequious attention to the expectations of his interlocutor.

      "body": "<p>Microsoft may be doomed to lose even if it ultimately wins in the courts, for the anti-trust case may rob the company of the drive and the passion that have contributed to its extraordinary success. </p> <p>The more Microsoft doesn't change, the more intense the cries for them to change become. The contradiction was not lost on senior vice-president Dick Brass: \"The irony of this case is that the more we compete, the better for consumers. Yet the more we compete, the more we're attacked as ruthless. So you hurt the company if we're criticised, and you hurt the company if we don't compete.\" </p> <p>Government is now in Microsoft's rearview mirror. In the fall of 1998, a Clinton communications-policy strategist told me that government had already concluded the company had too much power, and thus Microsoft's future freedom to act would be thwarted. </p> <p>\"Microsoft has already lost this issue, and that's the biggest loss they've suffered. This case was supposedly about the browser. That's already happened. That's history. What Microsoft did to WordPerfect was what it desires to do with Windows 2000. They want to use it to control the house, to leverage itself into other markets, to control the entire information age.\" </p> <p>Following Microsoft are the more than 3m documents the Justice Department collected for the anti-trust trial. Those documents might be used against Microsoft in future lawsuits. Once judged guilty, a lower burden of proof is required in subsequent trials. As David Boies, the government's trial lawyer, observed: \"In this trial [Microsoft] started from a presumption of innocence and were not able to prevail. Now in these private cases they start from a presumption of guilt.\" </p> <p>Armed with a federal court ruling, 129 lawsuits in 26 states and the District of Columbia were pending in October 2000. And in each such lawsuit, victors are usually entitled to triple damages. Defending against lawsuits is not an incidental expense. A senior Microsoft official estimated that the legal cost to defend Microsoft in Judge Jackson's courtroom alone could reach $100m. </p> <p>But now that Jackson had ruled, unless Microsoft is exonerated of all charges, the company will be compelled to sign a consent decree, stationing the government over its shoulder, perhaps to wonder why voice recognition, or Media Player, is going to be bundled in with Windows. </p> <p><strong> Escape daily scrutiny</strong><br> </p> <p> The Justice Department has placed Microsoft on notice. Microsoft executives will constantly live in fear of subpoenas. And while they wait for a final ruling from the Supreme Court, which could take years, they may come to second-guess themselves, to be less combative. </p> <p>John Malone, whose Liberty Media partners Microsoft around the world, described Gates in late 1999 as depressed. \"He no longer looks forward to coming to the office.\" A reason Malone sold his cable company - aside from a desire to make a pile of money - was that he wanted to escape daily government scrutiny, which comes with any utility-like company. </p> <p>\"It will become clear to Bill that he can't win,\" Malone predicted. \"It's the Lilliputians...This is about Bill Gates growing up and realising that, even for Bill Gates, government\" is bigger. </p> <p>A year later, he concluded that Microsoft would never fully recover from this lawsuit. \"They're in the barrel,\" Malone explained. \"There's going to be a pile of civil lawsuits. Now, if you're Bill and his guys, you're all the time on defence, all the time giving depositions. You're just harassed to death. Your stock is in a funk. It's not so much that the world thinks you're the bad guys; it's that the perception is that government regulators [around the world] will hold up any deal.\" Executives will say: \"'If I do a deal with Microsoft it will take me two years to get it through regulators.'... Whether they win or lose on appeal, this is a setback.\" </p> <p>By mid-2000, the European Commission had launched investigations of Microsoft's practices on five different fronts, including whether it threatened to monopolise cable television in England, its pricing of Windows in France, and its efforts to leverage the Windows PC to gain power over servers. In China, the government declared that no foreign company should monopolise software and perhaps breach China's security. Henceforth, the government decreed, it would spurn Windows and instead back Linux as the operating system for China's computers. </p> <p>Inevitably, CEOs may make the choice John Malone said Rupert Murdoch did in April 2000. \"Rupert wanted Microsoft to be the technology supplier for his satellite platforms around the world,\" Malone, who is News Corporation's largest outside shareholder, said. </p> <p>\"Yet in the end he decided he's better off with Nokia than Microsoft because Microsoft would bring controversy and introduce politics, and government would drag it along slowly, while Nokia is clean. It's very discouraging. If you're working at Microsoft you know you made the best bid, yet you lost it. It's extremely depressing to their enthusiasm.\" </p> <p>Bill Gates is not blind to the trial's toll on his company. He told me before the verdict, \"no matter what the outcome, the lawsuit is a bad thing. The costs to the company and the taxpayers have been huge. The last thing any company wants is to be sued by the government\". </p> <p>Before Greg Maffei stepped down in late 1999 as the senior vice-president and chief deal maker for Microsoft, he said, \"maybe, subconsciously, we shied away from things\". </p> <p>Perhaps it is no accident that after investing in or acquiring a total of 25 companies in the first four months of 2000, since Judge Jackson's remedy verdict in early June this pace slowed dramatically, and Microsoft invested in just 16 companies over the next four months. </p> <p>Microsoft loses in various other ways. They have suffered a serious brain drain. From 1999 through the autumn of 2000, for example, an army of top Microsoft executives left the company to pursue other interests, including chief technology officer Nathan Myhrvold, group vice-president Paul Maritz, and the chief deal-maker Greg Maffei. </p> <p><strong> 'Sword of Damocles'</strong><br> </p> <p> And as a legal cloud hovers above Microsoft and it becomes a less cool place to work, it becomes harder to recruit the best and brightest. And it becomes more expensive. An employee who might have been happy to receive 50,000 share options, observed one former senior Microsoft executive, now wants 200,000.

An arrogance which derives from power and unalloyed success, with no leavening hard experience, no reverses.\" Bill Gates, he implied, was not an adult. </p> <p>Even if Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer and Microsoft appear more grown-up, it is probably too late. Microsoft has been too consistently careless, offended too many with their brusque behaviour, denied too much.

      "bodyText": "Microsoft may be doomed to lose even if it ultimately wins in the courts, for the anti-trust case may rob the company of the drive and the passion that have contributed to its extraordinary success. The more Microsoft doesn't change, the more intense the cries for them to change become. The contradiction was not lost on senior vice-president Dick Brass: \"The irony of this case is that the more we compete, the better for consumers. Yet the more we compete, the more we're attacked as ruthless. So you hurt the company if we're criticised, and you hurt the company if we don't compete.\" Government is now in Microsoft's rearview mirror. In the fall of 1998, a Clinton communications-policy strategist told me that government had already concluded the company had too much power, and thus Microsoft's future freedom to act would be thwarted. \"Microsoft has already lost this issue, and that's the biggest loss they've suffered. This case was supposedly about the browser. That's already happened. That's history. What Microsoft did to WordPerfect was what it desires to do with Windows 2000. They want to use it to control the house, to leverage itself into other markets, to control the entire information age.\" Following Microsoft are the more than 3m documents the Justice Department collected for the anti-trust trial. Those documents might be used against Microsoft in future lawsuits. Once judged guilty, a lower burden of proof is required in subsequent trials. As David Boies, the government's trial lawyer, observed: \"In this trial [Microsoft] started from a presumption of innocence and were not able to prevail. Now in these private cases they start from a presumption of guilt.\" Armed with a federal court ruling, 129 lawsuits in 26 states and the District of Columbia were pending in October 2000. And in each such lawsuit, victors are usually entitled to triple damages. Defending against lawsuits is not an incidental expense. A senior Microsoft official estimated that the legal cost to defend Microsoft in Judge Jackson's courtroom alone could reach $100m. But now that Jackson had ruled, unless Microsoft is exonerated of all charges, the company will be compelled to sign a consent decree, stationing the government over its shoulder, perhaps to wonder why voice recognition, or Media Player, is going to be bundled in with Windows. Escape daily scrutiny The Justice Department has placed Microsoft on notice. Microsoft executives will constantly live in fear of subpoenas. And while they wait for a final ruling from the Supreme Court, which could take years, they may come to second-guess themselves, to be less combative. John Malone, whose Liberty Media partners Microsoft around the world, described Gates in late 1999 as depressed. \"He no longer looks forward to coming to the office.\" A reason Malone sold his cable company - aside from a desire to make a pile of money - was that he wanted to escape daily government scrutiny, which comes with any utility-like company. \"It will become clear to Bill that he can't win,\" Malone predicted. \"It's the Lilliputians...This is about Bill Gates growing up and realising that, even for Bill Gates, government\" is bigger. A year later, he concluded that Microsoft would never fully recover from this lawsuit. \"They're in the barrel,\" Malone explained. \"There's going to be a pile of civil lawsuits. Now, if you're Bill and his guys, you're all the time on defence, all the time giving depositions. You're just harassed to death. Your stock is in a funk. It's not so much that the world thinks you're the bad guys; it's that the perception is that government regulators [around the world] will hold up any deal.\" Executives will say: \"'If I do a deal with Microsoft it will take me two years to get it through regulators.'... Whether they win or lose on appeal, this is a setback.\" By mid-2000, the European Commission had launched investigations of Microsoft's practices on five different fronts, including whether it threatened to monopolise cable television in England, its pricing of Windows in France, and its efforts to leverage the Windows PC to gain power over servers. In China, the government declared that no foreign company should monopolise software and perhaps breach China's security. Henceforth, the government decreed, it would spurn Windows and instead back Linux as the operating system for China's computers. Inevitably, CEOs may make the choice John Malone said Rupert Murdoch did in April 2000. \"Rupert wanted Microsoft to be the technology supplier for his satellite platforms around the world,\" Malone, who is News Corporation's largest outside shareholder, said. \"Yet in the end he decided he's better off with Nokia than Microsoft because Microsoft would bring controversy and introduce politics, and government would drag it along slowly, while Nokia is clean. It's very discouraging. If you're working at Microsoft you know you made the best bid, yet you lost it. It's extremely depressing to their enthusiasm.\" Bill Gates is not blind to the trial's toll on his company. He told me before the verdict, \"no matter what the outcome, the lawsuit is a bad thing. The costs to the company and the taxpayers have been huge. The last thing any company wants is to be sued by the government\". Before Greg Maffei stepped down in late 1999 as the senior vice-president and chief deal maker for Microsoft, he said, \"maybe, subconsciously, we shied away from things\". Perhaps it is no accident that after investing in or acquiring a total of 25 companies in the first four months of 2000, since Judge Jackson's remedy verdict in early June this pace slowed dramatically, and Microsoft invested in just 16 companies over the next four months. Microsoft loses in various other ways. They have suffered a serious brain drain. From 1999 through the autumn of 2000, for example, an army of top Microsoft executives left the company to pursue other interests, including chief technology officer Nathan Myhrvold, group vice-president Paul Maritz, and the chief deal-maker Greg Maffei. 'Sword of Damocles' And as a legal cloud hovers above Microsoft and it becomes a less cool place to work, it becomes harder to recruit the best and brightest. And it becomes more expensive. An employee who might have been happy to receive 50,000 share options, observed one former senior Microsoft executive, now wants 200,000. In April, when the share price dropped to $66.83 and made the higher-priced shares granted executives in the prior year worthless, Microsoft offered 70m new option shares to employees at that relatively low $66.83 purchase price. When Microsoft filed papers in May opposing a breakup, it warned that having this \"Sword of Damocles\" dangling over its head would prompt \"irreplaceable employees\" to flee. One sees Microsoft slippage when Case outdraws Gates in Davos; when such stalwart Microsoft allies as Dell, Compaq and Intel in January 2000 invested $57m in TurboLinux, a company pushing Linux worldwide; when four members of the original team that created the Apple Macintosh form a company called Eazel to improve Linux so it can compete head-to-head on the desktop with Windows; when America Online strengthens AOLTV by investing $200m in TiVo, building into its set-top boxes such features as storing, pausing, rewinding, and replaying. Observed former Microsoft manager Rob Glaser, \"because of this switch to the internet and because of the anti-trust trial, the aura of Microsoft as omnipotent has been shattered. This is no longer the Pax Microsoft era\". In addition, the stock market seems to have punished Microsoft. Although the value of Microsoft's stock doubled between October 1997, when Justice first sued the company for violating the consent decree, and April 2000, the stock did plunge 43% between January 1 and April 25 2000. After the verdict, the stock and those of other hi-tech and dot.com companies seemed to enter a free fall. Microsoft's legal woes are blamed for helping unsettle the market. By late October 2000, Microsoft's stock price was stuck at around $60 per share, having lost one half of its value in just nine months. If the stock continues to lag, it might intensify pressures on Gates to drop his appeal, assuming that Justice and the states would agree and would bar evidence gathered in this trial from being used in civil lawsuits. To insist on fighting the lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court, it will be said, will harm Microsoft shareholders, setting up a clash between two of Gates's core beliefs: his conviction that Microsoft is right and his awareness of his fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. For Microsoft, hindsight can lead only to regret.

But it is not a sentiment, given my experience of learning to get down a mountain with my feet strapped to a large, waxed board, with which I can easily concur. </p> <p>A couple of years ago, I took a few days of informal snowboarding lessons. By the end of the course, I could just about get down a mountain, though not very prettily. Over the following two unusually-mild Scottish winters, I tried to improve my skills by taking two trips with more experienced snowboarding friends to Glencoe and the Nevis range. The results were not encouraging. </p> <p>As my knees juddered on the ice and my ribs bruised as they fell on the occasional jutting rock, friends told me just to \"feel it\".

The first powder of the season has fallen deeply on the Coastal Mountains and it is immediately apparent that getting better at snowboarding is going to be a far less painful experience here. And cheaper one, too. </p> <p>The strength of the pound against the Canadian dollar makes snowboarding lessons here good value for money. The Ride Esprit programme at Whistler and Blackcomb costs $289 (\u00a3137) for a four-day improvement course; or $269 (\u00a3128) for a three-day beginner's course, including rentals and lift passes. For women wanting to avoid male competitiveness, there are also two-day, all-women camps for $199 (\u00a394). </p> <p>Snowboarders have a reputation for cooler-than-thou arrogance, but the first day of my course made it clear this was not going to be an intimidating experience. Jeremy Taylor began by improving our turning technique. Relaxing the knees more; sitting down on a turn, standing up as you leave it; hip-positioning technique explained by reference to defecation and copulation. It was basic stuff, but by the end of the first day confidence - and technique - had improved immensely. </p> <p>Then came the apr\u00e8s-ski. The big advantage of taking a few snowboarding lessons if you're not part of a large group is that it offers the opportunity to make instant friends. Whistler is still probably the coolest snowboarding resort in North America, but the nightlife, though enthusiastic, doesn't reach European standards of sophistication. </p> <p>With my newly-acquired friends, I try the bars and clubs. The bars are fine, but the later-opening bars-cum-clubs don't quite pass. The three main spots in town are Garfinkels (music policy akin to a school disco); Buffalo Bills (music for thirtysomethings with too much money and too little taste); and Maxx Fish (the nearest you'll get to a European club). Kicking out time, at around 2am, is also painfully early. </p> <p>The second day of the programme involves more difficult terrain, with video analysis for those brave enough to see just how poor their technique really is.

After a massage, and a hearty meal, it is time for bed. </p> <p>Overnight, 30cm of snow falls. In the morning it's still coming thick and heavy. Many of the lifts have been closed by the high winds. Going up Blackcomb means steep runs in poor visibility all the way back down. A week ago, I would never have attempted it. Emboldened by the lessons, I decide to give it a go. </p> <p>Halfway down, I realise I'm partially lost and fully terrified.

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong's second most senior official, Anson Chan, who was first appointed under British rule, has resigned unexpectedly for \"personal reasons\" only months after receiving a public rebuke from Beijing. Ms Chan admitted yesterday to having \"different opinions\" from the chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, who has been backed vigorously by the Chinese leadership. She said she accepted \"that it is Mr Tung who has the final decision\". Since the 1997 handover, Ms Chan has walked a tightrope to retain the confidence of Beijing while quietly seeking to head off possible encroachments on Hong Kong's autonomy. She was widely seen abroad as a symbol of continuity. Ms Chan's departure \"to spend more time\" with her family is welcomed by supporters of the mainland government who have conducted a whispering campaign against her alleged lack of loyalty. \"Now she cannot work with him anymore and wants to leave,\" said Xu Si-min, a Hong Kong delegate to a top Chinese consultative body. \"From my point of view, I am very happy.\" Other Hong Kongers said they regretted the sudden departure of a popular official who \"would not go to the extreme\" and commanded confidence abroad. Mr Tung praised Ms Chan's 38 years of public service at a news conference yesterday but a statement from Beijing avoided comment on her performance. She had previously said she would continue as Hong Kong's chief secretary until June 2002, shortly before the next chief executive is chosen. Ms Chan has spoken in favour of academic freedom and more democracy for Hong Kong in terms which, although coded, differed significantly from those used by the cautious Mr Tung. Earlier this year, as dissatisfaction with Mr Tung's performance mounted in Hong Kong, Ms Chan's position became harder to maintain. Local Beijing officials and business tycoons spread the untrue tale that she was involved in a conspiracy to discredit her boss. Until recently, she still seemed tempted by the idea of standing as the next chief executive, to be picked by a largely pro-Beijing 800-strong election committee. In September, on a visit to Beijing to report to the mainland leaders, Ms Chan was publicly rapped over the knuckles by the Chinese vice-premier, Qian Qichen. Mr Qian said he hoped she and the civil service for which she is responsible would \"better support the work of the chief executive\". Another senior Chinese official is said to have spoken to her even more bluntly in private. But opinion polls have consistently shown Ms Chan is far more popular in Hong Kong than Mr Tung. \"Ms Chan is the most popular civil servant with the people of Hong Kong,\" said a leading Hong Kong democrat, Yeung Sam. \"They have confidence in the civil service because of her.\" Ms Chan first created a stir when she was appointed by the last British governor, Chris Patten, as chief secretary in 1993. She represented a much-valued continuity in Hong Kong as Mr Patten gave way in 1997 to the handpicked Mr Tung. Mr Tung was apparently instructed by Beijing in 1999 to put aside personal differences with Ms Chan to present a united front. But their difficulties came to a head last September after Mr Tung's special assistant, Andrew Lo, was accused of exerting pressure on an independent pollster. Ms Chan is said to have suggested that Mr Lo should be removed. Before Hong Kong's return to China, Ms Chan believed she was able to communicate effectively with Beijing in spite of her long association with the colonial regime. Political observers in Hong Kong yesterday concluded that Ms Chan had finally realised this was an unrealistic dream and wished to make a clean departure. In doing so, she may help the chances of the financial secretary, Donald Tsang, whom she would personally favour as her successor. Mr Tsang has been able to keep a lower profile in his current position, but is seen as a reassuring figure to the outside world.",

      "body": "<p>Luc Ladmiral was awakened shortly after 4am on the morning of Monday, January 11, 1993, by a telephone call. His friends the Romands' house was on fire; he should come. When Luc arrived, the firefighters were bringing out the bodies. All his life he will remember the sealed grey plastic bags into which they had put the children: too horrible to look at. Florence, Mrs Romand, had simply been covered with a coat. Her face, blackened by the smoke, was unmarked. Smoothing her hair in a desolate gesture of farewell, Luc's fingers encountered something strange. He felt around, carefully tilting the young woman's head to one side, then called over a firefighter to show him, at the base of the skull, an open wound. It must have been from a beam that fell on her, the firefighter said; part of the attic had collapsed. Luc then clambered into the red vehicle where the rescuers had placed Jean-Claude, Florence's husband, the only one of the family who was still alive. His pulse was weak. He was in pyjamas, unconscious, burned yet already as cold as a corpse. </p> <p>Luc and Jean-Claude had been friends ever since medical school in Lyon. They'd got married almost at the same time; their children had grown up together. Each knew everything about the other's life - the public image, but also the secrets, the secrets of honest, reliable men who were all the more vulnerable to temptation. When Jean-Claude had confided in him about an affair, talked about chucking everything in, Luc had made him listen to reason. Their lives were very similar, even if they hadn't succeeded in the same way. Jean-Claude had become a leading figure in the world of medical research, hobnobbing with government ministers, always off at international conferences, while Luc was a GP in Ferney-Voltaire, a town on the French side of the Swiss border, just a few miles north of Geneva. The Romands lived in the nearby village of Pr\u00e9vessin. </p> <p>Later that Monday morning, Luc phoned the casualty department in Geneva: Jean-Claude, who was 38, had been placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber; the prognosis was guarded. Luc prayed with his wife C\u00e9cile and the children that he would never regain consciousness. </p> <p>When Luc went to his office, two policemen were waiting for him. Their questions seemed odd. They wanted to know if the Romands had any enemies, if they'd been involved in any suspicious activities... Seeing Luc's astonishment, the police told him the truth. An initial examination of the bodies revealed that the victims had died before the fire, Florence from head injuries inflicted by a blunt instrument, the children - five-year-old Antoine and seven-year-old Caroline - from bullet wounds. </p> <p>That wasn't all. In Clairvaux-les-Lacs, in the Jura Mountains some 50 miles to the north-west of Ferney, Jean-Claude's uncle had been delegated to break the tragic news to the injured man's parents, a frail elderly couple. Accompanied by their doctor, he had found the house locked, the dog mysteriously silent. Worried, the uncle had broken open the door to discover his brother, his sister-in-law and the dog lying in their own blood. They, too, had been shot. </p> <p>Murdered. The Romands had been murdered. The word echoed through Luc's brain, stunning him. \"Was it a robbery?\" he asked, as if that word might somehow reduce the horror. The officers asked again about possible enemies, and Luc, at a loss, shook his head. Enemies? The Romands? Everyone loved them. The police needed to find out exactly what Jean-Claude did for a living. A doctor, the neighbours had said, but he didn't have a surgery. Luc explained that he was a researcher at the World Health Organisation (WHO), in Geneva. One of the officers telephoned, asking to speak to someone who worked with Dr Romand. The receptionist did not know any Dr Romand. She connected the officer to the personnel director, who consulted his files and confirmed: there was no Dr Romand at WHO. </p> <p>In the course of that day, reality became even more nightmarish. Summoned to the police station in the afternoon, Luc learned that a note in Jean-Claude's handwriting confessing to the crimes had been found in his car and that everything people thought they knew about his career and professional activities was a sham. The WHO? No one there had ever heard of him. The national registry of physicians? He wasn't listed. The hospitals in Paris where he was said to be on the medical staff? He was not accredited there, nor was he a graduate of the medical school in Lyon where Luc himself, and several others, swore nevertheless to have been students with him. He had begun his studies, yes, but had stopped taking his exams at the end of the second year; from then on, it was all false. Latterly, Jean-Claude had confessed to Luc that he was suffering from cancer, for which he said he was being treated in Paris by the eminent oncologist L\u00e9on Schwartzenberg. Also false. Dr Schwartzenberg had no record of Jean-Claude Romand, nor had the oncology department of any other hospital in France. </p> <p>At first, Luc simply refused to believe this. When someone tells you that your best friend, your daughter's godfather, the most respectable man you know has killed his wife, his children, his parents, and that in addition he has been lying to you about everything for years, isn't it normal to go on believing in him, even in the face of overwhelming proof? </p> <p>It soon came out that Jean-Claude had an on-off relationship with a woman called Corinne Hourtin - a child psychologist, now divorced, who had once lived in Ferney with her husband R\u00e9mi. She had handed over to Jean-Claude 900,000 francs (about \u00a390,000) in savings that he was to have invested for her in Switzerland. He had embezzled it instead. Other revelations came from Florence's family, the Crolets. They, too, had entrusted money to Jean-Claude: first the father's retirement bonus, and then, after his death, a million francs netted from the sale of his house. Their grief was compounded by an agonising suspicion: M Crolet had died in a fall on a staircase when he was alone with Jean-Claude. Had he been yet another victim of his son-in-law? </p> <p>Everyone was wondering: how could we have lived beside this man for so long without suspecting a thing? Everyone tried to remember a moment when some suspicion had crossed their minds. Luc himself remembered that he'd been struck by something a few months earlier, after learning from Florence that Jean-Claude had ranked fifth in all of Paris in his finals. What astonished Luc wasn't this achievement but the fact that he hadn't learned of it at the time. Why hadn't Jean-Claude mentioned it? Questioned, accused of being secretive, Jean-Claude had shrugged, said he didn't want to make a big deal of it, and changed the subject. It was extraordinary, this ability to deflect conversation whenever it turned to him. Thinking back on it, you ended up admiring his discretion, his modesty, his desire to show others to advantage. Yet Luc had felt vaguely that there was something not quite right in what Jean-Claude said about his career. He'd considered calling WHO to discover exactly what it was he did there - but had decided the whole thing was absurd. And now he kept telling himself that if he'd gone through with it, maybe things would have turned out differently. </p> <p>\"Perhaps,\" said C\u00e9cile when he told her of his remorse, \"... perhaps he would have killed you as well.\" </p> <p>Three days after the fire, the Ladmirals learned that Jean-Claude was going to live. </p> <p> Jean-Claude Romand's early childhood was spent in a small village in the Jura where his father ran a farm. Neighbours, cousins, schoolteachers all remember a well-behaved little boy, quiet and sweet, whom some are tempted to describe as too well-behaved, too quiet, too sweet. An only child, perhaps somewhat overprotected by his mother. A child who never got up to any mischief, more respectable - if one can say that about a child - than truly lovable, but even so a child whom no one imagined to be unhappy. He says that his mother worried all the time and that he learned early on to mislead her so that she wouldn't worry even more. He admired his father for never showing his feelings and tried to imitate him. It was better to conceal them. On the one hand, he had been taught not to lie, and that was absolute dogma: a Romand was as good as his word, a Romand told the truth and shamed the Devil. On the other hand, there were certain things you shouldn't say, even if they were true. You had to avoid upsetting anyone, or boasting about your success or your good qualities. </p> <p> Romand achieves good grades at school. He originally plans to become a forester, but then changes his mind and decides to study medicine instead at Lyon. At the end of his second year, in 1975, he needs to resit one exam. He fails to turn up, but he tells no one, and no one notices. </p> <p>Three weeks went by between the day of the examination and the posting of the results. There was still time for him to admit that he had lied. It would have been hard for him, naturally. To this serious young man, it must have seemed impossibly painful to admit a whopping error, a childish blunder like that of Antoine Doinel in Les Quatre-Cent Coups, who extricates himself from a sticky situation at school by blurting out that his mother has just died, and who then must deal with the inevitable consequences of his lies and the certainty that the truth will come out. The most baffling thing, in Romand's case, is that he committed his folly in two stages, like the computer user who, having accidentally typed the command for erasing a valuable file, when asked by the program whether he's sure he wants to delete the file, carefully considers the pros and cons - then goes ahead and destroys it anyway. Rationally speaking, anything would have been better than what Jean-Claude did: he waited for the day the results were posted and then announced that he had passed, that he'd been accepted as a third-year medical student. </p> <p>How could he have foreseen that there was something worse than being quickly unmasked, which was not to be unmasked; how could he have suspected that this childish lie would lead him 18 years later to murder his parents, Florence, and the children he did not yet have? </p> <p> While still ostensibly studying medicine, Jean-Claude marries Florence Crolet, a fellow student at Lyon. He supposedly passes his medical board exam and becomes first a research assistant in a medical research institution and then a research scientist at the World Health Organisation in Geneva. </p> <p>Romand was always, as Florence put it, \"very compartmentalised\", strictly separating his personal and professional relations, never inviting colleagues from WHO to his house, refusing to allow himself to be disturbed at home by anyone from his office, or at work by any of his family or friends. Moreover, nobody had his office phone number, not even his wife, who contacted him through an answering service: you left a message in a voice mailbox, which sent him a signal on the bleeper he always carried with him, and then he quickly called back. Neither his wife nor anyone else found the arrangement strange. It was one of his personality traits, like his gruffness, which she often joked about: \"One of these days, I'm going to find out my husband's a communist spy.\" </p> <p>In the mornings, he was the one who drove the children to the Ecole Saint-Vincent. He would accompany them into the courtyard, exchange a few words with the teachers or the pupils' mothers, then drive off towards Geneva. More often than not he ended up in the car park of WHO. Entering with a visitor's badge, carrying a briefcase, he followed a familiar orbit, going from the ground-floor library to the conference rooms and the publications office, where he systematically swept up anything printed and free: his house and car overflowed with papers bearing the letterhead or stamp of WHO. He used all the services offered by the organisation - a post office where he sent his mail, a bank where he made most of his withdrawals, a travel agency through which he planned the family holidays - but did not risk going upstairs, where security guards might have asked him what he was looking for. His mother-in-law remembers that one Sunday when the whole family had gone to Switzerland, the children had wanted to see Papa's office, so Papa had agreed to the detour. They'd pulled into the car park, he'd pointed out the window. And that's all. </p> <p>At first he went to WHO every day, later less regularly. He'd stop at a news-stand to buy an armful of papers: dailies, magazines, scientific journals. Then he'd go and read them, either in a cafe - he was careful to change cafes often and to choose them far enough from home - or in his car. He would park in a car park or at a service station and stay there for hours, reading, taking notes, dozing. He'd have a sandwich for lunch and continue reading throughout the afternoon in a different cafe, at a different service station. Other days, he needed open air and nature, and would drive into the Jura Mountains. </p> <p>Lastly, there were the trips - conferences, seminars, symposiums, all over the world. He would buy a guide to the country; Florence would pack his suitcase. He'd drive off in his car, which he would supposedly leave in the long-term car park at Geneva airport. In a comfortable hotel room, often near the airport, he would take off his shoes, stretch out on the bed, spend three or four days watching television and the planes taking off and landing outside his window. He studied the guide books so he wouldn't make any mistakes in his stories when he got home. He telephoned his family every day to tell them what time it was and what the weather was like in Sao Paulo or Tokyo. He'd tell his wife, his children, his parents that he missed them, was thinking of them, sent them a big kiss. After a few days, he went home with presents bought in an airport gift shop. Everyone made a fuss of him. He was tired from jet lag. </p> <p>Indirectly it was WHO that provided Jean-Claude with a source of income. He said or let it be understood that as an international civil servant he was in a position to make extremely advantageous investments at a rate of 18%, an opportunity he could share with his family. Jean-Claude's parents were not the kind of people to cheat on their taxes by putting their savings into Swiss banks, but as it was their son's idea that was enough for them. Romand lived on their nest egg at the beginning of his marriage. Florence declared to the income tax authorities the very modest salary she earned by temporarily filling in for pharmacists in the area, and he declared no income because, since he worked in Switzerland, he had - he said - no taxes to pay. </p> <p>The year Antoine was born, Florence's father retired from his job in Annecy. A disguised redundancy, his retirement brought him a bonus of 400,000 francs. Jean-Claude agreed to do his father-in-law a favour by investing 378,000 francs for him at a Geneva bank. This sum was deposited in an account in Jean-Claude's name, since he was the one whose position entitled him to make such an investment. But one day Jean-Claude's father-in-law told him he wanted to withdraw part of his capital to buy a Mercedes. A few weeks later, on October 23, 1988, Pierre Crolet fell on the stairs of his home where he was alone with his son-in-law and died just before the arrival of the paramedics. </p> <p>After the fire, a new investigation was ordered at the request of the Crolet family. Of course, it uncovered nothing. At the end of the proceedings, Jean-Claude insisted on telling the Crolet family, as God was his witness, that he had had no hand in his father-in-law's death. Short of a confession on his part some day, we will never learn any more. </p> <p>What is indisputable is that the death of his father-in-law was providential for Romand. There was no longer any question of touching the money in the Swiss account. Then Mme Crolet decided to sell the house, now too large for her on her own, and handed over to her son-in-law the proceeds of the sale, which amounted to 1.3million francs. </p> <p> Romand had become enraptured with Corinne Hourtin and they begin an affair when she moves to Paris. But she soon decides that she could never love him. He confides in her, as he he did to Luc Ladmiral, that he is suffering from cancer. They remain friends, and she turns to him when she had money to invest, handing over 900,000 francs in cash. He flies from Paris with a small suitcase stuffed with notes. Soon after, Corinne decides she wants some of her money back, but finds Romand evasive. </p> <p>Just before the 1992 Christmas holidays, the president of the school board wanted to talk to Jean-Claude on the subject of a demoted head. The president did not know Jean-Claude well enough to be aware that one didn't call him at his office, and he had his secretary look up Jean-Claude's number in the WHO directory. Puzzled at not finding him anywhere, he imagined there must be some explanation, and he didn't think about it again until one day after the holiday when he ran into Florence in the main street of Ferney and told her about it. His tone wasn't that of a man who had suspicions but that of someone who was curious to find out the real story behind an odd mystery, and Florence reacted equally mildly. It was strange, yes, there was obviously a reason, and she'd speak to her husband about it. Florence and the man did not see each other again. One week later she was dead, and no one will ever know if she brought it up with Jean-Claude. He says she didn't. </p> <p>Although he was unsure where the first blow would come from, he knew that the hounds were closing in. His various bank accounts would soon be overdrawn, and he had no means of replenishing them. People were talking about him, and talking about coming after him. Hands were flipping through directories. The look in Florence's eyes had changed. He was scared. </p> <p>In the run-up to Christmas, he flew to Paris and took Corinne to dinner at the Restaurant Michel Rostang. Corinne told him that she had made up her mind and she wanted all of her money back. Instead of trying to wriggle out of it, he opened his diary to set up a meeting when he would hand over the funds. Turning the pages, he had an idea: he had agreed to have dinner at the start of the new year with his friend Bernard Kouchner, illustrious co-founder of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. Would Corinne like to join them? Of course Corinne would like that. Before then, though, he would be dead. </p> <p>On the flight home, he continued to study his diary. Christmas wasn't a good day, that would be too cruel for the children. Caroline was going to play Mary and Antoine one of the shepherds in the Nativity play at the church. So, right after New Year? </p> <p> Jean-Claude did not go to work on the Tuesday after the New Year. Florence and he ran errands in Ferney. She insisted that he buy a new suit; he let himself be tempted by a parka for 3,200 francs. The saleswoman thought they seemed a couple who were at leisure, well-off, and getting along fine. </p> <p>Jean-Claude had spent the morning studying books such as the Vidal pharmacological dictionary; he rejected drugs that caused instantaneous death in favour of barbiturates with a rapid serum peak for a comfortable lapse into unconsciousness. Everything would be ready by Friday, January 8, said the pharmacist, would that do? It would do. </p> <p>That evening, Romand read a story to the children. He left for Lyon on Wednesday morning. At 2.08pm he obtained 1,000 francs from the cashpoint, and another 1,000 francs at 2.45pm. Between the two withdrawals, he says, he gave a 500-franc note to a homeless person. Then, in a gun shop, he bought a stun wand, two tear gas canisters, a box of cartridges and a silencer for a .22 calibre rifle. </p> <p>\"So,\" the judge pointed out, \"you weren't thinking only of killing yourself. You were living with your wife and children while you were planning to kill them.\" </p> <p>\"That idea did surface... but it was immediately masked by other false plans, other false ideas. It was as though the idea didn't exist... I pretended... I told myself I was doing something else, that it was for a different reason, and at the same time... at the same time I was buying the bullets that would pierce my children's hearts.\" </p> <p>He sobbed. </p> <p>On the Thursday, Jean-Claude went to visit his parents in Clairvaux. The next day, after the children had gone to bed, Florence had a long phone conversation with her mother. Mme Crolet complained bitterly about being a widow, about growing old, about being neglected by her children. Her unhappiness affected Florence, who began crying after she hung up. Jean-Claude joined her on the sofa. That is the last image he has. He is sitting next to her, he has taken her in his arms, he is trying to comfort her. </p> <p>\"I don't remember her last words.\" He went on: \"I am unable to say what happened between the time when I was consoling Florence on the sofa and the moment I woke up holding the rolling pin stained with blood.\" </p> <p>Early that Saturday morning, the telephone rang, which woke the children. They were always quicker to bounce out of bed on days when they didn't have school. Jean-Claude told them that Mama was still sleeping, and the three of them went downstairs to the living room. He put a tape of The Three Little Pigs in the video, prepared bowls of Coco Pops with milk. With him in the middle, they settled themselves on the sofa to watch the cartoon while they ate their cereal. </p> <p>\"I knew after having killed Florence that I was also going to kill Antoine and Caroline and that those moments in front of the television were the last that we would spend together. I cuddled them. I must have said sweet things to them, like, 'I love you.' \" </p> <p>\"We stayed like that for perhaps an hour... Caroline saw that I was cold, she wanted to go upstairs to get my dressing gown... I said that I thought they seemed rather hot, that perhaps they had a fever and I was going to take their temperature. Caroline went upstairs with me, I had her lie down on her bed... I went to get the rifle ...\" </p> <p>\"What did you say to Caroline?\" asked the judge. </p> <p>\"I don't know any more... She'd lain down on her stomach... That's when I shot her.\" </p> <p>\"Go on...\" </p> <p>He sobbed. \"I shot Caroline the first time... She had a pillow over her head... I must have been pretending it was a game.\" Here he moaned, his eyes closed. \"I pulled the trigger... I put the rifle somewhere in the room... I called Antoine... and I did it again.\" </p> <p>\"Perhaps I should help you a bit, because the jury needs details and you're not being specific enough.\" </p> <p>\"Caroline, when she was born, it was the most wonderful day of my life... She was beautiful\" - he moaned - \"in my arms... for her first bath.\" A spasm shook his body. \"I'm the one who killed her... I'm the one who killed her.\" </p> <p>The policemen, appalled, held him gently by the arms. </p> <p>\"Don't you think Antoine could have heard the gunshots? Had you attached the silencer? Did you call him upstairs on the same pretext? To take his temperature? He didn't find that strange?\" </p> <p>\"I don't have an image of that precise moment. It was still them, but it couldn't be Caroline... it couldn't be Antoine...\" </p> <p>The prosecutor spoke up. Afterwards, he said, Romand went out to buy the local paper and a sports daily, L'Equipe, and the newspaper seller thought he looked completely normal. </p> <p>\"Were you trying to behave as if nothing had happened, as if life was going on as usual?\" </p> <p>\"I couldn't have bought L'Equipe. I never read it.\" </p> <p>\"Neighbours saw you cross the street to check your postbox.\" </p> <p>\"Did I do it to deny reality, to pretend?\" </p> <p>\"Why did you wrap up the rifle and carefully put it away before you left for Clairvaux?\" </p> <p>\"In reality, to kill them, of course, but I must have told myself that it was to return it to my father.\" </p> <p>Jean-Claude does not remember the drive to his parents' home later on the Saturday morning. We know the three of them had lunch together. Dishes were still on the table when Uncle Claude entered the house two days later, and the postmortem examination revealed that the stomachs of Aim\u00e9 and Anne-Marie Romand were full. Did Jean-Claude eat anything? Did his mother urge him to have something? What did they talk about? </p> <p>First he lured his father upstairs with the excuse of examining a malodorous air vent the old man had complained about. The old man, who couldn't bend over because of back trouble, must have knelt down to point out the defective vent, which was set into the skirting-board. That was when he received two bullets in the back. His son covered him with a wine-coloured corduroy bedspread that had been in the room since Jean-Claude's childhood. Then he went to get his mother. She hadn't heard the gunshots, fired with a silencer. He made her go into the sitting room, which they never used. She was the only one who was shot from the front. </p> <p>He carefully closed up the house and drove off at around two o'clock. He was heading for Paris where he was to meet Corinne. </p> <p> \u0095 Read the second part of the story <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,421548,00.html\"> here</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 Taken from the book The Adversary by Emmanuel Carr\u00e9re and translated by Linda Coverdale to be published by Bloomsbury on 22 January 2001 at \u009514.99</p>",

      "bodyText": "Luc Ladmiral was awakened shortly after 4am on the morning of Monday, January 11, 1993, by a telephone call. His friends the Romands' house was on fire; he should come. When Luc arrived, the firefighters were bringing out the bodies. All his life he will remember the sealed grey plastic bags into which they had put the children: too horrible to look at. Florence, Mrs Romand, had simply been covered with a coat. Her face, blackened by the smoke, was unmarked. Smoothing her hair in a desolate gesture of farewell, Luc's fingers encountered something strange. He felt around, carefully tilting the young woman's head to one side, then called over a firefighter to show him, at the base of the skull, an open wound. It must have been from a beam that fell on her, the firefighter said; part of the attic had collapsed. Luc then clambered into the red vehicle where the rescuers had placed Jean-Claude, Florence's husband, the only one of the family who was still alive. His pulse was weak. He was in pyjamas, unconscious, burned yet already as cold as a corpse. Luc and Jean-Claude had been friends ever since medical school in Lyon. They'd got married almost at the same time; their children had grown up together. Each knew everything about the other's life - the public image, but also the secrets, the secrets of honest, reliable men who were all the more vulnerable to temptation. When Jean-Claude had confided in him about an affair, talked about chucking everything in, Luc had made him listen to reason. Their lives were very similar, even if they hadn't succeeded in the same way. Jean-Claude had become a leading figure in the world of medical research, hobnobbing with government ministers, always off at international conferences, while Luc was a GP in Ferney-Voltaire, a town on the French side of the Swiss border, just a few miles north of Geneva. The Romands lived in the nearby village of Pr\u00e9vessin. Later that Monday morning, Luc phoned the casualty department in Geneva: Jean-Claude, who was 38, had been placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber; the prognosis was guarded. Luc prayed with his wife C\u00e9cile and the children that he would never regain consciousness. When Luc went to his office, two policemen were waiting for him. Their questions seemed odd. They wanted to know if the Romands had any enemies, if they'd been involved in any suspicious activities... Seeing Luc's astonishment, the police told him the truth. An initial examination of the bodies revealed that the victims had died before the fire, Florence from head injuries inflicted by a blunt instrument, the children - five-year-old Antoine and seven-year-old Caroline - from bullet wounds. That wasn't all. In Clairvaux-les-Lacs, in the Jura Mountains some 50 miles to the north-west of Ferney, Jean-Claude's uncle had been delegated to break the tragic news to the injured man's parents, a frail elderly couple. Accompanied by their doctor, he had found the house locked, the dog mysteriously silent. Worried, the uncle had broken open the door to discover his brother, his sister-in-law and the dog lying in their own blood. They, too, had been shot. Murdered. The Romands had been murdered. The word echoed through Luc's brain, stunning him. \"Was it a robbery?\" he asked, as if that word might somehow reduce the horror. The officers asked again about possible enemies, and Luc, at a loss, shook his head. Enemies? The Romands? Everyone loved them. The police needed to find out exactly what Jean-Claude did for a living. A doctor, the neighbours had said, but he didn't have a surgery. Luc explained that he was a researcher at the World Health Organisation (WHO), in Geneva. One of the officers telephoned, asking to speak to someone who worked with Dr Romand. The receptionist did not know any Dr Romand. She connected the officer to the personnel director, who consulted his files and confirmed: there was no Dr Romand at WHO. In the course of that day, reality became even more nightmarish. Summoned to the police station in the afternoon, Luc learned that a note in Jean-Claude's handwriting confessing to the crimes had been found in his car and that everything people thought they knew about his career and professional activities was a sham. The WHO? No one there had ever heard of him. The national registry of physicians? He wasn't listed. The hospitals in Paris where he was said to be on the medical staff? He was not accredited there, nor was he a graduate of the medical school in Lyon where Luc himself, and several others, swore nevertheless to have been students with him. He had begun his studies, yes, but had stopped taking his exams at the end of the second year; from then on, it was all false. Latterly, Jean-Claude had confessed to Luc that he was suffering from cancer, for which he said he was being treated in Paris by the eminent oncologist L\u00e9on Schwartzenberg. Also false. Dr Schwartzenberg had no record of Jean-Claude Romand, nor had the oncology department of any other hospital in France. At first, Luc simply refused to believe this. When someone tells you that your best friend, your daughter's godfather, the most respectable man you know has killed his wife, his children, his parents, and that in addition he has been lying to you about everything for years, isn't it normal to go on believing in him, even in the face of overwhelming proof? It soon came out that Jean-Claude had an on-off relationship with a woman called Corinne Hourtin - a child psychologist, now divorced, who had once lived in Ferney with her husband R\u00e9mi. She had handed over to Jean-Claude 900,000 francs (about \u00a390,000) in savings that he was to have invested for her in Switzerland. He had embezzled it instead. Other revelations came from Florence's family, the Crolets. They, too, had entrusted money to Jean-Claude: first the father's retirement bonus, and then, after his death, a million francs netted from the sale of his house. Their grief was compounded by an agonising suspicion: M Crolet had died in a fall on a staircase when he was alone with Jean-Claude. Had he been yet another victim of his son-in-law? Everyone was wondering: how could we have lived beside this man for so long without suspecting a thing? Everyone tried to remember a moment when some suspicion had crossed their minds. Luc himself remembered that he'd been struck by something a few months earlier, after learning from Florence that Jean-Claude had ranked fifth in all of Paris in his finals. What astonished Luc wasn't this achievement but the fact that he hadn't learned of it at the time. Why hadn't Jean-Claude mentioned it? Questioned, accused of being secretive, Jean-Claude had shrugged, said he didn't want to make a big deal of it, and changed the subject. It was extraordinary, this ability to deflect conversation whenever it turned to him. Thinking back on it, you ended up admiring his discretion, his modesty, his desire to show others to advantage. Yet Luc had felt vaguely that there was something not quite right in what Jean-Claude said about his career. He'd considered calling WHO to discover exactly what it was he did there - but had decided the whole thing was absurd. And now he kept telling himself that if he'd gone through with it, maybe things would have turned out differently. \"Perhaps,\" said C\u00e9cile when he told her of his remorse, \"... perhaps he would have killed you as well.\" Three days after the fire, the Ladmirals learned that Jean-Claude was going to live. Jean-Claude Romand's early childhood was spent in a small village in the Jura where his father ran a farm. Neighbours, cousins, schoolteachers all remember a well-behaved little boy, quiet and sweet, whom some are tempted to describe as too well-behaved, too quiet, too sweet. An only child, perhaps somewhat overprotected by his mother. A child who never got up to any mischief, more respectable - if one can say that about a child - than truly lovable, but even so a child whom no one imagined to be unhappy. He says that his mother worried all the time and that he learned early on to mislead her so that she wouldn't worry even more. He admired his father for never showing his feelings and tried to imitate him. It was better to conceal them. On the one hand, he had been taught not to lie, and that was absolute dogma: a Romand was as good as his word, a Romand told the truth and shamed the Devil. On the other hand, there were certain things you shouldn't say, even if they were true. You had to avoid upsetting anyone, or boasting about your success or your good qualities. Romand achieves good grades at school. He originally plans to become a forester, but then changes his mind and decides to study medicine instead at Lyon. At the end of his second year, in 1975, he needs to resit one exam. He fails to turn up, but he tells no one, and no one notices. Three weeks went by between the day of the examination and the posting of the results. There was still time for him to admit that he had lied. It would have been hard for him, naturally. To this serious young man, it must have seemed impossibly painful to admit a whopping error, a childish blunder like that of Antoine Doinel in Les Quatre-Cent Coups, who extricates himself from a sticky situation at school by blurting out that his mother has just died, and who then must deal with the inevitable consequences of his lies and the certainty that the truth will come out. The most baffling thing, in Romand's case, is that he committed his folly in two stages, like the computer user who, having accidentally typed the command for erasing a valuable file, when asked by the program whether he's sure he wants to delete the file, carefully considers the pros and cons - then goes ahead and destroys it anyway. Rationally speaking, anything would have been better than what Jean-Claude did: he waited for the day the results were posted and then announced that he had passed, that he'd been accepted as a third-year medical student. How could he have foreseen that there was something worse than being quickly unmasked, which was not to be unmasked; how could he have suspected that this childish lie would lead him 18 years later to murder his parents, Florence, and the children he did not yet have? While still ostensibly studying medicine, Jean-Claude marries Florence Crolet, a fellow student at Lyon. He supposedly passes his medical board exam and becomes first a research assistant in a medical research institution and then a research scientist at the World Health Organisation in Geneva. Romand was always, as Florence put it, \"very compartmentalised\", strictly separating his personal and professional relations, never inviting colleagues from WHO to his house, refusing to allow himself to be disturbed at home by anyone from his office, or at work by any of his family or friends. Moreover, nobody had his office phone number, not even his wife, who contacted him through an answering service: you left a message in a voice mailbox, which sent him a signal on the bleeper he always carried with him, and then he quickly called back. Neither his wife nor anyone else found the arrangement strange. It was one of his personality traits, like his gruffness, which she often joked about: \"One of these days, I'm going to find out my husband's a communist spy.\" In the mornings, he was the one who drove the children to the Ecole Saint-Vincent. He would accompany them into the courtyard, exchange a few words with the teachers or the pupils' mothers, then drive off towards Geneva. More often than not he ended up in the car park of WHO. Entering with a visitor's badge, carrying a briefcase, he followed a familiar orbit, going from the ground-floor library to the conference rooms and the publications office, where he systematically swept up anything printed and free: his house and car overflowed with papers bearing the letterhead or stamp of WHO. He used all the services offered by the organisation - a post office where he sent his mail, a bank where he made most of his withdrawals, a travel agency through which he planned the family holidays - but did not risk going upstairs, where security guards might have asked him what he was looking for. His mother-in-law remembers that one Sunday when the whole family had gone to Switzerland, the children had wanted to see Papa's office, so Papa had agreed to the detour. They'd pulled into the car park, he'd pointed out the window. And that's all. At first he went to WHO every day, later less regularly. He'd stop at a news-stand to buy an armful of papers: dailies, magazines, scientific journals. Then he'd go and read them, either in a cafe - he was careful to change cafes often and to choose them far enough from home - or in his car. He would park in a car park or at a service station and stay there for hours, reading, taking notes, dozing. He'd have a sandwich for lunch and continue reading throughout the afternoon in a different cafe, at a different service station. Other days, he needed open air and nature, and would drive into the Jura Mountains. Lastly, there were the trips - conferences, seminars, symposiums, all over the world. He would buy a guide to the country; Florence would pack his suitcase. He'd drive off in his car, which he would supposedly leave in the long-term car park at Geneva airport. In a comfortable hotel room, often near the airport, he would take off his shoes, stretch out on the bed, spend three or four days watching television and the planes taking off and landing outside his window. He studied the guide books so he wouldn't make any mistakes in his stories when he got home. He telephoned his family every day to tell them what time it was and what the weather was like in Sao Paulo or Tokyo. He'd tell his wife, his children, his parents that he missed them, was thinking of them, sent them a big kiss. After a few days, he went home with presents bought in an airport gift shop. Everyone made a fuss of him. He was tired from jet lag. Indirectly it was WHO that provided Jean-Claude with a source of income. He said or let it be understood that as an international civil servant he was in a position to make extremely advantageous investments at a rate of 18%, an opportunity he could share with his family. Jean-Claude's parents were not the kind of people to cheat on their taxes by putting their savings into Swiss banks, but as it was their son's idea that was enough for them. Romand lived on their nest egg at the beginning of his marriage. Florence declared to the income tax authorities the very modest salary she earned by temporarily filling in for pharmacists in the area, and he declared no income because, since he worked in Switzerland, he had - he said - no taxes to pay. The year Antoine was born, Florence's father retired from his job in Annecy. A disguised redundancy, his retirement brought him a bonus of 400,000 francs. Jean-Claude agreed to do his father-in-law a favour by investing 378,000 francs for him at a Geneva bank. This sum was deposited in an account in Jean-Claude's name, since he was the one whose position entitled him to make such an investment. But one day Jean-Claude's father-in-law told him he wanted to withdraw part of his capital to buy a Mercedes. A few weeks later, on October 23, 1988, Pierre Crolet fell on the stairs of his home where he was alone with his son-in-law and died just before the arrival of the paramedics. After the fire, a new investigation was ordered at the request of the Crolet family. Of course, it uncovered nothing. At the end of the proceedings, Jean-Claude insisted on telling the Crolet family, as God was his witness, that he had had no hand in his father-in-law's death. Short of a confession on his part some day, we will never learn any more. What is indisputable is that the death of his father-in-law was providential for Romand. There was no longer any question of touching the money in the Swiss account. Then Mme Crolet decided to sell the house, now too large for her on her own, and handed over to her son-in-law the proceeds of the sale, which amounted to 1.3million francs. Romand had become enraptured with Corinne Hourtin and they begin an affair when she moves to Paris. But she soon decides that she could never love him. He confides in her, as he he did to Luc Ladmiral, that he is suffering from cancer. They remain friends, and she turns to him when she had money to invest, handing over 900,000 francs in cash. He flies from Paris with a small suitcase stuffed with notes. Soon after, Corinne decides she wants some of her money back, but finds Romand evasive. Just before the 1992 Christmas holidays, the president of the school board wanted to talk to Jean-Claude on the subject of a demoted head. The president did not know Jean-Claude well enough to be aware that one didn't call him at his office, and he had his secretary look up Jean-Claude's number in the WHO directory. Puzzled at not finding him anywhere, he imagined there must be some explanation, and he didn't think about it again until one day after the holiday when he ran into Florence in the main street of Ferney and told her about it. His tone wasn't that of a man who had suspicions but that of someone who was curious to find out the real story behind an odd mystery, and Florence reacted equally mildly. It was strange, yes, there was obviously a reason, and she'd speak to her husband about it. Florence and the man did not see each other again. One week later she was dead, and no one will ever know if she brought it up with Jean-Claude. He says she didn't. Although he was unsure where the first blow would come from, he knew that the hounds were closing in. His various bank accounts would soon be overdrawn, and he had no means of replenishing them. People were talking about him, and talking about coming after him. Hands were flipping through directories. The look in Florence's eyes had changed. He was scared. In the run-up to Christmas, he flew to Paris and took Corinne to dinner at the Restaurant Michel Rostang. Corinne told him that she had made up her mind and she wanted all of her money back. Instead of trying to wriggle out of it, he opened his diary to set up a meeting when he would hand over the funds. Turning the pages, he had an idea: he had agreed to have dinner at the start of the new year with his friend Bernard Kouchner, illustrious co-founder of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. Would Corinne like to join them? Of course Corinne would like that. Before then, though, he would be dead. On the flight home, he continued to study his diary. Christmas wasn't a good day, that would be too cruel for the children. Caroline was going to play Mary and Antoine one of the shepherds in the Nativity play at the church. So, right after New Year? Jean-Claude did not go to work on the Tuesday after the New Year. Florence and he ran errands in Ferney. She insisted that he buy a new suit; he let himself be tempted by a parka for 3,200 francs. The saleswoman thought they seemed a couple who were at leisure, well-off, and getting along fine. Jean-Claude had spent the morning studying books such as the Vidal pharmacological dictionary; he rejected drugs that caused instantaneous death in favour of barbiturates with a rapid serum peak for a comfortable lapse into unconsciousness. Everything would be ready by Friday, January 8, said the pharmacist, would that do? It would do. That evening, Romand read a story to the children. He left for Lyon on Wednesday morning. At 2.08pm he obtained 1,000 francs from the cashpoint, and another 1,000 francs at 2.45pm. Between the two withdrawals, he says, he gave a 500-franc note to a homeless person. Then, in a gun shop, he bought a stun wand, two tear gas canisters, a box of cartridges and a silencer for a .22 calibre rifle. \"So,\" the judge pointed out, \"you weren't thinking only of killing yourself. You were living with your wife and children while you were planning to kill them.\" \"That idea did surface... but it was immediately masked by other false plans, other false ideas. It was as though the idea didn't exist... I pretended... I told myself I was doing something else, that it was for a different reason, and at the same time... at the same time I was buying the bullets that would pierce my children's hearts.\" He sobbed. On the Thursday, Jean-Claude went to visit his parents in Clairvaux. The next day, after the children had gone to bed, Florence had a long phone conversation with her mother. Mme Crolet complained bitterly about being a widow, about growing old, about being neglected by her children. Her unhappiness affected Florence, who began crying after she hung up. Jean-Claude joined her on the sofa. That is the last image he has. He is sitting next to her, he has taken her in his arms, he is trying to comfort her. \"I don't remember her last words.\" He went on: \"I am unable to say what happened between the time when I was consoling Florence on the sofa and the moment I woke up holding the rolling pin stained with blood.\" Early that Saturday morning, the telephone rang, which woke the children. They were always quicker to bounce out of bed on days when they didn't have school. Jean-Claude told them that Mama was still sleeping, and the three of them went downstairs to the living room. He put a tape of The Three Little Pigs in the video, prepared bowls of Coco Pops with milk. With him in the middle, they settled themselves on the sofa to watch the cartoon while they ate their cereal. \"I knew after having killed Florence that I was also going to kill Antoine and Caroline and that those moments in front of the television were the last that we would spend together. I cuddled them. I must have said sweet things to them, like, 'I love you.' \" \"We stayed like that for perhaps an hour... Caroline saw that I was cold, she wanted to go upstairs to get my dressing gown... I said that I thought they seemed rather hot, that perhaps they had a fever and I was going to take their temperature. Caroline went upstairs with me, I had her lie down on her bed... I went to get the rifle ...\" \"What did you say to Caroline?\" asked the judge. \"I don't know any more... She'd lain down on her stomach... That's when I shot her.\" \"Go on...\" He sobbed. \"I shot Caroline the first time... She had a pillow over her head... I must have been pretending it was a game.\" Here he moaned, his eyes closed. \"I pulled the trigger... I put the rifle somewhere in the room... I called Antoine... and I did it again.\" \"Perhaps I should help you a bit, because the jury needs details and you're not being specific enough.\" \"Caroline, when she was born, it was the most wonderful day of my life... She was beautiful\" - he moaned - \"in my arms... for her first bath.\" A spasm shook his body. \"I'm the one who killed her... I'm the one who killed her.\" The policemen, appalled, held him gently by the arms. \"Don't you think Antoine could have heard the gunshots? Had you attached the silencer? Did you call him upstairs on the same pretext? To take his temperature? He didn't find that strange?\" \"I don't have an image of that precise moment. It was still them, but it couldn't be Caroline... it couldn't be Antoine...\" The prosecutor spoke up. Afterwards, he said, Romand went out to buy the local paper and a sports daily, L'Equipe, and the newspaper seller thought he looked completely normal. \"Were you trying to behave as if nothing had happened, as if life was going on as usual?\" \"I couldn't have bought L'Equipe. I never read it.\" \"Neighbours saw you cross the street to check your postbox.\" \"Did I do it to deny reality, to pretend?\" \"Why did you wrap up the rifle and carefully put it away before you left for Clairvaux?\" \"In reality, to kill them, of course, but I must have told myself that it was to return it to my father.\" Jean-Claude does not remember the drive to his parents' home later on the Saturday morning. We know the three of them had lunch together. Dishes were still on the table when Uncle Claude entered the house two days later, and the postmortem examination revealed that the stomachs of Aim\u00e9 and Anne-Marie Romand were full. Did Jean-Claude eat anything? Did his mother urge him to have something? What did they talk about? First he lured his father upstairs with the excuse of examining a malodorous air vent the old man had complained about. The old man, who couldn't bend over because of back trouble, must have knelt down to point out the defective vent, which was set into the skirting-board. That was when he received two bullets in the back. His son covered him with a wine-coloured corduroy bedspread that had been in the room since Jean-Claude's childhood. Then he went to get his mother. She hadn't heard the gunshots, fired with a silencer. He made her go into the sitting room, which they never used. She was the only one who was shot from the front. He carefully closed up the house and drove off at around two o'clock. He was heading for Paris where he was to meet Corinne. \u0095 Read the second part of the story here. \u0095 Taken from the book The Adversary by Emmanuel Carr\u00e9re and translated by Linda Coverdale to be published by Bloomsbury on 22 January 2001 at \u009514.99",

But through the unnamed narrator, the child who will never compensate for the loss of his big brother, Treichel sustains a dark comedy of adult grief and childish hope. The parents' efforts to discover whether an orphan child, known only by its number, might be Arnold, is a high point of sad comedy. The boy's selfish desire that Arnold be lost forever, and his cynicism towards his parents' grief, are utterly convincing.

I looked at the books I was reading to my daughter and they did look very short. I'm extremely lazy and thought that a picture book, with very few words, would be the easiest thing to write.\" </p> <p>In fact, she found out, it's the hardest. \"I know that now. I didn't win, but I loved writing my story so much that I just kept right on trying to do it.\" That first story, Apricots at Midnight, was published, and her accidental career was under way. </p> <p>Geras has written both novels and poetry, including a single poem for adults, \"The Sampler Alphabet\", for which she won the Housman Society prize and an Arts Council award last year. Her stories range from those picture-books to Troy, which, though published on a children's list, is for readers of all ages. It's not a retelling of Homer; Geras describes it as \"a story about five young people who happen to be living in the besieged city of Troy just before it's sacked. It's a domestic and youthful view of the events of the Trojan War, rather than the heroic and traditional one.\" </p> <p>This is a love story in which runaway romance is tethered by the domestic needs that continue behind the scenes of the war. The world of the people of Troy is made real, and even the presence of the gods seems a convincing detail of everyday life. </p> <p>The span of Geras's writing reflects her own experience and enthusiasms. Troy was triggered by her passionate support for the Trojans as a child, but her early childhood in Jerusalem, schooling at Roedean and spell of acting at Oxford have all fuelled different stories. \"Everything I write is different from what I have written before. I write entirely for pleasure: first my own and then other people's. I'm the first person who has not to be bored, has to cry when it's sad, fall in love with the hero and so forth.\" </p> <p>The legacy of Geras's Jewish background and her early years growing up in Jerusalem is reflected in her novels Voyage and Girls in a Velvet Frame. In different ways, both tell the familiar story of early 19th-century Jewish emigration to the US from the warmth of a close-knit family. Describing herself as a Jewish atheist, Geras loves the culture but not the religion, and has retold traditional Jewish stories in two collections now published in one volume as Stories from Jerusalem . </p> <p>It was Roedean that provided the inspiration for her Egerton Hall novels, a trilogy of tales each revolving around the theme of a traditional fairy story. \"I wanted to combine my three favourite kinds of stories - school stories, love stories and fairy stories - and my own school seemed the perfect setting. I was very happy at Roedean, even though I was away from my parents and only had my school trunk to keep everything in.\" </p> <p>It was at Roedean, too, that Geras learnt the discipline of writing. \"On the downside, I stopped writing the kind of poems and plays for my friends to perform that I'd done before I went, because there was 'proper work' to be done. But my English teachers were brilliant, and I often feel that I write for them. They had very active red pens that were forever pointing out things like irrelevant adjectives, of which I was very fond.\" </p> <p>At the time, Geras did not know how important that would be, as her ambitions lay in quite a different direction. \"I spent a lot of time at school preparing to be a singing star. I went to the movies as often as possible, listened to songs and performed in everything I could perform in. I was going to be the new Judy Garland.\" At Oxford, Geras hardly had time to put pen to paper as she got in training for an acting career. \"I was in every single thing I could manage. Best of all was Hang Down Your Head and Die, an anti-capital punishment show which we took to the West End. It got rave reviews, though I haven't forgiven the critic for calling me a 'stocky brunette'. The fact that it was true made it all the more awful.\" </p> <p>A brief spell of acting in London followed, but Geras found being an out-of-work actress was no fun. Now married, she became a teacher instead and, though useless at keeping order, was able to keep going by treating every lesson as a kind of performance. </p> <p>Her novels set in a school of performing arts, a series of ballet stories and re-tellings of opera stories all reflect Geras's love of the theatre, but she has also written ghost stories, family stories and animal stories, even writing as a cat. Whatever she writes, Geras loves detail, describing rooms, clothes, food with precision, lifting a mirror from someone's house or a necklace seen at a party. </p> <p>When her children were small, she didn't write stories for them but pinched the details of their lives for authenticity. Though they are now adults, Geras still uses them to get things right. For Troy , she drew on her younger daughter's Classical Studies A-level essays; her older daughter, poet and novelist Sophie Hannah, read the first draft and put her straight about how sisters behave towards one another. </p> <p>Geras is now writing a follow-up to Troy , \"which is definitely not a sequel\". Beyond that, she says, who knows? \"Not fantasy or science fiction, though. I think you write the kind of books you know you can write, and which you enjoy reading.\"</p>",

It's not that she considers science a bad way of knowing the real world. But it is only one among many, and one which must be kept in firmly its place.</p> <p> In a characteristic image, she compares human knowledge to the dolphin tank in a zoo: \"human life [is] like an enormous, ill-lit aquarium which we never see fully from above, but only through various small windows unevenly distributed around it. Scientific windows - like historical ones - are just one important set among these. Fish and other strange creatures constantly swim away from particular windows... reappearing where different lighting can make them hard to recognise. Long experience, along with constant dashing around between windows, does give us a good deal of skill in tracking them. But if we refuse to put together the data from different widows, then we can be in real trouble.\"</p> <p>She started looking in from a window that has now almost vanished. She was born in 1919, the daughter of Canon Tom Scrutton, then the chaplain of King's College, Cambridge, and had a conventional middle class upbringing in a large vicarage in Greenford, which was at the time a village distinct from west London and is now a rather gloomy suburb. Her father, she says, was \"a rather notorious pacifist: the chair of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship. He had been a chaplain in the first world war, and had had to explain to people why they were dying. That had put him off war.\" Her mother, Lesley, n\u00e9e Hay, was the daughter of the Scots engineer who built the Mersey Tunnel. Her elder brother. Hugh Scrutton, became a distinguished art gallery director.</p> <p> At 12, she was sent to Downe House, a boarding school which had been started in Darwin's old home, though it later moved. She found it a rather an enlightened place. \"I loved it. There was quite a lot of spare time, quite a good library, and a headmistress interested in all sorts of things. I got philosophy when I was there: when I was about 16 I picked Plato off the shelf and thought it was tremendous stuff.\" </p> <p> By this time, she had realised that she was not a Christian. \"Christianity never really took. I tried to operate it, but there never seemed to be anybody there.\" When she eventually explained to her father, he accepted without fuss that she just didn\u00cdt have the right temperament.</p> <p> In 1938 she went up to Somerville College as senior scholar. Iris Murdoch was in the same year, and they became close friends at once; Elizabeth Anscombe, later to become Wittgenstein's foremost disciple, who died last week, was a year ahead of her, and the moral philosopher Philippa Foot a year behind her. Foot says today, \"[Mary] was a very grand figure indeed.\" For Midgley, the war years were a uniquely wonderful time to be a woman studying philosophy at Oxford. \"I think the fact that there was not an endless gaggle of young men who were distracting helped us - and there was nobody doing philosophy then who didn't really want to do it. Also, there didn't seem to be a future, so nobody was thinking of careers.\"</p> <p> Many of the women left, too, for war work. But she stayed, with her friends, rather than rush off to volunteer for some job where they could be pretty sure their talents would be misused. \"It wasn't that we underestimated the evil that was out there, or that we didn\u00cdt want to do our bit, but it didn't seem to us a trifling matter to try and make sense of Kant meanwhile.\" </p> <p> There were also politics to contend with. Murdoch had joined the Communist party soon after coming up, an act which seemed to her circle like a kind of ordination. \"The party was very important, it was there like the church: only really serious people actually joined it. There\u00cds nothing like that out there now: there's nothing righteous by way of a cause that one is refusing to join. I and my other friends had this guilty feeling that it was our insufficiency that prevented us from following her, but there were also the [Stalinist] treason trials...\"</p> <p> One way or another, these kept Midgley out of the party, and when the Oxford Labour club split after the Hitler-Stalin pact, she ended up on the committee of the new social democratic club, along with Roy Jenkins and Tony Crosland. \"I remember Roy Jenkins, as a slender youth, singing Frankie and Johnny at committee meetings.\" Perhaps a woman who has seen the subsequent vice-chancellor, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, in this light would never be unduly impressed with the pomp and gravity of Oxford. In any case, she has few regrets about leaving the place. </p> <p>\"I put in for the job that Mary Warnock got at St Hugh's. It was providential, really. I would have been destroyed by the terribly destructive and critical atmosphere. It isn\u00cdt destructive of everyone, but look what happened to Isaiah Berlin, who also started as an Oxford philosopher. They kind of frightened him to the point where he said I shall go away and do the history of thought. I think pretty much the same thing happened to Iris Murdoch. The minute you got out of Oxford a great weight lifted, at least for a person like me.\" </p> <p> This disdain is mutual, even when strongly coloured with affection. Her friend Philippa Foot, who thrived in Oxford after the war, says, \"Her mind doesn't quite work like most straight Oxford analytic philosophers, I'd say. I don't mean that we're not keen on the poor old planet, but we don't talk about it an awful lot. It doesn't come into our work. I think she found her forte being witty and sane on television.\"</p> <p> In 1945 she met Geoffrey Midgley, who was doing a doctorate at New College. \"The dominant philosophical line at Oxford at that time was a refined kind of logical positivism. But there were also present highly metaphysical people like Elizabeth Anscombe and Peter Geach. So there was a very great deal of argument. Someone brought him round to my rooms in Park Town at about 11 o'clock one morning, and we were still arguing at six that evening. But what impressed him was that I had produced a pork pie and a tin of spaghetti to enable the argument to continue.\"</p> <p>He found a job in Newcastle but after a year they met again, and got engaged. They were married in 1950. She had three sons in five years and stopped working, except for reviewing children's books and novels for the New Statesman. This interruption supplies one of the most distinctive qualities of her thought: to the natural Oxonian self-confidence which assumes that learning is important and foolishness a crime, she adds a belief that the learned are often importantly foolish. </p> <p>Sometimes this leads her to aim at soft targets but also to some exhilarating removals of the Emperor's New Trousers. \"Inside every real philosopher\", she has written, \"is not only a lawyer, but also that lawyer's client: someone with a substantial idea to express.\" </p> <p>The ideas she considers really substantial are those which deal with Aristotelean questions: how should men and women live (not that Aristotle had any interest in women's lives), and she has little time, or inclination for more Platonic interests in pure logic or ultimate reality. In Science And Poetry she writes, \"Any major kind of philosophising always presents some distinctive ideal for life as well as for thought because life and thought are not really separate at all, and if the contemporary academic philosophers suppose they are not doing this they are mistaken. Academic narrowness is a style of thought as much as any other. It is quite as easily conveyed by a style of writing, and even more easily by a style of teaching.\" </p> <p> This distance from academic proprieties comes out in her friendship and admiration for James Lovelock, the originator of the Gaia hypothesis. \"I think we all have a pretty high opinion of her\", he says. \"She's so right about science. It is becoming fragmented to such an extent that the average scientist is now a specialist who knows no more outside his speciality than the average layman; and somebody needed to say that.\" The fierceness of her character seems to him a purely professional affectation. \"She's enormously good at friendship. In the academic world they are prepared to say in print things that none of us would dare say in person, but I don\u00cdt think they feel it the same way.\" </p> <p> He met her when she gave a talk on one of her favourite metaphors: philosophy as plumbing. The idea that it is something on which civilisation depends, but which no one notices until it goes badly wrong, when you have to bring a specialist. It's about as far removed from the ivory tower as any idea might be, and you could not get further from academic narrowness than the place where she emerged after her interlude of motherhood as a publishing philosopher, in the 70s. </p> <p> She started with the problems of animal behaviour, reading Konrad Lorenz and Nico Tinbergen, who shared a Nobel prize for their researches into the ways that animal behaviour is as much a genetic product as are animal bodies. Animals inherit their ways of thought and feeling quite as much as the leopard inherits its spots. This is now the stock of hundreds of pop science books, but back then it was worth a Nobel prize. But, of course, since we are a species of animal, we too must have inherited predispositions and these will shape the ways we understand the world, and things we can hope to get out of it. </p> <p> These are not ideas which would have appeared strange to any philosopher until about 1900. Since then it has been almost axiomatic that philosophy has nothing very authoritative to say about how we should live. When Midgley got interested in the question in the early 70s, it was unusual enough to get her invited for a year to Cornell University. Out of that came Beast And Man. \"I wrote no books until I was a good 50, and I'm jolly glad because I didn\u00cdt know what I thought before then; if I had been an academic I would have had to publish, whether I knew what I thought or not. The idea that in philosophy or English you can have 16 new ideas a year is ridiculous.\" </p> <p> For a lot of the 20th century it was a precondition of respectable psychology to pretend that consciousness was an illusion; and in philosophy, questions of purpose had come to seem illegitimate or outside the scope of the business, just as they were in science. But recognising that human beings are a sort of animal lets these questions of purpose back in. At the same time, Darwinism was enabling scientists to ask the question \"what are things for\" and get answers that looked scientific as well as philosophical. </p> <p>The convergence of so many different lines of enquiry on these questions was unfortunate. When the humanists met the scientists, the middle ground was churned into a muddy no-man's-land of controversy, where only the bravest dared change their position by scuttling between shell holes and opponents' positions were illuminated only to make it easier to fire on them. </p> <p> John Cornwell, the writer and director of the science and religion project at Jesus College Cambridge, says, \"Mary is an excellent thing, of course. Whenever you look for a debate, she is the natural against the ultra-Darwinists, like Richard Dawkins or Dan Dennett. But although she often professes to be talking about science, she does draw an equivalence between scientism [applying scientific method inappropriately] and science. I think a lot of the stuff she does is very good knockabout, which pleases people who don't like science, and she tends to lump together an enormous amount in her criticisms. </p> <p> \"I tackled her once exactly on this point about confusing scientism with science, at a conference I organised. It was in the evening down in the college bar: she had collected a gang of groupies, and when I had finished, she declared to the audience, 'is Cornwell drunk?'. She's very feisty. I was entirely sober: but just for making this point against her, I got the treatment. She's a daunting opponent, and she does go as close to playing dirty as you can get.\" With all that said, Midgley remains surrounded by affection, described by many as \"an excellent ting\". As Philippa Foot says, \"She's raised three splendid foals, and so on. She's very much someone who is very successful in family life.\" Steven Rose, the professor of biology at the Open University, attended her 80th birthday party: \"We only learnt that there was an enormous circle of people who would meet round at her house when we went up there. She was simply surrounded with affection and respect. Yet she is formidable. She's incapable of being stopped once she's started. </p> <p> \"She was on a radio programme once with John Gribbin [the physicist and writer], and eventually her patience burst. So she put her hand over her eyes, closed her eyes, and turned away; then she launched into a tremendous denunciation. Melvyn Bragg, who was presenting the show was enchanted and frustrated by it because of course he couldn\u00cdt catch her eye or signal to her.\" </p> <p> The vehement clashes on such occasions are not scientific or factual at all. It's true that Midgley misunderstood the early work of Richard Dawkins and took violent offence at its use as justification for bad philosophical positions; he in turn took undying umbrage at what she had written, but those disputes are in part the kind of misunderstanding that might have been sorted out if the participants could sit down and talk. The bitter question has become an insoluble one of academic competence, part of the war between science and the humanities.</p> <p> Midgley feels that modern scientists, though they have realised what the urgent problems of the human race are, still talk as if science, or simply increasing knowledge, could solve them. But \"If there is one thing that we know from the long and hard experience of the human race, it is that what is wrong is not simple.\" </p> <p> She started off much more horrified, she says, by the stupidity of her own tribe, the humanists and sociologists, who believed that human nature was either uninteresting or non-existent; and that if it did exist, it could be moulded into any shape we wanted. One place where this was a real problem was feminism: the question do women differ from men only in the position of their dangly bits, or in their hearts and minds too, is not purely academic. Science, philosophy and ethics all can help to solve it, but that is not what makes it urgent. It's interesting because it is a question that everyone must solve in their own lives, and which various academic disciplines can help them to solve. Those have always been the kind of questions that interest Midgley. </p> <p> But now that everyone is more or less a sociobiologist, or Darwinian in polite society, what really distinguishes her controversial position is the idea that pre-Darwinian ideas of human nature are likely to be just as accurate and a great deal more revealing than whatever the latest pop-science best-seller tells us. There are times when she seems to be reacting to the imperialisms of science with her own just as determined imperialism: in Science And Poetry she returns to her roots as a Latin scholar, and traces a lot of the philosophical mistakes committed by modern scientists all the way back to the pagan Roman poet Lucretius: \"It was Lucretius,\"she writes, \"who launched the notion of science as primarily a benign kind of weedkiller designed to get rid of religion, and did it in great rolling passionate hexameters which gave it a force it would never have had if it had been expressed in unemotive prose. </p> <p> \"I am not saying that the atomic theory would never have emerged in science if it had not had those particular philosophical and poetic roots in ancient Rome. I am saying that, if the theory had had different roots, it would not have brought with it this particular word-picture, this myth, this drama, this way of accommodating science in the range of human activities, this notion of what it is to have a scientific attitude (it would no doubt have brought a different one).\" </p> <p> Such assertions are anathema to the kind of scientist who believes that his theories arise strictly from the facts. Certainly, it doesn't account for the developments of science which postulate things we literally cannot picture, such as modern particle physics. But it certainly explains the way in which phrases that can have a strict scientific meaning, such as \"genes for something\" can spread in the wider culture with meanings that would horrify the scientists involved if they thought them important. But of course few do. For most, the metaphors in which their theories are described really are no more significant than the tulips in front of a nuclear power station, whereas she sees metaphorical thought as the ground on which even nuclear power stations are built. </p> <p> This is in part a consequence of her attitude to religion. Though she is not any sort of Christian, believing that too many of the essential doctrines of Christianity are impossible for a decent and educated person to subscribe to, she remains convinced that the religions of the world can't simply be superseded because we don't like them. \"It is absurd to talk as if religion consisted entirely of mindless anxiety, bad cosmology, and human sacrifice.\" </p> <p> There is a sense of rather Victorian moral astringency about her that preserves the high-minded and disciplined attitudes that led privileged Oxford youth to see the Communist party as a kind of church. \"It is an extraordinary thing to say of someone that they cannot control a character flaw\", she once said about the certainties of one her opponents; and she meant it, whereas nowadays it is more common to find it remarkable when anyone does manage to overcome a failing. </p> <p> The great thing to be said for organised religion, she believes is precisely that it is not disorganised. \"People are naturally ceremonial, ritualistic, and naturally inclined to find purposes in things. If these impulses are not brought together and disciplined, you get something even worse than organised religion. I feel this about the Guardian's anti-royal campaign. If you don't have your ceremonial life centred on royalty, you've got it centred on pop stars, and that's worse. It's all a matter of the lesser evil.\" </p> <p> This fierce sense that organised religion has learned from its own mistakes fired her two shortest and perhaps most enjoyable books, Science As Salvation and Evolution As A Religion. These systematically dissect the ways in which much modern science simply assumes that scientists have the same kind of function in a scientific universe as priests had in a religiously motivated one, and the idiocies that follow from this assumption. </p> <p> For instance, there are plenty of theologians who believe that God made creatures so they could know him and love him. That is a ridiculous claim on its own, but what are we to make of the remark by two prominent physicists that \"a physicist is an atom\u00cds way of knowing about an atom?\" She uses that as a classic example of folie de grandeur and adds: \"It should surely be obvious that, if the universe is the kind of thing capable of knowing or wanting to know anything, it can do this on its own, and does not need help from physicists.\" </p> <p> For all the obvious difficulties about believing in God, or in anything else that might answer our prayers, Midgley points out that prayer has been immensely important in history: \"People have achieved the most amazing things by putting their trust in providence, or indeed by praying. They were not thinking about the virgin birth or the atonement when they did that. But they were thinking in a way that does seem central to human effort. I think it is reasonable to say that one can think that way with respect to the creation as a whole. All the formulations that one makes about this have something wrong with them, and it is very easy to say that there is something wrong with them; but that\u00cds not to say that we can live without the religious attitude.\" </p> <p> At first sight it is strange to see such a very hard-headed and deflationary thinker growing so apparently high-flown. She is, for example, a considerable fan of James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis, as much because of its religious potential as because of its scientific truth. But of course the idea that the universe could be deflated down to the facts is one she has constantly fought against. We could not begin to understand a world that was made of facts and nothing else; such a world is itself an imaginative vision and not a scientific one. </p> <p> It seems odd, though, that she can nowhere articulate her positive ideas with nearly as much stirring precision as she can do the demolition job. In person it is obvious that she loves company, family, and the fun of talking with live ammunition. Her house in a leafy suburb of Newcastle, where she has lived for nearly 50 years, has a comfortable litter of books around a shiny white computer - nothing else is brighter than the gas fire. Sitting in an upright chair in front of the fire, with one leg stretched out on the footstool, she seems to radiate contentment and a capacity for affection in an almost cat-like fashion, yet, like a cat, when she stretches comfortable, the claws appear as well. </p> <p> \"I keep thinking that I shall have no more to say - and then finding some wonderfully idiotic doctrine which I can contradict - a negative approach, as they say, but one that doesn\u00cdt seem to run out.\" </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> September 13 1919, London.<br> <strong>Education:</strong> Downe House School, Berkshire; Somerville College Oxford.<br> <strong>Married: </strong> 1950 Geoffrey Midgley, (three sons - Tom, David, Martin; three grandchildren - two boys, one girl).<br> <strong>Employment: </strong> Senior lecturer in philosophy, Newcastle University, 1962-1980.<br> <strong>Publications: </strong> Beast And Man 1978, Science And Salvation 1992, Wickedness 1984, Evolution As A Religion 1985, Animals And Why They Matter 1983, Heart And Mind 1981, The Ethical Primate 1994, Science And Poetry 2001.<br></p> <p>\u0095 Science And Poetry by Mary Midgley is published by Routledge in March, price \u00a319.99.</p>",

But, of course, since we are a species of animal, we too must have inherited predispositions and these will shape the ways we understand the world, and things we can hope to get out of it. These are not ideas which would have appeared strange to any philosopher until about 1900. Since then it has been almost axiomatic that philosophy has nothing very authoritative to say about how we should live. When Midgley got interested in the question in the early 70s, it was unusual enough to get her invited for a year to Cornell University. Out of that came Beast And Man. \"I wrote no books until I was a good 50, and I'm jolly glad because I didn\u00cdt know what I thought before then; if I had been an academic I would have had to publish, whether I knew what I thought or not. The idea that in philosophy or English you can have 16 new ideas a year is ridiculous.\" For a lot of the 20th century it was a precondition of respectable psychology to pretend that consciousness was an illusion; and in philosophy, questions of purpose had come to seem illegitimate or outside the scope of the business, just as they were in science. But recognising that human beings are a sort of animal lets these questions of purpose back in. At the same time, Darwinism was enabling scientists to ask the question \"what are things for\" and get answers that looked scientific as well as philosophical. The convergence of so many different lines of enquiry on these questions was unfortunate. When the humanists met the scientists, the middle ground was churned into a muddy no-man's-land of controversy, where only the bravest dared change their position by scuttling between shell holes and opponents' positions were illuminated only to make it easier to fire on them. John Cornwell, the writer and director of the science and religion project at Jesus College Cambridge, says, \"Mary is an excellent thing, of course. Whenever you look for a debate, she is the natural against the ultra-Darwinists, like Richard Dawkins or Dan Dennett. But although she often professes to be talking about science, she does draw an equivalence between scientism [applying scientific method inappropriately] and science. I think a lot of the stuff she does is very good knockabout, which pleases people who don't like science, and she tends to lump together an enormous amount in her criticisms. \"I tackled her once exactly on this point about confusing scientism with science, at a conference I organised. It was in the evening down in the college bar: she had collected a gang of groupies, and when I had finished, she declared to the audience, 'is Cornwell drunk?'. She's very feisty. I was entirely sober: but just for making this point against her, I got the treatment. She's a daunting opponent, and she does go as close to playing dirty as you can get.\" With all that said, Midgley remains surrounded by affection, described by many as \"an excellent ting\". As Philippa Foot says, \"She's raised three splendid foals, and so on. She's very much someone who is very successful in family life.\" Steven Rose, the professor of biology at the Open University, attended her 80th birthday party: \"We only learnt that there was an enormous circle of people who would meet round at her house when we went up there. She was simply surrounded with affection and respect. Yet she is formidable. She's incapable of being stopped once she's started. \"She was on a radio programme once with John Gribbin [the physicist and writer], and eventually her patience burst. So she put her hand over her eyes, closed her eyes, and turned away; then she launched into a tremendous denunciation. Melvyn Bragg, who was presenting the show was enchanted and frustrated by it because of course he couldn\u00cdt catch her eye or signal to her.\" The vehement clashes on such occasions are not scientific or factual at all. It's true that Midgley misunderstood the early work of Richard Dawkins and took violent offence at its use as justification for bad philosophical positions; he in turn took undying umbrage at what she had written, but those disputes are in part the kind of misunderstanding that might have been sorted out if the participants could sit down and talk. The bitter question has become an insoluble one of academic competence, part of the war between science and the humanities. Midgley feels that modern scientists, though they have realised what the urgent problems of the human race are, still talk as if science, or simply increasing knowledge, could solve them. But \"If there is one thing that we know from the long and hard experience of the human race, it is that what is wrong is not simple.\" She started off much more horrified, she says, by the stupidity of her own tribe, the humanists and sociologists, who believed that human nature was either uninteresting or non-existent; and that if it did exist, it could be moulded into any shape we wanted. One place where this was a real problem was feminism: the question do women differ from men only in the position of their dangly bits, or in their hearts and minds too, is not purely academic. Science, philosophy and ethics all can help to solve it, but that is not what makes it urgent. It's interesting because it is a question that everyone must solve in their own lives, and which various academic disciplines can help them to solve. Those have always been the kind of questions that interest Midgley. But now that everyone is more or less a sociobiologist, or Darwinian in polite society, what really distinguishes her controversial position is the idea that pre-Darwinian ideas of human nature are likely to be just as accurate and a great deal more revealing than whatever the latest pop-science best-seller tells us. There are times when she seems to be reacting to the imperialisms of science with her own just as determined imperialism: in Science And Poetry she returns to her roots as a Latin scholar, and traces a lot of the philosophical mistakes committed by modern scientists all the way back to the pagan Roman poet Lucretius: \"It was Lucretius,\"she writes, \"who launched the notion of science as primarily a benign kind of weedkiller designed to get rid of religion, and did it in great rolling passionate hexameters which gave it a force it would never have had if it had been expressed in unemotive prose. \"I am not saying that the atomic theory would never have emerged in science if it had not had those particular philosophical and poetic roots in ancient Rome. I am saying that, if the theory had had different roots, it would not have brought with it this particular word-picture, this myth, this drama, this way of accommodating science in the range of human activities, this notion of what it is to have a scientific attitude (it would no doubt have brought a different one).\" Such assertions are anathema to the kind of scientist who believes that his theories arise strictly from the facts. Certainly, it doesn't account for the developments of science which postulate things we literally cannot picture, such as modern particle physics. But it certainly explains the way in which phrases that can have a strict scientific meaning, such as \"genes for something\" can spread in the wider culture with meanings that would horrify the scientists involved if they thought them important. But of course few do. For most, the metaphors in which their theories are described really are no more significant than the tulips in front of a nuclear power station, whereas she sees metaphorical thought as the ground on which even nuclear power stations are built. This is in part a consequence of her attitude to religion. Though she is not any sort of Christian, believing that too many of the essential doctrines of Christianity are impossible for a decent and educated person to subscribe to, she remains convinced that the religions of the world can't simply be superseded because we don't like them. \"It is absurd to talk as if religion consisted entirely of mindless anxiety, bad cosmology, and human sacrifice.\" There is a sense of rather Victorian moral astringency about her that preserves the high-minded and disciplined attitudes that led privileged Oxford youth to see the Communist party as a kind of church. \"It is an extraordinary thing to say of someone that they cannot control a character flaw\", she once said about the certainties of one her opponents; and she meant it, whereas nowadays it is more common to find it remarkable when anyone does manage to overcome a failing. The great thing to be said for organised religion, she believes is precisely that it is not disorganised. \"People are naturally ceremonial, ritualistic, and naturally inclined to find purposes in things. If these impulses are not brought together and disciplined, you get something even worse than organised religion. I feel this about the Guardian's anti-royal campaign. If you don't have your ceremonial life centred on royalty, you've got it centred on pop stars, and that's worse. It's all a matter of the lesser evil.\" This fierce sense that organised religion has learned from its own mistakes fired her two shortest and perhaps most enjoyable books, Science As Salvation and Evolution As A Religion. These systematically dissect the ways in which much modern science simply assumes that scientists have the same kind of function in a scientific universe as priests had in a religiously motivated one, and the idiocies that follow from this assumption. For instance, there are plenty of theologians who believe that God made creatures so they could know him and love him. That is a ridiculous claim on its own, but what are we to make of the remark by two prominent physicists that \"a physicist is an atom\u00cds way of knowing about an atom?\" She uses that as a classic example of folie de grandeur and adds: \"It should surely be obvious that, if the universe is the kind of thing capable of knowing or wanting to know anything, it can do this on its own, and does not need help from physicists.\" For all the obvious difficulties about believing in God, or in anything else that might answer our prayers, Midgley points out that prayer has been immensely important in history: \"People have achieved the most amazing things by putting their trust in providence, or indeed by praying. They were not thinking about the virgin birth or the atonement when they did that. But they were thinking in a way that does seem central to human effort. I think it is reasonable to say that one can think that way with respect to the creation as a whole. All the formulations that one makes about this have something wrong with them, and it is very easy to say that there is something wrong with them; but that\u00cds not to say that we can live without the religious attitude.\" At first sight it is strange to see such a very hard-headed and deflationary thinker growing so apparently high-flown. She is, for example, a considerable fan of James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis, as much because of its religious potential as because of its scientific truth. But of course the idea that the universe could be deflated down to the facts is one she has constantly fought against. We could not begin to understand a world that was made of facts and nothing else; such a world is itself an imaginative vision and not a scientific one. It seems odd, though, that she can nowhere articulate her positive ideas with nearly as much stirring precision as she can do the demolition job. In person it is obvious that she loves company, family, and the fun of talking with live ammunition. Her house in a leafy suburb of Newcastle, where she has lived for nearly 50 years, has a comfortable litter of books around a shiny white computer - nothing else is brighter than the gas fire. Sitting in an upright chair in front of the fire, with one leg stretched out on the footstool, she seems to radiate contentment and a capacity for affection in an almost cat-like fashion, yet, like a cat, when she stretches comfortable, the claws appear as well. \"I keep thinking that I shall have no more to say - and then finding some wonderfully idiotic doctrine which I can contradict - a negative approach, as they say, but one that doesn\u00cdt seem to run out.\" Life at a glance Born: September 13 1919, London.

Zimbabwe, Zaire (as was) and Russia also score highly in the nose-in-the-trough stakes. But it has rarely been seen on the scale practised by the late General Abacha, who along with other members of his kleptocracy stole $2.2bn from the Central Bank during their time in power. Abacha died in the arms of a couple of Indian prostitutes, an event which Karl Maier describes as \"a coup from heaven\". </p> <p>In This House has Fallen: Nigeria in Crisis Maier relates a shocking litany of statistics: \"Literacy is below that of the Democratic Republic of Congo... Gross domestic product per person is lower than the 1970s... The navy's 52 admirals and commodores outnumber serviceable ships by a ratio of six to one. The airforce has 10,000 men but fewer than 20 functioning aircraft.\" And so on. Maier pauses for breath, then says: \"The facts speak for themselves.\" Well, not quite. It is not the facts that make this a fascinating book, but the sheer weight of voices competing to win the post-rationalisation contest, the analysis of what has happened to Nigeria since independence. Ex-heads of state (Babangida), tribal leaders (Ojukwu) and popular rabble-rousers (Adams) are all given a platform to justify their actions and put forward their heavily partisan analysis. </p> <p>The only common thread among these jockeying voices is an unwillingness to admit mistakes or to give any ideological quarter to the perceived enemy. Maier's own summation is blunt: \"a non-productive economy addicted to petrodollars, ruled by a coterie of army officers and bureaucrats growing fat on contract kickbacks and siphoning off the oil revenues\". </p> <p>It is all true. In the 1980s the 469 members of the National Assembly voted themselves $25-35,000 each in furniture allowance at a time when the minimum monthly wage stood at $30, which makes Lord Irvine's redecoration seem as prosaic as a trip to IKEA. Maier's thesis, that Nigeria has been sucked dry of resources and denied economic growth through successive rapacious administrations, is a hard one to refute. </p> <p>He beats his depressing tattoo over 300 anecdote-rich pages. Nigeria has become a bureaucracy in its purest form, where bloated state administrations are there to serve themselves exclusively. The most prized jobs for university graduates are in customs and excise, primarily for the scope for self-enrichment they afford. The reason we do not accurately know the population of Nigeria is not an inability to count but because national revenues (mainly from oil) are distributed to individual states according to size of population. Therefore it is in the states' interest to inflate census figures. </p> <p>Understandably, this kind of thing angers the inhabitants of less densely populated regions such as Ogoniland. It is worth pointing out that the well-reported localised struggles there are to a large extent a variation on a wider pattern of exploitation and greed. The drive to impose Sharia (Islamic) law in the Hausa-dominated states has far greater implications for the survival of Nigeria. The overlay of tribal law, British common law and Sharia law creates its own tensions, as Maier explains: \"The wife of... Gideon Akaluka (an Igbo trader) was accused of desecrating the Koran by allegedly using its pages as toilet paper for her baby. The police detained Akaluka for his own protection. But militants broke into the jail, killed Akaluka, and led a procession around Kano with his severed head on a pole.\" The spark to this chain of events was the fact that the woman was illiterate. </p> <p>The Sharia question is not an arcane legal issue but a tribal and political one. What makes the incident in Kano additionally unforgivable is that in the Hausa-dominated north, unless you are one of the elite, there is the perception that schooling is forbidden. The suppression of universal education is now seen as a legitimate tool for retaining power. A local commentator remarks that: \"People have been imbued with the notion that Sharia is the answer to their frustration with life. These politicians want to use Sharia as a cover because the upper class in the north has come to the end of the line.\" </p> <p>Beyond Maier's gloomy analysis, the book is a rather entertaining hybrid of political travel writing covering several different visits during which he seeks audiences with the political protagonists of the day at both local and national levels. Maier's volume itself becomes an accumulation of \"stories\", a catalogue of indignities imposed by the powerful on the weak, Igbo over Ibo, Hausa over Yoruba, military over civilian. We follow him as he travels through what are in effect war zones in order to get a more balanced view of the political situation. </p> <p>So whose fault is it? In Home and Exile, a slim series of lectures mainly concerned with cultural appropriation, Chinua Achebe fastidiously unpacks the construct that is \"history\". Paraphrasing an Ibo proverb, he wryly states that \"until the lions produce their own historian, the story of the hunt will only glorify the hunter\". </p> <p>Once more it is a question of competing voices. Elspeth Huxley's White Man's Country is described as \"the best apologia for white settlement that has been written\". Despite the gracious tone, Achebe cannot help but accuse her of \"spinning stories to validate the transfer of African lands to white settlers\". In contrast, Maier seems mostly to absolve the west of any culpability in Nigeria's present situation, as though her problems only started several years after independence in 1960. He is perhaps too generous to the colonials. </p> <p>It is not insignificant that Achebe describes himself as an Ibo and not Nigerian. Even a Nobel laureate cannot help falling into the language of the tribe: \"Conventional practice would call them a tribe, but I no longer follow that convention. I call them a nation.\" </p> <p>Is there the political and social will to keep the country in its current form? Is grab-it-while-you-can Nigeria really, as a newspaper editor in Port Harcourt has it, \"the land of no tomorrow\"? Maier concludes that for all its faults -including the failure to produce a single piece of significant legislation in seven months in office - Obasanjo's government represents the last chance to establish enough political and economic stability to avoid the breakup of the country and in some way to reverse the excessive factionalism and corruption that has taken place over the past 40 years. If Obasanjo does not survive the next few years, neither will Nigeria as it is now. </p> <p>Maier vividly encapsulates the challenge ahead and the apparent incompatibility of behaviour with aspirational rhetoric. The contrast becomes clear in one eyewitness vignette of the inauguration of Obasanjo, where he juxtaposes the high-sounding rhetoric of the inaugural speech with the looting of celebratory knick-knacks and trinkets on sale a few yards away.</p>",

Ex-heads of state (Babangida), tribal leaders (Ojukwu) and popular rabble-rousers (Adams) are all given a platform to justify their actions and put forward their heavily partisan analysis. The only common thread among these jockeying voices is an unwillingness to admit mistakes or to give any ideological quarter to the perceived enemy. Maier's own summation is blunt: \"a non-productive economy addicted to petrodollars, ruled by a coterie of army officers and bureaucrats growing fat on contract kickbacks and siphoning off the oil revenues\". It is all true. In the 1980s the 469 members of the National Assembly voted themselves $25-35,000 each in furniture allowance at a time when the minimum monthly wage stood at $30, which makes Lord Irvine's redecoration seem as prosaic as a trip to IKEA. Maier's thesis, that Nigeria has been sucked dry of resources and denied economic growth through successive rapacious administrations, is a hard one to refute. He beats his depressing tattoo over 300 anecdote-rich pages. Nigeria has become a bureaucracy in its purest form, where bloated state administrations are there to serve themselves exclusively. The most prized jobs for university graduates are in customs and excise, primarily for the scope for self-enrichment they afford. The reason we do not accurately know the population of Nigeria is not an inability to count but because national revenues (mainly from oil) are distributed to individual states according to size of population. Therefore it is in the states' interest to inflate census figures. Understandably, this kind of thing angers the inhabitants of less densely populated regions such as Ogoniland. It is worth pointing out that the well-reported localised struggles there are to a large extent a variation on a wider pattern of exploitation and greed. The drive to impose Sharia (Islamic) law in the Hausa-dominated states has far greater implications for the survival of Nigeria. The overlay of tribal law, British common law and Sharia law creates its own tensions, as Maier explains: \"The wife of... Gideon Akaluka (an Igbo trader) was accused of desecrating the Koran by allegedly using its pages as toilet paper for her baby. The police detained Akaluka for his own protection. But militants broke into the jail, killed Akaluka, and led a procession around Kano with his severed head on a pole.\" The spark to this chain of events was the fact that the woman was illiterate. The Sharia question is not an arcane legal issue but a tribal and political one. What makes the incident in Kano additionally unforgivable is that in the Hausa-dominated north, unless you are one of the elite, there is the perception that schooling is forbidden. The suppression of universal education is now seen as a legitimate tool for retaining power. A local commentator remarks that: \"People have been imbued with the notion that Sharia is the answer to their frustration with life. These politicians want to use Sharia as a cover because the upper class in the north has come to the end of the line.\" Beyond Maier's gloomy analysis, the book is a rather entertaining hybrid of political travel writing covering several different visits during which he seeks audiences with the political protagonists of the day at both local and national levels. Maier's volume itself becomes an accumulation of \"stories\", a catalogue of indignities imposed by the powerful on the weak, Igbo over Ibo, Hausa over Yoruba, military over civilian. We follow him as he travels through what are in effect war zones in order to get a more balanced view of the political situation. So whose fault is it? In Home and Exile, a slim series of lectures mainly concerned with cultural appropriation, Chinua Achebe fastidiously unpacks the construct that is \"history\". Paraphrasing an Ibo proverb, he wryly states that \"until the lions produce their own historian, the story of the hunt will only glorify the hunter\". Once more it is a question of competing voices. Elspeth Huxley's White Man's Country is described as \"the best apologia for white settlement that has been written\". Despite the gracious tone, Achebe cannot help but accuse her of \"spinning stories to validate the transfer of African lands to white settlers\". In contrast, Maier seems mostly to absolve the west of any culpability in Nigeria's present situation, as though her problems only started several years after independence in 1960. He is perhaps too generous to the colonials. It is not insignificant that Achebe describes himself as an Ibo and not Nigerian. Even a Nobel laureate cannot help falling into the language of the tribe: \"Conventional practice would call them a tribe, but I no longer follow that convention. I call them a nation.\" Is there the political and social will to keep the country in its current form? Is grab-it-while-you-can Nigeria really, as a newspaper editor in Port Harcourt has it, \"the land of no tomorrow\"? Maier concludes that for all its faults -including the failure to produce a single piece of significant legislation in seven months in office - Obasanjo's government represents the last chance to establish enough political and economic stability to avoid the breakup of the country and in some way to reverse the excessive factionalism and corruption that has taken place over the past 40 years. If Obasanjo does not survive the next few years, neither will Nigeria as it is now. Maier vividly encapsulates the challenge ahead and the apparent incompatibility of behaviour with aspirational rhetoric. The contrast becomes clear in one eyewitness vignette of the inauguration of Obasanjo, where he juxtaposes the high-sounding rhetoric of the inaugural speech with the looting of celebratory knick-knacks and trinkets on sale a few yards away.",

In sleep, dreamers may have the experience of being able to direct events, of having already woken up, or of returning again and again to a particular place. Out of these disparate and disorienting facts, Russell Hoban has constructed a compelling meditation on the nature of loss and longing that, even after the final piece of the jigsaw slots into place, leaves us with enough unresolved mysteries to fill another book. </p> <p> Hoban's last novel, Angelica's Grotto, ended with its hero crushed under the wheels of a number 14 bus.

He recoils for an instant, and wakes up. Not so easily accommodated in the comforting gloss of reality is the arrival of the same young woman as he peruses Klein bottles in the Science Museum the following day.

Freighted with allusions to high art and low culture, alternately jokey and portentous, it proceeds in associative fashion, each pas sage spewing another half-finished staircase that might lead into thin air. At times one has the impression Hoban writes merely for himself, but watching his ludic mind is pleasure enough for the most exacting reader. </p> <p>The novel is a dreamscape in which gnomic utterances, mis-said and misheard words and frightful journeys become commonplace.

Diggs's feverish wanderings call to mind another dreamy writer, de Quincey, who searched \"the mighty labyrinths of London\" all his life for a prostitute who had fetched him food and drink. Diggs, a painter entrapped by aesthetic sensibility, is also searching for a woman, \"the image of a beauty who beckoned but was unattainable\". In Hoban's oneiric fable, Diggs's task is to discover whether he wants a woman rather than an image. If so, who will it be? And will she want him back?

By explaining how Americans have been seduced and coerced during the 1990s into accepting the free market as the perfect way of arranging human affairs, and by showing just how absurd and vulnerable this view of the world has become, Frank means to give us a warning. As with No Logo, there is a presumption here: that North America is the most important place on earth, and that criticisms of its particularly harsh brand of capitalism can be beneficially exported and absorbed elsewhere, like Coca-Cola. This may be slightly galling to people in countries with more pronounced traditions of scepticism about business; but the fact that Frank and Klein have had their spiky thoughts put between smart covers and distributed globally is reason to read them.

But then, with the end of the cold war, the first public enthusiasm for the internet and the discovery that great profits could be made from youth culture, the corporations saw an opportunity to make themselves seem more heroic, more popular, younger. They enlisted any ideas they could: the rosy predictions of eccentric futurists, the pseudo-religious promises of management literature, the useful enthusiasm of cultural-studies professors for everyday products. </p> <p>The next step was to turn reality on its head. With the willing help of the American media, itself increasingly owned and steered by big business, prosperous company heads repositioned themselves as \"rebels\". Working for them became \"being yourself\"; making money became \"revolutionary\"; and opposing any of this became \"elitist\" and \"old-fashioned\". The language and postures of radicalism and hipness were shamelessly adopted by a private sector that was actually growing more conformist, with longer working hours, a cautious emphasis on market research and share options for managers so they had an interest in minimising costs. Beneath the brightening tints of photos of entrepreneurs in magazines like Wired, the pale faces of workaholics were masked. </p> <p>Frank lists examples of this craze for economic euphemisms with a mixture of horrified amazement and scorn.

Not just among investors when the good times stop, not just among the panicking share dealers we are traditionally supposed to feel sorry for, but among people for whom even a \"boom\" is actually a bust: the exhausted Californian cheap labour in hidden sub-contractors' sheds in Silicon Valley or the assassinated union leaders in poor countries (Frank counts 3,000 in Columbia alone since 1987) where western companies are so keen to set up. While modern politicians and economists talk about our money \"frolicking open-mindedly through the economies of the world, chasing the best return without regard for color or creed,\" writes Frank witheringly, \"what ensured those [1990s] returns was not the 'inevitability' of the microchip but the guns and the muscle and the hard unanswering face of economic power.\" </p> <p>He makes a good moralist; you can imagine him rabble-rousing from some rough stage in a small town around 1900. There is a nostalgia here, and in The Baffler too, for such times when magnates were \"robber barons\" and the economic order was up for public discussion. But Frank's analysis of and attack on the much more complacent 1990s is thoroughly modern. Hopefully the odd anxious business guru or banker will come across it and repent, or at least go quiet for a while.</p>",

Not just among investors when the good times stop, not just among the panicking share dealers we are traditionally supposed to feel sorry for, but among people for whom even a \"boom\" is actually a bust: the exhausted Californian cheap labour in hidden sub-contractors' sheds in Silicon Valley or the assassinated union leaders in poor countries (Frank counts 3,000 in Columbia alone since 1987) where western companies are so keen to set up. While modern politicians and economists talk about our money \"frolicking open-mindedly through the economies of the world, chasing the best return without regard for color or creed,\" writes Frank witheringly, \"what ensured those [1990s] returns was not the 'inevitability' of the microchip but the guns and the muscle and the hard unanswering face of economic power.\" He makes a good moralist; you can imagine him rabble-rousing from some rough stage in a small town around 1900. There is a nostalgia here, and in The Baffler too, for such times when magnates were \"robber barons\" and the economic order was up for public discussion. But Frank's analysis of and attack on the much more complacent 1990s is thoroughly modern. Hopefully the odd anxious business guru or banker will come across it and repent, or at least go quiet for a while.",

This is the case with David Macey's biography of Frantz Fanon, the man who passionately articulated the cause of Algerian independence and excoriated French racism in his The Year V of the Algerian Revolution (1959) and The Wretched of the Earth (1961). A few weeks ago, after a 40-year silence, General Paul Aussaresses, the counter- espionage chief charged in 1957 with \"dismantling\" the FLN (Algerian National Liberation Front), decided at the age of 82 to unburden himself and confess to Le Monde that torture and summary execution were routine in the operation against the Algerian population. </p> <p>He made it clear that the commander of the French forces in Algeria at the time, General Jacques Massu (later de Gaulle's right-hand man during the May events of 1968), was well aware of what was happening. In June, Massu himself expressed vague regret: \"When I think of Algeria I am very sorry,\" he said. \"We could have done things differently.\" Until 1999 the French did not even admit that there had been a war in Algeria; officially it was a peace-keeping operation in a French province. But over the past few months debate has raged in France over the \"officers who left their soul\" in Algeria. </p> <p>Fanon was in the best position to know their souls. Remembered, if at all, as a kind of Che Guevara of the Algerian independence war, this powerful voice of the anti-colonial movement that swept Africa and Asia in the late 1950s and 1960s was also a respected psychiatrist whose patients in his Algerian clinic included French soldiers. In The Wretched of the Earth, Fanon recorded anonymously the confessions of patients who had been army torturers, distressed by their own activities. Although already in the FLN, Fanon, whose advocacy of violence against the colonisers had almost mystical overtones, never betrayed these men. </p> <p>Macey's Fanon is a hugely complex figure. One could fear that the author of a life of Jacques Lacan might, in emphasising the psychiatrist side of an over-mythologised revolutionary, be using a gimmick to freshen up his subject. But Fanon's background in psychiatry was central to his life. It was also the path that, having first treated Algerian victims of oppression in Lyon, led him directly to active revolt. Eventually he had to leave his hospital and take refuge in Tunis. </p> <p>There are superficial contradictions in Fanon's character. He was not Algerian, but a black native of Martinique, also a d\u00e9partement of France. It was only in the last years of his life that he adopted the Algerian identity, but his vision always embraced vengeful triumph of oppressed peoples. He was also a decorated hero of the French army during the second world war, a matter he preferred not to discuss. By the end of that war it was clear to him that he could expect nothing from France: racism in the army gave no quarter to decorated black soldiers. </p> <p>In Algeria he discovered \"racism with scientific pretensions\" and found that French psychiatrists there were willing to provide scientific justification for torture as a peace-keeping tool. Of course, he himself was a prophet of the cleansing and liberating effect of violence (and the FLN were guilty of major atrocities), but not just as a guerrilla fighter. \"Nationalisation,\" he wrote, \"simply means the transfer into native hands of those unfair advantages which are a legacy of the colonial period.\" His call to violence found an echo among black Americans and briefly terrified the State Department. When he died, aged 37, of leukaemia, his body had to be smuggled 15km across the Tunisian border in order to honour his wish to be buried in Algerian ground. Seven months later, Algeria's independence was formally declared. </p> <p>But Fanon died a second death. Macey points out that a black agnostic was not a convenient hero for a Muslim state; he is not on the official list of Algerian war heroes. As the French now agonise over their past, a question arises for us.

      "bodyText": "Frantz Fanon: A Life David Macey 651pp, Granta, \u00a325 Buy it at a discount at BOL Occasionally a book appears at an optimum moment through a simple caprice. This is the case with David Macey's biography of Frantz Fanon, the man who passionately articulated the cause of Algerian independence and excoriated French racism in his The Year V of the Algerian Revolution (1959) and The Wretched of the Earth (1961). A few weeks ago, after a 40-year silence, General Paul Aussaresses, the counter- espionage chief charged in 1957 with \"dismantling\" the FLN (Algerian National Liberation Front), decided at the age of 82 to unburden himself and confess to Le Monde that torture and summary execution were routine in the operation against the Algerian population. He made it clear that the commander of the French forces in Algeria at the time, General Jacques Massu (later de Gaulle's right-hand man during the May events of 1968), was well aware of what was happening. In June, Massu himself expressed vague regret: \"When I think of Algeria I am very sorry,\" he said. \"We could have done things differently.\" Until 1999 the French did not even admit that there had been a war in Algeria; officially it was a peace-keeping operation in a French province. But over the past few months debate has raged in France over the \"officers who left their soul\" in Algeria. Fanon was in the best position to know their souls. Remembered, if at all, as a kind of Che Guevara of the Algerian independence war, this powerful voice of the anti-colonial movement that swept Africa and Asia in the late 1950s and 1960s was also a respected psychiatrist whose patients in his Algerian clinic included French soldiers. In The Wretched of the Earth, Fanon recorded anonymously the confessions of patients who had been army torturers, distressed by their own activities. Although already in the FLN, Fanon, whose advocacy of violence against the colonisers had almost mystical overtones, never betrayed these men. Macey's Fanon is a hugely complex figure. One could fear that the author of a life of Jacques Lacan might, in emphasising the psychiatrist side of an over-mythologised revolutionary, be using a gimmick to freshen up his subject. But Fanon's background in psychiatry was central to his life. It was also the path that, having first treated Algerian victims of oppression in Lyon, led him directly to active revolt. Eventually he had to leave his hospital and take refuge in Tunis. There are superficial contradictions in Fanon's character. He was not Algerian, but a black native of Martinique, also a d\u00e9partement of France. It was only in the last years of his life that he adopted the Algerian identity, but his vision always embraced vengeful triumph of oppressed peoples. He was also a decorated hero of the French army during the second world war, a matter he preferred not to discuss. By the end of that war it was clear to him that he could expect nothing from France: racism in the army gave no quarter to decorated black soldiers. In Algeria he discovered \"racism with scientific pretensions\" and found that French psychiatrists there were willing to provide scientific justification for torture as a peace-keeping tool. Of course, he himself was a prophet of the cleansing and liberating effect of violence (and the FLN were guilty of major atrocities), but not just as a guerrilla fighter. \"Nationalisation,\" he wrote, \"simply means the transfer into native hands of those unfair advantages which are a legacy of the colonial period.\" His call to violence found an echo among black Americans and briefly terrified the State Department. When he died, aged 37, of leukaemia, his body had to be smuggled 15km across the Tunisian border in order to honour his wish to be buried in Algerian ground. Seven months later, Algeria's independence was formally declared. But Fanon died a second death. Macey points out that a black agnostic was not a convenient hero for a Muslim state; he is not on the official list of Algerian war heroes. As the French now agonise over their past, a question arises for us. During those crucial years from 1957 to 1961, while the world marvelled at France's cultural prowess - the nouvelle vague , the \"new novel\", vibrant theatre - France was conducting a continuous campaign of torture and atrocities that knew no restraints (entire villages were wiped out) and was officially sanctioned. And not only in Algeria. While the Right Bank offered tourists the Folies Berg\u00e8re , the police torture chambers of the Goutte d'Or at the back of the Gare du Nord were only 15 minutes away. A theatregoer who absentmindedly forgot to get off at the right stop for the Left Bank Od\u00e9on theatre might travel a few stations to the Porte d'Orl\u00e9ans, where more powerful dramas were being conducted in a police torture centre. The torture chambers were well known in Paris: the editor of La Nouvelle Observateur and a councillor at the Porte d'Orl\u00e9ans protested; Beckett's publisher, Jerome Lindon, published testimonies of torture and was continually raided by the police. Distinguished journalists on Le Monde issued wise, measured and ineffectual rebukes. But it is in the behaviour of the outside world that the ultimate justification of Fanon's rage against the white world in general will be found. Any non-white country that regularly committed the atrocities the French committed month after month, year after year, would, as a matter of simple reflex, have become a pariah. Why did France escape censure? The answer must be that whether by indifference or diplomatic discretion, the media and institutions of all western countries practise racism as a matter of course when it concerns the wretched of the earth.",

He seems hard to place. His poems are, for the moment, in a kind of administrative limbo from which not every writer emerges. Yet Graves (1895-1985) was a very prominent figure, with a readership extending far beyond the poetry audience. He was also a bestselling historical novelist (I, Claudius), the author of an autobiographical classic of the first world war (Goodbye to All That) and an idiosyncratic interpreter of mythology (The White Goddess, found on every good psychedelic bookshelf, was the unwitting progenetrix of a good deal of New Age mystification). </p> <p>Certainly Graves would have viewed all these works as subordinate to his poetry, although they did much to subsidise it, but it is a fair bet that the prose is now much more widely read.

For all its folktale violence of gesture, the verse often has a domesticated, anaesthetic quality, as if providing the imagination with a period of convalescence following the horrors recounted in Goodbye to All That. Mistakenly reported dead in action, for years afterwards Graves found himself greeted by dead comrades: <br></p> <p> You grin at me from daylight places, <br></p> <p>Dead, long dead, I'm ashamed to greet <br></p> <p>Dead men down the morning street. <br></p> <p>But on the whole, the war is more effectively handled in the novel. </p> <p>Graves underwent breakdown and psychoanalysis in the effort to come to terms with his experience. Dismissive of what appeared to be merely scientific knowledge, he was nonetheless a seeker after systems that could negotiate between the self and its inner and outer terrors. \"The Cool Web\", among the best of the early poems, considers the relationship between language and experience in the light of his own poetic practice. If the domesticating fireguard of language is removed, then </p> <p> Facing the wide glare of the children's day, <br></p> <p>Facing the rose, the dark sky and the drums <br></p> <p>We shall go mad no doubt and die that way. <br></p> <p>Graves paid careful attention to some features of modernism, and collaborated with his formidable mistress and teacher Laura Riding on A Survey of Modernist Poetry (1926). However, while he had, like Eliot, Pound and Yeats, the arrogance and the mythological impedimenta needed to focus the poems, his verse seems to find little value in the overt friction between the poetic imagination and the historical moment that proved so productive for those other poets. Lyric is his beginning and ending. </p> <p>Instead of history, Graves has the still marble pool of mythology, by which he awaits the next encounter with the inspiring but destructive powers of the White Goddess, \"Whom we desired above all things to know,/ Sister of the mirage and the echo.\" A true poem, he wrote, \"is necessarily an invocation of the White Goddess, or Muse, the Mother of All Living, the ancient power of fright and lust - the female spider or queen-bee whose embrace is death\". </p> <p>The Muse would take up temporary residence in successive actually existing women, who might individually contain several other mythic identities (in one case Andromeda, Niobe and Helen), but Her truth remained the same. She would demand all from her acolyte/lover and at the last yield nothing, except poems: \"So each new victim treads unerringly/ the never-altered circle of his fate.\" Whatever you make of the contraption, Graves derived some very powerful work from a struggle that has as much to do with the problem of consciousness as with sexuality. The famous Chinese box poem, \"Warning to Children\", seductively and chillingly foretells what knowledge of the world will be like: <br></p> <p> For who dares undo the parcel <br></p> <p>Finds himself at once inside it, <br></p> <p>On the island, in the fruit, <br></p> <p>Blocks of slate about his head ... <br></p> <p>The attraction to pattern and repetition, unusually powerful even for a poet, is handled in more adult terms in \"Ulysses\", a poem that seems like a template for the work of many succeeding poets, including figures as various as Thom Gunn, Fleur Adcock and Michael Longley. Gunn's acerbic confidence surely owes something to these lines: <br></p> <p> To the much-tossed Ulysses, never done <br></p> <p>With woman whether gowned as wife or whore, <br></p> <p>Penelope and Circe seemed as one: <br></p> <p>She like a whore made his lewd fancies run, <br></p> <p>And wifely she a hero to him bore. <br></p> <p>Readers are likely to divide at this point, not only about sexual politics but also about matters of authority and cultural baggage. As Graves's poetry achieved acclaim in the post-war years, those who might seem like his poetic enemies also began their ascent. Among them was Larkin, an avowed opponent of the \"myth-kitty\", who wrote \"I really think I dislike [Graves] more than ever I disliked Dylan [Thomas]\". Everything in Graves's description of the genesis of a poem seems designed to draw sceptical fire: \"The nucleus of every poem worth the name is rhythmically formed in the poet's mind, during a trance-like suspension of his normal habits of thought, by the supra-logical reconciliation of conflicting emotional ideas.\" \"In a pig's arse, friend,\" Larkin might have replied - except that the dialectical form of much of his own work bears out Graves's admittedly elevated description. </p> <p>Neither poet was in the habit of ingratiating himself with the public, and both were idiosyncratic and powerful formalists. Given these points of contact, why is Larkin the more widely read poet now? Is it because he suits an audience without a classical education? Partly. But it also goes back to attitudes to history: Larkin's instinct to preserve the odds and ends of life as well as its defining moments holds a stronger appeal in a period of flux and alarm than Graves's devotion to the cycles of mythology. In The Oxford Book of English Verse, Larkin, like Edward Thomas, gets 10 poems to Graves's seven. This seems about right, but all of them are over-represented in comparison with Yeats and Auden, who were major poets as distinct from poets who sometimes wrote great poems. \"There is one story and one story only,\" Graves said, which is not true; but the resulting love poems, with their continual sense of threat and change, ought to be read alongside playful anthology pieces such as \"The Persian Version\" and \"Welsh Incident\".

Pointing out the potential uplift in sales for a \"solus window promotion\" for 10 days (with a weekend at each end) and promising regular checks of \"branch compliance\", the round-robin email from Waterstone's HQ goes on to solicit what they euphemistically call \"contributions\". If you're an ambitious writer, all you need to do to see your name in lights is persuade your publishers to \"name their best offer\", bearing in mind that Waterstone's \"will not consider any offer of less than \u00a36k\". </p> <p> \u0095 Meanwhile, if you want to earn money rather than spend it and you can dash off a poem of 70 lines or fewer, you might want to enter this year's Strokestown Poetry Prize. The Prize's administrators, undaunted by its lack of celebrity, boldly proclaim it as \"the Louis XIV of prizes\", albeit from \"the E J Thribb of towns\". In fact, obscurity has one bonus: \"The number of entries is still low enough to make winning big money a high probability for an emergent genius.\" To find out more, visit <a href=\"http://www.strokestownpoetryprize.com\">www.strokestownpoetryprize.com</a>, but quickly - the closing date is 23 February. </p> <p> \u0095 A touching tale of aspiration thwarted reaches the Loafer from a dogged reader whose New Year's resolution was to read all six volumes of Proust's In Search of Lost Time. Amazon duly obliged with five - but the first instalment of the mammoth tale has yet to arrive. Better luck next year. </p> <p> \u0095 A lesson in modern marketing for those who need it. A new Penguin Classics edition of Homer's Odyssey is graced by the lovely George Clooney and his co-stars in the film O Brother, Where Art Thou?. The Coen brothers did, it must be said, derive some inspiration from the ancient Greek, but fans expecting more than a passing resemblance to an American all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza might find themselves disappointed. One can only hope it's not a trend, but as the film's slogan has it, \"They have a plan but not a clue ...\" </p> <p> \u0095 From the States comes news that Harvard University Business School Press has paid $250,000 for a mysterious invention code-named \"Ginger\", apparently so ground-breaking that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos claims it will sell itself, Apple chief Steve Jobs thinks it will revolutionise cities, and eager investors are on tenterhooks. Whatever it is, both author and inventor are keeping mum, having mastered, at least, the art of hype.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Roll up, you lucky, lucky people! Waterstone's is offering publishers the unique chance to part with vast sums of money in a lottery-style auction of window space. Pointing out the potential uplift in sales for a \"solus window promotion\" for 10 days (with a weekend at each end) and promising regular checks of \"branch compliance\", the round-robin email from Waterstone's HQ goes on to solicit what they euphemistically call \"contributions\". If you're an ambitious writer, all you need to do to see your name in lights is persuade your publishers to \"name their best offer\", bearing in mind that Waterstone's \"will not consider any offer of less than \u00a36k\". \u0095 Meanwhile, if you want to earn money rather than spend it and you can dash off a poem of 70 lines or fewer, you might want to enter this year's Strokestown Poetry Prize. The Prize's administrators, undaunted by its lack of celebrity, boldly proclaim it as \"the Louis XIV of prizes\", albeit from \"the E J Thribb of towns\". In fact, obscurity has one bonus: \"The number of entries is still low enough to make winning big money a high probability for an emergent genius.\" To find out more, visit www.strokestownpoetryprize.com, but quickly - the closing date is 23 February. \u0095 A touching tale of aspiration thwarted reaches the Loafer from a dogged reader whose New Year's resolution was to read all six volumes of Proust's In Search of Lost Time. Amazon duly obliged with five - but the first instalment of the mammoth tale has yet to arrive. Better luck next year. \u0095 A lesson in modern marketing for those who need it. A new Penguin Classics edition of Homer's Odyssey is graced by the lovely George Clooney and his co-stars in the film O Brother, Where Art Thou?. The Coen brothers did, it must be said, derive some inspiration from the ancient Greek, but fans expecting more than a passing resemblance to an American all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza might find themselves disappointed. One can only hope it's not a trend, but as the film's slogan has it, \"They have a plan but not a clue ...\" \u0095 From the States comes news that Harvard University Business School Press has paid $250,000 for a mysterious invention code-named \"Ginger\", apparently so ground-breaking that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos claims it will sell itself, Apple chief Steve Jobs thinks it will revolutionise cities, and eager investors are on tenterhooks. Whatever it is, both author and inventor are keeping mum, having mastered, at least, the art of hype.",

      "body": "<p>Lorna Sage, who has died in Norwich two days before her 58th birthday, was one of the most brilliant literary critics of her generation. The success of her memoir, Bad Blood, brought her a new readership at the end of her life. But before the book's publication she had established an international reputation as a critic, scholar and writer who made reviewing into her own distinctive art form. </p> <p>She was a charismatic teacher at the University of East Anglia, where she worked from 1965 until her death. Her passion for literature and her learning inspired generations of students who worked with her. She was not a person who needed to be reminded that good teaching is central to the profession of an academic. </p> <p>Sage was born in Hanmer, a village on the English-Welsh border. Her memoir gives a vivid account of her childhood. She learnt early on about the strangeness of families and the value of reading. Initially, she was brought up in the village rectory with her grandparents and her mother. Her grandfather, who lived a life of sexual scandal and frustrated ambition, introduced her to books. Her grandmother introduced her to the secret lives of women. </p> <p>Reading provided an alternative world, a way of living apart in the midst of family turbulence. When her father returned from the second world war, the family moved from the old rectory to a newly-built council house. But the new possibilities presented by postwar reconstruction were shrouded by older patterns of English provincial custom and prejudice. In her own description, Sage was an \"apprentice misfit\". This sense of self fuelled her determination to make her own way on her own terms. </p> <p>In 1953, she moved across the border into England as a pupil at Whitchurch high school for girls. Here, she discovered a love of Latin to add to her love of reading. She learnt, too, the importance of being top of the class; intellectual success was a means of keeping moral disapproval at bay. Outside the proprieties of an English girls' grammar school, there were other fascinations: boys and the discovery of the power of her own beauty. Sage grew up with the sounds of rock 'n' roll and a sense that the old ways were no longer any good. </p> <p>At 15, she met Vic Sage, the man shortly to become her first husband. At 16, she was married and pregnant. At 17, she gave birth to her first and only child, Sharon. Undaunted, Sage continued to pursue her intellectual ambitions. She applied to Durham University to read English, and was awarded a scholarship. Her brilliance found a way through circumstances that might well have overwhelmed other women of her age and class. </p> <p>St Aidan's College altered its rules to allow access to women students who were also wives and mothers. Vic had also been awarded a place to read English at Durham. In 1961, a unique student family took up residence in a traditional English university. </p> <p>Even though their marriage was to end in divorce, the intellectual and emotional partnership Sage established with Vic was to last throughout her life. Their careers ran in parallel; both graduated with first-class degrees in 1964, both moved on to Birmingham University, where Sage studied at the Shakespeare Institute. In 1965, she became an assistant lecturer in English at the recently established University of East Anglia. In 1967, Vic took up a similar post at the same university. </p> <p>The institution that she joined was small, intense and experimental. Malcolm Bradbury and Angus Wilson were colleagues. The Shakespearian critic and scholar, Nicholas Brooke, who had taught Sage at Durham, was also there, as was the writer, Jonathan Raban. Both became close and lasting friends and discerning readers of her work. </p> <p>In the late 1960s, another significant friendship began with the historian and politician Patricia Hollis (now a government minister). Young women academics in a predominantly masculine environment, Sage and Hollis developed their friendship through their teaching. </p> <p>Well before the invention of \"new historicism\" they taught what was, at the time, a unique course on the urban landscapes of the 1830s and 40s. Questioning a simple-minded distinction between fact and fiction, they analysed the rhetoric of 19th-century fiction, philosophy and government reports, finding in the forms of language a guide to the mentality of a culture. </p> <p>This kind of teaching appealed to Sage, precisely because it made teaching a form of research. She believed university teaching should open up fields of inquiry rather than deliver settled doctrines. Her teaching grew out of the latest discoveries in her reading. Her seminars were intellectual events, where some new line of critical thought would unfold. </p> <p>If Sage was a charismatic teacher, through out the late 1960s and the 1970s she developed her identity as a critic. Early publications on Milton grew out of her work as a graduate student. These reflected her growing interest in neo-Platonism, an interest that was to take her to Italy and the archives and galleries of Florence. </p> <p>Neo-Platonism was a source of endless fascination. It played a crucial role in the English poetic tradition, something that could be traced in the work of Milton, Shelley and, in a transatlantic version, the poetry of Wallace Stevens. More than a set of philosophical doctrines, it offered a way of both imagining and managing the world; it was possible to be both this worldly and other worldly at the same time. </p> <p>Sage's major study of neo-Platonism and English poetry was uncompleted at the time of her death. Instead, there was an abundance of other published work. During the 1970s, she established her reputation as an authoritative reviewer of contemporary fiction. She worked with a number of distinguished literary editors, including Terence Kilmartin at the Observer, and Ian Hamilton at New Review. </p> <p>For Sage, reviewing was serious criticism. Her habit was to read all the available published work of any author she was reviewing. She was deeply engaged by the idea of writing about literature before it became canonical. Her reviewing was an opportunity to forge a style that could be both intelligent and accessible. </p> <p>Literary London became part of her actual and imaginative topography. It provided an alternative to academic life, but also a complement to it. Moving back and forth between what Sage described as \"Grub Street and academe\", she could combine the intellectual authority of the university with the stylistic energy of the great literary journalist. It also enabled her to satisfy that temperamental need to be inside and outside whatever world she was in. </p> <p>By the end of the 1970s, her first marriage had ended and her second marriage to Rupert Hodson had begun. This relationship was intimately connected to another doubling of her world; her research had taken her to Italy, where they met. She decided that she wanted to live in Italy and England, and developed a pattern of teaching at UEA during term time and writing in Italy during vacations. </p> <p>New and important friendships developed with Gore Vidal and Angela Carter. The friendship with Carter was deeply important to Sage, and coincided with another development in her work. From the late 1970s onwards, she published widely on women writers and woman's writing. In 1983, her study of Doris Lessing appeared. In 1991, she published Women In The House Of Fiction, a brilliant study of women's fiction in the 20th century. In 1994, a short book on Angela Carter came out, and in the same year she edited a collection of essays on Carter, The Flesh And The Mirror. </p> <p>But her concern was not simply to write about women, rather to make their work more widely and intelligently known. She wrote introductions to fiction by Katherine Mansfield, Christina Stead and Virginia Woolf. In 1994, she was appointed editor-in-chief of The Cambridge Guide To Women's Writing In English. </p> <p>As with so much of her work, Sage's engagement with women's writing combined passion with intelligence. She was attracted to women who wrote in order to survive and to overcome the cultural circumstances they had to endure. She was a feminist, but not one who wanted to live out her life as a public martyrdom. She was contemptuous of the way that men intrigued against women, but wanted to make her way in the world as she found it. She played a central role in the academic life of UEA. She was twice dean of the school of English and American studies and, in 1994, was appointed to a chair in English literature. </p> <p>The last five years of her life were increasingly dominated by the illness that eventually caused her death. Sage did not suffer fools gladly, and often the world seemed increasingly full of them. Although physically diminished by illness, she continued to write and teach with undiminished energy. Her Cambridge Guide was published in 1990, but what preoccupied her most was the completion of the memoir which provides such a compelling portrait of her as a young women. </p> <p>Life grew very hard for her. Her second marriage was under strain, but she was heroically supported by Sharon and a small circle of friends. At the time of her death, she had many projects in train and more to give to a literary culture she had done so much to shape. She is survived by Rupert Hodson, Vic Sage, Sharon and her granddaughter, Olivia. </p> <p>\u0095 Lorna Sage, journalist and critic, born January 13 1943; died January 11 2000 </p> <p>The first chapter of Lorna Sage's Bad Blood can be read at:<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters\" target=\"_NEW\">www.booksunlimited.co.uk</a></p>",

It's a fantastic monument to the fallibility of architects and the vanity of bishops, who wanted to build a gigantic cathedral in this small town but only achieved a third of it - a chancel broken off at the transept. The building soars over the town, a crown of stone supported by slim fingers which reach towards heaven, defying the laws of gravity. But gravity triumphed over the rest of the cathedral: a spire was built above the transept, taller by about 50ft than the spire of Salisbury cathedral and, too high and too wide, and it collapsed on Ascension Day 1573 just as the congregation emerged from the church. </p> <p>Beauvais cathedral might have ended up like other gross fantasies, as clumsy as Bokassa's half-completed cathedral in the Central African Republic or as ugly as Ceausescu's palace in Bucharest, but it has the splendour of a great (if unfinished) symphony: unresolved chords continue to resonate, a monument not to earthly ambition but to spiritual inspiration - what we would now call \"a work of art\". Edith Wharton described it, in a book about motoring through France that a friend sent me for Christmas, as the \"Kubla Khan\" of architecture. </p> <p>She drove - well, of course she didn't drive - her chauffeur drove her and her occasional travelling companion, Henry James, from fine restaurant to fine restaurant, from hotel to hotel (their luggage sent ahead), fastidiously weeding out the inferior ones: \"a brief peep into the hotel promptly quenched the impulse to spend a night there\". When they were travelling through the north of France it was unblemished by war: \"so green, so full and close in texture\". The same area was described by Scott Fitzgerald 16 years later in Tender Is the Night: \"Great funeral pyres of sorted duds, shells, bombs, grenades, and equipment, helmets, bayonets, gun stocks, and rotten leather... And suddenly round the bend the white caps of a great sea of graves.\" </p> <p><strong> December 31</strong> </p> <p>\"The motor-car has restored the romance of travel,\" said Wharton. Sitting in a traffic jam on the M25 I feel that something might have been lost in the near-century since her love affair with the car. </p> <p>Back in England, it's a relief to find that the media appears to have found nothing more to celebrate this New Year's Eve than Arthur C Clarke's novel and Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey. Last year the press, desperate as ever for topics to fill their glut of supplements, clutched at the celebration of the millennium like alkies topping up their Special Brew with a dose of meths. Articles spewed forth about the best person, politician, religious leader, building, book, film, play or song of the last 1,000 years. I remember only two statistics: the man of the millennium was Shakespeare, and the best song of the last 1,000 years was Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. As Max Miller would have said: \"Go on, lady, make something of that!\" </p> <p>The incessant invocation of the millennium's \"significance\" was like totalitarian propaganda, and as the clock moved towards midnight I felt like a dissident standing in Red Square while convoys of weapons and marching troops paraded to demonstrate the enduring glories of communism. The Dome was the Lenin's Tomb of millennium ideology. Now, only a year later, I wish that the politicians responsible for initiating and perpetuating it, as in the aftermath of the velvet revolution, showed some shame, but shame and politics are strangers to each other. At least it may have given some politicians pause before criticising managers of arts organisations for not knowing how to manage \"public attractions\". </p> <p><strong> January 1 2001</strong> </p> <p>New Year's Day. For me, making new year resolutions is like going to confession - a meaningless ritual intended to show piety and to assuage guilt at doing nothing positive to improve your life. This year I promise myself less drink and more exercise, both on St Augustine's terms - not yet. Yesterday's snow has disappeared and my wife and I walk in the footsteps of our local poet, the \"Super Tramp\" WH Davies, whose \"What is this life if, full of care,/We have no time to stand and stare?\" is currently featured in a TV commercial for Center Parcs leisure centres. </p> <p>I've spent much of the past year working as a writer, and for someone used to working with a group of people and, until three years ago, being responsible for a theatre the size of a small town, the solitude is hard to bear. \"A writer is a maker, not a man of action,\" said Auden, scorning biographies of writers as \"always superfluous and usually in bad taste\". These days, a truthful account of my life is as follows: \"Went to the country. Went for a walk. Saw a yellow wagtail. Wrote diary for the Guardian. Wrote rewrites for screenplay. Er, that's it.\" </p> <p><strong> January 2</strong> </p> <p>The screenplay I've been writing (with Charles Wood) is about love and old age. It's based on John Bayley's books about his life with his wife, Iris Murdoch, and her Alzheimer's disease. </p> <p>My mother got Alzheimer's in her 50s, so I have enough experience of observing it and warily examining my own memory from time to time. At a certain age, bits start to drop off and you begin to think: \"Have I got this or that?\" I once had a brain scan after a car accident; the good news was that I didn't have any sign of incipient Alzheimer's, but the bad was that I had a spot that might have been the beginnings of Parkinson's. </p> <p>\"The disease will probably start with a spasm in your arm which will become a tremor,\" said the doctor. So there's rarely a spasm in my arm that goes unaccompanied by a spasm of anxiety, and rarely a forgotten word or name that doesn't invoke a flicker of unease. </p> <p>I lean towards thinking of happiness as an absence of unhappiness, or agreeing with Tennessee Williams when asked for a definition of it: \"Er_ insensitivity, I guess.\" So I was chastened when I read a piece in the Observer by John Diamond, who has cancer and yet was celebrating his reasons to be cheerful. His ability to be thankful for what he regards as his good fortune is as admirable as his courage in dealing with his bad fortune. He makes me feel that not to try to be happy is an unforgivable self-indulgence. Now there's a new year resolution. </p> <p><strong> January 3</strong> </p> <p>I am giving up writing about myself: I'm giving up this diary, or it's giving me up, at least on a weekly basis. After 11 weeks of it I'm beginning to understand the weariness of the columnists who drop their opinions like cowpats week after week, those ones who live down to the German philosopher Karl Kraus's description of journalists: \"They write because they have nothing to say, and they have something to say because they write.\" At the same time my admiration has increased for those few regular columnists who manage to keep it up week after week: Miles Kington and Craig Brown, for instance. Perhaps they have a lively correspondence with their readers, who constantly suggest topics for them to write about. I've had two responses to my column. One letter demanded that I invite Jesus into my life before it was too late; the other referred to my \"special, beautiful soul\" and was keen to induct me into the Hindu faith.

They get around to making real money by starting up cheap(er) brasseries and bistros. It's been all the rage in Paris for some time. Over here, Marco Pierre White has done it. Raymond Blanc has done it. And Nico Ladenis, formerly of triple Michelin starred Chez Nico at 90, has done it twice. A few years back, he built up a mini-chain of Simply Nicos which he eventually sold on (and the standards promptly fell through the floor). Now he's at it again with Incognico, a medium-sized, rather manly establishment, which promises to be the first in a new series of eateries designed to bring decent grub to the New Labour working classes. </p> <p>The name, of course, is a joke. It's not simply a pun, but a pun which contains an interior fallacy. Nico has never been incog-anything. I suspect that personally he is a shy and retiring sort of chap, publicly he had a deft way with the headlines and the gossip columns, and while he may not be setting the tempo in the kitchen any more, there is a good deal about the food at Incognico that bears his unmistakable and magisterial imprint. </p> <p>This is not the c\u00e8pes risotto or boudin of foie gras of yesteryear, the Michelin marvels that many admired and few could afford, but altogether simpler and more accessible fare. The c\u00e8pes in the risotto have been replaced by ordinary mushrooms. There's the time-honoured combination of endive, Roquefort and pears; an equally traditional fillet steak au poivre vert; a dauntingly simple dish of grilled fillets of John Dory with thyme olive oil; veal kidneys with mustard sauce. Nothing particularly fancy about them, you may think, and nor is there, but there is a brilliant technical assurance which produces dazzling consistency. </p> <p>These days, this is really rather refreshing. It's not so much a matter of an old dog learning new tricks, but of an old dog paring his tricks down to the basic elements and polishing them to a lapidary gloss. So what if the menu is fabulously, unreconstructedly old-fashioned? But for the passing nod to contemporary fad (crispy salmon with ginger and plum sauce) it could have been lifted lock, stock and petits pois a la fran\u00e7aise from some L'Epicure or La Popote of yesteryear, even down to the cursory, if characteristically polished, gesture in the direction of Italy (a grand, semi- deliquescent osso bucco with Parmesan risotto). This is French food that made our parents, nay even our grandparents, misty-eyed with gastro-nostalgia. It is the food that made them fall in love with food in the first place. And, in truth, it does so all over again. </p> <p>I took Dorabella, as dedicated a vegetarian as I know, and the artichoke stuffed with a mushroom duxelle and enrobed (no other word will do) in a fulsome hollandaise caused her so much pleasure that nearby tables were under the impression that she was re-enacting the celebrated scene from the movie When Harry Met Sally. She was almost as deeply impressed by the open ravioli of goats' cheese with roast peppers, tomatoes and basil oil. Heaven knows, I have said my bit about this clich\u00e9d sop to vegetarian eating of the contemporary restaurant menu, but when the goats' cheese itself is a Class A item, as it was this time, and the bits and bobs making up the dish given due attention, why then goats' cheese dishes have their place. </p> <p>While Dorabella was waxing lyrical, I was getting quieter, if no less profound, satisfaction from the endive, Roquefort and pear salad, which was rather fancier in the presentation terms than I am used to, but which is a classic because, with ripe pears, ripe cheese and crunchy endive, it is very, very harmonious. The grilled John Dory fillets were even more splendid, fat fingers of taut fish, the just caramelised outside of which helped emphasise the shining freshness of the fish. </p> <p>As was always the way with French restaurants in the olden days, puddings get less significant treatment. On this occasion, the chocolate marquise bore scant resemblance to the definitive (and, it has to be said, system-crashingly rich) version of the recipe in Nico Ladenis's My Gastronomy, and the warm chocolate mousse, while suitably mousse-like, was rather too sugary for my liking. Still, considering what goes before, these are easy things to forgive. </p> <p>And considering you can eat a three-course lunch of this standard for \u00a312.50, why, you should come out smiling. We did, although the bill came to \u00a374.50 (food, \u00a354; drink, \u00a321.20); we had wandered far from the set-price menu, but that's my prerogative.</p>",

But for the passing nod to contemporary fad (crispy salmon with ginger and plum sauce) it could have been lifted lock, stock and petits pois a la fran\u00e7aise from some L'Epicure or La Popote of yesteryear, even down to the cursory, if characteristically polished, gesture in the direction of Italy (a grand, semi- deliquescent osso bucco with Parmesan risotto). This is French food that made our parents, nay even our grandparents, misty-eyed with gastro-nostalgia. It is the food that made them fall in love with food in the first place. And, in truth, it does so all over again. I took Dorabella, as dedicated a vegetarian as I know, and the artichoke stuffed with a mushroom duxelle and enrobed (no other word will do) in a fulsome hollandaise caused her so much pleasure that nearby tables were under the impression that she was re-enacting the celebrated scene from the movie When Harry Met Sally. She was almost as deeply impressed by the open ravioli of goats' cheese with roast peppers, tomatoes and basil oil. Heaven knows, I have said my bit about this clich\u00e9d sop to vegetarian eating of the contemporary restaurant menu, but when the goats' cheese itself is a Class A item, as it was this time, and the bits and bobs making up the dish given due attention, why then goats' cheese dishes have their place. While Dorabella was waxing lyrical, I was getting quieter, if no less profound, satisfaction from the endive, Roquefort and pear salad, which was rather fancier in the presentation terms than I am used to, but which is a classic because, with ripe pears, ripe cheese and crunchy endive, it is very, very harmonious. The grilled John Dory fillets were even more splendid, fat fingers of taut fish, the just caramelised outside of which helped emphasise the shining freshness of the fish. As was always the way with French restaurants in the olden days, puddings get less significant treatment. On this occasion, the chocolate marquise bore scant resemblance to the definitive (and, it has to be said, system-crashingly rich) version of the recipe in Nico Ladenis's My Gastronomy, and the warm chocolate mousse, while suitably mousse-like, was rather too sugary for my liking. Still, considering what goes before, these are easy things to forgive. And considering you can eat a three-course lunch of this standard for \u00a312.50, why, you should come out smiling. We did, although the bill came to \u00a374.50 (food, \u00a354; drink, \u00a321.20); we had wandered far from the set-price menu, but that's my prerogative.",

Even though they are fun and achieve a huge amount of growth in a short time, I steer clear of marrows, courgettes, squashes and pumpkins - whatever my friends may claim to the contrary, I find them watery and short on flavour. If you are supposed to eat them small and young, which is the case with courgettes, they need to be picked every day; otherwise they will quickly get ahead of you when your back is turned. </p> <p>But I do, on our compost heap, grow outdoor cucumbers, and found F1 Burpless Tasty Green prolific and prolonged-fruiting last year. Of moderate length, the fruits are thin-skinned, so I rarely peel them, and then only partially, when making soup, say. You do need to pick them regularly, however, so that the plants continue to make new cucumbers. Just twitch off the ready ones and lay them down where picked if you don't need any for cooking. There are only 10 seeds to a packet, but that is ample. We sow in pots under cold glass in early May, and cropping starts in late July. </p> <p>Last month, I was still enjoying a wonderful crop of Florence fennel, the bulbous-rooted kind, that we sowed in situ in mid-August. The seedlings were for a long time desperately slow, but the mild and wet autumn certainly suited them. They gave me really large bulbs, which I cut into four before boiling for 15 minutes. Then I drained and finished them off at a low heat in olive oil for five to 10 minutes. Lovely with fish, and so tender. </p> <p>It is important to space the fennel plants widely, so that they do not compete with one another and, in the cool weather, they hold for weeks without bolting. When frost has threatened, we throw over a length of hessian for the night. If need be, the uncooked bulbs keep well in a plastic bag in the fridge. </p> <p>I was very pleased with a dwarf French bean that we grew for the first time last year, called Masai. Its pods are small, slim and prolific, and they remain small for a long while. Naturally, they are stringless, which we have come to expect these days. On our cold clay soil, we seldom sow before mid-May. </p> <p>I don't grow a range of potatoes, as the ordinary kinds for baking or mashing are so easily bought, but waxy potatoes - especially useful in salads, but also for general purposes - are not so easily found in the shops. The old English variety, pink fir apple, is a must, for me, although its appearance is rather extraordinary - long, thin and often branching. I normally peel it after cooking, rather than before. Charlotte, which is a popular second early variety, is quite a large potato and keeps into the new year. Pink firs keep in a cold shed until April. We sprayed regularly against blight last summer, but there was no sign of any, right up to the end. </p> <p>Another spray that we had to repeat was on our broad beans, Express. That was against black aphids, which attack the young shoot tips in early summer and can make a complete mess of your plants if immediate action is not taken with a quick-acting chemical. Ladybirds and hoverfly larvae are too slow off the mark to do the job. </p> <p>Early purple-sprouting broccoli is just coming in now, and that is so welcome if the winter is mild enough to allow it to develop. A row of late purple will follow in April. I have been able to pick romanesco broccoli spasmodically ever since early autumn, but the strain needs re-selecting and gives very uneven results from plant to plant, but even so I am glad to have it. The flavour of cauliflower cannot touch that of the broccolis. </p> <p>On the whole, I am happy to forgo brassicas in summer, but make an exception of the Green Comet calabrese, which we bring on in pots (being an F1 hybrid, there's not a lot of seed) fairly early and which crops late June and July, if we get the timing right (and keep the pigeons at bay), before the green caterpillars get going in the heart of the curds. </p> <p>I see that Thompson &amp; Morgan is offering a Brussels sprout, F1 Trafalgar, of which it says that \"even children love them\". When I think of the way that greens were presented on the table when I was a child, it does not in the least surprise me that children should be put off, and Brussels are more often than not mishandled to this day. To keep their colour and flavour, all green brassicas should, in my experience, be boiled (not steamed) hard with the lid off the saucepan, for at least 10 minutes and served immediately. If not, they lose their colour and develop an objectionable tired flavour. Last-minute cooking can be a bore, I know, but in their case it really is important. If you are growing good vegetables, you might as well not spoil them when they reach the kitchen. </p> <p>That is why I always prefer to leave carrots in the ground through the winter, lifting them only when required. Their flavour, compared with what you can buy or store, is unrecognisably tasty. We are fencing them in (not covering them) with fleece these days, as it really does deter the carrot fly, which is not a high-flier and never reaches them.

Missed chances July 15 Anna is returned from Central Middlesex hospital to Kouao because the consultant paediatrician is persuaded that her injuries - cuts, bruises and red eyes - were self-inflicted as a result of scratching because of itchiness from scabies. August 6 After two weeks in North Middlesex hospital having allegedly poured boiling water over her head Anna is returned again. She had told social worker Lisa Arthurworrey and PC Karen Jones that she caused her own injuries. November 1 Anna makes an unfounded sexual allegation against Manning, withdrawn the next day. Arthurworrey believes Kouao put the child up to it in order to get housing. The social worker's police partner on the child protection team is assigned to find out why the false allegation was made. Her letter to Kouao is ignored. No further action is taken.",

      "body": "<p>Hypnotism has a terrible reputation. We think it's all about sinister men on stage making people hop like rabbits or do stripteases. But hypnotism has far wider and subtler applications, and you can even use it to improve your presentations at work. </p> <p>\"We teach people to communicate with their audience's unconscious minds,\" says David Shephard, chairman of The Performance Partnership, whose presenting course uses hypnotic techniques. </p> <p>\"We only use 5% of our brain power consciously, and the rest is unconscious. People respond, feel and make decisions with their unconscious mind, so any presentation will be much more effective if you communicate directly with that part of the brain,\" he explains. </p> <p>Alex McKie, a presenter who is studying hypnotherapy, adds: \"We get information at 2 million bits per second. The conscious mind can only remember about 32, whereas your unconscious takes in everything.\" </p> <p>Interestingly, the first step is to hypnotise yourself. Anyone who has ever given a presentation will be familiar with the racing heart, dry mouth and squeaky voice that nerves provoke. By hypnotising yourself into a light state of trance, you can overcome both physical and mental distractions. </p> <p>Practitioners insist self-hypnotism is perfectly safe and claim that many of us spend much of the time in a trance-like state anyway. As David Shephard says: \"Watching TV is hypnotic, and so is driving a car.\" </p> <p>The technique involves making yourself comfortable, slowing down your breathing, then staring at a spot on the wall, concentrating on feeling relaxed. Gradually, start noticing instead what is on the periphery of your vision. David Shephard explains: \"When you focus on one thing, the nervous system has a stress response, whereas peripheral vision makes you feel more relaxed.\" </p> <p>The technique has another benefit, too. If you use peripheral vision, you won't be distracted by the one person who is bored. Instead, you'll give attention to the whole audience and will be able to observe the overall response. </p> <p>In the presentation itself, the principal hypnotic techniques involve your tone of voice, appealing to people's unconscious questions and preferences, and using stories and anecdotes. </p> <p>\"About 38% of your communication comes from the pitch, pace and tone of your voice,\" says Alex McKie. \"So if you want to relax people, you drop your voice, talk much more slowly and leave lots of spaces.\" </p> <p>The next point is appealing to people's unconscious questions and preferences. \"People prefer to take in information in different ways,\" says David Shephard. \"Some like to have information visually, some prefer to hear it, some want to experience it kinesthetically through touch, and others want logic. In any audience, people will have a preference for one of those four types of information.\" </p> <p>The trick is to use all four channels. So as well as talking, show slides or pictures, have questions or voting for the hands-on approach, and use a logical flow of information. </p> <p>Unconsciously, different people in your audience will also be looking for answers to different questions. They are: </p> <p> Why is this information important? </p> <p>What are the facts? </p> <p>How does it work? </p> <p>What are the consequences? </p> <p>According to David Shephard, by answering people's instinctive questions, \"your presentation will always be perfectly structured\". </p> <p>Another powerful hypnotic technique is using stories and anecdotes. \"Storytelling is a fundamental way that we communicate,\" says Alex McKie. </p> <p>David Shephard adds: \"Metaphors, stories and anecdotes appeal to the unconscious mind and enable you to communicate a far deeper message.

      "bodyText": "Hypnotism has a terrible reputation. We think it's all about sinister men on stage making people hop like rabbits or do stripteases. But hypnotism has far wider and subtler applications, and you can even use it to improve your presentations at work. \"We teach people to communicate with their audience's unconscious minds,\" says David Shephard, chairman of The Performance Partnership, whose presenting course uses hypnotic techniques. \"We only use 5% of our brain power consciously, and the rest is unconscious. People respond, feel and make decisions with their unconscious mind, so any presentation will be much more effective if you communicate directly with that part of the brain,\" he explains. Alex McKie, a presenter who is studying hypnotherapy, adds: \"We get information at 2 million bits per second. The conscious mind can only remember about 32, whereas your unconscious takes in everything.\" Interestingly, the first step is to hypnotise yourself. Anyone who has ever given a presentation will be familiar with the racing heart, dry mouth and squeaky voice that nerves provoke. By hypnotising yourself into a light state of trance, you can overcome both physical and mental distractions. Practitioners insist self-hypnotism is perfectly safe and claim that many of us spend much of the time in a trance-like state anyway. As David Shephard says: \"Watching TV is hypnotic, and so is driving a car.\" The technique involves making yourself comfortable, slowing down your breathing, then staring at a spot on the wall, concentrating on feeling relaxed. Gradually, start noticing instead what is on the periphery of your vision. David Shephard explains: \"When you focus on one thing, the nervous system has a stress response, whereas peripheral vision makes you feel more relaxed.\" The technique has another benefit, too. If you use peripheral vision, you won't be distracted by the one person who is bored. Instead, you'll give attention to the whole audience and will be able to observe the overall response. In the presentation itself, the principal hypnotic techniques involve your tone of voice, appealing to people's unconscious questions and preferences, and using stories and anecdotes. \"About 38% of your communication comes from the pitch, pace and tone of your voice,\" says Alex McKie. \"So if you want to relax people, you drop your voice, talk much more slowly and leave lots of spaces.\" The next point is appealing to people's unconscious questions and preferences. \"People prefer to take in information in different ways,\" says David Shephard. \"Some like to have information visually, some prefer to hear it, some want to experience it kinesthetically through touch, and others want logic. In any audience, people will have a preference for one of those four types of information.\" The trick is to use all four channels. So as well as talking, show slides or pictures, have questions or voting for the hands-on approach, and use a logical flow of information. Unconsciously, different people in your audience will also be looking for answers to different questions. They are: Why is this information important? What are the facts? How does it work? What are the consequences? According to David Shephard, by answering people's instinctive questions, \"your presentation will always be perfectly structured\". Another powerful hypnotic technique is using stories and anecdotes. \"Storytelling is a fundamental way that we communicate,\" says Alex McKie. David Shephard adds: \"Metaphors, stories and anecdotes appeal to the unconscious mind and enable you to communicate a far deeper message. They make your presentation memorable and can have a huge impact on your audience. \"There's also the idea of 'nesting' stories, where you start a number of stories but don't finish them. This keeps the audience's attention because at an unconscious level they're waiting for the end of the stories. So you have their full attention and they're captivated.\" The usual approach is to 'nest' stories at the start of your presentation, giving the main content, then finishing the stories to signal you're coming to a close. Finally, you'll be reassured to know you can't get somebody to do something against their will using hypnosis. \"CIA research shows that hypnosis alone isn't enough to get people to do things against their wishes. It found it also required the use of psychoactive drugs, sleep deprivation or electric shock treatment,\" says David Shephard, \"none of which is provided in our training.\" If you don't remember anything else... Remember that the audience wants you to do well. Hypnotic techniques help you and the audience relax so you can communicate your message more effectively.",

North-east advertising agency AD78 has invited graduates to send in topless photos of themselves to see how far they would go to get a job as an account handler. The idea hasn't gone down well with the TUC, where a spokesman says: \"It isn't funny - and it is a potential breach of sexual discrimination law.\" Book of the week: Having sat on both sides of the interview table, outplacement specialist Alan Jones is well placed to bring us Winning at Interview , a guide to answering the toughest questions and landing the jobs you want. Published by Random House, the book can be ordered at the special price of \u00a34.99 plus p&amp;p from our Cultureshop on 0800 316 6102. On the up: The number of first degree graduates increased by 1%last year to 265,300, according to figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency. The numbers achieving a first remained steady, but the number gaining a 2.1 increased by 1% too. Opportunity knocked: Women are being denied access to bonuses and performance-related claims research for the Equal Opportunities Commission which says the near 20% gap between the earnings of men and women remains so high because employers are \"shockingly complacent\" about dealing with the issue of equal pay. Spell checker: Did you get stars for spelling at school? Sloppy spelling errors and commas in the wrong place can bring your climb up the career ladder to a full stop, warns a survey from temp agency Office Angels which claims one in three managers don't bother to read any further once they have spotted a couple of literacy errors in CVs, letter or reports. Job-hunter of the week: Don't give up hope, says Kevin Denton who has just found work after 17 years of searching. After five weeks of working in his new job as a clerk for an accounting firm in Bideford in Devon, Kevon says he has finally regained the confidence so badly dented by literally hundreds of rejection letters. Clock on: Are you envious of high-achievers at work? Do you wonder how they manage to coolly juggle so many balls? They have the same number of hours in their day - but something is different. They synchronise their work to their body clock, says career columnist Kathy Simmons: \"If you are mentally sharper in the early morning hours, don't do your filing and routine follow-up calls at this time. Use times of highest brain-power and energy level for demanding tasks. Reserve less challenging activities for afternoons. Schedule your work to match your natural body clock.\"",

      "byline": "Neil Schaeffer",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Marquis de Sade spent almost 30 years of his life in various prisons, and what got him there had almost nothing to do with his writing. His mother-in-law, Mme de Montreuil, having offered up her wealthy daughter to obtain De Sade's noble name, became outraged by his sexual scandals with prostitutes and with her other and most favoured daughter. Finally, Mme de Montreuil, \"the Hyena\", as De Sade called her, cut her losses and had him imprisoned under a lettre de cachet. - by which a prisoner's family paid his \"rent\" to keep him in prison. </p> <p>De Sade's vows of vengeance were stoked up during all those years locked up in Vincennes and the Bastille and when he was freed after the revolution, becoming an official of the radical Section des Picques in Paris, he had the opportunity to wreak that vengeance. The Montreuils fell under suspicion but this is how he described what he did: \"I caused the Montreuils to be moved on to a list of exculpated persons. If I had said a word, they would have been roughly handled. I held my tongue; there, you see how I avenge myself!\" </p> <p>De Sade is much more of a protean, amphibian creature, morphing from noble to revolutionary, and there is a great deal more to him, much of it decidedly more complex, interesting, and baffling, than the point that Quills, the film of his life, tirelessly belabours: that he is a martyr to the oppression and censorship of church and state. </p> <p>The movie opens with De Sade at an upper window watching the guillotine at work during the French revolution's bloodletting terror of September 1793-July 1794. Much later, we are told that this kind of activity explains the sanguinary streak in his writing. In fact, his bloodiest and best work, 120 Days of Sodom, was written in the Bastille - obviously before the revolution. This is an important book, and to suggest that it was written late in De Sade's life in the asylum at Charenton, where he spent the last 11 years of his life until his death in 1814, does the book and the viewer a disservice. </p> <p>De Sade was not at the height of his literary career nor of his literary powers at Charenton. Nor was he the imposing physical specimen implied by the tall, trim figure of the Australian actor Geoffrey Rush, who plays him in the film. At most, De Sade was of middling height. More to the point, his suffering and unhappiness had taken their toll. He had eaten himself into a considerable, even a grotesque, obesity. He was fortunate at Charenton to have come under the protection of the asylum's progressive and gentle director, the Abb\u00e9 de Coulmier, who encouraged De Sade to direct the other inmates and some professional actors in plays that soon attracted substantial and even fashionable audiences. This new therapy certainly had a beneficial effect on De Sade's spirit and energy. But the plays he put on were conventional warhorses of the Paris stage. There was no violent and sexual orgy scene as the movie depicts. </p> <p>Just as Rush in no way resembles De Sade, the handsome Joaquin Phoenix could never be mistaken for Coulmier, who, in fact, stood only four feet tall and was severely misshapen. This odd couple came to have a very good effect on each other. Coulmier was perhaps the first true male friend Sade made in his life, and this may indicate that some improvement had taken place in his mental health. </p> <p>The movie sacrifices the truth of this relationship and of Coulmier's own fate to a surreal and didactic conclusion that has no connection with the truth, and is probably overwrought even as a twist of a fictional plot. Indeed, De Sade's hideous death in the movie is nothing like the truth, for he died in his sleep, in his 74th year, as peacefully as any good Christian. The villain of the piece is made out to be Dr Royer-Collard. True, there was such a person, and he did disapprove of Coulmier's drama therapy as well as De Sade's presence in a hospital environment when he should have been in a prison. But De Sade had never been convicted of anything, including publishing pornography. When Royer-Collard was finally able to install his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as Coulmier's replacement, the drama therapy had long ago been suspended, and while De Sade did lose some of his privileges, he was already in the last year of his life. </p> <p>Of all the characters in the movie, Royer-Collard, played by Michael Caine, is the one that is the most inflated for melodramatic and didactic effect: he is given an underage orphan bride straight out of a nunnery; he is made into a sadistic husband and a fiendish tyrant in the asylum; and he is provided with the most implausible, seemingly ironic twist of fate to perform at the end. </p> <p>The single didactic message of the movie is that the seemingly good people are all bad underneath, are all hypocrites, while the seemingly bad person, De Sade, probably has some redeeming qualities: he tells it like it is, and apparently did not take sexual advantage of the young chambermaid (Madeleine LeClerc, played by Kate Winslet) with whom he was so friendly. However, De Sade's last journal makes it clear that he had been having a regular sexual liaison with the 18-year-old chambermaid from her early teens until the week before he died. </p> <p>In the film, the chambermaid /laundress smuggles De Sade's manuscripts out to his Paris publisher. In reality, this task was performed, quite unmelodramatically, by De Sade's companion of many years, Mme Quesnet, who was permitted to have a room at Charenton so she could be with him. </p> <p>The movie totally ignores this stable relationship and instead intrudes impossible and misleading scenes with De Sade's wife, who had formally separated from him after the revolution. </p> <p>Moreover the manuscripts Mme Quesnet smuggled out were not the dangerous novel Justine (whose much earlier publication had made his embarrassed family seek to hide him away in Charenton), but primarily a number of fairly conventional novels, as well as some stage plays he had written in his youth and which he hoped to have performed by the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise. He kept revising them in vain hopes of their acceptance. </p> <p>In the last year of his life, he received yet another publisher's rejection letter. This time, he could not misinterpret its brutal clarity: \"truly reprehensible... such a capital fault in a subject like this... inventions impossible not to find unfortunate... sheer 'melodrama'... written in verse that almost never rises to the level of good prose\". </p> <p>What is the harm in misrepresenting the true nature of De Sade's life and career? After all, some of the events in the movie did really happen to him at some time or other. Of course, playwrights and movie-makers are not under oath when they show us their work. And without condensation, there can be no art. The artist must make choices to put some things in and leave others out, a rule that applies to biographers as well.

      "bodyText": "The Marquis de Sade spent almost 30 years of his life in various prisons, and what got him there had almost nothing to do with his writing. His mother-in-law, Mme de Montreuil, having offered up her wealthy daughter to obtain De Sade's noble name, became outraged by his sexual scandals with prostitutes and with her other and most favoured daughter. Finally, Mme de Montreuil, \"the Hyena\", as De Sade called her, cut her losses and had him imprisoned under a lettre de cachet. - by which a prisoner's family paid his \"rent\" to keep him in prison. De Sade's vows of vengeance were stoked up during all those years locked up in Vincennes and the Bastille and when he was freed after the revolution, becoming an official of the radical Section des Picques in Paris, he had the opportunity to wreak that vengeance. The Montreuils fell under suspicion but this is how he described what he did: \"I caused the Montreuils to be moved on to a list of exculpated persons. If I had said a word, they would have been roughly handled. I held my tongue; there, you see how I avenge myself!\" De Sade is much more of a protean, amphibian creature, morphing from noble to revolutionary, and there is a great deal more to him, much of it decidedly more complex, interesting, and baffling, than the point that Quills, the film of his life, tirelessly belabours: that he is a martyr to the oppression and censorship of church and state. The movie opens with De Sade at an upper window watching the guillotine at work during the French revolution's bloodletting terror of September 1793-July 1794. Much later, we are told that this kind of activity explains the sanguinary streak in his writing. In fact, his bloodiest and best work, 120 Days of Sodom, was written in the Bastille - obviously before the revolution. This is an important book, and to suggest that it was written late in De Sade's life in the asylum at Charenton, where he spent the last 11 years of his life until his death in 1814, does the book and the viewer a disservice. De Sade was not at the height of his literary career nor of his literary powers at Charenton. Nor was he the imposing physical specimen implied by the tall, trim figure of the Australian actor Geoffrey Rush, who plays him in the film. At most, De Sade was of middling height. More to the point, his suffering and unhappiness had taken their toll. He had eaten himself into a considerable, even a grotesque, obesity. He was fortunate at Charenton to have come under the protection of the asylum's progressive and gentle director, the Abb\u00e9 de Coulmier, who encouraged De Sade to direct the other inmates and some professional actors in plays that soon attracted substantial and even fashionable audiences. This new therapy certainly had a beneficial effect on De Sade's spirit and energy. But the plays he put on were conventional warhorses of the Paris stage. There was no violent and sexual orgy scene as the movie depicts. Just as Rush in no way resembles De Sade, the handsome Joaquin Phoenix could never be mistaken for Coulmier, who, in fact, stood only four feet tall and was severely misshapen. This odd couple came to have a very good effect on each other. Coulmier was perhaps the first true male friend Sade made in his life, and this may indicate that some improvement had taken place in his mental health. The movie sacrifices the truth of this relationship and of Coulmier's own fate to a surreal and didactic conclusion that has no connection with the truth, and is probably overwrought even as a twist of a fictional plot. Indeed, De Sade's hideous death in the movie is nothing like the truth, for he died in his sleep, in his 74th year, as peacefully as any good Christian. The villain of the piece is made out to be Dr Royer-Collard. True, there was such a person, and he did disapprove of Coulmier's drama therapy as well as De Sade's presence in a hospital environment when he should have been in a prison. But De Sade had never been convicted of anything, including publishing pornography. When Royer-Collard was finally able to install his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as Coulmier's replacement, the drama therapy had long ago been suspended, and while De Sade did lose some of his privileges, he was already in the last year of his life. Of all the characters in the movie, Royer-Collard, played by Michael Caine, is the one that is the most inflated for melodramatic and didactic effect: he is given an underage orphan bride straight out of a nunnery; he is made into a sadistic husband and a fiendish tyrant in the asylum; and he is provided with the most implausible, seemingly ironic twist of fate to perform at the end. The single didactic message of the movie is that the seemingly good people are all bad underneath, are all hypocrites, while the seemingly bad person, De Sade, probably has some redeeming qualities: he tells it like it is, and apparently did not take sexual advantage of the young chambermaid (Madeleine LeClerc, played by Kate Winslet) with whom he was so friendly. However, De Sade's last journal makes it clear that he had been having a regular sexual liaison with the 18-year-old chambermaid from her early teens until the week before he died. In the film, the chambermaid /laundress smuggles De Sade's manuscripts out to his Paris publisher. In reality, this task was performed, quite unmelodramatically, by De Sade's companion of many years, Mme Quesnet, who was permitted to have a room at Charenton so she could be with him. The movie totally ignores this stable relationship and instead intrudes impossible and misleading scenes with De Sade's wife, who had formally separated from him after the revolution. Moreover the manuscripts Mme Quesnet smuggled out were not the dangerous novel Justine (whose much earlier publication had made his embarrassed family seek to hide him away in Charenton), but primarily a number of fairly conventional novels, as well as some stage plays he had written in his youth and which he hoped to have performed by the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise. He kept revising them in vain hopes of their acceptance. In the last year of his life, he received yet another publisher's rejection letter. This time, he could not misinterpret its brutal clarity: \"truly reprehensible... such a capital fault in a subject like this... inventions impossible not to find unfortunate... sheer 'melodrama'... written in verse that almost never rises to the level of good prose\". What is the harm in misrepresenting the true nature of De Sade's life and career? After all, some of the events in the movie did really happen to him at some time or other. Of course, playwrights and movie-makers are not under oath when they show us their work. And without condensation, there can be no art. The artist must make choices to put some things in and leave others out, a rule that applies to biographers as well. But if a biographer makes a mish-mash of his subject, there is hell to pay. If a movie does the same, there could be talk of Academy awards for all concerned, as there has been in this case. The viewer of Quills should be aware that what he is seeing is not De Sade. To see if Quills is valid in its own terms, let the viewer imagine it is about someone else, let us say the Marquis de Newcastle, and that the scene is Bedlam and then see if the movie makes any sense. The movie-makers and reviewers alike seem to think that the main point of De Sade's life and writing is to oppose censorship. In fact, his main obsession was to push the limits - sexual, spiritual, and political - as a means of feeling out the limits of his times and of his own mind. If there were no limits, there would be no meaning. When De Sade performed a sexual act with a prostitute and a communion wafer, he cried, \"If you are God, avenge yourself!\" The perversions were rhetorical acts at least as much as sexual ones. They were a way of opening a dialogue with the powers that be and with nature itself. In the same way, censorship was important to De Sade's way of thinking; he felt compelled to chal lenge it. Quills simplifies De Sade into a modern \"victim\" and over-emphasises his potential as a focus for liberal-political meanings when, in fact, his life and perhaps his literary intentions - if you think of him as a satirist - can be seen as an object lesson, warning against the excesses of cultural relativism and nihilism; a very modern lesson, it would seem. De Sade was an extremist on both sides. He plunged as deeply into the psyche as anyone had done before or since, yet he also sought some meaning, even if it were only punishment from above. \"If you are God, avenge yourself!\" God did not have to. The pity is that Quills did. \u0095 Neil Schaeffer's life of the Marquis de Sade will be published in paperback by Picador in March (\u00a38.99).",

Victoria Park - a fun day out for all the family. \u0095A handy betting tip. Next time Bradford are at home to Middlesbrough in the week of an eclipse, put your money on Boro to win 1-0. On Monday they repeated their feat of January 24 1925, when a solar eclipse threatened to disrupt the fixtures. \"Neither the FA nor the League have issued any instructions to clubs,\" Aston Villa's News &amp; Record complained at the time. \u0095The race is on in Oceania to grab the cash on offer at Fifa's World Club Championship, with regional powerhouses such as Foodtown Warriors (Fiji) battling it out in Papua New Guinea. The thought of playing Real Madrid proved too much for Lotoha'pai FC of Tonga, who went down to Australia's Wollongong Wolves in their first match, described in one report as \"a convincing 16-0 win\". What does an unconvincing 16-0 win look like? mike.ticher@theguardian.com",

Not even Dennis Wise, unless, of course, it was a paid-for interview with the newspaper to which his thoughts are contracted. </p> <p>Chelsea players are a sensitive lot, convinced they are the objects of hatred and envy to all outside Stamford Bridge. Yet many of their recent wounds have been self-inflicted, not least Wise's transfer demand, followed days later by a kiss-and-make-up with everyone from the tea ladies to, perish the thought, chairman Ken Bates. </p> <p>Wise omitted to mention his manager among those who persuaded him to stay. So Ranieri, though at the risk of gilding the lily, not only expressed his euphoria that Wise was staying but called upon him to help \"construct a new Chelsea\". </p> <p>Wise will speak only via his Boswell, though Dalla Bona, 19, was happy to discuss the changes since Ranieri replaced Gianluca Vialli a few games into the season. He says: \"We were all disappointed when Vialli went and it takes time to understand what a new manager wants. </p> <p>\"So in the beginning, we were a little confused and we were still adjusting to losing Vialli. But the mood is good now and every day we feel a little bit better. Naturally I am happy because I have become a regular first-team player and there is no problem communicating. I certainly do not have to interpret for the manager.\" </p> <p>When necessary that job goes to the Uruguayan Gustavo Poyet, though at half-time, when there is little time for translations, Ranieri uses flip charts with noughts and crosses and arrows to get his message across. Stuff that a genetically modified monkey could understand. </p> <p>The assistant manager Gwyn Williams says: \"There is no lack of communication and there never has been. Some of the training is conducted in English but if the manager is speaking to Gianfranco Zola, it makes sense to do so in Italian. There is also a difference between instructing and joking with the lads and talking into a TV camera, though I am confident he will conduct a press conference in English soon.\" </p> <p>Wise's sudden transfer demand was unsettling for the side. But it turned out to be a dissatisfied cri de coeur at being played out of position and left out altogether against Aston Villa on New Year's Day. </p> <p>The ploy worked; chairman Bates and the chief executive Colin Hutchinson rushed to dry his eyes and assured him that he would remain a pivotal figure at the club. Bates and Hutchinson have since disappeared on holiday, apparently not together, leaving Williams holding the cry baby. </p> <p>Williams says: \"I don't know quite what happened with Dennis. A situation evolved and has now been sorted and though he might have wobbled for a while, he is totally committed to the cause.\" </p> <p>Dalla Bona and his team-mates were also kept in the dark by Wise.\"He didn't say anything to us before or afterwards but we are all glad he is staying because he is a hero to everybody,\" he said. \"If you mention Chelsea in Italy, people will know Ranieri and they will also see a picture of Dennis, because he is the symbol of the club.\" </p> <p>Wise has always led by example on the pitch and though Ranieri seemed ready to push him towards the wings, both metaphorical and literal, he has brought in more young players in a hope of replicating that English bulldog spirit. </p> <p>Remarkably, though, Chelsea will again seek a first away win of the season at Highbury today, where they have an appalling record. Given the swaggering performances at home, their away form is baffling; it cannot just be the absence of the inspirational messages inside and outside the dressing room door at Stamford Bridge that read \"Strive To Win and Shun Defeat\" and \"Never Ever Give Up\", the sort of homilies you see framed behind the desk of US middle-management executives. </p> <p>Dalla Bona says: \"It has become a psychological problem for us. We have played well in many away games but when the other team score we seem to lose confidence. Maybe we need to play with more personality away from home.\" </p> <p>Williams is also at a loss to explain the side's failures away from the Bridge, though he offers an unusual solution. \"I remember Gordon Strachan at Coventry going 18 months without an away win and then he sacked the bus driver and they won three on the trot away.

      "body": "<p>John Bull turned up outside the Football Association's new headquarters in Soho Square yesterday to protest about the appointment of a foreigner as England coach. A pity Mr Bull could not hear the man out. He might have learned something. </p> <p>The niceties of national distinctions clearly do not mean much to Sven-Goran Eriksson, who today begins the task of taking England to the World Cup next year by watching West Ham United, the club which supplied the nucleus of the side that won the Jules Rimet trophy in 1966. </p> <p>\"Maybe today I feel more European than Swedish,\" said Eriksson when the xenophobes' point of view was put to him. \"After all I've been away from Sweden since 1982. In any case football is the same all over the world. If the results are bad it doesn't matter if you are English, Swedish or Chinese - you will always be criticised. But if England's results are good I don't think anyone will be worrying about nationalities.\" </p> <p>So confident is the Football Association that England have the right man to revive the national team that Eriksson is on a five-year contract worth \u00a33.5m per annum with a two-year option. As England have had four coaches - Graham Taylor, Terry Venables, Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan - since Bobby Robson's side reached the last four of the 1990 World Cup, the FA cannot afford to get it wrong now. </p> <p>Yesterday the 52-year-old Eriksson gave his first press conference as England coach six months earlier than planned. Lazio's poor results, which led to his resigning as the Rome club's coach on Monday, saw to that. </p> <p>A disarming personality, Eriksson is said to have few enemies in the game and after listening to him for the better part of an hour it is easy to see why. It is not that he avoids confrontation, he simply believes in preserving his energies for where they are most needed, and that is on the football field. \"I don't like polemic,\" he explained. \"If people make personal criticisms of me I try not to respond. I don't see any reason for it.\" </p> <p>When asked what he thought of anyone who considered England had appointed a losing coach, he proved equally passive. \"There is no use talking about what I have done or not done,\" he replied, \"because now it is all about what I do in the future.\" </p> <p>In terms of what he actually plans to do with the England squad Eriksson was less revealing. Which is hardly surprising since he has yet to watch English players live in any capacity other than an opposing coach or neutral observer. </p> <p>Nevertheless he was prepared to reel off a list of those he considered to have either world class or world-class potential: Steven Gerrard, Emile Heskey and Michael Owen of Liverpool, David Beckham and Paul Scholes of Manchester United, Rio Ferdinand and Paul Robinson of Leeds and West Ham's Joe Cole. </p> <p>Eriksson's requirements in an international footballer were equally unsurprising: \"He must have speed, strength, good technique, a good understanding of the play and good vision. Very few players in the world have all these qualities, and experience is important too.\" </p> <p>It seems safe to assume that Peter Taylor's caretaking decision to restrict his choice of team for the friendly in Italy to players of 30 or under will remain a one-off. \"You need a good mix of young players and those who are more experienced,\" Eriksson declared. \"So long as a player is good enough to play at the highest level then why not pick him? But experience is very important as well.\" </p> <p>Tactically Eriksson is reputed to prefer 4-4-2 formations but like any other coach he will see what talent is available to England before deciding how the team will play against Spain in next month's friendly at Villa Park. \"It is not true that I always play 4-4-2,\" he insisted. \"Last season, when Lazio won the Italian championship, we also played 4-3-3 or 4-5-1. Against France early this season England played 4-5-1 and it worked very well.\" </p> <p>Eriksson intends developing good relations with Sir Alex Ferguson and the other club managers who will regularly provide him with players. He also wants to have discussions with England's previous coaches on the job in hand. </p> <p>\"You have to be very open and if you can take ideas from someone then do so. You mustn't be too proud to ask questions and favours of other colleagues.\" </p> <p>Eriksson looked slightly perplexed when asked how he expected his England players to behave. Why, behaving like people representing their country: eating the right food, perhaps with a glass of wine, and playing cards but only for small amounts. \"If you play for big money it can become a problem.\" </p> <p>Eriksson himself comes over as the sort of person who would enjoy a friendly game of contract bridge.</p>",

Very few players in the world have all these qualities, and experience is important too.\" It seems safe to assume that Peter Taylor's caretaking decision to restrict his choice of team for the friendly in Italy to players of 30 or under will remain a one-off. \"You need a good mix of young players and those who are more experienced,\" Eriksson declared. \"So long as a player is good enough to play at the highest level then why not pick him? But experience is very important as well.\" Tactically Eriksson is reputed to prefer 4-4-2 formations but like any other coach he will see what talent is available to England before deciding how the team will play against Spain in next month's friendly at Villa Park. \"It is not true that I always play 4-4-2,\" he insisted. \"Last season, when Lazio won the Italian championship, we also played 4-3-3 or 4-5-1. Against France early this season England played 4-5-1 and it worked very well.\" Eriksson intends developing good relations with Sir Alex Ferguson and the other club managers who will regularly provide him with players. He also wants to have discussions with England's previous coaches on the job in hand. \"You have to be very open and if you can take ideas from someone then do so. You mustn't be too proud to ask questions and favours of other colleagues.\" Eriksson looked slightly perplexed when asked how he expected his England players to behave. Why, behaving like people representing their country: eating the right food, perhaps with a glass of wine, and playing cards but only for small amounts. \"If you play for big money it can become a problem.\" Eriksson himself comes over as the sort of person who would enjoy a friendly game of contract bridge.",

The tabloids may love to roast a failure, but even they would rather be celebrating success. Yet Eriksson is fully aware that, as he told a TV interviewer, with his first defeat he will be \"hung\". Football, he added, is like that over the world. </p> <p>\"I have read the discussions,\" he said, \"and I know some people are against me and others are for me. Everyone is free to have an opinion. I'm sorry about the situation. Of course I'm happier when people are for me. But I think I have to defend myself in the future by playing good football with the team and by getting good results. That's the only way you can defend yourself as a manager.\" </p> <p>Yesterday he told us a little more about himself. He will live in or near London, although he is unlikely to find quite as attractive a central location as the Piazza di Popolo, where he had his base in Rome. He likes to play tennis, which will no doubt lead to a new rash of \"Anyone for Svennis?\" headlines. A recent photograph of Eriksson astride a Harley-Davidson motorcycle turned out to have been a stunt on behalf of a charity appeal. \"I have never been one metre on a Harley-Davidson,\" he said, \"and I never will.\" </p> <p>We have yet to see whether a reluctance to take risks on the road is reflected in his attitude to selecting an international football team. \"I don't want to talk about individuals,\" he said yesterday, and naturally he was giving little away about the composition of his first squad. But he did say, when invited to send a message to the younger generation of English footballers, that \"when I pick the first 22, it will not be that 22 for ever\". </p> <p>He was understandably equivocal about the balance between youth and experience in an international squad. \"I think the future is for young players,\" he declared, \"but when you come to pick a team you can't only choose young players. You must have players with a lot of experience also. You can't go and beat Germany away with no experience. That's impossible.\" </p> <p>What would he do, he was asked, that would be different from, and better than, the work of his predecessors? \"I don't know exactly how the preparation worked before me,\" he replied, \"and I don't think I'm going to find out, either. It's history, and nothing to do with the future.\" </p> <p>It was an advantage, he thought, that he was coming in from the outside, without allegiances or favourites among players and clubs. \"But it's a big disadvantage that I've been seeing too little of English football lately.\" When pressed, he agreed that he would be talking to those of his predecessors still active with English clubs - Bobby Robson, Graham Taylor, Terry Venables, Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan - although there was no suggestion that he would be looking for guidance. </p> <p>The length of his contract, he agreed, was in itself a confirmation that the FA are thinking of the long term. \"For a manager, that's perfect. It gives me tranquillit\u00e0 .\" </p> <p>His long stay in Italy came to a messy conclusion earlier this week, although Lazio's management and public gave him a warm send-off and on Thursday one of his former players, the Argentina midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron, absolved him of all blame on behalf of the squad. \"I'm not happy with how it ended up at Lazio, that's for sure,\" Eriksson said yesterday. \"But I'm happy to be here today. Every time we lost, the England story came up as one of the reasons. I never thought that because I believe footballers are more professional than that. It didn't help, maybe. But it's no use that I talk about what I've done or not done. What I've done doesn't matter. What matters is I must do for the future to show that England can have a good team.\" </p> <p>Last week, France Football magazine produced a chart of European countries, based on international performances throughout the year 2000, which showed England in 20th place. \"To me,\" Eriksson said when questioned about England's current lowly status, \"the big European football countries are Spain, Germany, Italy, France - and England, for sure. Those are the countries with 50 or 60m people. England should be one of them. We hope to improve.\" </p> <p>But does England possess players of the quality needed to lift them back into the elite? Have they, for instance, got the sort of full-backs needed to play with a flat back four? \"I don't know. Give me that question again in one month and I will tell you. But I think you can find good players in every position in a big football country like England.\" This time, no one asked him if he knew the name of Sunderland's left-back. If he doesn't know now, then by Sunday night, after watching Sunderland's match at Portman Road, he certainly will. </p> <p>And the chap on the pavement might like to know that Eriksson intends to sing the English national anthem before the matches. \"I'll have to learn the words,\" he said. \"I have no problem with that. I'm not a very good singer. That's the problem.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>ITV has captured the BBC commentator Jon Champion to join Clive Tyldesley, Peter Drury, Guy Mowbray and Peter Brackley to complete the commentary team covering the Premiership and the Champions League for the commercial network next season. There are no plans for more commentators to be signed. </p> <p>It is understood that ITV considered luring John Motson or Barry Davies from the other side but decided they might be \"past the winning post\" and also rejected big-money moves for Sky's Martin Tyler and Alan Parry. Champion is considered to be as sharp as they come as a commentator - quick with player identification and alive to the flow of the game - and also not lacking in journalistic skills, spotting a developing story at an early stage. He can tend to be a little Motsonian at times but the more edgy commercial atmosphere over at ITV may help his commentaries lose their occasional ponderousness.</p> <p>Champion was keen to stress that the ITV head of sport Brian Barwick had bought him for what he is rather than what he can turn him into. Champion said: \"Some might say I am a bit too much of a BBC man but who is more BBC than Des Lynam?

      "bodyText": "ITV has captured the BBC commentator Jon Champion to join Clive Tyldesley, Peter Drury, Guy Mowbray and Peter Brackley to complete the commentary team covering the Premiership and the Champions League for the commercial network next season. There are no plans for more commentators to be signed. It is understood that ITV considered luring John Motson or Barry Davies from the other side but decided they might be \"past the winning post\" and also rejected big-money moves for Sky's Martin Tyler and Alan Parry. Champion is considered to be as sharp as they come as a commentator - quick with player identification and alive to the flow of the game - and also not lacking in journalistic skills, spotting a developing story at an early stage. He can tend to be a little Motsonian at times but the more edgy commercial atmosphere over at ITV may help his commentaries lose their occasional ponderousness. Champion was keen to stress that the ITV head of sport Brian Barwick had bought him for what he is rather than what he can turn him into. Champion said: \"Some might say I am a bit too much of a BBC man but who is more BBC than Des Lynam? Brian Barwick is a former BBC man himself and I think his plan is to take the best elements of their soccer coverage and combine it with ITV's virtues, as well as some of the values of Sky, whose football programmes are also much admired.\" Clearly a key factor in Barwick's plan to imbue ITV's new highlights programme with some of the more successful elements of Match of the Day is his continuing raid on BBC Sport's backroom staff. Tony Pastor, who at 30 is considered to be among the brightest young production talent at the BBC, is leaving his job as producer at MOTD for a similar role on ITV's new highlights programmes, while Paul McNamara, a Match of the Day executive who won a Bafta award for his redesign of the BBC's football show, will be working on the look of ITV's new highlights programmes. As well as the new Saturday teatime show - 6pm is likely to be the only logical time for it, given the apparent immovability of the ratings winner Blind Date - there will be a Sunday or Monday highlights programme each week, including a round-up of all the weekend's Premiership action. Additionally, towards the beginning and end of the season, there is likely to be a Wednesday night highlights show as well.

The hard man of punditry may feel himself under-employed next season when the BBC is restricted to the FA Cup and England internationals, with the possibility of buying some Uefa Cup action directly from British qualifiers.

And it's possibly overrated because it trips itself up in the final stretch, so frustratingly that you almost want to wash your hands of it. It makes instructive viewing alongside Unbreakable. </p> <p>Shyamalan's film is about a man who is the sole survivor of a train crash, and discovers that he has powers that distinguish him from the rest of humanity. In Weir's film, Max Klein (Jeff Bridges) is one of several survivors of a plane crash. He too comes to believe there is something special about him - that he has not only escaped death but transcended it. </p> <p>Early in the film, we get the strangest, subtlest inkling of what's happening to Max. Visiting an ex-girlfriend, he treats the two of them to a plate of strawberries - ripe and red, shot in succulent close-up. He pops one into his mouth and beams with the joy of life. Then his ex reminds him that he used to be allergic to strawberries - that one nearly killed him. </p> <p>It's not just fruit he no longer fears. He casually walks across a busy freeway, then dances on the edge of a rooftop. He has witnessed the moment of his own death, and passed through it. He's unbreakable - or perhaps just in an extreme state of denial. </p> <p>Weir's film - adapted by Rafael Yglesias from his own novel - plays with rather higher stakes than Shyamalan's avowedly comic-strip story. Fearless wants to go the whole philosophical and psychological nine yards, which makes it much less clear-cut than the average Hollywood essay in deep feeling. Max has become either an angel or a monster, either painfully honest or boorishly tactless. He turns his back on terra firma - on his kids and his wife, played with nervous intensity by Isabella Rossellini - and forms a bond with a young woman (a vividly pained Rosie Perez), who has lost her child on the flight. He both befriends her and takes drastic steps to cure her of her Catholic guilt. </p> <p>Fearless dazzles you with the intensity of its images, shot with unnerving cleanness by Allen Daviau - notably the scene in which Bridges walks down a deserted flyover and through what appears to be a deserted city, as well as the opening slow-motion drift through a cornfield and Bridges impassively wandering through the carnage from the plane crash. Bridges is at his complex best, too - does any other Hollywood actor have the same knack of appearing at once a warm, vulnerable human being, yet also an abject, strutting creep? The film's boldness in overtly tackling big themes (guilt, mortality, theology) explains why it was a box-office dud. Fearless is a dazzling anomaly - the closest Hollywood has come to producing a Krzysztof Kieslowski film. Compare Kieslowski's Three Colours: Blue, in which Juliette Binoche survives the death of her family in a road accident. </p> <p>Arguably, Fearless takes on too much, and there comes a point when all the talk gets a little leaden and theatrical. But the big flaw is at the end, when Weir feels obliged to lay on a major climax, in the form of an apocalyptic and extremely detailed flashback to the plane crash itself. And at the very last second, the film loses its nerve totally, and pulls back from the tragic abyss it's poised to leap into. Without revealing too much, it involves another strawberry, and what could have been devastating becomes one of Hollywood's ready-made redemptions. </p> <p>Shyamalan, however, making a film that is supposedly pure entertainment, signally resists such compromises. Not only is Unbreakable's ending more than a little disturbing, but the film thrives on understatement, refusing, for example, to show the train crash that changes his hero's life. </p> <p>I'd like to think that Unbreakable, like Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense and Christopher Nolan's rigorously mathematical Memento, shows signs of a new no-frills approach to storytelling in American cinema. Shyamalan is committed to telling a story and nothing in the film is superfluous to that. Fearless's last-minute failure of nerve is that it wants to send us out of the cinema feeling good, or at least relieved. Unbreakable doesn't - and perhaps its success will help other Hollywood films to resist pulling back at the brink. But what a brink - a centimetre more, and Fearless would have been pure west coast Kieslowski. In a parallel universe, I like to imagine it being the first part of a Peter Weir philosophical trilogy - Three Flavours: Strawberry. </p> <p>\u0095 Fearless is available on video from Warner Bros.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When Anna Climbie left the crumbling shacks of the sprawling shanty suburb of Abobo, Ivory Coast, in November 1997 she was \"happy and excited\".<br><br> The child was leaving the muddy streets and crammed housing of the west African country and going to a new life with her aunt.<br><br>The seven-year-old was being taken first to France and then to Britain for a better education and standard of living.<br><br> She was saying goodbye to a country where the average life expectancy is around 45, where each family has six children and where only 40% of women over 15 are literate.<br><br>To her mother and father, the move would bring a great honour on the family and eventually Anna might earn money and send some back to them. The Climbies had fallen on hard times and all nine of them had had to move in with a relative.<br><br>But instead of honour the family found only grief. Anna did not even get to go to school. Just over a year after leaving Ivory Coast, Anna Climbie was dead at the age of eight.<br><br>The victim of horrendous physical and emotional abuse, she was failed by all those who were bound up in her care.<br><br> Her death, in February last year, was the worst case of child abuse the Home Office pathologist who examined her battered body had ever seen.<br><br>Anna's last months were a savage existence. Instead of being at school and playing with other children she was bound hand and foot, naked, in a bathtub in a tiny flat in Tottenham in the middle of winter.<br><br> Instead of being fed she was starved: what little food she was given were scraps, fed to her in the bath on a piece of plastic bag.<br><br> Instead of being clothed, she was stuck in a black binbag which caught her excrement and trapped acids that burned her body.<br><br> Instead of praise, Anna was told she was possessed by the devil.<br><br> While her torturers were in the other room, Anna was left alone in the cold and dark in the unheated bathroom. They shut the door on her.<br><br> Anna simply got in the way of her demented aunt, Marie Therese Kouao, 44 - a woman the Old Bailey was told was \"evil\" - and her busdriver boyfriend, Carl Manning, 28, whom she picked up on a number 18 bus in Wembley.<br><br> Anna was not the meal ticket to social security benefits her aunt had first thought. She was just an inconvenience.<br><br> Over the months Anna was beaten with a variety of weapons including belt buckles, bicycle chains, coat hangers and shoes; razor blades were taken to her fingers and a hammer to her toes.<br><br> The child was burned with cigarettes and had boiling water poured over her head.<br><br> She \"stooped like an old woman\" after being confined to the bath.<br><br> After all this, she was dragged to a church to be exorcised because her aunt said she had evil spirits in her.<br><br> And all the while those who should have been concerned with her welfare - doctors, police and social services - let Anna down.<br><br> In spite of her being referred to social services on a number of occasions, no one ever checked on her properly.<br><br> In spite of the marks on her body, the child was returned to Kouao because a doctor believed her story that Anna had scabies.<br><br> And in spite of a senior doctor saying it was a case of child abuse, Anna went back to the Tottenham flat to become, as the same doctor said, \"lost somewhere in Haringey\". No one bothered to check.<br><br> Two police protection orders were taken out on the girl in July 1999, but nothing was done. A social services strategy meeting decided a home visit should be conducted but it never took place. The social worker and police officer were too scared of catching scabies.<br><br> Eventually, this small child - people remarked that she was half the size she should have been for her age - died from hypothermia due to exposure to cold and wet conditions.<br><br> The underlying cause was severe neglect and malnutrition.<br><br> The pathologist, Nathaniel Carey, found 128 marks on her body.<br><br> He said: \"This little girl was covered in scars, she had been bound, she was underweight and she had been maltreated in terms of personal hygiene.<br><br> All cases of child abuse leading to death are pretty horrific but this one, in nature and extent of injury, is quite exceptional.<br><br>\" When Marie Therese Kouao came to Abobo to take Anna away from her brothers and sisters, everything looked grand.<br><br> This woman - whom the family had only met on two previous occasions at funerals - seemed reasonably wealthy and said she had a good job in the aviation industry in Paris.<br><br> She had just been promoted, she said, and would soon be moving to London.<br><br> The widowed Kouao had three grown-up boys of her own and an adopted daughter.<br><br> She would treat Anna like a daughter, ensuring her education.<br><br> But the child, who was called Adjo Victoria in Ivory Coast, would have to change her name to Anna so she could carry the forged passport that had been made in the name of Anna Kouao.<br><br> (The real Anna Kouao was supposed to come to the UK but her parents changed their minds and refused to let Kouao take the child from Ivory Coast.

      "bodyText": "When Anna Climbie left the crumbling shacks of the sprawling shanty suburb of Abobo, Ivory Coast, in November 1997 she was \"happy and excited\". The child was leaving the muddy streets and crammed housing of the west African country and going to a new life with her aunt. The seven-year-old was being taken first to France and then to Britain for a better education and standard of living. She was saying goodbye to a country where the average life expectancy is around 45, where each family has six children and where only 40% of women over 15 are literate. To her mother and father, the move would bring a great honour on the family and eventually Anna might earn money and send some back to them. The Climbies had fallen on hard times and all nine of them had had to move in with a relative. But instead of honour the family found only grief. Anna did not even get to go to school. Just over a year after leaving Ivory Coast, Anna Climbie was dead at the age of eight. The victim of horrendous physical and emotional abuse, she was failed by all those who were bound up in her care. Her death, in February last year, was the worst case of child abuse the Home Office pathologist who examined her battered body had ever seen. Anna's last months were a savage existence. Instead of being at school and playing with other children she was bound hand and foot, naked, in a bathtub in a tiny flat in Tottenham in the middle of winter. Instead of being fed she was starved: what little food she was given were scraps, fed to her in the bath on a piece of plastic bag. Instead of being clothed, she was stuck in a black binbag which caught her excrement and trapped acids that burned her body. Instead of praise, Anna was told she was possessed by the devil. While her torturers were in the other room, Anna was left alone in the cold and dark in the unheated bathroom. They shut the door on her. Anna simply got in the way of her demented aunt, Marie Therese Kouao, 44 - a woman the Old Bailey was told was \"evil\" - and her busdriver boyfriend, Carl Manning, 28, whom she picked up on a number 18 bus in Wembley. Anna was not the meal ticket to social security benefits her aunt had first thought. She was just an inconvenience. Over the months Anna was beaten with a variety of weapons including belt buckles, bicycle chains, coat hangers and shoes; razor blades were taken to her fingers and a hammer to her toes. The child was burned with cigarettes and had boiling water poured over her head. She \"stooped like an old woman\" after being confined to the bath. After all this, she was dragged to a church to be exorcised because her aunt said she had evil spirits in her. And all the while those who should have been concerned with her welfare - doctors, police and social services - let Anna down. In spite of her being referred to social services on a number of occasions, no one ever checked on her properly. In spite of the marks on her body, the child was returned to Kouao because a doctor believed her story that Anna had scabies. And in spite of a senior doctor saying it was a case of child abuse, Anna went back to the Tottenham flat to become, as the same doctor said, \"lost somewhere in Haringey\". No one bothered to check. Two police protection orders were taken out on the girl in July 1999, but nothing was done. A social services strategy meeting decided a home visit should be conducted but it never took place. The social worker and police officer were too scared of catching scabies. Eventually, this small child - people remarked that she was half the size she should have been for her age - died from hypothermia due to exposure to cold and wet conditions. The underlying cause was severe neglect and malnutrition. The pathologist, Nathaniel Carey, found 128 marks on her body. He said: \"This little girl was covered in scars, she had been bound, she was underweight and she had been maltreated in terms of personal hygiene. All cases of child abuse leading to death are pretty horrific but this one, in nature and extent of injury, is quite exceptional. \" When Marie Therese Kouao came to Abobo to take Anna away from her brothers and sisters, everything looked grand. This woman - whom the family had only met on two previous occasions at funerals - seemed reasonably wealthy and said she had a good job in the aviation industry in Paris. She had just been promoted, she said, and would soon be moving to London. The widowed Kouao had three grown-up boys of her own and an adopted daughter. She would treat Anna like a daughter, ensuring her education. But the child, who was called Adjo Victoria in Ivory Coast, would have to change her name to Anna so she could carry the forged passport that had been made in the name of Anna Kouao. (The real Anna Kouao was supposed to come to the UK but her parents changed their minds and refused to let Kouao take the child from Ivory Coast. Police say she is lucky to be alive.) Anna was a bright girl who had been to kindergarten and had just started school where she was making good progress. In the witness box of the Old Bailey, Anna's mother, Berthe Amoissi Ehoura, stood composed, a handsome, dignified woman determined to bear testament to the memory of her child. She said of her daughter, the third youngest of seven: \"She was very good with me and very easy with me. She had no illness as a child.\" Soon after arriving in France Kouao decided to move to London. She was being pursued over \u00a32,000 in a suspected social security fraud. She told people she wanted to learn English. It was easy to get Anna, who Kouao said was her daughter, past British immigration authorities: Kouao was a French citizen and often children do not resemble passport photographs taken years or months before. After a short time staying with a relative, Kouao asked Ealing council to accommodate her in April 1998. The council told the woman and child that they should go back to her four-bedroomed house in France because they were intentionally homeless. Eventually she was found a room in a hostel in Harlesden. In May a social worker remarked that the child was poorly dressed in relation to her aunt. One family member was shocked to see the little girl wearing a ridiculous wig. On June 10, Kouao met Manning while he was driving his bus. The man described by his own QC as \"a bit of a nerd\" who lived with his mother and led \"a lonely, boring life\", and who had never had a girlfriend, gave the older woman his telephone number and she called the next day. He was impressed by this worldly woman who had boasted of being an air accident investigator and claimed to have studied at the \"university of Oxford Street\". Ten days later the pair slept together. Not long after, Esther Ackah, a distant relative of Kouao's, met Kouao, Manning and Anna in the street. Afterwards Mrs Ackah, a nurse, twice phoned Ealing social services to raise concerns about Anna's living conditions and her deteriorating health. She said she feared for the little girl's life. But still nothing was done. On July 6, Kouao and Anna moved into Manning's tiny flat in Tottenham. Things did not go smoothly and Manning became angry when Anna urinated and defecated around the flat. Panicking at the prospect of losing this new man or maybe his flat, Kouao tried to offload Anna on to a family who had done childminding for her in the past. The Camerons took Anna for the night and put her straight to bed. They were horrified the following morning when they saw that the child was covered in terrible injuries. Anna had cuts on her fingers, across her cheek and eyelid and unusual marks on her body which Avril Cameron suspected were cigarette burns. She took her to Central Middlesex hospital and was told Anna would only be released into safe hands. But in spite of all the marks on her body, Anna was discharged after an overnight stay because the child protection doctor, Ruby Schwartz, said she was satisfied that she was suffering from scabies. Dr Schwartz referred the case to social services because of concerns that the family appeared to be homeless and that Anna was not at school. Social workers called a strategy meeting but failed to do anything because Kouao and Anna had moved out of the area. Two weeks later Anna was in hospital again, this time with scalding to her head. Her aunt said the child had poured hot water over herself to relieve terrible itching caused by scabies. Instead of taking Anna to the health centre next to Manning's flat she walked the child 20 minutes to hospital, taking her there hours after the accident. Staff on Rainbow ward noticed that Anna's clothes were dirty and that she was wearing no underwear. One nurse remarked that she could not find a place on Anna's body that was not sore when she tried to lift her into a bath. In the two weeks she was there nurses noted that there was a \"master and servant\" relationship between Kouao and Anna. The child had shown signs of emotional abuse and anxious attachments and had poured a bottle of Hibiscrub over her head to ease her pain. One morning she ate five bowls of cereal \"like a child who does not know where her next meal is coming from\". But not once did she mention any abuse, leading staff to believe that this odd little girl had been coached not to say too much. She would jump out of bed and stand to attention when Kouao - whom she called mother - came into the hospital ward, saying things like \"my mummy's a good mummy\". Mary Anne Rossiter, a doctor who told the court that she had put in writing that she had no doubts this was child abuse, said: \"I was aware that she came in an underclothed, dirty state in contrast to her very soignee, well-dressed mother.\" She said the marks on Anna looked likely to have been inflicted with deliberate force, including the imprint of a belt buckle. In spite of this, Anna was discharged on the authority of social services on August 6 while Dr Rossiter was on leave. She said: \"We asked after her and were horrified to learn that she had in fact been discharged.\" In her letter to a social worker, Lisa Arthurworrey, she said: \"I have enormous concerns about this child. I think this child may have been abused.\" Ms Arthurworrey was a member of Haringey's child protection team and, along with PC Karen Jones, saw Anna and believed Kouao when she repeated the scabies story, telling them that was what the other hospital had also said. Without speaking to doctors or examining Anna without clothes, they let her go - back to what would become ever intensifying torture. They did not visit the flat, fearing they might catch scabies. They were happy enough, however, to let the little girl go back to what they believed was an infested place. In court, these child protectors were criticised for their \"blinding incompetence\". For Anna, things were to get worse. By the end of October her tormentors began tying her up and throwing her in the bath. In his diary, Manning begins to refer to Anna as \"satan\". In one account, when he describes how after a row at New Year Kouao had run naked in the street after an argument, he wrote: \"After a minute or so, she walked back to the flat in bare feet to release satan Anna from her rubbish bag.\" The child was dragged around to various churches in London which reinforced the belief that evil spirits were within her. Less than a week before her death, Anna was taken to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, stood in the middle of the congregation and shouted that prayers did not work for her and that she would eat everyone alive. Earlier, she had asked a voluntary worker at the church whether she had any food. Audrey Hartley-Martin gave Anna some biscuits which she repaid with a smile. She added: \"When mum came, the child put the biscuits in her pocket and jumped off my lap.\" The following day Anna told the assistant pastor, Alvero Lima, that she used to have dreams where a vision of a snake would appear in front of her and tell her to do such things. \"She said it was satan,\" he said, adding: \"Yes, I thought the child was possessed. She said she liked doing evil, she liked doing it.\" The pastor told Kouao that he would pray and fast for the child who should be brought back the following Friday, February 25, to release the evil spirit. But the day before the exorcism, Kouao phoned the church saying that Anna felt like a block of ice. When the child was brought to the church, the pastor found that she was cold and wet and not speaking and he could not find a pulse. He told Kouao and Manning that they must take Anna to hospital. A taxi was called and told to take the family to Tottenham, but, seeing that the child was so ill, Kouao asked where the nearest hospital was and the driver dropped them off at a nearby ambulance station. Anna was taken to North Middlesex hospital where her serious injuries and evidence of malnutrition were found. Nurse Lesley Nelson, part of a three-person retrieval team which picked up Anna from North Middlesex hospital and took her to St Mary's in Paddington, said the condition of the child was \"quite horrendous\". Her temperature was 27C, nine degrees below normal. Despite extensive efforts by staff, Anna died early in the morning on February 25. At last seeing clear evidence of abuse, police arrested Kouao at the hospital. Manning was taken from the Tottenham flat where he immediately began confessing his role in the torture and eventual death of the child. He admitted manslaughter and cruelty to a child - although he claimed he was responsible for just one third of her injuries - but his girlfriend defiantly denied any knowledge of how Anna came to be in her dreadful condition. While in prison, the unremorseful Kouao told a pastor: \"Anna caused trouble for me when she was alive, and now she is dead she is still causing trouble for me.\" She also said: \"Look what Anna has done to me. After making me suffer, she has just died and I have suffered for nothing.\" Stubborn to the end, Kouao did not tell police that Anna was not her daughter until confronted with DNA test results, and refused to give them details of her real identity. Eventually officers traced Anna's family, who knew nothing of the trauma their little girl had had to live through. They were told that a child was dead and that police were not sure if it was their daughter. A family liaison officer who broke the news to the family and brought them to Britain said: \"They were absolutely devastated but they wanted to do the identification. They wanted to be able to have knowledge of the injuries. They were shown post- mortem photographs of her injuries. This was a very difficult time for them. This was the first time they had been on an aeroplane or an escalator. They had no concept of the dangers of traffic.\" But the horror was not at an end. After they made a positive identification, the family could not take Anna's body home with them - Kouao refused to let them, saying she wanted to bury her herself. It will be some time before Anna's body will be allowed to return home. A coup in Ivory Coast has prevented her parents from coming to the UK to hear the jury's verdict and to take their daughter home. Instead, Anna must wait a while more in a country that failed her terribly, a place which for this child proved less safe than her own trouble-torn country.",

      "body": "<p>Separate doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are not a safe alternative to the combined MMR jab, which some parents have shunned because of scares over alleged links to autism and bowel disease, government and independent scientists said yesterday.</p> <p>The heads of the independent Joint Committee on Immunisation and Vaccination (JCVI) and the Committee on the Safety of Medicines, as well as the government's head of immunisation, came together to warn that obtaining individual vaccinations for the three diseases involves delay, which exposes children to the real and increasing risk of infection. Last week the government said that low rates of immunisation could shortly lead to a fatal measles outbreak, as it did last year in Ireland, where there were two deaths, and the Netherlands, where there were three.</p> <p>Michael Langman, head of the JCVI, said there were also worries about some of the individual vaccines available in other European countries. Some parents in Britain have gone abroad for supplies of separate vaccines because of the MMR scare.</p> <p>\"The mumps vaccine in France is the Urabe vaccine, which is one we have abandoned in the UK because of a distinct, though small, risk of meningitis,\" he said. He added that there were doubts about the efficacy of the measles vaccine used in Switzerland and that high potency measles vaccines used in the past had been withdrawn by the World Health Organisation. The main measles vaccine used in Europe is, however, the same one used in the MMR jab.</p> <p>The government has banned individual vaccines from the NHS, but some private clinics have imported supplies.</p> <p>The scientists cited Japan as proof that single vaccinations do not protect the population as well as the combined MMR. In Japan, which has single measles and rubella injections, there were 79 deaths from measles between 1992 and 1997. There have been no deaths in Britain since 1990.</p> <p>The two committees had again reviewed the safety data for the MMR vaccination, the scientists said, and concluded that the combined jab was the safest way to protect children.</p> <p>They cited a 14-year follow-up study of children immunised with MMR in Finland, released last month, which found only 173 potentially serious reactions in 1.8m children vaccinated. Nearly half those reactions were probably caused by other things. The most serious were cases of encephalitis, of which there were three.</p> <p>The authors of the study say they found \"no cases of inflammatory bowel disease or autism\" linked to MMR.</p> <p>\"This finding is important because were there an association with MMR vaccination after such a short interval as suggested, this prospective study design would undoubtedly have disclosed at least some cases,\" they write in the Paediatric Infectious Diseases Journal.</p> <p>The scientists were mounting a pre-emptive strike ahead of a further study to be published by Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free hospital in London. Dr Wakefield first suggested a link between MMR, bowel disease and autism in a paper which caused uproar when it was published in the Lancet in February 1998.</p> <p>Dr Wakefield's next paper is expected to question the clinical trials that were carried out to ensure the safety and efficacy of the combined MMR before it was licensed in 1972. He is expected to claim that the trials were inadequate, the follow-up data was collected over too short a period and that the vaccines can interact.</p> <p>Alasdair Breckenridge, chairman of the Committee on the Safety of Medicines, insisted there was sufficient evidence of MMR's safety available in 1972, and that there was far more evidence now that more than 500m doses have been given to children worldwide.</p> <p>David Salisbury, head of immunisation at the Department of Health, said officials were concerned about further scare stories. \"This would be a really unfortunate time to have coverage go down when we really need to be working our hardest to get coverage up,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Separate doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are not a safe alternative to the combined MMR jab, which some parents have shunned because of scares over alleged links to autism and bowel disease, government and independent scientists said yesterday. The heads of the independent Joint Committee on Immunisation and Vaccination (JCVI) and the Committee on the Safety of Medicines, as well as the government's head of immunisation, came together to warn that obtaining individual vaccinations for the three diseases involves delay, which exposes children to the real and increasing risk of infection. Last week the government said that low rates of immunisation could shortly lead to a fatal measles outbreak, as it did last year in Ireland, where there were two deaths, and the Netherlands, where there were three. Michael Langman, head of the JCVI, said there were also worries about some of the individual vaccines available in other European countries. Some parents in Britain have gone abroad for supplies of separate vaccines because of the MMR scare. \"The mumps vaccine in France is the Urabe vaccine, which is one we have abandoned in the UK because of a distinct, though small, risk of meningitis,\" he said. He added that there were doubts about the efficacy of the measles vaccine used in Switzerland and that high potency measles vaccines used in the past had been withdrawn by the World Health Organisation. The main measles vaccine used in Europe is, however, the same one used in the MMR jab. The government has banned individual vaccines from the NHS, but some private clinics have imported supplies. The scientists cited Japan as proof that single vaccinations do not protect the population as well as the combined MMR. In Japan, which has single measles and rubella injections, there were 79 deaths from measles between 1992 and 1997. There have been no deaths in Britain since 1990. The two committees had again reviewed the safety data for the MMR vaccination, the scientists said, and concluded that the combined jab was the safest way to protect children. They cited a 14-year follow-up study of children immunised with MMR in Finland, released last month, which found only 173 potentially serious reactions in 1.8m children vaccinated. Nearly half those reactions were probably caused by other things. The most serious were cases of encephalitis, of which there were three. The authors of the study say they found \"no cases of inflammatory bowel disease or autism\" linked to MMR. \"This finding is important because were there an association with MMR vaccination after such a short interval as suggested, this prospective study design would undoubtedly have disclosed at least some cases,\" they write in the Paediatric Infectious Diseases Journal. The scientists were mounting a pre-emptive strike ahead of a further study to be published by Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free hospital in London. Dr Wakefield first suggested a link between MMR, bowel disease and autism in a paper which caused uproar when it was published in the Lancet in February 1998. Dr Wakefield's next paper is expected to question the clinical trials that were carried out to ensure the safety and efficacy of the combined MMR before it was licensed in 1972. He is expected to claim that the trials were inadequate, the follow-up data was collected over too short a period and that the vaccines can interact. Alasdair Breckenridge, chairman of the Committee on the Safety of Medicines, insisted there was sufficient evidence of MMR's safety available in 1972, and that there was far more evidence now that more than 500m doses have been given to children worldwide. David Salisbury, head of immunisation at the Department of Health, said officials were concerned about further scare stories. \"This would be a really unfortunate time to have coverage go down when we really need to be working our hardest to get coverage up,\" he said.",

The threat posed by the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to \"rogue\" states and terrorists is identified by a Pentagon report, as the biggest challenge to American and global security since the end of the Cold War. This assessment, strongly supported by President-elect George W Bush's nominee as defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, Vice President-elect Dick Cheney, and by Republican hawks in Congress, now looks certain to be the springboard for a big new defence build-up under the Bush administration that takes office a week from today (jan 20). \"At least 25 countries now possess - or are in the process of acquiring and developing - capabilities to inflict mass casualties and destruction,\" said William Cohen, the current US defence secretary and former Republican senator, in a foreword to the Pentagon report. \"Our unrivalled supremacy in the conventional military arena is prompting adversaries to seek unconventional, asymmetric means to strike what they perceive as our Achilles heel,\" Mr Cohen said. He singled out North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Libya as countries whose missile-building programmes and attempts to acquire nuclear, chemical or biological weapons posed the most pressing threats to US and international security. \"Also looming on the horizon is the prospect that terror weapons will increasingly find their way into the hands of individuals and groups of fanatical terrorists or self-proclaimed apocalyptic prophets. The followers of Osama bin Laden have in fact already trained with toxic chemicals,\" Mr Cohen claimed. President-elect George W Bush pledged during last year's election campaign to boost Pentagon spending by $45bn over the next decade and spend up to $70bn on space and submarine-based defensive missiles. But Mr Cohen's comments, this week's Pentagon report, and assessments made by a commission on space weapons convened by President Bill Clinton and by a panel chaired by former senator Howard Baker all make clear that a big push in now under way in Republican-controlled Washington to gain much bigger spending increases. The money is intended to fund anti-proliferation efforts, missile defences, and new generations of \"big ticket\" delivery platforms such as \"stealth\" destroyers and submarines. Mr Rumsfeld warned Congress this week that after a decade of static or declining post-Soviet military spending, a big effort was required to counter what he characterised as growing threats to the US and its allies, and in particular to space satellites, from \"rogue\" states and terrorist groups. \"Forces in world politics have created a more diverse and less predictable set of potential adversaries,\" Mr Rumsfeld told the Senate armed services committee. \"I look forward_ to bringing the American military successfully into the 21st century.

Labour is divided over the project which would involve the enhancement of US radar tracking facilities at Fylingdales in North Yorkshire. But William Hague pledged yesterday(fri) that a Conservative government would back the US project, which, he said, was necessary, as the world entered a \"second nuclear age\". Russia and China, as well as some of America's European Nato allies, are opposed to NMD which they say will breach existing treaties, bring to a halt 25 years of largely successful offensive arms control negotiations, and provoke a new global arms race. Among the concerns fuelling the new military build-up is the perceived failure to protect American space satellites. The space weaponry commission set up by Mr Clinton and until recently chaired by Mr Rumsfeld warned that the US potentially faced \"a space Pearl Harbor\" It pointed to relatively cheap micro-satellites that could be used by US enemies to disrupt or destroy orbiting satellites considered vital for military surveillance, intelligence-gathering, and information systems. The separate inquiry led by Howard Baker has meanwhile warned that Russia's large nuclear, chemical and biological weapons stockpiles are dangerously insecure and vulner able to theft and smuggling by terrorist groups and Russian mafia syndicates. The Pentagon report entitled Proliferation: Threat and Response focuses on several key areas of concern: Transnational: \"The increased availability of dual-use technologies, coupled with the relative ease of producing some chemical and biological agents, has increased concern that use of chemical or biological weapons may become attractive to terrorist groups intent on causing panic or inflicting large numbers of casualties.\" It singles out the terrorist network headed by the Afghanistan-based Saudi millionaire Osama Bin Laden as a particular threat, linking it to terrorist activity in Bosnia, Chechnya, Sudan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Libya, Pakistan and the Philippines. States of Concern: The report provides a detailed breakdown of attempts by Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and others, including Pakistan, Sudan and Syria, to enhance either their missile capability or acquire or augment weapons of mass destruction (WMD). It predicts, for example, that should sanctions be lifted against Iraq, Saddam Hussein could have an operational offensive nuclear weapon within five years. The report says that nuclear-armed India and Pakistan are engaged in a regional arms race that could have catastrophic consequences reaching far beyond the subcontinent.

BMD involves a bewildering array of weapons systems, either already deployed, in production, or on the Pentagon's wish-list,including airborne lasers, and National Missile Defence. \"The NMD program is tasked to develop, demonstrate and if ordered to do so, deploy an NMD system to defend all 50 states against limited strategic ballistic missile attacks from a country of proliferation concern,\" the report states. \"Should a decision be made to deploy the NMD system, the department of defense(correct) expects to achieve Initial Operating Capability (IOC) shortly after 2005.\"",

      "body": "<p>In the world according to the Pentagon, apocalypse is always just around the corner. In its latest survey of global menaces, Proliferation: Threat and Response, the US defence department presents a scary picture of multiplying offensive missile systems, accelerating regional nuclear arms races, ever more easily obtained (and murderous) chemical and biological weapons, and stateless fanatics dedicated to worldwide mayhem.</p> <p>Military men never feel totally secure. If they did, they would lose their raison d'etre. Thus while the success of efforts to reduce the Soviet warhead arsenal is acknowledged, this achievement is tempered by gloom about clandestine transfers of hardware and expertise from present-day Russia to rogue \"states of concern\". And while China is praised, for example, for curbing nuclear cooperation with Iran and tightening its chemical weapons export controls, the Pentagon still warns sombrely that Beijing \"remains one of the world's key sources for missile-related technologies\" and will continue to use arms sales \"to advance its strategic and economic interests\". That the US, the world leader in missile technology, never ceases to do precisely this at every opportunity is an irony apparently lost on America's analysts. Unnoticed, too, when it comes to Iraq's destabilising \"pursuit of regional hegemony\", is the contradiction inherent in America's uncritical attitude to Israel's unmatched nuclear weapons programme. The report notes elsewhere that roguish Syria spends about $1bn annually on defence. But it does not publicise the equivalent US total: about $300bn.</p> <p>Despite these blindspots, the Pentagon report has to be taken very seriously on two counts. One is the light it sheds on the undoubted dangers posed by the spread of weapons of mass destruction. It argues, for example, that North Korea, despite the thaw with the South, continues to deploy large, \"offensively-oriented\" forces along the common border, has the capacity to make at least one nuclear bomb, and is increasing its missile capabilities at a steady pace. Pyongyang, says the report, has also assembled a large stockpile of chemical precursors and chemical warfare agents. Iran, aided by North Korea and Russia, is said to be moving aggressively towards nuclear weapons and biological warfare capabilities; Sudan and Libya give rise to similar worries. When it comes to India and Pakistan, the report detects a \"nuclear and missiles arms race ... with consequences that are difficult to predict and (with) potential for spillover beyond the subcontinent\". When the activities of freelance terrorist groups like that led by Osama bin Laden are factored in, all this adds up to what that report calls a daunting worldwide challenge.</p> <p>Which brings us to the second reason why this Pentagon analysis has to be taken very seriously.

      "bodyText": "In the world according to the Pentagon, apocalypse is always just around the corner. In its latest survey of global menaces, Proliferation: Threat and Response, the US defence department presents a scary picture of multiplying offensive missile systems, accelerating regional nuclear arms races, ever more easily obtained (and murderous) chemical and biological weapons, and stateless fanatics dedicated to worldwide mayhem. Military men never feel totally secure. If they did, they would lose their raison d'etre. Thus while the success of efforts to reduce the Soviet warhead arsenal is acknowledged, this achievement is tempered by gloom about clandestine transfers of hardware and expertise from present-day Russia to rogue \"states of concern\". And while China is praised, for example, for curbing nuclear cooperation with Iran and tightening its chemical weapons export controls, the Pentagon still warns sombrely that Beijing \"remains one of the world's key sources for missile-related technologies\" and will continue to use arms sales \"to advance its strategic and economic interests\". That the US, the world leader in missile technology, never ceases to do precisely this at every opportunity is an irony apparently lost on America's analysts. Unnoticed, too, when it comes to Iraq's destabilising \"pursuit of regional hegemony\", is the contradiction inherent in America's uncritical attitude to Israel's unmatched nuclear weapons programme. The report notes elsewhere that roguish Syria spends about $1bn annually on defence. But it does not publicise the equivalent US total: about $300bn. Despite these blindspots, the Pentagon report has to be taken very seriously on two counts. One is the light it sheds on the undoubted dangers posed by the spread of weapons of mass destruction. It argues, for example, that North Korea, despite the thaw with the South, continues to deploy large, \"offensively-oriented\" forces along the common border, has the capacity to make at least one nuclear bomb, and is increasing its missile capabilities at a steady pace. Pyongyang, says the report, has also assembled a large stockpile of chemical precursors and chemical warfare agents. Iran, aided by North Korea and Russia, is said to be moving aggressively towards nuclear weapons and biological warfare capabilities; Sudan and Libya give rise to similar worries. When it comes to India and Pakistan, the report detects a \"nuclear and missiles arms race ... with consequences that are difficult to predict and (with) potential for spillover beyond the subcontinent\". When the activities of freelance terrorist groups like that led by Osama bin Laden are factored in, all this adds up to what that report calls a daunting worldwide challenge. Which brings us to the second reason why this Pentagon analysis has to be taken very seriously. Just as the cold war gave rise to new generations of offensive missiles, the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction - accurately assessed or not - is now the principal justification for the next big US military expansion: into the multi-layered realm of defensive missiles and expensive new launch platforms like \"stealth\" destroyers and submarines and space-based vehicles. US National Missile Defence plans, rashly endorsed yesterday by William Hague, get only a small mention here. But they are an integral, and in the Pentagon view, clearly an essential part of the massive, many-pronged counter-proliferation programme now gathering pace in Washington.

Special Branch and CID will be merged on April 1, the force will be reorganised into district divisions, and Sir Ronnie intends to advertise soon for around 200 recruits to start training in September and be fully fledged officers in the new Police Service of Northern Ireland by early next year. Nationalists view policing changes as a central part of the Good Friday agreement and the SDLP welcomed Chris Patten's plan for a radical overhaul of the overwhelmingly male-dominated force, which is more than 90% Protestant and many Catholics believe is biased towards unionists. But they have accused the government of drastically watering down the Patten plan and say they do not have enough confidence in the current legislation to recommend young Catholics to join the new service.

The SDLP also wants the Gough barracks interrogation centre in Armagh to be shut, and Sir Ronnie said he was working toward this in the near future although it was a matter of getting alternative accommodation sorted out. He also pointed out that a new UK-wide law, the Regulation of Investigative Powers Act, passed in October meant undercover policing and surveillance activities were already subject to much greater external scrutiny than before. The police bill's requirement that recruitment be on a 50/50 Protestant/Catholic basis could prove extremely problematic without widespread nationalist support. But Sir Ronnie said it was imperative to start advertising for new officers as soon as possible because of the large numbers already leaving the force as a result of the downsizing plan outlined in the reforms, which aims to eventually cut the 13,500-strong force to about 7,500. \"Non-recruitment is not an option,\" he said. \"We are on the point of selecting an independent recruitment agency and just because there is no police board doesn't mean we can't advertise.

      "bodyText": "Marie Therese Kouao, who clutched a Bible as she was taken from the dock to begin her prison sentence, appeared to believe that Anna was possessed by evil spirits. This belief, which served as an excuse for the girl's brutalised condition, was allowed to flourish by a series of evangelical churches Anna was taken to by her abuser. Anna was made to repeat the story that she was possessed by demons and that Satan was making her injure herself. The church that played a crucial role in this was the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, a global Christian sect which tells its followers that diseases are caused by demons. The sect, which last year bought the London-based Liberty Radio from Mohamed Al Fayed, is surrounded by controversy; its Brazilian founder is at the centre of corruption allegations. Founded by shop assistant Edir Macedo in 1977, the Protestant evangelical movement has grown to acquire millions of followers. It claims 4,500 regular members in Britain and has established a headquarters at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, north London. A week before her death last February Anna was brought to the theatre where the church advertises a \"deliverance service\" offering exorcism for those troubled by spirits. Anna's frail body was completely covered in black clothing and she interrupted the service to say she was possessed. Kouao told the assistant pastor, Alvero Lima, 21, that witchcraft had followed Anna from Ivory Coast. Mr Lima told Kouao the girl had a \"spiritual problem\" and said he would fast for her. They should return for a Friday service, the pastor said, at which they would try to cast out the evil spirits. But the day before the service Kouao drove Anna, who was barely conscious, to the church. Mr Lima realised Anna was ill and advised Kouao to take her to hospital. She died the next day. Kouao told doctors that when she had called the church earlier she was told Anna had a \"bad spirit\" and she should leave her alone. She had lost faith in modern medicine and had taken Anna to a church to rid her of \"itchiness\" through prayer. A spokeswoman for the Universal Church said that medical studies had acknowledged the positive effects of prayer on health. The Evangelical Alliance described Anna's death as tragic and warned churches to take great care in dealing with people who believe they are possessed.",

      "bodyText": "Detectives looking into alleged collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and security forces in Ulster have for the first time acknowledged the existence of an army double agent, codenamed Stakeknife, who was working in the top echelons of the IRA. Hugh Orde, the Scotland Yard commander leading the inquiry, will almost certainly have to broaden the scope of his investigation to include Stakeknife - a move which will horrify the Ministry of Defence. The MoD's sensitivity about the agent has already led to injunctions being served on two national newspapers. It has never previously admitted having such a highly placed informer in the IRA. To the RUC's concern, it has emerged that the army was running its own network of informants to protect soldiers who, they argued, were as vulnerable to attack as the police. The Stevens inquiry was set up to re-investigate the murders of Pat Finucane, a defence solicitor shot by the Ulster Defence Association in February 1989, and 19-year-old Adam Lambert, who was shot the day after the IRA blew up 11 people at Enniskillen in November 1987. The terms of the inquiry are vague - it orders an investigation into \"collusion\" - which means Cdr Orde has the scope to look into allegations involving republicans and loyalists. Last month he spoke to relatives of Francisco Notarantonio, who was shot dead on October 9, 1987, at his home in west Belfast. It is thought Notarantonio, 66, was suggested as a target by the army to deflect the UDA from shooting Stakeknife. The loyalists had unwittingly put the agent on a list of senior republican targets without knowing his importance. Cdr Orde told the family he believed Stakeknife exists, saying he had uncovered details of a \"high-level informant which would fit the description of Stakeknife\". Last night Cdr Orde confirmed he has spoken with the Notarantonio family, and added: \"I have been on the record to say I believe the agent exists.\"",

Here are the thoughts of Dr Johnson, a familiar figure in this part of London 250 years ago, writing about his friend Richard Savage: </p> <p>\"A superstitious Regard to the Correction of his Sheets was one of Mr Savage's Peculiarities; he often altered, revised, recurred to his first Reading or Punctuation, and again adopted the Alteration; he was dubious and irresolute without End, as on a Question of the last Importance, and at last was seldom satisfied; the Intrusion or Omission of a Comma was sufficient to discompose him, and he would lament an Error of a single Letter as a heavy Calamity.\" Johnson, the historian Richard Holmes tells us, \"noted this Quixotic desire for perfect type-setting with shrewd amusement\". </p> <p>We work in haste and do not, no matter how fretful we may get, have time for that degree of fastidiousness. The figures we have compiled lump all categories of error together and do not differentiate the serious and the less consequential (you may say trivial). </p> <p>During the year there were almost 1,500 entries in the corrections column, nearly half arising from four main areas. These are pages 1,2 and 3, which are treated as a unit with their own production team (124 corrections); the home news pages, the biggest part of the paper (267); the foreign pages (121); and G2, the tabloid second section (245), excluding the arts pages, the women's, style and parents pages and the Guide pages with the television programmes, which were all counted separately. </p> <p>The G2 total, considering it was produced largely by its general feature pages and columns (8,000 to 10,000 words a day), could not be considered good. Not surprisingly the months of August and September, last year, when G2 was understaffed, showed a sharp rise. </p> <p>Here are the figures for some of the other high-profile sections: the comment and analysis pages, excluding letters, 70; letters, 25; obituaries and birthdays, 79; City 51; sport 74.

The tomato follows the chocolate \u00e9clair that burst over Nick Brown at a farmers' meeting last February, and the more traditional custard pie that scored a direct hit on Ann Widdecombe when she visited Oxford. Instructively, all seem to have been hurled by women. </p> <p>I worry about this development, since it may be used by politicians as an excuse to duck out of traditional meetings at which opponents are present and to shelter instead within hand-picked congregations. Others, however, glory in it. \"I cannot believe I am alone\", Boris Johnson wrote in the Daily Bigot, \"in my exultation in reimagining the moment of impact: the splat of the squidgy red projectile, the explosion of seeds, the sudden soaking of the Armani, the momentary clouding of that maddening grin and its replacement by a wondering frown.\" </p> <p>This Johnson, I understand, will himself be standing in the coming election, as the Conservative candidate for Henley. Henley, I understand, is particularly well equipped with greengrocer's shops stocking squidgy projectiles. There are also several excellent pastry cooks. </p> <p> The editor of the Times, returning after illness, lost no time in disposing of Stephen Pollard, recruited from the Express, after Pollard had smuggled a message expressing his hatred of its new proprietor into that newspaper. How long, then, I wonder, is he going to tolerate the paper's new diarist, Giles Coren, who on January 2 concluded his contribution with the following thought: \"Did you think the diary was a bit ropey today? Yes, well, did you go to work yesterday? No? Shut up, then.\" </p> <p>On Thursday this week, he had each of his items assessed by a visiting reader called Tripp, who scored each one out of 10. The marks he awarded were three, two and one, which in my view was madly generous. Giles is the son of the veteran Times columnist Alan Coren, which just goes to show how right the Guardian is in its distrust of the hereditary principle. Still worse, though, was a column this week by the paper's teenage prodigy and former fawner-in-chief over Michael Portillo, Michael Gove, who, holding forth on the decline (as he sees it) in social and legal attitudes to the sanctity of life, wrote: \"When we face the enormity of Harold Shipman's dispatch of his frail and vulnerable victims, our capacity to condemn appropriately is limited.\" </p> <p>Let him speak for himself. Smallweed's imagination is haunted by a picture of all Shipman's victims, some very aged, others who might have expected many good years before them, arrayed in their serried ranks in some kind of field with, behind them, the even more numerous congregation of those deprived of loved parents and grandparents. What does Gove expect me to do to express my condemnation? Organise a lynch mob and march on the jail? </p> <p> And now - it cannot be avoided, given the number of issues that readers have raised - back to the London suburb of Acton. Did I know that Acton had seven railway stations, including ones for all four points of the compass? Well, sort of; though East Acton station is not in Acton. Did I know that at least one laundry survives in the area known as Soapsuds Island, and possibly two? No, but I'm glad to hear it. Did I know that Acton used to be big in ice-cream? No, but ditto. Is the 94 bus a product of Smallweed's fevered imagination? (This from one who waits regularly at a bus stop which proclaims the existence of such a bus, but claims that none ever comes.) Why did I describe Prince Kropotkin as a nihilist, instead of an optimistic anarchist? Was I led astray by Chambers Biographical Dictionary? (Yes.) Why did I woundingly fail to distinguish between Acton W3, which is mere Acton, and Acton W4, which claims the right to call itself Chiswick? And so on. </p> <p>I'm intrigued, by the way, that the woman (name unknown) who was married to the son of Osama bin Laden at a fun-packed ceremony in Kandahar was not herself present for the occasion. Could she, perhaps, like the new bride of Syria's president, be an Acton girl? Maybe she missed out on Kandahar because she was stuck at a bus stop, waiting for the elusive 94. </p> <p> I am also rebuked for having, in my assessment of Acton, failed to mention the great historian John Emerich Edward Dalberg, first baron Acton of Aldenham. I omitted him on the wimpish grounds that as far as I know he had nothing to do with Acton W3 or, for that matter, W4. He is best known today for his teaching that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, though what he actually said was a shade more cautious: power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. This is probably the most famous line ever written in a letter dispatched to a bishop, the bishop being Mandell Creighton of London. </p> <p>He also wrote in this letter: \"Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority.\" Which deserves to be famous, too, though note again that qualification: almost. Though by nature rather remote, he was MP for Carlow from 1859 to 1865, when he switched to the splendid Shropshire town of Bridgnorth, which he won by one vote, only to be disqualified. In his time at Westminster he made just one speech and asked only two questions. </p> <p>I have space to mention only one other aspect of Acton: his beard. This was one of the most imposing beards in late Victorian politics, a match, I would guess, even for the Marquess of Salisbury's - capacious enough, statisticians tell me, to conceal a small laundry or even a 94 bus. The Acton Institute for the study of religion and liberty, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, celebrates him on its website, though whether or not he'd approve of them is another matter. </p> <p>They market a book by Marvin Olansky, who is said to have brought George W Bush round to compassionate conservatism, through something they call the Acton Book Shoppe. That doesn't sound very John Emerich Edward Dalberg to me.</p> <p><a href=\"MAILTO:Smallweed@theguardian.com\">Smallweed@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Stock markets are cyclical and a new issue market can freeze up entirely. It is no surprise that there is currently no appetite among investors for tech company flotations. </p> <p>But our banker is screwed because there is little prospect of any other type of corporate work for tech stocks. Investors appear unwilling to risk throwing good money after bad by subscribing for second or third round fundraisings by existing quoted companies. And any M&amp;A work is unlikely to have big advisory fees attached because the companies concerned just cannot afford to pay them. </p> <p>Our banker is no mug. He may or may not deserve to beat the cut when his American parent wields the axe, but he recognises that redundancy programmes are notoriously fickle processes. Better to engineer a career change now than have one forced upon him at a time when the City is likely to be awash with underemployed and unemployed tech specialists. </p> <p>The City excels in gallows humour. You have heard the new definition of B2C? Back-to-consultancy, of course. B2B? Back-to-banking.

But they have to accept that the risks attached to companies without a track record of public scrutiny on the stock market are greater than for those that have. </p> <p>The response of investment bankers who sponsor new issues and handle the attendant fundraisings is to price IPOs at a discount to comparable companies already listed on stock exchanges. However, the statistics show that this discount is instantly corrected in the first few days of dealing and is then followed by prolonged underperformance - justifying fears of higher risks for unknown entities. </p> <p>A recent study by one of my colleagues revealed that over the past 10 years UK IPOs averaged a 28% gain on the first day of dealings, but subsequently underperformed their relevant peers by an average 15% over the next three years. International experience has been similar. The average US new issue has lost 20% relative ground in the three-year, post-float period. </p> <p>It is too early to assess the aftermarket performance of last year's IPOs.

In the US only four investment banks saw the new issues they sponsored close the year at a premium to flotation prices. The various TMT sectors averaged IPO price falls by year-end of 34-56%. </p> <p>Last year had been shaping up to be a bumper year for new issues. The finely honed abacus wielded by KPMG totted up 138 IPOs on the main market in the UK last year - a record number raising a record \u00a310.6bn.

If history proceeds to repeat itself, then there is a lot of pent-up disappointment to be dumped on investors over the next couple of years. </p> <p>This need not necessarily imply that the new issue will be stone dead over this period.

The scars will act as a reminder to investors to focus on reality when assessing prospects for prospective new issues. </p> <p>So, back to our nervy banker.

      "bodyText": "It's been a stirring if theologically challenging week for the bearded bigwigs of Russian Orthodoxy. The second most important date in the Orthodox calendar fell last weekend; the churches and cathedrals of Moscow were bursting at the seams with people celebrating a very white Orthodox Christmas. Round the corner from where I live, the newly built Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, the jewel in the crown of contemporary Orthodoxy looming imperiously on the Moscow skyline, was packed with 6,000 of the faithful, including Vladimir Putin and a couple of high-profile visitors from Berlin, Gerhard and Doris Schr\u00f6der. There was incense and candles, and the cathedral was decked out in sprigs of fir. The Russians are very good at pomp, mystery and awe-inspiring devotion. But there was also something strangely unorthodox about the presence of Grandfather Frost and his Snowmaiden partner at Jesus Christ's birthday party in the cathedral. Like all things western, Santa Claus has recently been flooding Russia with his gospel of unbridled consumerism and shop-till-you-drop doctrine. But you couldn't catch Santa at any of the Russian church festivities. Jealously guarding its restoration to the centre of Russian life, the church's hierarchy is a bastion of anti-westernism, suspicious of the Vatican, and contemptuous of Hollywood. Santa Claus, therefore, is persona non grata. Which is where Grandfather Frost, an unreconstructed pagan and perhaps a communist to boot, comes in. He and Snowmaiden are the traditional Russian equivalents of Santa, essentially the spirits of the winter solstice. The trouble is they are decidedly unChristian; they were originally pagan, appropriated by Stalin, the destroyer of the Russian church, as a secular substitute for the New Year holiday. In 16th-century rural Russia, Frost was the pagan winter wood sprite; Snowmaiden was his offspring who perished every spring when the thaw set in. By the 19th century, Frost had acquired grandfather status and Snowmaiden had transformed into his granddaughter, not least thanks to the playwright Alexander Ostrovsky, who devoted a theatre piece to the girl. In 1917 the killjoy Bolsheviks summarily turned both fairy-tale figures into non-persons and banned fir trees as the symbol of the New Year. Stalin, however, relented in the 1930s, mobilising the trees and the pagan spirits for the secular festival, while smashing the church and abolishing Christmas. So when the church hierarchy allowed granddad and the girl into the children's Orthodox Christmas party in the basement of the grand cathedral on Tuesday, eyebrows were raised and questions asked. There was a large fir tree illuminated by laser angels and saints; the Ten Commandments played a central role in the kids' party. But in a bow to all things Russian ancient and superstitious as well as modern and secular, the wood sprites were also allowed to take part. Patriarch Aleksy II himself had given his blessing to their participation. Up in the north of Russia, Vyacheslav Pozgalov, the governor of the Vologda region, rails at the west and argues that Grandfather Frost is a key to Russia rediscovering its soul. \"Today we see the intellectual degradation of the nation. The intellect and the spirituality of our people are collapsing rapidly on a mass scale. Western ideology is deliberately washing it away. For us, Grandfather Frost is not a commercial, but an ideological project.\" This is a view to which the bearded bigwigs fully subscribe.

With more than 100 stores, observers insist there would be no shortage of interest should Mr Morrison decide to hoist the For Sale sign. It is perhaps reasonable to assume that he will eventually make his exit and, with the succession looking far from obvious, a bid battle could well ensue. The plain talking Yorkshireman may be dismissive of takeover talk, but he is not reticent when it comes to the planning laws which he insists are strangling the development of his business. The food sector has benefited greatly from the recent swing away from technology companies, but the sector is notoriously competitive because most of the growth is generated by persuading your competitors' customers to switch sides. That aside, Morrison looks like a strong performer, but anyone thinking of opening their wallet should do so in the knowledge that the company probably will not ever generate bumper profits. But regular, gradually increasing returns can be expected.",

A hooded man carrying a long-barrelled gun and wearing a blue boiler suit pushed past her.</p> <p>Another man in a balaclava stood behind him. \"I shouted, 'What's wrong, what's the matter?'\" said Edith, now 73.</p> <p>\"Francisco jumped up, half out of bed with his hands up and open. He was shot in the chest. He fell forward on the bed, and was shot twice in the back.\" The couple had been married for 39 years and had 11 children.</p> <p>\"I thought they were going to kill me too. But they went into another room and shot my grandson in the hand. Then they walked downstairs - walked - and left.\"</p> <p>The murder of Notarantonio on October 9 1987, at the family home in Whitecliff Parade, a staunchly republican estate in Ballymurphy, west Belfast, was horrific, but depressingly, it was hardly extraordinary in a period when sectarian shootings were commonplace.</p> <p>RUC officers told Mrs Notarantonio they hoped to catch the killers within a fortnight. Nobody has been arrested.</p> <p>Her husband's death would probably have been forgotten if it had not been for the suspicions of the family, and revelations from former security force personnel which has put the case at the centre of one of the most intriguing and potentially explosive stories of the Troubles.</p> <p>To begin with, it was assumed Mr Notarantonio had been killed by the loyalist paramilitary outfit, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, who were engaged in a tit-for-tat campaign with republican terrorists. The family thought there was more.</p> <p>\"For days before the shooting, the army was everywhere,\" said Charlotte Notarantonio, Francisco's daughter. \"Just before my father died, the soldiers, the helicopters and the barricades disappeared. It was as if they were clearing the way. And just after the shooting, we also found an army map in the hallway. It must have been dropped by one of the gunman.\"</p> <p>Rumours the military was involved were apparently substantiated last year when a former soldier confirmed that Notarantonio was the innocent victim of a complex conspiracy designed to protect a top double agent.</p> <p>The allegation is that a secret army intelligence squad working in Northern Ireland, the force research unit, infiltrated the Ulster Defence Association using an agent, Brian Nelson, who became the UDA's senior intelligence officer. When Nelson discovered loyalist terrorists were intending to assassinate a senior member of the Provisional IRA, it caused panic in the FRU.</p> <p><b>Intended victim</b><br></p> <p>The intended victim was the army's \"primary source\" spy within the movement, codenamed Stakeknife. To protect Stakeknife, the army allegedly fed false details of Notarantonio to the UDA through Nelson, which suggested the former taxi driver, who had given up work to look after his wife, was an IRA godfather.</p> <p>In fact, Notarantonio had not been actively involved in politics for more than 40 years. The details were passed to the UDA's gunmen, the UFF, who carried out the killing. \"When we heard about Stakeknife, we realised we hadn't just been paranoid about thinking there was collusion,\" said Ms Notarantonio.</p> <p>\"In some ways, it was a relief to think we were getting closer to the truth. But it made us want to fight all the harder. We want to know who ordered my father's death, and how many other people were executed in this way.\"</p> <p>Sir John Stevens, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, was asked to conduct an inquiry into collusion almost two years ago - his third investigation in Northern Ireland - focusing on the murder of Patrick Finucane, a Belfast solicitor shot in front of his wife and children in 1989. Commander Hugh Orde, who is in charge of the day-to-day running of the inquiry, has inevitably been drawn into allegations of collusion in other deaths.</p> <p>He saw the Notarantonio family last month to discuss their case. He told them he has not uncovered any firm evidence - yet - to confirm the claims about the death. But he did say he thought Stakeknife exists, the first acceptance by the police that the army was running a spy at the highest levels of the IRA. Some republicans have questioned whether Stakeknife might be a figment of loyalist imagination, a myth designed to unsettle the movement.</p> <p>This is dismissed by a former member of FRU, a whistleblower who uses the pseudonym Martin Ingram. Until recently, Ingram was a key witness to the Stevens inquiry, but he withdrew his statement because he felt the police were not doing nearly enough to protect him and his family.</p> <p>Last year, his house was burgled in mysterious circumstances, and in recent months he has received threatening phone calls warning him not to give further information about the covert activities of FRU.</p> <p>\"The circumstances of the Notarantonio murder are 100% true,\" said Ingram yesterday. \"I was working in the FRU at the time, though I wasn't involved.</p> <p>\"I knew there was targeting of Stakeknife, and yes, there was panic. The aim was to switch attention to another individual.</p> <p>\"This was the ethos between 1986 and 1989... to try to refine the targeting of loyalist gunmen, which would add to the weaponry of the British army and raise some panic within the republican movement.\" Ingram believes Stakeknife is still operating.</p> <p>His statement to the Stevens inquiry concentrated solely on what he knew about the double agent, none of which has been reported in the newspapers.</p> <p>\"I have been extremely responsible in what I have said about Stakeknife. It's such a major problem for the army. They are running an agent who is working against the interests of one section of society.\"</p> <p>Ingram believes the setting up of the Stevens inquiry was the very least that should have been done to unravel what was going on in Ulster at that time.</p> <p>\"A public inquiry would be better, or some form of truth and reconciliation commission.\"</p> <p>He has also been dismissive of leaks to the Guardian suggesting the Stevens team will finish its investigation by concluding FRU was acting \"on its own\", \"or in a maverick fashion\".</p> <p>To blame FRU for breaking the rules, would be a nonsense, he says, because there were no rules.</p> <p>\"The army is a bureaucratic organisation which needs funding. There is structure and there is accountability. You cannot finance an organisation like that without people knowing exactly what FRU was doing.\"</p> <p>Although the withdrawal of Ingram's statement and cooperation was a blow, Scotland Yard sources insist the inquiry is still progressing.</p> <p>\"Ingram was just one strand. We've not lost all hope we'll get him back.\"</p> <p>The next three months, however, are likely to be critical for the Stevens team.</p> <p>In the spring, Billy Stobie, from Glencairn in Belfast, will go to court to face charges of aiding and abetting others to murder Pat Finucane and a teenager, Adam Lambert. Stobie will claim he was an RUC special branch agent when Finucane was killed, and warned his handlers Finucane was a target.</p> <p>If the case gets before a jury - there is likely to be furious debate over abuse of process - it could give an extraordinary insight into the murky world of counter-intelligence.</p> <p>Mr Orde is also working his way through a list of 25 former FRU soldiers, summoning them for interviews to discuss their duties.</p> <p>Last, and most importantly, he will question the former commander of the unit, Brigadier Gordon Kerr - known as \"Colonel J\" - who is currently the military attache to the British embassy in Beijing.</p> <p>Then, Mr Orde will set about writing his report.</p> <p>\"We're getting there,\" said a Scotland Yard source. \"Things are just beginning to hot up.\"</p> <p><b>Undercover operators</b></p> <p>The Force Research Unit was one of three army-sponsored undercover intelligence squads in Northern Ireland. The others were 22 squadron SAS, and 14 Company. They are at the heart of claims that the army was involved in organising state-sponsored assassinations.</p> <p>The FRU, set up in Northern Ireland in 1980, dealt with recruiting and handling agents in paramilitary organisations. 14 Company specialised in surveillance while 22 SAS undertook \"executive actions\".</p> <p>FRU was divided into detachments - north, south, east and west. Headquarters FRU dealt only with material supplied by Stakeknife. Overall, FRU had a complement of about 100 soldiers.

Until recently, Ingram was a key witness to the Stevens inquiry, but he withdrew his statement because he felt the police were not doing nearly enough to protect him and his family. Last year, his house was burgled in mysterious circumstances, and in recent months he has received threatening phone calls warning him not to give further information about the covert activities of FRU. \"The circumstances of the Notarantonio murder are 100% true,\" said Ingram yesterday. \"I was working in the FRU at the time, though I wasn't involved. \"I knew there was targeting of Stakeknife, and yes, there was panic. The aim was to switch attention to another individual. \"This was the ethos between 1986 and 1989... to try to refine the targeting of loyalist gunmen, which would add to the weaponry of the British army and raise some panic within the republican movement.\" Ingram believes Stakeknife is still operating. His statement to the Stevens inquiry concentrated solely on what he knew about the double agent, none of which has been reported in the newspapers. \"I have been extremely responsible in what I have said about Stakeknife. It's such a major problem for the army. They are running an agent who is working against the interests of one section of society.\" Ingram believes the setting up of the Stevens inquiry was the very least that should have been done to unravel what was going on in Ulster at that time. \"A public inquiry would be better, or some form of truth and reconciliation commission.\" He has also been dismissive of leaks to the Guardian suggesting the Stevens team will finish its investigation by concluding FRU was acting \"on its own\", \"or in a maverick fashion\". To blame FRU for breaking the rules, would be a nonsense, he says, because there were no rules. \"The army is a bureaucratic organisation which needs funding. There is structure and there is accountability. You cannot finance an organisation like that without people knowing exactly what FRU was doing.\" Although the withdrawal of Ingram's statement and cooperation was a blow, Scotland Yard sources insist the inquiry is still progressing. \"Ingram was just one strand. We've not lost all hope we'll get him back.\" The next three months, however, are likely to be critical for the Stevens team. In the spring, Billy Stobie, from Glencairn in Belfast, will go to court to face charges of aiding and abetting others to murder Pat Finucane and a teenager, Adam Lambert. Stobie will claim he was an RUC special branch agent when Finucane was killed, and warned his handlers Finucane was a target. If the case gets before a jury - there is likely to be furious debate over abuse of process - it could give an extraordinary insight into the murky world of counter-intelligence. Mr Orde is also working his way through a list of 25 former FRU soldiers, summoning them for interviews to discuss their duties. Last, and most importantly, he will question the former commander of the unit, Brigadier Gordon Kerr - known as \"Colonel J\" - who is currently the military attache to the British embassy in Beijing. Then, Mr Orde will set about writing his report. \"We're getting there,\" said a Scotland Yard source. \"Things are just beginning to hot up.\" Undercover operators The Force Research Unit was one of three army-sponsored undercover intelligence squads in Northern Ireland. The others were 22 squadron SAS, and 14 Company. They are at the heart of claims that the army was involved in organising state-sponsored assassinations. The FRU, set up in Northern Ireland in 1980, dealt with recruiting and handling agents in paramilitary organisations. 14 Company specialised in surveillance while 22 SAS undertook \"executive actions\". FRU was divided into detachments - north, south, east and west. Headquarters FRU dealt only with material supplied by Stakeknife. Overall, FRU had a complement of about 100 soldiers. Stakeknife was said to have been paid \u00a375,000 a year via an account in Gibraltar",

Salvage work is to begin in April and, weather permitting, should be completed by August, said officials of the Kursk Foundation, marshalling unique maritime heavy-lifting and towing equipment for the complex project. The submarine's shattered nose cone will be cut off and left 108 metres below the surface. Russian experts will deal with the 24 cruise missiles on board, which Moscow insists are not carrying nuclear warheads. \"There is no question that the boat should not be left alone on the bottom of the sea,\" said the former Soviet foreign minister Alexander Bessmertnykh, who chairs the international foundation with a former Dutch defence minister, Willem van Eekelen. Russia has reassured the international community that the two nuclear reactors on board were automatically shut down when the vessel exploded and sank. But there are fears that the environment will suffer after radioactive leakage is caused by corrosive seawater and strong currents if the submarine is left untouched for too long. The foundation is after funding support from the US, Japan and Canada for the operation. But Brussels is a special target, with high-level talks between the EU and Russia due in Moscow next week. \"The EU and the Swedish presidency have indicated that relations with Russia are a high priority,\" said foundation spokesman David Webber. \"Now they have a chance to show their commitment.\" American, Russian and Dutch companies will be involved in the three-stage recovery operation, in which the Kursk will be raised, secured and towed to Murmansk. Divers will attach cables to the top of the submarine and a giant barge, specially fitted to tow the 14,000-tonne boat, will make the the three-day voyage. Environmental groups have warned that lifting the Kursk could be too dangerous, risking a breakup which would rupture the reactors' protective casings, endangering fish stocks and local wildlife. Work by a Russian commission investigating the disaster has still not determined what happened. Officials have repeatedly suggested that the Kursk collided with a foreign submarine, but say an internal explosion could also have been the cause.",

Arrested by Stalin's secret police as the Red Army fought the Nazis for Budapest in January 1945, Wallenberg, a \"Swedish Schindler\" who singlehandedly saved thousands of Hungarian Jews from the gas chambers, was spirited away into the Gulag and never heard from again. Ever since, his ghost has haunted Russia and Sweden and his mystery has gnawed at the consciences of Moscow and Stockholm.

Secret mission The Wallenberg saga of heroism and tragedy starts in early 1944 when Europe's Jews were perishing en masse in the Holocaust.

But the Russians, while now admitting criminal conduct, have yet to issue a formal apology to Wallenberg's relatives. 'Heart attack' When the Swedes inquired about Wallenberg, Moscow first answered that he was under Soviet protection, then that he had fallen in the battle for Budapest. Then in an infamous memorandum in 1957, the Soviet Union's longest serving foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko, announced, on the basis of an alleged doctor's certificate, that Wallenberg had died of a heart attack on July 17 1947 in the Lubyanka, the time and place the Russians now say he was shot.

      "body": "<p>Anna Climbie was failed at every turn by authorities who could have taken simple measures to prevent her murder. Now, detailed investigations are to look at what went wrong in the slow, tormented months that led to the child's death in February 1999.</p> <p>Alan Milburn, the health secretary, said yesterday that a statutory inquiry would look at every aspect of the case, including health, housing, social services, local authority and police involvement across four London boroughs.</p> <p>In the meantime, a social worker has been suspended and four other social workers and eight police officers have been served with disciplinary papers. All are being investigated over their involvement in the case. Their failings were underlined at the Old Bailey by Nigel Rumfitt, the defence QC. \"Those people exhibited a blinding degree of incompetence. If you came across a child in need, you would do more good calling the RAC than those people,\" he said.</p> <p>Yesterday, the trial judge, Richard Hawkins, said that \"lessons must be learned about failures of social services and the police inquiry following Anna's release from the North Middlesex hospital\". He added: \"I would like to be kept informed of the result of any inquiry.\"</p> <p>Mr Milburn has asked for an early report \"to determine what action should be taken to enhance the protection of vulnerable children\". All agencies will be required to cooperate and the report will be published in full. The inquiry will be by Lord Laming, a former chief inspector of social services who had been due to chair a private inquiry into Harold Shipman, the killer GP, before relatives of the victims forced a public inquiry.</p> <p>Anna's death was an appalling tragedy, Mr Milburn said. \"She was murdered by her 'carers', but was undoubtedly failed repeatedly by the child protection system. We will take all necessary steps to ensure wherever possible such failures cannothappen again.\"</p> <p>The government placed the Haringey social services department, the main child protection agency in the case, under special measures requiring close supervision by the inspectorate.</p> <p>A review undertaken when a child has died and abuse is suspected was suspended pending the trial. However, it had already concluded that \"a catalogue of errors and poor judgment led to the failure to protect this girl. Anna came to the agencies... on three separate occasions with signs and symptoms of abuse. Intervention on any one of these could have saved her life.\"</p> <p>It recommended a thorough review of the way police and social services work together, and clear and comprehensive child protection guidelines in every local authority.</p> <p>Apart from the government inquiry, the agencies that failed Anna have all launched internal investigations. Two other councils - Brent and Ealing - whose social services departments had had concerns about Anna lodged with them, will cooperate with the government inquiry.</p> <p>Yesterday, the Metropolitan police's child protection team admitted that its procedures were \"inadequate\". Its child protection teams have been restructured and eight officers are being investigated by the police complaints authority.</p> <p>Commander Carole Howlett, who has special responsibility for the teams, said she would ensure \"as far as possible that such an appalling tragedy cannot happen again\".</p> <p>Haringey's director of housing and social services, Anne Bristow, admitted that the council should have prevented the tragedy.

      "bodyText": "Anna Climbie was failed at every turn by authorities who could have taken simple measures to prevent her murder. Now, detailed investigations are to look at what went wrong in the slow, tormented months that led to the child's death in February 1999. Alan Milburn, the health secretary, said yesterday that a statutory inquiry would look at every aspect of the case, including health, housing, social services, local authority and police involvement across four London boroughs. In the meantime, a social worker has been suspended and four other social workers and eight police officers have been served with disciplinary papers. All are being investigated over their involvement in the case. Their failings were underlined at the Old Bailey by Nigel Rumfitt, the defence QC. \"Those people exhibited a blinding degree of incompetence. If you came across a child in need, you would do more good calling the RAC than those people,\" he said. Yesterday, the trial judge, Richard Hawkins, said that \"lessons must be learned about failures of social services and the police inquiry following Anna's release from the North Middlesex hospital\". He added: \"I would like to be kept informed of the result of any inquiry.\" Mr Milburn has asked for an early report \"to determine what action should be taken to enhance the protection of vulnerable children\". All agencies will be required to cooperate and the report will be published in full. The inquiry will be by Lord Laming, a former chief inspector of social services who had been due to chair a private inquiry into Harold Shipman, the killer GP, before relatives of the victims forced a public inquiry. Anna's death was an appalling tragedy, Mr Milburn said. \"She was murdered by her 'carers', but was undoubtedly failed repeatedly by the child protection system. We will take all necessary steps to ensure wherever possible such failures cannothappen again.\" The government placed the Haringey social services department, the main child protection agency in the case, under special measures requiring close supervision by the inspectorate. A review undertaken when a child has died and abuse is suspected was suspended pending the trial. However, it had already concluded that \"a catalogue of errors and poor judgment led to the failure to protect this girl. Anna came to the agencies... on three separate occasions with signs and symptoms of abuse. Intervention on any one of these could have saved her life.\" It recommended a thorough review of the way police and social services work together, and clear and comprehensive child protection guidelines in every local authority. Apart from the government inquiry, the agencies that failed Anna have all launched internal investigations. Two other councils - Brent and Ealing - whose social services departments had had concerns about Anna lodged with them, will cooperate with the government inquiry. Yesterday, the Metropolitan police's child protection team admitted that its procedures were \"inadequate\". Its child protection teams have been restructured and eight officers are being investigated by the police complaints authority. Commander Carole Howlett, who has special responsibility for the teams, said she would ensure \"as far as possible that such an appalling tragedy cannot happen again\". Haringey's director of housing and social services, Anne Bristow, admitted that the council should have prevented the tragedy. She said officers should have checked on the fact that Anna had never been to school in this country. \"Clearly visits should have been made and action taken when the allegations were made,\" she said. \"The system failed Anna - and we are part of the system.\" She said Lisa Arthurworrey, the social worker who refused to visit Manning's flat in Tottenham for fear of catching scabies, had been suspended pending the inquiry outcome. John Riordan, medical director for the North-West London hospital NHS trust, responsible for North Middlesex hospital from where Anna was discharged back to Kouao, said they would not be carrying out disciplinary procedures against their staff, but would help with Mr Milburn's inquiry as much as possible. Moira Gibb, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said it was premature to call for a fundamental overhaul of a child protec tion service that was \"probably the most sophisticated in Europe, and which many professionals from other countries envy and admire\". She acknowledged \"serious, inexcusable professional failures in this case\", but said they did not seem to stem from a lack of collaboration between agencies. \"The system we have is pretty good, but it obviously depends on the individuals working in it,\" she said. The association said the inquiry should look particularly hard at protection arrangements for vulnerable children coming from abroad. Missed chances July 15 Anna is returned from Central Middlesex hospital to Kouao because the consultant paediatrician is persuaded that her injuries - cuts, bruises and red eyes - were self-inflicted as a result of scratching because of itchiness from scabies. August 6 After two weeks in North Middlesex hospital having allegedly poured boiling water over her head Anna is returned again. She had told social worker Lisa Arthurworrey and PC Karen Jones that she caused her own injuries. November 1 Anna makes an unfounded sexual allegation against Manning, withdrawn the next day. Arthurworrey believes Kouao put the child up to it in order to get housing. The social worker's police partner on the child protection team is assigned to find out why the false allegation was made. Her letter to Kouao is ignored. No further action is taken.",

So the property developer must be tickled pink that ministers have chosen St Valentine's Day, February 14, as the date on which his Legacy consortium finally signs to buy the Millennium Dome for \u00a3125m.</p> <p>\"I went to see the structure of the dome going up... I thought, this is absolutely unbelievable, an icon building,\" said the Tory-turned-Labour donor.</p> <p>The deal will be the commercial equivalent of a householder, in this case the Cabinet Office minister Lord Falconer, exchanging contracts with the prospective buyer, Mr Bourne and the Legacy consortium. But completion has been delayed until June, leaving Lord Falconer still holding the keys to the dome on May 3, when Tony Blair is expected to go to the country.</p> <p>Perhaps it is fitting that the dome will still be in public hands, since the prime minister intended to make Greenwich's huge upturned wok the first paragraph of his manifesto, if it had lived up its billing as the greatest show on earth, rather than one of the most embarrassing episodes of the Labour government in swallowing large doses of money and failing to attract the anticipated 12m visitors.</p> <p>Yet Mr Bourne, runner-up when the dome was first up for sale and the only bidder when the Japanese bank Nomura pulled out, is happy to wait a little longer as the contents are removed and site cleared. During a break in negotiations with the solicitors representing the government, he revealed that he did not have to put the initial \u00a350m down until June, with the remaining \u00a375m due over three years in what must be one of the biggest ever interest-free hire-purchase agreements.</p> <p>He is getting the dome and 25.5 hectares (63 acres) of prime land for \u00a3125m after last year offering \u00a3150m for only 19.5 hectares. Given that \u00a3845m was pumped into the site by the public sector, he has driven a hard bargain.</p> <p>Serious doubts are growing, however, over Legacy's plans to turn what is seen as a white elephant in the public sector into the successful hi-tech Knowledge City presented in Mr Bourne's flip charts and artists' impressions.</p> <p>He himself has had to plough another \u00a32.5m of his own fortune into the project after a main backer, the construction company Sir Robert McAlpine, pulled out. This increases his Legacy stake to 15% at a personal cost of \u00a37.5m.</p> <p>Legacy was set up as a shell company by Mr Bourne in January 1999. The Irish developers Richard Barrett and John Ronan, through their controversial group Treasury Holdings, hold an 80% stake. In fiendishly complicated financing deal, the remaining 5% is held by Bank of Scotland, which is committed to lending Legacy \u00a350m in the first year of a three-year redevelopment. Eventually, the \u00a3150m total cost of refitting the dome as a \"high-technology campus\" will be turned into a 20-year loan from the bank, leaving the consortium heavily in debt.</p> <p>Lord Falconer, anxious to get Mr Bourne's signature, is playing down Legacy's failure to get Sir Robert McAlpine aboard, while Mr Bourne shrugged it off, claiming that McAlpine would take a stake \"in due course\". That company was not so certain, as a spokesman declared: \"We are interested in the construction side [of Knowledge City] but we are not a shareholder, and as far as I am concerned this has not been discussed.\"</p> <p>Mr Bourne, listed at Companies House as a director of 54 companies, boasts that he can turn in a profit by the third year when the development phase ends.</p> <p>Ministers, fearful of fresh charges that a public asset was sold on the cheap, have insisted on a 10-year profit-sharing clause. The government will share in any profit made in the first 10 years on a descending scale, taking all profit in the unlikely event of surplus in the first 12 months and then nothing from year 11.</p> <p>The \u00a3125m price tag on the dome is also conditional on certain planning permissions being granted, particularly for a housing development.</p> <p>\"By the end of year three, we want the operation in the dome to be profitable,\" said Mr Bourne. \"We deserve no less. We are a business. We're investing \u00a3150m for transforming the inside and \u00a3125m for the dome.\"</p> <p>The idea of Knowledge City is to build inside the \"wind and watertight\" dome with skylights. Space age capsules along boulevards with mature trees is the idea, renting out desks through flexible charging structures starting at, say, \u00a350 a week in buildings of 10 floors.</p> <p>Mr Bourne claims that many companies are interested in taking space, with phase one \"pretty much spoken for\" as he brandishes Legacy brochures listing universities and companies such as Sun Microsystems. Not so, said Ian Merritt, Sun's manager responsible for these negotiations. \"We do need more physical space for training and sales staff because of natural growth in the company,\" he said. \"We are in negotiation but we have not signed anything.\"</p> <p>He suggested that any future agreement would be dependent on Sun selling Legacy a lot of information technology infrastructure.</p> <p>The original plans for Knowledge City envisaged it as a business park for telecoms and dot.com-type start-ups, but as these sectors went into decline on the stock market Legacy changed its pitch towards the controversial but temporarily booming biotech sector.</p> <p>Mr Bourne, who started out in property development in the 1970s, doing up and renting clapped-out offices, talks of transforming the dome and its surrounding area into a \"vibrant\" place.</p> <p>Scores of shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants are part of his plans and so are houses, though he turns coy when pressed on details.

The four-year-old had been slowly starved and beaten by her stepfather Maurice Beckford while her mother looked on. 1984 Tyra Henry dies in local authority care. A report found that central to the case was the families being black and the social workers white. This encouraged social workers to be too trusting towards the parents. 1984 Heidi Koseda dies of starvation in Hayes, west London. Her stepfather Nicholas Price was jailed for life while her mother Rosemary Koseda was sent to a psychiatric hospital. 1986 Kimberley Carlile, four, is killed by her stepfather, Nigel Hall, who frustrated attempts by social workers and health visitors to investigate. 1987 Doreen Mason, 16 months, dies of neglect. She slept on the floor where her parents puts crisps, chips and hamburgers for her to eat. She had been tortured. 1992 Leanne White, three, is beaten to death by her stepfather who made her sleep on floorboards. Doctors found 107 marks on her body. 1993 Rikki Neave, six, is throttled with his coat zipper. A report three years later concluded that social workers failed to protect him and were \"scared\" of his drug-addict mother Ruth. 1994 Paul, 15 months, dies of neglect in a pool of urine. His grandmother had alerted social services, but no one acted. Paul's father, never named for legal reasons, was jailed for manslaughter.",

In the latest polls the the hardline Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, is maintaining a 19-point lead over Mr Barak But Mr Sharon's popularity is only part of the problem. While the poll in the newspaper Ma'ariv yesterday showed Mr Barak on 25% and Mr Sharon with 44%, it also showed the Nobel peace laureate Shimon Peres - who is not a candidate in the February 6 prime ministerial election - two points ahead of Mr Sharon. To Eli Goldschmidt, who heads Mr Barak's information campaign, it was confirmation of his greatest fear: Mr Barak, while gaining slightly on his showing last week, has failed to close the gap with Mr Sharon to an acceptable degree. Mr Peres's continued strong showing was \"disastrous\", ge said, because it increased the speculation that Mr Barak would step aside for the Mr Peres in the closing days of the campaign. Yesterday Peres supporters in the Labour party launched an internet petition in support of his candidacy; others began printing campaign badges and posters earlier this week. Party leaders said they should switch candidates if Mr Barak's team did not produce a significant gain in next week's opinion polls. \"It is very hard stimulating people to work when you have such a margin,\" Mr Goldschmidt said. \"The polls can be a self-fulfiling prediction.\" Mr Peres has particular appeal to voters on the left and among Israel's 1m Arab citizens. After months of violence in the West Bank and Gaza, and the collapse of the peace process, many on the Israeli left feel so let down by Mr Barak that they are not even going tovote, handing victory to the hawkish Mr Sharon by default. The Barak survival strategy now hinges on the television ads, which will begin on Monday, focusing on Mr Sharon's character as a politically reckless warmonger and a \"serial refusenik\" of peace deals with Egypt, Jordan, and now the Palestinians. \"We have to do some historic milestones of our opponent in Lebanon,\" Mr Goldschmidt said. \"We must show the public, because many people under the age of 35 do not know what happened there. \"For me, the slogan 'Sharon can bring peace' is like saying that there can be snow in the summer in Tel Aviv.\" . The ads are unlikely to use images of the 1,800 corpses left by the Christian militias' massacre of Palestinians in the Shatila and Sabra refugee camps in 1982 after Israel invaded Lebanon: the Barak campaign team has already been censured for a graphic newspaper ad last week. They will, however, have clips of Mr Sharon's critics, including the late Likud prime minister Menachem Begin, who accused the burly former general of lying to him. They will also show footage of Israeli tanks trundling into Lebanon in 1982 on Mr Sharon's orders, and rolling back out last May after Mr Barak ordered the army to withdraw. That was the crowning achievement of Mr Barak's 18 months as prime minister. But it is difficult to fix that foreign-policy success in the Israeli collective memory, given the upheavals of recent months. In public, at least, Mr Peres has been supportive of Mr Barak, having been promised a greater role as a peacemaker in the next government. He is expected to hold talks tonight with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, Israel Radio said, following the renewal of contacts overnight between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators. \u0095 In the West Bank town of Hebron yesterday, a 23-year-old activist in Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement hurled an explosive device and fired shots at Israeli troops. The soldiers returned fire, killing the assailant and wounding another man.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund yesterday announced a sharp cut in its forecast for US growth this year but sought to sugar the pill for jittery financial markets by ruling out a repeat of the financial contagion that swept across the globe in 1997 and 1998. Horst K\u00f6hler, the IMF's managing director, said the world's biggest economy was likely to expand 2.5% in 2001, compared with the fund's previous projection of 3.2%, but was \"on balance\" still on course for a \"soft landing\" after its recent boom. While he acknowledged that he was surprised by the pace of the reduction in American growth in recent months, Mr K\u00f6hler said it was necessary to avoid swinging from the \"exaggerated optimism of a few months ago to an exaggerated pessimism today\". Speaking in Tokyo, he said the signs still suggested that the US would avoid a recession - particularly in the wake of last week's half-point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, the US central bank. \"And, if necessary, there is quite a lot of further room for manoeuvre in both monetary and fiscal policy to maintain growth,\" Mr K\u00f6hler added. Asia would feel the impact of the slowdown in the US, he said, urging the continent to speed up the pace of its economic reforms. The IMF now expects growth in Asia - excluding Japan - to slow down to around 5% this year from about 8% in 2000 as exports to the US falter. \"I would consider such a slowdown more as a normalisation than a cause for doom and gloom, and justifying neither panic nor frantic actions,\" said Mr K\u00f6hler, who singled out solid growth in China and India as stabilising factors for Asia's economies. Fresh figures for the UK's domestic economy yesterday indicated that the strong growth in the world economy last year and the recent modest decline in the value of sterling have boosted output from factories in Britain. Data from the office for national statistics showed that manufacturing output rose 0.3% between October and November, boosted by hefty jumps in production of 1.35% in the transport industries sector and 0.6% in electrical and optical industries. Over the three months to November - considered a better guide to the underlying trend - British factories' output was up 0.2%, and was 0.7% higher than in the same period a year earlier. Despite the slightly better than expected figures for manufacturing, sterling continued to weaken to a 14-month low against the euro, with dealers suggesting that the single currency is in demand because investors believe the eurozone will outperform the UK in the face of a slowdown in the US.",

      "bodyText": "GE Capital and Aegon are expected to receive detailed financial information from Equitable Life early next week, giving them only a few days to decide whether to mount a takeover bid for the troubled mutual insurer. Their interest has revived hopes of a better deal for Equitable Life's policyholders, whose financial situation has been uncertain since last month, when Prudential pulled out of bidding for Equitable amid concerns about the size of the \"black hole\" caused by broken promises over guaranteed annuities. Amid fresh hopes of finding a way to put a ceiling on the scale of these liabilities, GE Capital and Aegon are likely to decide by the end of January whether to make an offer for Equitable Life. Both of the foreign-owned companies were rumoured to have been candidates to bid for the insurer the first time around but failed to submit concrete bids. GE Capital and Aegon both refused to comment on the speculation surrounding Equitable Life last night but were said by City sources to be the front runners among the companiesthat have expressed a new interest in the insurer. The mutual insurer is expected to send out more detailed financial information next week, assuming an agreement is reached on the scale of the liabilities. Given the fact that a month has already passed since Equitable Life closed its doors to new business, fresh bids will have to be submitted before the end of the month. The crisis at Equitable arose after a ruling made during last summer by the Law Lords that it had treated its guaranteed annuity policyholders unfairly. The insurer - which has promised to find a new chairman - yesterday named Charles Thomson from Scottish Widows as appointed actuary, the position previously held by the new chief executive, Chris Headdon. Equitable Life said last night: \"We are working all hours to get the best possible solution for policyholders\". The National Association of Pension Funds - which represents the major pension fund groups - is to put forward candidates for appointment to the board to make sure the interests of hundreds of thousands of company scheme members are fully taken into account in future. A large proportion of those who are affected by the crisis are employees of companies paying into top-up pension schemes provided by Equitable Life, and the National Association of Pension Funds said it would be putting forward one or more nominees for appointment to the board. \"Our objective in taking this action is to ensure that the interests of trustees and members of occupational pension schemes are properly taken into account as the board oversees the transition of the society from its current position to one which we hope will ensure a secure future for policyholders,\" said the organisation, which represents British pension schemes.",

      "body": "<p>Many commentators assumed that George W Bush's narrow election victory would mean a bipartisan stance on a wide range of issues, especially as power is so finely balanced in Congress.</p> <p>But no. On most issues, the Bush administration is taking a decidedly hawkish line, most obviously on defence.</p> <p>The rhetoric coming out of Washington is now that of a powerful giant beset by threats. It is a perception that is very much in line with CIA thinking in the wake of the cold war, summed up memorably by a former CIA director who said: \"We have slain the dragon but we now live in a jungle full of snakes.\"</p> <p>The Bush administration looks set to boost defence spending for the first time in 10 years, and to do so substantially and over a number of years. It is both a policy and a state of mind, and has a number of components.</p> <p>One fundamental aspect is the desire of major corporations to boost earnings. The US defence industry is dominated by a few contractors such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and TRW. All have suffered in recent years but they have immense lobbying power, close links with the Republicans and a persistent vested interest in playing up threats to US interests.</p> <p>They are helped by many in the military, where career prospects look bright once more, as well as by the numerous thinktanks and the university centres that depend on buoyant defence budgets for funding. There are powerful lobbies based on some of the defence laboratories, not least the nuclear weapons labs at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. They are already designing new weapons for \"small nuclear wars in far off places\" and looking at micro-nuclear warheads for an evolving national missile defence system (NMD).</p> <p>There are further unspoken motives, especially in relation to missile defence. Many on the Republican right believe that the only long-term threat to US dominance will come from China if it develops into an economic giant. One way to curb its growth is to force it to commit more money to defence, and NMD is one way of doing this. That may stimulate a dangerous nuclear arms race but, after all, the Soviet giant was successfully \"spent into an early grave\", so perhaps the same strategy can be applied to China.</p> <p>Beyond this there is also deep-seated opposition to any form of arms control that might limit US military capability. It may seem a strange attitude for the son of a president who negotiated several key agreements at the end of the cold war, but those were seen as providing stability without limiting US power. Now that we live in an uncertain and volatile world, there must be no such limitations.</p> <p>In many ways it is this feeling of uncertainty that lies at the heart of US security perceptions. A dominant world view coalescing around the Bush administration is that the US is the true leader of the civilised world, with a historic duty to promote the liberal market and the western way of life.</p> <p>It is almost impossible for them to comprehend that much of the rest of the world has a different view, of an increasingly divided world with a widening rich-poor gap that is already facing environmental constraints and is dominated by the power of a largely western elite. From this standpoint, the US is a major part of the problem, not the solution.</p> <p>US thinking simply cannot encompass such a mind-set - instead it sees the absolute necessity of maintaining control and keeping the lid on dissent. The symbol of the Republican party is an elephant, and the analogy is of an elephant that feels threatened to the point of paranoia by lethal mice that must be trampled on by any means available. The trouble is that an awful lot of people could get hurt in the process.</p> <p>\u0095 Paul Rogers is professor of peace studies at Bradford University</p>",

      "bodyText": "Many commentators assumed that George W Bush's narrow election victory would mean a bipartisan stance on a wide range of issues, especially as power is so finely balanced in Congress. But no. On most issues, the Bush administration is taking a decidedly hawkish line, most obviously on defence. The rhetoric coming out of Washington is now that of a powerful giant beset by threats. It is a perception that is very much in line with CIA thinking in the wake of the cold war, summed up memorably by a former CIA director who said: \"We have slain the dragon but we now live in a jungle full of snakes.\" The Bush administration looks set to boost defence spending for the first time in 10 years, and to do so substantially and over a number of years. It is both a policy and a state of mind, and has a number of components. One fundamental aspect is the desire of major corporations to boost earnings. The US defence industry is dominated by a few contractors such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and TRW. All have suffered in recent years but they have immense lobbying power, close links with the Republicans and a persistent vested interest in playing up threats to US interests. They are helped by many in the military, where career prospects look bright once more, as well as by the numerous thinktanks and the university centres that depend on buoyant defence budgets for funding. There are powerful lobbies based on some of the defence laboratories, not least the nuclear weapons labs at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. They are already designing new weapons for \"small nuclear wars in far off places\" and looking at micro-nuclear warheads for an evolving national missile defence system (NMD). There are further unspoken motives, especially in relation to missile defence. Many on the Republican right believe that the only long-term threat to US dominance will come from China if it develops into an economic giant. One way to curb its growth is to force it to commit more money to defence, and NMD is one way of doing this. That may stimulate a dangerous nuclear arms race but, after all, the Soviet giant was successfully \"spent into an early grave\", so perhaps the same strategy can be applied to China. Beyond this there is also deep-seated opposition to any form of arms control that might limit US military capability. It may seem a strange attitude for the son of a president who negotiated several key agreements at the end of the cold war, but those were seen as providing stability without limiting US power. Now that we live in an uncertain and volatile world, there must be no such limitations. In many ways it is this feeling of uncertainty that lies at the heart of US security perceptions. A dominant world view coalescing around the Bush administration is that the US is the true leader of the civilised world, with a historic duty to promote the liberal market and the western way of life. It is almost impossible for them to comprehend that much of the rest of the world has a different view, of an increasingly divided world with a widening rich-poor gap that is already facing environmental constraints and is dominated by the power of a largely western elite. From this standpoint, the US is a major part of the problem, not the solution. US thinking simply cannot encompass such a mind-set - instead it sees the absolute necessity of maintaining control and keeping the lid on dissent. The symbol of the Republican party is an elephant, and the analogy is of an elephant that feels threatened to the point of paranoia by lethal mice that must be trampled on by any means available. The trouble is that an awful lot of people could get hurt in the process. \u0095 Paul Rogers is professor of peace studies at Bradford University",

He has revamped the shops to make them \"less green and less cluttered\", sold the firm's manufacturing operation and accelerated the development of new cosmetics. However, new lines - which include Juice It body milks, Temptation make-up and a Tobacco Flower cosmetics range - are yet to take off. The changes have meant the company has been holding extra stocks, at a cost of \u00a33m, and the weak euro has cost a further \u00a33m. Analysts cut their profit forecasts from \u00a339m to \u00a328m. Mr and Mrs Roddick still hold a 25% stake in the business. The value of their shares fell by \u00a311m to \u00a347m. Laura Ashley, best known for its floral designs, failed to attract clothes shoppers over the Christmas period but showed an increase in home furnishing sales. The company, which narrowly staved off bankruptcy in 1998, reported an increase of 7% in like-for-like sales for the six week Christmas period to January 6. Home furnishings saw a 15% rise over the same period. Clothes sales were flat for the six weeks to January 6. The group, which bounced back to profit last year after poor sales and management upheavals, said it was on track for recovery, with Christmas and second half sales showing solid growth. Analysts yesterday said the figures were positive and in line with expectations. The shares edged up 0.25p to 18.25p.",

In the week before Tony Blair and his European counterparts were hogging the headlines at the Nice summit, a group of 100 economists met to discuss a crucial question which has dogged Europe since the beginning of the century - why is the upstart United States much more successful at engineering economic growth through innovative new products than Europe? One who took part, Tony Clayton of management consultants PIMS Associates, says: \"Two years ago we asked the EU policy-makers what they saw as key success factors in innovation and were surprised to find that the European Commission's Enterprise Directorate, responsible for industrial policy, didn't have anyone who understood marketing. \"And the Innovation Directorate didn't understand the role of customer communication in making innovation successful.\" Since then a series of studies to prove the economic value of marketing has led to changes in the EU and appointments in the Enterprise Directorate to deal specifically with the discipline.

What leads to business growth, says Clayton, actually runs counter to the conventional laws of economics and has little to do with costs. \"It is mostly driven by new products and service and by doing a better job for customers,\" he adds. Companies in the US have been doing this for years, which helps to explain their substantially better productivity record, and only recently have European companies shown signs of following the same strategy. \"This is relevant to the 'productivity initiative' that Gordon Brown launched,\" explains Mr Clayton. \"What is important is that we should not repeat earlier mistakes based on the 'old' analysis that says we can close the gap by piling more capital investment into businesses.

      "bodyText": "Czech MPs met in emergency session yesterday to amend the law governing public service television and end the confrontation between news staff and management, unresolved by the resignation of the man at the centre of the row, the station director Jiri Hodac. News staff took over the station three weeks ago when Mr Hodac was appointed, accusing him of political bias, and have put out their own programmes. They are refusing to end their strike until the entire management team leaves. Mr Hodac remains in post until a replacement is appointed. The strikers are supported by the biggest public protest since the communist regime was toppled in 1989. Their supporters include President Vaclav Havel, the playwright and dissident who helped bring down communism. Almost 200,000 Czechs have signed a petition protesting at Mr Hodac's appointment and each night thousands gather outside the television studios. The government is asking parliament to enlarge the television council, which appointed Mr Hodac, from nine to 14, and legislate for its members to be nominated by non-government bodies and approved by parliament: one of the journalists' key demands. It make take several weeks to enact the amendment. At present the council is appointed by political parties, and dominated by nominees of the government party, the Social Democrats (CSSD) and their coalition partners, the Civic Democrats (ODS). Mr Hodac was accused of favouring the ODS, which he denies. The council refused to accept parliament's recommendation to sack Mr Hodac. He eventually resigned on Thursday for health reasons, after being admitted to hospital. \"The amendment of the law should allow the depoliticisation of the services provided by public media,\" the culture minister, Pavel Dostal, who supported the strikers, told MPs yesterday. Mr Hodac, a former news director at the television station, is widely regarded as close to, and influenced by, the former prime minister Vaclav Klaus. The controversy has further damaged Mr Klaus, the lightning rod of the Czech political scene since the 1989 revolution, who is blamed by many for his part in the corruption and mismanagement which has soured the republic's post-communism privatisation. After his government was defeated in the 1998 general election, under strong public criticism from President Vaclav Havel, his longstanding rival, Mr Klaus and his rightwing ODS made an agreement to sustain the incoming centre-left minority Social Democrat government of Milos Zeman. But public irritation with him has increased, even in Prague, the centre of his support. The television row has been interpreted by political commentators as a rerun of last year's huge but brief and unsuccessful student-led demonstration, which was aimed at toppling the political old guard. It was followed by resounding losses for both parties in last summer's senate elections. State interference with press freedom in central and eastern Europe is not confined to the Czech Republic. In Slovakia, a change of government gave rise to a fierce struggle in the state television station, and journalists who supported the authoritarian leader Vladimir Meciar were dismissed. In neighbouring Hungary the government's critics have accused it of packing the board of directors responsible for public broadcasting.",

Costa Coffee charges \u00a31.70 for its own blend medium cappuccino and \u00a31.50 for a small one, while espresso is \u00a31.15 and a mochaccino is \u00a31.80. Chilled versions for the same drink are \u00a31.60 and \u00a31.95.</p> <p>Mrs Morgan defends the price issue, which is still headline news, by pointing out that coffee beans are only a small percentage of the cost of running a coffee shop.</p> <p>\"Customers don't complain about the price,\" she says. \"The coffee culture is very trendy now. Coffee shops offer value for time, some brain space.\"</p> <p>The coffee shop is now the \"third place\", according to Madison's operational marketing director John Tonks. \"Bars are not so family-friendly and restaurants may expect you to order food,\" he says. \"A coffee bar or lounge is the place where you can relax and enjoy yourself.\"</p> <p>Madison's charge less than most chains, with an espresso or americano at 95p, latte, cappuccino, and mocha at \u00a31.50 for a tall one and \u00a31.95 for a grande.</p> <p>Madison's has 42 outlets nationwide and recently acquired Bristol-based Cawar dine's, which was established in 1777. Cawardine's special blends will also become available in Madison's and customers will be able to buy blends to make their own coffee at home.</p> <p>Starbucks, which bought out the Seattle Coffee Company, is another big player in the market and has an wide range of drinks on offer. You can have a Gingerbread Latte at \u00a32.35 for the small size. It contains a special syrup and is topped with whipped cream. The Eggnog Latte, at the same price, is made with espresso, steamed eggnog and milk and topped with a sprinkle of nutmeg. And 10p from each drink goes to the National Literacy Trust.</p> <p>Another Christmas line starred Starbucks Christmas Blend of Latin American beans and aged Indonesian beans.</p> <p>This autumn saw another tooth-trembling drink on sale at Starbucks - the caramel macchiato - a combination of espresso, vanilla and frothy milk topped with caramel sauce costing \u00a32.35 for a medium size. Filter coffee is \u00a31.45, \u00a31.60 or \u00a31.75; caffe latte is \u00a31.75, \u00a32.15 and \u00a32.35; mocha is \u00a31.95, \u00a32.35 and \u00a32.55.</p> <p>All of these fancy drinks are based on the espresso shot, which is produced from each company's individual blends. The high pressure water system in an espresso machine brings out the coffee oils which you see as the \"crema\" on the top of the coffee. This is not something you can reproduce in your filter or cafetiere at home, says John Tonks. For that you'll need a home espresso coffee machine and then you can experiment with combination drinks of your own.</p> <p>Which? Online favours the Dualit 889 at \u00a3190, which is on sale in Selfridges and can be ordered from John Lewis. The testers said the Gaggia Espresso at \u00a3150 made reasonable coffee, the Krups Novo 2200 Plus at \u00a3110 produced good froth but did not keep the coffee hot enough, and neither did the Krups Vivo at \u00a379 which made \"disappointing\" coffee. The most expensive machine tested at \u00a3250 was the LA Pavoni EBR which made good coffee but was difficult to use.</p> <p>Cafetieres and electric filter machines come in all types and prices. Top of the range at John Lewis is a Siemens filter at \u00a3129 and the cheapest is a Morphy Richards at \u00a319.75. A chrome cafetiere making eight cups costs \u00a3 29 and for 12 cups, \u00a333.</p> <p>And then there's the coffee. These days it's an aspirational drink, says Sainsbury's coffee buyer Matt Spence.

Best-sellers are Sainsbury's own brand, then Lavazza, Taylor's of Harrogate and Douwe Egbert.</p> <p>The Original blend, a medium roast, is \u00a31.35 for 227grams; the Continental blend is \u00a31.89, Espresso \u00a31.69 and After Dinner also \u00a31.69. French coffee blended with chicory is \u00a3 1.89 and you pay the same price for a Viennese blend with fig seasoning or a straight Italian blend. In the coffees of the world range you can buy Ethiopian, Kenyan, Java, Colombian and Puerto Rico all at \u00a32.09.</p> <p>Specialist coffees are Australian Skybury, Guatemalan Antiguan and Papua New Guinea, all at \u00a3 2.19.</p> <p>As for the price issue Spence says: \"It takes a while, usually about three months, before prices hit the retail sector.

Suddenly Brits have switched on to the coffee culture and every high street now boasts at least one outlet of the ever-growing caf\u00e9 chains. And passions are also stirring over the drop in cof fee prices worldwide which have not been reflected in the cost of the cup we drink. Coffee is the second most traded commodity after oil and producers also suffer when prices fall.

He was called back a third time three months later. On this occasion it was different. Mr Marshall ushered him into the kitchen and moved the dresser, covered with breakfast cereals and marmalade, to reveal a huge vault which Tim described as containing \"a staggering array of paintings, ceramics and fine objects of vertu\". It was a veritable Aladdin's cave.</p> <p>Now, four years after the discovery, this trove is to be sold in a series of sales at Sotheby's South in Billing shurst, West Sussex on Monday January 29 to Thursday February 1, 2001.</p> <p>Joe Marshall, who died last year aged 91, was born in Blackburn. He was the son of Mrs E J Marshall, who built up the family antiques business and joined when he was 14. Apart from a stint in Preston during the Second World War Joe lived in Blackburn all his life and was passionate about antiques. For 25 years he was one of the largest dealers of pottery and porcelain in the north-west and was especially fond of paintings and Royal Worcester porcelain.</p> <p>Tim Wonnacott points out that Joe Marshall and the Austins were in a very strong position to build up collections. He says: \"During the industrial revolution the Victorian middle classes bought paintings and antiques for their homes. When the north-west went into decline from the 1930s onwards, families would sell off pieces perhaps to pay bills, or solicitors would call in dealers to clear houses on deaths.

The collection is light on furniture, although there is a good French late 19th century mahogany and parquetry gilt mounted vitrine by Henry Dasson, a Parisian known for high quality work. This piece is estimated at \u00a35,000 to \u00a38,000.</p> <p>There are more than are 100 lots of ceramics and glass.

The pair is estimated at \u00a35,000 to \u00a37,000. So too is a Royal Worcester reticulated vase and cover, dating from 1907, by George Owen. These vases, very fine, have become rare.</p> <p>There are good examples of glass. A cameo glass scent bottle by Thomas Webb, modelled as a swan, dates from 1884 and is expected fetch \u00a31,500 to \u00a32,000. In the objects of vertu section one of the most appealing pieces is a 20th century gold Freedom box engraved with the arms of the City of Cork, estimated to fetch \u00a38,000 to \u00a312,000.

      "body": "<p>Are mobile phones the new cigarettes? Each crosses the boundaries of class, gender, age and nationality. Each has generated a great deal of revenue for governments: cigarettes through high sales taxes, mobile phones through the granting of licences and sales taxes. Each costs most users more money than they want to pay. Each has tremendous potential to annoy those who don't use them.</p> <p>Whether they have a more important similarity - that they are capable of killing their users - is going to be the subject of an American lawsuit announced at the very end of last year.</p> <p>Peter Angelos, a Baltimore attorney famous for winning $4.2bn (\u00a32.8bn) for lung cancer sufferers from the tobacco industry, will in March commence the first in a series of test cases in California, against Vodafone. The actions will be brought on behalf of frequent mobile users who have suffered brain tumours and the main issue will be whether a link between mobile use and the condition can be established.</p> <p>Much will depend upon the views of the experts each side will line up. Doctors, statisticians, physicists and engineers will all have a role to play. So far, the mobile phone industry has fought off all claims against it made on this basis. The fact that Mr Angelos has now put his reputation and his firm's tremendous resources behind the claims adds greatly to the credibility of the arguments.</p> <p>The case will cost tens of millions of dollars to present and he will only be paid if he wins. Theoretically, findings in American courts have no force in Britain. On a strictly legalistic analysis it could be said that a decision made in any case brought by an individual has no bearing on anyone else's case. The law involved in deciding the issue is not complicated and will not set any formal precedent.</p> <p>In practice, though, once a respected court, having heard detailed scientific evidence, decided there was a link the impact would be enormous. Thousands of \"passive smoking\" cases were settled after Australian litigation in the late 80s led to a finding such smoking could lead to lung cancer.</p> <p>The industry may have done itself no favours by its failure to recognise the risks.

      "bodyText": "Are mobile phones the new cigarettes? Each crosses the boundaries of class, gender, age and nationality. Each has generated a great deal of revenue for governments: cigarettes through high sales taxes, mobile phones through the granting of licences and sales taxes. Each costs most users more money than they want to pay. Each has tremendous potential to annoy those who don't use them. Whether they have a more important similarity - that they are capable of killing their users - is going to be the subject of an American lawsuit announced at the very end of last year. Peter Angelos, a Baltimore attorney famous for winning $4.2bn (\u00a32.8bn) for lung cancer sufferers from the tobacco industry, will in March commence the first in a series of test cases in California, against Vodafone. The actions will be brought on behalf of frequent mobile users who have suffered brain tumours and the main issue will be whether a link between mobile use and the condition can be established. Much will depend upon the views of the experts each side will line up. Doctors, statisticians, physicists and engineers will all have a role to play. So far, the mobile phone industry has fought off all claims against it made on this basis. The fact that Mr Angelos has now put his reputation and his firm's tremendous resources behind the claims adds greatly to the credibility of the arguments. The case will cost tens of millions of dollars to present and he will only be paid if he wins. Theoretically, findings in American courts have no force in Britain. On a strictly legalistic analysis it could be said that a decision made in any case brought by an individual has no bearing on anyone else's case. The law involved in deciding the issue is not complicated and will not set any formal precedent. In practice, though, once a respected court, having heard detailed scientific evidence, decided there was a link the impact would be enormous. Thousands of \"passive smoking\" cases were settled after Australian litigation in the late 80s led to a finding such smoking could lead to lung cancer. The industry may have done itself no favours by its failure to recognise the risks. In 1999 Orange published an article in its customer magazine asking whether media speculation on the association between mobile phone use and \"headaches, dizziness and even cancers\" was \"fact or fiction\". It concluded it was fiction. But no one knows for sure yet. In 10 years' time, if, say, brain tumours are twice as frequent among mobile phone users as among the general population, the consequences for the industry, facing tens of thousands of substantial claims, will be dire. The tobacco industry was extraordinarily stubborn in its refusal to recognise that cigarettes cause lung cancer. Well into the 80s it was denying that a link had been proved. It was this position that contributed to the willingness of American courts to award massive exemplary damages against cigarette manufacturers: their deliber ate deception of the public was punished as much as its selling of a lethal product. There may not yet be enough evidence to persuade many mobile users to give up their phones. If a link is proved, the companies with the best prospects of surviving are those which have warned users of possible risks, not those who have dismissed them.

In my antepenultimate On The Rack column, I gave Mr Clutten's name as Chutten, while writing on the German retailer (now a phenomenon within these shores) Aldi. </p> <p>Aldi is a cash-and-carry warehouse operation whose 'no-frills' policy prices as low as any. Over Christmas, for example, its house champagne, Prince Laurent Brut (a product of one of France's largest wine companies), was reduced from \u00a39.99 to \u00a37.89. Even so, I could rate it only 11 points out of 20, for it did little to charm my tastebuds and was really only acceptable as a base for a kir royal (or some such cocktail). However, why spend even \u00a37.89 when you can buy cava for half this and achieve exactly the same result? </p> <p>The rest of Aldi's range made more or less the same impression, I am sorry to say. St Jean Colombard &amp; Ugni Blanc (\u00a32.09) rates 12 points, Liebfraumilch Nahe 1999 (\u00a31.89) rates eight, Riesling Hock (\u00a32.49) rates 12.5 (good base for a summer spritzer, here), Niersteiner Gutes Domtal Sp\u00e4tlese 1998 (\u00a32.49) rates 11 points, Frascati Superiore 1999 (\u00a32.99) notches up 11 points also, Chardonnay Budavar 1999, from Hungary, (\u00a32.49) manages 12.5 points, and Reflets de Bourgogne Chardonnay 1999 (\u00a34.49) struggles to reach 10 points. The only two whites to make 14 points were the Australian Semillon Chardonnay 1999 (\u00a32.99), with its agreeable hints of ripe melon, pear and lemon, and the California Mountain Vineyards Chardonnay 1999 (\u00a33.99), which has some creamy richness to the soft woodiness that gives it some class. </p> <p>On the red side, the non-vintage Le Rouge France (\u00a31.89) was the cheapest wine I tasted last year, and also the least impactful. There was nothing to loathe except its vacuousness. It rates 10 points. Baron St Jean Vin de Pays de Gard (\u00a32.09) rates 10.5 points, Ch\u00e2teau Selection Claret Bordeaux 1999 (\u00a32.49) rates 11 points, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo 1999 (\u00a32.99) achieves the same, as does Budavar Merlot 1999 (\u00a32.49). Fleurie Le Challier 1999 (\u00a34.49) rates 12 points, Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon NV (\u00a32.99) rates 11.5 points, but takes the prize as the most spineless Chilean red I've tasted. Australian Shiraz Cabernet Sauvignon 1999 (\u00a32.99) makes nine points and the Californian Mountain Vineyards Zinfandel Shiraz 1999 (\u00a33.99) 10.5 points. The one red I could enthuse about was Vieux Ch\u00e2teau Saint-Pierre Montagne St-Emilion 1998 (14 points, \u00a34.49), which is an eminently quaffable authentic merlot (with a layering of cabernet franc). There is a nice touch of liquorice to the blackcurrants. Last at Aldi, there is Moscato Spumante from Italy, a sweet \u00a32.99 bubble that rates 10 points. </p> <p>Aldi needs to add flair to its rock-bottom prices, in much the same way as Somerfield has done. Wine prices there are also risibly low, but the quality is deliciously high. South African Colombard Chardonnay 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.99 - although at Kwik Save it is apparently for sale at \u00a33.49) is outstandingly well textured and classy. Bright Brothers Uruguayan Sauvignon/Semillon 2000 (15.5 points, \u00a33.99) is immensely quaffable, with crisp yet softly undertoned fruit, and refreshing to finish. South African Chenin Blanc 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.99) offers a superb texture and fascinating gooseberry/melon fruit. Non- vintage Merlot Vin de Pays l'Ardeche (15 points, \u00a33.35 - \u00a32.99 at Kwik Save) is fresh and cherry-fruited. Non-vintage Argentine Red (15 points, \u00a32.99) has spicy plums allied to organised tannins, and is a great quaffing experience for the money. </p> <p>Sainsbury's offers us a splendid pair of 16.5-point reds at \u00a34.99. Concha y Toro Casillero del Diablo Cabernet Sauvignon 1999, from Chile, develops on the tastebuds from ripe cherries to smoky blackcurrants, with a hint of spice, and a suggestion of gravy. This is a lovely, textured cabernet of great class. Louis Bernard Ctes du Rhne Villages 1999 parades herbs, pleasant earthiness and deep plum fruit.

      "body": "<p>In 1328, the splendidly named Guild Of Pepperers was registered as \"Grossarii\", from which the term grocer is derived. Not enough people know that. The fact that a spice should have its own guild is an indication of just how important pepper was considered to be in the great scheme of English cooking. And things haven't changed that much. Pepper may be the most common of all the spices, but its worth in cooking is incalculable, and no other spice figures as frequently.</p> <p>The climbing tree, Piper nigrum , which winds its way up the trunks of mango or betel trees, bears but one fruit, a berry, that is harvested at different stages of ripeness - fully under-ripened to give the green peppercorn; slightly under-ripened to produce the black peppercorn; and fully ripened to give the greatly prized white peppercorns.</p> <p>Green peppercorns can be dried, but are more generally used in their brined form, with a soft texture that is easy to crush and quite delicious. To produce black peppercorns, the berries are picked when they begin to turn red, and then piled high and allowed to ferment for several days before being spread out on mats to dry, when they turn black. The ripest berries produce white pepper; after harvesting, they are soaked to soften the pericarp, or outer wall, allowing the removal of the seed within.</p> <p>The tree was native to, most famously, the forests of Malabar. In his book Dangerous Tastes, Andrew Dalby writes of the Greeks' use of Malabar pepper in the 4th century BC and how the Romans, 500 years later, took advantage of the predictable monsoon winds to sail to the ports of south-west India. Cultivation of the tree began in earnest, although the Roman obsession for pepper was not to everyone's taste: a Tamil poet wryly commented on Roman ships arriving with silver and gold and leaving with pepper, and Dalby quotes Pliny bemoaning 100 million sestertia a year being spent on pepper to satisfy Rome's lusty appetite.</p> <p>As the European passion for spices grew, the lengths to which the Portuguese, Dutch and English went to try to achieve the spice monopolies were truly extraordinary, their methods highly questionable, often downright vicious and most treacherous.</p> <p>In spite of the huge mercantile interest and adventure it has inspired in the past, it's not often that pepper gets to be the hero in any dish. But there is no doubt that the foods we eat today would often be lacking without it. There is hardly a dish in which it doesn't add its distinctive heat.</p> <p>Whether to use white or black pepper is a minor debate. White is milder than black, but less aromatic. You can combine equal quantities of white and black peppercorns, then crack them to make migonette pepper, which is a happy vehicle, splendidly flavouring meat and forming a glorious crust while frying gently.</p> <p>Unground peppercorns will keep indefinitely, and the cunning device that is the efficient pepper mill is an indispensable tool in a kitchen. Once ground, the glory of pepper fades. The rubbish that is sold as ground pepper should be banished, as it is generally made from poor-quality pepper and has little worth. While the tree is now grown throughout the tropics, those of India - Alleppey, Tellicherry and Mangalore - are still among the the most highly prized and are worth seeking out.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Hot and sour soup</b></p> <p>This recipe may seem lengthy, but that's only because it has a lot of ingredients - and that means a visit to the nearest Chinese supermarket.</p> <p><b> 2 large dried mushrooms </b><br> <b>6 tree ear mushrooms </b><br> <b>4 dried tiger lily stems </b><br> <b>1 tbsp peanut oil </b><br> <b>50g pork, finely shredded </b><br> <b>1 tbsp light soy sauce </b><br> <b>1 big handful bamboo shoots, finely shredded </b><br> <b>1.2 litres chicken stock </b><br> <b>Salt </b><br> <b>3 tbsp very good red-wine vinegar </b><br> <b>1 tsp dark soy sauce </b><br> <b>1 slabs fresh white bean curd </b><br> <b>2 eggs, lightly beaten </b><br> <b>1 tbsp sesame oil </b><br> <b>1 tsp freshly-milled black pepper </b><br> <b>8 spring onions </b><br> <b>1 big handful fresh coriander, washed and picked</b></p> <p>Put the mushrooms, tree ears and tiger lily stems in a mixing bowl, and steep in boiling water. After half an hour, lift out the softened pieces and drain. Cut away the stems of the mushrooms and the harder part of the tree ears. Chop the mushrooms and tree ears into very thin slices. If the tiger lily is very long, shred it with your fingers.</p> <p>The soup can be cooked in a heavy-based pan, but a wok is better. Place it over a high heat, pour in the peanut oil and fry the pork, stirring and separating the strips. Add the light soy sauce, then the mushrooms, tree ears, tiger lily stems and bamboo shoots. Stir for a minute, then add the stock, a little salt, the vinegar and the dark soy sauce. Bring to the boil.</p> <p>Finely slice the bean curd. Trim and finely slice the spring onion. Chop the coriander. Drop the curd strips into the broth, return it to the boil, then turn off the heat for 30 seconds. Tip in the sesame oil and pepper, stir, then pour in the beaten egg in a steady stream. Add the spring onion and coriander. Stir again, and serve at once.</p> <p><b> Salt and pepper squid </b><br></p> <p><b> 800g squid </b><br> <b>1 tbsp plain flour </b><br> <b>1 tsp sea salt </b><br> <b>1 tsp freshly-ground black pepper </b><br> <b>Vegetable oil, for deep frying</b></p> <p>To garnish</p> <p><b> 2 green chillies </b><br> <b>8 spring onions </b><br> <b>Lemon wedges</b></p> <p>Clean and prepare the squid (ie, remove the ink sac and backbone, and clean out the inside of the squid tube), discarding the sideflaps but keeping the tentacles. If the squids are large, cut the flesh into squares; if they're small, cut the body into rounds. Rinse, then pat dry.</p> <p>Heat the oil, in a deep-fat fryer if you have one, and have a wide dish piled high with kitchen paper to hand. Wash and trim the onions and chillies, then slice both as thinly as possible. Mix together the flour, salt and pepper, pop the dried squid in a bowl and toss in the seasoned flour, coating all the squid pieces. Adjust the seasoning to taste.</p> <p>Drop a handful of the squid at a time into the oil, and fry for a minute. Tip the cooked squid on to the kitchen paper, and repeat until all the squid is cooked. Pile it on a plate, scatter over the slivers of chilli and spring onion, and serve with lemon wedges.</p> <p><b> Fricassee of chicken with green peppers and tarragon</b></p> <p>I've suggested two chickens here, as the leftovers make an excellent salad.</p> <p><b> 2 free-range, organic chickens </b><br> <b>Olive oil </b><br> <b>Salt and black pepper </b><br> <b>8 cloves garlic, peeled </b><br> <b>150ml white wine </b><br> <b>2 tbsp Armagnac </b><br> <b>2 tbsp jarred green peppercorns, plus 1 tsp pepper juice </b><br> <b>1 tbsp fresh tarragon, picked </b><br> <b>1 tsp Dijon mustard </b><br> <b>200ml whipping cream </b><br> <b> lemon, juiced</b></p> <p>Cut the legs from the chickens, ensuring that the oyster-shaped pieces of dark meat do not remain on the carcass. Remove the backbone, and use this, the leg and wing tips and other bits to make a simple stock. Cut each breast piece into four, then separate the drumsticks and the thighs. Set a large, heavy-bottomed pan over a medium heat. Pour in a little oil, liberally salt and pepper the pieces of chicken, and lay the meat, skin-side down, in the pan and leave to fry gently, undisturbed, along with the cloves of garlic. Cook for 20 minutes until golden, then turn each piece.

      "bodyText": "In 1328, the splendidly named Guild Of Pepperers was registered as \"Grossarii\", from which the term grocer is derived. Not enough people know that. The fact that a spice should have its own guild is an indication of just how important pepper was considered to be in the great scheme of English cooking. And things haven't changed that much. Pepper may be the most common of all the spices, but its worth in cooking is incalculable, and no other spice figures as frequently. The climbing tree, Piper nigrum , which winds its way up the trunks of mango or betel trees, bears but one fruit, a berry, that is harvested at different stages of ripeness - fully under-ripened to give the green peppercorn; slightly under-ripened to produce the black peppercorn; and fully ripened to give the greatly prized white peppercorns. Green peppercorns can be dried, but are more generally used in their brined form, with a soft texture that is easy to crush and quite delicious. To produce black peppercorns, the berries are picked when they begin to turn red, and then piled high and allowed to ferment for several days before being spread out on mats to dry, when they turn black. The ripest berries produce white pepper; after harvesting, they are soaked to soften the pericarp, or outer wall, allowing the removal of the seed within. The tree was native to, most famously, the forests of Malabar. In his book Dangerous Tastes, Andrew Dalby writes of the Greeks' use of Malabar pepper in the 4th century BC and how the Romans, 500 years later, took advantage of the predictable monsoon winds to sail to the ports of south-west India. Cultivation of the tree began in earnest, although the Roman obsession for pepper was not to everyone's taste: a Tamil poet wryly commented on Roman ships arriving with silver and gold and leaving with pepper, and Dalby quotes Pliny bemoaning 100 million sestertia a year being spent on pepper to satisfy Rome's lusty appetite. As the European passion for spices grew, the lengths to which the Portuguese, Dutch and English went to try to achieve the spice monopolies were truly extraordinary, their methods highly questionable, often downright vicious and most treacherous. In spite of the huge mercantile interest and adventure it has inspired in the past, it's not often that pepper gets to be the hero in any dish. But there is no doubt that the foods we eat today would often be lacking without it. There is hardly a dish in which it doesn't add its distinctive heat. Whether to use white or black pepper is a minor debate. White is milder than black, but less aromatic. You can combine equal quantities of white and black peppercorns, then crack them to make migonette pepper, which is a happy vehicle, splendidly flavouring meat and forming a glorious crust while frying gently. Unground peppercorns will keep indefinitely, and the cunning device that is the efficient pepper mill is an indispensable tool in a kitchen. Once ground, the glory of pepper fades. The rubbish that is sold as ground pepper should be banished, as it is generally made from poor-quality pepper and has little worth. While the tree is now grown throughout the tropics, those of India - Alleppey, Tellicherry and Mangalore - are still among the the most highly prized and are worth seeking out. All recipes serve six. Hot and sour soup This recipe may seem lengthy, but that's only because it has a lot of ingredients - and that means a visit to the nearest Chinese supermarket. 2 large dried mushrooms 6 tree ear mushrooms 4 dried tiger lily stems 1 tbsp peanut oil 50g pork, finely shredded 1 tbsp light soy sauce 1 big handful bamboo shoots, finely shredded 1.2 litres chicken stock Salt 3 tbsp very good red-wine vinegar 1 tsp dark soy sauce 1 slabs fresh white bean curd 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1 tbsp sesame oil 1 tsp freshly-milled black pepper 8 spring onions 1 big handful fresh coriander, washed and picked Put the mushrooms, tree ears and tiger lily stems in a mixing bowl, and steep in boiling water. After half an hour, lift out the softened pieces and drain. Cut away the stems of the mushrooms and the harder part of the tree ears. Chop the mushrooms and tree ears into very thin slices. If the tiger lily is very long, shred it with your fingers. The soup can be cooked in a heavy-based pan, but a wok is better. Place it over a high heat, pour in the peanut oil and fry the pork, stirring and separating the strips. Add the light soy sauce, then the mushrooms, tree ears, tiger lily stems and bamboo shoots. Stir for a minute, then add the stock, a little salt, the vinegar and the dark soy sauce. Bring to the boil. Finely slice the bean curd. Trim and finely slice the spring onion. Chop the coriander. Drop the curd strips into the broth, return it to the boil, then turn off the heat for 30 seconds. Tip in the sesame oil and pepper, stir, then pour in the beaten egg in a steady stream. Add the spring onion and coriander. Stir again, and serve at once. Salt and pepper squid 800g squid 1 tbsp plain flour 1 tsp sea salt 1 tsp freshly-ground black pepper Vegetable oil, for deep frying To garnish 2 green chillies 8 spring onions Lemon wedges Clean and prepare the squid (ie, remove the ink sac and backbone, and clean out the inside of the squid tube), discarding the sideflaps but keeping the tentacles. If the squids are large, cut the flesh into squares; if they're small, cut the body into rounds. Rinse, then pat dry. Heat the oil, in a deep-fat fryer if you have one, and have a wide dish piled high with kitchen paper to hand. Wash and trim the onions and chillies, then slice both as thinly as possible. Mix together the flour, salt and pepper, pop the dried squid in a bowl and toss in the seasoned flour, coating all the squid pieces. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Drop a handful of the squid at a time into the oil, and fry for a minute. Tip the cooked squid on to the kitchen paper, and repeat until all the squid is cooked. Pile it on a plate, scatter over the slivers of chilli and spring onion, and serve with lemon wedges. Fricassee of chicken with green peppers and tarragon I've suggested two chickens here, as the leftovers make an excellent salad. 2 free-range, organic chickens Olive oil Salt and black pepper 8 cloves garlic, peeled 150ml white wine 2 tbsp Armagnac 2 tbsp jarred green peppercorns, plus 1 tsp pepper juice 1 tbsp fresh tarragon, picked 1 tsp Dijon mustard 200ml whipping cream lemon, juiced Cut the legs from the chickens, ensuring that the oyster-shaped pieces of dark meat do not remain on the carcass. Remove the backbone, and use this, the leg and wing tips and other bits to make a simple stock. Cut each breast piece into four, then separate the drumsticks and the thighs. Set a large, heavy-bottomed pan over a medium heat. Pour in a little oil, liberally salt and pepper the pieces of chicken, and lay the meat, skin-side down, in the pan and leave to fry gently, undisturbed, along with the cloves of garlic. Cook for 20 minutes until golden, then turn each piece. Cook for a further five to 10 minutes, then remove the breast pieces and keep warm while the legs continue cooking through. Once done, place all the meat in a dish and keep warm. Raise the heat under the pan, pour in the Armagnac and then the white wine, and as they bubble away, scrape up any bits and pieces of chicken that have stuck to the bottom of the pan. Simmer until the liquid has reduced by one third, then stir in the peppercorns and their juice and whisk in the mustard. Bring the sauce to a boil and tip in the cream. Chop the tarragon and add this to the pan, along with the lemon juice. Stir, simmer for a minute, then pour over the chicken and serve piping hot. Sauce poivrade This goes well with meats, game and robust fish such as hake or monkfish. For the stock 1kg free-range, organic chicken pieces, on the bone 1 carrot 3 onions 1 stick celery 1 leek 1 bayleaf 1 small sprig fresh thyme 6 black peppercorns 100ml white wine 2 pig's trotters For the sauce 2 onions, chopped 1 small carrot, chopped 1 small stick celery, chopped 1 clove garlic, chopped 5 parsley stalks 1 bayleaf 30ml top-quality red-wine vinegar 1 litre chicken stock 200ml good red wine 15 black peppercorns 30g unsalted butter First, make the stock. In a heavy-bottomed pan, fry the chicken in a little vegetable oil until golden. Wash and chop the veg, and fry them in the same pot until they, too, take on some colour. Pour in the wine, and add the herbs and pepper. Add the trotters, pour in enough cold water to cover the chicken by a good 5cm, then bring to a simmer and cook for 1 &lt;+&gt;1 / &lt;-&gt;2 -2 hours.

      "body": "<p>The young man dressed in black appears to be speaking to his wristwatch. Except it's not a watch. It's some kind of minuscule walkie-talkie strapped to his wrist, in the style of a baddy in Mission: Impossible, say, or The Matrix. \"Location required for two medium-sized pieces of luggage,\" he says to his wrist. There's a pause, then the response comes back. Affirmative - location found. Over and out. The young man is a bellhop at New York's Hudson hotel, and we've asked him if he can store our bags for a couple of hours until we leave to catch our flight home. </p> <p>A bit of a palaver, the stunt with the walkie-talkie - a bit of a performance. But that's the whole point of the Hudson. For Ian Schrager's modish hotels, of which the Hudson is the newest and biggest, are all about performance. The exteriors are unobtrusive, but inside they are designed (by Philippe Starck) like whimsical stage sets, full of skewed proportions and vertiginous angles. The entrance to the Royalton, also in New York, is essentially a catwalk - a raised platform that runs through the bar - an exhibitionist's dream, along which you must walk, or sashay. At the Hudson, a glass-enclosed escalator in a vivid shaft of yellow light transports you up to the 40ft-high, glass-roofed lobby. They, the hotels, are also about atmosphere. \"It makes you want to drink,\" said a teetotal New Yorker friend as he emerged from the futuristic, translucent Hudson bar, where the glass floor literally lights up. </p> <p>Since its opening, people have been queueing along the street at weekends just to have a drink here. Yet, such is the ingenious sleight of hand that Schrager pulls off, the appeal of his hotels is their exclusivity, or rather the illusion of exclusivity. An eager young Englishman in the Hudson's \"library\" bar informed us that the previous evening Harrison Ford had been sitting in the very same capacious leather armchair that I was now occupying. Jack Nicholson loves the macaroni cheese, someone else told us in the restaurant. Well, if it's good enough for Jack... The highly profitable Schrager formula - last year, the business is said to have made a $120m profit - is predicated on the whiff of glamour and celebrity that pervades his establishments. Maybe a little of that lustre, that sex appeal will rub off on the rest of us. Ker-ching! </p> <p>The 54-year-old Schrager, inventor of the \"boutique hotel\" or \"destination hotel\", is largely responsible for a sea change in the hotel industry (although, with 900 rooms, the Hudson makes a rather large boutique). You only have to flick through glossy magazines such as Wallpaper* or Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller, or books such as the best-selling Hip Hotels series, to see that the Schrager game plan extends far beyond his own domain. In modern city travel there is a decisive move away from the sameness summed up by the old Holiday Inn slogan \"the best surprise is no surprise\". </p> <p>It was a trend that Schrager kickstarted in 1984 with his first hotel, Morgans, and followed up with the Royalton and Paramount, all in New York. The art of lobby culture was born, or reborn, and these hotels became hot spots for locals and guests alike. Miami's Delano (where Madonna co-owns the restaurant) followed, and the Mondrian in West Hollywood. Schrager has opened in London, too, with St Martins Lane and the Sanderson (with holographic lifts and a stained-glass-windowed billiards room) equally beloved by the jet set and would-be jet set. </p> <p>If anyone should know about celebrity and glamour - and their sleazy downside - it's Schrager, the man who created the legendary 70s New York nightclub, Studio 54 (and later, in the 80s, Palladium, one of the biggest clubs New York has ever seen). Studio 54 was the mecca of the disco generation, where Bianca Jagger famously once made a grand entrance on a white horse. It is remembered as a hedonistic hang-out, where Warhol sat and watched as Mick, Margaux, Liza and Truman Capote caroused, along with the hosts of extravagantly dressed decadents, druggies and party people who also managed to gain entry. Two films, The Last Days Of Disco and 54, have re-told the story of the club's rise and ultimate fall - a dramatic raid, and the arrest and imprisonment of its owners, Schrager and Steve Rubell, for tax evasion in 1980. </p> <p>Nightclub entrepreneur was not a career that was mapped out for Schrager, he says, nor even hotelier, when he was growing up in Brooklyn's East Flatbush. His parents brought him up with \"middle class, maybe somewhat provincial, values\" (rumours of his father's alleged mob connections have always been flatly denied by Schrager). \"The entertainment business would have been taboo to them.\" In any case, as it turned out, his parents would never know of their son's career path - Schrager senior died when his son was just 19, and Ian lost his mother five years after that. By then he had trained at Syracuse University to become an attorney, and it was there that he met fellow Brooklynite Steve Rubell. Schrager practised law for a while, but then the pair \"fell into\" the nightclub business, \"you didn't need much capital\". </p> <p>They were a winning team - Rubell was flamboyant and gay, Schrager reserved and straight. Their friendship and business partnership lasted until Rubell's death of an Aids-related illness in 1989. \"I'll never have the kind of friendship I had with Steve, who I loved,\" says Schrager. \"We went to school together and grew up together and had our ups and downs together, and it was a really, y'know, unique and special thing.\" Nightclubs suited his fancy, he says, encompassing as they did many disciplines in an undisciplined, \"freewheeling\" way. Schrager always had the more detached approach of the two - Rubell was the front man, working the door and mingling flamboyantly, Schrager tended to stay put in the office at the back of the club, earning the nickname \"Greta\", after Garbo. </p> <p>Schrager famously never danced at Studio 54. But it is now widely considered to be his intuitive understanding of detail, of creating an ambience, that was the driving force behind the duo's success. But it was never an intellectual exercise, he insists. \"All you have is the atmosphere you create, it's about creating this magic and this excitement and this cachet because you really don't have anything else distinguishable from other nightclubs.\" </p> <p> Studio 54 was the paradigm for Schrager's subsequent ventures, but also for much of late 20th-century, urban nightlife. The media frenzy, the celeb clientele, the smart design - all of these became commonplace in urban bars and clubs in the decades that followed. And it was here that the \"velvet rope\" approach to nightclub access was pioneered - the rope was the barrier between the in-crowd, handpicked by Rubell from the throng who assembled nightly on the pavement outside, and the forlorn rejects. Schrager has always dismissed accusations of elitism. \"I used to say it's the most democratic club of them all, because it has nothing to do with wealth or race or religion or creed. It does have to do with a spirit, an attitude.\" He says he used to see \"people in ballgowns dancing with people in jeans\", and that is a sensibility that has stayed with him. </p> <p>The hedonistic mood, too, has since become legendary. It was a different time, \"much druggier, not as cerebral or social as now - the time for that kind of thing has come and gone\". The wildness can be overplayed, he says: \"It wasn't debauchery, as legend has it, it wasn't that bad.\" Schrager had grown up in New York in the 60s when, he says, it was the black population who had set the cultural agenda. \"In the 70s, it was the gay population's time to emerge and set the cultural tone.\" It was also a time when the Pill and the liberation that came with it had begun to take off. \"All of this was hitting its stride,\" he says. In the States, the 70s were known as the \"me decade\" (a label more usually attributed to the 80s here), and nothing encapsulated that sensibility more than Studio 54. \"Everyone was really self-involved, and that self-involvement necessarily led to a lot of indulgence.\" </p> <p>Now, the mood of celebratory sexual permissiveness that Studio 54 was known for seems outdated, a sensibility defined by, and contained within, its era.\"My memories are really ones of spontaneity and innocence and naivety,\" says Schrager. \"It was pre-Aids, pre all of the things that we've subsequently learned about the price we pay, and about the things that aren't good for you or aren't appropriate or aren't right. It was like, anything goes. But I don't look on it as Sodom and Gomorrah. No, I look on it as, y'know, the Baby Boomers having a real impact on culture and flexing their muscles and experimenting.\" </p> <p>But it couldn't last. The club was raided by Internal Revenue Service agents in 1979. They found nearly $1m stashed in bin bags concealed in the ceiling of the office, and it was estimated that another $2.5m had been skimmed. How did they think they could get away with it? Did their success and the mood of the time make them feel invincible? \"Invincible - I'm not sure. Intoxicated with the whole thing, yes. It was like a lightning bolt, like holding on to a lightning bolt.\" </p> <p>The club closed in 1980, and Schrager and Rubell were sentenced to three years in jail. They served one year at the Maxwell Federal Prison Camp in Montgomery, Alabama. It was a reflective time for Schrager, and a \"completely humbling\" one. But it didn't quash the pair's enthusiasm or passion, and it was during their time inside that they decided to go into the hotel business. His father used to say, it's okay to make a mistake, but it's not okay if you don't pick yourself up afterwards and start over again. </p> <p>He thinks it would have killed his parents to have seen their son sent to jail, but he hopes that they would be proud if they could see him now. He has friends whose parents are starting to die now. \"I say to them, 'Well, at least they got to see you successful, and got to see your kids and see the fruits of their labours.' My parents were deprived of that.\" </p> <p>Schrager bounced back with notable resilience. Many of the team working for ISH (Ian Schrager Hotels, now a very large business concern) have known him since the Studio 54 days. Along with Starck, there is Anda Andreiou, a Romanian-born architect who has worked with Schrager since his first hotel and now oversees a team of architects. She says that her boss is not always easy, \"But I don't think anything really good came out of easy. His best quality is how much he can push us all when it comes to design. You end up giving 110%, when you never even knew you had it in you.\" </p> <p>The philosophy - according to Schrager - is egalitarian: he is a populist. He never relies on a traditional formula of luxury. \"The trimmings of wealth are not as important to me and my generation as they were to my parents' generation. Status based on wealth is an old-fashioned idea, I find it repugnant, actually.\" It's true that his hotels, notably the Hudson and the Paramount, are comparatively affordable ($95 for a single room; from $175 for a standard) - though the more inexpensive rooms are modestly sized. </p> <p> Historically, grand hotels conferred a social status on their guests that was to do with wealth and class; the cachet that Schrager confers is something else. The same principle that applied in the Studio 54 era applies now. It's the status of \"I'm in the know,\" he says, \"not, 'I'm in the money.' Great ideas have no attachment to either money or class.\" The tendency of many people to desire access to the supposedly inaccessible is as prevalent now as it was in Studio 54's heyday - probably more so. And he is as shrewd as he ever was at exploiting that. The notion that only those with a certain imponderable \"sensibility\" check in to a Schrager hotel makes guests feel like they are gaining access to some kind of exclusive club. </p> <p>His hotels do not suit everyone, of course. Some find the rooms claustrophobic, the ambience precious or pretentious. Some find them intimidating, suitable only for fashion victims. \"If they do intimidate, then we fail, that's not our goal. We never want to do something that only the critics like, or that only a few select groups like,\" he says. \"But also,\" he adds, \"they're not for everyone, our hotels, and that's their strength.\" He defends their design, too. \"They can't be pigeon-holed, they're not minimalist or trendy, they're the opposite of that. We have a sense of humour in the design of our hotels, and a sense of humour never goes out of style.\" </p> <p>Needless to say, Schrager's staff are consummately chic, from the blond bellhop with his hi-tech wristwatch at the Hudson to the young women who work the front desk at the Sanderson. \"They're not merely good-looking,\" insists Schrager. \"That has nothing to do with it. We look for enthusiasm and people who are personable. They want to be part of this thing as much as the guests do, they're actually contemporaries and peers of the people staying in the hotels, and they can banter with them.\" If it's old-fashioned servility that you require, these are not the hotels for you. There has been some criticism of staff attitude, particularly at the Hudson.\"We've made mistakes,\" he says, \"and we're still not quite as good as we should be with training, which we're hoping to get better at. Sometimes the places get so busy and so chaotic that it gets a little bit out of our control.\" </p> <p>Corporate, institutionalised hotel chains such as the Marriott, that started life in the 50s and 60s and that are based upon efficiency and uniformity, will, in Schrager's view, soon be a thing of the past - \"It's kind of over for them,\" he says matter of factly. This may sound like bravado, but judging by the growing number of his imitators, it may not be so far-fetched. He predicts that hotels will continue to become more specialised, more individualised, more theatrical. \"They'll be more than just somewhere to sleep, they will manifest something about the city they're in.\" </p> <p>Not that there isn't a place in Schrager's world view for the classics - he loves London's Claridge's and the Connaught, and New York's Carlysle. It is the reign of the corporate brand that he is challenging. So what happens if Schrager becomes the new Hilton, and the hotel counterculture becomes the dominant culture? Will he still consider himself a maverick, an anti-establishment figure? By then, he'll have retired, he says, or be doing something else. \"The music I listened to as a kid - the Stones, the Beatles - that was so rebellious at the time, it became mainstream. Now it's hip-hop and house and more edgy music that has taken its place, that's the ebb and flow of life, that's just the way culture goes.\" </p> <p>Now that Schrager has reached middle age, and now that he and his wife Rita have two daughters, Sophia, six, and Ava, three, it is not surprising that his interests are beginning to diversify. Fortunately for him, his personal preoccupations chime rather well with the culture of the early 21st century - the louche nightclub dancefloor giving way to the hip hotel bar. Having effectively negotiated, and to some extent helped define, the zeitgeist of the past three decades, he looks set to move with the times again. The Sanderson and the Delano now boast \"urban spas\". The spa, or \"Agua\" as it's known, at the Sanderson, with its billowing 40ft-high white curtains, Louis XV chairs and generously heaped fruit bowls, is a whimsical take on paradise, like sitting in a cloud. With its purifying, detoxifying treatments and its tranquil atmosphere, it counterbalances the cocktail frenzy of his \"lobby culture\". </p> <p>Schrager knows exactly what he's doing. \"There is a collective consciousness and unconsciousness, and we do all move in a certain way for some strange reason. People are very concerned now about how they look and how they feel and spirituality and wellbeing.\" The culmination of the spa idea will be the first non-urban Schrager venture, a resort hotel due to open in the wilds of Santa Barbara next year.

      "bodyText": "The young man dressed in black appears to be speaking to his wristwatch. Except it's not a watch. It's some kind of minuscule walkie-talkie strapped to his wrist, in the style of a baddy in Mission: Impossible, say, or The Matrix. \"Location required for two medium-sized pieces of luggage,\" he says to his wrist. There's a pause, then the response comes back. Affirmative - location found. Over and out. The young man is a bellhop at New York's Hudson hotel, and we've asked him if he can store our bags for a couple of hours until we leave to catch our flight home. A bit of a palaver, the stunt with the walkie-talkie - a bit of a performance. But that's the whole point of the Hudson. For Ian Schrager's modish hotels, of which the Hudson is the newest and biggest, are all about performance. The exteriors are unobtrusive, but inside they are designed (by Philippe Starck) like whimsical stage sets, full of skewed proportions and vertiginous angles. The entrance to the Royalton, also in New York, is essentially a catwalk - a raised platform that runs through the bar - an exhibitionist's dream, along which you must walk, or sashay. At the Hudson, a glass-enclosed escalator in a vivid shaft of yellow light transports you up to the 40ft-high, glass-roofed lobby. They, the hotels, are also about atmosphere. \"It makes you want to drink,\" said a teetotal New Yorker friend as he emerged from the futuristic, translucent Hudson bar, where the glass floor literally lights up. Since its opening, people have been queueing along the street at weekends just to have a drink here. Yet, such is the ingenious sleight of hand that Schrager pulls off, the appeal of his hotels is their exclusivity, or rather the illusion of exclusivity. An eager young Englishman in the Hudson's \"library\" bar informed us that the previous evening Harrison Ford had been sitting in the very same capacious leather armchair that I was now occupying. Jack Nicholson loves the macaroni cheese, someone else told us in the restaurant. Well, if it's good enough for Jack... The highly profitable Schrager formula - last year, the business is said to have made a $120m profit - is predicated on the whiff of glamour and celebrity that pervades his establishments. Maybe a little of that lustre, that sex appeal will rub off on the rest of us. Ker-ching! The 54-year-old Schrager, inventor of the \"boutique hotel\" or \"destination hotel\", is largely responsible for a sea change in the hotel industry (although, with 900 rooms, the Hudson makes a rather large boutique). You only have to flick through glossy magazines such as Wallpaper* or Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller, or books such as the best-selling Hip Hotels series, to see that the Schrager game plan extends far beyond his own domain. In modern city travel there is a decisive move away from the sameness summed up by the old Holiday Inn slogan \"the best surprise is no surprise\". It was a trend that Schrager kickstarted in 1984 with his first hotel, Morgans, and followed up with the Royalton and Paramount, all in New York. The art of lobby culture was born, or reborn, and these hotels became hot spots for locals and guests alike. Miami's Delano (where Madonna co-owns the restaurant) followed, and the Mondrian in West Hollywood. Schrager has opened in London, too, with St Martins Lane and the Sanderson (with holographic lifts and a stained-glass-windowed billiards room) equally beloved by the jet set and would-be jet set. If anyone should know about celebrity and glamour - and their sleazy downside - it's Schrager, the man who created the legendary 70s New York nightclub, Studio 54 (and later, in the 80s, Palladium, one of the biggest clubs New York has ever seen). Studio 54 was the mecca of the disco generation, where Bianca Jagger famously once made a grand entrance on a white horse. It is remembered as a hedonistic hang-out, where Warhol sat and watched as Mick, Margaux, Liza and Truman Capote caroused, along with the hosts of extravagantly dressed decadents, druggies and party people who also managed to gain entry. Two films, The Last Days Of Disco and 54, have re-told the story of the club's rise and ultimate fall - a dramatic raid, and the arrest and imprisonment of its owners, Schrager and Steve Rubell, for tax evasion in 1980. Nightclub entrepreneur was not a career that was mapped out for Schrager, he says, nor even hotelier, when he was growing up in Brooklyn's East Flatbush. His parents brought him up with \"middle class, maybe somewhat provincial, values\" (rumours of his father's alleged mob connections have always been flatly denied by Schrager). \"The entertainment business would have been taboo to them.\" In any case, as it turned out, his parents would never know of their son's career path - Schrager senior died when his son was just 19, and Ian lost his mother five years after that. By then he had trained at Syracuse University to become an attorney, and it was there that he met fellow Brooklynite Steve Rubell. Schrager practised law for a while, but then the pair \"fell into\" the nightclub business, \"you didn't need much capital\". They were a winning team - Rubell was flamboyant and gay, Schrager reserved and straight. Their friendship and business partnership lasted until Rubell's death of an Aids-related illness in 1989. \"I'll never have the kind of friendship I had with Steve, who I loved,\" says Schrager. \"We went to school together and grew up together and had our ups and downs together, and it was a really, y'know, unique and special thing.\" Nightclubs suited his fancy, he says, encompassing as they did many disciplines in an undisciplined, \"freewheeling\" way. Schrager always had the more detached approach of the two - Rubell was the front man, working the door and mingling flamboyantly, Schrager tended to stay put in the office at the back of the club, earning the nickname \"Greta\", after Garbo. Schrager famously never danced at Studio 54. But it is now widely considered to be his intuitive understanding of detail, of creating an ambience, that was the driving force behind the duo's success. But it was never an intellectual exercise, he insists. \"All you have is the atmosphere you create, it's about creating this magic and this excitement and this cachet because you really don't have anything else distinguishable from other nightclubs.\" Studio 54 was the paradigm for Schrager's subsequent ventures, but also for much of late 20th-century, urban nightlife. The media frenzy, the celeb clientele, the smart design - all of these became commonplace in urban bars and clubs in the decades that followed. And it was here that the \"velvet rope\" approach to nightclub access was pioneered - the rope was the barrier between the in-crowd, handpicked by Rubell from the throng who assembled nightly on the pavement outside, and the forlorn rejects. Schrager has always dismissed accusations of elitism. \"I used to say it's the most democratic club of them all, because it has nothing to do with wealth or race or religion or creed. It does have to do with a spirit, an attitude.\" He says he used to see \"people in ballgowns dancing with people in jeans\", and that is a sensibility that has stayed with him. The hedonistic mood, too, has since become legendary. It was a different time, \"much druggier, not as cerebral or social as now - the time for that kind of thing has come and gone\". The wildness can be overplayed, he says: \"It wasn't debauchery, as legend has it, it wasn't that bad.\" Schrager had grown up in New York in the 60s when, he says, it was the black population who had set the cultural agenda. \"In the 70s, it was the gay population's time to emerge and set the cultural tone.\" It was also a time when the Pill and the liberation that came with it had begun to take off. \"All of this was hitting its stride,\" he says. In the States, the 70s were known as the \"me decade\" (a label more usually attributed to the 80s here), and nothing encapsulated that sensibility more than Studio 54. \"Everyone was really self-involved, and that self-involvement necessarily led to a lot of indulgence.\" Now, the mood of celebratory sexual permissiveness that Studio 54 was known for seems outdated, a sensibility defined by, and contained within, its era.\"My memories are really ones of spontaneity and innocence and naivety,\" says Schrager. \"It was pre-Aids, pre all of the things that we've subsequently learned about the price we pay, and about the things that aren't good for you or aren't appropriate or aren't right. It was like, anything goes. But I don't look on it as Sodom and Gomorrah. No, I look on it as, y'know, the Baby Boomers having a real impact on culture and flexing their muscles and experimenting.\" But it couldn't last. The club was raided by Internal Revenue Service agents in 1979. They found nearly $1m stashed in bin bags concealed in the ceiling of the office, and it was estimated that another $2.5m had been skimmed. How did they think they could get away with it? Did their success and the mood of the time make them feel invincible? \"Invincible - I'm not sure. Intoxicated with the whole thing, yes. It was like a lightning bolt, like holding on to a lightning bolt.\" The club closed in 1980, and Schrager and Rubell were sentenced to three years in jail. They served one year at the Maxwell Federal Prison Camp in Montgomery, Alabama. It was a reflective time for Schrager, and a \"completely humbling\" one. But it didn't quash the pair's enthusiasm or passion, and it was during their time inside that they decided to go into the hotel business. His father used to say, it's okay to make a mistake, but it's not okay if you don't pick yourself up afterwards and start over again. He thinks it would have killed his parents to have seen their son sent to jail, but he hopes that they would be proud if they could see him now. He has friends whose parents are starting to die now. \"I say to them, 'Well, at least they got to see you successful, and got to see your kids and see the fruits of their labours.' My parents were deprived of that.\" Schrager bounced back with notable resilience. Many of the team working for ISH (Ian Schrager Hotels, now a very large business concern) have known him since the Studio 54 days. Along with Starck, there is Anda Andreiou, a Romanian-born architect who has worked with Schrager since his first hotel and now oversees a team of architects. She says that her boss is not always easy, \"But I don't think anything really good came out of easy. His best quality is how much he can push us all when it comes to design. You end up giving 110%, when you never even knew you had it in you.\" The philosophy - according to Schrager - is egalitarian: he is a populist. He never relies on a traditional formula of luxury. \"The trimmings of wealth are not as important to me and my generation as they were to my parents' generation. Status based on wealth is an old-fashioned idea, I find it repugnant, actually.\" It's true that his hotels, notably the Hudson and the Paramount, are comparatively affordable ($95 for a single room; from $175 for a standard) - though the more inexpensive rooms are modestly sized. Historically, grand hotels conferred a social status on their guests that was to do with wealth and class; the cachet that Schrager confers is something else. The same principle that applied in the Studio 54 era applies now. It's the status of \"I'm in the know,\" he says, \"not, 'I'm in the money.' Great ideas have no attachment to either money or class.\" The tendency of many people to desire access to the supposedly inaccessible is as prevalent now as it was in Studio 54's heyday - probably more so. And he is as shrewd as he ever was at exploiting that. The notion that only those with a certain imponderable \"sensibility\" check in to a Schrager hotel makes guests feel like they are gaining access to some kind of exclusive club. His hotels do not suit everyone, of course. Some find the rooms claustrophobic, the ambience precious or pretentious. Some find them intimidating, suitable only for fashion victims. \"If they do intimidate, then we fail, that's not our goal. We never want to do something that only the critics like, or that only a few select groups like,\" he says. \"But also,\" he adds, \"they're not for everyone, our hotels, and that's their strength.\" He defends their design, too. \"They can't be pigeon-holed, they're not minimalist or trendy, they're the opposite of that. We have a sense of humour in the design of our hotels, and a sense of humour never goes out of style.\" Needless to say, Schrager's staff are consummately chic, from the blond bellhop with his hi-tech wristwatch at the Hudson to the young women who work the front desk at the Sanderson. \"They're not merely good-looking,\" insists Schrager. \"That has nothing to do with it. We look for enthusiasm and people who are personable. They want to be part of this thing as much as the guests do, they're actually contemporaries and peers of the people staying in the hotels, and they can banter with them.\" If it's old-fashioned servility that you require, these are not the hotels for you. There has been some criticism of staff attitude, particularly at the Hudson.\"We've made mistakes,\" he says, \"and we're still not quite as good as we should be with training, which we're hoping to get better at. Sometimes the places get so busy and so chaotic that it gets a little bit out of our control.\" Corporate, institutionalised hotel chains such as the Marriott, that started life in the 50s and 60s and that are based upon efficiency and uniformity, will, in Schrager's view, soon be a thing of the past - \"It's kind of over for them,\" he says matter of factly. This may sound like bravado, but judging by the growing number of his imitators, it may not be so far-fetched. He predicts that hotels will continue to become more specialised, more individualised, more theatrical. \"They'll be more than just somewhere to sleep, they will manifest something about the city they're in.\" Not that there isn't a place in Schrager's world view for the classics - he loves London's Claridge's and the Connaught, and New York's Carlysle. It is the reign of the corporate brand that he is challenging. So what happens if Schrager becomes the new Hilton, and the hotel counterculture becomes the dominant culture? Will he still consider himself a maverick, an anti-establishment figure? By then, he'll have retired, he says, or be doing something else. \"The music I listened to as a kid - the Stones, the Beatles - that was so rebellious at the time, it became mainstream. Now it's hip-hop and house and more edgy music that has taken its place, that's the ebb and flow of life, that's just the way culture goes.\" Now that Schrager has reached middle age, and now that he and his wife Rita have two daughters, Sophia, six, and Ava, three, it is not surprising that his interests are beginning to diversify. Fortunately for him, his personal preoccupations chime rather well with the culture of the early 21st century - the louche nightclub dancefloor giving way to the hip hotel bar. Having effectively negotiated, and to some extent helped define, the zeitgeist of the past three decades, he looks set to move with the times again. The Sanderson and the Delano now boast \"urban spas\". The spa, or \"Agua\" as it's known, at the Sanderson, with its billowing 40ft-high white curtains, Louis XV chairs and generously heaped fruit bowls, is a whimsical take on paradise, like sitting in a cloud. With its purifying, detoxifying treatments and its tranquil atmosphere, it counterbalances the cocktail frenzy of his \"lobby culture\". Schrager knows exactly what he's doing. \"There is a collective consciousness and unconsciousness, and we do all move in a certain way for some strange reason. People are very concerned now about how they look and how they feel and spirituality and wellbeing.\" The culmination of the spa idea will be the first non-urban Schrager venture, a resort hotel due to open in the wilds of Santa Barbara next year. It will be stylish and sophisticated, but \"modest\". A return to simplicity? \"We're taking the idea of wellbeing and health and getting close to nature and trying to recreate the kind of excitement we had as children, like I remember as a young boy in summer camp.\" When he looks back at the final days of Studio 54 in the 70s, he fondly thinks of them as the \"last days of innocence\". Innocence looks very different at the beginning of the 21st century. So does the illusion of innocence. Can he pull it off again - in a summer camp for grown-ups?",

      "body": "<p>In his 30 years of showing prospective buyers around properties, estate agent Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy has never once smelled the aroma of fresh coffee nor the warm, comforting whiff of hastily-baked bread. It's a shocking revelation from a man who has had the voyeuristic pleasure of stepping inside thousands of homes, especially to the halfwits among us who actually believed the myths.</p> <p>\"Few people have the competence to bake bread,\" says the chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents, \"and I've never really bought the one about coffee. I don't think people will spend \u00a3500,000 on a house because it smells like a cafe. Offering a coffee, on the other hand, goes down a bundle in creating goodwill.\"</p> <p>It's a refreshing thought that straightforward fawning can work where the complex science of aromatherapy can't - but you'd expect an estate agent to think of that. What troubles me is the way you will be judged when you start offering hospitality to strangers. Will potential buyers sneer and go elsewhere when they realise your coffee is instant? Will they shave a few grand off the price if you run out of Fair Trade Mocha Java or Ethiopian Sidamo and offer them Douwe Egberts instead? What if they only drink tea?</p> <p>It may sound paranoid, but when people view a property they are viewing the owners as well. Daphne Leck, a \"house doctor\" with Property Presentation Services - a US-style consultancy that helps vendors \"dress\" their homes for sale - believes the seller's image and possessions are almost as important as the building itself. \"Potential buyers do have an idea of the kind of lifestyle they will have in that property, so they will be put off by white melamine furniture but encouraged by the right kind of kitchen appliance or tasteful antiques. That is particularly the case in London, where prices are so aspirationally high.\" Perhaps the old trick of displaying a music stand in the front room, beaming out an impression of cultured bohemianism and classical erudition, really does work.</p> <p>The truth is, homebuyers are a lot more savvy than they were - and TV programmes such as Changing Rooms and Home Front have given people a false sense of aesthetic superiority. If Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen is an \"expert\", interior design can't be that difficult. \"In the 80s, it was cookery programmes,\" says Leck, \"but now the obsession is with homes and gardens. Everyone wants to do what Laurence says.\" I ask whether the old advice about baking bread is a culinary 80s thing as well, but Leck thinks it goes back further: \"That was doing the rounds in the 70s - and it still is. Estate agents just haven't grown up.\"</p> <p>As she points out, there are practical reasons why making your kitchen smell like a patisserie doesn't work. \"It just makes people feel hungry,\" she says, \"so they'll go dashing off to McDonald's instead of taking a good look at your home.\"</p> <p>So what are the house doctor's tips for making a home sell - if not smell - like a hot, organic wholemeal bloomer? \"Smell is important,\" says Leck, \"but we've come a long way since the 70s when people sprayed chemical room fresheners all over the place. Now, the move is towards more natural, subtle smells - like scented candles. Good old fresh air is making a comeback, too, so open the windows for half an hour before the viewers arrive.\"</p> <p>Another trend is feng shui - though Leck warns that banishing spiky plants, sawing the corners off tables and preventing positive \"qi\" from escaping down the lavatory may not pay the dividends you think. \"It's a bit of a fad, and buyers simply won't notice unless they are of that mindset themselves. But it's true that the loo seat does look better down rather than up.\"</p> <p>Then there are all those other old chestnuts, like the one about a nice fitted kitchen from Ikea adding thousands to the value of your home. \"Free-standing kitchen units are much more popular these days,\" says Leck, \"and it's more the look of the kitchen that counts. The problem is, it is so subjective. The acme of style to you may just look like a waste of money to the viewer who walks in through your door.\"</p> <p>Paul Williams, managing director of Holden Matthews estate agents, in north London, is doubtful that even the ultimate bourgeois accessory - a stainless-steel Smeg cooker with a rotisserie big enough to chargrill eight chickens - will necessarily shift a home. \"Most of the properties we're selling in Islington are worth half a million pounds,\" he says. \"Anyone with that kind of money will have pretty strong views about what they want. They'll see straight through a Smeg cooker.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the most dubious of accessories is children. With three or four of those romping round the house, you will never persuade anyone to buy. That is the view of another agent at Holden Matthews, who described having children around during a viewing as \"a complete waste of time\". The company's leaflet for vendors puts it more subtly (\"Keep children and pets at bay...\"), but most property professionals agree that the patter of tiny feet is a turn-off for buyers. \"Ask a neighbour to babysit,\" urges Pamela Hadaway, a house doctor with The Wow Factor, \"ideally elsewhere. Then you can give your undivided attention to the visitor.\" Only Daphne Leck seems to have latched on to the contentious millennial view that children are humans, and a part of your home, rather than things to be tidied away. \"Estate agents send out videos,\" she says, \"showing houses before and after being prepared for sale. They are completely desolate places. Moving house is a hard time for kids, and making them invisible will not make you the best of friends.\" Nevertheless, she suggests arranging viewings only when the children are out at school.</p> <p>Most of the advice on offer is mind-numbingly obvious (throw away clutter, tend the garden, mend the leaking tap) but there are a few unexpected gems. \"Mode of dress is important,\" says Pamela Hadaway. \"Look well-off when selling, and slightly less well-off when buying.\" She also suggests sending pets to the beauty parlour, brushing spiders' webs from bushes, and placing \"big bold plants about 4ft high\" in bathrooms to divert attention from \"mouldy old taps\". Her advice on estate agents' photographs is: \"Avoid snow, which proves it's been on the market since last winter - and try not to show the estate agent's car parked in the drive.\"</p> <p>\"Trim hedges, hide dustbins, paint the front door and polish the door furniture,\" urges the Holden Matthews brochure - houseproud gestures that might invite instant burglary in the less salubrious areas of some inner cities. Sometimes it is more sensible to leave your house looking like a squat.</p> <p>There is, of course, a complacent inertia that can prevent a property from realising its market potential. When you've lived in a dump for a while, you become blind to the depravity of your circumstances. But sometimes that doesn't matter. In one house he was selling in Cambridge, Stewart Chipchase, of agents FPD Savills, found \"16,000 books on the upper floors, and every inch cluttered with grass cuttings, broken lawn mowers, supermarket baskets full of unopened tins and food packets - and dog poo!\" The house sold within three weeks.</p> <p>All this begs the question of whether house doctors are worth their fee. When I cast my mind back to why we chose our property, the thing I remember most is the stench of rotting fish. Mind you, there was a log fire blazing and classical music playing - so the guy had read the right leaflets. The thing that really swayed us, though, was that our children fell in love with the place. I'm sure Pamela Hadaway of The Wow Factor would have something to say about that.

      "bodyText": "In his 30 years of showing prospective buyers around properties, estate agent Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy has never once smelled the aroma of fresh coffee nor the warm, comforting whiff of hastily-baked bread. It's a shocking revelation from a man who has had the voyeuristic pleasure of stepping inside thousands of homes, especially to the halfwits among us who actually believed the myths. \"Few people have the competence to bake bread,\" says the chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents, \"and I've never really bought the one about coffee. I don't think people will spend \u00a3500,000 on a house because it smells like a cafe. Offering a coffee, on the other hand, goes down a bundle in creating goodwill.\" It's a refreshing thought that straightforward fawning can work where the complex science of aromatherapy can't - but you'd expect an estate agent to think of that. What troubles me is the way you will be judged when you start offering hospitality to strangers. Will potential buyers sneer and go elsewhere when they realise your coffee is instant? Will they shave a few grand off the price if you run out of Fair Trade Mocha Java or Ethiopian Sidamo and offer them Douwe Egberts instead? What if they only drink tea? It may sound paranoid, but when people view a property they are viewing the owners as well. Daphne Leck, a \"house doctor\" with Property Presentation Services - a US-style consultancy that helps vendors \"dress\" their homes for sale - believes the seller's image and possessions are almost as important as the building itself. \"Potential buyers do have an idea of the kind of lifestyle they will have in that property, so they will be put off by white melamine furniture but encouraged by the right kind of kitchen appliance or tasteful antiques. That is particularly the case in London, where prices are so aspirationally high.\" Perhaps the old trick of displaying a music stand in the front room, beaming out an impression of cultured bohemianism and classical erudition, really does work. The truth is, homebuyers are a lot more savvy than they were - and TV programmes such as Changing Rooms and Home Front have given people a false sense of aesthetic superiority. If Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen is an \"expert\", interior design can't be that difficult. \"In the 80s, it was cookery programmes,\" says Leck, \"but now the obsession is with homes and gardens. Everyone wants to do what Laurence says.\" I ask whether the old advice about baking bread is a culinary 80s thing as well, but Leck thinks it goes back further: \"That was doing the rounds in the 70s - and it still is. Estate agents just haven't grown up.\" As she points out, there are practical reasons why making your kitchen smell like a patisserie doesn't work. \"It just makes people feel hungry,\" she says, \"so they'll go dashing off to McDonald's instead of taking a good look at your home.\" So what are the house doctor's tips for making a home sell - if not smell - like a hot, organic wholemeal bloomer? \"Smell is important,\" says Leck, \"but we've come a long way since the 70s when people sprayed chemical room fresheners all over the place. Now, the move is towards more natural, subtle smells - like scented candles. Good old fresh air is making a comeback, too, so open the windows for half an hour before the viewers arrive.\" Another trend is feng shui - though Leck warns that banishing spiky plants, sawing the corners off tables and preventing positive \"qi\" from escaping down the lavatory may not pay the dividends you think. \"It's a bit of a fad, and buyers simply won't notice unless they are of that mindset themselves. But it's true that the loo seat does look better down rather than up.\" Then there are all those other old chestnuts, like the one about a nice fitted kitchen from Ikea adding thousands to the value of your home. \"Free-standing kitchen units are much more popular these days,\" says Leck, \"and it's more the look of the kitchen that counts. The problem is, it is so subjective. The acme of style to you may just look like a waste of money to the viewer who walks in through your door.\" Paul Williams, managing director of Holden Matthews estate agents, in north London, is doubtful that even the ultimate bourgeois accessory - a stainless-steel Smeg cooker with a rotisserie big enough to chargrill eight chickens - will necessarily shift a home. \"Most of the properties we're selling in Islington are worth half a million pounds,\" he says. \"Anyone with that kind of money will have pretty strong views about what they want. They'll see straight through a Smeg cooker.\" Perhaps the most dubious of accessories is children. With three or four of those romping round the house, you will never persuade anyone to buy. That is the view of another agent at Holden Matthews, who described having children around during a viewing as \"a complete waste of time\". The company's leaflet for vendors puts it more subtly (\"Keep children and pets at bay...\"), but most property professionals agree that the patter of tiny feet is a turn-off for buyers. \"Ask a neighbour to babysit,\" urges Pamela Hadaway, a house doctor with The Wow Factor, \"ideally elsewhere. Then you can give your undivided attention to the visitor.\" Only Daphne Leck seems to have latched on to the contentious millennial view that children are humans, and a part of your home, rather than things to be tidied away. \"Estate agents send out videos,\" she says, \"showing houses before and after being prepared for sale. They are completely desolate places. Moving house is a hard time for kids, and making them invisible will not make you the best of friends.\" Nevertheless, she suggests arranging viewings only when the children are out at school. Most of the advice on offer is mind-numbingly obvious (throw away clutter, tend the garden, mend the leaking tap) but there are a few unexpected gems. \"Mode of dress is important,\" says Pamela Hadaway. \"Look well-off when selling, and slightly less well-off when buying.\" She also suggests sending pets to the beauty parlour, brushing spiders' webs from bushes, and placing \"big bold plants about 4ft high\" in bathrooms to divert attention from \"mouldy old taps\". Her advice on estate agents' photographs is: \"Avoid snow, which proves it's been on the market since last winter - and try not to show the estate agent's car parked in the drive.\" \"Trim hedges, hide dustbins, paint the front door and polish the door furniture,\" urges the Holden Matthews brochure - houseproud gestures that might invite instant burglary in the less salubrious areas of some inner cities. Sometimes it is more sensible to leave your house looking like a squat. There is, of course, a complacent inertia that can prevent a property from realising its market potential. When you've lived in a dump for a while, you become blind to the depravity of your circumstances. But sometimes that doesn't matter. In one house he was selling in Cambridge, Stewart Chipchase, of agents FPD Savills, found \"16,000 books on the upper floors, and every inch cluttered with grass cuttings, broken lawn mowers, supermarket baskets full of unopened tins and food packets - and dog poo!\" The house sold within three weeks. All this begs the question of whether house doctors are worth their fee. When I cast my mind back to why we chose our property, the thing I remember most is the stench of rotting fish. Mind you, there was a log fire blazing and classical music playing - so the guy had read the right leaflets. The thing that really swayed us, though, was that our children fell in love with the place. I'm sure Pamela Hadaway of The Wow Factor would have something to say about that. She refers to children as \"disposable assets\" and says they shouldn't really be allowed to view properties. Not only are they a distraction, but ornaments can vanish \"into little pockets\". \"I don't know about you,\" she says, \"but I've got lots of porcelain, crystal and silver in my house which I'd very much like to keep intact.\" As the house doctors say, taste is very subjective Selling your home: What the experts say Tip: Offer a coffee.

In a twist on the old line about opera - that that which is too ridiculous to be spoken can be redeemed by the addition of music - we now have the spectacle of deeply reactionary views about homosexuals (perverts) and sexually active women (sluts) being hailed as radical art, whereas if a Tory MP was to come out with something half as strong they'd be dismissed as an ignorant bigot.

When Luc arrived, the firefighters were bringing out the bodies. All his life he will remember the sealed grey plastic bags into which they had put the children: too horrible to look at. Florence, Mrs Romand, had simply been covered with a coat. Her face, blackened by the smoke, was unmarked. Smoothing her hair in a desolate gesture of farewell, Luc's fingers encountered something strange. He felt around, carefully tilting the young woman's head to one side, then called over a firefighter to show him, at the base of the skull, an open wound. It must have been from a beam that fell on her, the firefighter said; part of the attic had collapsed. Luc then clambered into the red vehicle where the rescuers had placed Jean-Claude, Florence's husband, the only one of the family who was still alive. His pulse was weak. He was in pyjamas, unconscious, burned yet already as cold as a corpse.</p> <p>Luc and Jean-Claude had been friends ever since medical school in Lyon. They'd got married almost at the same time; their children had grown up together. Each knew everything about the other's life - the public image, but also the secrets, the secrets of honest, reliable men who were all the more vulnerable to temptation. When Jean-Claude had confided in him about an affair, talked about chucking everything in, Luc had made him listen to reason. Their lives were very similar, even if they hadn't succeeded in the same way. Jean-Claude had become a leading figure in the world of medical research, hobnobbing with government ministers, always off at international conferences, while Luc was a GP in Ferney-Voltaire, a town on the French side of the Swiss border, just a few miles north of Geneva. The Romands lived in the nearby village of Pr\u00e9vessin.</p> <p>Later that Monday morning, Luc phoned the casualty department in Geneva: Jean-Claude, who was 38, had been placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber; the prognosis was guarded. Luc prayed with his wife C\u00e9cile and the children that he would never regain consciousness.</p> <p>When Luc went to his office, two policemen were waiting for him. Their questions seemed odd. They wanted to know if the Romands had any enemies, if they'd been involved in any suspicious activities... Seeing Luc's astonishment, the police told him the truth. An initial examination of the bodies revealed that the victims had died before the fire, Florence from head injuries inflicted by a blunt instrument, the children - five-year-old Antoine and seven-year-old Caroline - from bullet wounds.</p> <p>That wasn't all. In Clairvaux-les-Lacs, in the Jura Mountains some 50 miles to the north-west of Ferney, Jean-Claude's uncle had been delegated to break the tragic news to the injured man's parents, a frail elderly couple. Accompanied by their doctor, he had found the house locked, the dog mysteriously silent. Worried, the uncle had broken open the door to discover his brother, his sister-in-law and the dog lying in their own blood. They, too, had been shot.</p> <p>Murdered. The Romands had been murdered. The word echoed through Luc's brain, stunning him. \"Was it a robbery?\" he asked, as if that word might somehow reduce the horror. The officers asked again about possible enemies, and Luc, at a loss, shook his head. Enemies? The Romands? Everyone loved them. The police needed to find out exactly what Jean-Claude did for a living. A doctor, the neighbours had said, but he didn't have a surgery. Luc explained that he was a researcher at the World Health Organisation (WHO), in Geneva. One of the officers telephoned, asking to speak to someone who worked with Dr Romand. The receptionist did not know any Dr Romand. She connected the officer to the personnel director, who consulted his files and confirmed: there was no Dr Romand at WHO.</p> <p>In the course of that day, reality became even more nightmarish. Summoned to the police station in the afternoon, Luc learned that a note in Jean-Claude's handwriting confessing to the crimes had been found in his car and that everything people thought they knew about his career and professional activities was a sham. The WHO? No one there had ever heard of him. The national registry of physicians? He wasn't listed. The hospitals in Paris where he was said to be on the medical staff? He was not accredited there, nor was he a graduate of the medical school in Lyon where Luc himself, and several others, swore nevertheless to have been students with him. He had begun his studies, yes, but had stopped taking his exams at the end of the second year; from then on, it was all false. Latterly, Jean-Claude had confessed to Luc that he was suffering from cancer, for which he said he was being treated in Paris by the eminent oncologist L\u00e9on Schwartzenberg. Also false. Dr Schwartzenberg had no record of Jean-Claude Romand, nor had the oncology department of any other hospital in France.</p> <p>At first, Luc simply refused to believe this. When someone tells you that your best friend, your daughter's godfather, the most respectable man you know has killed his wife, his children, his parents, and that in addition he has been lying to you about everything for years, isn't it normal to go on believing in him, even in the face of overwhelming proof?</p> <p>It soon came out that Jean-Claude had an on-off relationship with a woman called Corinne Hourtin - a child psychologist, now divorced, who had once lived in Ferney with her husband R\u00e9mi. She had handed over to Jean-Claude 900,000 francs (about \u00a390,000) in savings that he was to have invested for her in Switzerland. He had embezzled it instead. Other revelations came from Florence's family, the Crolets. They, too, had entrusted money to Jean-Claude: first the father's retirement bonus, and then, after his death, a million francs netted from the sale of his house. Their grief was compounded by an agonising suspicion: M Crolet had died in a fall on a staircase when he was alone with Jean-Claude. Had he been yet another victim of his son-in-law?</p> <p>Everyone was wondering: how could we have lived beside this man for so long without suspecting a thing? Everyone tried to remember a moment when some suspicion had crossed their minds. Luc himself remembered that he'd been struck by something a few months earlier, after learning from Florence that Jean-Claude had ranked fifth in all of Paris in his finals. What astonished Luc wasn't this achievement but the fact that he hadn't learned of it at the time. Why hadn't Jean-Claude mentioned it? Questioned, accused of being secretive, Jean-Claude had shrugged, said he didn't want to make a big deal of it, and changed the subject. It was extraordinary, this ability to deflect conversation whenever it turned to him. Thinking back on it, you ended up admiring his discretion, his modesty, his desire to show others to advantage. Yet Luc had felt vaguely that there was something not quite right in what Jean-Claude said about his career. He'd considered calling WHO to discover exactly what it was he did there - but had decided the whole thing was absurd. And now he kept telling himself that if he'd gone through with it, maybe things would have turned out differently.</p> <p>\"Perhaps,\" said C\u00e9cile when he told her of his remorse, \"... perhaps he would have killed you as well.\"</p> <p>Three days after the fire, the Ladmirals learned that Jean-Claude was going to live.</p> <p>Jean-Claude Romand's early childhood was spent in a small village in the Jura where his father ran a farm. Neighbours, cousins, schoolteachers all remember a well-behaved little boy, quiet and sweet, whom some are tempted to describe as too well-behaved, too quiet, too sweet. An only child, perhaps somewhat overprotected by his mother. A child who never got up to any mischief, more respectable - if one can say that about a child - than truly lovable, but even so a child whom no one imagined to be unhappy. He says that his mother worried all the time and that he learned early on to mislead her so that she wouldn't worry even more. He admired his father for never showing his feelings and tried to imitate him. It was better to conceal them. On the one hand, he had been taught not to lie, and that was absolute dogma: a Romand was as good as his word, a Romand told the truth and shamed the Devil. On the other hand, there were certain things you shouldn't say, even if they were true. You had to avoid upsetting anyone, or boasting about your success or your good qualities.</p> <p>Romand achieves good grades at school. He originally plans to become a forester, but then changes his mind and decides to study medicine instead at Lyon. At the end of his second year, in 1975, he needs to resit one exam. He fails to turn up, but he tells no one, and no one notices.</p> <p>Three weeks went by between the day of the examination and the posting of the results. There was still time for him to admit that he had lied. It would have been hard for him, naturally. To this serious young man, it must have seemed impossibly painful to admit a whopping error, a childish blunder like that of Antoine Doinel in Les Quatre-Cent Coups, who extricates himself from a sticky situation at school by blurting out that his mother has just died, and who then must deal with the inevitable consequences of his lies and the certainty that the truth will come out. The most baffling thing, in Romand's case, is that he committed his folly in two stages, like the computer user who, having accidentally typed the command for erasing a valuable file, when asked by the program whether he's sure he wants to delete the file, carefully considers the pros and cons - then goes ahead and destroys it anyway. Rationally speaking, anything would have been better than what Jean-Claude did: he waited for the day the results were posted and then announced that he had passed, that he'd been accepted as a third-year medical student.</p> <p>How could he have foreseen that there was something worse than being quickly unmasked, which was not to be unmasked; how could he have suspected that this childish lie would lead him 18 years later to murder his parents, Florence, and the children he did not yet have?</p> <p>While still ostensibly studying medicine, Jean-Claude marries Florence Crolet, a fellow student at Lyon. He supposedly passes his medical board exam and becomes first a research assistant in a medical research institution and then a research scientist at the World Health Organisation in Geneva.</p> <p>Romand was always, as Florence put it, \"very compartmentalised\", strictly separating his personal and professional relations, never inviting colleagues from WHO to his house, refusing to allow himself to be disturbed at home by anyone from his office, or at work by any of his family or friends. Moreover, nobody had his office phone number, not even his wife, who contacted him through an answering service: you left a message in a voice mailbox, which sent him a signal on the bleeper he always carried with him, and then he quickly called back. Neither his wife nor anyone else found the arrangement strange. It was one of his personality traits, like his gruffness, which she often joked about: \"One of these days, I'm going to find out my husband's a communist spy.\"</p> <p>In the mornings, he was the one who drove the children to the Ecole Saint-Vincent. He would accompany them into the courtyard, exchange a few words with the teachers or the pupils' mothers, then drive off towards Geneva. More often than not he ended up in the car park of WHO. Entering with a visitor's badge, carrying a briefcase, he followed a familiar orbit, going from the ground-floor library to the conference rooms and the publications office, where he systematically swept up anything printed and free: his house and car overflowed with papers bearing the letterhead or stamp of WHO. He used all the services offered by the organisation - a post office where he sent his mail, a bank where he made most of his withdrawals, a travel agency through which he planned the family holidays - but did not risk going upstairs, where security guards might have asked him what he was looking for. His mother-in-law remembers that one Sunday when the whole family had gone to Switzerland, the children had wanted to see Papa's office, so Papa had agreed to the detour. They'd pulled into the car park, he'd pointed out the window. And that's all.</p> <p>At first he went to WHO every day, later less regularly. He'd stop at a news-stand to buy an armful of papers: dailies, magazines, scientific journals. Then he'd go and read them, either in a cafe - he was careful to change cafes often and to choose them far enough from home - or in his car. He would park in a car park or at a service station and stay there for hours, reading, taking notes, dozing. He'd have a sandwich for lunch and continue reading throughout the afternoon in a different cafe, at a different service station. Other days, he needed open air and nature, and would drive into the Jura Mountains.</p> <p>Lastly, there were the trips - conferences, seminars, symposiums, all over the world. He would buy a guide to the country; Florence would pack his suitcase. He'd drive off in his car, which he would supposedly leave in the long-term car park at Geneva airport. In a comfortable hotel room, often near the airport, he would take off his shoes, stretch out on the bed, spend three or four days watching television and the planes taking off and landing outside his window. He studied the guide books so he wouldn't make any mistakes in his stories when he got home. He telephoned his family every day to tell them what time it was and what the weather was like in Sao Paulo or Tokyo. He'd tell his wife, his children, his parents that he missed them, was thinking of them, sent them a big kiss. After a few days, he went home with presents bought in an airport gift shop. Everyone made a fuss of him. He was tired from jet lag.</p> <p>Indirectly it was WHO that provided Jean-Claude with a source of income. He said or let it be understood that as an international civil servant he was in a position to make extremely advantageous investments at a rate of 18%, an opportunity he could share with his family. Jean-Claude's parents were not the kind of people to cheat on their taxes by putting their savings into Swiss banks, but as it was their son's idea that was enough for them. Romand lived on their nest egg at the beginning of his marriage. Florence declared to the income tax authorities the very modest salary she earned by temporarily filling in for pharmacists in the area, and he declared no income because, since he worked in Switzerland, he had - he said - no taxes to pay.</p> <p>The year Antoine was born, Florence's father retired from his job in Annecy. A disguised redundancy, his retirement brought him a bonus of 400,000 francs. Jean-Claude agreed to do his father-in-law a favour by investing 378,000 francs for him at a Geneva bank. This sum was deposited in an account in Jean-Claude's name, since he was the one whose position entitled him to make such an investment. But one day Jean-Claude's father-in-law told him he wanted to withdraw part of his capital to buy a Mercedes. A few weeks later, on October 23, 1988, Pierre Crolet fell on the stairs of his home where he was alone with his son-in-law and died just before the arrival of the paramedics.</p> <p>After the fire, a new investigation was ordered at the request of the Crolet family. Of course, it uncovered nothing. At the end of the proceedings, Jean-Claude insisted on telling the Crolet family, as God was his witness, that he had had no hand in his father-in-law's death. Short of a confession on his part some day, we will never learn any more.</p> <p>What is indisputable is that the death of his father-in-law was providential for Romand. There was no longer any question of touching the money in the Swiss account. Then Mme Crolet decided to sell the house, now too large for her on her own, and handed over to her son-in-law the proceeds of the sale, which amounted to 1.3million francs.</p> <p>Romand had become enraptured with Corinne Hourtin and they begin an affair when she moves to Paris. But she soon decides that she could never love him. He confides in her, as he he did to Luc Ladmiral, that he is suffering from cancer. They remain friends, and she turns to him when she had money to invest, handing over 900,000 francs in cash. He flies from Paris with a small suitcase stuffed with notes. Soon after, Corinne decides she wants some of her money back, but finds Romand evasive.</p> <p>Just before the 1992 Christmas holidays, the president of the school board wanted to talk to Jean-Claude on the subject of a demoted head. The president did not know Jean-Claude well enough to be aware that one didn't call him at his office, and he had his secretary look up Jean-Claude's number in the WHO directory. Puzzled at not finding him anywhere, he imagined there must be some explanation, and he didn't think about it again until one day after the holiday when he ran into Florence in the main street of Ferney and told her about it. His tone wasn't that of a man who had suspicions but that of someone who was curious to find out the real story behind an odd mystery, and Florence reacted equally mildly. It was strange, yes, there was obviously a reason, and she'd speak to her husband about it. Florence and the man did not see each other again. One week later she was dead, and no one will ever know if she brought it up with Jean-Claude. He says she didn't.</p> <p>Although he was unsure where the first blow would come from, he knew that the hounds were closing in. His various bank accounts would soon be overdrawn, and he had no means of replenishing them. People were talking about him, and talking about coming after him. Hands were flipping through directories. The look in Florence's eyes had changed. He was scared.</p> <p>In the run-up to Christmas, he flew to Paris and took Corinne to dinner at the Restaurant Michel Rostang. Corinne told him that she had made up her mind and she wanted all of her money back. Instead of trying to wriggle out of it, he opened his diary to set up a meeting when he would hand over the funds. Turning the pages, he had an idea: he had agreed to have dinner at the start of the new year with his friend Bernard Kouchner, illustrious co-founder of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. Would Corinne like to join them? Of course Corinne would like that. Before then, though, he would be dead.</p> <p>On the flight home, he continued to study his diary. Christmas wasn't a good day, that would be too cruel for the children. Caroline was going to play Mary and Antoine one of the shepherds in the Nativity play at the church. So, right after New Year?</p> <p>Jean-Claude did not go to work on the Tuesday after the New Year. Florence and he ran errands in Ferney. She insisted that he buy a new suit; he let himself be tempted by a parka for 3,200 francs. The saleswoman thought they seemed a couple who were at leisure, well-off, and getting along fine.</p> <p>Jean-Claude had spent the morning studying books such as the Vidal pharmacological dictionary; he rejected drugs that caused instantaneous death in favour of barbiturates with a rapid serum peak for a comfortable lapse into unconsciousness. Everything would be ready by Friday, January 8, said the pharmacist, would that do? It would do.</p> <p>That evening, Romand read a story to the children. He left for Lyon on Wednesday morning. At 2.08pm he obtained 1,000 francs from the cashpoint, and another 1,000 francs at 2.45pm. Between the two withdrawals, he says, he gave a 500-franc note to a homeless person. Then, in a gun shop, he bought a stun wand, two tear gas canisters, a box of cartridges and a silencer for a .22 calibre rifle.</p> <p>\"So,\" the judge pointed out, \"you weren't thinking only of killing yourself. You were living with your wife and children while you were planning to kill them.\"</p> <p>\"That idea did surface... but it was immediately masked by other false plans, other false ideas. It was as though the idea didn't exist... I pretended... I told myself I was doing something else, that it was for a different reason, and at the same time... at the same time I was buying the bullets that would pierce my children's hearts.\"</p> <p>He sobbed.</p> <p>On the Thursday, Jean-Claude went to visit his parents in Clairvaux. The next day, after the children had gone to bed, Florence had a long phone conversation with her mother. Mme Crolet complained bitterly about being a widow, about growing old, about being neglected by her children. Her unhappiness affected Florence, who began crying after she hung up. Jean-Claude joined her on the sofa. That is the last image he has. He is sitting next to her, he has taken her in his arms, he is trying to comfort her.</p> <p>\"I don't remember her last words.\" He went on: \"I am unable to say what happened between the time when I was consoling Florence on the sofa and the moment I woke up holding the rolling pin stained with blood.\"</p> <p>Early that Saturday morning, the telephone rang, which woke the children. They were always quicker to bounce out of bed on days when they didn't have school. Jean-Claude told them that Mama was still sleeping, and the three of them went downstairs to the living room. He put a tape of The Three Little Pigs in the video, prepared bowls of Coco Pops with milk. With him in the middle, they settled themselves on the sofa to watch the cartoon while they ate their cereal.</p> <p>\"I knew after having killed Florence that I was also going to kill Antoine and Caroline and that those moments in front of the television were the last that we would spend together. I cuddled them. I must have said sweet things to them, like, 'I love you.' \"</p> <p>\"We stayed like that for perhaps an hour... Caroline saw that I was cold, she wanted to go upstairs to get my dressing gown... I said that I thought they seemed rather hot, that perhaps they had a fever and I was going to take their temperature. Caroline went upstairs with me, I had her lie down on her bed... I went to get the rifle ...\"</p> <p>\"What did you say to Caroline?\" asked the judge.</p> <p>\"I don't know any more... She'd lain down on her stomach... That's when I shot her.\"</p> <p>\"Go on...\"</p> <p>He sobbed. \"I shot Caroline the first time... She had a pillow over her head... I must have been pretending it was a game.\" Here he moaned, his eyes closed. \"I pulled the trigger... I put the rifle somewhere in the room... I called Antoine... and I did it again.\"</p> <p>\"Perhaps I should help you a bit, because the jury needs details and you're not being specific enough.\"</p> <p>\"Caroline, when she was born, it was the most wonderful day of my life... She was beautiful\" - he moaned - \"in my arms... for her first bath.\" A spasm shook his body. \"I'm the one who killed her... I'm the one who killed her.\"</p> <p>The policemen, appalled, held him gently by the arms.</p> <p>\"Don't you think Antoine could have heard the gunshots? Had you attached the silencer? Did you call him upstairs on the same pretext? To take his temperature? He didn't find that strange?\"</p> <p>\"I don't have an image of that precise moment. It was still them, but it couldn't be Caroline... it couldn't be Antoine...\"</p> <p>The prosecutor spoke up. Afterwards, he said, Romand went out to buy the local paper and a sports daily, L'Equipe, and the newspaper seller thought he looked completely normal.</p> <p>\"Were you trying to behave as if nothing had happened, as if life was going on as usual?\"</p> <p>\"I couldn't have bought L'Equipe. I never read it.\"</p> <p>\"Neighbours saw you cross the street to check your postbox.\"</p> <p>\"Did I do it to deny reality, to pretend?\"</p> <p>\"Why did you wrap up the rifle and carefully put it away before you left for Clairvaux?\"</p> <p>\"In reality, to kill them, of course, but I must have told myself that it was to return it to my father.\"</p> <p>Jean-Claude does not remember the drive to his parents' home later on the Saturday morning. We know the three of them had lunch together. Dishes were still on the table when Uncle Claude entered the house two days later, and the postmortem examination revealed that the stomachs of Aim\u00e9 and Anne-Marie Romand were full. Did Jean-Claude eat anything? Did his mother urge him to have something? What did they talk about?</p> <p>First he lured his father upstairs with the excuse of examining a malodorous air vent the old man had complained about. The old man, who couldn't bend over because of back trouble, must have knelt down to point out the defective vent, which was set into the skirting-board. That was when he received two bullets in the back. His son covered him with a wine-coloured corduroy bedspread that had been in the room since Jean-Claude's childhood. Then he went to get his mother. She hadn't heard the gunshots, fired with a silencer. He made her go into the sitting room, which they never used. She was the only one who was shot from the front.</p> <p>He carefully closed up the house and drove off at around two o'clock. He was heading for Paris where he was to meet Corinne.</p> <p>\u0095 Read the second part of the story <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,421545,00.html\"> here</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 Taken from the book The Adversary by Emmanuel Carr\u00e9re and translated by Linda Coverdale to be published by Bloomsbury on 22 January 2001 at \u009514.99</p>",

      "bodyText": "Luc Ladmiral was awakened shortly after 4am on the morning of Monday, January 11, 1993, by a telephone call. His friends the Romands' house was on fire; he should come. When Luc arrived, the firefighters were bringing out the bodies. All his life he will remember the sealed grey plastic bags into which they had put the children: too horrible to look at. Florence, Mrs Romand, had simply been covered with a coat. Her face, blackened by the smoke, was unmarked. Smoothing her hair in a desolate gesture of farewell, Luc's fingers encountered something strange. He felt around, carefully tilting the young woman's head to one side, then called over a firefighter to show him, at the base of the skull, an open wound. It must have been from a beam that fell on her, the firefighter said; part of the attic had collapsed. Luc then clambered into the red vehicle where the rescuers had placed Jean-Claude, Florence's husband, the only one of the family who was still alive. His pulse was weak. He was in pyjamas, unconscious, burned yet already as cold as a corpse. Luc and Jean-Claude had been friends ever since medical school in Lyon. They'd got married almost at the same time; their children had grown up together. Each knew everything about the other's life - the public image, but also the secrets, the secrets of honest, reliable men who were all the more vulnerable to temptation. When Jean-Claude had confided in him about an affair, talked about chucking everything in, Luc had made him listen to reason. Their lives were very similar, even if they hadn't succeeded in the same way. Jean-Claude had become a leading figure in the world of medical research, hobnobbing with government ministers, always off at international conferences, while Luc was a GP in Ferney-Voltaire, a town on the French side of the Swiss border, just a few miles north of Geneva. The Romands lived in the nearby village of Pr\u00e9vessin. Later that Monday morning, Luc phoned the casualty department in Geneva: Jean-Claude, who was 38, had been placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber; the prognosis was guarded. Luc prayed with his wife C\u00e9cile and the children that he would never regain consciousness. When Luc went to his office, two policemen were waiting for him. Their questions seemed odd. They wanted to know if the Romands had any enemies, if they'd been involved in any suspicious activities... Seeing Luc's astonishment, the police told him the truth. An initial examination of the bodies revealed that the victims had died before the fire, Florence from head injuries inflicted by a blunt instrument, the children - five-year-old Antoine and seven-year-old Caroline - from bullet wounds. That wasn't all. In Clairvaux-les-Lacs, in the Jura Mountains some 50 miles to the north-west of Ferney, Jean-Claude's uncle had been delegated to break the tragic news to the injured man's parents, a frail elderly couple. Accompanied by their doctor, he had found the house locked, the dog mysteriously silent. Worried, the uncle had broken open the door to discover his brother, his sister-in-law and the dog lying in their own blood. They, too, had been shot. Murdered. The Romands had been murdered.

The receptionist did not know any Dr Romand. She connected the officer to the personnel director, who consulted his files and confirmed: there was no Dr Romand at WHO. In the course of that day, reality became even more nightmarish. Summoned to the police station in the afternoon, Luc learned that a note in Jean-Claude's handwriting confessing to the crimes had been found in his car and that everything people thought they knew about his career and professional activities was a sham. The WHO? No one there had ever heard of him. The national registry of physicians? He wasn't listed. The hospitals in Paris where he was said to be on the medical staff?

He had begun his studies, yes, but had stopped taking his exams at the end of the second year; from then on, it was all false. Latterly, Jean-Claude had confessed to Luc that he was suffering from cancer, for which he said he was being treated in Paris by the eminent oncologist L\u00e9on Schwartzenberg. Also false. Dr Schwartzenberg had no record of Jean-Claude Romand, nor had the oncology department of any other hospital in France. At first, Luc simply refused to believe this. When someone tells you that your best friend, your daughter's godfather, the most respectable man you know has killed his wife, his children, his parents, and that in addition he has been lying to you about everything for years, isn't it normal to go on believing in him, even in the face of overwhelming proof? It soon came out that Jean-Claude had an on-off relationship with a woman called Corinne Hourtin - a child psychologist, now divorced, who had once lived in Ferney with her husband R\u00e9mi. She had handed over to Jean-Claude 900,000 francs (about \u00a390,000) in savings that he was to have invested for her in Switzerland. He had embezzled it instead. Other revelations came from Florence's family, the Crolets. They, too, had entrusted money to Jean-Claude: first the father's retirement bonus, and then, after his death, a million francs netted from the sale of his house. Their grief was compounded by an agonising suspicion: M Crolet had died in a fall on a staircase when he was alone with Jean-Claude. Had he been yet another victim of his son-in-law? Everyone was wondering: how could we have lived beside this man for so long without suspecting a thing? Everyone tried to remember a moment when some suspicion had crossed their minds. Luc himself remembered that he'd been struck by something a few months earlier, after learning from Florence that Jean-Claude had ranked fifth in all of Paris in his finals. What astonished Luc wasn't this achievement but the fact that he hadn't learned of it at the time. Why hadn't Jean-Claude mentioned it? Questioned, accused of being secretive, Jean-Claude had shrugged, said he didn't want to make a big deal of it, and changed the subject. It was extraordinary, this ability to deflect conversation whenever it turned to him. Thinking back on it, you ended up admiring his discretion, his modesty, his desire to show others to advantage. Yet Luc had felt vaguely that there was something not quite right in what Jean-Claude said about his career. He'd considered calling WHO to discover exactly what it was he did there - but had decided the whole thing was absurd. And now he kept telling himself that if he'd gone through with it, maybe things would have turned out differently. \"Perhaps,\" said C\u00e9cile when he told her of his remorse, \"... perhaps he would have killed you as well.\" Three days after the fire, the Ladmirals learned that Jean-Claude was going to live. Jean-Claude Romand's early childhood was spent in a small village in the Jura where his father ran a farm. Neighbours, cousins, schoolteachers all remember a well-behaved little boy, quiet and sweet, whom some are tempted to describe as too well-behaved, too quiet, too sweet. An only child, perhaps somewhat overprotected by his mother. A child who never got up to any mischief, more respectable - if one can say that about a child - than truly lovable, but even so a child whom no one imagined to be unhappy. He says that his mother worried all the time and that he learned early on to mislead her so that she wouldn't worry even more. He admired his father for never showing his feelings and tried to imitate him. It was better to conceal them. On the one hand, he had been taught not to lie, and that was absolute dogma: a Romand was as good as his word, a Romand told the truth and shamed the Devil. On the other hand, there were certain things you shouldn't say, even if they were true. You had to avoid upsetting anyone, or boasting about your success or your good qualities. Romand achieves good grades at school. He originally plans to become a forester, but then changes his mind and decides to study medicine instead at Lyon. At the end of his second year, in 1975, he needs to resit one exam. He fails to turn up, but he tells no one, and no one notices. Three weeks went by between the day of the examination and the posting of the results. There was still time for him to admit that he had lied. It would have been hard for him, naturally. To this serious young man, it must have seemed impossibly painful to admit a whopping error, a childish blunder like that of Antoine Doinel in Les Quatre-Cent Coups, who extricates himself from a sticky situation at school by blurting out that his mother has just died, and who then must deal with the inevitable consequences of his lies and the certainty that the truth will come out. The most baffling thing, in Romand's case, is that he committed his folly in two stages, like the computer user who, having accidentally typed the command for erasing a valuable file, when asked by the program whether he's sure he wants to delete the file, carefully considers the pros and cons - then goes ahead and destroys it anyway. Rationally speaking, anything would have been better than what Jean-Claude did: he waited for the day the results were posted and then announced that he had passed, that he'd been accepted as a third-year medical student. How could he have foreseen that there was something worse than being quickly unmasked, which was not to be unmasked; how could he have suspected that this childish lie would lead him 18 years later to murder his parents, Florence, and the children he did not yet have? While still ostensibly studying medicine, Jean-Claude marries Florence Crolet, a fellow student at Lyon. He supposedly passes his medical board exam and becomes first a research assistant in a medical research institution and then a research scientist at the World Health Organisation in Geneva. Romand was always, as Florence put it, \"very compartmentalised\", strictly separating his personal and professional relations, never inviting colleagues from WHO to his house, refusing to allow himself to be disturbed at home by anyone from his office, or at work by any of his family or friends. Moreover, nobody had his office phone number, not even his wife, who contacted him through an answering service: you left a message in a voice mailbox, which sent him a signal on the bleeper he always carried with him, and then he quickly called back. Neither his wife nor anyone else found the arrangement strange. It was one of his personality traits, like his gruffness, which she often joked about: \"One of these days, I'm going to find out my husband's a communist spy.\" In the mornings, he was the one who drove the children to the Ecole Saint-Vincent. He would accompany them into the courtyard, exchange a few words with the teachers or the pupils' mothers, then drive off towards Geneva. More often than not he ended up in the car park of WHO. Entering with a visitor's badge, carrying a briefcase, he followed a familiar orbit, going from the ground-floor library to the conference rooms and the publications office, where he systematically swept up anything printed and free: his house and car overflowed with papers bearing the letterhead or stamp of WHO. He used all the services offered by the organisation - a post office where he sent his mail, a bank where he made most of his withdrawals, a travel agency through which he planned the family holidays - but did not risk going upstairs, where security guards might have asked him what he was looking for. His mother-in-law remembers that one Sunday when the whole family had gone to Switzerland, the children had wanted to see Papa's office, so Papa had agreed to the detour. They'd pulled into the car park, he'd pointed out the window. And that's all. At first he went to WHO every day, later less regularly. He'd stop at a news-stand to buy an armful of papers: dailies, magazines, scientific journals. Then he'd go and read them, either in a cafe - he was careful to change cafes often and to choose them far enough from home - or in his car. He would park in a car park or at a service station and stay there for hours, reading, taking notes, dozing. He'd have a sandwich for lunch and continue reading throughout the afternoon in a different cafe, at a different service station. Other days, he needed open air and nature, and would drive into the Jura Mountains. Lastly, there were the trips - conferences, seminars, symposiums, all over the world. He would buy a guide to the country; Florence would pack his suitcase. He'd drive off in his car, which he would supposedly leave in the long-term car park at Geneva airport. In a comfortable hotel room, often near the airport, he would take off his shoes, stretch out on the bed, spend three or four days watching television and the planes taking off and landing outside his window. He studied the guide books so he wouldn't make any mistakes in his stories when he got home. He telephoned his family every day to tell them what time it was and what the weather was like in Sao Paulo or Tokyo. He'd tell his wife, his children, his parents that he missed them, was thinking of them, sent them a big kiss. After a few days, he went home with presents bought in an airport gift shop. Everyone made a fuss of him. He was tired from jet lag. Indirectly it was WHO that provided Jean-Claude with a source of income. He said or let it be understood that as an international civil servant he was in a position to make extremely advantageous investments at a rate of 18%, an opportunity he could share with his family. Jean-Claude's parents were not the kind of people to cheat on their taxes by putting their savings into Swiss banks, but as it was their son's idea that was enough for them. Romand lived on their nest egg at the beginning of his marriage. Florence declared to the income tax authorities the very modest salary she earned by temporarily filling in for pharmacists in the area, and he declared no income because, since he worked in Switzerland, he had - he said - no taxes to pay. The year Antoine was born, Florence's father retired from his job in Annecy. A disguised redundancy, his retirement brought him a bonus of 400,000 francs. Jean-Claude agreed to do his father-in-law a favour by investing 378,000 francs for him at a Geneva bank. This sum was deposited in an account in Jean-Claude's name, since he was the one whose position entitled him to make such an investment. But one day Jean-Claude's father-in-law told him he wanted to withdraw part of his capital to buy a Mercedes. A few weeks later, on October 23, 1988, Pierre Crolet fell on the stairs of his home where he was alone with his son-in-law and died just before the arrival of the paramedics. After the fire, a new investigation was ordered at the request of the Crolet family. Of course, it uncovered nothing. At the end of the proceedings, Jean-Claude insisted on telling the Crolet family, as God was his witness, that he had had no hand in his father-in-law's death. Short of a confession on his part some day, we will never learn any more. What is indisputable is that the death of his father-in-law was providential for Romand. There was no longer any question of touching the money in the Swiss account. Then Mme Crolet decided to sell the house, now too large for her on her own, and handed over to her son-in-law the proceeds of the sale, which amounted to 1.3million francs. Romand had become enraptured with Corinne Hourtin and they begin an affair when she moves to Paris. But she soon decides that she could never love him. He confides in her, as he he did to Luc Ladmiral, that he is suffering from cancer. They remain friends, and she turns to him when she had money to invest, handing over 900,000 francs in cash. He flies from Paris with a small suitcase stuffed with notes. Soon after, Corinne decides she wants some of her money back, but finds Romand evasive. Just before the 1992 Christmas holidays, the president of the school board wanted to talk to Jean-Claude on the subject of a demoted head. The president did not know Jean-Claude well enough to be aware that one didn't call him at his office, and he had his secretary look up Jean-Claude's number in the WHO directory. Puzzled at not finding him anywhere, he imagined there must be some explanation, and he didn't think about it again until one day after the holiday when he ran into Florence in the main street of Ferney and told her about it. His tone wasn't that of a man who had suspicions but that of someone who was curious to find out the real story behind an odd mystery, and Florence reacted equally mildly. It was strange, yes, there was obviously a reason, and she'd speak to her husband about it. Florence and the man did not see each other again. One week later she was dead, and no one will ever know if she brought it up with Jean-Claude. He says she didn't. Although he was unsure where the first blow would come from, he knew that the hounds were closing in. His various bank accounts would soon be overdrawn, and he had no means of replenishing them. People were talking about him, and talking about coming after him. Hands were flipping through directories. The look in Florence's eyes had changed. He was scared. In the run-up to Christmas, he flew to Paris and took Corinne to dinner at the Restaurant Michel Rostang. Corinne told him that she had made up her mind and she wanted all of her money back. Instead of trying to wriggle out of it, he opened his diary to set up a meeting when he would hand over the funds. Turning the pages, he had an idea: he had agreed to have dinner at the start of the new year with his friend Bernard Kouchner, illustrious co-founder of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. Would Corinne like to join them? Of course Corinne would like that. Before then, though, he would be dead. On the flight home, he continued to study his diary. Christmas wasn't a good day, that would be too cruel for the children. Caroline was going to play Mary and Antoine one of the shepherds in the Nativity play at the church. So, right after New Year? Jean-Claude did not go to work on the Tuesday after the New Year. Florence and he ran errands in Ferney. She insisted that he buy a new suit; he let himself be tempted by a parka for 3,200 francs. The saleswoman thought they seemed a couple who were at leisure, well-off, and getting along fine. Jean-Claude had spent the morning studying books such as the Vidal pharmacological dictionary; he rejected drugs that caused instantaneous death in favour of barbiturates with a rapid serum peak for a comfortable lapse into unconsciousness. Everything would be ready by Friday, January 8, said the pharmacist, would that do? It would do. That evening, Romand read a story to the children. He left for Lyon on Wednesday morning. At 2.08pm he obtained 1,000 francs from the cashpoint, and another 1,000 francs at 2.45pm. Between the two withdrawals, he says, he gave a 500-franc note to a homeless person. Then, in a gun shop, he bought a stun wand, two tear gas canisters, a box of cartridges and a silencer for a .22 calibre rifle. \"So,\" the judge pointed out, \"you weren't thinking only of killing yourself. You were living with your wife and children while you were planning to kill them.\" \"That idea did surface... but it was immediately masked by other false plans, other false ideas. It was as though the idea didn't exist... I pretended... I told myself I was doing something else, that it was for a different reason, and at the same time... at the same time I was buying the bullets that would pierce my children's hearts.\" He sobbed. On the Thursday, Jean-Claude went to visit his parents in Clairvaux. The next day, after the children had gone to bed, Florence had a long phone conversation with her mother. Mme Crolet complained bitterly about being a widow, about growing old, about being neglected by her children. Her unhappiness affected Florence, who began crying after she hung up. Jean-Claude joined her on the sofa. That is the last image he has. He is sitting next to her, he has taken her in his arms, he is trying to comfort her. \"I don't remember her last words.\" He went on: \"I am unable to say what happened between the time when I was consoling Florence on the sofa and the moment I woke up holding the rolling pin stained with blood.\" Early that Saturday morning, the telephone rang, which woke the children. They were always quicker to bounce out of bed on days when they didn't have school. Jean-Claude told them that Mama was still sleeping, and the three of them went downstairs to the living room. He put a tape of The Three Little Pigs in the video, prepared bowls of Coco Pops with milk. With him in the middle, they settled themselves on the sofa to watch the cartoon while they ate their cereal. \"I knew after having killed Florence that I was also going to kill Antoine and Caroline and that those moments in front of the television were the last that we would spend together. I cuddled them. I must have said sweet things to them, like, 'I love you.' \" \"We stayed like that for perhaps an hour... Caroline saw that I was cold, she wanted to go upstairs to get my dressing gown... I said that I thought they seemed rather hot, that perhaps they had a fever and I was going to take their temperature. Caroline went upstairs with me, I had her lie down on her bed... I went to get the rifle ...\" \"What did you say to Caroline?\" asked the judge. \"I don't know any more... She'd lain down on her stomach... That's when I shot her.\" \"Go on...\" He sobbed. \"I shot Caroline the first time... She had a pillow over her head... I must have been pretending it was a game.\" Here he moaned, his eyes closed. \"I pulled the trigger... I put the rifle somewhere in the room... I called Antoine... and I did it again.\" \"Perhaps I should help you a bit, because the jury needs details and you're not being specific enough.\" \"Caroline, when she was born, it was the most wonderful day of my life... She was beautiful\" - he moaned - \"in my arms... for her first bath.\" A spasm shook his body. \"I'm the one who killed her... I'm the one who killed her.\" The policemen, appalled, held him gently by the arms. \"Don't you think Antoine could have heard the gunshots? Had you attached the silencer? Did you call him upstairs on the same pretext? To take his temperature? He didn't find that strange?\" \"I don't have an image of that precise moment. It was still them, but it couldn't be Caroline... it couldn't be Antoine...\" The prosecutor spoke up. Afterwards, he said, Romand went out to buy the local paper and a sports daily, L'Equipe, and the newspaper seller thought he looked completely normal. \"Were you trying to behave as if nothing had happened, as if life was going on as usual?\" \"I couldn't have bought L'Equipe. I never read it.\" \"Neighbours saw you cross the street to check your postbox.\" \"Did I do it to deny reality, to pretend?\" \"Why did you wrap up the rifle and carefully put it away before you left for Clairvaux?\" \"In reality, to kill them, of course, but I must have told myself that it was to return it to my father.\" Jean-Claude does not remember the drive to his parents' home later on the Saturday morning. We know the three of them had lunch together. Dishes were still on the table when Uncle Claude entered the house two days later, and the postmortem examination revealed that the stomachs of Aim\u00e9 and Anne-Marie Romand were full. Did Jean-Claude eat anything? Did his mother urge him to have something? What did they talk about? First he lured his father upstairs with the excuse of examining a malodorous air vent the old man had complained about. The old man, who couldn't bend over because of back trouble, must have knelt down to point out the defective vent, which was set into the skirting-board. That was when he received two bullets in the back. His son covered him with a wine-coloured corduroy bedspread that had been in the room since Jean-Claude's childhood. Then he went to get his mother. She hadn't heard the gunshots, fired with a silencer. He made her go into the sitting room, which they never used. She was the only one who was shot from the front. He carefully closed up the house and drove off at around two o'clock. He was heading for Paris where he was to meet Corinne. \u0095 Read the second part of the story here. \u0095 Taken from the book The Adversary by Emmanuel Carr\u00e9re and translated by Linda Coverdale to be published by Bloomsbury on 22 January 2001 at \u009514.99",

      "trailText": "<p>'The young dot.com hotshots in their 20s are now having to turn to oldies for advice on how to make their businesses work in the real world'.</p>",
      "byline": "Alexander Chancellor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The news from the world of high technology is alarming. Shares in the companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market in New York fell by 54% last year. At least 210 dot.com companies went out of business in the US, 41,000 dot.com jobs were cut, and the value of Bill Gates's shares in Microsoft fell by an estimated $40bn - more than twice the gross national product of Luxembourg. All this was reported this week in the Guardian, which said that the trend was expected not merely to continue but to accelerate this year. But the bursting of the internet bubble, frightening though it is and deeply depressing for those immediately involved, has had one positive consequence for people such as myself who have passed the age of 60. </p> <p>Until recently, we were pitied for our failing energies and mental powers. There was to be no place for us in a world dependent on high-speed innovation and business drive. The ageism that had been growing both here and in the US over the past few decades had hardened and become entrenched. But young dot.com hotshots in their 20s are now a good deal less cocksure than they used to be, as they watch their instant fortunes crumble. They have started turning to oldies for advice on how to make their businesses work in the real world. As one writer put it in the New York Times the other day, \"Suddenly maturity and experience are something to be worn in public, a silver badge of what's been gathered and gained, not just a crumpled record of what's been lost.\" </p> <p>We also have George W Bush to thank for this trend. Insecure because of his own lack of experience, he has called on the grand viziers of his father's presidential court to help him out in his daunting new role. During the Florida election nightmare, it was James Baker, the 75-year-old chief of staff in the last Bush administration, who steered him through the courts to victory. And as his vice-president he chose Dick Cheney, his father's defence secretary during the Gulf war - 60 this month and suffering from heart disease. As the former Republican senator, Alan Simpson, has put it, it is people \"with grey hair\" who must lead the country's post-election healing process (though Mr Simpson, at 67, has almost no hair at all). </p> <p>I can't say that I have noticed any greater show of deference to my grey (well, white, actually) hair in recent months, but these are reassuring developments all the same. I am no longer tempted to resort to Grecian 2000 or to cosmetic surgery, as there now seems to be a sporting chance of survival without them. The smart new thing for American internet publishers is to revert to being old-fashioned print media companies, which are businesses that oldies generally know more about than the young. The new technology is bound to dominate everything in the end, but in the short term oldies have been offered a new lease of life. </p> <p> Our purpose is not, of course, to thwart the young, but to reverse the trend towards increasing age segregation. We all need each other - whatever age we may be - and we should not be artificially compartmentalised as young, middle-aged or old. This is not to say that there isn't a certain emotional satisfaction to be found in the current tribulations of arrogant young dot.com millionaires. There is, and it would be hypocritical not to admit it.

      "bodyText": "The news from the world of high technology is alarming. Shares in the companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market in New York fell by 54% last year. At least 210 dot.com companies went out of business in the US, 41,000 dot.com jobs were cut, and the value of Bill Gates's shares in Microsoft fell by an estimated $40bn - more than twice the gross national product of Luxembourg. All this was reported this week in the Guardian, which said that the trend was expected not merely to continue but to accelerate this year. But the bursting of the internet bubble, frightening though it is and deeply depressing for those immediately involved, has had one positive consequence for people such as myself who have passed the age of 60. Until recently, we were pitied for our failing energies and mental powers. There was to be no place for us in a world dependent on high-speed innovation and business drive. The ageism that had been growing both here and in the US over the past few decades had hardened and become entrenched. But young dot.com hotshots in their 20s are now a good deal less cocksure than they used to be, as they watch their instant fortunes crumble. They have started turning to oldies for advice on how to make their businesses work in the real world. As one writer put it in the New York Times the other day, \"Suddenly maturity and experience are something to be worn in public, a silver badge of what's been gathered and gained, not just a crumpled record of what's been lost.\" We also have George W Bush to thank for this trend. Insecure because of his own lack of experience, he has called on the grand viziers of his father's presidential court to help him out in his daunting new role. During the Florida election nightmare, it was James Baker, the 75-year-old chief of staff in the last Bush administration, who steered him through the courts to victory. And as his vice-president he chose Dick Cheney, his father's defence secretary during the Gulf war - 60 this month and suffering from heart disease. As the former Republican senator, Alan Simpson, has put it, it is people \"with grey hair\" who must lead the country's post-election healing process (though Mr Simpson, at 67, has almost no hair at all). I can't say that I have noticed any greater show of deference to my grey (well, white, actually) hair in recent months, but these are reassuring developments all the same. I am no longer tempted to resort to Grecian 2000 or to cosmetic surgery, as there now seems to be a sporting chance of survival without them. The smart new thing for American internet publishers is to revert to being old-fashioned print media companies, which are businesses that oldies generally know more about than the young. The new technology is bound to dominate everything in the end, but in the short term oldies have been offered a new lease of life. Our purpose is not, of course, to thwart the young, but to reverse the trend towards increasing age segregation. We all need each other - whatever age we may be - and we should not be artificially compartmentalised as young, middle-aged or old. This is not to say that there isn't a certain emotional satisfaction to be found in the current tribulations of arrogant young dot.com millionaires. There is, and it would be hypocritical not to admit it. But the greater satisfaction for oldies is the feeling that they may be needed still. The disasters visited upon many dot.com high-flyers is of particular comfort to traditional billionaires, such as Rupert Murdoch, who found that the fortunes they spent lifetimes amassing had been overtaken in a few months by mere kids doing incomprehensible things that broke all the old economic laws. After all the grief and confusion this has caused them, they are delighted to discover that the old rules still pertain.

Only up to 1982 so far, he is already at 4m words. \"It will be 6m by the time I've finished,\" he told Sue Lawley on Desert Island Discs (Radio 4) this week. It was fun wondering what he'd got stuck at in the early 1980s, listening to his very virile weirdness. Wham! songs, perhaps? I can see \"Alexander\", as Sue fondly called him, poshing it up, entranced by them: \"Wham! Bam! I am! A man!\" Or maybe ra-ra skirts; I think he'd have liked ra-ra skirts. </p> <p>For the marquis, apart from running Longleat, Britain's second most-visited stately home (he almost hissed at a mention of Chatsworth, the most visited), has something of the saucy devil about him. On a quiet night in his \"penthouse suite\" at the house, he likes nothing better than to knock up a couple of murals for his \"Kamasutra room\" before settling down for the evening with one of his 74 \"wifelets\". Sue asked him, fondly, poshly, why he called them that. \"I felt it would be running them down to call them things like concubines, mistresses,\" he answered, thinking he sounded every inch the modern man. In fact, he just sounded like an antique, blue-blooded Stringfellow. </p> <p>It was hard not to warm to him, though. He had a way of introducing his records as if ordering a sandwich in a terribly well-to-do deli: \"I think something wonderfully rrrrrrrhythmical\"; \"Ooh, something wonderfully wild, bestial, fierce\"; \"I'd rather like some clear flute music.\" Mostly he chose stirring classical stuff - Wagner, Stravinsky and a Beethoven choral symphony that he promised would \"thoroughly arouse\" him - but his non-classical choices were the true joys. </p> <p>There was one of his own compositions, Love Words, for his long-suffering wife, Anna (which didn't mention the word wifelet, despite the many words that rhyme with it), and a children's favourite, which he referred to as Put di Lime in dee Cooking. His two or three - he seemed unsure - children love it, apparently. There may be hundreds more, he teased, but he didn't want to go into that. Mostly he sounded grumpy at his ladies' lack of productivity. </p> <p>But he got excited by his first musical choice, a thumping samba concoction that made you think of carnival, Gisele on the beach, caipirinhas cocktails. The marquis plans to let it all hang out to this song on the desert island, \"being fully alive to rrrrrhythm\". As he rolled his Rs flamboyantly once more, that image of Gisele was swiftly replaced by one of him, alabaster white, veiny and naked, limbo-dancing under a chain of wifelets, starkers except for their 74 standard-issue ra-ra skirts. It'll fade, the doctors tell me, in time. </p> <p>Compared with the marquis, the strange folk in Don Howarth's fine series of four plays, Oddballs (Radio 4), aren't very odd at all. Gently surreal and sweetly comic, these are endearing fantasies set in rural Cumbria. In last week's opener, Radio RIP, \"the People's Radio\" was caught in a maelstrom of jumble-sale announcements, radical feminist saboteurs and bomb threats, all presided over by DJ Sid Rappaport, graduate of the Alan Partridge school of broadcasting. \"Local radio isn't for listening to,\" he tells a bewildered villager. \"It's for performing on.\" It's always good to get one of life's big ponders cleared up in a half-hour drama. Next week, Stan Rooker, a hospital receptionist, has to deal with a very strange unconscious man, brought in with a knight's helmet stuck on his head. Try saying Chatsworth, Stan.

Anyone else would be a disappointment. It wouldn't be the first disappointment for those on whom Davina pounces. Maybe she should pop round to Brookside (Channel 4) and sort out Shelley. Davina could take the Sapphic scouse lover for a night on the town, far away from the allure of the Corkhill women and their blue sweatshirts. </p> <p> Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Sky One) continues its fifth season rockily. After squandering the story potential of Dracula by dispatching him in just one episode, the appearance of Dawn, Buffy's sister, remains unexplained. Buffy even says, \"It's not like Dawn didn't live in this house\", which precludes her earlier residence at Buffy's dad's place. Was the poor girl locked in a closet for the past four years?

That's something that will be welcomed by people who own a property, but probably not by those planning to buy a home this year. </p> <p>In its review of 2000 the Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender, says the price of the average UK home is now \u00a386,196 - 5.7% up on a year ago, when the figure was \u00a381,668. </p> <p>However, it may be argued this figure doesn't mean a great deal when you consider the huge variations in property prices around the country. While a typical semi-detached home in Greater London now costs \u00a3226,050, that amount of money would buy almost five similar properties in South Humberside, where the average price-tag is \u00a346,600. Aside from London, there are now 15 counties where a typical semi will set you back more than \u00a3100,000 - Surrey (\u00a3188,850) and Hertfordshire (\u00a3176,950) to Gloucestershire (\u00a3103,700) and Bedfordshire (\u00a3108,050). </p> <p>Meanwhile, those counties where the same sort of home may well cost less than \u00a360,000 include Lincolnshire (\u00a354,750), Nottinghamshire (\u00a354,650) and south Yorkshire (\u00a351,700). The Halifax says average house prices rose in all the UK regions during 2000 except for Scotland, where they fell by 4.3% to \u00a361,061, and the north of England, which suffered a 2.2% fall to \u00a355,089. </p> <p>Its figures show just how much of a rollercoaster ride the London property market went on last year.

A typical home in these two areas costs \u00a387,984 and \u00a399,491 respectively. Prices in Northern Ireland ended the year 11.2% up (typical price-tag: \u00a371,749), while there was some good news for west midlands homeowners in the form of an average 10% increase over the year (typical price: \u00a382,128). </p> <p>Yorkshire and Humberside ended the year little changed, with an annual increase of just 1.1% (\u00a356,197), while Wales saw prices rise 2.7% (\u00a363,619). Martin Ellis at the Halifax says all the evidence suggests the housing market has improved during the last few months, and the omens are pretty good for this year.

      "body": "<p>Wine drinkers who put their empties in a bottle bank or recycling box are wasting their time. It's a measure of the chaotic system we have for saving the environment - and, we hope, saving money - that every green bottle used in the UK, most of which contain wine, is dumped in a landfill site once their contents have been enjoyed. Put simply: there is no demand for green glass in the UK and shipping the stuff back to wine producing countries like France, Australia or Chile costs too much money. </p> <p>A quirk of the recycling system also means that in many areas bottle banks for brown, green and clear glass are tipped into landfill sites if people put the wrong bottles in the wrong container. None of them are recycled. Sorting out the rogue bottles in large bottle banks is not cost effective, say firms that collect rubbish for recycling. There have also been reports of recycling companies dropping newspapers and other waste collected into landfill sites when the price paid for recycled products drops or the capacity to produce goods with recycled materials reaches capacity. </p> <p>The government wants more people to stop throwing rubbish away and to save energy. But what is it doing, four years after coming to power, to turn into reality the commitments it has made to cut the amount of greenhouse gas emissions? </p> <p>While much is being done to persuade businesses that cutting emissions can be financially advantageous, little is being done to shift the majority of households over to using energy-saving products like condenser boilers, cars that run on gas and solar panels. </p> <p>This week a Labour-dominated parliamentary committee said the government had \"a long way to go to satisfy the expectations it has raised on the environment and sustainable development\". The committee wants an environmental auditor to oversee the government's work and check on its claims that tangible improvements have taken place. </p> <p>For instance, John Prescott's department of the environment, transport and the regions says it inherited 4m households that could not properly heat their homes. In response, it has brought in many 100% grants targeting people on benefits. The number of people with cold houses has been cut to 3m, it insists - though it cannot say if these households have saved energy using cavity wall insulation, loft insulation or more modern controls on their boilers. </p> <p>The problem for the government is that households, which account for 44% of all carbon dioxide emissions, are guzzling more gas and electricity every year. The electronic revolution, supported by Tony Blair, is all about having a myriad of electronic appliances on standby, ready to do your bidding at the touch of a remote control, keyboard, or mobile phone handset. General affluence and rising benefit levels are also likely to make matters worse. So the government needs to offer substantial grants, subsidies and tax breaks to minimise the rise in energy use, let alone cut it back to help the planet. </p> <p>California, some way ahead of us in the e-revolution, has seen its electricity system collapse under the strain. Power cuts are a regular occurrence and power companies have begun to raise the cost of electricity dramatically to drive down demand. </p> <p>According to a survey for the Co-op Bank this week, the government also has an uphill struggle persuading young homeowners to buy energy saving products and services. The under-25s, once the most environmentally concerned generation, are almost the least concerned today. The survey found that 25% of under-25s and under-35s \"are not concerned about the environment at all\". Only 9% of the younger group were very concerned. </p> <p>A government survey published last October found that only 3% consider the environmental impact of an appliance as the most important consideration when shopping, and only 8% considered its energy efficiency to be the key factor. </p> <p>The main government agency pushing energy efficiency is the Energy Savings Trust. It publicises handy tips for saving energy and will inform callers or visitors to its website which grants are available - something that varies widely from one area to another. Some of the grants are offered by local councils, others by gas and electricity suppliers. Utilities suppliers are forced to devise energy-saving schemes by the government's Easop scheme. Among other things, it demands that suppliers spend \u00a31.20 per customer on emission saving schemes. </p> <p>Northern Electric, which operates mainly in the north-east and has 2m customers, offers 40% off cavity wall and loft insulation unless applicants are on benefits, in which case the discount is 100%. It also offers discounts of between \u00a320 and \u00a360 on A-rated fridges, freezers and fridge/freezers in its 45 shops. The scheme is open to anyone, but is only marketed to existing customers. </p> <p>British Gas prefers to promote savings of up to \u00a3570 on the installation of a condenser boiler. The boiler has a second fan that recycles heat that would other wise be expelled by the machine. </p> <p>Until early last year there was a government scheme that gave \u00a3200 cash back on the purchase of a condenser boiler, but the fund ran dry and some utility companies have picked up the baton. A British Gas offer can give more in cash terms than the government scheme, but you must choose your machine from a range supplied by British Gas and use the company's installers. </p> <p>Some councils have taken the issue seriously. The new city of Brighton and Hove and its neighbours in East Sussex complement the obligatory cavity and loft insulation offers with discounts on solar panel installation totalling \u00a3250, which sounds great until you find out from Enact, the agency set up to handle in quiries, that installing one panel can cost up to \u00a32,500. </p> <p>Privately owned cars are also a target. Sales of small cars jumped by over 100,000 last year following the move to cut vehicle excise duty on anything with an engine size under 1100cc (from next year 1200cc cars will be included). Car industry experts reckon the jump had more to do with the arrival of features like ABS brakes and airbags which until recently were the preserve of executive cars, though the tax cut must have helped. </p> <p>Government attempts to switch cars over to liquid gas (LPG) from petrol is more limited. The Energy Savings Trust has been given \u00a35m pounds to kick-start the changeover and readily confesses that private households are not really in the picture. Only owners of cars which are less than 12 months old receive a grant, which means that the trust mainly talks to fleet car managers about switching their new cars. </p> <p>Critics say the government has a long way to go before it begins to make an impact on individual consumers. Environmental groups argue that more of Gordon Brown's tax receipts from petrol consumption should be directed into green energy such as burning waste and wind power. It should also subsidise markets for recycled goods to promote their use. </p> <p>John Prescott's team say they are looking into it, but four years after Labour took power and they seem no nearer getting large numbers of people to switch over. </p> <p><strong> How you can cut use and save money</strong></p> <p>The government is keen that we should all fill our kettles with less water and switch off the standby buttons on our televisions to save energy. But there are more fundamental ways of cutting the amount of power used by your household and many of them will save you money as well as cutting greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>There are many gas and electric companies that offer green energy. Unfortunately not all the biggest suppliers, like British Gas, have got round to offering it and the rest don't publicise their green tariffs. Probably the best offer comes from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). It has teamed up with Scottish and Southern Energy, which it says supplies over 40% of renewable energy in the UK. It says customers can save up to \u00a350 per year and guarantees not to cost more than your current tariff. </p> <p>Green mortgages also promise to support renewable energy projects, tree planting and other schemes to support the environment. Norwich &amp; Peterborough, the Ecology building society and Triodos Bank are the front runners in this market and say customers can save money when they embark on energy saving projects in the home. Ethical investments from the likes of Friends Provident, Norwich Union and Henderson Investors, will also single out environmental issues, but as yet cannot claim to consistently beat investments that ignore environmental concerns. </p> <p>Solar panels have been around for decades. Few homes have them and, unlike America, there are no housebuilders that include them in new buildings as a matter of course. The Dutch government has just told housebuilders they must include solar panels in 50% of their new homes. </p> <p>The UK government has cut the VAT on energy-saving materials, which can add up to a saving of \u00a3310 on a typical \u00a31,800 to \u00a32,500 solar panel installation cost. If you live in Brighton or another part of East Sussex the local councils have got together to offer another \u00a3250 against the cost. Savings can be \u00a350 per year on electricity bills. Enact is the agency issuing the grants. </p> <p>Anyone on benefits can claim up to 100% off loft and cavity wall insulation, draught excluders and new controls for a central heating boiler. Grants of up to \u00a32,000 can be claimed by benefit claimants in total. The average saving for householders not claiming benefits is 40%. </p> <p>If you use gas rather than electricity for heating, then a condenser boiler is considered to be the best way to save money and support the environment. They can cost up to \u00a3575 more than a standard boiler. British Gas will wipe out the difference, but only if you commission them rather than a local gas expert to install the system. You don't need to be a British Gas customer. </p> <p>If this offer fails to attract, London Electricity offers \u00a3125 discount on a new condenser boiler. Similar offers are provided by other suppliers. </p> <p>Switching to an environmentally friendly car could mean switching to a smaller one and enjoying cuts in excise duty of over \u00a350, but big savings can be made if your car runs on gas (natural or LPG). LPG is 40p per litre, almost half the cost of unleaded petrol and only a little less efficient. Not many petrol stations stock the stuff, but as soon as one near you adds an LPG pump it becomes possible. The average cost of conversion is \u00a31,500 and up to 75% of the cost can be claimed back. But the car must be less than one year old, have done fewer than 25,000 miles and appear on a list of cars elegible for the change. </p> <p>The Energy Saving Trust recommends that individuals reject this route and instead hunt around for ex-fleet cars that have been converted. Vauxhall has made sure many of its models can be adapted, and its chain of secondhand shops, Network Q, should be a good place to find a new economical, environmentally friendly car. </p> <p>In the north-east, North ern Electric is offering discounts on A-rated fridges, freezers, fridge/freezers and condenser boilers. The fridges must be purchased through its shops, where a \u00a365 discount is possible from an A-rated fridge/freezer. </p> <p>It tops the London Electricity offer on condenser boilers with a discount of \u00a3150.

      "bodyText": "Wine drinkers who put their empties in a bottle bank or recycling box are wasting their time. It's a measure of the chaotic system we have for saving the environment - and, we hope, saving money - that every green bottle used in the UK, most of which contain wine, is dumped in a landfill site once their contents have been enjoyed. Put simply: there is no demand for green glass in the UK and shipping the stuff back to wine producing countries like France, Australia or Chile costs too much money. A quirk of the recycling system also means that in many areas bottle banks for brown, green and clear glass are tipped into landfill sites if people put the wrong bottles in the wrong container. None of them are recycled. Sorting out the rogue bottles in large bottle banks is not cost effective, say firms that collect rubbish for recycling. There have also been reports of recycling companies dropping newspapers and other waste collected into landfill sites when the price paid for recycled products drops or the capacity to produce goods with recycled materials reaches capacity. The government wants more people to stop throwing rubbish away and to save energy. But what is it doing, four years after coming to power, to turn into reality the commitments it has made to cut the amount of greenhouse gas emissions? While much is being done to persuade businesses that cutting emissions can be financially advantageous, little is being done to shift the majority of households over to using energy-saving products like condenser boilers, cars that run on gas and solar panels. This week a Labour-dominated parliamentary committee said the government had \"a long way to go to satisfy the expectations it has raised on the environment and sustainable development\". The committee wants an environmental auditor to oversee the government's work and check on its claims that tangible improvements have taken place. For instance, John Prescott's department of the environment, transport and the regions says it inherited 4m households that could not properly heat their homes. In response, it has brought in many 100% grants targeting people on benefits. The number of people with cold houses has been cut to 3m, it insists - though it cannot say if these households have saved energy using cavity wall insulation, loft insulation or more modern controls on their boilers. The problem for the government is that households, which account for 44% of all carbon dioxide emissions, are guzzling more gas and electricity every year. The electronic revolution, supported by Tony Blair, is all about having a myriad of electronic appliances on standby, ready to do your bidding at the touch of a remote control, keyboard, or mobile phone handset. General affluence and rising benefit levels are also likely to make matters worse. So the government needs to offer substantial grants, subsidies and tax breaks to minimise the rise in energy use, let alone cut it back to help the planet. California, some way ahead of us in the e-revolution, has seen its electricity system collapse under the strain. Power cuts are a regular occurrence and power companies have begun to raise the cost of electricity dramatically to drive down demand. According to a survey for the Co-op Bank this week, the government also has an uphill struggle persuading young homeowners to buy energy saving products and services. The under-25s, once the most environmentally concerned generation, are almost the least concerned today. The survey found that 25% of under-25s and under-35s \"are not concerned about the environment at all\". Only 9% of the younger group were very concerned. A government survey published last October found that only 3% consider the environmental impact of an appliance as the most important consideration when shopping, and only 8% considered its energy efficiency to be the key factor. The main government agency pushing energy efficiency is the Energy Savings Trust. It publicises handy tips for saving energy and will inform callers or visitors to its website which grants are available - something that varies widely from one area to another. Some of the grants are offered by local councils, others by gas and electricity suppliers. Utilities suppliers are forced to devise energy-saving schemes by the government's Easop scheme. Among other things, it demands that suppliers spend \u00a31.20 per customer on emission saving schemes. Northern Electric, which operates mainly in the north-east and has 2m customers, offers 40% off cavity wall and loft insulation unless applicants are on benefits, in which case the discount is 100%. It also offers discounts of between \u00a320 and \u00a360 on A-rated fridges, freezers and fridge/freezers in its 45 shops. The scheme is open to anyone, but is only marketed to existing customers. British Gas prefers to promote savings of up to \u00a3570 on the installation of a condenser boiler. The boiler has a second fan that recycles heat that would other wise be expelled by the machine. Until early last year there was a government scheme that gave \u00a3200 cash back on the purchase of a condenser boiler, but the fund ran dry and some utility companies have picked up the baton. A British Gas offer can give more in cash terms than the government scheme, but you must choose your machine from a range supplied by British Gas and use the company's installers. Some councils have taken the issue seriously. The new city of Brighton and Hove and its neighbours in East Sussex complement the obligatory cavity and loft insulation offers with discounts on solar panel installation totalling \u00a3250, which sounds great until you find out from Enact, the agency set up to handle in quiries, that installing one panel can cost up to \u00a32,500. Privately owned cars are also a target. Sales of small cars jumped by over 100,000 last year following the move to cut vehicle excise duty on anything with an engine size under 1100cc (from next year 1200cc cars will be included). Car industry experts reckon the jump had more to do with the arrival of features like ABS brakes and airbags which until recently were the preserve of executive cars, though the tax cut must have helped. Government attempts to switch cars over to liquid gas (LPG) from petrol is more limited. The Energy Savings Trust has been given \u00a35m pounds to kick-start the changeover and readily confesses that private households are not really in the picture. Only owners of cars which are less than 12 months old receive a grant, which means that the trust mainly talks to fleet car managers about switching their new cars. Critics say the government has a long way to go before it begins to make an impact on individual consumers. Environmental groups argue that more of Gordon Brown's tax receipts from petrol consumption should be directed into green energy such as burning waste and wind power. It should also subsidise markets for recycled goods to promote their use. John Prescott's team say they are looking into it, but four years after Labour took power and they seem no nearer getting large numbers of people to switch over. How you can cut use and save money The government is keen that we should all fill our kettles with less water and switch off the standby buttons on our televisions to save energy. But there are more fundamental ways of cutting the amount of power used by your household and many of them will save you money as well as cutting greenhouse gas emissions. There are many gas and electric companies that offer green energy. Unfortunately not all the biggest suppliers, like British Gas, have got round to offering it and the rest don't publicise their green tariffs. Probably the best offer comes from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). It has teamed up with Scottish and Southern Energy, which it says supplies over 40% of renewable energy in the UK. It says customers can save up to \u00a350 per year and guarantees not to cost more than your current tariff. Green mortgages also promise to support renewable energy projects, tree planting and other schemes to support the environment. Norwich &amp; Peterborough, the Ecology building society and Triodos Bank are the front runners in this market and say customers can save money when they embark on energy saving projects in the home. Ethical investments from the likes of Friends Provident, Norwich Union and Henderson Investors, will also single out environmental issues, but as yet cannot claim to consistently beat investments that ignore environmental concerns. Solar panels have been around for decades. Few homes have them and, unlike America, there are no housebuilders that include them in new buildings as a matter of course. The Dutch government has just told housebuilders they must include solar panels in 50% of their new homes. The UK government has cut the VAT on energy-saving materials, which can add up to a saving of \u00a3310 on a typical \u00a31,800 to \u00a32,500 solar panel installation cost. If you live in Brighton or another part of East Sussex the local councils have got together to offer another \u00a3250 against the cost. Savings can be \u00a350 per year on electricity bills. Enact is the agency issuing the grants. Anyone on benefits can claim up to 100% off loft and cavity wall insulation, draught excluders and new controls for a central heating boiler. Grants of up to \u00a32,000 can be claimed by benefit claimants in total. The average saving for householders not claiming benefits is 40%. If you use gas rather than electricity for heating, then a condenser boiler is considered to be the best way to save money and support the environment. They can cost up to \u00a3575 more than a standard boiler. British Gas will wipe out the difference, but only if you commission them rather than a local gas expert to install the system. You don't need to be a British Gas customer. If this offer fails to attract, London Electricity offers \u00a3125 discount on a new condenser boiler. Similar offers are provided by other suppliers. Switching to an environmentally friendly car could mean switching to a smaller one and enjoying cuts in excise duty of over \u00a350, but big savings can be made if your car runs on gas (natural or LPG). LPG is 40p per litre, almost half the cost of unleaded petrol and only a little less efficient. Not many petrol stations stock the stuff, but as soon as one near you adds an LPG pump it becomes possible. The average cost of conversion is \u00a31,500 and up to 75% of the cost can be claimed back. But the car must be less than one year old, have done fewer than 25,000 miles and appear on a list of cars elegible for the change. The Energy Saving Trust recommends that individuals reject this route and instead hunt around for ex-fleet cars that have been converted. Vauxhall has made sure many of its models can be adapted, and its chain of secondhand shops, Network Q, should be a good place to find a new economical, environmentally friendly car. In the north-east, North ern Electric is offering discounts on A-rated fridges, freezers, fridge/freezers and condenser boilers. The fridges must be purchased through its shops, where a \u00a365 discount is possible from an A-rated fridge/freezer. It tops the London Electricity offer on condenser boilers with a discount of \u00a3150. Like London Electricity, the company only publicises the offer to its own customers, but the boiler offer is open to any gas user.",

Callers will get a free 34-page guide to the options they face and can order any of seven other guides, including occupational pensions, pensions for women, for the self-employed, contracted-out and stakeholder pensions. </p> <p><strong>What you need to know</strong></p> <p><strong> What is a stakeholder pension?</strong> </p> <p>Stakeholders are cheap and simple pension plans with government-imposed maximum charges and minimum standards. They go on sale on April 6, with charges capped at 1% per annum and no initial charges. You can make payments from just \u00a320 per month and stop and start them at will. You can transfer between providers at no cost. </p> <p><strong> Are they a better deal than personal pensions?</strong> </p> <p>You bet. Personal pensions had initial charges of 5-10% plus annual charges of 1-3%, enough to pay big commissions to salesmen and big profits for providers. </p> <p><strong> Should I take one out?</strong> </p> <p>Only if your employer does not already offer a company pension. Stakeholders are aimed at the 40% of workers who earn between \u00a310,000-\u00a320,000 a year but because they are on contract or self-employed, or work in small companies, are not offered a company scheme. </p> <p><strong> Why don't I buy an ISA or invest in property instead for my retirement?</strong> </p> <p>Because of the tax relief on stakeholder pensions. You can make payments of up to \u00a33,600 a year (\u00a3300 per month) into a stakeholder and earn full tax relief on all the money. This means the government is giving you a 22% or 40% bonus depending on your tax band. </p> <p><strong> Do I have to be in work to take one out?</strong> </p> <p>No. One of the big innovations in stakeholder is that you can earn tax relief on the money you put in even if you are not working. This means that for the first time people without employment will be able to contribute to a pension and obtain tax relief. </p> <p><strong> I already have a company pension. Should I switch to a stakeholder?</strong> </p> <p>Almost certainly not. The contributions that an employer makes into your pension far outweigh any benefits that an individual stakeholder pension will give you. </p> <p><strong> I already have a personal pension. Should I switch to a stakeholder?</strong> </p> <p>You should look into doing so; stakeholders are cheaper and more flexible than personal pensions. Your decision should rest on the size of exit penalty you might face and the length of time you have contributed to a personal pension. The longer you have saved, the less worthwhile it will be to switch. </p> <p><strong> If my employer offers a stakeholder, should I take it? </strong></p> <p> It depends on whether your employer is offering to pay any contributions into the plan. Above all, oppose any move by your employer to close down its company pension scheme and offer a stakeholder instead. </p> <p><strong> Will I still get the state pension?</strong> </p> <p>Yes. The aim of stakeholder is to give a top-up pension to people on low incomes. </p> <p><strong> Will I pay tax on the income from my stakeholder pension, and will it hit my benefits?</strong> </p> <p>Yes and yes. The income from your stakeholder will be treated like any other income (and any other pension) and will be taxable. A much thornier issue is the benefits problem. For poorer people, the income earned from the stakeholder pension may simply mean that other income, such as housing benefit, will be reduced pound-for-pound. </p> <p><strong> Will all stakeholder pensions be the same?</strong> </p> <p>Not quite. The rules mean they all charge under 1% a year, but the final pension pot you receive will depend on how successful they are at investing your money. </p>",

What you need to know What is a stakeholder pension? Stakeholders are cheap and simple pension plans with government-imposed maximum charges and minimum standards. They go on sale on April 6, with charges capped at 1% per annum and no initial charges. You can make payments from just \u00a320 per month and stop and start them at will. You can transfer between providers at no cost. Are they a better deal than personal pensions? You bet. Personal pensions had initial charges of 5-10% plus annual charges of 1-3%, enough to pay big commissions to salesmen and big profits for providers. Should I take one out? Only if your employer does not already offer a company pension. Stakeholders are aimed at the 40% of workers who earn between \u00a310,000-\u00a320,000 a year but because they are on contract or self-employed, or work in small companies, are not offered a company scheme. Why don't I buy an ISA or invest in property instead for my retirement? Because of the tax relief on stakeholder pensions. You can make payments of up to \u00a33,600 a year (\u00a3300 per month) into a stakeholder and earn full tax relief on all the money. This means the government is giving you a 22% or 40% bonus depending on your tax band. Do I have to be in work to take one out? No. One of the big innovations in stakeholder is that you can earn tax relief on the money you put in even if you are not working. This means that for the first time people without employment will be able to contribute to a pension and obtain tax relief. I already have a company pension. Should I switch to a stakeholder? Almost certainly not. The contributions that an employer makes into your pension far outweigh any benefits that an individual stakeholder pension will give you. I already have a personal pension. Should I switch to a stakeholder? You should look into doing so; stakeholders are cheaper and more flexible than personal pensions. Your decision should rest on the size of exit penalty you might face and the length of time you have contributed to a personal pension. The longer you have saved, the less worthwhile it will be to switch. If my employer offers a stakeholder, should I take it? It depends on whether your employer is offering to pay any contributions into the plan. Above all, oppose any move by your employer to close down its company pension scheme and offer a stakeholder instead. Will I still get the state pension? Yes. The aim of stakeholder is to give a top-up pension to people on low incomes. Will I pay tax on the income from my stakeholder pension, and will it hit my benefits? Yes and yes. The income from your stakeholder will be treated like any other income (and any other pension) and will be taxable. A much thornier issue is the benefits problem. For poorer people, the income earned from the stakeholder pension may simply mean that other income, such as housing benefit, will be reduced pound-for-pound. Will all stakeholder pensions be the same? Not quite. The rules mean they all charge under 1% a year, but the final pension pot you receive will depend on how successful they are at investing your money.",

      "body": "<p>A frantic round of meetings and talks this week raised hopes that a solution to the Equitable Life crisis might just be in sight, so the message to policyholders is: sit tight and think very, very carefully before pulling out any of your money. </p> <p>Last-ditch proposals that could help to secure a brighter future for the troubled insurer gathered momentum this week. It emerged that a deal may be struck to plug the so-called black hole in its finances, and also that discussions are proceeding apace about the sale of parts or even the whole of the business. </p> <p>If either or both come to fruition, this could improve the fortunes of the 1m with-profits policyholders, who have been warned they will face lower investment returns in future, yet will be hit with a 10% penalty if they have the temerity to transfer their funds to another company. </p> <p>An action group representing some of the people with so-called guaranteed annuities has indicated they may be willing to cut their losses and go for a compromise. The Equitable Life Guaranteed Annuity Rate Action Group - whose members brought the court case that led to the company's current predicament - met with Equitable this week and put forward proposals aimed at setting a maximum limit on the cost of meeting the guarantees. </p> <p>At the moment there doesn't seem to be anything stopping these costs spiralling upwards and hitting several billion pounds, and it is this uncertainty that frightened off the companies that considered buying Equitable late last year. The failure to find a buyer, combined with a House of Lords ruling that Equitable must meet the guarantees in full, led to the company shutting its doors to new business and imposing tough new conditions on its policyholders. Precise details of the deal have been kept under wraps, but it is understood the action group is suggesting that Equitable gives the 90,000 people with guaranteed annuities a one-off payment into their fund. In return for this, they would give up their rights to full payouts. The action group is thought unlikely to accept a total payout of less than \u00a31.5bn. </p> <p>Equitable is now giving this proposal a lot of thought and, while there has been speculation that a deal might be imminent, the company says it is a complicated issue and a lot of work still needs to be done. \"We have got 90,000 people, all of whom have individual contracts. In practical terms it's not simple.\" </p> <p>If a deal is struck, it would almost certainly have to be voted on by all the company's policyholders at a special meeting, and it would require the approval of a majority of members. In other words, there is some way to go before any deal of this sort could be put into practice. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the company said on Thursday that it hopes to announce the sale of part(s) or possibly all of the business by the end of this month.

      "bodyText": "A frantic round of meetings and talks this week raised hopes that a solution to the Equitable Life crisis might just be in sight, so the message to policyholders is: sit tight and think very, very carefully before pulling out any of your money. Last-ditch proposals that could help to secure a brighter future for the troubled insurer gathered momentum this week. It emerged that a deal may be struck to plug the so-called black hole in its finances, and also that discussions are proceeding apace about the sale of parts or even the whole of the business. If either or both come to fruition, this could improve the fortunes of the 1m with-profits policyholders, who have been warned they will face lower investment returns in future, yet will be hit with a 10% penalty if they have the temerity to transfer their funds to another company. An action group representing some of the people with so-called guaranteed annuities has indicated they may be willing to cut their losses and go for a compromise. The Equitable Life Guaranteed Annuity Rate Action Group - whose members brought the court case that led to the company's current predicament - met with Equitable this week and put forward proposals aimed at setting a maximum limit on the cost of meeting the guarantees. At the moment there doesn't seem to be anything stopping these costs spiralling upwards and hitting several billion pounds, and it is this uncertainty that frightened off the companies that considered buying Equitable late last year. The failure to find a buyer, combined with a House of Lords ruling that Equitable must meet the guarantees in full, led to the company shutting its doors to new business and imposing tough new conditions on its policyholders. Precise details of the deal have been kept under wraps, but it is understood the action group is suggesting that Equitable gives the 90,000 people with guaranteed annuities a one-off payment into their fund. In return for this, they would give up their rights to full payouts. The action group is thought unlikely to accept a total payout of less than \u00a31.5bn. Equitable is now giving this proposal a lot of thought and, while there has been speculation that a deal might be imminent, the company says it is a complicated issue and a lot of work still needs to be done. \"We have got 90,000 people, all of whom have individual contracts. In practical terms it's not simple.\" If a deal is struck, it would almost certainly have to be voted on by all the company's policyholders at a special meeting, and it would require the approval of a majority of members. In other words, there is some way to go before any deal of this sort could be put into practice. Meanwhile, the company said on Thursday that it hopes to announce the sale of part(s) or possibly all of the business by the end of this month. It said it was in talks with several companies which should lead to offers being made for the various parts of its business, either \"as a whole or separately\". These words raised hopes that the sale of the company as a going concern was still a possibility. Many people would argue this would be the best news of all for the with-profits policyholders as it would put much more money in the kitty for delivering better investment returns in future, and might mean the company is able to reduce or even scrap the 10% penalty for withdrawing your money. While policyholders might well want to stop making new contributions to an Equitable policy, the best advice would appear to be to keep any money already paid in where it is while we wait and see how things develop. You'll kick yourself if you paid the 10% penalty for withdrawing your funds and then this charge is reduced or abolished in a few weeks' time. Looking on the bleak side, however, Equitable could decide to increase the penalty further to prevent a mass exodus of policyholders if things goes pear-shaped.",

At the same time it will set up a charity, the Halifax Foundation, and plans to use money raised from the sale to fund a \u00a33m-a-year programme for good causes. </p> <p>It's not too late to claim Halifax shares if you think you're owed some, but you'll need to get your skates on. Claims must be received by the bank by April 7. After that date you won't be able to get your shares, but you will still be entitled to receive the sale proceeds together with any dividends that would have been paid prior to the sale. </p> <p>This \u00a3170m represents just a tiny proportion of the multi-billion pound mountain of forgotten loot just waiting to be claimed by its rightful owners. Here we look at what you should do if you think you're owed a windfall by one of the building societies that converted in the last few years, or if you're wondering whether you may have unknowingly won a premium bond prize. </p> <p>Around 7.6m people shared in the jackpot when the Halifax made its stock market splash in June 1997, but around 145,000 of them have never come forward. In most cases it is thought these people have moved home without informing the Halifax of their new address, and may have forgotten about the shares they were allocated. The Halifax says it also can't rule out the possibility that a very small number of people may have deliberately not claimed their shares because they were vehemently opposed to it abandoning building society status. </p> <p>The average Halifax handout awaiting collection by its owner is worth \u00a31,500. Harry Baines, company secretary, says: \"There has been a great deal of publicity over the past three years about the Halifax's conversion but the message still does not seem to have reached all those entitled to shares.\" </p> <p>A dedicated customer helpline has been set up by the Halifax to handle enquiries about unclaimed shares: call 0870 240 0717, 9am-5pm Mon-Fri. To qualify for shares, a saver must have been the sole or first-named joint holder of a qualifying account which must have been continuously in credit between November 25, 1994 and June 2, 1997, and must have contained at least \u00a3100 on the first of these two dates and December 31, 1996. Similar rules apply to mortgage-holders. </p> <p>The other three building societies which converted into banks in 1997 also have thousands of former members who still haven't come forward to collect what's rightfully theirs: </p> <p><strong> Alliance &amp; Leicester</strong> has 68,000 missing shareholders who between them are owed around \u00a3106m. A&amp;L sold their shares on September 27 last year, and if you think you're due a windfall you can claim the proceeds - a tidy \u00a31,560 each, including dividends - by writing in, giving as much information as possible, to: Shareholder Services, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Carlton Park, Narborough, Leicester LE9 5XX. </p> <p><strong> The Woolwich</strong> , which has been bought by Barclays, sold 21m unclaimed shares worth more than \u00a350m on October 11 last year. This money has now been ring-fenced and if you're one of the 38,400 people entitled to a payout you should call the Barclays shareholder line on 0870 702 0196. </p> <p><strong> Northern Rock</strong> seems to have been more successful than the others in tracing its lost shareholders. Of the 885,000 people who qualified for free shares following its October 1997 flotation, only 5,000 have still not come for ward to claim their entitlement. It placed adverts in the papers towards the end of last year informing people it intended to sell these shares, possibly this year. If you think you're owed a windfall, you must get your claim in by the end of this month - otherwise, you'll only be able to claim the cash. Call its shareholder relations helpline on 0191 279 4877. </p> <p>Bradford &amp; Bingley floated on the stock market on December 4, resulting in windfalls for just under 2.7m people. B&amp;B says that fewer than 5% of the eligible former members have yet to claim their free shares. If you're one of them, ring Computershare Services (the firm handling the share issue) on 0870 703 003 and ask for a B&amp;B shares claim pack. </p> <p>Meanwhile <strong> National Savings </strong> has millions of pounds worth of unclaimed premium bond prizes sitting in its vaults, and there is quite a bit more cash languishing in savings accounts that have not been touched for years. </p> <p>While 99.5% of premium bond winners have been traced, one in every 200 prizes won is never collected and there are currently 324,000 unclaimed prizes worth \u00a319.2m. </p> <p>The largest outstanding prize is \u00a325,000, which National Savings reckons belongs to someone who has since moved to Canada. \"Despite persistent efforts, we have so far been unable to trace this winner,\" it says. \"We contacted the British Embassy in Canada. They put out notices in Canada saying this money was outstanding.\" There are also two \u00a310,000 unclaimed prizes and 18 \u00a35,000 prizes. </p> <p>Unlike the National Lottery, there is no time limit on claiming your prize. There are three ways of checking if you're owed anything. You can write to: Premium Bonds, National Savings, Blackpool FY3 9YP, and it will make a free check. Or log on to the <a href=\"wwwnationalsavings.co.uk\"> website</a>, which has a database of unclaimed prizes. You will need to key in your holder's number. </p> <p>Alternatively, check the annual supplement to the London Gazette, available at main post offices, which lists all the unclaimed prizes. </p> <p>There are companies out there which will check to see if you are due an unclaimed payout from a financial services company, but you usually have to pay a fee. One which may be worth a look is the unclaimed assets register, run by insurance broker Aon (<a href=\"http://www.uar.co.uk\">www.uar.co.uk</a> tel 0870 241 1713).</p>",
