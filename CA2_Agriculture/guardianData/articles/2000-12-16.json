      "body": "<p>Aston Villa's unwanted reputation as the club football's big names would rather leave than join was further embroidered yesterday when their goalkeeper David James submitted an official transfer request. </p> <p>The England international's simmering, long-term disagreement with the midlands club reached an unpleasant but predictable climax when he announced he had no intention of accepting Villa's offer of a new contract and wished to leave. </p> <p>The former Watford and Liverpool player is adamant his decision is in no way financially motivated but due simply to Villa not matching his vision. \"For me, money is not the main concern, \" said James. \"It is all about the direction this club is heading in. I need to be satisfied that the club harbours the same ambitions as I do.\" Villa's captain Gareth Southgate cited almost identical reasons when he asked for a transfer last summer. </p> <p>John Gregory, the Villa manager, offered James a new, 3-year deal last month which would have given him financial parity with the club's top earners, Paul Merson and Dion Dublin. </p> <p>James's decision will strengthen the resolve of those Villa supporters who have been campaigning for sweeping boardroom changes, believing the club is no longer capable of launching a realistic challenge to the Premiership's elite. </p> <p>Recently some Villa fans - a minority but a vociferous minority - has been demanding that the long-serving chairman Doug Ellis hand over the corporate chequebook to Gregory or stand down. It seems he is reluctant to do either. </p> <p>If James departs he will follow a well-trodden path marked by such as Dwight Yorke, Stan Collymore, Benito Carbone and Steve Watson. </p> <p>Although James recently won an international recall after three years, playing in the friendly in Italy, it is unclear where his next port of call will be if he carries out his threat to leave Villa Park. </p> <p>The only leading Premiership club apparently actively seeking a new goalkeeper are Arsenal. But it is debatable whether Ars\u00e8ne Wenger would invest in a player who may well have lived down the nickname of \"Calamity James\" but who is still prone to lapses in concentration and inconsistency. </p> <p>James's seeming inability to learn from countless mistakes ended his Liverpool career, G\u00e9rard Houllier offloading him to Villa 18 months ago for \u00a31.7m. </p> <p>Now, of James's desire to leave Villa, Ian Robathan, chairman of the Independent Supporters' Association, said: \"I'm not shocked by this - I'm not even surprised. We now have two of our senior players wanting away because they say the club lacks ambition. </p> <p>\"David James can see he isn't going to win things at Villa. We are not challenging for things and this has finally hit home with the players. We are now bracketed with Leicester and Tottenham when we want to be bracketed with Manchester United and Arsenal.\" </p> <p>The hunt for Robbie Keane intensified yesterday when Chelsea agreed a \u00a312m fee with Internazionale for the Republic of Ireland striker. </p> <p>But Chelsea are understood not to be confident about landing the 20-year-old because he would prefer to stay in Italy to prove himself after joining Inter only in August for \u00a312m. </p> <p>Keane said last night: \"I've got a contract [with Inter] for five years and as far as I'm concerned I'm staying here. I'm very happy here at the moment. I just want to get myself back fit and hopefully work myself back into the team.\" </p> <p>However, now Inter admit they are ready to sell, he must decide whether a return to the Premiership would be wiser. </p> <p>Although Keane has a choice of Premiership clubs if he does come back - West Ham failed with a \u00a310m offer on Thursday - the player would prefer Leeds. However, it is believed Inter want the Leeds midfielder Olivier Dacourt as part of the deal and David O'Leary is unwilling to approve that move. </p> <p>Another option is for Keane to go on loan until the end of the season to another Serie A club, with Napoli the most likely. </p> <p>All Chelsea's managing director Colin Hutchinson would say about the projected deal yesterday was: \"We have had discussions with Inter Milan about Robbie Keane.\" </p> <p>At least Chelsea's offer shows they are determined to reinvest the \u00a312m they received from Rangers for Tore Andre Flo. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

It seems he is reluctant to do either. If James departs he will follow a well-trodden path marked by such as Dwight Yorke, Stan Collymore, Benito Carbone and Steve Watson. Although James recently won an international recall after three years, playing in the friendly in Italy, it is unclear where his next port of call will be if he carries out his threat to leave Villa Park. The only leading Premiership club apparently actively seeking a new goalkeeper are Arsenal. But it is debatable whether Ars\u00e8ne Wenger would invest in a player who may well have lived down the nickname of \"Calamity James\" but who is still prone to lapses in concentration and inconsistency. James's seeming inability to learn from countless mistakes ended his Liverpool career, G\u00e9rard Houllier offloading him to Villa 18 months ago for \u00a31.7m. Now, of James's desire to leave Villa, Ian Robathan, chairman of the Independent Supporters' Association, said: \"I'm not shocked by this - I'm not even surprised. We now have two of our senior players wanting away because they say the club lacks ambition. \"David James can see he isn't going to win things at Villa. We are not challenging for things and this has finally hit home with the players. We are now bracketed with Leicester and Tottenham when we want to be bracketed with Manchester United and Arsenal.\" The hunt for Robbie Keane intensified yesterday when Chelsea agreed a \u00a312m fee with Internazionale for the Republic of Ireland striker. But Chelsea are understood not to be confident about landing the 20-year-old because he would prefer to stay in Italy to prove himself after joining Inter only in August for \u00a312m. Keane said last night: \"I've got a contract [with Inter] for five years and as far as I'm concerned I'm staying here. I'm very happy here at the moment. I just want to get myself back fit and hopefully work myself back into the team.\" However, now Inter admit they are ready to sell, he must decide whether a return to the Premiership would be wiser. Although Keane has a choice of Premiership clubs if he does come back - West Ham failed with a \u00a310m offer on Thursday - the player would prefer Leeds. However, it is believed Inter want the Leeds midfielder Olivier Dacourt as part of the deal and David O'Leary is unwilling to approve that move. Another option is for Keane to go on loan until the end of the season to another Serie A club, with Napoli the most likely. All Chelsea's managing director Colin Hutchinson would say about the projected deal yesterday was: \"We have had discussions with Inter Milan about Robbie Keane.\" At least Chelsea's offer shows they are determined to reinvest the \u00a312m they received from Rangers for Tore Andre Flo. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

The long period without a derby has prevented either club from unleashing its own pent-up aggression. \"There's been a lot of hype and bravado about his game,\" added Wilson. \"It's supposed to be a big advertisement for east Lancs football and I really hope trouble doesn't kick off, but we could well end up looking at a hatefest.\" </p> <p>The authorities are fully aware of that. Kenneth Wolstenholme will be at Turf Moor commentating for Burnley's website, but every effort has been made to ensure there will be no people on the pitch.

Some 3,000 Rovers fans will travel; many supporters, home and way, will arrive at Turf Moor after time in the pub, which holds the additional attraction of the live midday match broadcast of Manchester United v Liverpool. </p> <p>\"This could be a special day,\" Souness believes and for genuine supporters it promises to be just that. The clubs have had contrasting fortunes since that infamous game 17 years ago. Blackburn, having flirted with promotion to the old First Division, were restored to the top flight by Kenny Dalglish and Jack Walker's millions and gorged on success for six years, winning the Premiership along the way. Meanwhile, Burnley sank without trace. </p> <p>On May 9 1987 they beat Leyton Orient in front of heaving terraces to preserve their League status. In 1991 they lost 2-1 on aggregate to Torquay in the Fourth Division play-offs while a light aeroplane circled above Turf Moor trailing the message: \"Staying down 4 ever, love Rovers. Ha, ha, ha.\" Rumours abounded that Garner had paid for the stunt. </p> <p>\"That was a return of serve after Burnley fans staged a staying-down party when Crystal Palace beat us in the 1989 play-offs,\" said Dave Metcalfe, editor of the Rovers fanzine 4,000 Holes. </p> <p>\"I stood on the Longside watching the play-off game when the famous plane went over,\" said Burnley's leading scorer Andy Payton. \"I don't want to stir any rivalry up, but obviously it is there.\" </p> <p>There was a mini-revival, but while Alan Shearer held aloft the Premiership trophy in 1995, Burnley licked their wounds after relegation back to the Second Division. \"The perception that Blackburn purchased their recent success has really grated with Burnley fans,\" said Wilson, which makes the Clarets' current two-point advantage all the more satisfying. </p> <p>\"We have been living in their shadow for a long time,\" added Peter Heywood, chairman of the Clarets' Independent Supporters' Association. \"Rovers are our only rivals. We are a football town in a way that perhaps Blackburn is not and we've watched while they've had all this money thrown at them.\" </p> <p>Not that the rivalry is one-way. On opening day this season Rovers, pre-season promotion favourites, beat Palace 2-0 but chants of \"Bring on the bastards\" echoed around Ewood. </p> <p>\"Burnley have had 17 years of low self-image watching our success, but that's exactly what we had to put up with in the 1960s while we were losing 7-1 at Shrewsbury and they were winning the League.

      "body": "<p>Mid-April, only weeks after a career change that had seen him swap a smallish pond for a very large pool, and Emile Heskey was enduring a spot of local difficulty. As an \u00a311m striker, the supporters of his new club, Liverpool, more or less assumed Heskey would spend his Saturday afternoons using to good advantage his more celebrated physical attributes, namely a body-builder's physique and a turn of speed which is the envy of most county-standard athletes. </p> <p>The expectation was that Heskey would become Liverpool's first battering ram-style centre-forward in many years - possibly since Michael Robinson ran himself daft in the famous red shirt back in the mid-80s in the mistaken, if endearing, belief that hard work will eventually a great player make. </p> <p>With bated breath the masses waited and waited for Heskey to emerge. It was possibly stage-fright, it might have been insecurity, it could even have been an inferiority complex, but it seemed that each and every time Heskey collected the ball he headed not for goal but for the touchline, drawn inexorably from the centre of the action to the periphery. </p> <p>His critics - and there were many at the time - had the answer. Not only was Heskey guilty of dereliction of duty, not only was he unable to cope with life in the fast lane, he was simply a waste of money. </p> <p>\"I take the point but I think it's what I did down the wings at Leicester City that earned me a reputation as a decent player,\" says Heskey in his defence. </p> <p>Heskey scored three times in his 12 senior appearances last season. It was an unremarkable return but one made memorable by the frequent response of his manager. G\u00e9rard Houllier clambered on to his soap-box to launch spirited, chest-thumping defences of the most expensive player ever to join a club where there have been so many truly great contributors that the merely proficient have been swallowed up and forgotten. </p> <p>Like a father chiding a wayward son, Houllier constantly reassured Heskey that he was a good player with the potential for excellence, that he did have the capacity to succeed and, perhaps most significant, that he was a far, far better player than he believed himself to be. </p> <p>It was, it would seem, all a matter of confidence. Or rather the lack of it. </p> <p>\"I have said before that maybe at times I haven't had the belief in myself that I should have had, but I do feel that is starting to change now,\" said Heskey in an accent that betrays his Leicester roots. </p> <p>\"I heard comments from people questioning my ability when I signed but, to be honest, the same things were said about me at Leicester. I knew it would take time to adapt to life at a new club but I think I did quite well towards the end of last season. </p> <p>\"This year I knew exactly what it was I had to do and I have worked hard to ensure I give myself the best possible chance of playing well.

Heskey arrived on Merseyside wondering precisely how he was supposed to lay claim to a regular first-team place at a club which boasted Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler. </p> <p>Now, after 12 goals in his past 12 full games, he is the man, the first choice.

      "trailText": "<p>Tongues wag as Dundee students line up Caniggia for rector and the truth about Wimbledon's woeful home form is revealed - it's not sex but Sam that is sapping the team's energy.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Now things are finally clear election-wise in America (the man who gained the smaller number of votes is the winner) we can turn our attention to another vital democratic contest. At Dundee University, everyone is getting very excited that Claudio Caniggia might, in early February, be elected the university's rector. If certain undergraduates get their way, Caniggia - the former Argentina international, coke head and the man once caught on camera snogging Diego Maradona (and, yes, tongues were involved) - could well be voted in as the students' representative on the university council. </p> <p>Caniggia has been causing something of a seismic disturbance in the east of Scotland since he arrived in Dundee. And not just because his wife cuts such an exotic sight in the local branch of Tesco. In the past Dundee FC didn't attract players of his pedigree. But manager Ivano Bonetti, plus several hundredweight of loose change a week, persuaded the player to come over from Buenos Aires at the start of this season. </p> <p>\"He's going down an absolute storm,\" says David McKinnie, a football correspondent for Scottish Television who has seen him play several times this season. \"Against Celtic last Sunday he was outstanding. What is amazing about him is that the pace is still there. I saw him putting in some extra training on his own the other week, so he's committed too.\" </p> <p>Dundee fans love him: blond wigs to match his scraggly locks have become an essential fashion item at Dens Park. Whether small packets of substances in the back pocket are another is not yet clear. And student supporters of the club thought it would be a mark of their appreciation for the newcomer to nominate him for the post of rector, a position voted for by the students every three years. </p> <p>\"As yet the nomination is not official,\" says John Cunningham, the president of the students union. \"Students have to gather 50 signatures to back a bid. But there appears to be a head of steam building up behind a nomination.\" </p> <p>Were Caniggia to be voted in, he would not be the first footballer to find himself in such a position. And before accepting the job, he might be wise to have a word with John Colquhoun, the former Hearts player, who was elected rector at Edinburgh University in 1997. </p> <p>\"At first I just thought it might be a bit of a laugh,\" says Colquhoun. \"I didn't know what it involved. But if you do the job properly, it's a fair commitment. Like most footballers, I was someone who had mentally ducked out of education at about the age of 12. So for me the learning curve was incredible. I suddenly found myself chair of the governing body of a community of 23,000 people. The moral and legal responsibility of that was staggering.\" </p> <p>According to Colquhoun, being the rector of one of the Scottish ancients, as the old-established universities are known, is not a simple matter of turning up on campus to accept the adulation of the students. The minimum requirement is to attend university council meetings six times a year. But many rectors become far more involved. </p> <p>\"The job is what you make of it,\" says Colquhoun. \"Edinburgh was very clever in using me to take their message into schools that might not normally consider sending people to the university. I enjoyed myself hugely, but I couldn't stand for a second term because I'd just started a business and I didn't have the time to do the job properly.\" </p> <p>There has been a trend over the past few years to nominate celebrities for the post because the attention they bring can help publicise student issues. Stephen Fry, who was rector at Dundee for six years, is seen as the model. </p> <p>\"Fry was phenomenally good,\" says John Cunningham. \"But the whole university can suffer if a celebrity rector can't commit the time. Just look at what happened with Ross Kemp at Glasgow.\" </p> <p>The Labour-loving luvvie has been, it is commonly considered, a huge disappointment since leaving EastEnders for Glasgow. So how would Caniggia cope? He might have the time now (presiding over a university governing body beats the snooker hall as a way for a footballer to pass his afternoons) but would he be able to commit himself to the full three-year period of office? </p> <p>Caniggia himself was not available for comment this week, as he was in Rome watching his old chum Diego receive Fifa's award as joint greatest player of the century. But a spokesman for Dundee FC tells me that he is very honoured by the attention. </p> <p>\"Claudio is a very erudite man,\" says the spokesman. \"He is erudite in several languages, though at the moment that doesn't include English.\" </p> <p>Never mind Florida and pregnant chads, there could be interesting times ahead in Dundee. </p> <p><strong>No sex, please - we're off goat-milking in Stavangar</strong></p> <p>Terry Burton, the Wimbledon manager, is an old-fashioned adherent to the belief that women weaken legs.

      "bodyText": "Now things are finally clear election-wise in America (the man who gained the smaller number of votes is the winner) we can turn our attention to another vital democratic contest. At Dundee University, everyone is getting very excited that Claudio Caniggia might, in early February, be elected the university's rector. If certain undergraduates get their way, Caniggia - the former Argentina international, coke head and the man once caught on camera snogging Diego Maradona (and, yes, tongues were involved) - could well be voted in as the students' representative on the university council. Caniggia has been causing something of a seismic disturbance in the east of Scotland since he arrived in Dundee. And not just because his wife cuts such an exotic sight in the local branch of Tesco. In the past Dundee FC didn't attract players of his pedigree. But manager Ivano Bonetti, plus several hundredweight of loose change a week, persuaded the player to come over from Buenos Aires at the start of this season. \"He's going down an absolute storm,\" says David McKinnie, a football correspondent for Scottish Television who has seen him play several times this season. \"Against Celtic last Sunday he was outstanding. What is amazing about him is that the pace is still there. I saw him putting in some extra training on his own the other week, so he's committed too.\" Dundee fans love him: blond wigs to match his scraggly locks have become an essential fashion item at Dens Park. Whether small packets of substances in the back pocket are another is not yet clear. And student supporters of the club thought it would be a mark of their appreciation for the newcomer to nominate him for the post of rector, a position voted for by the students every three years. \"As yet the nomination is not official,\" says John Cunningham, the president of the students union. \"Students have to gather 50 signatures to back a bid. But there appears to be a head of steam building up behind a nomination.\" Were Caniggia to be voted in, he would not be the first footballer to find himself in such a position. And before accepting the job, he might be wise to have a word with John Colquhoun, the former Hearts player, who was elected rector at Edinburgh University in 1997. \"At first I just thought it might be a bit of a laugh,\" says Colquhoun. \"I didn't know what it involved. But if you do the job properly, it's a fair commitment. Like most footballers, I was someone who had mentally ducked out of education at about the age of 12. So for me the learning curve was incredible. I suddenly found myself chair of the governing body of a community of 23,000 people. The moral and legal responsibility of that was staggering.\" According to Colquhoun, being the rector of one of the Scottish ancients, as the old-established universities are known, is not a simple matter of turning up on campus to accept the adulation of the students. The minimum requirement is to attend university council meetings six times a year. But many rectors become far more involved. \"The job is what you make of it,\" says Colquhoun. \"Edinburgh was very clever in using me to take their message into schools that might not normally consider sending people to the university. I enjoyed myself hugely, but I couldn't stand for a second term because I'd just started a business and I didn't have the time to do the job properly.\" There has been a trend over the past few years to nominate celebrities for the post because the attention they bring can help publicise student issues. Stephen Fry, who was rector at Dundee for six years, is seen as the model. \"Fry was phenomenally good,\" says John Cunningham. \"But the whole university can suffer if a celebrity rector can't commit the time. Just look at what happened with Ross Kemp at Glasgow.\" The Labour-loving luvvie has been, it is commonly considered, a huge disappointment since leaving EastEnders for Glasgow. So how would Caniggia cope? He might have the time now (presiding over a university governing body beats the snooker hall as a way for a footballer to pass his afternoons) but would he be able to commit himself to the full three-year period of office? Caniggia himself was not available for comment this week, as he was in Rome watching his old chum Diego receive Fifa's award as joint greatest player of the century. But a spokesman for Dundee FC tells me that he is very honoured by the attention. \"Claudio is a very erudite man,\" says the spokesman. \"He is erudite in several languages, though at the moment that doesn't include English.\" Never mind Florida and pregnant chads, there could be interesting times ahead in Dundee. No sex, please - we're off goat-milking in Stavangar Terry Burton, the Wimbledon manager, is an old-fashioned adherent to the belief that women weaken legs. Seeking a cause for his team's woeful home form, he has blamed nookie, reckoning his players exhaust themselves in the build up to big matches. \"Too many players are having sex the night before a home game,\" says Burton. \"While for away matches they are in a hotel, away from their partners and get plenty of rest.\" Since Wimbledon's away performances have been admirable, Burton is minded to make his squad stay in monastic seclusion in a hotel prior to home games, too.

But <strong> Freshers' Week</strong>, a joint initiative by a group of ski destination countries aimed at attracting first-time skiers and snowboarders to the slopes, has clearly not enjoyed quite the success they hoped for. According to a spokesman for the organisers, the Association of Snowsports Countries, several hundred of the January packages remain unsold. </p> <p>Tour operators offering them are Airtours (08701 577775), Crystal (0870 848 7000), Erna Low (020 7584 2841), First Choice (0870 754 3477), Flexiski (0870 9090329), Neilson (0990 994444), Ski Independence (0870 5550555), Swiss Travel Service (01992 56123), and Thomson (0870 606 1470). The deals are available in 24 resorts in Austria, Canada, France, Switzerland, Slovenia and the US. Most are for the week ending January 27 but some are also available for the previous week. </p> <p>\u0095 Skiers heading for <strong> Switzerland</strong> from regional airports can cut out the hassle of travelling via London this winter with a new range of fares to Berne on offer from KLM alps. A round trip from Manchester, with a change at Amsterdam's Schiphol, would cost \u00a3220.70 including tax, for example. The Swiss airport, which is likely to be much less congested than Geneva, is very close to the Bernese Oberland resorts, such as Grindelwald, Wengen and Murren. Minimum check-in time there is only 20 minutes and baggage reclaim should be significantly quicker than at busier airports. </p> <p>The new fares must be paid two weeks or more before departure and passengers are required to stay at least one Saturday night. KLM alps is also offering them from a clutch of other UK airports, including Glasgow and Birmingham. The return fare from the former is \u00a3259.30 from the latter \u00a3210. The airline flies non stop to Berne - twice a day except on Saturdays when it makes one round trip - from London City Airport. Call 08705 074074 for reservations but be persistent. When I checked it took some time to persuade KLM's call centre that the deals existed. </p> <p>\u0095 Vancouver-based developer Intrawest is to build a new mountain village in the French ski resort of <strong> Les Arcs</strong>. The pedestrian-only complex will be at 2,000ft and, on clear days, will offer views of Mont Blanc. It promises to be more photogenic than some of the earlier purpose-built ski developments in Savoie, avoiding the austere, monolithic look of the original buildings at La Plagne, for example, and following more closely the style of that resort's later addition, Belle-Plagne. </p> <p>Construction of the village, which will incorpo rate 800 apartments or other accommodation units, is expected to start in 2002 and will take six to 10 years to complete. Resorts already owned by Intrawest include Whistler, Panorama and Mont Tremblant in Canada, and Copper Mountain in Colorado. </p> <p>\u0095 For those who can tolerate a long road journey, Snowcoach (01727 866177) is offering 10-day, seven-night packages to <strong> St Gervais</strong>, with a departure on January 5, for the budget price of \u00a3288. That covers return travel from Watford, London Victoria or Dover, half-board accommodation based on two sharing, and includes afternoon tea and wine with dinner, at the Club Hotel Terminus. For a modest supplement, departures are also available from 30 other pick- up points in England and Wales. </p> <p>\u0095 Still tempted by a last-minute dash to the slopes for Christmas or New Year? Although at this late stage you'll probably have to drive to the Alps, the huge self-catering specialist <a href=\"http://www.interhome.co.uk\">Interhome</a> (020 8891 1294) has studios for up to two people and apartments for up to four in <strong> Chamonix</strong> for the week starting next Saturday. Prices are \u00a3257 and \u00a3368 respectively. </p> <p>The firm also has studios in <strong> Siviez</strong>, part of the Four Valleys network whose main resort is Verbier, for \u00a3245. For New Year, it has studios in <strong> Tignes</strong> for \u00a3364 and apartments for up to five for \u00a3680. All these prices include a booking fee but not the bill for final cleaning.</p> <p><strong>Snow show</strong><br><strong>Liz Russell</strong></p> <p>Early season conditions could be better across the European Alps. Temperatures have been warm for this time of the year and therefore the great snow base that was created in some resorts in November has been depleted. A weather front is expected towards the end of the week but temperatures will have to drop for the snow conditions within some resorts to be dramatically altered. </p> <p>America, unlike Europe is bitterly cold and has had huge snowfalls in the past couple of days, particularly in the mid-western states, which will mean excellent ski conditions for the next few days. Generally, the Canadian resorts have a good snow base for this time of the year. </p> <p> <strong> Austria</strong> </p> <p> There's still a lack of snow in Austria. <strong> St Anton</strong> is currently not open. Glacial resorts are the best to head for, such as <strong> Hintertux</strong> (***) or <strong> Pitztal</strong> (***), and even then the best skiing can be found at very high altitude, on the glacier. </p> <p> <strong> France</strong> </p> <p> The further south you head, the better the snow becomes. <strong> Serre Chevalier</strong> (***) has some great skiing and has received regular snowfalls over the last couple of weeks. However, <strong> Tignes</strong> (**) and the other more traditional early season resorts, are reported to have some good skiing on and off piste at high altitude. </p> <p> <strong> Switzerland </strong></p> <p><strong>Zermatt</strong> (***), <strong> St Moritz </strong> (***) and <strong> Saas Fee</strong> (***) are some of the best resorts to head for at the moment. Recent light snowfall has refreshed the slopes and some good conditions can be found on and off piste. </p> <p> <strong> Italy</strong> </p> <p> Warm temperatures have led to some melting but generally the snow base in the resorts in the Milky Way area, such as <strong> Sestriere </strong> (***), <strong> Sauze d'Oulx</strong> (***), is excellent for this time of the year. <strong> Cervinia</strong> (***) also has some great skiing and the ski links through to <strong> Zermatt</strong> in Switzerland are open creating a huge ski area for early season skiers. </p> <p> <strong> Andorra </strong></p> <p><strong>Soldeu</strong> (*) has very poor snow conditions although the resort does have a few lifts currently open. </p> <p> <strong> America</strong> </p> <p> While Europe suffers from warm temperatures, the US resorts are bitterly cold and have had huge snowfalls over the past couple of days. <strong> Squaw Valley</strong> (****), California has 20cm of new snow and <strong> Breckenridge</strong> (****), Colorado, has 15cm. This will ensure some fantastic powder skiing on and off piste over the next few days. Wrap up warm though. </p> <p> <strong> Canada </strong></p> <p><strong>Whistler</strong> (***) and <strong> Banff</strong> (***) have both had a dusting of new snow over the past few days which has refreshed the slopes and created some excellent conditions at high altitude. <strong> Fernie</strong> is yet to open. </p> <p> <strong> Key to conditions</strong> </p> <p> No snowflakes = a serious lack of snow - no lifts open. </p> <p>* = poor snow conditions, very few lifts open. </p> <p>** = conditions reasonable, some slopes in poor condition. </p> <p>*** = plenty of good skiing. </p> <p>**** = good conditions. </p> <p>***** = fantastic conditions on and off piste. </p> <p>\u0095 For the latest snow conditions in more than 250 resorts, check out <a href=\"http://www.skiclub.co.uk\">Ski Club of Great Britain</a>.</p>",

But Freshers' Week, a joint initiative by a group of ski destination countries aimed at attracting first-time skiers and snowboarders to the slopes, has clearly not enjoyed quite the success they hoped for. According to a spokesman for the organisers, the Association of Snowsports Countries, several hundred of the January packages remain unsold. Tour operators offering them are Airtours (08701 577775), Crystal (0870 848 7000), Erna Low (020 7584 2841), First Choice (0870 754 3477), Flexiski (0870 9090329), Neilson (0990 994444), Ski Independence (0870 5550555), Swiss Travel Service (01992 56123), and Thomson (0870 606 1470). The deals are available in 24 resorts in Austria, Canada, France, Switzerland, Slovenia and the US. Most are for the week ending January 27 but some are also available for the previous week. \u0095 Skiers heading for Switzerland from regional airports can cut out the hassle of travelling via London this winter with a new range of fares to Berne on offer from KLM alps. A round trip from Manchester, with a change at Amsterdam's Schiphol, would cost \u00a3220.70 including tax, for example. The Swiss airport, which is likely to be much less congested than Geneva, is very close to the Bernese Oberland resorts, such as Grindelwald, Wengen and Murren. Minimum check-in time there is only 20 minutes and baggage reclaim should be significantly quicker than at busier airports. The new fares must be paid two weeks or more before departure and passengers are required to stay at least one Saturday night. KLM alps is also offering them from a clutch of other UK airports, including Glasgow and Birmingham. The return fare from the former is \u00a3259.30 from the latter \u00a3210. The airline flies non stop to Berne - twice a day except on Saturdays when it makes one round trip - from London City Airport. Call 08705 074074 for reservations but be persistent. When I checked it took some time to persuade KLM's call centre that the deals existed. \u0095 Vancouver-based developer Intrawest is to build a new mountain village in the French ski resort of Les Arcs. The pedestrian-only complex will be at 2,000ft and, on clear days, will offer views of Mont Blanc. It promises to be more photogenic than some of the earlier purpose-built ski developments in Savoie, avoiding the austere, monolithic look of the original buildings at La Plagne, for example, and following more closely the style of that resort's later addition, Belle-Plagne. Construction of the village, which will incorpo rate 800 apartments or other accommodation units, is expected to start in 2002 and will take six to 10 years to complete. Resorts already owned by Intrawest include Whistler, Panorama and Mont Tremblant in Canada, and Copper Mountain in Colorado. \u0095 For those who can tolerate a long road journey, Snowcoach (01727 866177) is offering 10-day, seven-night packages to St Gervais, with a departure on January 5, for the budget price of \u00a3288. That covers return travel from Watford, London Victoria or Dover, half-board accommodation based on two sharing, and includes afternoon tea and wine with dinner, at the Club Hotel Terminus. For a modest supplement, departures are also available from 30 other pick- up points in England and Wales. \u0095 Still tempted by a last-minute dash to the slopes for Christmas or New Year? Although at this late stage you'll probably have to drive to the Alps, the huge self-catering specialist Interhome (020 8891 1294) has studios for up to two people and apartments for up to four in Chamonix for the week starting next Saturday. Prices are \u00a3257 and \u00a3368 respectively. The firm also has studios in Siviez, part of the Four Valleys network whose main resort is Verbier, for \u00a3245. For New Year, it has studios in Tignes for \u00a3364 and apartments for up to five for \u00a3680. All these prices include a booking fee but not the bill for final cleaning. Snow show Liz Russell Early season conditions could be better across the European Alps. Temperatures have been warm for this time of the year and therefore the great snow base that was created in some resorts in November has been depleted. A weather front is expected towards the end of the week but temperatures will have to drop for the snow conditions within some resorts to be dramatically altered. America, unlike Europe is bitterly cold and has had huge snowfalls in the past couple of days, particularly in the mid-western states, which will mean excellent ski conditions for the next few days. Generally, the Canadian resorts have a good snow base for this time of the year. Austria There's still a lack of snow in Austria. St Anton is currently not open. Glacial resorts are the best to head for, such as Hintertux (***) or Pitztal (***), and even then the best skiing can be found at very high altitude, on the glacier. France The further south you head, the better the snow becomes. Serre Chevalier (***) has some great skiing and has received regular snowfalls over the last couple of weeks. However, Tignes (**) and the other more traditional early season resorts, are reported to have some good skiing on and off piste at high altitude. Switzerland Zermatt (***), St Moritz (***) and Saas Fee (***) are some of the best resorts to head for at the moment. Recent light snowfall has refreshed the slopes and some good conditions can be found on and off piste. Italy Warm temperatures have led to some melting but generally the snow base in the resorts in the Milky Way area, such as Sestriere (***), Sauze d'Oulx (***), is excellent for this time of the year. Cervinia (***) also has some great skiing and the ski links through to Zermatt in Switzerland are open creating a huge ski area for early season skiers. Andorra Soldeu (*) has very poor snow conditions although the resort does have a few lifts currently open. America While Europe suffers from warm temperatures, the US resorts are bitterly cold and have had huge snowfalls over the past couple of days. Squaw Valley (****), California has 20cm of new snow and Breckenridge (****), Colorado, has 15cm. This will ensure some fantastic powder skiing on and off piste over the next few days. Wrap up warm though. Canada Whistler (***) and Banff (***) have both had a dusting of new snow over the past few days which has refreshed the slopes and created some excellent conditions at high altitude. Fernie is yet to open. Key to conditions No snowflakes = a serious lack of snow - no lifts open. * = poor snow conditions, very few lifts open. ** = conditions reasonable, some slopes in poor condition. *** = plenty of good skiing. **** = good conditions. ***** = fantastic conditions on and off piste. \u0095 For the latest snow conditions in more than 250 resorts, check out Ski Club of Great Britain.",

Here you can lose yourself without any help - wandering, drinking strong Dutch coffee and gazing at the glassy water as it reflects back wide-eyed windows and wobbly gables. </p> <p>As befits Amsterdam's fluidity, a 10-minute stroll can seamlessly blend the convivial charm of the trendy Jordaan District and the frantic pace of Dam Square. </p> <p>From Nieuwmarket to the Southern Canal Belt and out to Vondelpark, a patchwork of tram-scored streets, jangling neon squares, quiet alleyways and secluded courtyards, map out every pace and mood. It's the key to an open-minded city that revels in unexpected surprises behind the smoke and mirrors. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay</strong> </p> <p> The <strong> Grand Sofitel Demeure </strong> (Oudezijds Voorburgwal 197, tel: 555 3111, doubles from DG765 a night [\u00a3211], book from UK on 020 8283 4570) has gone through many identities, most recently until 1966 as Amsterdam's splendid town hall. Many original features remain, including a beautiful hand-painted wedding chamber, and its tranquil rooms with canalside or lush inner courtyard views are minutes away from the beating heart of Dam Square. </p> <p> <strong> Hotel de L'Europe </strong> (Nieuwe Doelenstraat 2-8, tel: 531 1777, doubles from DG655) has a world-weary exterior that hides a plush oasis overlooking the sweeping river Amstel. </p> <p>For ultimate privacy, <strong> Seven One Seven </strong> (Prinsengracht 717, tel: 423 0717, suites DG575-975) is a canal guesthouse hiding behind a discreet door plaque. Word of mouth ensures its eight individually-designed room/suites are in demand, so book well in advance for this hybrid of Old English country home and artist-colony eccentricity. </p> <p> <strong> The Ambassade </strong> (Herengracht 341, tel: 555 0222, doubles from DG350) occupies 10 canal houses, offering unpretentious creature comforts from a central location. </p> <p>Each room at the stately <strong> Hotel Filosoof </strong> (Anna van den Vondelstraat 6, tel 683 3013, doubles from DG155) is themed around a philosopher, while the small dining room also doubles as a library. </p> <p> <strong> What to see</strong> </p> <p> A stroll along the tree-lined waterways in the <strong> Southern Canal Belt </strong> can last a day. The three main outer canals, Herengracht, Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht were built ostensibly for wealthy residents, and the spindly architecture, resulting from a property \"width tax\", is a fascinating jumble of the beautiful and the curious. </p> <p>The <strong> Anne Frank House </strong> (Prinsengracht 263, tel: 556 71 00, DG10), where her family hid during the second world war, gets incredibly crowded, and there's little to see behind the blackout curtains, but the simplicity and claustrophobia is moving. </p> <p>The home of another of Amsterdam's famous citizens, <strong> Rembrandt </strong> (Jodenbreestraat 4-6, tel: 520 0400, DG12.50), is accessed through a hideous building, but once inside, accurate renovations successfully recreate his world. </p> <p>A large collection of Rembrandt's work, along with that of other Dutch masters, hangs in the palatial <strong> Rijksmuseum </strong> (Stadhouderskade 42, tel: 674 7074, DG15). With 5,000 paintings on display in 200 rooms, the experience can be a little overwhelming, and it pays to be selective. </p> <p>The <strong> Van Gogh Museum </strong> (Paulus Potterstraat 7, tel: 570 5200, DG15) behind the Rijksmuseum, is a model of space and light, displaying the progression of Van Gogh's paintings, from the dourness of The Potato Eaters to the colour explosion of his later work. </p> <p>The <strong> Stedlijk </strong> museum of modern art (Paulus Potterstraat 13, tel: 573 2737, DG9) includes works by C\u00e9zanne, Picasso, Chagall and Mondrian. </p> <p>The giant flea-market at Waterlooplein and the antiquarian book market at Spui are two of Amsterdam's 26 open-air bazaars, but the biggest draws are the flower markets, including a floating one on the Singel canal. </p> <p>Tulips from Amsterdam come in many forms, including rubber, plaster and kitschy wooden varieties. If you stick to the real thing, you'll have 2,700 varieties to choose from. The Queen of the Night black tulip costs DG7,50 for 15 bulbs. </p> <p> <strong> What to eat</strong> </p> <p> Amsterdam's restaurant scene is a cosmopolitan delight, marred only by the irritations of early closing times and the lack of credit-card payment facilities and non-smoking sections. </p> <p> <strong> D'Vijff Vlieghen </strong> (Spuistraat 294-302, tel: 624 8369) serves light new-Dutch cuisine in a dark gothic setting, spread over five adjoining 17th-century canal houses. Eat in the Rembrandt room and gaze up at four original etchings by the master on the wall. Main courses around DG48. </p> <p>Former weighhouse <strong> In de Waag </strong> (Nieuwmarkt 4, tel: 422 7772) is now a cavernous restaurant/caf\u00e9, with a spartan, candlelit interior. Main courses DG35. </p> <p> <strong> Caf\u00e9 Roux </strong> (Oudezijds Voorburgwal 197, tel: 555 3560), formerly the city hall canteen, now Albert Roux's stylish restaurant, has excellent food at surprisingly affordable prices. Main courses average DG40, but top value is the set dinner menu, with a choice of starter, main and desert for DG79.50. </p> <p> <strong> Caf\u00e9 de Jaren </strong> (Nieuwe Dolenstraat 20-22, tel: 625 5771) has an informal menu (main courses DG18.50) and a modern, high-ceilinged ambience with a hint of 1960s public library about it. Its terrace, overlooking the Amstel, is a lively evening spot. </p> <p>The numerous traditional brown caf\u00e9s serve strident meals, coffee, beer and conviviality. <strong> Het Molenpad </strong> (Prinsengracht 653, tel: 625 9680) has chaotic service, but basic, hearty fare for DG9.50-16.50. <strong> De Prins </strong> (Prinsengracht 124, tel: 624 9382) serves sociable fondues and stews (DG23.50), on canalside tables. </p> <p> <strong> Puri Mas </strong> (Lange Leidsedwarsstraat 37-41, tel: 627 7627) is one of many lively authentic Indonesian restaurants. </p> <p> <strong> Bars and nightlife</strong> </p> <p> Amsterdam loves a buzz, and at night the city erupts with energy at clubs, canalside pubs, concert halls and theatres. Caf\u00e9 culture is a day-into-night affair - either in brown caf\u00e9s like the <strong> Hoppe </strong> (Spui 18, tel: 420 4420) for a spot of Kopstodt (literally \"thump on the head\") - a combination of beer with a Jenever (Dutch gin) chaser - or ritzier venues like <strong> Caf\u00e9 Americain </strong> (Leideskade 97, tel:556 3232). </p> <p>The <strong> Concergebouw </strong> (Concertgebouwplein 2-6, tel: 675 4411) has near-perfect acoustics enjoyed by international orchestras and soloists, and the <strong> Stopera </strong> (Waterlooplein 22, tel: 625 5455) is home to the Netherlands Opera and National Ballet. </p> <p> <strong> Bimhuis </strong> (Oude Schans 73-77, tel: 623 1316) is the jazz joint for big-name and local performers. The <strong> Supperclub </strong> lounge (Jonge Roelensteeg 21, tel: 638 0513) is the terrain of the hip, with excellent weekly guest DJ nights. </p> <p> <strong> Melkweg </strong> (Lijbaansgracht 234, tel: 531 8181) is a lively one-stop shop, housing a cinema, art gallery, caf\u00e9, nightclub and concert hall in an old dairy. </p> <p> <strong> Tuschinski Theater </strong> (Regulierbreestraat 26-28, tel: 623 1510), a glorious 1920s movie palace, complete with Wurlitzer pipe organ, is the last word in film viewing - especially from its private balcony with a glass of champagne. Films are shown in English with Dutch subtitles - watch out for the bewildering intermission or \"pauze\" -guaranteed to interrupt the most cliffhanging moment. </p> <p> <strong> When to go</strong> </p> <p> Amsterdam has a wealth of major festivals and one-off events. For further information, contact the Amsterdam Tourist Board (tel: 00 31 900 400 40 40). </p> <p>The best-known include the <strong> Aalsmeer Flower Parade </strong>, an illuminated procession of floats through the city in September; the <strong> Saint Nicholas Parade </strong> in mid-November which launches the Christmas season; <strong> Amsterdam Blues Festival De Meervaart </strong> in March and the <strong> World Press Photo Exhibition </strong> at the Nieuwe Kerk in April. </p> <p>Smaller events include the <strong> Amsterdam Kite Festival </strong> in June and the <strong> Jordaan Music Festival </strong> in September. </p> <p> <strong> What to do for free</strong> </p> <p> Amsterdam boasts that its free attractions would fill a week, and it's not an idle claim. </p> <p>Some of the more interesting include the <strong> Civic Guards Gallery </strong>, where enormous 17th-century portraits of the Amsterdam Civic Guards (the most famous Rembrandt - The Nightwatch - hangs in the Rijksmuseum) hang in the passageway between the Kalverstraat and the Bejinhof. Vondelstraat hides the 19th-century <strong> Royal Riding School </strong>, inspired by the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. </p> <p>The <strong> Zuiderkerk </strong> church tower can be climbed for a fine view, before a free lunchtime concert at the <strong> Concertgebouw </strong> (Wednesday 12.30pm-1pm, often public rehearsals by orchestras performing later) or the <strong> Stadhuis </strong> (Tuesdays 12.30pm-1pm). The <strong> Rijksmuseum garden </strong> is a haven of fountains, flowers, sculpture and a curious collection of building fragments from Old Holland. </p> <p>The <strong> Magere Brug </strong> (Skinny Bridge) on Kerkstraat is a photographer's dream, especially when illuminated at night, while the world's narrowest house (one metre wide) is found along Oude Hoogstraat. For memorable sightseeing, join thousands of inline skaters congregating every Friday at 7pm, on <strong> Vondelpark </strong> to skate en-masse through the city.

But during the English Civil War, it became the unlikely scene of one of the most pathetic episodes in the whole of that bitter conflict. </p> <p>The walk starts in the village of Child Okeford, on the minor road north east of Shillingstone. Take the Steepleton Road past Fernhayes Copse, with the encircling earthworks of Hambledon prominent away to the left. A chalky farm track, signposted Hambledon Hill, leads off to the left and climbs through beeches to a stile that leads out on to the open downland. </p> <p>The path heads steeply up to the right across the ridged sheepwalks, aiming for the obvious saddle between the embankments of the northern end of the hillfort to your left and the slighter earthworks of an earlier neolithic camp on the right. </p> <p>At the top of the hill, turn left and walk along the embankments towards the 184m summit of Hambledon, enjoying its superb view across the Vale of Blackmoor towards prominent Melbury Beacon and the hilltop town of Shaftesbury to the north. </p> <p>This was the site of the Clubmen's last stand. They were a bucolic band of local peasants, sickened by the Civil War in which they had no interest, but which was seriously affecting their day-to-day lives. Troops from the conflicting armies trampled their crops, pillaged their villages and commandeered their corn. They rose up with no greater motive than the desire to protect their own hearths and homes. </p> <p>Led by the Rev Bravel, rector of nearby Compton Abbas, the Clubmen armed themselves with weapons hastily snatched from the farmyard: clubs, pitchforks, axes, scythes and some ancient halberds. Their badge was a white cockade, and they eventually mustered 5,000 red-faced men, drawn from the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire and Somerset with the rallying cry: \"For England and our homes.\" </p> <p>At first, they petitioned the King to stop the madness of the war, but they were ignored. Then they stormed the Parliamentary quarters at Sturminster Newton, but this brave action had no greater effect. Eventually, in the summer of 1645, they entrenched themselves on Castle Hill at Shaftesbury, only to be herded off like so many of their own downland sheep by Cromwell's well-drilled soldiers. </p> <p>Enraged by this, the Clubmen, now down to only about 2,000, encamped within the 2,000-year-old ramparts of Hambledon Hill, determined to fight to the death to gain the release of their leaders. The Rev Bravel, obviously better-equipped and more determined than most of his rabble army, threatened to pistol any Clubman who surrendered. </p> <p>The denouement was not long in coming. Cromwell sent 50 of his well-equipped dragoons to Hambledon, but their demand for the surrender of the hill was treated with contempt and a round of lead shot by the Rev Bravel. But the weathered Iron Age defences - once described as the \"nuclear deterrent of their age\" - proved no obstacle to the charging, sword-slashing dragoons, who swept through the entrance and over the ditches, overwhelming the yokels after what was described as \"a short dispute\". </p> <p>Cromwell's coldly-clinical description of the event states: \"They beat them from the work, and did some small execution upon them; I believe killed not 12 of them, but cut very many.\" </p> <p>The luckiest of the Clubmen escaped by sliding down the steep slopes of the hill, but many were taken prisoner by the dragoons and held overnight in the church at Shroton or Iwerne Courtney (it is one of the few villages in England with alternative names), in the shadow of Hambledon to the east. </p> <p>Cromwell's account of this rather sad episode in a letter to his commander in chief Sir Thomas Fairfax perhaps sums up his barely-concealed contempt for the disillusioned Clubmen. \"We have taken about 300, many of which are poor silly creatures, whom if you please to let me send home they promise to be very dutiful for time to come, and will be hanged before they come out again.\" </p> <p>From Hambledon Hill, retrace your steps south to the central col and the trig point which marks the site of the neolithic settlement. Continue south dropping down to the Cross Dyke and then up on the ridge through hawthorn scrub until the path descends steeply through Hambledon Plantation to reach the Child Okeford-Steepleton road near Keeper's Lodge. Bear right to the gate on the left which gives access to the National Trust's Hod Hill Estate. </p> <p>The battle of Hod Hill was much the same story as that of Hambledon except that it took place 1,600 years earlier. The Roman Second Legion under Vespasian attacked the hillfort on its all-conquering assault on 20 southern hillforts of the local Celtic tribe known as the Durotriges. Maiden Castle, Dorset's most mighty and famous hillfort, had already fallen under the might of Vespasian's military power. </p> <p>Excavations in the 1950s on what was thought to be the local chieftain's hut in the south-eastern part of the square-shaped hillfort made the dramatic discovery of 11 iron ballista bolts, still embedded in the chalk where they had been fired from a Roman siege engine in AD43. As there were no other signs of battle or war cemeteries on the site, it has been assumed that the Durotiges must have been so intimidated by this demonstration of state-of-the-art firepower that they simply surrendered. </p> <p>And as if to rub in their superiority, the Romans proceeded to build one of their standard, playing card-shaped forts actually within the Iron Age hillfort - the only one of its kind in Britain. </p> <p>Take your time as you walk round the 22-hectare fort, noting the fine defensive position chosen by the Durotiges on this headland above the winding River Stour, which can be seen in the valley below. There are also good aerial views towards Steepleton House in the wooded valley of the River Iwerne to the north. </p> <p>Now, take the steep path down from the south-western corner of the fort through the undergrowth to a pleasant, tree-lined riverside track along the Stour and back out on to the Steepleton road again, west of the Keeper's Lodge.

      "body": "<p>Carne-vale - or \"goodbye meat\" - may not sound like much of a turn on. But next February, as 40 days of Lenten sacrifice approach, parties will erupt around the world. From Venice to New Orleans, Malta to Tenerife, Bacchanalia will reign. Mardi Gras (Shrove Tuesday) is on February 27 - but most festivities begin a few days before. </p> <p><strong>New Orleans</strong></p> <p> <strong> February 16-27</strong> </p> <p>Mardi Gras, or \"Fat Tuesday\", is the biggest day in \"the biggest free show on Earth\". Over the 10 days immediately preceding Mardi Gras, the usual notions of taste are abandoned as an extravagant blow-out of parades, balls and free-floating jazz performances take a hold. By Shrove Tuesday, masked revellers are throwing coconuts, beads and doubloons to the crowds that jam the French Quarter, St Charles Avenue and Canal Street. As the revelry and spectacle reach great heights, so do the hotel prices. </p> <p>One week with BA Holidays (0870 6000500) costs from \u00a3633pp. </p> <p><strong>Venice</strong></p> <p><strong> February 17-27</strong> </p> <p>Cover your face for the queen of Europe's carnivals, the Venice Mask Carnival. It opens with a parade of masked figures carrying drums and torches in historic St Mark's Square and revives the traditional masked balls with elaborate costumes and theatrical performances of the 18th century. Certain balls are open to the public who must buy tickets in advance and soon - space is already very limited. Log on to <a href=\"http://www.meetingeurope.com\">Meeting Europe</a> or call 00 39 041 717065. In Venice's heyday the celebrations lasted six months. Now they're down to 10 days. </p> <p>Lakes and Mountains Holidays (01329 844 405) offers a three-night break for \u00a3700pp, including B&amp;B, tickets to the Casanova Masked Ball and a guided walking tour of the city, departing February 16. Extra nights from \u00a380pp. </p> <p>Details of local costume providers are available prior to departure. If you prefer to spectate, a three-night break in a central three-star hotel with Kirker Holidays (020-7231 3333) costs \u00a3358pp B&amp;B. </p> <p><strong>Nice</strong> </p> <p><strong> February 8 to 27</strong> </p> <p> The resort is host to one of Europe's largest and most colourful carnivals. As the 117th of its kind gets underway, expect daily float processions, flower-throwing and the burning of the carnival king. Just be prepared to share space along the Promenade des Anglais with around a million others. </p> <p>Travellers Cities (01959 540700) offers breaks throughout the event. Three nights' B&amp;B at the four-star Hotel Splendid, for example, seconds from the action, costs \u00a3289. </p> <p><strong>Malta</strong> </p> <p> <strong> February 22-27</strong> </p> <p> Malta's Mardi Gras is an island-wide celebration of masks and fireworks that dates back to 1535. Villagers put on their finery for religious processions, many children take their first communion, and ornate gold and silver church treasures are carried majestically through the streets. Decorated floats, masked processions and open-air dancing keep even the most dedicated sun worshippers off the beach. One week with Cadogan (023 8082 8306) costs from \u00a3287pp B&amp;B. </p> <p><strong>Cyprus</strong> </p> <p> <strong> February 18-25</strong> </p> <p> A scaled-down Notting Hill is how tour operator Sunvil describes Carnival in Cyprus, with the most elaborate floats and costumes swanning down the streets of Limassol. Children and teenagers are well catered for, with seafront stalls selling balloons, carnival dances at most of the resort's hotels and various fair stalls and rock bands pulsating in the Zoo Public Gardens. </p> <p>A week at the family-run three-star Alasia Hotel, near enough to be part of the action but quiet enough to sleep at night, with playground, tennis and heated pool, costs \u00a3350pp B&amp;B with Sunvil (020-8568 4499). Children discounted if their sharing parents' room. </p> <p><strong>Tenerife</strong> </p> <p> <strong> February 19 - March 4</strong> </p> <p> The Canary Islands get crazily colourful each carnival, none more so than Tenerife in the resort of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. There's all the usual merriment, music and dancing. One particular highlight is the burial of a giant sardine effigy, after it has been paraded through the streets on a throne, followed by an entourage of pregnant men. Don't ask. </p> <p>One week with Thomson (0990 502555) costs from \u00a3305pp. </p> <p><strong>Trinidad</strong> </p> <p> <strong> February 26 and 27</strong> </p> <p> Join in the Calypso at Trinidad's fantastic Carnival, the most famous in the Caribbean. The fun begins on the stroke of midnight on the Sunday before Lent. Carnival hits the streets of Port of Spain like a hurricane with a frenzy of dancing, bringing together the Caribbean's best musicians, along with truly spectacular costumes and a tropical sensuality. Get grandstand seats if you can - some of the costumes are more than 12ft high. </p> <p>Seven nights in Trinidad with Hayes and Jarvis (0870 8989890) costs from \u00a3899pp. The Caribbean Tourism Organisation (020-7222 4335) has full details of all the islands' carnivals and tour operators. </p> <p><strong>Sydney</strong></p> <p> <strong> February 9-March 4</strong> </p> <p> For Carnival with a difference, join the Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras 2001. More of a cultural event, it involves all manner of theatre acts, exhibitions and city tours. The main week (from Feb 26) brings a huge influx of tourists for the major gay and lesbian harbour cruise, a Saturday street parade and a carnival evening party. The festival's website is <a href=\"http://www.mardigras.com.au.\">Mardi Gras</a>. </p> <p>Man Around (020-8902 7177), Europe's biggest gay and lesbian tour operator, has 10-night packages to the Mardi Gras starting at \u00a31,475pp. The price, based on two sharing, includes return flights, 10 nights' room-only accommodation, a welcome pack of guides, maps and discount vouchers, a gay harbour cruise, grandstand viewing seats for the Mardi Gras Parade and a ticket to the famous Mardi Gras Party. </p> <p><strong>Goa</strong> </p> <p> <strong> February 25, 26 and 27</strong> </p> <p> Carnival is the highlight of the Goan calendar, introduced by the Portuguese in the 18th century as a way of letting off steam before the abstinence of Lent. There's four days of paint-throwing, music, cross-dressing and masked balls as King Mom, lord of misrule, takes charge. Panjim, the capital, is the focus of the action. </p> <p>One week with First Choice (0870 7500001) costs from \u00a3479pp. To celebrate in style, check into the Taj Exotica in Benaulim and join the celebrations in Margao, about 10km from the hotel, where thousands take part in a street festival of floats, dancers and bands - one week with Sovereign (08706 070770) starts from \u00a3905pp B&amp;B. </p> <p><strong>Rio</strong> </p> <p> <strong> February 24-28</strong> </p> <p> Samba rules in Rio. Groups with a different theme and style of costume parade in not-so-strict formation. The best groups parade in the Sambodoromo. For about \u00a3100, visitors can receive a costume and tuition, enabling them to take part. </p> <p>A week's B&amp;B in the four-star Copacabana Hotel with Trips Worldwide (0117 9872626) costs from \u00a31,593pp. </p> <p><strong>Quebec</strong> </p> <p> <strong> January 26 - February 11</strong> </p> <p>Around a Disney-esque ice palace, Quebecois indulge in snow bathing, snowmobiling, ice-carving competitions and float processions, all part of their Winter Carnival. The craziest event comes last, a canoe race across the frozen St Lawrence River (see <a href=\"http://www.carnaval.qc.ca\">Carnaval de Quebec</a> for details). One week with Travelpack (0870 1272001) costs from \u00a3600. </p> <p><strong>Valencia</strong> </p> <p> <strong> March 12-19</strong> </p> <p> Spain's most spectacular fiesta, Las Fallas, erupts in an explosion of fire, art and noise. Huge papier-mch\u00e9 monuments (fallas) are erected in the city's various districts and ceremoniously set alight on the final night of the fiesta, St Joseph's Day. Costing millions of pesetas each, the fallas depict satirical scenes ranging from local politicians to international celebrities. </p> <p>Be there with Mundi Color (020-7828 6021). A three-night break costs from \u00a3350pp B&amp;B. The <a href=\"http://www.landofvalencia.com\">Valencia Region Tourist Board</a> has all the gen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Carne-vale - or \"goodbye meat\" - may not sound like much of a turn on. But next February, as 40 days of Lenten sacrifice approach, parties will erupt around the world. From Venice to New Orleans, Malta to Tenerife, Bacchanalia will reign. Mardi Gras (Shrove Tuesday) is on February 27 - but most festivities begin a few days before. New Orleans February 16-27 Mardi Gras, or \"Fat Tuesday\", is the biggest day in \"the biggest free show on Earth\". Over the 10 days immediately preceding Mardi Gras, the usual notions of taste are abandoned as an extravagant blow-out of parades, balls and free-floating jazz performances take a hold. By Shrove Tuesday, masked revellers are throwing coconuts, beads and doubloons to the crowds that jam the French Quarter, St Charles Avenue and Canal Street. As the revelry and spectacle reach great heights, so do the hotel prices. One week with BA Holidays (0870 6000500) costs from \u00a3633pp. Venice February 17-27 Cover your face for the queen of Europe's carnivals, the Venice Mask Carnival. It opens with a parade of masked figures carrying drums and torches in historic St Mark's Square and revives the traditional masked balls with elaborate costumes and theatrical performances of the 18th century. Certain balls are open to the public who must buy tickets in advance and soon - space is already very limited. Log on to Meeting Europe or call 00 39 041 717065. In Venice's heyday the celebrations lasted six months. Now they're down to 10 days. Lakes and Mountains Holidays (01329 844 405) offers a three-night break for \u00a3700pp, including B&amp;B, tickets to the Casanova Masked Ball and a guided walking tour of the city, departing February 16. Extra nights from \u00a380pp. Details of local costume providers are available prior to departure. If you prefer to spectate, a three-night break in a central three-star hotel with Kirker Holidays (020-7231 3333) costs \u00a3358pp B&amp;B. Nice February 8 to 27 The resort is host to one of Europe's largest and most colourful carnivals. As the 117th of its kind gets underway, expect daily float processions, flower-throwing and the burning of the carnival king. Just be prepared to share space along the Promenade des Anglais with around a million others. Travellers Cities (01959 540700) offers breaks throughout the event. Three nights' B&amp;B at the four-star Hotel Splendid, for example, seconds from the action, costs \u00a3289. Malta February 22-27 Malta's Mardi Gras is an island-wide celebration of masks and fireworks that dates back to 1535. Villagers put on their finery for religious processions, many children take their first communion, and ornate gold and silver church treasures are carried majestically through the streets. Decorated floats, masked processions and open-air dancing keep even the most dedicated sun worshippers off the beach. One week with Cadogan (023 8082 8306) costs from \u00a3287pp B&amp;B. Cyprus February 18-25 A scaled-down Notting Hill is how tour operator Sunvil describes Carnival in Cyprus, with the most elaborate floats and costumes swanning down the streets of Limassol. Children and teenagers are well catered for, with seafront stalls selling balloons, carnival dances at most of the resort's hotels and various fair stalls and rock bands pulsating in the Zoo Public Gardens. A week at the family-run three-star Alasia Hotel, near enough to be part of the action but quiet enough to sleep at night, with playground, tennis and heated pool, costs \u00a3350pp B&amp;B with Sunvil (020-8568 4499). Children discounted if their sharing parents' room. Tenerife February 19 - March 4 The Canary Islands get crazily colourful each carnival, none more so than Tenerife in the resort of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. There's all the usual merriment, music and dancing. One particular highlight is the burial of a giant sardine effigy, after it has been paraded through the streets on a throne, followed by an entourage of pregnant men. Don't ask. One week with Thomson (0990 502555) costs from \u00a3305pp. Trinidad February 26 and 27 Join in the Calypso at Trinidad's fantastic Carnival, the most famous in the Caribbean. The fun begins on the stroke of midnight on the Sunday before Lent. Carnival hits the streets of Port of Spain like a hurricane with a frenzy of dancing, bringing together the Caribbean's best musicians, along with truly spectacular costumes and a tropical sensuality. Get grandstand seats if you can - some of the costumes are more than 12ft high. Seven nights in Trinidad with Hayes and Jarvis (0870 8989890) costs from \u00a3899pp. The Caribbean Tourism Organisation (020-7222 4335) has full details of all the islands' carnivals and tour operators. Sydney February 9-March 4 For Carnival with a difference, join the Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras 2001. More of a cultural event, it involves all manner of theatre acts, exhibitions and city tours. The main week (from Feb 26) brings a huge influx of tourists for the major gay and lesbian harbour cruise, a Saturday street parade and a carnival evening party. The festival's website is Mardi Gras. Man Around (020-8902 7177), Europe's biggest gay and lesbian tour operator, has 10-night packages to the Mardi Gras starting at \u00a31,475pp. The price, based on two sharing, includes return flights, 10 nights' room-only accommodation, a welcome pack of guides, maps and discount vouchers, a gay harbour cruise, grandstand viewing seats for the Mardi Gras Parade and a ticket to the famous Mardi Gras Party. Goa February 25, 26 and 27 Carnival is the highlight of the Goan calendar, introduced by the Portuguese in the 18th century as a way of letting off steam before the abstinence of Lent. There's four days of paint-throwing, music, cross-dressing and masked balls as King Mom, lord of misrule, takes charge. Panjim, the capital, is the focus of the action. One week with First Choice (0870 7500001) costs from \u00a3479pp. To celebrate in style, check into the Taj Exotica in Benaulim and join the celebrations in Margao, about 10km from the hotel, where thousands take part in a street festival of floats, dancers and bands - one week with Sovereign (08706 070770) starts from \u00a3905pp B&amp;B. Rio February 24-28 Samba rules in Rio. Groups with a different theme and style of costume parade in not-so-strict formation. The best groups parade in the Sambodoromo. For about \u00a3100, visitors can receive a costume and tuition, enabling them to take part. A week's B&amp;B in the four-star Copacabana Hotel with Trips Worldwide (0117 9872626) costs from \u00a31,593pp. Quebec January 26 - February 11 Around a Disney-esque ice palace, Quebecois indulge in snow bathing, snowmobiling, ice-carving competitions and float processions, all part of their Winter Carnival. The craziest event comes last, a canoe race across the frozen St Lawrence River (see Carnaval de Quebec for details). One week with Travelpack (0870 1272001) costs from \u00a3600. Valencia March 12-19 Spain's most spectacular fiesta, Las Fallas, erupts in an explosion of fire, art and noise. Huge papier-mch\u00e9 monuments (fallas) are erected in the city's various districts and ceremoniously set alight on the final night of the fiesta, St Joseph's Day. Costing millions of pesetas each, the fallas depict satirical scenes ranging from local politicians to international celebrities. Be there with Mundi Color (020-7828 6021). A three-night break costs from \u00a3350pp B&amp;B. The Valencia Region Tourist Board has all the gen.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Nine thousand feet up in the Andes, the Atacama desert bills itself as one of the highest, driest and remotest locations on Earth, and its other-worldliness invited the Spanish conquerors to name its barren, volcanic plains and valleys Muerte, Diablo and de la Luna. </p> <p>And it is here that you can stay in one of the world's hippest hotels, the Explora, set in 42 acres on the edge of San Pedro, an oasis wedged between the biggest salt flat in South America and the Andean mountain-tops. Explora, only two years old, has already made it into glossy style magazines and architectural coffee table books and, rather self-consciously, proclaims itself as a revolutionary travel experience. </p> <p>\"Explora is an enterprise founded to encourage a new attitude towards travel, which widens one's world and deepens the understanding of self. The architecture of Explora hotels makes it possible to inhabit the remote, it intends to reveal its mystery without solving it,\" says the brochure. </p> <p>I approached the Explora hotel gingerly, fearing an outbreak of overpaid AbFab-types getting in touch with themselves and the wilderness. But Explora is more eco-puritan than eco-hippy. True, it gives you Bolivian slate floors and rugs in the bedroom, pungent cypress wood ceilings and walls, an enormous Jacuzzi in your bathroom, and a vast shower offering a monsoon-like experience. But it won't let you put CNN on in your bedroom or pipe music into the bathroom as you sit Joan Collins-like under the Jacuzzi bubbles. There's no TV or mini-bar at Explora, no room-service menu and no morning papers shoved under the door. </p> <p>Once in your bedroom, you can't escape silence. Not that you care. Explora's most memorable aspect is its aspect; each bedroom has an almost 20ft wide panoramic window giving you an Imax-style view over the Atacama's weird landscape. A perfectly-formed volcano, snow-capped at its peak, sweeps down on your left, meeting another volcano on the right. </p> <p>Below them, the huge expanse of red earth, dented only by two or three giant gulleys, runs down to the base of your window. Not a single building, road, vegetation or people; handy, that last fact, as there's never any need to pull the curtains. You can sit in the Jacuzzi day or night and just stare and stare. Forget the moon; this looks like the view from hotel Mars. </p> <p>The abundance of water at the hotel nags at you; this can't be environmentally sustainable. But Explora says it has drilled its own deep water well, and every drop is recycled through irrigation channels to local farmers. Oh good, no guilt about using that monsoon shower, then. </p> <p>But Explora is not just about the hip hotel - indeed they prefer it if you don't hang around. Explora wants you to get your boots on. Late every afternoon, the guides, enthusiastically environmental (one was even ex-Rainbow Warrior), meet you in the hotel bar area to discuss and suggest suitable expeditions by foot, mountain bike or horse back. My first trip - you share hikes with up to six others plus the guide - was to the Valle de la Luna. Courtesy of the hotel's fleet of four-wheel-drives, you start the hike at the interesting bit, escaping other travellers and avoiding the dull hour's walk to Luna from the hotel. </p> <p>Luna is your first exposure to how totally lifeless and barren the Atacama is. It cuts through the salt, gypsum and clay of the \"Salt Range\", carving impressive but surprisingly fragile rock formations. Rain would erode and destroy Luna. It's just that it is never, ever forecast by the weathermen. </p> <p>The eerieness of the Atacama is not just the landscape; after a while, you notice what is missing: there are no sounds. No birds flapping past, no wind blowing through trees and leaves, nothing. Not even flies. (I saw just one fly in a week in the Atacama.) </p> <p>Some compare it to Arizona or Death Valley; I, a fan of trashy sci-fi, saw Hollywood. In Luna's deep gorges, you look up, expecting an attack from the sandmen in Star Wars or for Arnie to come tumbling down the long scree slopes in a scene from Total Recall. The landscape constantly invites comparison with the sets from Stargate, Starship Troopers and Mission to Mars. I was not alone in feeling a bit spacey in the Atacama: NASA road-tested its moon vehicles in the Valle de la Luna. </p> <p>All visitors end a trip to Luna watching the sun setting on the copper-burnished rocks. Which is a shame really, because you have to share it with about 100 other tourists sitting on the same outcrop admiring the view. Bring a plastic bag to sit on, then use it as a sledge to fly down the scree on the other side to your waiting wagon. Just don't leave it there. It's a tribute to eco-tourism in the Atacama that at no time do you see discarded Coke cans or water bottles. Or a tribute to the fact that, though increasingly popular, tourist numbers are still minimal. </p> <p>But hiking is for softies; the area is perfect for mountain biking. Being the Explora hotel, you get good bikes. Being the Atacama, you get the Diablo Valley. You reach it after cycling across dried-up river beds and through freezing streams running down from the Andes, then you skid and slide down tunnel-like gorges on the exhilarating ride home. All this under a beating sun; it was the Atacama's winter when I visited, but the temperature hovered around 25C most days, plunging to zero at night. In summer, however, the temperature ticks up only to around 30C. </p> <p>You realise pretty quickly that you are altitude training; the air is thin and one breathless member of our cycling party abandoned the trip early on. Nose-bleeds are a common curse; all of us suffered. If you're unfit, asthmatic and prone to nose-bleeds, the Atacama's probably not for you. </p> <p>The third trick in Explora's hand is its stables. I'm the sort of person who's scared of cats, but two days of lessons on Explora's silky horses and I fancied myself as a bit of gaucho, cantering over the desert. They even saddle you up in leathery chaps and Mask of Zorro style hats, so you get a bit of a kinky thrill out of it as well. </p> <p>Dusty, tired and dirty after every trek, you understand why Explora spent so much on its bathrooms. But it doesn't skimp in the kitchen either; despite its desert remoteness, each day's menu is different and features fresh fish, with sea bream and conger eel clearly Chilean favourites. The hotel's owner, one of Chile's richest individuals, owns a large vineyard in the Maipu valley in the south, so the wine is superb, too. </p> <p> But don't drink too much - many of the treks start early, and you won't want a hangover. At 7am one morning, we drove to the Puritama valley to start a hike at 10,000ft, finishing at 13,500ft. Oddly, life in this part of the Andes begins rather than ends at 10,000ft, as aridity is replaced by flowing meltwater. Giant cacti abound, wild donkeys stand completely placid on the rocky hillsides - it's something to do with the lithium in the soil. Plus there's ancient Atacamenian Indian huts, but with pre-Columbian historical data so flimsy, you politely agree with the guide that it's 2,500 years old and don't ask too many questions. </p> <p>Shortly after the climb steepens for an hour, your footing slips, breathlessness sets in and nerves become frayed. Then you turn a corner and collect your prize: a tumbling mountain stream surrounded by pampas grass, but with steam rising off it. It's not meltwater, but a hot river cascading down from the world's highest geysers. </p> <p>An hour later you approach the source, at 13,500ft. Ahead of you are a series of five pools - deserted but for staff from Explora, waiting for you with your luxury bathrobes. You slip into the hot pools, gazing out over the tips of the Andes, thinking this can't get much better. Then a waiter appears, placing wooden trays into the water, floating wine and canapes across to you. You grope for words to capture the serenity, beauty and luxury of it. Instead you say \"Just how **** off is this?\" And it really is. </p> <p>There's still plenty more treks to do - we all rather fancied the two-day trek to the top of the volcano, but Explora deliberately gives you too much choice; they want you to return. </p> <p>Five airports and 36 hours, later I am back at Heathrow. I take a black cab from Paddington station. Unbelieveably it breaks down and I'm turfed out on to a dodgy back street of Camberwell, South London, bags and all. The day before I was on the moon. Now it's back to reality. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Prices for seven nights start from \u00a32,470pp at Explora en Atacama based on two sharing and include: international flights on LanChile airlines, internal flights from Santiago to Calama, seven nights' full board (drinks and house wines), English-speaking guides, excursions, use of equipment and all transport. There is also an Explora en Patagonia.

From \u00a3450 double. Amangani, Wyoming, US (00 1 307 734 7333). </p> <p><strong> El Questro, Western Australia</strong> </p> <p>You can't get much further away from it all than the Aussie outback, which boasts some of the most ancient and untouched geology in the world. Unusually for an exclusive retreat, the ultra-modern El Questro accomodates a range of budgets - from riverside bungalows and luxurious tents to rooms in the main hotel, perched on the edge of a sandstone gorge. From \u00a330 for a single tented cabin to \u00a3378 for a homestead single. El Questro, Kununurra, Western Australia (00 61 8 9169 1777). </p> <p><strong> The Desert Resort Mandawa</strong> </p> <p>A collection of mud huts in the arid Rajasthani desert might not be your idea of holiday heaven, but The Desert Resort Mandawa is one of the most exotic hotels in the world. Its simple rooms are decorated with handmade silks and sanskrit texts and there's no chance of being disturbed by rush-hour traffic. From \u00a325 for a single. The Desert Resort Mandawa, Shekhawati, Rajasthan (00 91 1592 231 51). </p> <p><strong> Amanwana, Moyo Island, Indonesia</strong> </p> <p>Just getting there is half the fun - three flights, a cross-island drive and a boat ride bring you to Moyo Island, a virtually deserted slice of tropical Indonesian jungle. The resort is a collection of air-conditioned tents, complete with living room, writing desk, wardrobe space and double wash basins. All you have to do is choose your location: edge of beach or edge of jungle. Decisions, decisions. From \u00a3482 for a double inc all meals. Amanwana, Moyo Island, West Sumbawa Regency, Indonesia (00 62 371 222 33) </p> <p><strong> Ngorongoro Crater Lodge, Tanzania</strong> </p> <p>Described by French Elle as \"le Baroque ethnique\", the sumptiously decorated hotel at this World Heritage Site perches on the rim of the 1,600ft deep Ngorongoro Crater. The hotel's 30 super-luxe suites all look out on to the three-million-year-old remains of the once active volcano. Talk about rooms with a view. From \u00a3323pp. Ngorongoro Crater Lodge, Tanzania (00 27 11 775 0000). </p> <p><strong> Blancaneaux Lodge, Belize</strong> </p> <p>A little piece of paradise in the rainforest of Belize, Francis Ford Coppola's small eco-friendly retreat really has it all - a hydroelectric power source, river water clean enough to drink and Mayan ruins less than two hours drive away. It is also safe to say this is the only tropical mountain retreat complete with wood-fired pizza oven and espresso machine. From \u00a3107 for a double room. Blancaneaux Lodge, Cayo District, Belize (00 501 92 38 78). </p> <p><strong> The Ice Hotel, Sweden</strong> </p> <p>The world's coolest hotel is rebuilt every winter in Swedish Lapland using 35,000 tons of snow and ice. Plan your stay carefully, for by spring the whole place - bedrooms, bar, cinema, gallery, chapel and all - will have melted away. From \u00a3126 for double room, inc breakfast. The Ice Hotel, Jukkasjarvi, Sweden (00 46 980 668 00).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nine thousand feet up in the Andes, the Atacama desert bills itself as one of the highest, driest and remotest locations on Earth, and its other-worldliness invited the Spanish conquerors to name its barren, volcanic plains and valleys Muerte, Diablo and de la Luna. And it is here that you can stay in one of the world's hippest hotels, the Explora, set in 42 acres on the edge of San Pedro, an oasis wedged between the biggest salt flat in South America and the Andean mountain-tops. Explora, only two years old, has already made it into glossy style magazines and architectural coffee table books and, rather self-consciously, proclaims itself as a revolutionary travel experience. \"Explora is an enterprise founded to encourage a new attitude towards travel, which widens one's world and deepens the understanding of self. The architecture of Explora hotels makes it possible to inhabit the remote, it intends to reveal its mystery without solving it,\" says the brochure. I approached the Explora hotel gingerly, fearing an outbreak of overpaid AbFab-types getting in touch with themselves and the wilderness. But Explora is more eco-puritan than eco-hippy. True, it gives you Bolivian slate floors and rugs in the bedroom, pungent cypress wood ceilings and walls, an enormous Jacuzzi in your bathroom, and a vast shower offering a monsoon-like experience. But it won't let you put CNN on in your bedroom or pipe music into the bathroom as you sit Joan Collins-like under the Jacuzzi bubbles. There's no TV or mini-bar at Explora, no room-service menu and no morning papers shoved under the door. Once in your bedroom, you can't escape silence. Not that you care. Explora's most memorable aspect is its aspect; each bedroom has an almost 20ft wide panoramic window giving you an Imax-style view over the Atacama's weird landscape. A perfectly-formed volcano, snow-capped at its peak, sweeps down on your left, meeting another volcano on the right. Below them, the huge expanse of red earth, dented only by two or three giant gulleys, runs down to the base of your window. Not a single building, road, vegetation or people; handy, that last fact, as there's never any need to pull the curtains. You can sit in the Jacuzzi day or night and just stare and stare. Forget the moon; this looks like the view from hotel Mars. The abundance of water at the hotel nags at you; this can't be environmentally sustainable. But Explora says it has drilled its own deep water well, and every drop is recycled through irrigation channels to local farmers. Oh good, no guilt about using that monsoon shower, then. But Explora is not just about the hip hotel - indeed they prefer it if you don't hang around. Explora wants you to get your boots on. Late every afternoon, the guides, enthusiastically environmental (one was even ex-Rainbow Warrior), meet you in the hotel bar area to discuss and suggest suitable expeditions by foot, mountain bike or horse back. My first trip - you share hikes with up to six others plus the guide - was to the Valle de la Luna. Courtesy of the hotel's fleet of four-wheel-drives, you start the hike at the interesting bit, escaping other travellers and avoiding the dull hour's walk to Luna from the hotel. Luna is your first exposure to how totally lifeless and barren the Atacama is. It cuts through the salt, gypsum and clay of the \"Salt Range\", carving impressive but surprisingly fragile rock formations. Rain would erode and destroy Luna. It's just that it is never, ever forecast by the weathermen. The eerieness of the Atacama is not just the landscape; after a while, you notice what is missing: there are no sounds. No birds flapping past, no wind blowing through trees and leaves, nothing. Not even flies. (I saw just one fly in a week in the Atacama.) Some compare it to Arizona or Death Valley; I, a fan of trashy sci-fi, saw Hollywood. In Luna's deep gorges, you look up, expecting an attack from the sandmen in Star Wars or for Arnie to come tumbling down the long scree slopes in a scene from Total Recall. The landscape constantly invites comparison with the sets from Stargate, Starship Troopers and Mission to Mars. I was not alone in feeling a bit spacey in the Atacama: NASA road-tested its moon vehicles in the Valle de la Luna. All visitors end a trip to Luna watching the sun setting on the copper-burnished rocks. Which is a shame really, because you have to share it with about 100 other tourists sitting on the same outcrop admiring the view. Bring a plastic bag to sit on, then use it as a sledge to fly down the scree on the other side to your waiting wagon. Just don't leave it there. It's a tribute to eco-tourism in the Atacama that at no time do you see discarded Coke cans or water bottles. Or a tribute to the fact that, though increasingly popular, tourist numbers are still minimal. But hiking is for softies; the area is perfect for mountain biking. Being the Explora hotel, you get good bikes. Being the Atacama, you get the Diablo Valley. You reach it after cycling across dried-up river beds and through freezing streams running down from the Andes, then you skid and slide down tunnel-like gorges on the exhilarating ride home. All this under a beating sun; it was the Atacama's winter when I visited, but the temperature hovered around 25C most days, plunging to zero at night. In summer, however, the temperature ticks up only to around 30C. You realise pretty quickly that you are altitude training; the air is thin and one breathless member of our cycling party abandoned the trip early on. Nose-bleeds are a common curse; all of us suffered. If you're unfit, asthmatic and prone to nose-bleeds, the Atacama's probably not for you. The third trick in Explora's hand is its stables. I'm the sort of person who's scared of cats, but two days of lessons on Explora's silky horses and I fancied myself as a bit of gaucho, cantering over the desert. They even saddle you up in leathery chaps and Mask of Zorro style hats, so you get a bit of a kinky thrill out of it as well. Dusty, tired and dirty after every trek, you understand why Explora spent so much on its bathrooms. But it doesn't skimp in the kitchen either; despite its desert remoteness, each day's menu is different and features fresh fish, with sea bream and conger eel clearly Chilean favourites. The hotel's owner, one of Chile's richest individuals, owns a large vineyard in the Maipu valley in the south, so the wine is superb, too. But don't drink too much - many of the treks start early, and you won't want a hangover. At 7am one morning, we drove to the Puritama valley to start a hike at 10,000ft, finishing at 13,500ft. Oddly, life in this part of the Andes begins rather than ends at 10,000ft, as aridity is replaced by flowing meltwater. Giant cacti abound, wild donkeys stand completely placid on the rocky hillsides - it's something to do with the lithium in the soil. Plus there's ancient Atacamenian Indian huts, but with pre-Columbian historical data so flimsy, you politely agree with the guide that it's 2,500 years old and don't ask too many questions. Shortly after the climb steepens for an hour, your footing slips, breathlessness sets in and nerves become frayed. Then you turn a corner and collect your prize: a tumbling mountain stream surrounded by pampas grass, but with steam rising off it. It's not meltwater, but a hot river cascading down from the world's highest geysers. An hour later you approach the source, at 13,500ft. Ahead of you are a series of five pools - deserted but for staff from Explora, waiting for you with your luxury bathrobes. You slip into the hot pools, gazing out over the tips of the Andes, thinking this can't get much better. Then a waiter appears, placing wooden trays into the water, floating wine and canapes across to you. You grope for words to capture the serenity, beauty and luxury of it. Instead you say \"Just how **** off is this?\" And it really is. There's still plenty more treks to do - we all rather fancied the two-day trek to the top of the volcano, but Explora deliberately gives you too much choice; they want you to return. Five airports and 36 hours, later I am back at Heathrow. I take a black cab from Paddington station. Unbelieveably it breaks down and I'm turfed out on to a dodgy back street of Camberwell, South London, bags and all. The day before I was on the moon. Now it's back to reality. The practicals Prices for seven nights start from \u00a32,470pp at Explora en Atacama based on two sharing and include: international flights on LanChile airlines, internal flights from Santiago to Calama, seven nights' full board (drinks and house wines), English-speaking guides, excursions, use of equipment and all transport. There is also an Explora en Patagonia. For further information and reservations, contact Journey Latin America on 020-8747 8315/0161-832 1441. Seven other hotels where you can get away from it all in style Joanna Israelsohn Amangani, Wyoming, US The ultimate in rustic Ralph Lauren chic, Amangani's huge bedrooms, complete with remote-control fires, overlook the spectacular Wyoming Rockies, home to grizzly bears, and wolves and more names on the Forbes 400 than anywhere else in the US. From \u00a3450 double. Amangani, Wyoming, US (00 1 307 734 7333). El Questro, Western Australia You can't get much further away from it all than the Aussie outback, which boasts some of the most ancient and untouched geology in the world. Unusually for an exclusive retreat, the ultra-modern El Questro accomodates a range of budgets - from riverside bungalows and luxurious tents to rooms in the main hotel, perched on the edge of a sandstone gorge. From \u00a330 for a single tented cabin to \u00a3378 for a homestead single. El Questro, Kununurra, Western Australia (00 61 8 9169 1777). The Desert Resort Mandawa A collection of mud huts in the arid Rajasthani desert might not be your idea of holiday heaven, but The Desert Resort Mandawa is one of the most exotic hotels in the world. Its simple rooms are decorated with handmade silks and sanskrit texts and there's no chance of being disturbed by rush-hour traffic. From \u00a325 for a single. The Desert Resort Mandawa, Shekhawati, Rajasthan (00 91 1592 231 51). Amanwana, Moyo Island, Indonesia Just getting there is half the fun - three flights, a cross-island drive and a boat ride bring you to Moyo Island, a virtually deserted slice of tropical Indonesian jungle. The resort is a collection of air-conditioned tents, complete with living room, writing desk, wardrobe space and double wash basins. All you have to do is choose your location: edge of beach or edge of jungle. Decisions, decisions. From \u00a3482 for a double inc all meals. Amanwana, Moyo Island, West Sumbawa Regency, Indonesia (00 62 371 222 33) Ngorongoro Crater Lodge, Tanzania Described by French Elle as \"le Baroque ethnique\", the sumptiously decorated hotel at this World Heritage Site perches on the rim of the 1,600ft deep Ngorongoro Crater. The hotel's 30 super-luxe suites all look out on to the three-million-year-old remains of the once active volcano. Talk about rooms with a view. From \u00a3323pp. Ngorongoro Crater Lodge, Tanzania (00 27 11 775 0000). Blancaneaux Lodge, Belize A little piece of paradise in the rainforest of Belize, Francis Ford Coppola's small eco-friendly retreat really has it all - a hydroelectric power source, river water clean enough to drink and Mayan ruins less than two hours drive away. It is also safe to say this is the only tropical mountain retreat complete with wood-fired pizza oven and espresso machine. From \u00a3107 for a double room. Blancaneaux Lodge, Cayo District, Belize (00 501 92 38 78). The Ice Hotel, Sweden The world's coolest hotel is rebuilt every winter in Swedish Lapland using 35,000 tons of snow and ice. Plan your stay carefully, for by spring the whole place - bedrooms, bar, cinema, gallery, chapel and all - will have melted away. From \u00a3126 for double room, inc breakfast. The Ice Hotel, Jukkasjarvi, Sweden (00 46 980 668 00).",

When asked which methods would be used to research holiday arrangements, 67.4% said advice from family/friends, 72% mentioned guide books and 72% the internet. The travel agent was used by 56%. (Respondents were allowed to give more than one preference.) </p> <p>But the internet did not do so well when it came to paying for holidays, with 28% chosing it as a possible method; 28% were likely to go direct with an operator, 13.5% to phone up after seeing a classified ad in a newspaper or magazine, and 56% would expect to use a travel agent. </p> <p>The young professionals preferred holiday destinations were spread throughout the world. Western Europe came top with 19.3%, narrowly ahead of Australia/New Zealand 18.5%, Eastern Europe 16.8%, Africa 16%, South/Central America 13.9%, Asia 9.7%, US 9.2%, Round the World 7.1%, and other 10.5%. </p> <p>Asked what type of activities they enjoyed doing on holiday, culture came top, with cultural sites/attractions appealing to 77.3%. Eating scored 76.4%, relaxing 75.1%, walking 68.6%, socialising 63.3%, shopping 54.6%, adrenaline sports 32.8%, cycling 27.9%, sailing 17.5%, scuba diving 26.2% and climbing 17.9%. </p> <p>The research was commissioned by Independent Traveller's World, a travel show running February 23-25 at the Business Design Centre in Islington, London.

      "bodyText": "What young professionals want from a holiday Nearly 50% of young professionals will travel solo in 2001, and \"cultural interest\" and \"the desire to travel to somewhere never travelled before\" are their two main motivators, according to some new research. The survey of 300 young professionals also confirms the growing importance of the internet and guide books in influencing holiday destinations. When asked which methods would be used to research holiday arrangements, 67.4% said advice from family/friends, 72% mentioned guide books and 72% the internet. The travel agent was used by 56%. (Respondents were allowed to give more than one preference.) But the internet did not do so well when it came to paying for holidays, with 28% chosing it as a possible method; 28% were likely to go direct with an operator, 13.5% to phone up after seeing a classified ad in a newspaper or magazine, and 56% would expect to use a travel agent. The young professionals preferred holiday destinations were spread throughout the world. Western Europe came top with 19.3%, narrowly ahead of Australia/New Zealand 18.5%, Eastern Europe 16.8%, Africa 16%, South/Central America 13.9%, Asia 9.7%, US 9.2%, Round the World 7.1%, and other 10.5%. Asked what type of activities they enjoyed doing on holiday, culture came top, with cultural sites/attractions appealing to 77.3%. Eating scored 76.4%, relaxing 75.1%, walking 68.6%, socialising 63.3%, shopping 54.6%, adrenaline sports 32.8%, cycling 27.9%, sailing 17.5%, scuba diving 26.2% and climbing 17.9%. The research was commissioned by Independent Traveller's World, a travel show running February 23-25 at the Business Design Centre in Islington, London. Tickets cost \u00a35 in advance at ITW Show or 0870 3331456. Guardian wins The Guardian has been awarded the Germany Tourism Media Trophy. This trophy - a bust of Goethe - goes to the publication judged to have made the most outstanding contribution to the promotion of travel to Germany during the year. The awards were made at a ceremony hosted by the German ambassador, Dr Hans-Friedrich von Ploetz. In 1999, UK travellers spent 3.4 million overnight stays in Germany, surpassing the previous record of 1990 - the year that the Berlin Wall came down. This year the number of UK visitors has risen by 14.4% so far.",

I don't know what that means.\"</p> <p>The same appetite Jeff brought to the arts - absorbing a musician's or writer's body of work - was applied to his search for Tim. When Judy Buckley, Tim's widow, gave him tickets to a concert by the Cocteau Twins, Jeff told a friend he kissed Judy on the mouth - partly, he said, out of appreciation, and partly to feel exactly what Tim had seen in this woman. Even as he attempted to sort out the good, bad and ugly in his family's story, there remained the matter of his own music and career. He made a demo of four songs, which he called the Babylon Dungeon Sessions tape, but had had no response from the record companies, and his lack of a band meant he couldn't perform.</p> <p>Then, early in 1991, Jeff was back on the west coast when the phone rang at the house where he was staying. A woman was calling long-distance, from New York, to tell Jeff about an upcoming concert she was co-ordinating. It was a tribute to his father, and she asked if he would like to attend.</p> <p>No one working on the Greetings From Tim Buckley tribute concert at St Ann's, an arts centre in Brooklyn Heights, had known there was a son. Early on, one of concert organiser Janine Nichols's tasks was to find a publicity photograph of Tim, and she tracked down the name and number of Tim's old manager, Herb Cohen. In his cut-to-the-chase manner, Cohen said he not only had photographs but news: \"You know he has a kid?\" And, he continued, the child was more talented than his father. Nichols didn't think much of the information; offspring of 60s rock stars had begun sprouting up on the fringes of the music business, and most of them inherited their parents' looks but rarely their talent. Nevertheless, she jotted down the kid's name and number; the least they could do was invite him to the concert.</p> <p>Nichols dialled the Los Angeles number, and the first thing she noticed about the voice on the other end of the line was how tiny it sounded. When she told Jeff why she was calling, he was hesitant. He'd never sung his father's music in public, he said, and had spent only a very limited amount of time with Tim. Nichols could tell he was very conflicted, and the faint voice asked for time to think it over.</p> <p>Jeff mulled over the unexpected invitation. He still had ambivalent feelings about the paternal figure he barely recalled, and he had long studiously avoided any public connection to him. Yet something about the idea intrigued him. He called his mother and told her about the call. \"I said, 'Well, what's your purpose? What do you want to get out of it?'\" Mary recalls. \"And he said, 'I always missed not going to the funeral.' I said, 'There you go - there's your reason, you'll pay tribute to your father.' \" At the same time, she warned him to stay away from anyone who approached him about becoming \"the next Tim Buckley\".</p> <p>By the time Nichols called back, about a month before the concert, Jeff had warmed to the idea. Neither of the organisers was sold on the kid's talent. They had listened to the demo tape he had sent and found it noisy. Still, Jeff agreed to come.</p> <p>The tribute concert was part way through when a new group of musicians took the stage. One of them was a long-haired kid wearing a black T-shirt. Danny Fields, Tim's one-time publicist, was in the audience, keeping an eye out for the supposed son. Though Jeff had his back to the audience as he tuned his guitar, the spotlight caught his profile and one cheekbone. \"And I said, 'Whoa - there he is,' \" Fields recalls. \"I didn't have to wonder too hard. It could take your breath away.\" (\"My God,\" Jeff said to a friend after the show, \"I stepped onstage and they backlit it and it was like the fucking Second Coming.\")</p> <p>Jeff, who had billed himself as Jeff Scott Buckley, began strumming rigorously as Gary Lucas, formerly with Captain Beefheart's band, surrounded him with waves of soaring-seagull guitar swoops. It was I Never Asked To Be Your Mountain, Tim's song to Mary and her son. The audience suddenly stopped glancing at their watches. After an hour of esoteric music, here was one of Tim's most recognisable songs, emanating from a very recognisable face and sung in a familiar (if slightly deeper) voice. Just before he went on stage, Jeff had finished writing his own verse for the song: \"My love is the flower that lies among the graves,\" it began, ending with a plea to \"spread my ash along the way\". Anyone familiar with the subject matter of the song knew that this performance was more than a faithful rendition of a 60s oldie. It was a tribute, retort and catharsis all in one.</p> <p>When it was time for a finale, Jeff appeared on stage alone. \"Uhh,\" he started, with a nervous giggle, \"a long time ago, when I was a little kid, my mom sat in a bed and she put this record on. And, uhh, it was like the first song where I ever heard my father's voice. I must have been ... umm ... six. I was bored.\" He chuckled winsomely. \"I was bored. I'm sorry. But you know, what can you expect from a cat who's into Sesame Street at the time?\"</p> <p>Then he began singing Once I Was. Here was Jeff, on stage, singing his father's wistful remembrance of an old affair. Suddenly, before the last chorus, a string broke on his acoustic guitar and Jeff sang the lines, \"Sometimes, I wonder for a while/Do you ever remember me?\" unaccompanied. If that weren't dramatic enough, his voice spiralled up on the last word - \"me\" - like a thin plume of smoke, holding on for a moment before drifting up to the ceiling. He took a quick bow, said \"thanks\", disappeared off stage, and the concert ended. The audience was abuzz. So that was the son. Within a month, four record companies were vying for him. The irony of the situation was not lost on Jeff: after years of avoiding any connection with his late father, he had awakened the interest of the music business as a result of singing Tim's music, and he was being checked out by veteran record executives old enough to remember and admire his father. \"I'm convinced part of the reason I got signed is because of who I am,\" Jeff said in 1993. \"And it makes me sad.

After training in Rembrandt's studio in the early 1640s, he moved to Delft in 1650 and did illusionistic murals and views of the city that experiment with strange perspectives and feature lonely, desolate characters. He was the most promising artist in a city where Pieter de Hooch and Jan Steen were also at work. He was young, gifted and had connections with the court of Orange. But at 10.30am on October 12, 1654, the gunpowder magazine of Delft exploded, leaving a vast, water-filled crater and devastating a large section of the city. The 32-year-old Fabritius was among the dead. </p> <p><strong> Subject:</strong> The uncompromising way he looks at us and the experimental nature of this painting make it almost certain this is a <a href=\"http://www.kfki.hu/~arthp/html/f/fabritiu/self_por.html\" target=\"_new\">self-portrait</a>. Rembrandt painted several self-portraits in which he affected military dress, and his former pupil seems to be playing the same game here. </p> <p><strong> Distinguishing features:</strong> He might be studying himself in the mirror, there's such a critical, mocking acuteness to those big, dark eyes, an honesty about who he is - the unshaven, creased lower cheek, the unkempt hair under the fine woolly hat - that makes the military armour he is wearing ironic. We don't think for one minute he's a soldier. He's a young man adopting armour as a badge of dashing ways and perhaps also as an assertion of the nobility of art: the artist as hero. His eyebrows flare furiously and his gaze is intense; you can't look back for long. </p> <p>This is the self isolated, framed alone in space, and heightened by the setting of a storm-threatening sky, which was very unusual in 17th-century art. Out of the heavens, this picture suggests, a turbulent rainstorm, a bolt of lightning might come at any moment. And the same is true of the young man in armour, whose martial dress signifies rage and violence. He's a passionate man, a tempestuous soul full of energy. </p> <p>It's impossible to look at this painting without mournful hindsight. It is signed and dated C Fabritius 1654, so it must have been painted, at the most, months before his death. There is a painting, also in the National Gallery, by the Delft painter Egbert van der Poel of the scene just after the explosion. It shows a space cleared of houses, with nothing but dirt, water and broken timbers. Houses are shells, the sky is as tumultuous as that in Fabritius's self-portrait, and in the foreground survivors are pulled clear of the rubble, while corpses - perhaps Fabritius among them - are wrapped in canvas shrouds. Van der Poel did 12 versions, so there must have been a demand for what appears to be an eyewitness record of the horror. </p> <p>Fabritius's death was regarded by contemporaries as a tragedy - he was the most talented of Rembrandt's pupils. This self-portrait proves he was special. It is not in the least derivative of Rembrandt: Fabritius has a very distinctive, pale palette and a sparse, rigorous dryness completely different from Rembrandt's dark luxury. Yet, as in a Rembrandt portrait, you feel this is not just paint on canvas, but a real, rather astringent human mind confronting you. </p> <p> <strong> Inspirations and influences: </strong> Fabritius was most famous for his murals, which were said to perfectly deceive the eye with their perspective realism. His extant paintings - especially his View of the City of Delft (1652) in the National Gallery - deploy disconcerting, panoramic trick perspectives and seem to have been connected to the optical experiments that fascinated the 17th-century Dutch, including Jan Vermeer, who probably used a camera obscura for his interior views. Vermeer, also a Delft artist, owned paintings by Fabritius. The biggest influence Fabritius had on Vermeer is the emotional texture of his painting, which is seen in this self-portrait as well as his nearly empty cityscapes: a melancholia and a reticence. </p> <p> <strong>Where is it?</strong> The National Gallery, London WC2 (020-7747 2885).</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>June Whitfield</strong></p> <p>Actor<br></p> <p> My favourite book this year was undoubtedly Chocolat by Joanne Harris (Bantam, \u00a36.99). I was spellbound from start to finish, savouring the atmosphere of the little French village and almost tasting the delicious chocolate creations of Vianne. I would recommend it to everyone, chocoholic or not.</p> <p><strong>David Hare</strong></p> <p>Playwright<br></p> <p> Bernard Berenson: \"Culture is like a match burning in infinite darkness.\" Cyril Connolly: \"Why do people always want to blow it out?\" Bernard Berenson : \"They don't want to, they just have to blow.\" As director of the Proms and the Edinburgh Festival, John Drummond has lived a life of heroic defiance against Berenson's blowers. His autobiography Tainted by Experience (Faber, \u00a325) is even better than you would expect: illuminating about great music and musicians, crotchety, cheerful and highly enjoyable.</p> <p><strong>Paul Theroux</strong></p> <p>Writer<br></p> <p> I greatly enjoyed Nixon by Anthony Summers (Gollancz, \u00a320), a superbly researched and documented biography which I think is the last word on this dark and devious man. The facts about the Amazon set out by Patrick Tierney in Darkness in El Dorado (Norton, \u00a327) appalled me but everyone should know them. This year I also managed to track down a scarce book that has eluded me for many years, Club Types of Nuclear Polynesia (1913) by William Churchill - the \"club types\" are not hearty, snooty, sherry drinkers but rather war clubs, marvels of Pacific art.</p> <p> <strong>Antony Sher </strong></p> <p>Actor and writer<br></p> <p> I was a schoolboy in Cape Town in 1966 when Prime Minister Verwoerd was stabbed to death in parliament. In A Mouthful of Glass (Granta, \u00a312.99), Henk van Woerden has written a delicate, haunting biography of the assassin, Tsafendas, who was shunned by his family and kicked from country to country like junk because he was of mixed race. After the assassination he was certified mad. But are we born mad or do we have madness thrust upon us? Van Woerden's compassionate book addresses this question superbly.</p> <p> <strong>Angela Rippon</strong></p> <p>Broadcaster<br></p> <p> I couldn't wait for He Shall Thunder in the Sky (US: Avon Books, $7.50), the 12th Amelia Peabody mystery from the pen of Elizabeth Peters, so I bought it on the internet and paid a fortune to have it shipped from America on publication day. The books are set in Egypt at the turn of the century and are funny, informative, engrossing and completely unputdownable, with a cast of characters that become real to the reader from the very first book in the series, Crocodile on the Sandbank.</p> <p><strong>John Mortimer</strong></p> <p>Writer<br></p> <p> Did Boswell invent Johnson, taking the author of some rather dull plays and pontificating journalism and and turning him into a fictional character as lovable and immortal as Falstaff or Micawber? This idea lies behind Adam Sisman's Boswell's Presumptuous Task (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a317.99). No doubt Johnson was a great old sage, but Boswell emerges as the man of today. Often vain, frequently insecure, constantly lecherous, but an honest observer of his own weaknesses -and splendid company. He and Johnson were lucky to have found each other and to provide the material for another constantly entertaining book. </p> <p><strong>Rolf Harris</strong></p> <p>Entertainer<br></p> <p> The Last English King by Julian Rathbone (Little, Brown, \u00a316.99) is about the time of King Harold, Edward the Confessor and William the Conqueror. It's a brilliant factual account in novel form which wonderfully explains what England was like before the Normans invaded.</p> <p><strong>Robert Harris</strong></p> <p>Novelist<br></p> <p> I have to confess, guiltily, to having immensely enjoyed the second volume of Alan Clark's diaries, Into Politics (Weidenfeld, \u00a320). It may not have been as good as the first, but there is something almost heroic about Clark's reckless self-obsession. Boswell's Presumptuous Task by Adam Sisman (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a317.99) succeeded triumphantly in focusing on one great human endeavour - the writing of the life of Samuel Johnson - and conjured from it a variety of insights into the nature of authorship, literary rivalry, fame, ambition, jealousy and friendship. I also much enjoyed Nero: The Man Behind the Myth by Richard Holland (Sutton, \u00a319.99) which sought to portray Nero in a better light than usual: musically gifted, spendthrift and a would-be superstar, he emerged as a kind of Roman Elton John.</p> <p><strong>Michael Foot</strong></p> <p>Writer and former Labour leader <br></p> <p> William Hazlitt's self-portrait peers out from the cover of A C Grayling's The Quarrel of the Age (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, \u00a325) - a good way indeed to make the bid for book of the year. To produce a work worthy of that picture is a fierce challenge. Dr Grayling understands the greatness of Hazlitt both as a thinker and a writer. He was the truest voice of the revolutionary spirit of his age. And since that prophesy is not yet fulfilled, Hazlitt seeks to instruct our century even more potently than his own.</p> <p><strong>Melvyn Bragg</strong></p> <p>Writer and broadcaster<br></p> <p> I have written elsewhere about my admiration for Frank Kermode's Shakespeare's Language (Allen Lane, \u00a320) and Alan Jenkins's The Drift (Chatto and Windus, \u00a38.99). Jenkins's moving, clear-eyed portrayal of a time in the life of himself and his family and makes this a very fine collection. I also found Martin Amis's Experience (Jonathan Cape, \u00a318) wholly intriguing in its richly detailed account of the relationships between his father and mother.</p> <p><strong>Max Stafford Clark</strong></p> <p>Director<br></p> <p> Stuart Browne's searing Dangerous Parking (Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99) is a robust and defiant novel about alcoholism and sex written in the face of the author's own struggle with cancer. It's brave and entertaining. But I was also educated by Ian McIntyre's biography, Garrick (Penguin, \u00a312.99), and intend to give it to Trevor Nunn for Christmas. Garrick was a great actor, but also the manager of Drury Lane Theatre, and his efforts to please patrons, fix salaries and above all find new plays that suited the taste of the town show that running a major theatrical institution has been a perennial impossibility.</p>",

Antony Sher Actor and writer I was a schoolboy in Cape Town in 1966 when Prime Minister Verwoerd was stabbed to death in parliament. In A Mouthful of Glass (Granta, \u00a312.99), Henk van Woerden has written a delicate, haunting biography of the assassin, Tsafendas, who was shunned by his family and kicked from country to country like junk because he was of mixed race. After the assassination he was certified mad. But are we born mad or do we have madness thrust upon us? Van Woerden's compassionate book addresses this question superbly. Angela Rippon Broadcaster I couldn't wait for He Shall Thunder in the Sky (US: Avon Books, $7.50), the 12th Amelia Peabody mystery from the pen of Elizabeth Peters, so I bought it on the internet and paid a fortune to have it shipped from America on publication day. The books are set in Egypt at the turn of the century and are funny, informative, engrossing and completely unputdownable, with a cast of characters that become real to the reader from the very first book in the series, Crocodile on the Sandbank. John Mortimer Writer Did Boswell invent Johnson, taking the author of some rather dull plays and pontificating journalism and and turning him into a fictional character as lovable and immortal as Falstaff or Micawber? This idea lies behind Adam Sisman's Boswell's Presumptuous Task (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a317.99). No doubt Johnson was a great old sage, but Boswell emerges as the man of today. Often vain, frequently insecure, constantly lecherous, but an honest observer of his own weaknesses -and splendid company. He and Johnson were lucky to have found each other and to provide the material for another constantly entertaining book. Rolf Harris Entertainer The Last English King by Julian Rathbone (Little, Brown, \u00a316.99) is about the time of King Harold, Edward the Confessor and William the Conqueror. It's a brilliant factual account in novel form which wonderfully explains what England was like before the Normans invaded. Robert Harris Novelist I have to confess, guiltily, to having immensely enjoyed the second volume of Alan Clark's diaries, Into Politics (Weidenfeld, \u00a320). It may not have been as good as the first, but there is something almost heroic about Clark's reckless self-obsession. Boswell's Presumptuous Task by Adam Sisman (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a317.99) succeeded triumphantly in focusing on one great human endeavour - the writing of the life of Samuel Johnson - and conjured from it a variety of insights into the nature of authorship, literary rivalry, fame, ambition, jealousy and friendship. I also much enjoyed Nero: The Man Behind the Myth by Richard Holland (Sutton, \u00a319.99) which sought to portray Nero in a better light than usual: musically gifted, spendthrift and a would-be superstar, he emerged as a kind of Roman Elton John. Michael Foot Writer and former Labour leader William Hazlitt's self-portrait peers out from the cover of A C Grayling's The Quarrel of the Age (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, \u00a325) - a good way indeed to make the bid for book of the year. To produce a work worthy of that picture is a fierce challenge. Dr Grayling understands the greatness of Hazlitt both as a thinker and a writer. He was the truest voice of the revolutionary spirit of his age. And since that prophesy is not yet fulfilled, Hazlitt seeks to instruct our century even more potently than his own. Melvyn Bragg Writer and broadcaster I have written elsewhere about my admiration for Frank Kermode's Shakespeare's Language (Allen Lane, \u00a320) and Alan Jenkins's The Drift (Chatto and Windus, \u00a38.99). Jenkins's moving, clear-eyed portrayal of a time in the life of himself and his family and makes this a very fine collection. I also found Martin Amis's Experience (Jonathan Cape, \u00a318) wholly intriguing in its richly detailed account of the relationships between his father and mother. Max Stafford Clark Director Stuart Browne's searing Dangerous Parking (Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99) is a robust and defiant novel about alcoholism and sex written in the face of the author's own struggle with cancer. It's brave and entertaining. But I was also educated by Ian McIntyre's biography, Garrick (Penguin, \u00a312.99), and intend to give it to Trevor Nunn for Christmas. Garrick was a great actor, but also the manager of Drury Lane Theatre, and his efforts to please patrons, fix salaries and above all find new plays that suited the taste of the town show that running a major theatrical institution has been a perennial impossibility.",

      "body": "<p>Peter Brook is an enigma. His productions, emanating from the Bouffes du Nord theatre complex in Paris, circle the globe. His writings on theatre, especially his pioneering book The Empty Space, have acquired canonical status. He is universally regarded, in the words of his friend Peter Hall, as \"the leading director of his generation\". Yet, although no one is more accessible, Brook remains strangely mysterious. Mick Gordon, one of his younger admirers who until recently ran London's Gate Theatre, describes him as \"religiously private\". </p> <p>The work is the key to the man. That certainly seems the view of Brook's children, Irina and Simon, offspring of his marriage to the actress, Natasha Parry. Both live in Paris and both are directors: Irina of plays and Simon of television documentaries. In February, Simon starts shooting a film for French television, and, with luck, the BBC, in which he tracks his father round the major theatrical capitals: London, Paris, New York. </p> <p>\"I will try to unlock his personality,\" says Simon, \"through getting him to talk about his past. One clue to him is that there is no sharp distinction between private and professional life. He has lots of interests, curiosities and friends, but everything feeds the work. He's certainly not the kind of man who goes to smart dinner-parties or fashionable restaurants.\" Peter Hall, who at 70 is five years younger than Brook, makes a similar point: \"he doesn't litter his life with irrelevancies.\" </p> <p>It would be wrong, however, to think of Brook as monkishly austere. Visit him in his office, at the top of a curving staircase in the Bouffes du Nord, and you find the space uncluttered, immaculate, but furnished with slightly more than the bare necessities: not only a state-of-the art CD player but a surprisingly large TV set. Does he actually watch much television? \"I live off CNN,\" he says, \"because it is irresistibly fascinating. And I've been glued to the American election crisis. It's actually Shakespearean because both Gore and Bush believe they're right. Bush and all his clan believe that he has honestly won according to the rules of the game. Yet Gore believes with equal sincerity that if every vote were to be recounted he has won. </p> <p>Given Brook's insatiable curiosity, it's no surprise to find he is fascinated by politics. He has an omnivorous mind. John Heilpern in The Conference Of The Birds, a classic study of an exploratory journey Brook took through Africa with a group of actors, writes: \"Apart from sport, almost anything interests him.\" And even Brook's mental block over sport has gradually begun to collapse. </p> <p>\"I always found,\" says Brook, \"there were two things I'd skip in the newspaper: the sports pages and the financial pages. Now, I read the finance pages because I find the extraordinary global convulsions of the markets as intriguing as nuclear physics. Similarly with sport. I got caught up in the wave of soccer enthusiasm following France's victory in the world cup.\" Comforting, somehow, to think of Brook curling up in front of the Gallic equivalent of Match of the Day. </p> <p>He becomes reticent only when questioned about the influence he has had on modern theatre. It is not just the productions from 1970's Midsummer Night's Dream onwards. The opening sentences of The Empty Space - originally delivered as a set of lectures and published in 1968 - have reverberated in theatres, makeshift and grand, across several continents: \"I can take any empty space and call it a bare stage. A man walks across this empty space, whilst someone else is watching him and this is all that is needed for an act of theatre to be engaged.\" </p> <p>Since Brook wrote that, the cumbersome trappings of conventional theatre have been discarded in basements and rooms all over the world: it is not all due to Brook, but he gave an accelerating historical movement an articulate voice. His emphasis on theatre as shared communal experience, rather than illusionist spectacle, has also had a decisive influence on a whole generation of directors. In Britain alone Deborah Warner, Declan Donnellan, Simon McBurney, Katie Mitchell and Mick Gordon are all, in a sense, Brook's children. </p> <p>But, although they have all attended Brook's workshops in Paris, he hates to be thought of as a teacher, guru or proselytising missionary. \"I'm wary,\" he says \"of talking about influences. Everyone influences everyone else. Today it's standard to say that my work here in Paris has become so simple. But I know this is the end of a long process. If anyone looking at that work were to start out by saying I'm going to be 'minimalist' and 'simple' then I would be a bad influence. </p> <p>\"An influence can be healthy when things become startling and important because done for the first time. When, for instance, someone first said 'fuck' on the stage, that was an important act of liberation. When people started putting Shakespeare into unlikely period costumes - such as Robert Helpmann's Victorian Hamlet at Stratford in the 40s - that too helped break the mould. What you find with time is that all those broken conventions and taboos gradually lose their power - today I see Shakespeare productions where people are still in the same uniforms Orson Welles was using for Julius Caesar - and that formal influences can be dangerously misunderstood. All that can valuably be passed on needs to be renewed by each generation.\" However much he denies it, Brook has had as profound an influence on British theatre as Brecht: on its spaces and structures as well as its style. And others acknowledge it even if he doesn't. Diana Rigg has spoken of his \"Svengali effect\". </p> <p>\"The great thing about him,\" says Peter Hall, \"is his capacity to go on reinventing himself. Don't forget that in the London theatre of the 40s and 50s he was the great post-war decorator. But I think his real legacy, since the move to Paris, is to have created a multi-racial company and to have brought theatre back to its absolute basics. We don't any longer go to the theatre to see a replica of the Titanic being sunk on stage. We can get that in the cinema. But if you have an actor holding a model of the Titanic in his hand and immersing it in water while actors express the grief and anguish of the event, then you have theatre. Peter's genius is to have seen that before anyone else.\" </p> <p>Mick Gordon, who directed the Brook-influenced Intimate Death at London's Gate theatre, concurs, while seeing that facile imitation is a pitfall. \"For my generation,\" he says, \"The Empty Space was a kind of Bible. The danger is that people think they just have to follow Brook's precepts. But easy is not the same as simple. It requires great life-experience to achieve Peter's kind of simplicity. His mastery lies in his relation with the actor in the present. What he tries to have is as naked a human being on stage as possible.\" </p> <p>Brook's stripped-down simplicity is the end-product of a long theatrical journey. But, if you search carefully, you can find hints of the later Brook in the early dazzling theatrical exhibitionist and even as far back as childhood. Brook's first stroke of luck was to be born, in Chiswick, west London, in 1925, into a highly intelligent immigrant family: as he lovingly describes them in his recent memoir, Threads Of Time, they take on the eccentric colouration of a family from a Stephen Poliakoff play. \"I had learned as a child that I was Jewish and Russian,\" he writes, \"but these words were abstract concepts to me; my impressions were deeply conditioned by England.\" </p> <p>Their name, Bryk, was anglicised by a Dover immigration officer. Brook's father, Latvian by birth, was a manufacturing chemist and amateur inventor: his mother, from a German region of the Baltic, had sacrifice medical ambitions to become a chemist herself. Brook's father had invented army field telephones during the first world war, wrote revolutionary articles for \u00e9migr\u00e9 journals and later built up a pharmaceutical business, while his mother had manufactured antidotes to poison gas. </p> <p>From his father Brook inherited energy and steel: from his mother his artistic temperament and capacity for reconciliation.But hints of the later Brook can be found in his fascination with the way things worked and in his precocious ability to see himself as the writer's collaborator. On his very first visit to the theatre as a toddler he cried loudly because he thought the painted frontcloth meant there'd be no movement. On his second visit, to the Chiswick Empire, he was disappointed because the actor playing Richard III was seen visibly breathing after his death. Only on his third visit, to JM Barrie's Dear Brutus, was he excited because he thought the doors and windows of the set all led to some magical world beyond. </p> <p>Even more revealing is that Brook's own first venture into directing came at the age of seven: a four-hour Hamlet staged for his parents in which he acted every part himself. He kept a notebook of the production, inscribing it, \"Hamlet by P Brook and W Shakespeare\". You could say that life has come full circle and taught him the value of modesty: in his current adaptation of Hamlet at the Bouffes du Nord, Shakespeare at least gets top billing. </p> <p>It was film, however, rather than theatre that fired the young Brook's imagination. He loathed his formal education at a variety of exclusive schools and seems to have learned most during a year in Switzerland with a misdiagnosed glandular complaint: he devoured books, especially detective stories, and became a keen filmgoer. Back in England he left school at 16, with audible relief, to write scripts for commercials: clearly, however, his Wellesian bravura ran somewhat ahead of his employers. John Heilpern in The Conference Of The Birds recounts a story about a rejected Brook ad. </p> <p>\"An amazingly sexy actress comes off stage and starts to take everything off - her clothes, her wig, her make-up, her eyelashes, her eyebrows, her wooden leg - until revealed before the camera is a wrinkled old hag who suddenly flashes a perfect smile. 'But these ,' she says, 'are all my own, thanks to Gibbs SR!'\" </p> <p>Brook's passion for cinema was requited more fully when he went up to Oxford in 1942. According to a contemporary: \"It was as if he'd come up by public request. Rather like a high-pressure executive arriving to take over a dying business.\" Brook quickly assumed control of the university film society and, raising \u00a3250 from friends, shot his own hour-long version of Sterne's Sentimental Journey. The whole project aroused the ire of the Magdalen College authorities and, to guarantee his Oxford survival, Brook was asked to sign a pledge that he would have nothing to do with theatre or cinema again. </p> <p>Of greater long-term significance was Brook's youthful chutzpah in visiting John Gielgud backstage at the Haymarket and asking if he could borrow some costumes from Love For Love for the film: with his usual impulsive generosity, Gielgud obliged, little knowing that his own faltering career would be redefined less than a decade later by Brook at Stratford in a landmark production of Measure For Measure in 1950. </p> <p>What is staggering is the speed of Brook's ascent through the British theatre. On coming down Oxford, he was soon directing Cocteau's The Infernal Machine at a London theatre club: \"I felt,\" says Brook, \"like a boy given a vast box of toys to play with and that the text was mine as well.\" By the age of 20 he was directing Shaw and Shakespeare at Birmingham Rep. A year later he was at Stratford where his Watteauesque Love's Labour's Lost stunned all who saw it: not least a young Peter Hall who thought it \"ravishingly beautiful\" and vowed on the spot that he himself would one day run the Stratford theatre. </p> <p>By 22 Brook had become director of productions at Covent Garden and learned to deal with the quirks of the operatic world. \"Let's pretend to obey him now,\" he overheard one famous singer say to another. \"Later on we can dictate.\" He also recalls that electricians would sometimes miss lighting cues because they were entranced by the music. \"I suddenly realised,\" he says \"how useful it is not to like what you are doing.\" </p> <p>Brook left Covent Garden as rapidly as he arrived: he was fired after a production of Salome in which Strauss's score came a poor second to Salvador Dali's eccentric, Alice in Wonderland-like designs. But, despite his reputation as an enfant terrible, from 1945 to 1960 Brook shuttled between London, Stratford, Paris and New York pursuing a hectic career that voluptuously embraced plays, musicals, operas and movies. He listed \"air travel\", as well as playing the piano and painting, as his hobbies in Who's Who. When the critic Kenneth Tynan met Brook in the 1940s he wrote: \"He is a small, sausage-shaped man: he looks edible, and one gets the notion that if one bit into him he would taste like fondant cream or preserved ginger... the eyes are tiny and deep-set - twinkling ice-picks... one feels he has never travelled anywhere on foot or on buses, but is wrapped up in silk and carried.\" </p> <p>Not everything in Brook's frenetic 15 years of cultural commuting was a success: his 1952 film of The Beggar's Opera was a resounding flop foundering on his vision of Macheath as a Hogarthian rakehell which conflicted with Laurence Olivier's view of him as a gentleman highwayman. But three years later the two men were reunited at Stratford in a sensational Titus Andronicus that restored a forgotten play to the modern stage.</p> <p> With its rape, amputation and cannibalism, the play seemed to anticipate Brook's later experiments in the Theatre of Cruelty, derived from the work of the French actor, poet and theoretician, Antonin Artaud. But, where Artaud envisaged a theatre in which the director was all- powerful, Brook, while designing the set and composing the music, worked in tandem with a great actor: together he and Olivier elevated a play that had always been thought of as bloodthirsty hackwork into a dry run for King Lear. </p> <p>Today, this period of Brook's career in which he was in love with the theatre of shock, sensation and exotic effect, is a distant folk-memory. But it is vital to recall it for a complete understanding of the man. Tynan wrote in 1953: \"Nobody could accuse Peter Brook of simplicity, though in the last year or so he has been straining every nerve to achieve it. He cooks with cream, blood and spices: bread-and-water addicts must look elsewhere.\" </p> <p>Tynan goes on to depict Brook as a scourge of the avant-garde: \"At the inaugural meeting of one highly progressive theatrical group, he rose and said that he was growing a little tired of people whose lives a chance visit to the Chinese theatre had changed. He had just returned from a trip to New York. 'What would happen to the Chinese theatre,' Brook wondered, 'if a Chinaman happened to drop in on Guys and Dolls?' The question came out magisterially, crisp as a biscuit and quite unanswerable.\" </p> <p>And yet there is more continuity than one may suppose between the pathfinding Brook of today and that earlier scourge of the progressive. Tynan's anecdote shows that Brook has always had the capacity to pose subversive questions about the nature of theatre. Stylistically, Brook was also constantly aware of the magical property of an empty space: he cites the ending of his Covent Garden Boris Godunov where the hero is left alone bewailing the cycle of Russian tyranny. And, on the personal level, he has always been a nomadic, rootless figure searching for a spiritual meaning to life. </p> <p>In 1951 he married a raven-haired, darkly beautiful actress of Russian origin, Natasha Parry. Fortunately she shares his wanderlust and their life together has taken them all over Europe, America, Asia and Africa. But the real revelation of Threads Of Time was that, even at the height of his commercial fame, Brook came under the spell of the Russian occult teacher, Gurdjieff, who has been variously described as a sage and a charlatan. To his followers, he was a wise man who sought for secret knowledge among the holy men of the east. </p> <p>While working for a silkily autocratic West End impresario like Binkie Beaumont, Brook was also attending regular group-encounter sessions in north London with a close-cropped American Gurdjieff disciple, Jane Heap. Brook is tantalisingly vague about what precisely he was searching for: he calls it simply \"something else\". But throughout his life sceptical pragmatism and mystical belief have been held in a delicate balance. He has also disclosed that for a time he experimented with hallucinogenic drugs. </p> <p>\"I swallowed a pill made from the Mexican mushroom,\" he wrote in his autobiography... \"it awoke an infinite sensibility just in the point of my index finger... had I penetrated to the heart of the fleeting moment?\" </p> <p>The turning-point in his professional life came in 1960 with the foundation of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Invited by Peter Hall to join as a co-director, Brook was able to create theatre in a more stable climate and with longer rehearsals: the first fruit was a famous, bare-stage King Lear that bore the imprint of both Brecht and Beckett and approached the play in a spirit of inquiring moral neutrality. </p> <p>Brook also displayed his private loyalty to Hall. \"He's one of my three or four closest friends,\" says Hall \"but if I had a normal crisis I wouldn't ring him. If I had a major crisis, then I would. When I had a complete breakdown during rehearsals of The Wars of the Roses in 1963 it was Peter who, along with my first wife and Peggy Ashcroft, was magnificent and who, in spite of the doctors' warnings, urged me to get back to work; and he was right.\" </p> <p>Hall matched Brook's loyalty. When the latter asked for time and money in 1964 to set up at a London drama school an experimental season called Theatre of Cruelty, based on Artaud's belief in a theatre that would give expression to the audience's dreams and obsessions, Hall instantly agreed; and the result, chiefly memorable for the sight of Glenda Jackson taking off her clothes and being garbed in the drab uniform of a female prisoner, was pivotal for Brook. \"This,\" he says, \"was the big turning-point: the moment when I realised that my ideal was not simply to mount existing texts but to explore the nature of theatre itself.\" </p> <p>This didn't stop him directing Peter Weiss's somewhat turgid debate about political and sexual revolution, the Marat -Sade, and turning it in 1964 into an unforgettable physical spectacle. In 1970 he went on to create a celebrated airborne production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Viewing a clip of it on television today in Richard Eyre's Changing Stages series, Brook says: \"Thank God I resisted all the pressures of the time to make a film of it - that little fragment is far more evocative than if one had the whole thing pretending to be a permanent record.\" But even before The Dream it was clear that Brook was growingly impatient with British theatre's preoccupation with product rather than process. </p> <p>Tynan wrote prophetically: \"Phlegmatically, we await the Messiah. Let us pray that someone will buy him a theatre, give him a company of 20 actors... a permanent staff of playwrights and a free hand. Only by such benefactions are styles born and developed. All that is needed is \u00a3100,000 and the patience to to wait 10 years for effective results.\" But it was to be the French, rather than the British, who were to offer Brook the support and sanctuary his pioneering approach to theatre required. </p> <p>As Hall recalls: \"Peter came to me in 1966 and told me that he was trying to set up a research group in Paris. I begged him to stay here and do it under the umbrella of the RSC. I promised to do everything I could to fund it. He said 'It won't work. Research and development aren't accepted in the arts in Britain.' And he was right. But I still think he was a great loss to us.\" </p> <p>With hindsight, Brook's decision to move to Paris in 1970 and set up the International Centre for Theatre Research and eventually to take over a battered, crumbling shell of a theatre, the Bouffes du Nord, was instinctively correct. It has given him creative freedom. It has enabled him to stage an astonishing body of public work starting with Timon of Athens in 1974 and continuing through The Conference Of The Birds, The Cherry Orchard, Carmen, The Mahabharata, The Man Who, and Le Costume, which comes to the Young Vic in January under the banner of the London International Festival of Theatre. </p> <p>Touring, in fact, is economically vital to the Bouffes: it is financed as much by its own foreign earnings as by the French ministry of culture. But Brook absolutely does the work he wants: which is why, as the critic Irving Wardle once pointed out, his productions follow an organic pattern, each giving birth to the next, in a way that is more common amongst writers than directors. Where once he imprinted himself on a play, Brook also now directs with an invisible thread. But admiration is by no means universal: The Mahabharata, in particular, was coolly received by many New York critics including Frank Rich of the New York Times who called it \"a smorgasbord of Oriental stagecraft\". And in Paris many of the young allegedly find Brook \"old-fashioned\" though they conspicuously pack out his theatre. </p> <p>Looking back, at the age of 75, Brook has no regrets about leaving England. \"I didn't,\" he says, \"take the decision dramatically. I didn't have any reason for feeling badly treated at home: I just knew that Paris would be more conducive to the kind of research work I wanted to do. And I honestly don't think I would today have the same freedom and tranquillity in England that I have here. When I look at all the pressures on people I know in England I'm appalled: the constant media spotlight, the preoccupation with who's in and out of fashion, the hassles over funding. I see what poor Trevor [Nunn] is going through at his moment and I feel grateful to be in Paris.\" </p> <p>Brook is anxious, however, to dispel the notion that he has found the holy grail or that the Bouffes is some kind of religious temple: in the end, it is a converted vaudeville and musical house that puts on shows. \"I don't believe, for one moment,\" he says, \"that theatre should be a substitute for religion. The ideal is to be able to link elements in the same way as in traditional societies the shoemaker makes his shoes and is not cut off from the person who goes to the mosque on Friday. The shoemaker doesn't go to the pantheistic point of thinking shoes are god and that, in fashioning them, he is fulfilling a spiritual exercise. One tries to keep a sense of proportion and make theatre as best one can. </p> <p>\"Theatre is not a monastery. Which is where my great friend, Grotowski, and I agreed to differ. He withdrew completely from performance and his last work was with six people created in monastic conditions and exhibited once a year. He was a great man who underwent a huge spiritual journey. I am making practical theatre as best I can. Which is why I did Woza Albert after The Mahabharata, and Le Costume immediately before Hamlet.\" </p> <p>Le Costume, a poetic South African fable set in 1950s Sophiatown, the Johannesburg black township, and dealing with a husband's strange revenge on his unfaithful wife, is Brook at his most buoyant. The Tragedy Of Hamlet, recently opened, is Brook at his most reflective: it is as if he finds in Hamlet's constant questioning an echo of his own spiritual restlessness. </p> <p>Professionally, it would be punningly easy to say the commercial showman turned into the art-house shaman: easy but wrong since the two have always been inextricably intertwined in Brook's career. On a personal level, Brook remains unknown except to close family and friends. He is horrified at the prospect of anyone writing his biography: he argues that no one would find his life remotely interesting. What he has chosen to disclose is there in Threads Of Time. All one can deduce is that he remains protectively loving towards his wife, Natasha - who plays Gertrude in Hamlet - and that he depends heavily for the organisation of his daily life on her sister, Nina: the Bouffes is very much a family business. But, in many ways, his most intimate friendship seems to be with his young amanuensis, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Estienne, who casts all his shows and who acts as his constant counsellor and artistic collaborator. </p> <p>Brook's children provide the most revealing glimpse of him. Irina, now 38 and a mother, recalls the sheer fun of being Peter Brook's daughter. \"The first production of his I saw was A Midsummer Night's Dream when I was about eight. I became a complete Dream groupie and backstage brat seeing it about 85 times and falling in love with all the boys and girls. Obviously, I had a nomadic childhood and I'd join my parents for Christmas in Africa, America or Iran or wherever. Peter was always travelling but he was far better than any normal father because he was so inventive and imaginative with children. He'd tell marvellous stories or find funny ways of giving presents by following arrows or inventing quizzes.\" </p> <p>The 34-year-old Simon also feels that the inevitable absences were more than made up for by the vitality of Brook's presence. \"He couldn't have been a better father,\" says Simon \"in that he left me curious about everything. I suppose what I've learned from him in making documentaries is never to arrive with preconceived ideas: the importance of not imposing a form from the outside but of discovering the form that is there. I recently was in Ethiopia and made a film about a tribe who take a root and place it in a muddy stream and thereby clarify the water. I think that's very much how Peter works. He takes what was previously opaque and obscure and makes it seem transparent.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance:</strong> Peter Stephen Paul Brook. </p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> March 1, 1925. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Westminster, Gresham's 1936-41.

      "bodyText": "Peter Brook is an enigma. His productions, emanating from the Bouffes du Nord theatre complex in Paris, circle the globe. His writings on theatre, especially his pioneering book The Empty Space, have acquired canonical status. He is universally regarded, in the words of his friend Peter Hall, as \"the leading director of his generation\". Yet, although no one is more accessible, Brook remains strangely mysterious. Mick Gordon, one of his younger admirers who until recently ran London's Gate Theatre, describes him as \"religiously private\". The work is the key to the man. That certainly seems the view of Brook's children, Irina and Simon, offspring of his marriage to the actress, Natasha Parry. Both live in Paris and both are directors: Irina of plays and Simon of television documentaries. In February, Simon starts shooting a film for French television, and, with luck, the BBC, in which he tracks his father round the major theatrical capitals: London, Paris, New York. \"I will try to unlock his personality,\" says Simon, \"through getting him to talk about his past. One clue to him is that there is no sharp distinction between private and professional life. He has lots of interests, curiosities and friends, but everything feeds the work. He's certainly not the kind of man who goes to smart dinner-parties or fashionable restaurants.\" Peter Hall, who at 70 is five years younger than Brook, makes a similar point: \"he doesn't litter his life with irrelevancies.\" It would be wrong, however, to think of Brook as monkishly austere. Visit him in his office, at the top of a curving staircase in the Bouffes du Nord, and you find the space uncluttered, immaculate, but furnished with slightly more than the bare necessities: not only a state-of-the art CD player but a surprisingly large TV set. Does he actually watch much television? \"I live off CNN,\" he says, \"because it is irresistibly fascinating. And I've been glued to the American election crisis. It's actually Shakespearean because both Gore and Bush believe they're right. Bush and all his clan believe that he has honestly won according to the rules of the game. Yet Gore believes with equal sincerity that if every vote were to be recounted he has won. Given Brook's insatiable curiosity, it's no surprise to find he is fascinated by politics. He has an omnivorous mind. John Heilpern in The Conference Of The Birds, a classic study of an exploratory journey Brook took through Africa with a group of actors, writes: \"Apart from sport, almost anything interests him.\" And even Brook's mental block over sport has gradually begun to collapse. \"I always found,\" says Brook, \"there were two things I'd skip in the newspaper: the sports pages and the financial pages. Now, I read the finance pages because I find the extraordinary global convulsions of the markets as intriguing as nuclear physics. Similarly with sport. I got caught up in the wave of soccer enthusiasm following France's victory in the world cup.\" Comforting, somehow, to think of Brook curling up in front of the Gallic equivalent of Match of the Day. He becomes reticent only when questioned about the influence he has had on modern theatre. It is not just the productions from 1970's Midsummer Night's Dream onwards. The opening sentences of The Empty Space - originally delivered as a set of lectures and published in 1968 - have reverberated in theatres, makeshift and grand, across several continents: \"I can take any empty space and call it a bare stage. A man walks across this empty space, whilst someone else is watching him and this is all that is needed for an act of theatre to be engaged.\" Since Brook wrote that, the cumbersome trappings of conventional theatre have been discarded in basements and rooms all over the world: it is not all due to Brook, but he gave an accelerating historical movement an articulate voice. His emphasis on theatre as shared communal experience, rather than illusionist spectacle, has also had a decisive influence on a whole generation of directors. In Britain alone Deborah Warner, Declan Donnellan, Simon McBurney, Katie Mitchell and Mick Gordon are all, in a sense, Brook's children. But, although they have all attended Brook's workshops in Paris, he hates to be thought of as a teacher, guru or proselytising missionary. \"I'm wary,\" he says \"of talking about influences. Everyone influences everyone else. Today it's standard to say that my work here in Paris has become so simple. But I know this is the end of a long process. If anyone looking at that work were to start out by saying I'm going to be 'minimalist' and 'simple' then I would be a bad influence. \"An influence can be healthy when things become startling and important because done for the first time. When, for instance, someone first said 'fuck' on the stage, that was an important act of liberation. When people started putting Shakespeare into unlikely period costumes - such as Robert Helpmann's Victorian Hamlet at Stratford in the 40s - that too helped break the mould. What you find with time is that all those broken conventions and taboos gradually lose their power - today I see Shakespeare productions where people are still in the same uniforms Orson Welles was using for Julius Caesar - and that formal influences can be dangerously misunderstood. All that can valuably be passed on needs to be renewed by each generation.\" However much he denies it, Brook has had as profound an influence on British theatre as Brecht: on its spaces and structures as well as its style. And others acknowledge it even if he doesn't. Diana Rigg has spoken of his \"Svengali effect\". \"The great thing about him,\" says Peter Hall, \"is his capacity to go on reinventing himself. Don't forget that in the London theatre of the 40s and 50s he was the great post-war decorator. But I think his real legacy, since the move to Paris, is to have created a multi-racial company and to have brought theatre back to its absolute basics. We don't any longer go to the theatre to see a replica of the Titanic being sunk on stage. We can get that in the cinema. But if you have an actor holding a model of the Titanic in his hand and immersing it in water while actors express the grief and anguish of the event, then you have theatre. Peter's genius is to have seen that before anyone else.\" Mick Gordon, who directed the Brook-influenced Intimate Death at London's Gate theatre, concurs, while seeing that facile imitation is a pitfall. \"For my generation,\" he says, \"The Empty Space was a kind of Bible. The danger is that people think they just have to follow Brook's precepts. But easy is not the same as simple. It requires great life-experience to achieve Peter's kind of simplicity. His mastery lies in his relation with the actor in the present. What he tries to have is as naked a human being on stage as possible.\" Brook's stripped-down simplicity is the end-product of a long theatrical journey. But, if you search carefully, you can find hints of the later Brook in the early dazzling theatrical exhibitionist and even as far back as childhood. Brook's first stroke of luck was to be born, in Chiswick, west London, in 1925, into a highly intelligent immigrant family: as he lovingly describes them in his recent memoir, Threads Of Time, they take on the eccentric colouration of a family from a Stephen Poliakoff play. \"I had learned as a child that I was Jewish and Russian,\" he writes, \"but these words were abstract concepts to me; my impressions were deeply conditioned by England.\" Their name, Bryk, was anglicised by a Dover immigration officer. Brook's father, Latvian by birth, was a manufacturing chemist and amateur inventor: his mother, from a German region of the Baltic, had sacrifice medical ambitions to become a chemist herself. Brook's father had invented army field telephones during the first world war, wrote revolutionary articles for \u00e9migr\u00e9 journals and later built up a pharmaceutical business, while his mother had manufactured antidotes to poison gas. From his father Brook inherited energy and steel: from his mother his artistic temperament and capacity for reconciliation.But hints of the later Brook can be found in his fascination with the way things worked and in his precocious ability to see himself as the writer's collaborator. On his very first visit to the theatre as a toddler he cried loudly because he thought the painted frontcloth meant there'd be no movement. On his second visit, to the Chiswick Empire, he was disappointed because the actor playing Richard III was seen visibly breathing after his death. Only on his third visit, to JM Barrie's Dear Brutus, was he excited because he thought the doors and windows of the set all led to some magical world beyond. Even more revealing is that Brook's own first venture into directing came at the age of seven: a four-hour Hamlet staged for his parents in which he acted every part himself. He kept a notebook of the production, inscribing it, \"Hamlet by P Brook and W Shakespeare\". You could say that life has come full circle and taught him the value of modesty: in his current adaptation of Hamlet at the Bouffes du Nord, Shakespeare at least gets top billing. It was film, however, rather than theatre that fired the young Brook's imagination. He loathed his formal education at a variety of exclusive schools and seems to have learned most during a year in Switzerland with a misdiagnosed glandular complaint: he devoured books, especially detective stories, and became a keen filmgoer. Back in England he left school at 16, with audible relief, to write scripts for commercials: clearly, however, his Wellesian bravura ran somewhat ahead of his employers. John Heilpern in The Conference Of The Birds recounts a story about a rejected Brook ad. \"An amazingly sexy actress comes off stage and starts to take everything off - her clothes, her wig, her make-up, her eyelashes, her eyebrows, her wooden leg - until revealed before the camera is a wrinkled old hag who suddenly flashes a perfect smile. 'But these ,' she says, 'are all my own, thanks to Gibbs SR!'\" Brook's passion for cinema was requited more fully when he went up to Oxford in 1942. According to a contemporary: \"It was as if he'd come up by public request. Rather like a high-pressure executive arriving to take over a dying business.\" Brook quickly assumed control of the university film society and, raising \u00a3250 from friends, shot his own hour-long version of Sterne's Sentimental Journey. The whole project aroused the ire of the Magdalen College authorities and, to guarantee his Oxford survival, Brook was asked to sign a pledge that he would have nothing to do with theatre or cinema again. Of greater long-term significance was Brook's youthful chutzpah in visiting John Gielgud backstage at the Haymarket and asking if he could borrow some costumes from Love For Love for the film: with his usual impulsive generosity, Gielgud obliged, little knowing that his own faltering career would be redefined less than a decade later by Brook at Stratford in a landmark production of Measure For Measure in 1950. What is staggering is the speed of Brook's ascent through the British theatre. On coming down Oxford, he was soon directing Cocteau's The Infernal Machine at a London theatre club: \"I felt,\" says Brook, \"like a boy given a vast box of toys to play with and that the text was mine as well.\" By the age of 20 he was directing Shaw and Shakespeare at Birmingham Rep. A year later he was at Stratford where his Watteauesque Love's Labour's Lost stunned all who saw it: not least a young Peter Hall who thought it \"ravishingly beautiful\" and vowed on the spot that he himself would one day run the Stratford theatre. By 22 Brook had become director of productions at Covent Garden and learned to deal with the quirks of the operatic world. \"Let's pretend to obey him now,\" he overheard one famous singer say to another. \"Later on we can dictate.\" He also recalls that electricians would sometimes miss lighting cues because they were entranced by the music. \"I suddenly realised,\" he says \"how useful it is not to like what you are doing.\" Brook left Covent Garden as rapidly as he arrived: he was fired after a production of Salome in which Strauss's score came a poor second to Salvador Dali's eccentric, Alice in Wonderland-like designs. But, despite his reputation as an enfant terrible, from 1945 to 1960 Brook shuttled between London, Stratford, Paris and New York pursuing a hectic career that voluptuously embraced plays, musicals, operas and movies. He listed \"air travel\", as well as playing the piano and painting, as his hobbies in Who's Who. When the critic Kenneth Tynan met Brook in the 1940s he wrote: \"He is a small, sausage-shaped man: he looks edible, and one gets the notion that if one bit into him he would taste like fondant cream or preserved ginger... the eyes are tiny and deep-set - twinkling ice-picks... one feels he has never travelled anywhere on foot or on buses, but is wrapped up in silk and carried.\" Not everything in Brook's frenetic 15 years of cultural commuting was a success: his 1952 film of The Beggar's Opera was a resounding flop foundering on his vision of Macheath as a Hogarthian rakehell which conflicted with Laurence Olivier's view of him as a gentleman highwayman. But three years later the two men were reunited at Stratford in a sensational Titus Andronicus that restored a forgotten play to the modern stage. With its rape, amputation and cannibalism, the play seemed to anticipate Brook's later experiments in the Theatre of Cruelty, derived from the work of the French actor, poet and theoretician, Antonin Artaud. But, where Artaud envisaged a theatre in which the director was all- powerful, Brook, while designing the set and composing the music, worked in tandem with a great actor: together he and Olivier elevated a play that had always been thought of as bloodthirsty hackwork into a dry run for King Lear. Today, this period of Brook's career in which he was in love with the theatre of shock, sensation and exotic effect, is a distant folk-memory. But it is vital to recall it for a complete understanding of the man. Tynan wrote in 1953: \"Nobody could accuse Peter Brook of simplicity, though in the last year or so he has been straining every nerve to achieve it. He cooks with cream, blood and spices: bread-and-water addicts must look elsewhere.\" Tynan goes on to depict Brook as a scourge of the avant-garde: \"At the inaugural meeting of one highly progressive theatrical group, he rose and said that he was growing a little tired of people whose lives a chance visit to the Chinese theatre had changed. He had just returned from a trip to New York. 'What would happen to the Chinese theatre,' Brook wondered, 'if a Chinaman happened to drop in on Guys and Dolls?' The question came out magisterially, crisp as a biscuit and quite unanswerable.\" And yet there is more continuity than one may suppose between the pathfinding Brook of today and that earlier scourge of the progressive. Tynan's anecdote shows that Brook has always had the capacity to pose subversive questions about the nature of theatre. Stylistically, Brook was also constantly aware of the magical property of an empty space: he cites the ending of his Covent Garden Boris Godunov where the hero is left alone bewailing the cycle of Russian tyranny. And, on the personal level, he has always been a nomadic, rootless figure searching for a spiritual meaning to life. In 1951 he married a raven-haired, darkly beautiful actress of Russian origin, Natasha Parry. Fortunately she shares his wanderlust and their life together has taken them all over Europe, America, Asia and Africa. But the real revelation of Threads Of Time was that, even at the height of his commercial fame, Brook came under the spell of the Russian occult teacher, Gurdjieff, who has been variously described as a sage and a charlatan. To his followers, he was a wise man who sought for secret knowledge among the holy men of the east. While working for a silkily autocratic West End impresario like Binkie Beaumont, Brook was also attending regular group-encounter sessions in north London with a close-cropped American Gurdjieff disciple, Jane Heap. Brook is tantalisingly vague about what precisely he was searching for: he calls it simply \"something else\". But throughout his life sceptical pragmatism and mystical belief have been held in a delicate balance. He has also disclosed that for a time he experimented with hallucinogenic drugs. \"I swallowed a pill made from the Mexican mushroom,\" he wrote in his autobiography... \"it awoke an infinite sensibility just in the point of my index finger... had I penetrated to the heart of the fleeting moment?\" The turning-point in his professional life came in 1960 with the foundation of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Invited by Peter Hall to join as a co-director, Brook was able to create theatre in a more stable climate and with longer rehearsals: the first fruit was a famous, bare-stage King Lear that bore the imprint of both Brecht and Beckett and approached the play in a spirit of inquiring moral neutrality. Brook also displayed his private loyalty to Hall. \"He's one of my three or four closest friends,\" says Hall \"but if I had a normal crisis I wouldn't ring him. If I had a major crisis, then I would. When I had a complete breakdown during rehearsals of The Wars of the Roses in 1963 it was Peter who, along with my first wife and Peggy Ashcroft, was magnificent and who, in spite of the doctors' warnings, urged me to get back to work; and he was right.\" Hall matched Brook's loyalty. When the latter asked for time and money in 1964 to set up at a London drama school an experimental season called Theatre of Cruelty, based on Artaud's belief in a theatre that would give expression to the audience's dreams and obsessions, Hall instantly agreed; and the result, chiefly memorable for the sight of Glenda Jackson taking off her clothes and being garbed in the drab uniform of a female prisoner, was pivotal for Brook. \"This,\" he says, \"was the big turning-point: the moment when I realised that my ideal was not simply to mount existing texts but to explore the nature of theatre itself.\" This didn't stop him directing Peter Weiss's somewhat turgid debate about political and sexual revolution, the Marat -Sade, and turning it in 1964 into an unforgettable physical spectacle. In 1970 he went on to create a celebrated airborne production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Viewing a clip of it on television today in Richard Eyre's Changing Stages series, Brook says: \"Thank God I resisted all the pressures of the time to make a film of it - that little fragment is far more evocative than if one had the whole thing pretending to be a permanent record.\" But even before The Dream it was clear that Brook was growingly impatient with British theatre's preoccupation with product rather than process. Tynan wrote prophetically: \"Phlegmatically, we await the Messiah. Let us pray that someone will buy him a theatre, give him a company of 20 actors... a permanent staff of playwrights and a free hand. Only by such benefactions are styles born and developed. All that is needed is \u00a3100,000 and the patience to to wait 10 years for effective results.\" But it was to be the French, rather than the British, who were to offer Brook the support and sanctuary his pioneering approach to theatre required. As Hall recalls: \"Peter came to me in 1966 and told me that he was trying to set up a research group in Paris. I begged him to stay here and do it under the umbrella of the RSC. I promised to do everything I could to fund it. He said 'It won't work. Research and development aren't accepted in the arts in Britain.' And he was right. But I still think he was a great loss to us.\" With hindsight, Brook's decision to move to Paris in 1970 and set up the International Centre for Theatre Research and eventually to take over a battered, crumbling shell of a theatre, the Bouffes du Nord, was instinctively correct. It has given him creative freedom. It has enabled him to stage an astonishing body of public work starting with Timon of Athens in 1974 and continuing through The Conference Of The Birds, The Cherry Orchard, Carmen, The Mahabharata, The Man Who, and Le Costume, which comes to the Young Vic in January under the banner of the London International Festival of Theatre. Touring, in fact, is economically vital to the Bouffes: it is financed as much by its own foreign earnings as by the French ministry of culture. But Brook absolutely does the work he wants: which is why, as the critic Irving Wardle once pointed out, his productions follow an organic pattern, each giving birth to the next, in a way that is more common amongst writers than directors. Where once he imprinted himself on a play, Brook also now directs with an invisible thread. But admiration is by no means universal: The Mahabharata, in particular, was coolly received by many New York critics including Frank Rich of the New York Times who called it \"a smorgasbord of Oriental stagecraft\". And in Paris many of the young allegedly find Brook \"old-fashioned\" though they conspicuously pack out his theatre. Looking back, at the age of 75, Brook has no regrets about leaving England. \"I didn't,\" he says, \"take the decision dramatically. I didn't have any reason for feeling badly treated at home: I just knew that Paris would be more conducive to the kind of research work I wanted to do. And I honestly don't think I would today have the same freedom and tranquillity in England that I have here. When I look at all the pressures on people I know in England I'm appalled: the constant media spotlight, the preoccupation with who's in and out of fashion, the hassles over funding. I see what poor Trevor [Nunn] is going through at his moment and I feel grateful to be in Paris.\" Brook is anxious, however, to dispel the notion that he has found the holy grail or that the Bouffes is some kind of religious temple: in the end, it is a converted vaudeville and musical house that puts on shows. \"I don't believe, for one moment,\" he says, \"that theatre should be a substitute for religion. The ideal is to be able to link elements in the same way as in traditional societies the shoemaker makes his shoes and is not cut off from the person who goes to the mosque on Friday. The shoemaker doesn't go to the pantheistic point of thinking shoes are god and that, in fashioning them, he is fulfilling a spiritual exercise. One tries to keep a sense of proportion and make theatre as best one can. \"Theatre is not a monastery. Which is where my great friend, Grotowski, and I agreed to differ. He withdrew completely from performance and his last work was with six people created in monastic conditions and exhibited once a year. He was a great man who underwent a huge spiritual journey. I am making practical theatre as best I can. Which is why I did Woza Albert after The Mahabharata, and Le Costume immediately before Hamlet.\" Le Costume, a poetic South African fable set in 1950s Sophiatown, the Johannesburg black township, and dealing with a husband's strange revenge on his unfaithful wife, is Brook at his most buoyant. The Tragedy Of Hamlet, recently opened, is Brook at his most reflective: it is as if he finds in Hamlet's constant questioning an echo of his own spiritual restlessness. Professionally, it would be punningly easy to say the commercial showman turned into the art-house shaman: easy but wrong since the two have always been inextricably intertwined in Brook's career. On a personal level, Brook remains unknown except to close family and friends. He is horrified at the prospect of anyone writing his biography: he argues that no one would find his life remotely interesting. What he has chosen to disclose is there in Threads Of Time. All one can deduce is that he remains protectively loving towards his wife, Natasha - who plays Gertrude in Hamlet - and that he depends heavily for the organisation of his daily life on her sister, Nina: the Bouffes is very much a family business. But, in many ways, his most intimate friendship seems to be with his young amanuensis, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Estienne, who casts all his shows and who acts as his constant counsellor and artistic collaborator. Brook's children provide the most revealing glimpse of him. Irina, now 38 and a mother, recalls the sheer fun of being Peter Brook's daughter. \"The first production of his I saw was A Midsummer Night's Dream when I was about eight. I became a complete Dream groupie and backstage brat seeing it about 85 times and falling in love with all the boys and girls. Obviously, I had a nomadic childhood and I'd join my parents for Christmas in Africa, America or Iran or wherever. Peter was always travelling but he was far better than any normal father because he was so inventive and imaginative with children. He'd tell marvellous stories or find funny ways of giving presents by following arrows or inventing quizzes.\" The 34-year-old Simon also feels that the inevitable absences were more than made up for by the vitality of Brook's presence. \"He couldn't have been a better father,\" says Simon \"in that he left me curious about everything. I suppose what I've learned from him in making documentaries is never to arrive with preconceived ideas: the importance of not imposing a form from the outside but of discovering the form that is there. I recently was in Ethiopia and made a film about a tribe who take a root and place it in a muddy stream and thereby clarify the water. I think that's very much how Peter works. He takes what was previously opaque and obscure and makes it seem transparent.\" Life at a glance: Peter Stephen Paul Brook. Born: March 1, 1925. Education: Westminster, Gresham's 1936-41.

Fiona McTaggart, MP for Slough, offered a particularly poignant example of the dilemmas.

Second, and far more important, this change in the regulations is inextricably linked to the emotive cloning debate. Stem cell research on fertilised embryos prepares the way for therapeutic cloning.

In these local authorities, one person may live in a house worth \u00a320,000 and another in a property worth \u00a339,000 - yet they are in the same band and pay the same tax, he explains. Locally that is seen as unfair. </p> <p>If homes throughout the country had all doubled in price over the past nine years it would be a simple matter to double the values of the bands, says Mr Beaumont. But in some local authorities prices have stagnated or even fallen and in others have risen steeply. \"If the prices in the south-east have doubled and only increased by 50% elsewhere then revaluing properties would result in people in the south-east paying more council tax.\" </p> <p>People become disenchanted with the system if they cannot relate the band they're in to property values, says Mr Schurder.

      "bodyText": "Riot police mobilised outside the Vatican last night as the Pope's meeting today with Austria's J\u00f6rg Haider sparked uproar in Italy. Hundreds of police will this morning seal off streets leading to St Peter's Square to block demonstrations for and against the far-right politician. An air of siege surrounded Pope John Paul II on the eve of one of the most controversial ceremonies of his papacy, in which Mr Haider heads a delegation to present an 81-year-old, 80ft fir tree from the Austrian province of Carinthia, of which he is governor. Leftwing activists, second world war partisans, Israel, gay groups and Italian politicians lobbied in vain for a last-minute cancellation. Vatican aides hinted that the Pope will try to reverse a public relations disaster by denouncing the anti-immigrant xenophobia associated with Mr Haider's Freedom party. Protesters will try to erect a six-by-four metre banner depicting the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz to block the view of the tree. The choice of Carinthia to donate this year's tree was made three years ago before Mr Haider became governor. In going ahead, the Vatican cited protocol and its policy of opening doors to everybody. Israel protested that the meeting risked legitimising a pariah shunned in Europe for bringing Nazi nostalgia into Vienna's government. The 80-year-old Pope's lifelong goal of healing wounds between Catholics and Jews became a highlight of this year's jubilee, or holy year, when he made a historic apology for church persecution. Seeking to check waves of protest, Vatican officials said the meeting was a pontifical audience rather than a formal meeting of heads of state. The Pope would preach respect for human rights and tolerance, as he did when he met the then South African president, PW Botha, in the 1980s. The World Jewish Congress was not impressed. \"It is clear that the Pope will not specifically denounce Mr Haider's racist attitudes but just make general comments. The meeting between the two represents a moral and historical failure on the part of the Vatican.\" Mr Haider, who is a Roman Catholic, will be received in a morning audience as civil head of the 250-strong Carinthian delegation, including a choir and brass band that will perform during the afternoon lighting of the tree which has been under guard since arriving in a police convoy earlier last week. Before catching a flight to Rome, Mr Haider promised to show \"hysterical communists\" that he was an \"angel of peace\". He met the Pope in 1993. Urging Austria to veto proposed EU guidelines on family reunification and a unified European asylum law, he stirred a diplomatic storm by saying Italy was being too generous in allowing in immigrants and refugees. President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi denounced the attack, while prime minister Giuliano Amato wrote a protest letter to the Austrian chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel. Italy's centre-right opposition, led by Silvio Berlusconi, scrambled to distance itself from any association with Mr Haider. \"It has nothing to do with us,\" said Mr Berlusconi. Mr Haider, whose entry into Austria's government led to sanctions by EU partners, has turned Italy into a second political front in the past year. He has started Italian lessons, made at least five visits and courted sympathetic local politicians in the northeast, mortifying their leaders. Over the past few days, leftwing groups have held torch-lit protests in Rome, carried banners saying \"Haider, Rome doesn't forget\", and showered the Pope's car with leaflets depicting the fir tree as a gallows. A light aircraft trailing other slogans has allegedly been hired to buzz the Vatican today.",

      "body": "<p><strong> 7am, Tuesday September 11 1973</strong> <br> The fresh spring chill in the air and the blossoming jacaranda made that Chilean morning glorious. I stood in the yard of my friend Melvin's house in Santiago and glanced at the lingering snowcaps on the Andes. I had got up early because my Chilean residency visa expired that day and I needed to renew it. For a year now I had been working as a translator to Salvador Allende and I was scheduled to travel with him the next week. </p> <p>An early start was imperative. Taxis had become harder to come by as many of the cab companies had joined the work stoppage led by the truckers' association - a group floated with CIA dollars. Retail merchants, doctors, lawyers, and almost everyone more elevated than manual workers and farmers had joined the stoppage. In daily entreaties, they pleaded with the armed forces to do away with the popularly-elected President Allende. </p> <p>Indeed, Chile had already pitched itself into a dizzying dance of chaos and blood. As Allende's reforms deepened, as he nationalised the American copper mines and the telephone company, as large rural estates were handed over to their sharecroppers, as wages soared and taxes on the rich increased, the political right and eventually the centre jettisoned their attachment to the rule of law. </p> <p>Opposition groups fielded chain swinging thugs. Oil pipelines were dynamited. Industrial production was sabotaged. Just a week previous to this morning, on September 4, the Chilean left held its last great gathering to commemorate the third anniversary of Allende's election. While the president stood granite-faced on a balcony, more than half a million Chilean workers marched before him chanting: \"We want guns! We want guns!\" It was a horrible, wrenching moment, one permanently seared in my consciousness. Yes, guns. But what guns? From where? My friends and I walked home that evening with a dark foreboding. The end was surely near. </p> <p>In the seven days that followed, the right drew the noose tighter. Commerce and transport ground to a halt. The night before September 11, the transport stoppage had waylaid me and my girlfriend at Melvin's. We had gone out as a foursome, wound up snacking at Melvin's, and got stranded without a way back to my apartment. </p> <p>After an hour-long wait on the corner I was able to flag down a passing cab. \"Can you take me downtown to the immigration office?\" I asked. The cabbie replied: \"But, sir, there are problems downtown.\" </p> <p>These were highly polarised times. You never knew who you were talking to. But a sinking feeling in my gut told me the worst was upon us. I asked: \"Problems with men in uniform you mean?\" </p> <p>\"Yes, sir, problems with men in uniform,\" the cabbie said. He took what he probably knew would be his last foray into freedom for some time and added: \"Yes, the fucking fascists are overthrowing the government.\" </p> <p><strong> 7.55am, Tuesday September 11</strong> <br> Everyone else in the house was still asleep. I switched on the radio: virtually every station was playing the same military march. I stopped the dial on Radio Corporaci\u00f3n, the station of the Socialist party. Allende was speaking, a nervous inflection in his voice: \"This is the president of the republic speaking from La Moneda palace. Confirmed reports indicate that a sector of the navy has isolated and occupied the port city of Valparaiso, which means an uprising against the government is under way . . . Under these circumstances, I call upon the workers of the country to occupy your workplaces . . . but I urge you to stay calm . . . I am here defending the government that represents the will of the people...\" </p> <p>On just about every other radio station a stern-voiced announcer suddenly materialised. By order of the military junta, he said all stations were immediately to link up to the armed forces network or \"they will be bombarded\". The names of the four commanders making up the junta were then read: leading the national police was a general, C\u00e9sar Mendoza; for the air force, Gustavo Leigh; for the navy, Admiral Jos\u00e9 Merino; and for the army, General Augusto Pinochet. Pinochet had two weeks earlier taken over as commander-in-chief, swearing his loyalty to the president he was now trying to overthrow. </p> <p>Some more marches. And then another announcement. An ultimatum to Allende. I sat shaking as military communique number two was announced: \"The Moneda palace must be evacuated before 11am otherwise it will be attacked by the Chilean air force. The workers must remain in their workplaces and homes... If they disobey, they will also be attacked...\" </p> <p>I sat paralysed. A few moments later came communique number three: \"The population is hereby warned not to let themselves be carried away by incitements to violence from either foreign or national activists... Any resistance will be met with the full rigour of military justice.\" </p> <p>Yet another announcement proclaimed a curfew \"until further notice\". Anyone found on the streets \"will be shot on sight\". I had roused the others. We sat dumbfounded in the living room listening to Radio Magallanes, the Communist party station, resisting the order to broadcast the armed forces network. Over the air, workers were being urged to report to their factories and organise defence committees. But we knew this was an empty gesture. </p> <p><strong> 10am, Tuesday September 11</strong> <br> I had had virtually no contact with the US embassy, up on the 14th floor of an office building opposite the Moneda. But I phoned that morning hoping that some safety provisions were being made for resident Americans. </p> <p>I figured it was only a matter of hours before I would be swept up in the military dragnet. The embassy phone answered on the first ring. When I asked if the embassy had issued any special instructions, my respondent only laughed: \"No special orders. Just stay off the streets.\" And then she added: \"I'm looking out the window now with binoculars. Looks like Mr Allende is finally going to get it.\" She hung up. </p> <p><strong> 11am, Tuesday September 11</strong> <br> Allende's voice is coming live over Radio Magallanes. Via telephone, from inside the Moneda, with troops and tanks poised outside, Allende spoke: \"This is surely the last opportunity I will have to address you. The air force has bombed the towers of Radio Portales and Corporaci\u00f3n. My words are not bitter but they are full of disillusionment. And they will serve as moral sanction for those who have betrayed their oath of loyalty: the soldiers of Chile, the branch commanders... I can only say this to the workers. I will not resign... With my life I will pay for defending the principles dear to our nation... History cannot be stopped by repression or violence... Surely Radio Magallanes will be silenced and with it my voice. But that's of no importance. You will continue hearing me as I will always be by your side... You must know that, sooner rather than later, the grand avenues on which a free people walk will be open and a better society will be at hand... These are my last words...\" </p> <p>I sat stunned and devastated. I can only remember the four of us listening and sobbing for I don't know how long. We had no access to any information except what the military broadcast over the radio. The phone lines were now dead. </p> <p><strong> 4pm, Tuesday September 11</strong> <br> A non-stop cascade of military communiques: that the Moneda had been bombed, that the Allende government was no longer, that all political activity was banned, that a dawn-to-dusk curfew was in effect, that the citizenry should denounce all \"suspicious foreign ers\". I knew I was a prime target: Allende's translator, an activist in the radical wing of the Socialist party and a foreigner to boot. I thought of my apartment, in a downtown high rise located directly across the street from the new junta headquarters. On my desk were copies of the work I had translated for Allende. In my top drawer was my passport, a visa to Cuba which I was scheduled to visit with Allende, and to top it all off, a .22 revolver with a couple of boxes of ammunition. </p> <p><strong> Tuesday night to Thursday night, September 11 to 13</strong> <br> Those days were passed in the sort of blur produced by a state of deep shock. I didn't sleep that first night. I imagined Allende riddled and bloodied on his office floor. The following morning, an official communique announced that Allende had committed suicide. </p> <p>The resumption of Chilean TV. A wavering, black-and-white image of Pinochet sitting ramrod straight in the presidential chair, his accomplices standing beside him. I thought of the poor neighbourhoods and factories, now surrounded by vengeful troops. I wondered about my friends. How many would I ever see again? How long would it be before the troops came crashing through Melvin's door to take me away? </p> <p>On Wednesday a statement from the supreme court chief justice, Enrique Urrutia, affirming the court's \"pleasure\" with the military takeover. A terse military statement suspending habeas corpus and announcing a declared state of siege. Military communique number 29 dated September 13: \"On this date the government junta has decreed the following: the closure of the National Congress and the vacancy of all its parliamentary seats. Signed, the governing junta of the armed forces and carabineros of Chile.\" </p> <p>I remember getting up at four in the morning and shaving off my beard. I remember opening my wallet and taking out my union card, my Socialist party membership, my ID from the Moneda and setting them ablaze. </p> <p>The only food in the house was a freezer full of Eskimo pies, several sacks of onions and a case of Pisco liquor. This odd diet, peppered with fear, drove me into a feverish retreat. I could barely talk to my Chilean girlfriend, Patricia. I slept, I paced, ate ice cream, read novels, cried and waited. Lists of the wanted were read over the air: Allende's cabinet ministers, party activists, union leaders were ordered to surrender at the ministry of defence. How they were expected to breach the curfew without being shot was not explained. </p> <p><strong> 10am, Friday September 14</strong> <br> Melvin and his girlfriend have drunk themselves into a stupor. As the radio announces that the curfew will be lifted today for five hours, Patricia and I decide we must leave Melvin's. She had to check on her family. I had to figure a way to safety. </p> <p><strong> Noon, Friday September 14</strong> <br> I was now desperate. I focused on a long shot. An American friend of mine had told me some months before that a guy named Dennis Allred, who served as the US embassy's student affairs counsellor, was a decent man, who took secret delight in handing out US scholarships to the most radical of Chilean students. </p> <p>I phoned the embassy. Allred wasn't in. But, being an American, I could have his home phone number. \"Dennis, you don't know me,\" I told him after he answered his phone. \"But I'm an American and I'm in trouble. I need . . .\" </p> <p>\"OK,\" he said, cutting me short. \"I don't care about the details. If you need a place to stay you're welcome here. Come now. I'm at Merced 280.\" </p> <p>I thanked him and hung up. Merced 280? That would put him next door to the heavily guarded US consulate. Could I get past the troops? Patricia and I made a plan. She would catch a bus to her parents' home. I would walk the seven miles to Allred's house as I had no ID and buses were being boarded and checked by soldiers. </p> <p>By four o'clock I was on the perimeter of the US consulate. The neighbouring park was an armed camp. Armoured carriers bristled with machine guns and troops. In front of the consulate, a company of soldiers lounged on a tank. I could hear my heart beating. I walked straight ahead, my eyes fixed on the door of Allred's building. Like passing through a time warp, I floated in uninterrupted. </p> <p>A red-headed Bostoner, Allred greeted me alone in his apartment. I could hardly talk at first. And then I began to talk too much. \"I don't need to hear the details of your story. You can stay here as long as you have to,\" he said. He then offered me a tumbler full of Old Grandad which I gulped down like water. With a sleeping pill Allred gave me, I slept soundly for the first time in almost 100 hours. </p> <p><strong> 6pm, Sunday September 16</strong> <br> Over the weekend the apartment filled up with other hunted prey. A few had been beaten by troops who had broken down their doors. Others, like me, had nowhere to go. Allred had taken the courageous step of abandoning his direct-dial diplomatic phone to us. </p> <p>In Allred's study we set up a mini information clearing house. We called around to check on the safety of friends and co-workers. Once the information was compiled we were able to pass the information on to family, media and human rights groups in the US. Painstakingly, we cobbled together lists of those safe, those arrested and those missing. But there was still no way out of Chile. A friend of mine, a Mexican reporter, called me. Would I be interested in getting on a list that the Mexican embassy was putting together to be evacuated? \"Absolutely,\" I answered. </p> <p><strong> Noon, Monday September 17</strong> <br> Word had come that some Americans were missing. David Hathaway had been taken from his apartment. Frank Teruggi was unaccounted for. Some time that day, our friend Charlie Horman would be seized. I would next see Charlie and Frank a decade later, and then only as celluloid ghosts conjured up in the Costa Gavras film Missing. </p> <p>That afternoon, the whole apartment shook with a thud. From Allred's balcony we saw two tanks squatting in the park and shelling the fine arts campus of the University of Chile across the river. </p> <p><strong> 8pm, Tuesday September 18</strong> <br> One week since the coup, and the call came through from the Mexicans. I was to be on a flight organised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for the next morning. I was ecstatic at the thought I might get out but terrified that something might go wrong. I was also depressed, laden with survivor's guilt: my only prospect for joy was to flee the slaughterhouse of my friends. </p> <p><strong> 7am, Wednesday September 19</strong> <br> The moment the curfew was lifted, I called Patricia and asked her to meet me at the Sheraton. I hugged Allred goodbye. I walked past the encampment of soldiers outside Allred's door. On the corner, a daring taxi driver was ready for the post-curfew fares. Inside the Sheraton lobby I was met by UN and Mexican officials. There was to be about 50 of us on this flight. There were some Spanish clergy. Some Mexican teachers. An American researcher black and blue from a beating. A Texas high school swimming team that had passed through Santiago on the wrong day. </p> <p>Just before I boarded the bus to the airport Patricia arrived for a short goodbye - she would arrange to meet me later. Under heavily armed escort we were taken to the Cerrillos military airport. We were herded on to a 737. </p> <p>There was an eerie silence as we took off. No one was sure of anyone else on the flight. Twenty minutes into the flight, a crackling voice came over the intercom. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" the captain announced crisply. \"We have just entered Argentine air space.\" </p> <p>The entire plane exploded into yelps of joy and applause. Soon we were all on our feet embracing each other. We were greeted in Buenos Aires as heroes. And that night we marched with 100,000 Argentines to protest against the Chilean military dictatorship. </p> <p>Two months later, Patricia came to the US and we have been married ever since. Allred resigned from the US foreign service. </p> <p>In his final speech on Magallanes Radio, Allende promised us that one day there would be a \"moral punishment\" for the crime and treason that killed him and his Chile. We are still waiting. </p> <p>\u0095 Extracted from PINOCHET AND ME, a Chilean anti-memoir by Marc Cooper, published by Verso Publishers on 6 December 2000 at \u00a315. \u00a9 2000 Verso Publishers.</p>",

Two months later, Patricia came to the US and we have been married ever since. Allred resigned from the US foreign service. In his final speech on Magallanes Radio, Allende promised us that one day there would be a \"moral punishment\" for the crime and treason that killed him and his Chile. We are still waiting. \u0095 Extracted from PINOCHET AND ME, a Chilean anti-memoir by Marc Cooper, published by Verso Publishers on 6 December 2000 at \u00a315. \u00a9 2000 Verso Publishers.",

      "body": "<p>Beleaguered insurer <strong>Equitable Life</strong> created some excitement in the City yesterday. It is understood that the mutual insurer, which must sell off \u00a325bn in equities, began the process this week. It is likely to take months for all the stock to be sold but big names such as <strong>Vodafone</strong> and <strong>BP Amoco</strong> kicked off the rebalancing. </p> <p>The dealings by Equitable follow the decision to close its doors to new business last week when all its potential buyers pulled out. It needs to sell equities and replace them with bonds to reduce the risk in its \u00a333bn portfolio, so it can continue to pay the policies of existing customers. </p> <p>While Equitable's dealings, on which the insurer refused to comment, helped to boost turnover, they did little to hold up the market. The FTSE 100 lost another 88 points bringing it down to 6,175.8, its lowest close in nearly two weeks, heavily influenced by a poor Wall Street opening. </p> <p>According to analysts, the weakness stemmed from the United States and was spreading to the rest of the world. </p> <p>A profit warning from <strong>Microsoft</strong> led to <strong>IBM</strong> and <strong>Hewlett Packard</strong> falling. Bank, oil and pharmaceutical stocks were also weak. </p> <p><strong>HSBC</strong> slumped in Hong Kong trading, falling 48p to 938p and <strong>BP Amoco</strong> lost 9.5p to 533p. <strong>Shell</strong> dropped 9p to 509p. </p> <p>In pharmaceuticals, <strong>Nycomed Amersham</strong> fell 30p to 525p, <strong>Glaxo Wellcome</strong> 42p to 1943p and <strong>SmithKline Beecham</strong> lost 25p to 878p. </p> <p>Technology sectors continued to drop after declines in the tech-heavy Nasdaq market. <strong>Bookham Technology</strong> fell 115p to 1060p and <strong>Baltimore Technology</strong> lost 28p to 375p. </p> <p>Shares in <strong>Durlacher</strong> shed 7p to 22p after it gave warning that it expects to report a \"substantial loss\" for the six months to the end of December. The internet investment provider has seen its shares underperform its sector by 89% in 2000. </p> <p><strong>RTS Networks</strong> , the IT company, which reported a significant increase in second half revenues also saw its share price drop 7.5p to 45p. </p> <p>The company said fourth-quarter revenues would not be as high as previously anticipated. The group said it was undertaking larger projects that take longer for orders to come through, which would lead to higher revenues in the first quarter of next year. </p> <p><strong>Jarvis</strong>, the support services company, was up 11.25p to 191p, having started the week at 182p.

      "bodyText": "Beleaguered insurer Equitable Life created some excitement in the City yesterday. It is understood that the mutual insurer, which must sell off \u00a325bn in equities, began the process this week. It is likely to take months for all the stock to be sold but big names such as Vodafone and BP Amoco kicked off the rebalancing. The dealings by Equitable follow the decision to close its doors to new business last week when all its potential buyers pulled out. It needs to sell equities and replace them with bonds to reduce the risk in its \u00a333bn portfolio, so it can continue to pay the policies of existing customers. While Equitable's dealings, on which the insurer refused to comment, helped to boost turnover, they did little to hold up the market. The FTSE 100 lost another 88 points bringing it down to 6,175.8, its lowest close in nearly two weeks, heavily influenced by a poor Wall Street opening. According to analysts, the weakness stemmed from the United States and was spreading to the rest of the world. A profit warning from Microsoft led to IBM and Hewlett Packard falling. Bank, oil and pharmaceutical stocks were also weak. HSBC slumped in Hong Kong trading, falling 48p to 938p and BP Amoco lost 9.5p to 533p. Shell dropped 9p to 509p. In pharmaceuticals, Nycomed Amersham fell 30p to 525p, Glaxo Wellcome 42p to 1943p and SmithKline Beecham lost 25p to 878p. Technology sectors continued to drop after declines in the tech-heavy Nasdaq market. Bookham Technology fell 115p to 1060p and Baltimore Technology lost 28p to 375p. Shares in Durlacher shed 7p to 22p after it gave warning that it expects to report a \"substantial loss\" for the six months to the end of December. The internet investment provider has seen its shares underperform its sector by 89% in 2000. RTS Networks , the IT company, which reported a significant increase in second half revenues also saw its share price drop 7.5p to 45p. The company said fourth-quarter revenues would not be as high as previously anticipated. The group said it was undertaking larger projects that take longer for orders to come through, which would lead to higher revenues in the first quarter of next year. Jarvis, the support services company, was up 11.25p to 191p, having started the week at 182p. The increase is thought to be due to better than expected results announced this week, improved investor sentiment and anticipation that the company will benefit from increased government spending on infrastructure and education.

A joint venture plans to open 15 hypermarkets at a cost of \u00a3215m. Carrefour of France is the only other European operator in Malaysia.

This prompted tit-for-tat murders which spread to north Belfast.</p> <p>An 11-year-old girl, the daughter of a former paramilitary prisoner, was also badly injured when gunmen fired through the window of her home in Coleraine, Co Londonderry.</p> <p>Hundreds of Belfast families were forced to leave their homes, and many were sleeping on floors in relatives' homes and in church and community halls.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson who had urged both sides to make peace, said last night: \"I know from my extensive contacts with many people in the Shankill and north Belfast area that this is what they have been looking for for quite some time and I am deeply grateful, as they will be, to those who have worked so hard to bring this about.</p> <p>\"They have done a great service to their community and to the people of Northern Ireland.\"</p> <p>A Stormont assemblyman, David Ervine, whose Progressive Unionist Party speaks for the UVF and the Red Hand Commando, said: \"This statement has massive validity because of the length of time it took to get to this point. I'm convinced it will work.</p> <p>\"These communities have suffered enough and there is an indication in the statement the groups are cognisant of that. Genuine people have been working very hard to bring it to an end and, most fundamentally, create the circumstances in which it will never happen again.\"</p> <p>Gary McMichael, leader of the Ulster Democratic Party which represents the UDA and UFF, said the peace deal meant many families would sleep easier in their own beds this Christmas.</p> <p>\"Those in loyalist communities who could have had a very anxious Christmas will now be able to look forward and celebrate in peace and comfort,\" he said. \"All of us are glad the terrible suffering is now at an end.\"</p> <p>However, an Ulster Unionist councillor, Chris McGimpsey, said it would take months for displaced families to get back to normal. \"I welcome this and I hope any further disputes can be resolved through mediation rather than violence ... but even when families are rehoused there are all sorts of bureaucratic issues and problems,\" he said.</p>",

A statement from the Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Defence Association, whose members have been involved in a bitter battle on the Shankill Road and in the north of the city since the summer, said they were committed to an \"open-ended and all-encompassing cessation of hostilities\". It added: \"We fully recognise the pain and suffering that has been inflicted on our community and we resolve that under no circumstances will such events be repeated.\" The deal included the UVF's allies in the Red Hand Commando. Politicians on all sides welcomed the statement, which said that a series of mechanisms had been agreed at leadership and local levels in all three organisations to ensure disputes could be resolved in a peaceful way. The mainstream paramilitary groups, who support the Good Friday agreement, said they would disown any violence carried out in the name of dissident loyalists. \"Neither the Loyalist Volunteer Force nor any activity carried out under its name or any flag of convenience such as the Red Hand Defenders, Orange Volunteers or Loyalist Freedom Fighters has the support of any organisations bound by this agreement,\" they said. It is understood that Johnny Adair, the jailed Shankill Road boss of the Ulster Freedom Fighters, affliated to the UDA, was not involved in the peace talks which took place in secret for the past few months between the commanders of the loyalist organisations. The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, had revoked Adair's early release from prison in August because of his alleged influence in sparking the feud, and Mr Mandelson is to contest the sentence review commission's finding that he should be released soon. Trouble flared at a UDA band parade on the Shankill in August when several people were injured in a shooting in the Rex Bar. This prompted tit-for-tat murders which spread to north Belfast. An 11-year-old girl, the daughter of a former paramilitary prisoner, was also badly injured when gunmen fired through the window of her home in Coleraine, Co Londonderry. Hundreds of Belfast families were forced to leave their homes, and many were sleeping on floors in relatives' homes and in church and community halls. Mr Mandelson who had urged both sides to make peace, said last night: \"I know from my extensive contacts with many people in the Shankill and north Belfast area that this is what they have been looking for for quite some time and I am deeply grateful, as they will be, to those who have worked so hard to bring this about. \"They have done a great service to their community and to the people of Northern Ireland.\" A Stormont assemblyman, David Ervine, whose Progressive Unionist Party speaks for the UVF and the Red Hand Commando, said: \"This statement has massive validity because of the length of time it took to get to this point. I'm convinced it will work. \"These communities have suffered enough and there is an indication in the statement the groups are cognisant of that. Genuine people have been working very hard to bring it to an end and, most fundamentally, create the circumstances in which it will never happen again.\" Gary McMichael, leader of the Ulster Democratic Party which represents the UDA and UFF, said the peace deal meant many families would sleep easier in their own beds this Christmas. \"Those in loyalist communities who could have had a very anxious Christmas will now be able to look forward and celebrate in peace and comfort,\" he said. \"All of us are glad the terrible suffering is now at an end.\" However, an Ulster Unionist councillor, Chris McGimpsey, said it would take months for displaced families to get back to normal. \"I welcome this and I hope any further disputes can be resolved through mediation rather than violence ... but even when families are rehoused there are all sorts of bureaucratic issues and problems,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Stephen Downing, who supporters claim is the victim of Britain's longest-running miscarriage of justice, learned yesterday he would spend his 28th Christmas in prison because of a legal bungle at the court of appeal. Supporters of Mr Downing, who was jailed in 1974 for the murder of Wendy Sewell, a typist, reacted with fury when he was denied bail after a barrister for the crown prosecution service confessed he had not had time to prepare his side of the case which had been referred back to the appeal court. Julian Bevan QC, who left Britain last night for a Christmas trip to Africa, said he had only been notified of yesterday's high court bail hearing at 4.30pm the day before. \"I received briefing papers 10 days ago. I was not aware that a bail application would be made and therefore I did not read the papers with any degree of urgency,\" he told the court. \"I am not in a position to give the merits or demerits of the crown position because this takes considerable analysis.\" However, Mr Bevan, referring to prison psychiatric reports which say that Downing is \"in denial\" of murder, urged that the court should be \"slow in granting bail\". The judge, Mr Justice Crane, said that without a view from the prosecution bail could only be granted when the prospects of success at appeal were clear. \"This is not one of those clear cases or straightforward cases in which it is right to grant bail.\" Downing, 44, had his case referred back to the appeal court by the criminal cases review commission on November 14. The bail hearing was told that an investigation by the CCRC had cast doubt on the reliability of the confession Downing made on the day of the murder, and on the forensic evidence. Don Hale, editor of the Matlock Mercury, who has campaigned for the former cemetery gardener's release for six years, said the prisoner and his parents would be devastated. \"I think we're all stunned by the decision. It is another ridiculous statement. \"The crown prosecution service has had 27 years to prepare for this case. The CCRC has had it for three and a half years. Stephen Downing is in jail for his 28th Christmas for a crime he didn't commit.\" Downing's father Ray, 66, a taxi driver who still lives in Bakewell where the murder was committed in 1973, said the family were resigned to the court's decision. Patrick McLoughlin, Downing's MP, described the circumstances surrounding the bail hearing as outrageous and demanded a statement from a minister in the Commons yesterday. A spokesman for the CPS blamed the defence for not serving notice of the bail hearing until Wednesday. Downing, who was 17 at the time, but had the reading age of an 11-year-old, was taken into custody by Derbyshire constabulary after he found Ms Sewell badly battered but still alive in the graveyard where he worked. His counsel, Edward Fitzgerald QC, yesterday outlined at the bail hearing the main findings of the CCRC. Downing's confession and the forensic evidence, \"the two main planks\" of the original prosecution case, had been undermined. He had been denied a lawyer during his police interview despite repeated requests, the court heard. At the original trial, a forensic examination of his bloodstained jeans had helped convict him, but an expert who looked again at the evidence expressed \"serious concerns,\" Mr Fitzgerald said. Downing can renew his appeal for bail if the prosecution takes a favourable view after studying the case. It has been given until January 20 to do so.",

But even this figure is unlikely to be reached: fishermen have been unable to find their cod quota since 1995, and cod is likely to become a luxury fish. A few years ago the average catch was 300,000 tonnes. </p> <p>The ministers will meet again in January to develop a recovery plan for cod, which will involve closing large areas of the North sea during the spring spawning season and changing nets so that the smaller fish can escape rather than be caught and wasted, as at present. </p> <p>The permitted catches of haddock, hake, whiting, prawn and flatfish in the North sea channel and Irish sea were increased. This includes an extra 750 tonnes of haddock and 800 tonnes of hake. The planned 75% reduc tion in the permitted catch of hake was whittled down to 41%. </p> <p>Neither the conservation groups nor the fishermen are satisfied with the deal. </p> <p>Euan Dunn, fisheries policy officer of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: \"The scientists tell us that fish stocks are at historically low levels, with two-thirds seriously depleted, some to the point of collapse. </p> <p>\"Yet the horse-trading in Brussels means that ministers are still compromising on scientific advice.\" </p> <p>The Scottish Fishermen's Federation secretary, Ian Duncan, said: \"The quotas from Brussels make bleak reading. Each of the key stocks upon which Scottish fishermen depend has been cut. There can be no doubt about what such figures mean. </p> <p>\"Fishermen will lose their jobs and the income of the average fisherman will fall, recruitment into the industry will become increasingly difficult and, without support, the fishing industry of Scotland as we know it will cease to exist.\" </p> <p>He said the cuts would cost the Scottish industry a net loss of about \u00a360m: up to 110 vessels would be forced out of the fleet and at least 300 jobs lost. </p> <p>\"This figure may seem small, but it should be borne in mind that these jobs are in some of the remotest parts of the British Isles. There are few if any alternative sources of employment,\" he said. </p> <p>Barry Deas, of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said: \"It looks like a terrible outcome. We may have reduced the cuts in some areas, but we came from an appalling starting point.\" </p> <p>In Grimsby, fishermen and fish producers said the cuts would have a severe impact on the industry. </p> <p>Martin Boyers, chief executive of the Grimsby Fish Merchants' Association, said there would be job losses and higher prices for consumers. </p> <p>\"The effects probably won't be felt for several months, but when fishermen reach their quota limits in the middle of next year, jobs will go - and for every fisherman's job that goes, eight more shore jobs will follow.\" </p> <p>Nathan de Rozarieux, chief executive of the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation, who was in Brussels for the EU summit, said as he arrived back: \"I am bitterly disappointed with the outcome, and I told the minister so.\" </p> <p> <strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/fish/story/0,7369,411766,00.html\">John Vidal in Hull: Dead in the water</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/fish/story/0,7369,411763,00.html\">15 December: Overfishing brings more bad news to struggling ports</a> </p> <p><strong>Interactive</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,351825,00.html\">Guide to the fish stocks crisis</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,351828,00.html\">Play the interactive fishing game</a> </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/dgs/fisheries/index_en.htm\">European commission fisheries directorate</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nffo.org.uk/\" target=\"_new&quot;>National Federation of Fishermen\" s organisations< a><br></a><a href=\"http://www.unep.org\">UN Environment Programme</a><br><a href=\"http://www.wwf-uk.org/orca/\">WWF oceans recovery campaign</a><br><a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmagric/141/14102.htm\">Agriculture Committee fisheries report</a></p>",

The ministers will meet again in January to develop a recovery plan for cod, which will involve closing large areas of the North sea during the spring spawning season and changing nets so that the smaller fish can escape rather than be caught and wasted, as at present. The permitted catches of haddock, hake, whiting, prawn and flatfish in the North sea channel and Irish sea were increased. This includes an extra 750 tonnes of haddock and 800 tonnes of hake. The planned 75% reduc tion in the permitted catch of hake was whittled down to 41%. Neither the conservation groups nor the fishermen are satisfied with the deal. Euan Dunn, fisheries policy officer of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: \"The scientists tell us that fish stocks are at historically low levels, with two-thirds seriously depleted, some to the point of collapse. \"Yet the horse-trading in Brussels means that ministers are still compromising on scientific advice.\" The Scottish Fishermen's Federation secretary, Ian Duncan, said: \"The quotas from Brussels make bleak reading. Each of the key stocks upon which Scottish fishermen depend has been cut. There can be no doubt about what such figures mean. \"Fishermen will lose their jobs and the income of the average fisherman will fall, recruitment into the industry will become increasingly difficult and, without support, the fishing industry of Scotland as we know it will cease to exist.\" He said the cuts would cost the Scottish industry a net loss of about \u00a360m: up to 110 vessels would be forced out of the fleet and at least 300 jobs lost. \"This figure may seem small, but it should be borne in mind that these jobs are in some of the remotest parts of the British Isles. There are few if any alternative sources of employment,\" he said. Barry Deas, of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said: \"It looks like a terrible outcome. We may have reduced the cuts in some areas, but we came from an appalling starting point.\" In Grimsby, fishermen and fish producers said the cuts would have a severe impact on the industry. Martin Boyers, chief executive of the Grimsby Fish Merchants' Association, said there would be job losses and higher prices for consumers. \"The effects probably won't be felt for several months, but when fishermen reach their quota limits in the middle of next year, jobs will go - and for every fisherman's job that goes, eight more shore jobs will follow.\" Nathan de Rozarieux, chief executive of the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation, who was in Brussels for the EU summit, said as he arrived back: \"I am bitterly disappointed with the outcome, and I told the minister so.\" Related stories John Vidal in Hull: Dead in the water 15 December: Overfishing brings more bad news to struggling ports Interactive Guide to the fish stocks crisis Play the interactive fishing game Useful links European commission fisheries directorate UN Environment Programme WWF oceans recovery campaign Agriculture Committee fisheries report",

      "bodyText": "The government is preparing to back down in its confrontation with Ken Livingstone over public-private partnership plans for London Underground in what is likely to be seen as a significant retreat from its flagship part-privatisation programme for the public services. Tony Blair has instructed his deputy, John Prescott, to find a compromise with the mayor of London after months of increasingly damaging political wrangling over an issue that risked spinning out of control amid the continuing chaos in the privatised rail network. The about-turn follows weeks of talks between Downing Street and Mr Prescott's department and intense pressure from Bob Kiley, Mr Livingstone's new transport commissioner for London and the man credited with turning round the New York subway. Mr Kiley, who this week described the government's partial selloff plans for the tube as \"fatally flawed\", met Mr Prescott yesterday for the second time this week and it is understood that Mr Livingstone has also been in contact with the prime minister about the standoff. In the first concrete sign of movement from the government side, Mr Prescott - who has been unhappy with the initial private sector bids to run the tube's track and signalling - has agreed to delay signing any of the planned 30-year contracts from next month until the end of March. The credibility of the government's part-privatisation scheme was dealt a further blow yesterday by a report from the national audit office, which cast doubt on whether it would be cheaper, safer or more flexible than a publicly funded alternative. Earlier this week, Mr Kiley published his own plan to rebuild the underground, using revenue-backed bonds to underpin a \u00a310bn investment programme. Mr Kiley branded the government scheme unsafe, replicating the fragmentation of the privatised railway network and failing to transfer risk to the private sector. Both Mr Livingstone and Mr Kiley have also made clear that they are prepared to shift ground, including keeping the PPP name, and taking on board elements of the government scheme. Amid widespread scorn for their existing plans, ministers have had to weigh the risks of legal action by the mayor, a world-class transport manager resigning in protest or, worst of all, a serious underground accident, if they press ahead with handing over half the tube to the private sector. The pressure on Mr Prescott intensified when the leaders of the rail unions issued a warning on Thursday that they would ballot tube workers for a strike unless they were given guarantees on safety under the planned PPP regime Jeremy Colman, assistant auditor general for the NAO, parliament's financial watchdog, said yesterday that the case for the public-private partnership scheme was \"clearly not proved\", adding: \"We are giving the government a flashing amber light.\" The NAO report said a government decision based solely on taking the best private sector bid, compared with the government's still secret estimate of comparative cost if the tube remains in public hands, would be \"unsound\". Mr Colman said: \"We are not saying think again. We are saying think.\" Mr Livingstone welcomed the NAO's findings. \"The government clearly wanted the national audit office to endorse the PPP.

Mr Bush will also face rightwing opposition from his party's political base to attempts to appoint Democrats or even moderate Republicans, such as Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania or Governor Christie Whitman of New Jersey, to sensitive positions. The Rev Jerry Falwell, the Christian fundamentalist leader, fired a warning shot as speculation about cabinet posts grew. He said: \"The worst thing Mr Bush could do is bring Democrats into his administration or reach out to Governor Whitman or Governor Ridge for key positions, when these people do not believe what his constituency believes or what he believes.\" Key rulings US supreme court rulings Florida supreme court rulings Related stories Florida moves to hand Bush victory Jonathan Freedland: a nation divided Timeline - how we got here Election glossary Graphic: Know your chad Photo gallery After the vote, before the ruling Interactive Results declared, state by state Audio 'People are beginning to ask questions' 3 December 2000: Julian Borger in Tallahassee on the black voters denied their rights.

So, with prices in a spin on both sides of the Atlantic, the question has to be asked: will Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan be prepared to don Santa's robes? </p> <p>Let's be clear. Microsoft is no ordinary company. To the extent that there is a bellwether of the new economy it is the company that Bill Gates co-founded. Equally worryingly, the company is a bellwether of the old economy, too. Plenty of the traditional blue chip companies use Microsoft products. If the Seattle outfit says it is going to miss performance targets - even by relatively modest amounts - it is a safe bet that America's economy is beginning to hurt. </p> <p>As such, yesterday's official data showing a fall in manufacturing output were slightly beside the point.

      "bodyText": "This week Microsoft cast itself in the role of Scrooge, spoiling any chance of the markets celebrating the festive season. So, with prices in a spin on both sides of the Atlantic, the question has to be asked: will Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan be prepared to don Santa's robes? Let's be clear. Microsoft is no ordinary company. To the extent that there is a bellwether of the new economy it is the company that Bill Gates co-founded. Equally worryingly, the company is a bellwether of the old economy, too. Plenty of the traditional blue chip companies use Microsoft products. If the Seattle outfit says it is going to miss performance targets - even by relatively modest amounts - it is a safe bet that America's economy is beginning to hurt. As such, yesterday's official data showing a fall in manufacturing output were slightly beside the point. The markets were already in sell mode after Microsoft's bombshell that was delivered after trading had finished on Thursday night, warning that second-quarter earnings would miss expectations by around 5%.

He plans to sue his former partner for \"deceit\", the emotional distress caused by the discovery and costs plus interest he incurred while bringing up the boy for eight years during which he regarded him as his son. The 53-year-old businessman, from the West Midlands, and his former partner cannot be identified due to a court order protecting the identity of the child. He became suspicious that the child was not his when in 1994 the results of a sperm test showed that he was infertile. He had been surprised when his lover became pregnant in 1988 as in 1975 he underwent a vasectomy. In 1996 a DNA test established that the child was not his. Mr X and the boy's mother, Mrs Y, have remarried. Mrs Y and the child live in the north-east. At a preliminary hearing at Birmingham crown court Mr X's solicitor, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, said the action would attempt to prove a tort - a civil wrong - had been done to the claimant. The solicitor said the couple had never married, adding: \"Mr X did have a very positive relationship with the child when he thought the child was his. We think this is a valid course of action.\" The solicitor added that the woman being sued maintained that she honestly believed that Mr X was the father of her son. Harvey McGregor QC, representing Mr X, yesterday outlined the claimant's case at a preliminary hearing in the queen's bench division of the high court. Mr McGregor told the court: \"The claimant contends that he was deceived by the defendant into believing that the child to whom she gave birth was his.\" Mr McGregor said that a further round of tests in January this year had proved Mr X was not the child's father and the child's birth certificate has now been \"corrected\". Alistair Smail, representing Mrs Y, asked Mr Justice Stanley Burnton whether it was right in law that a woman could be sued for fraud for representing to a man that he was the father of her child when he was not. Mr X's suspicions over the parentage of his \"son\" were aroused in 1994 when Mrs Y left him, taking the child to the north-east to set up home with her current husband. Shortly after she left she demanded a cash payment of \u00a3280,000, which she regarded as her share of his property, maintenance of \u00a3600 a month and a Porsche to replace the one she had been using while living with Mr X. In response Mr X set about proving that the child was not his. The initial solicitors he retained he considered unsatisfactory, and he is running a parallel legal action against them. According to his solicitor recovery of the money spent on raising the child is secondary to recompense for the distress the episode has caused. Since 1996 Mrs Y has prevented him seeing the child. Asked if Mr X has any desire to see the child his solicitor said: \"I'm not sure he's bothered either way. He will treat him on a friendly basis if he does meet him again, but the truth is he is not his son. \"He is also reluctant to visit the child, who is well settled in a new environment, for fear of disrupting his upbringing.\" Judgment was reserved on whether the lawsuit can go ahead. It is expected to be delivered in writing in London next year.",

      "body": "<p>This Christmas, while snoozing on the sofa after lunch, spare a thought for those embarking on MBA courses early in the new year. They will decline that last glass of port to spend time on their reading list.</p> <p>The MBA has been a victim of its own success. The classic MBA, which stems from 50s America, became the elite master's qualification - only to suffer humiliating doubts about its validity because too many graduates pursued an MBA and the sheer numbers began to dilute its exclusivity.</p> <p>Showing admirable resilience, the MBA has bounced back. In today's dot.com world of innovation, the qualification is ironically becoming even more relevant as managers increasingly recognise they need a broader base of skills if they are to add real value to their businesses. An MBA may no longer be a shortcut to instant career success, but it is still the world's most popular business qualification - and suppliers have been quick to respond to the managerial demand.</p> <p>Today, around 800 business schools and other institutions in the US and Europe offer MBAs to an annual intake of more than 100,000. Although a wide variety of programmes fall under the MBA banner - including modular, consortium, specialist, company and distance-learning MBAs - the bulk of them are imitative, not innovative, in style. Most are housed within more traditional academic institutions and feature standard methods of delivering and assessing learning.</p> <p>This presents a challenge for today's potential students who have to shop around in the global MBA marketplace to find the programme that best suits their needs. Because programme styles are so similar, many students base their choice on a \"beauty parade\" of the top providers.</p> <p>Hence, all MBAs are equal, but some are more equal than others. There is an understandable temptation to opt for the relative safety of a recognised brand name and those providers who are unable to trade on reputation or who are offering \"me-too\" programmes will struggle to survive.</p> <p>Business schools have begun to respond to this threat. Many are actively striving to differentiate their programmes and this seems to be an on-going trend. The overly structured curriculum format is looking tired. In its place, a new model for MBA is developing.</p> <p>As organisations undergo constant change, individuals also need to go through a process of self-renewal, in terms of refining their existing skills, learning new skills and managing their careers. To be truly effective, an MBA programme has to assist the individual in this endeavour.</p> <p>Many MBAs focus on strategic thinking, technical expertise and the traditional skills of marketing and finance. New model MBAs cover these aspects, but also focus on \"softer\" skills, such as interpersonal sensitivity, which help to develop more rounded and effective managers.</p> <p>The concept of self-renewal hinges on the fact that it doesn't matter how much experience you've got, there's always more to learn - and the learning doesn't stop after the course ends. That openness to learning is vital for potential participants of the new MBAs. With traditional MBAs, participants don't get the opportunity to have an input on the design of the course. The new model shifts the emphasis from the assumed interests of the group to the specific needs of the individual.</p> <p>Being locked into a structured curriculum may suit some, but, for others, it may not necessarily deliver what they need. In a world of rapid change, managers need to be flexible, yet the traditional-style MBA reinforces old patterns of behaviour. New model programmes mirror what's happening in the changing corporate environment. They offer more scope to build on existing expertise and concentrate on managers' business priorities.</p> <p>Providers can actually allow participants to design their own MBA - by helping them determine what and how they will learn, in the context of their own needs. All of this raises an issue for providers. They need to be rigorous in their selection to ensure that applicants are comfortable with the self-managed concept and, equally, they need to be able to support that approach.</p> <p>This demands a change in the delivery of MBAs. On traditional MBA programmes, the primary means of disseminating knowledge is through a faculty of academic staff and a network of visiting contributors.

      "bodyText": "This Christmas, while snoozing on the sofa after lunch, spare a thought for those embarking on MBA courses early in the new year. They will decline that last glass of port to spend time on their reading list. The MBA has been a victim of its own success. The classic MBA, which stems from 50s America, became the elite master's qualification - only to suffer humiliating doubts about its validity because too many graduates pursued an MBA and the sheer numbers began to dilute its exclusivity. Showing admirable resilience, the MBA has bounced back. In today's dot.com world of innovation, the qualification is ironically becoming even more relevant as managers increasingly recognise they need a broader base of skills if they are to add real value to their businesses. An MBA may no longer be a shortcut to instant career success, but it is still the world's most popular business qualification - and suppliers have been quick to respond to the managerial demand. Today, around 800 business schools and other institutions in the US and Europe offer MBAs to an annual intake of more than 100,000. Although a wide variety of programmes fall under the MBA banner - including modular, consortium, specialist, company and distance-learning MBAs - the bulk of them are imitative, not innovative, in style. Most are housed within more traditional academic institutions and feature standard methods of delivering and assessing learning. This presents a challenge for today's potential students who have to shop around in the global MBA marketplace to find the programme that best suits their needs. Because programme styles are so similar, many students base their choice on a \"beauty parade\" of the top providers. Hence, all MBAs are equal, but some are more equal than others. There is an understandable temptation to opt for the relative safety of a recognised brand name and those providers who are unable to trade on reputation or who are offering \"me-too\" programmes will struggle to survive. Business schools have begun to respond to this threat. Many are actively striving to differentiate their programmes and this seems to be an on-going trend. The overly structured curriculum format is looking tired. In its place, a new model for MBA is developing. As organisations undergo constant change, individuals also need to go through a process of self-renewal, in terms of refining their existing skills, learning new skills and managing their careers. To be truly effective, an MBA programme has to assist the individual in this endeavour. Many MBAs focus on strategic thinking, technical expertise and the traditional skills of marketing and finance. New model MBAs cover these aspects, but also focus on \"softer\" skills, such as interpersonal sensitivity, which help to develop more rounded and effective managers. The concept of self-renewal hinges on the fact that it doesn't matter how much experience you've got, there's always more to learn - and the learning doesn't stop after the course ends. That openness to learning is vital for potential participants of the new MBAs. With traditional MBAs, participants don't get the opportunity to have an input on the design of the course. The new model shifts the emphasis from the assumed interests of the group to the specific needs of the individual. Being locked into a structured curriculum may suit some, but, for others, it may not necessarily deliver what they need. In a world of rapid change, managers need to be flexible, yet the traditional-style MBA reinforces old patterns of behaviour. New model programmes mirror what's happening in the changing corporate environment. They offer more scope to build on existing expertise and concentrate on managers' business priorities. Providers can actually allow participants to design their own MBA - by helping them determine what and how they will learn, in the context of their own needs. All of this raises an issue for providers. They need to be rigorous in their selection to ensure that applicants are comfortable with the self-managed concept and, equally, they need to be able to support that approach. This demands a change in the delivery of MBAs. On traditional MBA programmes, the primary means of disseminating knowledge is through a faculty of academic staff and a network of visiting contributors. Without the restrictions of a conventional faculty, new model programmes have greater freedom to draw from wider sources. As well as input from practitioners, they can also utilise seminars, books, company visits and other sources of learning. Another difference is the role of the academic staff themselves. New model programmes place far greater emphasis on skills such as facilitation to help participants manage their own learning. The very foundation of new model programmes should be that learning is delivered and assessed in a way that is closely linked to the business environment. \"Differentiate or die\" has long been a rallying cry on many traditional MBAs. Now, providers must learn that lesson. The fight is on for providers to offer students an MBA relevant to their organisation, to their day-to-day work and to their future development - one that incorporates sound theory which they can use in practice. \u0095 Gary Miles is programme director of Roffey Park Management Institute's Executive MBA .",

      "body": "<p>When Dr Geoffrey Longson got divorced in 1995 his house at Velstead Farm, near Fleet in Hampshire, along with seven and a half hectares and some stables, was sold for some \u00a32.75 million.</p> <p>The buyer intended to develop most of the transferred land. Dr Longson had never farmed the land, using it instead to keep his family's horses on, and considered that it was all really part of his home in the way most people regard their back garden.</p> <p>The property had gone up in value dramatically while the Longson family were living there. This was, perhaps, fortunate, as his children had developed a taste for expensive equestrian hobbies. His daughter took part in three-day eventing at a high level and his son had become an accomplished polo player.</p> <p>Dr Longson had hoped to avoid paying capital gains tax on the basis that the land, as well as his house, was his main residence, and therefore exempt from that tax. The local tax inspector disagreed. He claimed that Dr Longson did not require seven hectares for the reasonable enjoyment of his property.</p> <p>Only half a hectare automatically qualifies for exemption from tax.

      "bodyText": "When Dr Geoffrey Longson got divorced in 1995 his house at Velstead Farm, near Fleet in Hampshire, along with seven and a half hectares and some stables, was sold for some \u00a32.75 million. The buyer intended to develop most of the transferred land. Dr Longson had never farmed the land, using it instead to keep his family's horses on, and considered that it was all really part of his home in the way most people regard their back garden. The property had gone up in value dramatically while the Longson family were living there. This was, perhaps, fortunate, as his children had developed a taste for expensive equestrian hobbies. His daughter took part in three-day eventing at a high level and his son had become an accomplished polo player. Dr Longson had hoped to avoid paying capital gains tax on the basis that the land, as well as his house, was his main residence, and therefore exempt from that tax. The local tax inspector disagreed. He claimed that Dr Longson did not require seven hectares for the reasonable enjoyment of his property. Only half a hectare automatically qualifies for exemption from tax. The nature of this property meant that it would be reasonable to increase the exempt area to just over an acre. The fact that Dr Longson required the land for his horses was a sep arate consideration that did not entitle him to tax relief. He did not have to keep horses there to enjoy the property. Although Dr Longson appealed against the decision, the High Court, in a decision that will send shivers down the spines of many owners of large homes, last month ordered him to pay \u00a3560,000 capital gains tax. The Revenue's own guidelines suggest that the exemption will still be allowed in respect of anything that is what it describes as \"naturally and traditionally\" the garden of the house. The use of land for commercial purposes such as market gardening or commercial stabling would take it outside this definition. Previously, in grey areas such as this, both the Revenue and the courts have tended to be generous to taxpayers. In a 1990 decision, involving Lady Beryl Rook, the Court of Appeal upheld the long-standing principle, which may shortly be reconsidered, that a staff cottage in the grounds of a larger home was usually part of the main home. Interestingly, although Lady Rook was selling more than four hectares of land along with her house and cottage, the Revenue at that time did not then seek to argue that it was outside the exemption. The relatively hard line that has been taken in Dr Longson's case may be symptomatic of the Revenue's intention to take a closer look at transactions involving homes of the wealthy in future. \u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister",

Mr Hamilton is appealing against the verdict of a libel jury last year that found him to be corrupt. Mr Hamilton brought the action against Mr Fayed after he claimed, in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme screened in January 1997, that Mr Hamilton had demanded and accepted cash payments, gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Paris Ritz in return for asking parliamentary questions on behalf of Harrods. Judgment could be delivered as early as next week, but is more likely to be next month. During the five-day hearing at the royal courts of justice in London, Mr Hamilton accused Mr Fayed of paying \u00a310,000 for legal documents allegedly stolen from the rubbish bins of Mr Hamilton's lawyers. The documents, including cross-examination notes, were used to coach witnesses called by Mr Fayed, the court was told. The documents were said to have been stolen by Benjamin Pell, known as Benjy the Binman, who has in the past sold documents taken from rubbish bins to national newspapers. Yesterday Mr Hamilton's counsel, Anthony Boswood QC, told the judges: \"This was an act of gross misconduct and a serious abuse of process.\" He maintained that the fairness of the trial had been fundamentally undermined and it was likely the jury would have reached a different conclusion. He also said it was \"not possible\" that the trial judge would have ignored the allegations had they been made at the time and would certainly have changed his summing up. Mr Fayed's counsel, Michael Beloff QC, dismissed Mr Hamilton's case as \"so flimsy\" that it did not require factual rebuttal. He submitted that even if the appeal judges were to find that the trial judge and the jury were misled, the most Mr Hamilton would be entitled to was a retrial. Mr Beloff said the documents were in the dustbins because they lacked \"the sensitivity or confidentiality which made it necessary for them to be shredded\". \"This was a race that was truly won without the benefit of artificial aids and the verdict should stand in Mr Fayed's favour,\" he said. Mr Boswood said during the hearings that Mr Pell claimed that David Leigh, a Guardian journalist, had suggested he get documents from dustbins for Mr Fayed. No evidence was heard from Mr Pell, and the court was subsequently told by Mr Beloff that Mr Leigh had written to Mr Hamilton's lawyers denying the allegation.",

The twins' parents, strict Roman Catholics, from Gozo, off Malta, had opposed the operation, but the high court and court of appeal had ruled it was lawful, since without a separation, both twins would have died.</p> <p>After hearing two hours of evidence from a consultant paediatrician and a paediatric pathologist at Manchester coroner's court, Mr Gorodkin ruled simply: \"Mary died following surgery separating her from her conjoined twin, which surgery was permitted by an order of the high court, confirmed by the court of appeal.\"</p> <p>Mr Gorodkin said the case had been unique to the court of appeal. He said: \"It is as unique for me as a coroner as it was for the judges. I don't believe any coroner has had to consider a death from surgery when it was known beforehand the patient was going to die. All surgery carries with it a mortality rate but in the case of Mary that was a 100% rate.\"</p> <p>He said he might have considered a verdict of lawful killing, but \"the purpose and the reason for the separation was not to kill Mary even though her death arose from it\".</p> <p>He said a verdict of unlawful killing was not applicable, \"although some people emotionally believe that Mary was murdered, of course that is not the case\".</p> <p>Adrian Bianchi, a paediatric consultant who helped perform the separation, told the hearing that Mary had had no chance of survival without her twin. He said: \"The only reason she was able to survive was because she was linked to her sister, who acted as a life support machine.\"</p> <p>Mr Bianchi said reports from a child psychologist showed Jodie was now a \"bright, alert and interested child\" functioning at a level normal for a 4- to five-month-old baby, and was therefore advanced beyond her age.</p> <p>Anna Kelsey, a paediatric pathologist, told the inquest that Mary's heart had almost filled her chest and weighed 72g when the normal weight was 23g for a baby of that age. She said Mary's lungs were \"miniature\" versions of the norm, weighing only 7.2grams, compared to an average baby's 65grams. Mary had died from cardiac and respiratory complications.</p> <p>After the verdict, Mr Gorodkin said that when Mary died, he had let the twins' parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard, keep her with them for a day. \"That showed how much the parents felt for the deceased baby,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Gorodkin said the parents must have been \"horrified\" at the discussions on whether the babies should be seen as two separate people. \"For them, they clearly had two daughters whom they loved equally.\"</p> <p>John Kitchingman, the parents' solicitor, said the couple accepted the coroner's verdict.</p>",

He said it would be wrong to return an open verdict because he knew exactly the circumstances which had led to Mary's death. She had died within minutes of separation during a 20-hour operation at Manchester Royal Infirmary on November 6. The twins' parents, strict Roman Catholics, from Gozo, off Malta, had opposed the operation, but the high court and court of appeal had ruled it was lawful, since without a separation, both twins would have died. After hearing two hours of evidence from a consultant paediatrician and a paediatric pathologist at Manchester coroner's court, Mr Gorodkin ruled simply: \"Mary died following surgery separating her from her conjoined twin, which surgery was permitted by an order of the high court, confirmed by the court of appeal.\" Mr Gorodkin said the case had been unique to the court of appeal. He said: \"It is as unique for me as a coroner as it was for the judges. I don't believe any coroner has had to consider a death from surgery when it was known beforehand the patient was going to die. All surgery carries with it a mortality rate but in the case of Mary that was a 100% rate.\" He said he might have considered a verdict of lawful killing, but \"the purpose and the reason for the separation was not to kill Mary even though her death arose from it\". He said a verdict of unlawful killing was not applicable, \"although some people emotionally believe that Mary was murdered, of course that is not the case\". Adrian Bianchi, a paediatric consultant who helped perform the separation, told the hearing that Mary had had no chance of survival without her twin. He said: \"The only reason she was able to survive was because she was linked to her sister, who acted as a life support machine.\" Mr Bianchi said reports from a child psychologist showed Jodie was now a \"bright, alert and interested child\" functioning at a level normal for a 4- to five-month-old baby, and was therefore advanced beyond her age. Anna Kelsey, a paediatric pathologist, told the inquest that Mary's heart had almost filled her chest and weighed 72g when the normal weight was 23g for a baby of that age. She said Mary's lungs were \"miniature\" versions of the norm, weighing only 7.2grams, compared to an average baby's 65grams. Mary had died from cardiac and respiratory complications. After the verdict, Mr Gorodkin said that when Mary died, he had let the twins' parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard, keep her with them for a day. \"That showed how much the parents felt for the deceased baby,\" he said. Mr Gorodkin said the parents must have been \"horrified\" at the discussions on whether the babies should be seen as two separate people. \"For them, they clearly had two daughters whom they loved equally.\" John Kitchingman, the parents' solicitor, said the couple accepted the coroner's verdict.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This much we know. On Thursday, December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a 42-year-old black seamstress, boarded a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, after a hard day's work, took a seat and headed for home. The bus went three stops before several white passengers got on. The driver, James Blake, turned around and ordered the black passengers to go to the back of the bus, so that the whites could take their places. \"Move y'all, I want those two seats,\" he yelled.</p> <p>The bus froze. Blake persisted. \"Y'all better make it light on yourselves and let me have those seats,\" he said.</p> <p>The three black passengers sitting alongside Parks rose reluctantly. Parks stayed put. Blake approached her. \"Are you going to stand up?\" he asked.</p> <p>\"No,\" said Parks.</p> <p>\"Well, I'm going to have you arrested,\" he replied.</p> <p>\"You may do that,\" said Parks, who is now 87 and lives in Detroit.</p> <p>It was an exchange later credited with changing the racial landscape of America. Parks's arrest sparked a chain reaction that started the bus boycott that launched the civil rights movement that transformed the apartheid of America's southern states from a local idiosyncrasy to an international scandal. It was her individual courage that triggered the collective display of defiance that turned a previously unknown 26-year-old preacher, Martin Luther King, into a household name.</p> <p>It was a journey not only into history but also mythology. \"She was a victim of both the forces of history and the forces of destiny,\" said King, in a quote now displayed in the civil rights museum in Atlanta. \"She had been tracked down by the zeitgeist - the spirit of the times.\" And, from there, the short distance to sanctity: they called her \"Saint Rosa\", \"an angel walking\", \"a heaven-sent messenger\". \"She gave me the feeling that I was the Moses that God had sent to Pharaoh,\" said Fred Gray, the lawyer who went on to represent her.</p> <p>But somewhere en route they mislaid the truth. Rosa Parks was neither a victim nor a saint, but a long-standing political activist and feminist. Moreover, she was not the first person to take a stand by keeping her seat and challenging the system. Nine months before Parks's arrest, a 15-year-old girl, Claudette Colvin, was thrown off a bus in the same town and in almost identical circumstances.</p> <p>Like Parks, she, too, pleaded not guilty to breaking the law. And, like Parks, the local black establishment started to rally support nationwide for her cause. But, unlike Parks, Colvin never made it into the civil rights hall of fame. Just as her case was beginning to catch the nation's imagination, she became pregnant. To the exclusively male and predominantly middle-class, church-dominated, local black leadership in Montgomery, she was a fallen woman. She fell out of history altogether.</p> <p>King Hill, Montgomery, is the sepia South. In this small, elevated patch of town, black people sit out on wooden porches and watch an impoverished world go by. Broken-down cars sit outside tumble-down houses. The pace of life is so slow and the mood so mellow that local residents look as if they have been wading through molasses in a half-hearted attempt to catch up with the past 50 years.</p> <p>\"Middle-class blacks looked down on King Hill,\" says Colvin today. \"We had unpaved streets and outside toilets. We used to have a lot of juke joints up there, and maybe men would drink too much and get into a fight. It wasn't a bad area, but it had a reputation.\" It is here, at 658 Dixie Drive, that Colvin, 61, was raised by a great aunt, who was a maid, and great uncle, who was a \"yard boy\", whom she grew up calling her parents.</p> <p>Today, she sits in a diner in the Bronx, her pudding-basin haircut framing a soft face with a distant smile. Her voice is soft and high, almost shrill. The urban bustle surrounding her could not seem further away from King Hill. She now works as a nurses' aide at an old people's home in downtown Manhattan. She turns, watches, wipes, feeds and washes the elderly patients and offers them a gentle, consoling word when they become disoriented.</p> <p>\"I make up stories to convince them to stay in bed.\" Her rhythm is simple and lifestyle frugal. She works the night shift and sleeps \"when the sleep falls on her\" during the day. She shops with her workmates and watches action movies on video. Until recently, none of her workmates knew anything of her pioneering role in the civil rights movement.</p> <p>But go to King Hill and mention her name, and the first thing they will tell you is that she was the first. They remember her as a confident, studious, young girl with a streak that was rebellious without being boisterous. \"She was a bookworm,\" says Gloria Hardin, who went to school with Colvin and who still lives in King Hill. \"Always studying and using long words.\"</p> <p>\"She was an A student, quiet, well-mannered, neat, clean, intelligent, pretty, and deeply religious,\" writes Jo Ann Robinson in her authoritative book, The Montgomery Bus Boycott And The Women Who Started It.</p> <p>Colvin was also very dark-skinned, which put her at the bottom of the social pile within the black community - in the pigmentocracy of the South at the time, and even today, while whites discriminated against blacks on grounds of skin colour, the black community discriminated against each other in terms of skin shade. The lighter you were, it was generally thought, the better; the closer your skin tone was to caramel, the closer you were perceived to be to whatever power structure prevailed, and the more likely you were to attract suspicion from those of a darker hue.</p> <p>From \"high-yellas\" to \"coal-coloureds\", it is a tension steeped not only in language but in the arts, from Harlem Renaissance novelist Nella Larsen's book, Passing, to Spike Lee's film, School Daze. \"The light-skinned girls always thought they were better looking,\" says Colvin. \"So did the teachers, too. That meant most of the dark complexion ones didn't like themselves.\"</p> <p>Not so Colvin. They had threatened to throw her out of the Booker T Washington school for wearing her hair in plaits. As well as the predictable teenage fantasy of \"marrying a baseball player\", she also had strong political convictions. When Ms Nesbitt, her 10th grade teacher, asked the class to write down what they wanted to be, she unfolded a piece of paper with Colvin's handwriting on it that said: \"President of the United States.\"</p> <p>\"I wanted to go north and liberate my people,\" explains Colvin. \"They did think I was nutty and crazy.\"</p> <p>One incident in particular preoccupied her at the time - the plight of her schoolmate, Jeremiah Reeves. Reeves was a teenage grocery delivery boy who was found having sex with a white woman. The woman alleged rape; Reeves insisted it was consensual. Either way, he had violated the South's deeply ingrained taboo on interracial sex - Alabama only voted to legalise interracial marriage last month (the state held a referendum at the same time as the ballot for the US presidency), and then only by a 60-40 majority. \"When I was in the ninth grade, all the police cars came to get Jeremiah,\" says Colvin. \"They put him on death row.\" Four years later, they executed him.</p> <p>It was this dark, clever, angry young woman who boarded the Highland Avenue bus on Friday, March 2, 1955, opposite Martin Luther King's church on Dexter Avenue, Montgomery. Colvin took her seat near the emergency door next to one black girl; two others sat across the aisle from her. The law at the time designated seats for black passengers at the back and for whites at the front, but left the middle as a murky no man's land. Black people were allowed to occupy those seats so long as white people didn't need them. If one white person wanted to sit down there, then all the black people on that row were supposed to get up and either stand or move further to the back.</p> <p>As more white passengers got on, the driver asked black people to give up their seats. The three other girls got up; Colvin stayed put. \"If it had been for an old lady, I would have got up, but it wasn't. I was sitting on the last seat that they said you could sit in. I didn't get up, because I didn't feel like I was breaking the law.\"</p> <p>To complicate matters, a pregnant black woman, Mrs Hamilton, got on and sat next to Colvin. The driver caught a glimpse of them through his mirror. \"He asked us both to get up. [Mrs Hamilton] said she was not going to get up and that she had paid her fare and that she didn't feel like standing,\" recalls Colvin. \"So I told him I was not going to get up, either. So he said, 'If you are not going to get up, I will get a policeman.'\"</p> <p>The atmosphere on the bus became very tense. \"We just sat there and waited for it all to happen,\" says Gloria Hardin, who was on the bus, too. \"We didn't know what was going to happen, but we knew something would happen.\"</p> <p>Almost 50 years on, Colvin still talks about the incident with a mixture of shock and indignation - as though she still cannot believe that this could have happened to her. She says she expected some abuse from the driver, but nothing more. \"I thought he would stop and shout and then drive on. That's what they usually did.\"</p> <p>But while the driver went to get a policeman, it was the white students who started to make noise. \"You got to get up,\" they shouted. \"She ain't got to do nothing but stay black and die,\" retorted a black passenger.</p> <p>The policeman arrived, displaying two of the characteristics for which white Southern men had become renowned: gentility and racism. He could not bring himself to chide Mrs Hamilton in her condition, but he could not allow her to stay where she was and flout the law as he understood it, either. So he turned on the black men sitting behind her. \"If any of you are not gentlemen enough to give a lady a seat, you should be put in jail yourself,\" he said.</p> <p>A sanitation worker, Mr Harris, got up, gave her his seat and got off the bus. That left Colvin. \"Aren't you going to get up?\" asked the policeman.</p> <p>\"No,\" said Colvin.</p> <p>He asked again.</p> <p>\"No, sir,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Oh God,\" wailed one black woman at the back. One white woman defended Colvin to the police; another said that, if she got away with this, \"they will take over\".</p> <p>\"I will take you off,\" said the policeman, then he kicked her. Two more kicks soon followed.</p> <p>For all her bravado, Colvin was shocked by the extremity of what happened next. \"It took on the form of harassment. I was very hurt, because I didn't know that white people would act like that and I ... I was crying,\" she says. The policeman grabbed her and took her to a patrolman's car in which his colleagues were waiting. \"What's going on with these niggers?\" asked one. Another cracked a joke about her bra size.</p> <p>\"I was really afraid, because you just didn't know what white people might do at that time,\" says Colvin. In August that year, a 14-year-old boy called Emmet Till had said, \"Bye, baby\", to a woman at a store in nearby Mississippi, and was fished out of the nearby Tallahatchie river a few days later, dead with a bullet in his skull, his eye gouged out and one side of his forehead crushed. \"I didn't know if they were crazy, if they were going to take me to a Klan meeting. I started protecting my crotch. I was afraid they might rape me.\"</p> <p>They took her to City Hall, where she was charged with misconduct, resisting arrest and violating the city segregation laws. The full enormity of what she had done was only just beginning to dawn on her. \"I went bipolar. I knew what was happening, but I just kept trying to shut it out.\"</p> <p>She concentrated her mind on things she had been learning at school. \"I recited Edgar Allan Poe, Annabel Lee, the characters in Midsummer Night's Dream, the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm.\" Anything to detach herself from the horror of reality. Her pastor was called and came to pick her up. By the time she got home, her parents already knew. Everybody knew.</p> <p>\"The news travelled fast,\" wrote Robinson. \"In a few hours, every Negro youngster on the streets discussed Colvin's arrest. Telephones rang. Clubs called special meetings and discussed the event with some degree of alarm. Mothers expressed concern about permitting their children on the buses. Men instructed their wives to walk or to share rides in neighbour's autos.\"</p> <p>It was going to be a long night on Dixie Drive. \"Nobody slept at home because we thought there would be some retaliation,\" says Colvin. An ad hoc committee headed by the most prominent local black activist, ED Nixon, was set up to discuss the possibility of making Colvin's arrest a test case. They sent a delegation to see the commissioner, and after a few meetings they appeared to have reached an understanding that the harassment would stop and that Colvin would be allowed to clear her name.</p> <p>When the trial was held, Colvin pleaded innocent but was found guilty and released on indefinite probation in her parents' care. \"She had remained calm all during the days of her waiting period and during the trial,\" wrote Robinson. \"But when she was found guilty, her agonised sobs penetrated the atmosphere of the courthouse.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, the shock waves of her defiance had reverberated throughout Montgomery and beyond. Letters of support came from as far afield as Oregon and California. She still has one - a handwritten note from William Harris in Sacramento. It reads: \"The wonderful thing which you have just done makes me feel like a craven coward. How encouraging it would be if more adults had your courage, self-respect and integrity. Respectfully and faithfully yours.\"</p> <p>But even as she inspired awe throughout the country, elders within Montgomery's black community began to doubt her suitability as a standard-bearer of the movement. \"I told Mrs Parks, as I had told other leaders in Montgomery, that I thought the Claudette Colvin arrest was a good test case to end segregation on the buses,\" says Fred Gray, Parks's lawyer. \"However, the black leadership in Montgomery at the time thought that we should wait.\"</p> <p>Some in Montgomery, particularly in King Hill, think the decision was informed by snobbery. \"It was partly because of her colour and because she was from the working poor,\" says Gwen Patton, who has been involved in civil rights work in Montgomery since the early 60s. \"She lived in a little shack. It was a case of 'bourgey' blacks looking down on the working-class blacks.\"</p> <p>\"They never thought much of us, so there was no way they were going to run with us,\" says Hardin. Others say it is because she was a foul-mouthed tearaway. \"It bothered some that there was an unruly, tomboy quality to Colvin, including a propensity for curse words and immature outbursts,\" writes Douglas Brinkly, who recently completed a biography of Parks. But people in King Hill do not remember Colvin as that type of girl, and the accusation irritates Colvin to this day. \"I never swore when I was young,\" she says. \"Never.\"</p> <p>Everyone, including Colvin, agreed that it was news of her pregnancy that ultimately persuaded the local black hierarchy to abandon her as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. For Colvin, the entire episode was traumatic: \"Nowadays, you'd call it statutory rape, but back then it was just the kind of thing that happened,\" she says, describing the conditions under which she conceived. She refused to name the father or have anything to do with him. \"When I told my mother I was pregnant, I thought she was going to have a heart attack. If I had told my father who did it, he would have killed him.\"</p> <p>A personal tragedy for her was seen as a political liability by the town's civil rights leaders. In his Pulitzer prize-winning account of the civil rights years, Parting The Waters, Taylor Branch wrote: \"Even if Montgomery Negroes were willing to rally behind an unwed, pregnant teenager - which they were not - her circumstances would make her an extremely vulnerable standard bearer.\"</p> <p>\"If the white press got ahold of that information, they would have [had] a field day,\" said Rosa Parks. \"They'd call her a bad girl, and her case wouldn't have a chance.\"</p> <p>Montgomery's black establishment leaders decided they would have to wait for the right person. And that person, it transpired, would be Rosa Parks. \"Mrs Parks was a married woman,\" said ED Nixon. \"She was morally clean, and she had a fairly good academic training ... If there was ever a person we would've been able to [use to] break the situation that existed on the Montgomery city line, Rosa L Parks was the woman to use ... I probably would've examined a dozen more before I got there if Rosa Parks hadn't come along before I found the right one.\"</p> <p>'Facts speak only when the historian calls on them,\" wrote the historian EH Carr in his landmark work, What Is History? \"It is he who decides which facts to give the floor and in what order or context. It is the historian who has decided for his own reasons that Caesar's crossing of that petty stream, the Rubicon, is a fact of history, whereas the crossing of the Rubicon by millions of other people before or since interests nobody at all.\"</p> <p>Montgomery was not home to the first bus boycott any more than Colvin was the first person to challenge segregation. Two years earlier, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, African-Americans launched an effective bus boycott after drivers refused to honour an integrated seating policy, which was settled in an unsatisfactory fudge.

      "bodyText": "This much we know. On Thursday, December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a 42-year-old black seamstress, boarded a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, after a hard day's work, took a seat and headed for home. The bus went three stops before several white passengers got on. The driver, James Blake, turned around and ordered the black passengers to go to the back of the bus, so that the whites could take their places. \"Move y'all, I want those two seats,\" he yelled. The bus froze. Blake persisted. \"Y'all better make it light on yourselves and let me have those seats,\" he said. The three black passengers sitting alongside Parks rose reluctantly. Parks stayed put. Blake approached her. \"Are you going to stand up?\" he asked. \"No,\" said Parks. \"Well, I'm going to have you arrested,\" he replied. \"You may do that,\" said Parks, who is now 87 and lives in Detroit. It was an exchange later credited with changing the racial landscape of America. Parks's arrest sparked a chain reaction that started the bus boycott that launched the civil rights movement that transformed the apartheid of America's southern states from a local idiosyncrasy to an international scandal. It was her individual courage that triggered the collective display of defiance that turned a previously unknown 26-year-old preacher, Martin Luther King, into a household name. It was a journey not only into history but also mythology. \"She was a victim of both the forces of history and the forces of destiny,\" said King, in a quote now displayed in the civil rights museum in Atlanta. \"She had been tracked down by the zeitgeist - the spirit of the times.\" And, from there, the short distance to sanctity: they called her \"Saint Rosa\", \"an angel walking\", \"a heaven-sent messenger\". \"She gave me the feeling that I was the Moses that God had sent to Pharaoh,\" said Fred Gray, the lawyer who went on to represent her. But somewhere en route they mislaid the truth. Rosa Parks was neither a victim nor a saint, but a long-standing political activist and feminist. Moreover, she was not the first person to take a stand by keeping her seat and challenging the system. Nine months before Parks's arrest, a 15-year-old girl, Claudette Colvin, was thrown off a bus in the same town and in almost identical circumstances. Like Parks, she, too, pleaded not guilty to breaking the law. And, like Parks, the local black establishment started to rally support nationwide for her cause. But, unlike Parks, Colvin never made it into the civil rights hall of fame. Just as her case was beginning to catch the nation's imagination, she became pregnant. To the exclusively male and predominantly middle-class, church-dominated, local black leadership in Montgomery, she was a fallen woman. She fell out of history altogether. King Hill, Montgomery, is the sepia South. In this small, elevated patch of town, black people sit out on wooden porches and watch an impoverished world go by. Broken-down cars sit outside tumble-down houses. The pace of life is so slow and the mood so mellow that local residents look as if they have been wading through molasses in a half-hearted attempt to catch up with the past 50 years. \"Middle-class blacks looked down on King Hill,\" says Colvin today. \"We had unpaved streets and outside toilets. We used to have a lot of juke joints up there, and maybe men would drink too much and get into a fight. It wasn't a bad area, but it had a reputation.\" It is here, at 658 Dixie Drive, that Colvin, 61, was raised by a great aunt, who was a maid, and great uncle, who was a \"yard boy\", whom she grew up calling her parents. Today, she sits in a diner in the Bronx, her pudding-basin haircut framing a soft face with a distant smile. Her voice is soft and high, almost shrill. The urban bustle surrounding her could not seem further away from King Hill. She now works as a nurses' aide at an old people's home in downtown Manhattan. She turns, watches, wipes, feeds and washes the elderly patients and offers them a gentle, consoling word when they become disoriented. \"I make up stories to convince them to stay in bed.\" Her rhythm is simple and lifestyle frugal. She works the night shift and sleeps \"when the sleep falls on her\" during the day. She shops with her workmates and watches action movies on video. Until recently, none of her workmates knew anything of her pioneering role in the civil rights movement. But go to King Hill and mention her name, and the first thing they will tell you is that she was the first. They remember her as a confident, studious, young girl with a streak that was rebellious without being boisterous. \"She was a bookworm,\" says Gloria Hardin, who went to school with Colvin and who still lives in King Hill. \"Always studying and using long words.\" \"She was an A student, quiet, well-mannered, neat, clean, intelligent, pretty, and deeply religious,\" writes Jo Ann Robinson in her authoritative book, The Montgomery Bus Boycott And The Women Who Started It. Colvin was also very dark-skinned, which put her at the bottom of the social pile within the black community - in the pigmentocracy of the South at the time, and even today, while whites discriminated against blacks on grounds of skin colour, the black community discriminated against each other in terms of skin shade. The lighter you were, it was generally thought, the better; the closer your skin tone was to caramel, the closer you were perceived to be to whatever power structure prevailed, and the more likely you were to attract suspicion from those of a darker hue. From \"high-yellas\" to \"coal-coloureds\", it is a tension steeped not only in language but in the arts, from Harlem Renaissance novelist Nella Larsen's book, Passing, to Spike Lee's film, School Daze. \"The light-skinned girls always thought they were better looking,\" says Colvin. \"So did the teachers, too. That meant most of the dark complexion ones didn't like themselves.\" Not so Colvin. They had threatened to throw her out of the Booker T Washington school for wearing her hair in plaits. As well as the predictable teenage fantasy of \"marrying a baseball player\", she also had strong political convictions. When Ms Nesbitt, her 10th grade teacher, asked the class to write down what they wanted to be, she unfolded a piece of paper with Colvin's handwriting on it that said: \"President of the United States.\" \"I wanted to go north and liberate my people,\" explains Colvin. \"They did think I was nutty and crazy.\" One incident in particular preoccupied her at the time - the plight of her schoolmate, Jeremiah Reeves. Reeves was a teenage grocery delivery boy who was found having sex with a white woman. The woman alleged rape; Reeves insisted it was consensual. Either way, he had violated the South's deeply ingrained taboo on interracial sex - Alabama only voted to legalise interracial marriage last month (the state held a referendum at the same time as the ballot for the US presidency), and then only by a 60-40 majority. \"When I was in the ninth grade, all the police cars came to get Jeremiah,\" says Colvin. \"They put him on death row.\" Four years later, they executed him. It was this dark, clever, angry young woman who boarded the Highland Avenue bus on Friday, March 2, 1955, opposite Martin Luther King's church on Dexter Avenue, Montgomery. Colvin took her seat near the emergency door next to one black girl; two others sat across the aisle from her. The law at the time designated seats for black passengers at the back and for whites at the front, but left the middle as a murky no man's land. Black people were allowed to occupy those seats so long as white people didn't need them. If one white person wanted to sit down there, then all the black people on that row were supposed to get up and either stand or move further to the back. As more white passengers got on, the driver asked black people to give up their seats. The three other girls got up; Colvin stayed put. \"If it had been for an old lady, I would have got up, but it wasn't. I was sitting on the last seat that they said you could sit in. I didn't get up, because I didn't feel like I was breaking the law.\" To complicate matters, a pregnant black woman, Mrs Hamilton, got on and sat next to Colvin. The driver caught a glimpse of them through his mirror. \"He asked us both to get up. [Mrs Hamilton] said she was not going to get up and that she had paid her fare and that she didn't feel like standing,\" recalls Colvin. \"So I told him I was not going to get up, either. So he said, 'If you are not going to get up, I will get a policeman.'\" The atmosphere on the bus became very tense. \"We just sat there and waited for it all to happen,\" says Gloria Hardin, who was on the bus, too. \"We didn't know what was going to happen, but we knew something would happen.\" Almost 50 years on, Colvin still talks about the incident with a mixture of shock and indignation - as though she still cannot believe that this could have happened to her. She says she expected some abuse from the driver, but nothing more. \"I thought he would stop and shout and then drive on. That's what they usually did.\" But while the driver went to get a policeman, it was the white students who started to make noise. \"You got to get up,\" they shouted. \"She ain't got to do nothing but stay black and die,\" retorted a black passenger. The policeman arrived, displaying two of the characteristics for which white Southern men had become renowned: gentility and racism. He could not bring himself to chide Mrs Hamilton in her condition, but he could not allow her to stay where she was and flout the law as he understood it, either. So he turned on the black men sitting behind her. \"If any of you are not gentlemen enough to give a lady a seat, you should be put in jail yourself,\" he said. A sanitation worker, Mr Harris, got up, gave her his seat and got off the bus. That left Colvin. \"Aren't you going to get up?\" asked the policeman. \"No,\" said Colvin. He asked again. \"No, sir,\" she said. \"Oh God,\" wailed one black woman at the back. One white woman defended Colvin to the police; another said that, if she got away with this, \"they will take over\". \"I will take you off,\" said the policeman, then he kicked her. Two more kicks soon followed. For all her bravado, Colvin was shocked by the extremity of what happened next. \"It took on the form of harassment. I was very hurt, because I didn't know that white people would act like that and I ... I was crying,\" she says. The policeman grabbed her and took her to a patrolman's car in which his colleagues were waiting. \"What's going on with these niggers?\" asked one. Another cracked a joke about her bra size. \"I was really afraid, because you just didn't know what white people might do at that time,\" says Colvin. In August that year, a 14-year-old boy called Emmet Till had said, \"Bye, baby\", to a woman at a store in nearby Mississippi, and was fished out of the nearby Tallahatchie river a few days later, dead with a bullet in his skull, his eye gouged out and one side of his forehead crushed. \"I didn't know if they were crazy, if they were going to take me to a Klan meeting. I started protecting my crotch. I was afraid they might rape me.\" They took her to City Hall, where she was charged with misconduct, resisting arrest and violating the city segregation laws. The full enormity of what she had done was only just beginning to dawn on her. \"I went bipolar. I knew what was happening, but I just kept trying to shut it out.\" She concentrated her mind on things she had been learning at school. \"I recited Edgar Allan Poe, Annabel Lee, the characters in Midsummer Night's Dream, the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm.\" Anything to detach herself from the horror of reality. Her pastor was called and came to pick her up. By the time she got home, her parents already knew. Everybody knew. \"The news travelled fast,\" wrote Robinson. \"In a few hours, every Negro youngster on the streets discussed Colvin's arrest. Telephones rang. Clubs called special meetings and discussed the event with some degree of alarm. Mothers expressed concern about permitting their children on the buses. Men instructed their wives to walk or to share rides in neighbour's autos.\" It was going to be a long night on Dixie Drive. \"Nobody slept at home because we thought there would be some retaliation,\" says Colvin. An ad hoc committee headed by the most prominent local black activist, ED Nixon, was set up to discuss the possibility of making Colvin's arrest a test case. They sent a delegation to see the commissioner, and after a few meetings they appeared to have reached an understanding that the harassment would stop and that Colvin would be allowed to clear her name. When the trial was held, Colvin pleaded innocent but was found guilty and released on indefinite probation in her parents' care. \"She had remained calm all during the days of her waiting period and during the trial,\" wrote Robinson. \"But when she was found guilty, her agonised sobs penetrated the atmosphere of the courthouse.\" Nonetheless, the shock waves of her defiance had reverberated throughout Montgomery and beyond. Letters of support came from as far afield as Oregon and California. She still has one - a handwritten note from William Harris in Sacramento. It reads: \"The wonderful thing which you have just done makes me feel like a craven coward. How encouraging it would be if more adults had your courage, self-respect and integrity. Respectfully and faithfully yours.\" But even as she inspired awe throughout the country, elders within Montgomery's black community began to doubt her suitability as a standard-bearer of the movement. \"I told Mrs Parks, as I had told other leaders in Montgomery, that I thought the Claudette Colvin arrest was a good test case to end segregation on the buses,\" says Fred Gray, Parks's lawyer. \"However, the black leadership in Montgomery at the time thought that we should wait.\" Some in Montgomery, particularly in King Hill, think the decision was informed by snobbery. \"It was partly because of her colour and because she was from the working poor,\" says Gwen Patton, who has been involved in civil rights work in Montgomery since the early 60s. \"She lived in a little shack. It was a case of 'bourgey' blacks looking down on the working-class blacks.\" \"They never thought much of us, so there was no way they were going to run with us,\" says Hardin. Others say it is because she was a foul-mouthed tearaway. \"It bothered some that there was an unruly, tomboy quality to Colvin, including a propensity for curse words and immature outbursts,\" writes Douglas Brinkly, who recently completed a biography of Parks. But people in King Hill do not remember Colvin as that type of girl, and the accusation irritates Colvin to this day. \"I never swore when I was young,\" she says. \"Never.\" Everyone, including Colvin, agreed that it was news of her pregnancy that ultimately persuaded the local black hierarchy to abandon her as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. For Colvin, the entire episode was traumatic: \"Nowadays, you'd call it statutory rape, but back then it was just the kind of thing that happened,\" she says, describing the conditions under which she conceived. She refused to name the father or have anything to do with him. \"When I told my mother I was pregnant, I thought she was going to have a heart attack. If I had told my father who did it, he would have killed him.\" A personal tragedy for her was seen as a political liability by the town's civil rights leaders. In his Pulitzer prize-winning account of the civil rights years, Parting The Waters, Taylor Branch wrote: \"Even if Montgomery Negroes were willing to rally behind an unwed, pregnant teenager - which they were not - her circumstances would make her an extremely vulnerable standard bearer.\" \"If the white press got ahold of that information, they would have [had] a field day,\" said Rosa Parks. \"They'd call her a bad girl, and her case wouldn't have a chance.\" Montgomery's black establishment leaders decided they would have to wait for the right person. And that person, it transpired, would be Rosa Parks. \"Mrs Parks was a married woman,\" said ED Nixon. \"She was morally clean, and she had a fairly good academic training ... If there was ever a person we would've been able to [use to] break the situation that existed on the Montgomery city line, Rosa L Parks was the woman to use ... I probably would've examined a dozen more before I got there if Rosa Parks hadn't come along before I found the right one.\" 'Facts speak only when the historian calls on them,\" wrote the historian EH Carr in his landmark work, What Is History? \"It is he who decides which facts to give the floor and in what order or context. It is the historian who has decided for his own reasons that Caesar's crossing of that petty stream, the Rubicon, is a fact of history, whereas the crossing of the Rubicon by millions of other people before or since interests nobody at all.\" Montgomery was not home to the first bus boycott any more than Colvin was the first person to challenge segregation. Two years earlier, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, African-Americans launched an effective bus boycott after drivers refused to honour an integrated seating policy, which was settled in an unsatisfactory fudge. And, like the pregnant Mrs Hamilton, many African-Americans refused to tolerate the indignity of the South's racist laws in silence. Nor was Colvin the last to be passed over. In the nine months between her arrest and that of Parks, another young black woman, Mary Louise Smith, suffered a similar fate. Smith was arrested in October 1955, but was also not considered an appropriate candidate for a broader campaign - ED Nixon claimed that her father was a drunkard; Smith insists he was teetotal. But there were two things about Colvin's stand on that March day that made it significant. First, it came less than a year after the US supreme court had outlawed the \"separate but equal\" policy that had provided the legal basis for racial segregation - what had been custom and practice in the South for generations was now against federal law and could be challenged in the courts. Second, she was the first person, in Montgomery at least, to take up the challenge. \"She was not the first person to be arrested for violation of the bus seating ordinance,\" said J Mills Thornton, an author and academic. \"But according to [the commissioner], she was the first person ever to enter a plea of not guilty to such a charge.\" It is a rare, and poor, civil rights book that covers the Montgomery bus boycott and does not mention Claudette Colvin. But it is also a rare and excellent one that gives her more than a passing, dismissive mention. However, not one has bothered to interview her. Most Americans, even in Montgomery, have never heard of her. She has literally become a footnote in history. For we like our history neat - an easy-to-follow, self-contained narrative with dates, characters and landmarks with which we can weave together otherwise unrelated events into one apparently seamless length of fabric held together by sequence and consequence. Complexity, with all its nuances and shaded realities, is a messy business. So we choose the facts to fit the narrative we want to hear. While this does not happen by conspiracy, it is often facilitated by collusion. In this respect, the civil rights movement in Montgomery moved fast. Rosa Parks was thrown off the bus on a Thursday; by Friday, activists were distributing leaflets that highlighted her arrest as one of many, including those of Colvin and Mary Louise Smith: \"Another Negro woman has been arrested and thrown in jail because she refused to get up out of her seat on the bus for a white person to sit down,\" they read. \"It is the second time since the Claudette Colvin case that a Negro woman has been arrested for the same thing.\" By Monday, the day the boycott began, Colvin had already been airbrushed from the official version of events.

Direct sowing of annuals where they are to flower may sound an easy option, but the seedlings will run up against serious competition from weed seeds that germinate at the same time and have greater vigour.

I made one with the wine. \"Idem\" said the wine list, and indicated that it was a blend of grapes used for Fiano di Avellino and Greco di Tufo. I have encountered these wines before, and found them austere, rather uncompromising fluids that cut across food with crisp authority - but what was this? A liquor that looked like a distillation of daffodils, soft and honeyed to the sniff, and smooth over the tongue, just this side of sweetness and with only a hint of the hoped for acidity to cut across a line-up that included warm octopus salad, tuna tartare, tagliatelle with duck sauce and pecorino, deep-fried fish Piedmontese-style with red cabbage and lemon sauce, and slow-cooked veal cheek in red wine with fennel and polenta. I apologised to Amaryllis, who was rather gracious about it.</p> <p>We were lunching at Ibla, one of those new-wave Italian restaurants that had been quietly garnering a good deal of unqualified approval from various distinguished quarters. In spite of the rather infra dig roadworks outside the front door, its house style sits happily with the street chic of Marylebone High Street - sort of distinctive but unshowy, smart but casual. There's the Shaker shop up the road, with the Orrery restaurant above the Conran shop further up, and other smartieboots places tlike that to go shopping in beforehand. The rich, ox-blood-red walls and ceiling and the natural (ie unbleached) wooden floor of Ibla's back dining room combined to produce a warm, designer, womb effect.</p> <p>Ibla is new-fashioned rather than trad Italian - it's neither trad London, with that oleaginous charm, giant pepper grinder and indifferent food, nor trad Roman or Bolognese, say, with their straightforward dishes prepared from great ingredients to time-honoured recipes. No, Ibla is in a new mould, which seems to have been specifically developed for the markets of London, New York and Michelin and which specialises in a sort of Frenchified Italian cooking, complete with French-style sauces and composed dishes that come complete with veg. If I am totally honest, I have to admit that I am not always in favour of this new style - every time I visit Italy, I am reminded of the excellence of simplicity, and that everything there is always based on the supreme quality of local ingredients - but I would hate to say that my mind is closed on the matter. I am a reasonable man. I am open to persuasion - and the food at Ibla is pretty persuasive at that.</p> <p>The French influence was represented in the main by Amaryllis's fish dishes. The tuna tartare is straight out of the French modern haute cuisine handbook, although at Ibla it is cut in larger chunks than is usual, which means you get more of the texture of the tuna. The fish was topped with a poached quail's egg, which added a certain unctuous, sticky lubrication to the tumulus of tuna, and matched with juvenile veg.</p> <p>The frittura mista di pesce e cavalo rosso in salsa di lemone was a pretty sophisticated take on fried goujons. As an item on the set- price lunch menu, it was generous to the point of extravagance, with large and small chunks of fish in a thistledown-light batter. The red cabbage was an interesting addition, cooked to within a millimetre of losing its crunch, with its natural, earthy sweetness making a rather interesting foil to the rest.</p> <p>The octopus in my warm salad with cherry tomatoes and crispy aubergine was irreproachable, positive without being chewy and fresh enough to hold its delicate and all too fugitive flavour. But what was lollo rosso doing in the salad? God, I hate the stuff - it's like eating a ballerina's tutu. And the aubergine crisps had more or less lost their crispness.</p> <p>The tagliatelle, on the other hand, was a perfectly splendid dish - deep-yellow pasta with small nuggets of muskily sweet duck given bounce by the salty punch of pecorino. My guanciale di vitello brasato con finocchio e polenta was even better. The meat gave out a kind of deep bass boom as it fell to bits between teeth and tongue. The juices of cheek and wine had been rendered to mellow harmony through long cooking, with the fennel bringing in a gently vegetable note. Only the hump of stodgy polenta seemed lumpenly at odds with this soul-comforting dish.</p> <p>And all the while Amaryllis drank the Idem without a word of complaint. Maybe she has a saintly good nature. Maybe she even liked the stuff. It was, in fact, a fine wine and, oddly enough, didn't go badly with both the tagliatelle and veal cheek. I suspect that it went rather less well with the fish, but there you go.</p> <p>And there we went, passing on pudding (perhaps not surprisingly), for \u00a381.50 - which, on a food to non-food ratio of \u00a344:\u00a337.50, seems to me to be pretty good value for money given the range and quality of what we ate. If you forget for a moment that it is Italian, and just concentrate on flavours, skill, pleasure, style and stuff like that, then Ibla is pretty near top-drawer material, make no mistake</p>",

The rich, ox-blood-red walls and ceiling and the natural (ie unbleached) wooden floor of Ibla's back dining room combined to produce a warm, designer, womb effect. Ibla is new-fashioned rather than trad Italian - it's neither trad London, with that oleaginous charm, giant pepper grinder and indifferent food, nor trad Roman or Bolognese, say, with their straightforward dishes prepared from great ingredients to time-honoured recipes. No, Ibla is in a new mould, which seems to have been specifically developed for the markets of London, New York and Michelin and which specialises in a sort of Frenchified Italian cooking, complete with French-style sauces and composed dishes that come complete with veg. If I am totally honest, I have to admit that I am not always in favour of this new style - every time I visit Italy, I am reminded of the excellence of simplicity, and that everything there is always based on the supreme quality of local ingredients - but I would hate to say that my mind is closed on the matter. I am a reasonable man. I am open to persuasion - and the food at Ibla is pretty persuasive at that. The French influence was represented in the main by Amaryllis's fish dishes. The tuna tartare is straight out of the French modern haute cuisine handbook, although at Ibla it is cut in larger chunks than is usual, which means you get more of the texture of the tuna. The fish was topped with a poached quail's egg, which added a certain unctuous, sticky lubrication to the tumulus of tuna, and matched with juvenile veg. The frittura mista di pesce e cavalo rosso in salsa di lemone was a pretty sophisticated take on fried goujons. As an item on the set- price lunch menu, it was generous to the point of extravagance, with large and small chunks of fish in a thistledown-light batter. The red cabbage was an interesting addition, cooked to within a millimetre of losing its crunch, with its natural, earthy sweetness making a rather interesting foil to the rest. The octopus in my warm salad with cherry tomatoes and crispy aubergine was irreproachable, positive without being chewy and fresh enough to hold its delicate and all too fugitive flavour. But what was lollo rosso doing in the salad? God, I hate the stuff - it's like eating a ballerina's tutu. And the aubergine crisps had more or less lost their crispness. The tagliatelle, on the other hand, was a perfectly splendid dish - deep-yellow pasta with small nuggets of muskily sweet duck given bounce by the salty punch of pecorino. My guanciale di vitello brasato con finocchio e polenta was even better. The meat gave out a kind of deep bass boom as it fell to bits between teeth and tongue. The juices of cheek and wine had been rendered to mellow harmony through long cooking, with the fennel bringing in a gently vegetable note. Only the hump of stodgy polenta seemed lumpenly at odds with this soul-comforting dish. And all the while Amaryllis drank the Idem without a word of complaint. Maybe she has a saintly good nature. Maybe she even liked the stuff. It was, in fact, a fine wine and, oddly enough, didn't go badly with both the tagliatelle and veal cheek. I suspect that it went rather less well with the fish, but there you go. And there we went, passing on pudding (perhaps not surprisingly), for \u00a381.50 - which, on a food to non-food ratio of \u00a344:\u00a337.50, seems to me to be pretty good value for money given the range and quality of what we ate. If you forget for a moment that it is Italian, and just concentrate on flavours, skill, pleasure, style and stuff like that, then Ibla is pretty near top-drawer material, make no mistake",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Why do we all rush through the weeks before Christmas, preparing like mad for the Big Day, and give so little thought to its Eve? While the great part of Europe, all the way from Scandinavia to Greece, celebrates Christmas Eve with rituals ranging from ancient and simple to elaborate and sumptuous, we Brits tend to ignore it altogether. We may, of course, be tired of the whole ghastly ritual by then, anyway; or perhaps it has something to do with old legends of witchcraft, of spirits being appeased and put to rest through revels, and of shaman-like rituals to banish evil beasties.</p> <p>The great festive jollities of Europe are many, but my gut feeling is that such traditions do not travel well, and are therefore best enjoyed on their own turf. There is, however, no reason whatsoever to miss out on all of the fun - and as a great deal of that fun revolves around food, then setting forth a fine supper of fish on Christmas Eve seems eminently sensible rather than radical or revolutionary.</p> <p>Indeed, traditionally, the meal before mass on Christmas Day has meat proscribed, which has given the devout on Christmas Eve a leaning towards a light meal - and that usually, although not necessarily, has consisted of fish.</p> <p>It's a fine notion, to my mind, and it seems such a pity that we British have never developed a festive fish dish of our own - come to that, we have no national fish dish of any kind, with the notable exception of the deep-fried affair with chips. Even that former magnifico of the Christmas sideboard, smoked salmon, which was for so long a Yuletide staple because it is expensive and easy to serve, has become largely debased in recent years, and is now more the preserve of the hopelessly naff.</p> <p>But I must stop: a harangue is really not what is required here. The point is to spread the great affair that is Christmas over a few days, not cram it all into a single, gut-busting meal. All that effort for just one day seems plain silly when diet and dignity are far better served by spreading it out over a longer period. It also expands the time available for pleasure - and there is no need to mention the digestive benefits of eating thus.</p> <p>So, I can think of no better way to set such a remarkable change in our national habits in train than by serving up a great dish of fish cooked in a pie or a chowder or a stew on Christmas Eve.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Fish Stew </b><br> Use as many or as few varieties of fish and shellfish as you want. Flatfish such as halibut, plaice and brill are particularly good cooked this way. I advocate making a simple stock in which the fish is later cooked on the bone. <br></p> <p>For the stock</p> <p><b> 4 medium leeks </b></p> <p><b>5 medium onions </b></p> <p><b>3 small carrots </b></p> <p><b>4 sticks celery </b></p> <p><b>1 bulb fennel (if available) </b></p> <p><b>1 whole bulb garlic </b></p> <p><b>1 bayleaf </b></p> <p><b>1 small sprig thyme </b></p> <p><b>12 black peppercorns </b></p> <p><b>bottle good white wine </b></p> <p><b>Generous pinch saffron</b></p> <p>For the stew</p> <p><b> 1.2kg white fish, on the bone </b></p> <p><b>300g mussels, scraped and bearded </b></p> <p><b>200-250g prawns in their shell </b></p> <p><b>1 live crab (optional) </b></p> <p><b>175ml double cream </b></p> <p><b>1 handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped</b></p> <p>Place the mussels in a colander and rinse under the cold tap for a half-hour. Meanwhile, place a large, heavy pot on the stove. Scrub clean all the vegetables, then cut into thumb-sized pieces and put in the pot, along with all the other stock ingredients except the saffron. Add a litre of water, bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 30 minutes.</p> <p>Warm a large, handsome dish in the oven. Strain the stock through a sieve into another pot, saving the garlic but discarding all the other ingredients. With the back of a spoon, push the garlic through the sieve and into the strained liquid. Stir and return to the heat. Bring to the boil, add the saffron and simmer for five minutes.</p> <p>Cut the larger pieces of fish into manageable pieces. If a crab is to figure, kill it just before plunging it into the broth. To do this, flip the crab over on its back, pull back the exposed flap and insert a spike, driving it home with a bold thrust, thereby executing instant death. Remove the claws from the crab and quarter the carapace. Drop into the stock, along with the larger fish. Add the rest of the fish according to size, so that all are cooked at the same time - the mussels and prawns will need to go in last of all. If necessary, transfer any cooked fish to the pre-heated dish. Once all the fish is done, place it in the dish.</p> <p>Pour the cream into the stock, simmer for a minute or so, add salt and pepper as required, and stir in the parsley. Pour over the cooked fish, and serve with new potatoes or crusty bread.</p> <p><b> Chowder</b><br> It is a puzzle why Britain has no national fish soup or stew, surrounded as we are by water populated with the finest fish and shellfish in the world. Chowders are splendid, cheap, easy and open to a great many variations, so it is similarly puzzling as to why their appearance is so rare. <br></p> <p><b> 300g large waxy potatoes </b></p> <p><b>2 small onions </b></p> <p><b>50g unsalted butter </b></p> <p><b>160g coley or pollack fillet, cut into pieces </b></p> <p><b>1 handful each mussels and clams (optional) </b></p> <p><b>30g good streaky bacon, salt pork or pancetta </b></p> <p><b>350ml milk </b></p> <p><b>120ml double cream</b></p> <p><b>1 bayleaf </b></p> <p><b>1 handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped</b></p> <p>Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1cm cubes. Chop the onion and bacon into small pieces. In a large pot, melt the butter, and fry the bacon and onion until the onion has softened and coloured lightly.</p> <p>If using mussels and/or clams, add them to the pot now, along with a splash of water, and cover to steam the shellfish until they are all opened (discard any that do not do so). Tip the shellfish, onion and bacon into a colander over a bowl, to collect the juices, and return the empty pot to the stove.</p> <p>Rinse the cut potato of any excess starch, and add to the pot, along with the milk and any liquor from the shellfish. Add the bayleaf and a little pepper, and simmer until the potato is cooked. Return the bacon, onion and shellfish to the pot, along with the fish, and simmer for 10 minutes, until the fish is just cooked. Stir in the cream and parsley, and season. The chowder looks its best when served in a tureen.</p> <p><b> Fish Pie </b><br> Unlauded fish are great in a dish such as this. There are a few stages to this recipe, but the result is worth the effort. <br></p> <p><b> 2 large potatoes </b></p> <p><b>1 small head celeriac </b></p> <p><b>1kg mussels, scraped and bearded </b></p> <p><b>1kg pollack or coley fillet </b></p> <p><b>1 small onion </b></p> <p><b>1 clove garlic </b></p> <p><b>1 bayleaf </b></p> <p><b>25g unsalted butter </b></p> <p><b>1 glass white wine </b></p> <p><b>1 litre milk </b></p> <p><b>1 dssp Dijon mustard </b></p> <p><b>1 handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped </b></p> <p><b>lemon, juiced </b></p> <p><b>Salt and pepper</b></p> <p>For the crust</p> <p><b> 2 large potatoes </b></p> <p><b>2 large handfuls fresh breadcrumbs </b></p> <p><b>25g freshly grated Parmesan</b></p> <p><b>25g unsalted butter</b></p> <p>Scrub all the potatoes, place them in a pot of lightly salted water, and bring to the boil. Peel the celeriac and cut into pieces. Place the mussels in a colander and rinse under running cold water for half an hour. Remove any skin and bones from the fish and cut the flesh into chunks.</p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/ gas mark 5. Heat a large pot, and in it fry the onion and garlic in butter, along with the bayleaf. Tip in the mussels and wine, cover and steam gently until all the shells are opened (discard any that do not open). Strain through a colander held over a bowl. Return the pot to the stove, add the celeriac and milk, and simmer gently, stirring from time to time to prevent sticking, until the celeriac is cooked through. Drain and peel the potatoes, add half to the celeriac mixture and pur\u00e9e. Shell the mussels, discarding the shells. Keep the cooked onion.</p> <p>Carefully pour the mussel liquor into the pur\u00e9e, leaving any grit behind. Stir in the mustard, parsley, cooked onion, mussels, seasoning and lemon juice. Put the fish in a handsome ovenproof dish and pour over the sauce. Break up the remaining potatoes into small pieces. Lay these over the top of the fish, then liberally strew with breadcrumbs.

      "bodyText": "Why do we all rush through the weeks before Christmas, preparing like mad for the Big Day, and give so little thought to its Eve? While the great part of Europe, all the way from Scandinavia to Greece, celebrates Christmas Eve with rituals ranging from ancient and simple to elaborate and sumptuous, we Brits tend to ignore it altogether. We may, of course, be tired of the whole ghastly ritual by then, anyway; or perhaps it has something to do with old legends of witchcraft, of spirits being appeased and put to rest through revels, and of shaman-like rituals to banish evil beasties. The great festive jollities of Europe are many, but my gut feeling is that such traditions do not travel well, and are therefore best enjoyed on their own turf. There is, however, no reason whatsoever to miss out on all of the fun - and as a great deal of that fun revolves around food, then setting forth a fine supper of fish on Christmas Eve seems eminently sensible rather than radical or revolutionary. Indeed, traditionally, the meal before mass on Christmas Day has meat proscribed, which has given the devout on Christmas Eve a leaning towards a light meal - and that usually, although not necessarily, has consisted of fish. It's a fine notion, to my mind, and it seems such a pity that we British have never developed a festive fish dish of our own - come to that, we have no national fish dish of any kind, with the notable exception of the deep-fried affair with chips. Even that former magnifico of the Christmas sideboard, smoked salmon, which was for so long a Yuletide staple because it is expensive and easy to serve, has become largely debased in recent years, and is now more the preserve of the hopelessly naff. But I must stop: a harangue is really not what is required here. The point is to spread the great affair that is Christmas over a few days, not cram it all into a single, gut-busting meal. All that effort for just one day seems plain silly when diet and dignity are far better served by spreading it out over a longer period. It also expands the time available for pleasure - and there is no need to mention the digestive benefits of eating thus. So, I can think of no better way to set such a remarkable change in our national habits in train than by serving up a great dish of fish cooked in a pie or a chowder or a stew on Christmas Eve. All recipes serve six. Fish Stew Use as many or as few varieties of fish and shellfish as you want. Flatfish such as halibut, plaice and brill are particularly good cooked this way. I advocate making a simple stock in which the fish is later cooked on the bone. For the stock 4 medium leeks 5 medium onions 3 small carrots 4 sticks celery 1 bulb fennel (if available) 1 whole bulb garlic 1 bayleaf 1 small sprig thyme 12 black peppercorns bottle good white wine Generous pinch saffron For the stew 1.2kg white fish, on the bone 300g mussels, scraped and bearded 200-250g prawns in their shell 1 live crab (optional) 175ml double cream 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped Place the mussels in a colander and rinse under the cold tap for a half-hour. Meanwhile, place a large, heavy pot on the stove. Scrub clean all the vegetables, then cut into thumb-sized pieces and put in the pot, along with all the other stock ingredients except the saffron. Add a litre of water, bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 30 minutes. Warm a large, handsome dish in the oven. Strain the stock through a sieve into another pot, saving the garlic but discarding all the other ingredients. With the back of a spoon, push the garlic through the sieve and into the strained liquid. Stir and return to the heat. Bring to the boil, add the saffron and simmer for five minutes. Cut the larger pieces of fish into manageable pieces. If a crab is to figure, kill it just before plunging it into the broth. To do this, flip the crab over on its back, pull back the exposed flap and insert a spike, driving it home with a bold thrust, thereby executing instant death. Remove the claws from the crab and quarter the carapace. Drop into the stock, along with the larger fish. Add the rest of the fish according to size, so that all are cooked at the same time - the mussels and prawns will need to go in last of all. If necessary, transfer any cooked fish to the pre-heated dish. Once all the fish is done, place it in the dish. Pour the cream into the stock, simmer for a minute or so, add salt and pepper as required, and stir in the parsley. Pour over the cooked fish, and serve with new potatoes or crusty bread. Chowder It is a puzzle why Britain has no national fish soup or stew, surrounded as we are by water populated with the finest fish and shellfish in the world. Chowders are splendid, cheap, easy and open to a great many variations, so it is similarly puzzling as to why their appearance is so rare. 300g large waxy potatoes 2 small onions 50g unsalted butter 160g coley or pollack fillet, cut into pieces 1 handful each mussels and clams (optional) 30g good streaky bacon, salt pork or pancetta 350ml milk 120ml double cream 1 bayleaf 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1cm cubes. Chop the onion and bacon into small pieces. In a large pot, melt the butter, and fry the bacon and onion until the onion has softened and coloured lightly. If using mussels and/or clams, add them to the pot now, along with a splash of water, and cover to steam the shellfish until they are all opened (discard any that do not do so). Tip the shellfish, onion and bacon into a colander over a bowl, to collect the juices, and return the empty pot to the stove. Rinse the cut potato of any excess starch, and add to the pot, along with the milk and any liquor from the shellfish. Add the bayleaf and a little pepper, and simmer until the potato is cooked. Return the bacon, onion and shellfish to the pot, along with the fish, and simmer for 10 minutes, until the fish is just cooked. Stir in the cream and parsley, and season. The chowder looks its best when served in a tureen. Fish Pie Unlauded fish are great in a dish such as this. There are a few stages to this recipe, but the result is worth the effort. 2 large potatoes 1 small head celeriac 1kg mussels, scraped and bearded 1kg pollack or coley fillet 1 small onion 1 clove garlic 1 bayleaf 25g unsalted butter 1 glass white wine 1 litre milk 1 dssp Dijon mustard 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped lemon, juiced Salt and pepper For the crust 2 large potatoes 2 large handfuls fresh breadcrumbs 25g freshly grated Parmesan 25g unsalted butter Scrub all the potatoes, place them in a pot of lightly salted water, and bring to the boil. Peel the celeriac and cut into pieces. Place the mussels in a colander and rinse under running cold water for half an hour. Remove any skin and bones from the fish and cut the flesh into chunks. Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/ gas mark 5. Heat a large pot, and in it fry the onion and garlic in butter, along with the bayleaf. Tip in the mussels and wine, cover and steam gently until all the shells are opened (discard any that do not open). Strain through a colander held over a bowl. Return the pot to the stove, add the celeriac and milk, and simmer gently, stirring from time to time to prevent sticking, until the celeriac is cooked through. Drain and peel the potatoes, add half to the celeriac mixture and pur\u00e9e. Shell the mussels, discarding the shells. Keep the cooked onion. Carefully pour the mussel liquor into the pur\u00e9e, leaving any grit behind. Stir in the mustard, parsley, cooked onion, mussels, seasoning and lemon juice. Put the fish in a handsome ovenproof dish and pour over the sauce. Break up the remaining potatoes into small pieces. Lay these over the top of the fish, then liberally strew with breadcrumbs. Melt the butter and pour over the crust and top with the Parmesan. Bake for 30-40 minutes until well coloured and crisp, with the fish just cooked through. Brandade There is many a brandade made with mashed potato - I suspect this is merely to bulk out the simple dish. This version omits the spud. 1.5kg dried salt cod 1 small sprig thyme 1 bayleaf 2 cloves garlic 1 lemon 200ml double cream 300ml good olive oil Black pepper It is essential that the cod be soaked for at least 24 hours and that the water be changed at least three times. Once the excess salt has been removed, place the fish in a pot along with the thyme and bayleaf. Cover with cold water, bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and leave the fish to cook within the liquor. Peel the garlic, flatten with a knife, chop very fine and place in a bowl.

Next, slowly add the cream, until the mixture is a thick paste. Add lemon juice to taste, along with lots of pepper, then heat gently over a low flame. This is best spread on thinly sliced bread that has been dotted with olive oil and baked golden in the oven. \u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.",

      "body": "<p>One of the earliest complaints that was laid against the Superplonk column, and indeed the books, was the absence of romance. Reviewers (far more than readers) beefed that the hard-headed rating of wines by awarding them points out of 20 - and on a strict value-for-money basis, too - left no room for wine's soft side. I had no soft side, it was alleged.</p> <p>Nor do I, as a wine writer. I leave the fluffy side to others. Wine writers, you see, are of two sorts.

And then, finally, you swig. You swill the liquid around the mouth and breathe in air, so that this liquid is aerated and all those thousands of tastebuds, each in differently oriented sectors (one is designed to recognise salinity, for example, another alkalinity, another sweetness, and so on), can provide the sensory data for the critic to examine what is called the mid-palate of the wine.</p> <p>Some of the wine is permitted to make contact with the back of the throat, but only the very smallest amount is allowed to proceed from there and venture down the gullet - this is essential for the proper study of the finish of the wine. Then, the wine is ejected, the price tag noted, and several seconds left to elapse while all these various sensations are studied and written up as critic mulls over the impression the wine has left behind.</p> <p>As part of a working day, a critic such as myself may taste more than a hundred wines (I rarely think it wise to venture, critically, over 170), and will write up copious notes describing each one, perhaps rating it, and also providing ideas as to how each one will perform with food and which dishes it is best suited for.</p> <p>He or she (wine-writing favours use of \"she\", not least because women have finer noses) may take the price of each wine into consideration when passing judgment, or she may simply judge the wine as wine. For myself, I cannot judge a wine without knowing its price, which is an added incentive to concentrate solely upon it and nothing else. This inability to divorce the price of a bottle from its rating appals some romantics, and I seem to be alone among critics in that I have always rated wines in this way. It is extremely concentrated analysis, since it requires the taster, in arriving at a rating, rapidly to run through similar-performing wines at all price levels and thus arrive at a sensible, value-for-money judgment.</p> <p>Such a critic pays no heed to the religion of the wine maker, or to the location of the grapes, or to the colour of the skins of the grapes, or to what fabulous stories may be attached to the vineyard's or the wine grower's reputation. These things may be taken in to account after the wine has hit the spittoon -and, indeed, they will have to be if the wine is a reputed colossus with an appropriate price tag, because such a wine will have had to have hit those thousands of tastebuds with some considerable impact and complexity if this reputation is a worthy one and not simply a fable as, sadly, is so often the case.</p> <p>In splendid Lilliputian fashion, then, we wine writers are either top-enders or bottom-enders.

Reviewers (far more than readers) beefed that the hard-headed rating of wines by awarding them points out of 20 - and on a strict value-for-money basis, too - left no room for wine's soft side. I had no soft side, it was alleged. Nor do I, as a wine writer. I leave the fluffy side to others. Wine writers, you see, are of two sorts. And what sort of wine writer you are depends on which end of the bottle you start from.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The first time I met Margaret Drabble, I was 14, she was 28, and I loathed her. Or, if not her precisely, then everything she represented. She had come to my school, the City of London - all girls, direct grant - to read from her latest novel, The Millstone, her third, and to lecture us on the novelist's life. Lecture - because in those days, it was 1968, no one \"talked\" to young women about their lives, their longing and their fear. </p> <p>The object, of course, benign in its intent, was to fill us girls with the right kind of ambition. To inculcate in us the notion that, if you lived life like a novel, turning it over page by page, paying attention to its proper structure and chronology - school, university, career, marriage, kids - then somehow you could sidestep life's meanness. </p> <p>There would have been teachers present in that lecture hall - Miss Woolley, Miss Church, the Misses B and M Nash - every one of them a spinster, and some of them so old, or so the rumour went, as to have lost fianc\u00e9s in the first world war. I know now, though I neither understood nor could have appreciated it then, that we represented to these women their lost chance. \"Their girls\" - because we were all, always, \"their girls\", even the naughty ones - would in the phraseology of the day \"have it all\". </p> <p>Did this make them resent us? Does resentment account for their sometime unkindnesses. Or did their thin-lipped strictness conceal some fear for us? Fear that the expectations they so assiduously filled us with would return to frustrate us. Probably a bit of both. Today, I can look with tenderness on the diligence with which they went about trying to prepare us for a world that their own lives could never comprehend. But God, how we mocked them then. The circumscribed narrowness of their lives and their ambition. Funny to think that, in fear and longing, we matched them, and so exactly. Even then. </p> <p>Drabble, at that place and in that time, seemed to me one of them: ie, one of the ones sent to thwart us. Oh, we knew all about ambition. Hadn't Melinda Camber, only that year, achieved a scholarship to Oxford and Cambridge both - a feat so unparalleled in the school's history that we were all given a day off, a privilege normally reserved for the death of royalty? </p> <p>Drabble couldn't know, as she stood before us, the Newnham scholarship girl with her starred first in Eng Lit, her husband, her three babies and her books - increasing, as it seemed, logarithmically year on year - that her shining example represented not limitless opportunity but our own imminent failure. Or was I the only one to go to bed that night consumed with despair? </p> <p>It must have been some time not long after this that I helped myself to a bottle of pills, found at home, and had my stomach pumped in the local hospital. (Nothing to do with Ms Drabble; more, as I recollect, with a pretty boy named Bob.) I include this detail only because it seemed significant when the 14-year-old and 28-year-old met again, more than 25 years on. Very different people, anyone would suppose. But not me. I clung to my image of Ms Drabble as though it meant something. </p> <p>It was 1995 when I met her again, and she was what? Still, in my mind, the successful author, with the unbroken trajectory, who made me fear for my future. I was on time. She was early. Making me feel, unreasonably I thought, as though I were late. So intractable these early impressions. (\"And you never do catch up,\" she told me, a propos of her older sister, Antonia, much later on. \"You are always behind. No matter how hard you try. She will always be older, cleverer, in higher heels.\") Impressions can be as hard as fact, as solid as stone. </p> <p>It was then that she told me about her own suicide attempt, more than 25 years earlier - and, indelibly now in my mind, the same year as my own. She was living in Stratford-upon-Avon, with her then husband, the actor Clive Swift, and their three small children, trying to write, trying to be a mum and a wife. I can hear her reciting the details, chattily - droll and light as she always is when discussing something serious. \"Not a serious attempt, a bottle of paracetamol ...\" The stomach pump. \"Not nice at all. And the doctors aren't nice to you. Still, maybe that's a good thing. I didn't try that one again.\" </p> <p>And realising as she talked that, all those years ago, I'd got it all wrong - every single detail, from the polished pumps, to the remembered stiffness in the voice, to the self-satisfied hauteur. I wrote about the attempted suicide in the article I was writing. Not because it was an interesting anecdote, but because no one was ever going to get Ms Drabble so wrong again, not if I could help it. A short time after publication, she wrote to me. She didn't mind at all the reference to suicide, she said, but she thought I might be interested to know that her daughter Becky had been upset, \"a) that I'd once attempted suicide; b) that I'd told anyone - well, particularly the readers of a newspaper.\" She ended jauntily. \"I move house this month and am in the middle of packing half a lifetime's rubbish.\" She is right. We take everything with us. Even, or maybe especially, the things we don't want. </p> <p>She hadn't told her children. Of course she hadn't. A second's reflection should have told me that. No mother is going to sit down and tell their children that once, however long ago, while they were all tucked up safe in bed, she had had a moment's doubt, lost her nerve. Isn't it the mother's role to evince no vulnerability? Isn't that the reasonable expectation? I didn't know then that her own mother used to threaten suicide. She wrote to her mother about it once, saying, \"Don't do it. It's not fair.\" </p> <p>Two things I learned from Margaret Drabble. That we repeat. And that we get things wrong. And then, if we are really unlucky, we repeat getting things wrong. But, if we are lucky, she says, we can break the repetition: \"I don't think it can be done by willpower. Even the imagination can't release you. But sometimes an arbitrary factor can come crashing in and change the picture. I call that luck.\" </p> <p>Her first bit of luck, she says, was marrying Clive. Because he was different from her. Volatile, emotional, noisy. \"There was a lot of screaming.\" She had never known screaming. \"Only nagging.\" It was a passionate love affair, and that's important, she says, for the children to know that they came from passion. </p> <p>And then there was a passionate falling out of love, ending in divorce in 1975. \"There was a long time when I didn't love him. But now I do.\" People don't say this, or not often. That love can shrink, shrivel up and regrow. They say \"I love\" or \"I don't love\", as if love exists only in the present, coming from nowhere, going nowhere, when, in fact, how we love is as rooted in our history as are our genes. </p> <p>I think I am right in saying that Drabble believes this. Her wonderful latest novel, The Peppered Moth - named after a species where some adapt to a changing environment and survive, and others don't and become extinct (luck rather than judgment, no doubt) - focuses on this idea. It takes as its central metaphor a scientific entity - mitochondrial DNA, the genetic material that is unique to women. This stands for the transmission of female behavioural patterns from one generation to the next. Which sounds a bit contorted, but then, as Drabble points out, \"It is only a metaphor. You don't have to worry about it too much.\" </p> <p>Incidentally, in the course of her research - she loves research, particularly anything of an archaeological bent - she went off to see a certain Professor Sykes of Oxford University, who spends much of his time looking for the last Neanderthal link. He took her DNA and she is still awaiting his call. \"But I don't think I can be the Neanderthal link, or I would have heard from him, wouldn't I?\" </p> <p>The basic line of the book can be put simply. Do we become our mothers? And, if not, how do we break the pattern and escape? It is about memory and perception - how much can we rely on our impressions, particularly the ones that crowd our early years? And, to use the book metaphor again, how on earth are we to keep the chapters of our lives in order - to stop those bits that belong properly in the beginning from spilling over and wrecking our story? It can't be done. </p> <p>And in the novel Drabble doesn't attempt to do it, she moves freely across time and across the three generations of mothers and daughters who make up her story, subverting any idea of a linear structure whenever she sees fit. Life isn't threaded like a string of beads. It is more like the pile of marbles with which she and Antonia used to play as children in the attic of their unmarried aunt Phyll, baubles that crash and collide. \"God,\" Drabble says, \"marbles were so beautiful then.\" And sometimes, no doubt, she would pick one up, put it in her pocket, take it out of the game, and that would become hers, for keeps. </p> <p>I have long considered Margaret Drabble subversive - based on that early impression, perhaps, but I prefer to think more rooted in fact. She has been described by some critics as suburban, domestic, preoccupied with middle-class mores - maternal, even in her writing. Whoever came up with the idea that this was safe? We forget that in the early 60s - when she was writing her first three novels, A Summer Bird-cage, The Garrick Year, The Millstone, all centred on the tensions in the lives of high-powered girls like her then self - it was unusual to scrutinise the solipsistic nature of young motherhood, that first generation of women who believed they could, by following their instincts, have it all. </p> <p>The conflict between instinct and morality, the rough intrusion of accident into our lives, the weakness of human will - this most especially - has been her subject. And always rooted in time and place. In the 80s, she produced her disaffected trilogy, The Radiant Way, A Natural Curiosity and The Gates of Ivory, continuing the decision she had taken earlier to abandon heroines, which she has not reversed. She has also recently edited and revised what is probably the most scholarly and excellent work of reference to be produced in recent times, The Oxford Companion to English Literature. </p> <p>The Peppered Moth is her most subversive book yet, though you don't realise until the end quite the extent of this. In an afterword, she tells the reader that it is, in fact, a book about her own mother, that she has drawn from letters and memoirs to produce her fiction. She has also \"filled out with invention\". She talks about her bias towards her father, \"a good man\". And the impossibility of loving an unlovable woman. She once said to me, \"I don't know if I loved my mother.\" </p> <p>And the deep sadness of the book is that, perhaps, she does know. She wrote the book, she says, in an effort to reclaim her mother. \"I hoped that, by going back into her childhood, by reading her school reports, by revisiting the houses we lived in, perhaps I might understand what she was really like. And that some emotional blockage would be released. To tell you the truth, I innocently hoped that through it I would feel more love.\" </p> <p>This could be read in different ways. As an act of compassion towards a woman now 16 years dead. And, indeed, towards herself - to forgive herself for not having loved this woman as, perhaps, we all feel we should love our mothers. It could be read, more harshly, as an act of appropriation - to secure this elusive woman, her mother, and the mother of Antonia, and of Helen and Richard, her siblings, once and all for herself. </p> <p>I have tried to think myself into the position of her sisters and brother, reading the book, and have wondered if I would resent it. And I think I would. I have also wondered whether this is what Margaret has always done - possessively, jealously, drawn her mother to herself. It was Margaret who was there, at her mother's home in Suffolk, just hours after she died peacefully in her sleep. I listened to her describe it, with that kind of grim humour she has. </p> <p>\"She had just watched the last part of The Jewel In The Crown ... got to the end of the series and went to bed and died ... On her bedside table were her glasses and an open book, The Shogun, which she was reading. I don't think she would have wanted me to know that ... she hadn't got to the end of that.\" Did you kiss her, I asked her. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I did.\" I would have been jealous of that. </p> <p>But, so many buts. There is real generosity in the book. She could have written it as a memoir, Drabble says, but she decided not to. One of the things about writing a novel rather than a memoir, she explains, is that you can generalise. \"Say, this is the kind of thing mothers do to their daughters. And I could look at her as part of her generation.\" A generation of women, she says, \"who grew up between the wars, who were educated into expectations, and who were then frustrated, sent back into the domestic world\". So, a woman, a mother who was unique and not unique. </p> <p>What do you select in a biography that is of significance - because it's all selection, isn't it, editing bits in, bits out, to suit our purposes? It seems to me, for example, of some importance that Drabble's mother, Kathleen Marie Bloor, always known as Marie, miscarried her first child. \"I believe she was quite anxious to have a baby at this point.\" And so Antonia became that much-wanted, that longed for first baby. </p> <p>\"My mother meant to have my sister, she didn't mean to have me.\" Drabble relates how her mother used to say to her, \"Who in their right mind would have had a baby in June 1939, with a war coming?\" Who in their right mind would say this to their child? But then, Marie was the first of two sisters, Marie and Phyllis - this seems significant, too. In that family, the Bloor family, things divided neatly. Marie was the clever one. \"I think my mother really was extraordinarily bright.\" Phyll the dunce. \"Though not nearly as stupid as my mother used to like to say she was.\" </p> <p>Imagine, then, being Margaret. Determined not to turn into her much derided aunt? \"Not much chance of that.\" Or imagine being Marie. The girl who had grown up without an intellectual companion. Maybe even felt guilty about so easily outstripping her little sister. Now, with her own first two daughters, Marie could easily and consciously have set out to make her daughters intellectual equals - redress the perceived wrong. This might account for the fierce competition that the mother encouraged in her daughters. \"I wish I understood,\" Drabble says. </p> <p>It's not purely perverse to say that I like the sound of Marie Bloor. She talked to her daughters, \"all the time\". She told them stories about her life. \"Endlessly.\" It's hard not to feel sympathy with this working-class Yorkshire girl, so clever that she got a scholarship to Newnham. Who arrived in Cambridge only to be put firmly in her place by Miss Strachey, principal of Newnham and Lytton Strachey's sister. </p> <p>\"My mother goes in all chirpy, she has been teacher's pet all her life ... and Ms Strachey says, 'A scholarship girl, I see. Will you be able to afford the fees?' And my mother, who thought that she had done so brilliantly well, suddenly realised that there was another standard by which she was being judged. And by which she felt she was being judged for the rest of her life.\" Her mother wanted vengeance, clearly - she was right to want it - and she got it in her brilliant daughters, all three at Newnham. She may also have wanted to protect her daughters. They were all taught to speak \"proper English, not Yorkshire\", though Marie spoke with a Yorkshire accent to the end of her life. </p> <p>Her daughter, quite rightly, on the issue of class, wants to protect her. Don't you find, Margaret says, \"that there's something about Bloomsbury that sets your teeth on edge - something to do with its unawareness of other people's hang-ups and vulnerabilities. That is Virginia Woolf's great weakness. She couldn't understand people's social difficulties. When she saw them, she didn't recognise them for what they were.\" </p> <p>When she was researching this novel, Drabble went back to Newnham and looked through all the archival material relating to her mother's intake at Cambridge. \"Her contemporaries were, as you'd expect, the children of mostly middle-class people - lawyers and the like. There were only a small handful like her from humble homes.\" Drabble's dad, the son of a Yorkshire sweet manufacturer, \"from a slightly better home than hers\", was a lawyer. </p> <p>Did her parents love one another? This is the question that runs through the book. Maybe it is every child's question, or every unhappy child's question. Because, if we don't proceed from love, then ... what? She says there are no letters in existence between her parents. Odd, because her father was away for the war, and later in life he travelled a great deal on his own. So one has to assume either that they didn't write - though her father wrote to his friend frequently and Drabble has these letters - or that the correspondence was destroyed. Otherwise, her mother seems to have kept everything. Clearing out her grandparents' house, Drabble came across the thesis that her mother wrote on George Gissing. \"Unfortunately, I think we left it in the garage.\" She never read it? \"No.\" </p> <p>Looking up the Gissing entry in The Oxford Companion, I learn that Gissing married \"two proletarian girls\". And, in the words of his friend HG Wells, \"He felt that to make love to any woman he could regard as a social equal would be too elaborate, so he flung himself at a social inferior whom he expected to be grateful.\" Gissing, incidentally, was a Quaker, as was Drabble's father. And as was her mother later in life, when she renounced atheism. \"She was quite unusual,\" Drabble says. \"In certain things she was very bold.\" </p> <p>Gratitude, a euphemism for resentment, as William Blake wrote. Is this enough to explain her mother's unkindness to her father? She was at least as bright as him; brighter, probably. \"Possibly,\" Drabble says. \"He was very bright.\" She married him at 25, then quite late in life. On the shelf? \"I think,\" Drabble says, \"she married him at a time when her career wasn't going as well as she had hoped.\" </p> <p>After Newnham, unable to get a job - it was 1929, no one could get a job - she returned to her home town of Mexborough, which she hated, and was teaching at her old school. The ignominy of it: the golden girl ... And doing no better than Phyll, who was a primary school teacher. When their father became a circuit judge in Northumberland, she insisted she hated the north and made him move south. To Sevenoaks. A kind of purgatory, I would have thought. </p> <p>With a dearth of documentary evidence, we have three things to fall back on her parents' love for each other. Drabble's own testimony: \"She was horrible to him.\" Her mother's two university pals, who both wrote to Margaret saying, \"They had a very happy early marriage.\" And something her father once said of her mother, late in life: \"She is not the sweetheart she once was.\" That, Margaret says, \"was the understatement of all time\". The timing of this is impeccable. And she gets it from her mother, I am sure. To be funny and to be a sweetheart, even if a lapsed sweetheart, is pretty irresistible. You can love people like this. </p> <p>Maybe, I said to her, none of us gets the mother we feel we deserve. She laughed. \"Why would we deserve better than we get?\" No, she said. No. \"My mother was my mother, and I am undeniably a product of my mother. I would have liked my mother to have been happy. But whatever she was, she was my mother and there is no other mother I could have had. So I don't deserve a better mother. I feel intimately and closely connected to that woman who was my mother.\" </p> <p>Maybe, I said, this is what we call love. \"Could be. I suppose it could be.\" Then she rejects the idea. \"But she drove me so mad - it's hard to give it that name.\" And then. \"I think the sorrow I feel for her could be love.\" Sometimes, she says, she wonders, \"What justifies writing fiction at all?\" And answers her own question. \"To find this common territory of loss.\" </p> <p>It seems appropriate, somehow, that the last word in this should go to Margaret's only daughter, Becky. Becky, who loved her grandmother and who loves her mother. Amazing that she should be able to express this so simply. Margaret, of course, is exasperating. It is part of the maternal role. Becky has no children. \"I said to her, 'Do you realise, after you my mitochondrial DNA will become extinct?' \" (Her own mother, Marie, couldn't have expressed it better, by which I mean worse.) \"So what?\" she reports Becky as responding. </p> <p>\"The funny thing,\" Margaret says, \"is that my mother was very nice to my children. She used to let them get into bed with her in the morning, which is more than she ever did with us.\" It strikes me that it's no coincidence that the novel spans three generations. You need this for some kind of understanding. The set-up, the tension and the forgiveness. Anyway, Becky wrote a poem: On Remembering Getting Into Bed With Grandparents. Though the object of the poem is singular - ie, her grandmother. </p> <p>It's amazing that we got that far, loveless </p> <p>As you were supposed to be ... </p> <p>\"Loveless,\" the daughters said ... </p> <p>Yet ... </p> <p>That's it really.

      "bodyText": "The first time I met Margaret Drabble, I was 14, she was 28, and I loathed her. Or, if not her precisely, then everything she represented. She had come to my school, the City of London - all girls, direct grant - to read from her latest novel, The Millstone, her third, and to lecture us on the novelist's life. Lecture - because in those days, it was 1968, no one \"talked\" to young women about their lives, their longing and their fear. The object, of course, benign in its intent, was to fill us girls with the right kind of ambition. To inculcate in us the notion that, if you lived life like a novel, turning it over page by page, paying attention to its proper structure and chronology - school, university, career, marriage, kids - then somehow you could sidestep life's meanness. There would have been teachers present in that lecture hall - Miss Woolley, Miss Church, the Misses B and M Nash - every one of them a spinster, and some of them so old, or so the rumour went, as to have lost fianc\u00e9s in the first world war. I know now, though I neither understood nor could have appreciated it then, that we represented to these women their lost chance. \"Their girls\" - because we were all, always, \"their girls\", even the naughty ones - would in the phraseology of the day \"have it all\". Did this make them resent us? Does resentment account for their sometime unkindnesses. Or did their thin-lipped strictness conceal some fear for us? Fear that the expectations they so assiduously filled us with would return to frustrate us. Probably a bit of both. Today, I can look with tenderness on the diligence with which they went about trying to prepare us for a world that their own lives could never comprehend. But God, how we mocked them then. The circumscribed narrowness of their lives and their ambition. Funny to think that, in fear and longing, we matched them, and so exactly. Even then. Drabble, at that place and in that time, seemed to me one of them: ie, one of the ones sent to thwart us. Oh, we knew all about ambition. Hadn't Melinda Camber, only that year, achieved a scholarship to Oxford and Cambridge both - a feat so unparalleled in the school's history that we were all given a day off, a privilege normally reserved for the death of royalty? Drabble couldn't know, as she stood before us, the Newnham scholarship girl with her starred first in Eng Lit, her husband, her three babies and her books - increasing, as it seemed, logarithmically year on year - that her shining example represented not limitless opportunity but our own imminent failure. Or was I the only one to go to bed that night consumed with despair? It must have been some time not long after this that I helped myself to a bottle of pills, found at home, and had my stomach pumped in the local hospital. (Nothing to do with Ms Drabble; more, as I recollect, with a pretty boy named Bob.) I include this detail only because it seemed significant when the 14-year-old and 28-year-old met again, more than 25 years on. Very different people, anyone would suppose. But not me. I clung to my image of Ms Drabble as though it meant something. It was 1995 when I met her again, and she was what? Still, in my mind, the successful author, with the unbroken trajectory, who made me fear for my future. I was on time. She was early. Making me feel, unreasonably I thought, as though I were late. So intractable these early impressions. (\"And you never do catch up,\" she told me, a propos of her older sister, Antonia, much later on. \"You are always behind. No matter how hard you try. She will always be older, cleverer, in higher heels.\") Impressions can be as hard as fact, as solid as stone. It was then that she told me about her own suicide attempt, more than 25 years earlier - and, indelibly now in my mind, the same year as my own. She was living in Stratford-upon-Avon, with her then husband, the actor Clive Swift, and their three small children, trying to write, trying to be a mum and a wife. I can hear her reciting the details, chattily - droll and light as she always is when discussing something serious. \"Not a serious attempt, a bottle of paracetamol ...\" The stomach pump. \"Not nice at all. And the doctors aren't nice to you. Still, maybe that's a good thing. I didn't try that one again.\" And realising as she talked that, all those years ago, I'd got it all wrong - every single detail, from the polished pumps, to the remembered stiffness in the voice, to the self-satisfied hauteur. I wrote about the attempted suicide in the article I was writing. Not because it was an interesting anecdote, but because no one was ever going to get Ms Drabble so wrong again, not if I could help it. A short time after publication, she wrote to me. She didn't mind at all the reference to suicide, she said, but she thought I might be interested to know that her daughter Becky had been upset, \"a) that I'd once attempted suicide; b) that I'd told anyone - well, particularly the readers of a newspaper.\" She ended jauntily. \"I move house this month and am in the middle of packing half a lifetime's rubbish.\" She is right. We take everything with us. Even, or maybe especially, the things we don't want. She hadn't told her children. Of course she hadn't. A second's reflection should have told me that. No mother is going to sit down and tell their children that once, however long ago, while they were all tucked up safe in bed, she had had a moment's doubt, lost her nerve. Isn't it the mother's role to evince no vulnerability? Isn't that the reasonable expectation? I didn't know then that her own mother used to threaten suicide. She wrote to her mother about it once, saying, \"Don't do it. It's not fair.\" Two things I learned from Margaret Drabble. That we repeat. And that we get things wrong. And then, if we are really unlucky, we repeat getting things wrong. But, if we are lucky, she says, we can break the repetition: \"I don't think it can be done by willpower. Even the imagination can't release you. But sometimes an arbitrary factor can come crashing in and change the picture. I call that luck.\" Her first bit of luck, she says, was marrying Clive. Because he was different from her. Volatile, emotional, noisy. \"There was a lot of screaming.\" She had never known screaming. \"Only nagging.\" It was a passionate love affair, and that's important, she says, for the children to know that they came from passion. And then there was a passionate falling out of love, ending in divorce in 1975. \"There was a long time when I didn't love him. But now I do.\" People don't say this, or not often. That love can shrink, shrivel up and regrow. They say \"I love\" or \"I don't love\", as if love exists only in the present, coming from nowhere, going nowhere, when, in fact, how we love is as rooted in our history as are our genes. I think I am right in saying that Drabble believes this. Her wonderful latest novel, The Peppered Moth - named after a species where some adapt to a changing environment and survive, and others don't and become extinct (luck rather than judgment, no doubt) - focuses on this idea. It takes as its central metaphor a scientific entity - mitochondrial DNA, the genetic material that is unique to women. This stands for the transmission of female behavioural patterns from one generation to the next. Which sounds a bit contorted, but then, as Drabble points out, \"It is only a metaphor. You don't have to worry about it too much.\" Incidentally, in the course of her research - she loves research, particularly anything of an archaeological bent - she went off to see a certain Professor Sykes of Oxford University, who spends much of his time looking for the last Neanderthal link. He took her DNA and she is still awaiting his call. \"But I don't think I can be the Neanderthal link, or I would have heard from him, wouldn't I?\" The basic line of the book can be put simply. Do we become our mothers? And, if not, how do we break the pattern and escape? It is about memory and perception - how much can we rely on our impressions, particularly the ones that crowd our early years? And, to use the book metaphor again, how on earth are we to keep the chapters of our lives in order - to stop those bits that belong properly in the beginning from spilling over and wrecking our story? It can't be done. And in the novel Drabble doesn't attempt to do it, she moves freely across time and across the three generations of mothers and daughters who make up her story, subverting any idea of a linear structure whenever she sees fit. Life isn't threaded like a string of beads. It is more like the pile of marbles with which she and Antonia used to play as children in the attic of their unmarried aunt Phyll, baubles that crash and collide. \"God,\" Drabble says, \"marbles were so beautiful then.\" And sometimes, no doubt, she would pick one up, put it in her pocket, take it out of the game, and that would become hers, for keeps. I have long considered Margaret Drabble subversive - based on that early impression, perhaps, but I prefer to think more rooted in fact. She has been described by some critics as suburban, domestic, preoccupied with middle-class mores - maternal, even in her writing. Whoever came up with the idea that this was safe? We forget that in the early 60s - when she was writing her first three novels, A Summer Bird-cage, The Garrick Year, The Millstone, all centred on the tensions in the lives of high-powered girls like her then self - it was unusual to scrutinise the solipsistic nature of young motherhood, that first generation of women who believed they could, by following their instincts, have it all. The conflict between instinct and morality, the rough intrusion of accident into our lives, the weakness of human will - this most especially - has been her subject. And always rooted in time and place. In the 80s, she produced her disaffected trilogy, The Radiant Way, A Natural Curiosity and The Gates of Ivory, continuing the decision she had taken earlier to abandon heroines, which she has not reversed. She has also recently edited and revised what is probably the most scholarly and excellent work of reference to be produced in recent times, The Oxford Companion to English Literature. The Peppered Moth is her most subversive book yet, though you don't realise until the end quite the extent of this. In an afterword, she tells the reader that it is, in fact, a book about her own mother, that she has drawn from letters and memoirs to produce her fiction. She has also \"filled out with invention\". She talks about her bias towards her father, \"a good man\". And the impossibility of loving an unlovable woman. She once said to me, \"I don't know if I loved my mother.\" And the deep sadness of the book is that, perhaps, she does know. She wrote the book, she says, in an effort to reclaim her mother. \"I hoped that, by going back into her childhood, by reading her school reports, by revisiting the houses we lived in, perhaps I might understand what she was really like. And that some emotional blockage would be released. To tell you the truth, I innocently hoped that through it I would feel more love.\" This could be read in different ways. As an act of compassion towards a woman now 16 years dead. And, indeed, towards herself - to forgive herself for not having loved this woman as, perhaps, we all feel we should love our mothers. It could be read, more harshly, as an act of appropriation - to secure this elusive woman, her mother, and the mother of Antonia, and of Helen and Richard, her siblings, once and all for herself. I have tried to think myself into the position of her sisters and brother, reading the book, and have wondered if I would resent it. And I think I would. I have also wondered whether this is what Margaret has always done - possessively, jealously, drawn her mother to herself. It was Margaret who was there, at her mother's home in Suffolk, just hours after she died peacefully in her sleep. I listened to her describe it, with that kind of grim humour she has. \"She had just watched the last part of The Jewel In The Crown ... got to the end of the series and went to bed and died ... On her bedside table were her glasses and an open book, The Shogun, which she was reading. I don't think she would have wanted me to know that ... she hadn't got to the end of that.\" Did you kiss her, I asked her. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I did.\" I would have been jealous of that. But, so many buts. There is real generosity in the book. She could have written it as a memoir, Drabble says, but she decided not to. One of the things about writing a novel rather than a memoir, she explains, is that you can generalise. \"Say, this is the kind of thing mothers do to their daughters. And I could look at her as part of her generation.\" A generation of women, she says, \"who grew up between the wars, who were educated into expectations, and who were then frustrated, sent back into the domestic world\". So, a woman, a mother who was unique and not unique. What do you select in a biography that is of significance - because it's all selection, isn't it, editing bits in, bits out, to suit our purposes? It seems to me, for example, of some importance that Drabble's mother, Kathleen Marie Bloor, always known as Marie, miscarried her first child. \"I believe she was quite anxious to have a baby at this point.\" And so Antonia became that much-wanted, that longed for first baby. \"My mother meant to have my sister, she didn't mean to have me.\" Drabble relates how her mother used to say to her, \"Who in their right mind would have had a baby in June 1939, with a war coming?\" Who in their right mind would say this to their child?

To celebrate the festivities, the store has a delightful alternative to cava or champagne: Prosecco Zonin (16 points out of 20, \u00a34.99), a sparkling wine from Italy. One of the world's great unsung bubbly wine bargains, it is deliciously dry with a hint of strawberry. Also at Booths is Jordan Chardonnay 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a38.49), from South Africa, which can also be found at Waitrose, Unwins and Wine Cellar. It has melon-and-lime yoghurt fruit with a hint of walnut - quite yummy. The 99 vintage is not in the same class. </p> <p>Majestic has an abundance of bubblies, notably the current blend of Yellowglen Pinot Noir Chardonnay, from Australia, which is superb. Rating 16 points and costing \u00a38.49, this is a classy, subtly rich wine of some style - and if you buy six or more bottles, the price drops to \u00a36.37. Also at Majestic, as well as Oddbins and Safeway, is Mamre Brook Cabernet Shiraz 1996 (16 points, \u00a36.99), from Australia, which is at its peak of savoury smoothness and richness. Bulk purchase brings the price down to \u00a35.99. Two further festive reds at Majestic are from the great Rhne house of Guigal. Its basic Ctes du Rhne 1998 (16 points, \u00a36.99) is a rich and svelte performer on the tastebuds, offering character with finesse, which you can get for \u00a35.99 if you buy two bottles or more. Unwins and Oddbins have it, too. Guigal's 1997 Gigondas, meanwhile, is a classic, parading hedgerow-sweet, dark, herby, subtly mineral-edged fruit of complexity and texture. It rates 16.5 points and is on offer at \u00a311.99 until January 29. </p> <p>At Oddbins there is Wirra Wirra RSW Shiraz 1997 (18 points, \u00a314.99, Fine Wine Stores only), from Australia. It's a world-class specimen, elegant, huge, potent yet polite. Chteau de l'Engarran Quetton Saint-Georges Coteaux de Languedoc 1998 (17.5 points, \u00a38.99) is rather exquisitely refined at first smell and sip, then a hint of a rugged, misspent youth appears to garnish the soft plummy fruit with bite, tannin and longevity of performance. Fabre Montmayor Merlot Lujan de Cuyo 1997 (17 points, \u00a36.99), from Argentina, is beautifully complete in its harmony of fruit, acids and tannins and immediately seductive. Merryvale Cabernet Sauvignon 1997 (17 points, \u00a313.99), from California, is an alcoholic (14.5%) subterfuge, since there are merlot, cabernet franc and petit verdot grapes in there, too. All that said, this duplicitous blend lies gorgeously on the tastebuds with a polish recalling Lafite in a soft year. </p> <p>At Safeway we have Knappstein Cabernet/Merlot 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a37.99, selected branches), from Australia, which is brightly textured, replete with polished plummy flavours and with an elegant finish. Errazuriz Merlot Reserva Don Maximiano Estate 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a39.99, Oddbins has it, too), from Chile, is like drinking, or perhaps chewing, a soft velvet glove suffused with essence of cassis. Jean Louis Denois Mourvedre/Grenache Vin de Pays d'Oc 1998 (17 points, \u00a35.99) is stunningly well textured with potent fruit of complexity and minor grandeur, combining rich herbs and lovely warm tannins. Evans &amp; Tate Shiraz 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a38.99, selected branches) is nutty and figgy with concentrated weight on the finish. </p> <p>Sainsbury's has Danie de Wet 'Call of the African Eagle' Chardonnay Reserve 2000 (17 points, \u00a36.99, 140 branches), a very delicate, subtle, stealthy artefact that is consummately delicious and nutty (with a very vague echo of peaches and cream), fresh yet textured and gently rich, and it finishes with aplomb. This is an assured, understated wine of great class. It also has Petaluma Bridgewater Mill Shiraz 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a38.49, 180 branches), from Australia, with a chewy, coal-edged texture, deep and rich and softly spicy. It flaunts plums, blackcurrants and a touch of leather, along with delicious tannins. </p> <p>Finally, an announcement (at last!): <a href=\"http://www.Superplonk.com\"> Superplonk.com</a> has now gone live!

These people are to be sympathised with. I expect they will write in to complain about Julie Burchill's objections to Mr Lennon. I personally have greater regret about the passing of Ian Dury. Gerry Duffett Hythe, Southampton Well done Ms Burchill, an excellent piece on Lennon (December 9). But to suggest that McCartney wrote any decent songs? Now that is offensive. Tim Davies Wotton-Under-Edge, Glos John Lennon was a deeply flawed individual who happened to be a wonderful singer and composed a considerable number of excellent, often moving songs, giving pleasure to many millions. Julie Burchill is a deeply flawed individual who once wrote in the Face that Stalin's victims 'deserved to die because they were not good communists'. I don't suppose she can sing, either.

      "body": "<p><strong> January 19 2000</strong> </p> <p>New York. Peter Shaffer talks vividly about Gielgud and Brecht and Oscar Wilde and the celebrated West End impresario, Binkie Beaumont: \"I gave him [Beaumont]the manuscript of The Royal Hunt of the Sun, and I'd written a line that became slightly notorious, a stage direction about the Spanish army. The line was: 'They now climb the Andes.' I was staying the weekend at Binkie's and John Perry was there, the partner, and they had referred not at all to the manuscript, but I overheard John Perry describing it to Binkie: 'Well dear, they climb up the Andes, do they? And what do they do then? They climb down them, dear. Fancy.' And I thought, I don't think this is quite the management for this play.\" </p> <p>He talks about the endurance of the power of theatre, of the reticent Chichester audience leaning forward, with their hands palms upwards willing Robert Stephens as Atahualpa to rise from the dead. </p> <p><strong> January 21</strong> </p> <p>Coulsdon mental hospital for a piece about Antonin Artaud, the French actor, director, visionary - and madman. The hospital has been disused for two years; it must have housed hundreds of patients, now beneficiaries of the \"care in the community\" policy, which gave the mentally ill the franchise of the open streets. Mind you, if you weren't mad when you came here... This is a sick building, soaked in misery. Its infinitely long, tiled corridors have been made even more depressing by the addition of brown paint for a TV series called Psychos. Roger, the director, is anxious about using the word \"magus\" in my piece about Artaud. I fight for it on the grounds of dumbing up, but he's probably right on the grounds of pretentiousness. In Berlin I had the same argument over the word \"dialectic\". </p> <p><strong> January 24</strong> </p> <p>It's the Irish episode, we're in the foyer of the Savoy hotel, it's 6.30 in the morning and I'm talking about Oscar Wilde, who ran up a large bill here - feasting with panthers in the bedrooms and dining with Bosie in the Grill Room. The hotel staff are wholly helpful, but we have to be out before 8.30 as they have a delegation from the MoD arriving for a meeting with a Slovenian military delegation. Or the other way round. </p> <p>On to Blacks' club in Dean Street, then Lobb's the bootmaker. In Lobb's the clock has stopped in 1951, redecorated by the previous Mr Lobb for the Festival of Britain. It smells of age and leather and money, but is agreeably immune from marketing, management, advertising and postmodernism. </p> <p>The present Mr Lobb shows me round: the shop is flanked on one side by display cases including two tiny pairs of shoes - one belonging to Queen Victoria, the other to Haile Selassie. On the other side, blue-aproned shoemakers rasp away at wooden lasts for new customers. A book displays the outlines of feet from many kings, maharajahs, film stars, thriller writers, and, infamously, Horatio Bottomley [the first world war jingoist, subsequently a fraudster] and Guy Burgess. No doubt Jeffrey Archer has his shoes made here, but the ever-courteous and ever-discreet Mr Lobb merely smiles gnomically when I suggest it. </p> <p>He takes me below stairs, where thousands of lasts are stacked on shelves like scrolls in a catacomb. In corners of the basement sit more shoemakers working away with welt beaters, heel irons, waist irons, burnishing irons, lasting pincers, skiving knives, breasting knives, prick stitchers, scrapers, fudge wheels, crow wheels, channel openers, bones and last hooks, which draw the lasts from the finished shoes - which normally take about a year to make and cost \u00a32,000. Next door is Lock's the hatter, equally revered, even if a little more prone to merchandising and modernising than Lobb's. They have a bill for Mr Wilde who had to leave the country in a hurry. [It was paid this month on the centenary of Wilde's death by Royston du Maurier, an artist from Worthing.] I end the day being filmed walking down Old Compton Street - not quite Wilde territory, this, but you get the idea. </p> <p><strong> January 25</strong> </p> <p>Off to interview director Peter Gill about DH Lawrence's plays, which Peter directed definitively at the Royal Court in the late 60s. Peter is a Welsh working-class Catholic; he's like a highly intelligent, worldly and charming Jesuit priest. He talks in a maze of sub-clauses, which spiral round the subject, sparking observations about the romanticism of British theatre, the shapelessness of great plays, and the ineradicable presence of class in our culture. </p> <p>Night. As the audience emerges from the National Theatre, I'm talking to the camera about the history of the campaign to establish it. A familiar face appears, accompanied by a week-old baby in a carry-cot: it's John Caird, director of Candide, which has just had its last night. John says he wondered who it was talking so knowledgeably about theatre history. I wish. I'm intrigued by a couple who stand looking at a leaflet for the Christmas show, Honk the Ugly Duckling. \"Look, Sheryl,\" says the man. \"It's got frogs in it. We must come to that.\" </p> <p><strong> January 26</strong> </p> <p>Manchester, to do a piece about Miss Horniman, who was an Edwardian heiress to a tea fortune - a handsome woman with an artistic bent, who smoked in public, wore trousers to ride a bicycle and offered a large sum of money to an actress and fellow member of her occult group, Florence Farr, for the purpose of putting on plays. Farr commissioned WB Yeats - also a member of the occult group - which is how Miss Horniman ended up as the money behind the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. Florence Farr, incidentally, believed in daily sex as a health tonic. George Bernard Shaw was a beneficiary of this regime, as was Yeats, after years of petitioning. </p> <p>Miss Horniman supported the Abbey for many years, but her enthusiasm was dampened by Yeats's scorn for her artistic ambitions and her disapproval of home rule. She didn't like the Irish and they didn't like her, so she withdrew her money and initiated the English Repertory Movement by buying the Manchester Gaiety theatre and endowing a group of playwrights, who wrote for the north about the north. They were called the \"Manchester School\", and included Harold Brighouse (Hobson's Choice) and Stanley Houghton (Hindle Wakes). </p> <p>I'm 150 feet up on a cast-iron fire escape on the side of a factory in Ancoats that is as old in years as it's high. It's very cold, I have mild vertigo - a faint desire to plummet towards the ground - and have ample time to reflect on film-making. I've directed a dozen films for television and invariably found the process wildly invigorating: every minute of the day is crammed with interest - strategy, decisions, the picture, the sound, the logistics. Every day spent making a film produces a finished piece of the puzzle, a complete element, whereas rehearsals in the theatre stretch out forever like a snake of molecules. But acting for film is like being in the army: hours of waiting followed by a few minutes of action. And often feeling like a glove puppet. When you're directing film, the enemy is time; when you're acting, it's boredom. </p> <p>Later I do a piece to camera under a railway bridge, arching above me in a film-noirish sweep. A spectator stops for a moment, fascinated by the film camera and lights. I start my piece with the words \"George Bernard Shaw . . .\" at which point the spectator scarpers as if his trousers were on fire. </p> <p><strong> January 27</strong> </p> <p>I have a similar experience walking up a steep terraced street in Eastwood in Nottinghamshire. \"What yer filming?\" says a passing woman. \"DH Lawrence.\" \"Oh, him,\" she says with a vinegary face. Eastwood has been comprehensively heritaged: follow the blue line on the pavements and it will take you to all the principal sites of veneration. The afternoon brings me to one of my stations of the cross, the auditorium of Nottingham Playhouse. To remember a time in the 70s when a regional theatre did mostly new plays, as we did, with a permanent company in a changing repertoire, seems like recalling the roaring twenties. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Eyre's Changing Stages, the book of his recent television series, is published by Bloomsbury, price \u00a330.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Royal Shakespeare Company makes its own contribution to the current monarchy debate with an exciting revival of the three parts of Henry VI at The Swan in Stratford-upon-Avon. Even if Shakespeare never ultimately questions the necessity of kingship, he shows the chaos that follows dynastic uncertainty. And, since the trilogy tours to America, you assume local audiences will see its relevance to their own constitutional crisis: that a lame-duck head of state opens the way to civil dissent. </p> <p>Harold Bloom dismisses the trilogy as an exercise in Marlovian rhetoric that no longer lives. Absolutely untrue. The three plays work theatrically and appeal to audiences increasingly fatigued by the narrowing down of the Shakespeare canon. If you are going to do the plays, you should also do them as a complete set finally incorporating Richard III. </p> <p>In 1963 and 1988, the RSC chopped the tetralogy into three plays dubbing them, respectively, The Wars of the Roses and The Plantaganets. Here Michael Boyd rightly follows the far better example of Terry Hands in 1978 - by presenting the Henry VI plays virtually uncut: the result is an awesome day-long event in which the actors' commitment is matched by that of the audience. Boyd and his designer, Tom Piper, have also taken radical steps to unify the stylistically variable plays. For a start they have re-aligned The Swan so that the stage-floor is an irregular oblong. Above all, they have realised the virtue of the building lies in its height. Actors are constantly scaling ladders and ropes to remind us of the vertical nature of siege-warfare. Characters descend from the flies encased in picture frames. Red and white feathers fall from on high symbolising both fluctuating fortunes, fickleness and human transience. </p> <p>What is striking is how these plays change their meaning with the years. In the Hall-Barton Wars of the Roses they expressed a 1960s scepticism about the political process itself - the dominant image was of a diamond-shaped council table around which the embattled lords argued. Obviously, the plays remain acute studies in the nature of power. But Boyd treats the trilogy as, above all, an extended essay on time. </p> <p>The young, callow Henry VI is haunted by his grandfather's usurpation of the throne. But the characters also exist in a nightmare present. And death is seen as an entrance as well as an exit: corpses rise up to be guided offstage by a mysterious gatekeeper only to re-appear, like the Duke of York, in the thick of battle. It's a very Eliotesque idea, that time present and time past are both present in time future. </p> <p>But, however much Boyd unifies the plays visually, there's no getting away from the simple fact that Part Two is the trilogy's undisputed high point. The first Part, dealing with French wars and domestic factions, is vivid enough. But in Part Two Shakespeare displays that ability to embrace court and commoners that he was later to deploy, with even greater genius, in the Henry IV plays. At court the nobles conspire against the Duke of Gloucester; their disputes are mirrored by battles between Horner, an armourer, and his servant (delightfully named Peter Thump). We also get the Kentish rebellion of Jack Cade: as Jake Nightingale's Cade here swings on a trapeze above his followers, we are reminded that - far from being a republican - he sees himself as a legitimate claimant to the throne pre-emptively dubbing himself Sir John Mortimer. </p> <p>Everyone in these plays is reaching for what they call \"the glorious gold\". The only person who understands the hollowness of power is the throne's occupant, Henry VI. Much has been made of the casting of David Oyelowo in the role, the first black actor to play a Shakespearean king at Stratford. Far more important is the moral strength Oyelowo brings to the part. His king may be militarily weak and politically fallible but he has the inner certainty of the believer; and when he rounds on his wife for defending her lover - \"Ungentle Queen to call him gentle Suffolk\" - it is with fearsome wrath. In the midst of the carnage, Oyelowo exudes a specific gravity. </p> <p>I heard mumbles in some quarters that the casting could not match the great days of The Wars of the Roses. But this is, on average, a much younger company and one whose strength resides in its collective purpose. Fiona Bell, significantly doubling as Joan la Pucelle and Margaret of Anjou, moves from trull to termagant with crop-haired, iron-souled determination.

      "bodyText": "The Royal Shakespeare Company makes its own contribution to the current monarchy debate with an exciting revival of the three parts of Henry VI at The Swan in Stratford-upon-Avon. Even if Shakespeare never ultimately questions the necessity of kingship, he shows the chaos that follows dynastic uncertainty. And, since the trilogy tours to America, you assume local audiences will see its relevance to their own constitutional crisis: that a lame-duck head of state opens the way to civil dissent. Harold Bloom dismisses the trilogy as an exercise in Marlovian rhetoric that no longer lives. Absolutely untrue. The three plays work theatrically and appeal to audiences increasingly fatigued by the narrowing down of the Shakespeare canon. If you are going to do the plays, you should also do them as a complete set finally incorporating Richard III. In 1963 and 1988, the RSC chopped the tetralogy into three plays dubbing them, respectively, The Wars of the Roses and The Plantaganets. Here Michael Boyd rightly follows the far better example of Terry Hands in 1978 - by presenting the Henry VI plays virtually uncut: the result is an awesome day-long event in which the actors' commitment is matched by that of the audience.

      "body": "<p>My friend Joanne Good drives what I sometimes think must be the best morning radio show in the country. Broadcasting as Breakfast Live In Brighton, six days a week from 6-9am, on BBC Southern Counties Radio (\"serving Surrey, Sussex and northeast Hampshire\" - I don't know why, but the specificness of that \"northeast Hampshire\" always makes me laugh), she is tireless and shameless, with the personality of a hydraulic pump crossed with a go-go girl, even at that time of morning. </p> <p>She jumps from topic to totally unrelated topic - from the Panzer Mansion, the Brighton mansion that was full of midgets between the wars, to the girly 70s habit of writing pop stars' names on one's rough book at school - with all the enthusiasm of a nine-year-old let loose in Claire's Accessories. </p> <p>To make things bittersweet, Joanne has an enemy, one \"E Thompson\", who despises her so much that she will not even do her the courtesy of writing to her on a nice piece of notepaper, and instead sends her harsh missives on the back of cancelled cheques and various other paper waste. Rose Red to Joanne's Snow White, \"E Thompson\" is like Anne Robinson with PMT, and seems obsessed with raining on Joanne's parade by correcting her grammar, picking on her pronunciation and generally letting her know what a silly girl she is. </p> <p>Because Joanne is so used to being popular, she reads these letters with a voice full of disbelief and doubt, almost as if she thinks it is one of her friends having a laugh. And then, never missing a beat, she is immediately back to her old bouncy self, uninhibitedly scampering up and down the keyboard of her mind like a cartoon kitten trying to play the piano. Forget the endless sea, sodomy and members of Supergrass that make Brighton such a joy; Joanne's radio show alone is all the reason you need to move here. </p> <p>But there is a downside to Joanne. Not one, but two people inhabit her body. She was, and still is, an actress - if you watched Crossroads in the early 80s, you'll remember her as Carole Sands, the waifish blonde beauty who worked as a mechanic at the motel garage, predating Kylie Minogue's Charlene by at least half a decade. These days, it's Casualty and panto, but to hear her go on you'd think it was Chekhov and Pinter. </p> <p>Alongside Joanne the Broadcaster, who is down to earth, vivid and witty as you could wish, there lives Joanne the Luvvie, who is frankly unbearable. Last week, discussing her forthcoming appearance in Cinderella alongside Julian Clary and a huge pumpkin, she compared acting to \"being in the trenches during the first world war, and about to go over the top\". For once, she wasn't joking. </p> <p>Actors have always been preposterous people, but such military metaphors take their folly to new heights of deliciousness. Who can forget Liz Hurley stating that she would never date \"a civilian\" (ie, a non actor), because they wouldn't be able to deal with the pressure? (The pressure of being caked in make-up and having their photo taken, this must be.) </p> <p>Then there are people who should know better encouraging thesps to think of themselves as warriors - Richard Eyre, talking about Jason Robards in the Guardian last week, gushed that, \"like a campaign veteran, he speaks of the music of Long Day's Journey in the tones of a man who loves the smell of napalm in the morning\". Ew! </p> <p>Surely the word \"punter\" would be a better choice than civilian? Being an actor is far more like being a prostitute than a soldier: you get hired for the way you look, and you show private parts of your body to strangers, which I've never heard was the way to make it big in the SAS - the Navy, maybe. I've never got an answer from even the most know-all of my regular detractors/correspondents, so I'll ask the question again - when Demi Moore shows her breasts on film or Sharon Stone her vagina, what, exactly, makes them artists and not sex industry workers, albeit highly astute, excellently paid sex industry workers? I'm not being snotty; I'm genuinely interested. </p> <p>As with prostitutes, the money actors get for their goods goes down as they age past their peak of physical perfection. Just look at Arnie, down from $20m to $15m a picture, with a promise of only $8m if the next one lays an egg. Also, one feels a good deal more contempt for well-bred and educated types - your Vanessas and Emmas, who lower themselves to it - than for the cheap and cheerful Martines and Patsys, who might otherwise be wasting their beauty in Woolworths. Of course, some men go to prostitutes not for sex but to hear them tell their sad story - take a bow, Melanie Griffith, whose films no one has been to see for a decade but whose tale of woe, broadcast daily on the internet, has made her hot once more. </p> <p> There are exceptions to every rule - Kathy Burke, Rachel Weisz and Jude Law, for example, are the very models of dignity, restraint and perception, both as people and as artists - but, generally, actors are horrifically silly. So, are they actors because they're silly, or silly because they're actors? Whatever, \"stress\" - that great mantra alibi of the silly at work - has been adopted by actors as by no other group of workers; not nurses, not teachers, not people who work for Marco Pierre White. </p> <p>Remember Stephen Fry running out on his colleagues on that first night and sending a bleating letter to the papers about the stress and strain he was under? Yeah, like the secret police came in the middle of the night, forced him out of bed at gunpoint and made him do all those acting jobs and commercials that earned him so many millions of pounds. Just what is so stressful about a prolonged, incredibly well-paying game of Let's Pretend? They're still at it. \"It was a nightmare,\" says Cold Feet's John Thompson of filming three TV shows. \"I was becoming a multiple personality!\" As Larry Olivier said to Dustin Hoffman after the latter had been agonising over how to play a scene, \"Ever thought of acting, dear boy?\" </p> <p>Lots of actors like to play up their social conscience; many even claim to be socialists (\"socialist actor\" must rate with \"friendly fire\" as one of the best oxymorons of all time). Without fail, they talk about what hard work play-acting is, with not a thought to what an insult such jabber is to miners, fire fighters and the like, or even to people with profoundly boring jobs. </p> <p>The fact is that being an actor, or a writer, or a footballer, or anything you enjoy, is not a pain, it's a privilege. If it does cause you so much stress, maybe that's because you're not very good at it. (It is interesting that those, such as Hurley and Fry, who moan the most about how hard acting is are indeed spectacularly bad at it.) Perhaps stress is just Mother Nature's way of telling us that we're crap at our jobs and should try something new.</p>",

Alongside Joanne the Broadcaster, who is down to earth, vivid and witty as you could wish, there lives Joanne the Luvvie, who is frankly unbearable. Last week, discussing her forthcoming appearance in Cinderella alongside Julian Clary and a huge pumpkin, she compared acting to \"being in the trenches during the first world war, and about to go over the top\". For once, she wasn't joking. Actors have always been preposterous people, but such military metaphors take their folly to new heights of deliciousness. Who can forget Liz Hurley stating that she would never date \"a civilian\" (ie, a non actor), because they wouldn't be able to deal with the pressure? (The pressure of being caked in make-up and having their photo taken, this must be.) Then there are people who should know better encouraging thesps to think of themselves as warriors - Richard Eyre, talking about Jason Robards in the Guardian last week, gushed that, \"like a campaign veteran, he speaks of the music of Long Day's Journey in the tones of a man who loves the smell of napalm in the morning\". Ew! Surely the word \"punter\" would be a better choice than civilian? Being an actor is far more like being a prostitute than a soldier: you get hired for the way you look, and you show private parts of your body to strangers, which I've never heard was the way to make it big in the SAS - the Navy, maybe. I've never got an answer from even the most know-all of my regular detractors/correspondents, so I'll ask the question again - when Demi Moore shows her breasts on film or Sharon Stone her vagina, what, exactly, makes them artists and not sex industry workers, albeit highly astute, excellently paid sex industry workers? I'm not being snotty; I'm genuinely interested. As with prostitutes, the money actors get for their goods goes down as they age past their peak of physical perfection. Just look at Arnie, down from $20m to $15m a picture, with a promise of only $8m if the next one lays an egg. Also, one feels a good deal more contempt for well-bred and educated types - your Vanessas and Emmas, who lower themselves to it - than for the cheap and cheerful Martines and Patsys, who might otherwise be wasting their beauty in Woolworths. Of course, some men go to prostitutes not for sex but to hear them tell their sad story - take a bow, Melanie Griffith, whose films no one has been to see for a decade but whose tale of woe, broadcast daily on the internet, has made her hot once more. There are exceptions to every rule - Kathy Burke, Rachel Weisz and Jude Law, for example, are the very models of dignity, restraint and perception, both as people and as artists - but, generally, actors are horrifically silly. So, are they actors because they're silly, or silly because they're actors? Whatever, \"stress\" - that great mantra alibi of the silly at work - has been adopted by actors as by no other group of workers; not nurses, not teachers, not people who work for Marco Pierre White. Remember Stephen Fry running out on his colleagues on that first night and sending a bleating letter to the papers about the stress and strain he was under? Yeah, like the secret police came in the middle of the night, forced him out of bed at gunpoint and made him do all those acting jobs and commercials that earned him so many millions of pounds. Just what is so stressful about a prolonged, incredibly well-paying game of Let's Pretend? They're still at it. \"It was a nightmare,\" says Cold Feet's John Thompson of filming three TV shows. \"I was becoming a multiple personality!\" As Larry Olivier said to Dustin Hoffman after the latter had been agonising over how to play a scene, \"Ever thought of acting, dear boy?\" Lots of actors like to play up their social conscience; many even claim to be socialists (\"socialist actor\" must rate with \"friendly fire\" as one of the best oxymorons of all time). Without fail, they talk about what hard work play-acting is, with not a thought to what an insult such jabber is to miners, fire fighters and the like, or even to people with profoundly boring jobs. The fact is that being an actor, or a writer, or a footballer, or anything you enjoy, is not a pain, it's a privilege. If it does cause you so much stress, maybe that's because you're not very good at it. (It is interesting that those, such as Hurley and Fry, who moan the most about how hard acting is are indeed spectacularly bad at it.) Perhaps stress is just Mother Nature's way of telling us that we're crap at our jobs and should try something new.",

      "body": "<p>The Kandinskys are shown to perfect effect in the discreet lighting, likewise the Picassos, Van Goghs and Monets. So all is well in the gift shop at Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim museum in New York. All is well, too, at the box office of the institution that showed how to get them through the door when it gave the world The Art of the Motorcycle two and a half years ago. Now it has moved on - from oily rags to glad rags. Specifically, the main galleries at the Guggenheim, once home to 20th-century painting, are the latest franchise in the Giorgio Armani chain. </p> <p>The Guggenheim is becoming something of a franchise itself, with its flagship on Fifth Avenue, another in SoHo, one more Frank Gehry job going through the planning hoops on the Lower East Side, Gehry's much-admired previous work in Bilbao, satellites in Berlin and Venice, a new gallery being built in Las Vegas, and the prospect of museums in Rio de Janeiro and a second Brazilian city. Impressive, even if the latest artist to show on Fifth Avenue has this many shops in the US alone. </p> <p>\"The Guggenheim is no longer a serious art institution,\" argues Hilton Kramer, art critic of the New York Observer. \"It has no aesthetic standards and no aesthetic agenda. It has completely sold out to a mass-market mentality that regards the museum's own art collection as an asset to be exploited for commercial purposes.\" By these standards, the Guggenheim is not alone. The Brooklyn Museum of Art is running a hip hop exhibition, Boston has one on guitar design, and even the august Metropolitan Museum of New York had a show last year that venerated rock stars' stage kit. </p> <p>No one suggests that Sean \"Puffy\" Coombes, the estate of Leo Fender or the designer of Tina Turner's miniskirts resorted to supra-artistic techniques to help their works find a platform in unaccustomed surroundings. But Armani, whose exhibition of 400 outfits runs until January 17, is different. Thomas Krens, the museum's director, says he approached the designer about the enterprise, but agrees that word of an Armani pledge of $15m is not far off the mark. \"A friendship has grown between us and Mr Armani, and he and his Italian corporation have indicated significant interest in aiding the museum in some of its projects,\" says Krens. \"It's a non-story. Who do you get to support an institution? People who have relationships with it.\" </p> <p>Armani's relationship with the people who wear his clothes is a big part of the Guggenheim show - how he makes them feel powerful, casual, loose and structured, all at the same time. Never mind if you start thinking after a while that when you've seen one suit, you've seen them all. This is like an Oscars award ceremony where the stars sent along their outfits while they stayed at home and watched it on television. Armani's connection with the movies is strong, as we are often reminded, starting with American Gigolo, starring Richard Gere. \"The seductive elegance of the anti-hero's clothing became legend,\" are the words chosen to explain the significance of a crumpled jacket. The exhibition guide reiterates: \"The film... marked the beginning of a long and fruitful history of collaboration on films, most recently John Singleton's remake of Shaft.\" </p> <p>The fact that neither of these exactly rivals Citizen Kane passes without mention, submerged in the lustre of the garments and their peripherals. There are pictures by 25 photographers, film of models on the catwalk, advertising campaigns through the years and descriptions of collections couched in language that makes you wonder whether one might be described as a cheeky little number. But all these are outdone by the room given over to the stars, where, for example, the 1988 number run up for Eric Clapton is presented with the kind of reverence the man himself reserves for his guitar. </p> <p>Robbed of their contents, these clothes do reveal something about the stars for whom they were created: the size of their celebrity is often in inverse proportion to their physique. Matt Damon appears to be one of the few fully-grown men in the movies. The suits are mounted on a plinth several inches off the ground, and still Russell Crowe barely makes it to the height of the average shoulder. Robert De Niro is granted a couple of inches more than the rest between the platform and the bottom of his trouser legs, to give the impression that he is merely small. That, perhaps, is the height of fashion.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Kandinskys are shown to perfect effect in the discreet lighting, likewise the Picassos, Van Goghs and Monets. So all is well in the gift shop at Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim museum in New York. All is well, too, at the box office of the institution that showed how to get them through the door when it gave the world The Art of the Motorcycle two and a half years ago. Now it has moved on - from oily rags to glad rags. Specifically, the main galleries at the Guggenheim, once home to 20th-century painting, are the latest franchise in the Giorgio Armani chain. The Guggenheim is becoming something of a franchise itself, with its flagship on Fifth Avenue, another in SoHo, one more Frank Gehry job going through the planning hoops on the Lower East Side, Gehry's much-admired previous work in Bilbao, satellites in Berlin and Venice, a new gallery being built in Las Vegas, and the prospect of museums in Rio de Janeiro and a second Brazilian city. Impressive, even if the latest artist to show on Fifth Avenue has this many shops in the US alone. \"The Guggenheim is no longer a serious art institution,\" argues Hilton Kramer, art critic of the New York Observer. \"It has no aesthetic standards and no aesthetic agenda. It has completely sold out to a mass-market mentality that regards the museum's own art collection as an asset to be exploited for commercial purposes.\" By these standards, the Guggenheim is not alone. The Brooklyn Museum of Art is running a hip hop exhibition, Boston has one on guitar design, and even the august Metropolitan Museum of New York had a show last year that venerated rock stars' stage kit. No one suggests that Sean \"Puffy\" Coombes, the estate of Leo Fender or the designer of Tina Turner's miniskirts resorted to supra-artistic techniques to help their works find a platform in unaccustomed surroundings. But Armani, whose exhibition of 400 outfits runs until January 17, is different. Thomas Krens, the museum's director, says he approached the designer about the enterprise, but agrees that word of an Armani pledge of $15m is not far off the mark. \"A friendship has grown between us and Mr Armani, and he and his Italian corporation have indicated significant interest in aiding the museum in some of its projects,\" says Krens. \"It's a non-story. Who do you get to support an institution? People who have relationships with it.\" Armani's relationship with the people who wear his clothes is a big part of the Guggenheim show - how he makes them feel powerful, casual, loose and structured, all at the same time. Never mind if you start thinking after a while that when you've seen one suit, you've seen them all. This is like an Oscars award ceremony where the stars sent along their outfits while they stayed at home and watched it on television. Armani's connection with the movies is strong, as we are often reminded, starting with American Gigolo, starring Richard Gere. \"The seductive elegance of the anti-hero's clothing became legend,\" are the words chosen to explain the significance of a crumpled jacket. The exhibition guide reiterates: \"The film... marked the beginning of a long and fruitful history of collaboration on films, most recently John Singleton's remake of Shaft.\" The fact that neither of these exactly rivals Citizen Kane passes without mention, submerged in the lustre of the garments and their peripherals. There are pictures by 25 photographers, film of models on the catwalk, advertising campaigns through the years and descriptions of collections couched in language that makes you wonder whether one might be described as a cheeky little number. But all these are outdone by the room given over to the stars, where, for example, the 1988 number run up for Eric Clapton is presented with the kind of reverence the man himself reserves for his guitar. Robbed of their contents, these clothes do reveal something about the stars for whom they were created: the size of their celebrity is often in inverse proportion to their physique. Matt Damon appears to be one of the few fully-grown men in the movies. The suits are mounted on a plinth several inches off the ground, and still Russell Crowe barely makes it to the height of the average shoulder. Robert De Niro is granted a couple of inches more than the rest between the platform and the bottom of his trouser legs, to give the impression that he is merely small. That, perhaps, is the height of fashion.",

      "body": "<p>This year Bernard Shaw is 144. It is of course, no age at all for the author of Back to Methuselah. That cycle of plays, searching like a Hubble telescope for some distant gleam of optimism, reaches forward to the year 31920, when human beings regularly live for several hundred years. But if GBS (he hated the name George and never used it) is nowhere near that Shavian prime yet, he is nevertheless in his element as the most unfashionable playwright and political thinker of today.</p> <p> For he was, like Ibsen, a sort of devil's advocate who, in the words of William Archer, Ibsen's English translator and Shaw's friend, \"goes about picking holes in every 'well-known fact'\". He will not allow complacency; he hates secondhand opinions; he attacks fashion; he continually challenges and unsettles, questioning and provoking us even when he is making us laugh. And he is still at it. No clich\u00e9 or truism of contemporary life is entirely safe from him. </p> <p>Shaw began this work soon after arriving in England at 20 - in the words of the Irish poet AE, \"as the last saint sent out from Ireland to save the world\". Apparently rising above his first 20 years of unhappiness and neglect in Dublin, and soldiering through the next 20 years of failure as a novelist and playwright in London, he set himself up in the last quarter of the 19th century as a professional man of genius. \"England had conquered Ireland,\" he explained, \"so there was nothing for it but to come over and conquer England.\" </p> <p>By the time Shaw and his wife Charlotte came to live in the Hert fordshire village of Ayot St Lawrence in 1906, GBS was 50 and gained a good deal of notoriety as an experimental dramatist and political pamphleteer. Whatever his subject, he advocated change. </p> <p>His arrival at the rectory was like the landing of a meteor. What on earth did this hitherto undisturbed agricultural community make of him? Those who had the vote were, in the main, Tory voters and they did not hold much with going to frivolous places like theatres. So they would have known GBS during those years before the first world war mainly through the newspapers. </p> <p>In his charming play, Village Wooing, partly inspired by Ayot St Lawrence, Shaw wrote: \"You must always let yourself think about everything. And you must think about everything as it is, not as it is talked about... We should never accept anything reverently without asking it a great many very searching questions.\" But this is what the villagers objected to. Surely there were some things best left alone, some things that did not bear thinking of, and a whole lot of things that, even in a democracy, you could never affect. The trouble about GBS was that he turned up every stone until there was no place on which you could safely place your foot. Think of everything in this searching and critical way and you would go mad.And certainly there were some people who thought GBS was mad. </p> <p>His views on education, for example, like his views on punishment - on all discipline apparently short of capital punishment itself, which he seemed to advocate as a sort of merciful euthanasia - would surely lead to chaos and anarchy if they were ever put into practice. He thought England's public schools for rich private people so socially divisive that he would like to see them all razed to the ground and the ground itself sown with salt. He thought the arts more important than the teaching of Latin, a thoroughly dead language that could surely be advocated only by those with a \"vested interest in torture\". Children, he concluded, \"should be compelled to do without adult guidance, and depend on themselves to the full limit of their resourcefulness\". </p> <p>England's out-of-date education system had led to a fossilised social system. Shaw was eager to upset our vacuum-packed categories of class and gender. As an active supporter of feminism, he attacked HH Asquith, the Liberal prime minister, for opposing the franchise for women. \"This is a very common opinion,\" Shaw wrote in a letter to the Times, \"that woman is not the female of the human species, but a distinct and inferior species, naturally disqualified from voting as a rabbit is disqualified from voting\". His tactics were to make this opinion politically disadvantageous. For how could you vote for the Liberal party and look any woman in the face again? </p> <p>Over forcible feeding of the suffragettes, Shaw was at his most savagely ironic and assertive. He argued that forcible feeding was illegal and a denial of a human being's fundamental rights. Herbert Gladstone, secretary of state for home affairs, gave him the opportunity of a gloriously Shavian rejoinder when Gladstone claimed that this intake of nourishment was not unpleasant. In a letter to the Times Shaw invited Gladstone to dinner. The Fabian Society, he promised, would give him a banquet. \"The rarest wines and delicacies shall be provided absolutely regardless of expense,\" he wrote.</p> <p> \"The only condition we shall make is that Mr Herbert Gladstone shall partake through the nose; and that a cinematograph machine be at work at the time registering for the public satisfaction the waterings of his mouth, the smackings of his lips, and other unmistakable symptoms of luxurious delight.\" </p> <p>The difficulty ordinary readers experienced with GBS was that they could seldom tell whether or not he was serious. And the difficulty Shaw had with the general reader, the reader from Ayot St Lawrence as it were, was that the more readable and entertaining he became the less seriously he was taken. This was a very English gambit: to give credence to nothing you enjoyed reading and to read nothing you didn't enjoy. </p> <p>In an article in the Clarion in the summer of 1907, The Gentle Art Of Unpleasantness, Shaw laid out the basis of his socialist programme. \"Everybody knows,\" he reminded readers, \"that the rich live by robbing the poor. That is why no gentleman every mentions it.\" But Shaw was not a gentleman. He believed that no tolerable social life was possible without the acceptance of equality as the condition of human association, and communism - which was public ownership of gas, water, banks, the lot - as the condition of human industry. Money should never be allowed to buy better health, longer life. </p> <p>When a country grew richer, there should be more money for all, not through some vague trickling-down process but through egalitarian distribution. He wanted to convert unequal private property into a literal commonwealth. </p> <p>That, quintessentially, was Shaw's socialist programme. And he was continually going round the country proclaiming it in public speeches. In May 1906, he spoke in Manchester. Among his audience was a young man later to become famous as a cricket correspondent and music critic, Neville Cardus. Shaw \"was not then regarded as that respectable,\" Cardus reminds us in his memoirs.</p> <p> \"As he stood on the platform, arms akimbo, in tweeds and still the red flame of socialism in his beard, he told us to burn down Manchester town hall and the cathedral. We revelled in the outrageousness of it, we had been repressed so long in our pubic discussions I was electrified by the tempo, charmed by the accent and twinkle, astonished that anybody could say so much without a manuscript, an hour of it and not a fumble . . .\" </p> <p>Shaw was perpetually ladling this frantic commotion into the national press which he regularly used as a platform from which to broadcast his ideas. He vigorously attacked vivisection, Shakespeare and charity (Can the Poor be Saved by the Pity of the Rich?). He championed photography and the value of swearing. He praised Jack the Ripper for drawing attention to social conditions in London's East End. He expounded the mysteries of \"socialism for millionaires\" - what would later be called \"champagne socialism\" - and he extolled the hygienic advantages of cremation over earth burial.</p> <p> \"The public does not acquire an inside knowledge of cemeteries until it dies and is buried,\" he explained. \"The objection to burial is not that people are occasionally buried alive; on the contrary buried people are quite unobjectionable whilst they survive. It is dead bodies that matter.\" </p> <p>He also attacked Christmas, representing himself as an admirer of Scrooge and the enemy of Santa Claus. The running battle between Shaw and Christmas lasted some 60 years, GBS having declared war on this \"orgy\" and \"nuisance\" in the 1880s. \"Christmas is best spent in some heathen country where the festival is unknown,\" he wrote. He urged people to forget it, and when asked by a newspaper how he liked to spend it, replied that he preferred not to spend it at all, since it was \"only something unpleasant that happens once a year. I am a lifelong advocate of its abolition.\" </p> <p>Looking back at the dramatic revolution that took place under Shaw and Granville Barker at the Royal Court theatre in Sloane Square between 1904 and 1907, it seems to have been an outstanding success, particularly among the young who went into the theatre as 19th-century aesthetes and came out 20th-century radicals. But the Court theatre was never a commercial success and Shaw himself was hardly recognised as a playwright by the critics. </p> <p>After he had written half a dozen plays, Max Beerbohm concluded that to produce even one of them \"would be almost impossible at any ordinary theatre\". And yet, in some perverse way, Shaw appeared to prosper. It was as if he got nourishment from all this invective and abuse. His first commercial success, a play we never hear of now called Fanny's First Play, uses many embattled themes from women's suffrage to police power and adds to the repertory of comic stage figures the idiotic theatre critic himself. The public loved it and it ran from 1911 to 1913 - that is, for more than 600 performances. The next year, following its premiere in Vienna, Pygmalion opened in London. It has remained the most popular of all his comedies: a genuinely pleasant play. </p> <p>So, to the confusion of his critics, Shaw in his 60s became the most famous and successful playwright in the world. For his film script of Pygmalion he won an Oscar; for his play Saint Joan, written five years after the war, he was awarded the Nobel prize for literature. But this was not the success Shaw wanted. He wanted influence, positive and subversive political influence, rather than a smothering of prizes. Indeed, his prize success coincided with the shrinking of his political influence. </p> <p>Before the war, he had been \"one of the leaders in the revolutionary movement of our youth\", Leonard Woolf wrote in his autobiography. By the mid-30s, Woolf was writing in the New Statesman \"There is no living man to whom the generations which came to maturity between 1900 and 1914 owed so much as to Mr Shaw... Nothing less than a world war could have prevented [him] from winning the minds of succeeding generations... ever since [the war] the barbarians have been on top.\" </p> <p>Who are these barbarians? Are they the theatre critics themselves? What they are claiming in their newspaper columns is that GBS is the barbarian. </p> <p>When Sam Walters staged The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles in the mid-1990s, the critics, realising that they were on unfamiliar territory, panicked. What were they to do? What they did was to read Shaw's preface, though not his warning that these prefaces had nothing to do with his plays. \"It is all more harmless Shavian fun you might think,\" objected Charles Spencer in the Daily Telegraph, until he added darkly, \"you read the preface.\" Once you read that you had the benefit of becoming (I use his word) \"nauseated\". He didn't review the preface, he reviewed the play. </p> <p>Benedict Nightingale had also read the preface. Writing in the Times, he drew his trusty sword of truth and struck a high moral note. Though Shaw's play was witty and diverting, GBS was actually doling out \"intellectual poison and death\", he wrote. He, and John Peter in the Sunday Times, reminded readers that Shaw had visited Soviet Russia in 1931. They did not mention his visits to India and Ceylon or his romance with Molly Tompkins on the Italian lakes where the real provenance of the play lies. They did not mention the literary parallels with Gilbert and Sullivan's Mikado or Shakespeare's The Tempest. </p> <p>They seized instead on two non-playwrights, Hitler and Stalin. \"No wonder the play went down well in Nazi Germany,\" wrote Michael Coveney, the Observer critic. But The Simpleton did not do well in Germany - it was never shown in Berlin. In fact a number of Shaw's plays were banned in Nazi Germany. His translator was Jewish and the Nazi theoretician Alfred Rosenberg placed Shaw among \"the army of half-bred artists\" that opposed the \"revived racial spirit\". </p> <p>In the late 19th and 20th centuries, eugenics was debated as heatedly as Darwinism itself. If you take some statements out of their historical context they can sound quite sinister. Let me give you one quote, from 1906, the year Shaw went to Ayot: </p> <p>\"The unnatural and increasingly rapid growth of the feeble-minded and insane classes, coupled as it is with steady restriction among all the thrifty, energetic and superior stocks, constitutes a national and race danger which it is impossible to exaggerate... the source from which the stream of madness is fed should be cut off and sealed off....\" </p> <p>This does sound unacceptable today. In fact it was written by Hitler's and Stalin's arch-enemy, Winston Churchill. What Shaw actually believed was that we must rely on sexual attraction to guide us, and that the procreation of children should not be confined within classes or religions or races. In other words he believed in the benefits of mixed marriages. But we feel the need to demonise him, as a previous generation felt the need to criminalise Oscar Wilde. It is not that he didn't say stupid or insensitive things. He knew this as well as anyone, but believed in the right of the intellectual to test any idea to destruction and pleaded with critics not to judge him by what he called his \"imbecilities\". </p> <p>But some academic authors cannot resist imbecilities. Like blind pedestrians, they follow, as if believing that Shaw himself was guilty of the same deeds as Hitler and Stalin, or that these dictators were acting on his orders. In fact, Shaw made clear that it would have been better for the world if such people had never existed. But it was foolish, he added, to believe that history had not been dominated by them or that \"we were somehow living beyond history now in a land ruled by our private moralities\". What Shaw wrote about Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany was part of his tactical foreign policy, a political treatment for national paranoia and aggressive inferiority. But his language was darkened by the awful metaphors of his imagination. </p> <p>That imagination was undoubtedly affected by those first 20 years of neglect and unhappiness in Dublin, and the next 20 years of failure and poverty in London over all of which he appeared to rise on the wings of comedy. His prefaces are sometimes comparable to the horrific satires of Jonathan Swift and, fuelled by the same disgust with human beings, the concentrated pessimism of Samuel Beckett. </p> <p>It has been Shaw's fate to be assailed by literal-minded academics, championed by humourless scholars and presented on stage by timid matinee directors. But there are at last signs of a change. Writing of Heartbreak House in 1997, Susannah Clapp wrote in the Observer: \"The main strength of David Hare's production is an unexpected one: it transmits what Shaw is always accused of lacking - force of feeling.\" The following year, reviewing The Doctor's Dilemma at the Almeida, Michael Billington wrote: \"We have, I suspect , done Shaw a grave injustice. We have always treated him as a cerebral comedian or didactic dramatist. But... Shaw was a passionate writer obsessed by the power of romance over realism.\" If we can follow that romance and discard the didacticism we will have recovered a major dramatist for this new century. </p>",

      "bodyText": "This year Bernard Shaw is 144. It is of course, no age at all for the author of Back to Methuselah. That cycle of plays, searching like a Hubble telescope for some distant gleam of optimism, reaches forward to the year 31920, when human beings regularly live for several hundred years. But if GBS (he hated the name George and never used it) is nowhere near that Shavian prime yet, he is nevertheless in his element as the most unfashionable playwright and political thinker of today. For he was, like Ibsen, a sort of devil's advocate who, in the words of William Archer, Ibsen's English translator and Shaw's friend, \"goes about picking holes in every 'well-known fact'\". He will not allow complacency; he hates secondhand opinions; he attacks fashion; he continually challenges and unsettles, questioning and provoking us even when he is making us laugh. And he is still at it. No clich\u00e9 or truism of contemporary life is entirely safe from him. Shaw began this work soon after arriving in England at 20 - in the words of the Irish poet AE, \"as the last saint sent out from Ireland to save the world\". Apparently rising above his first 20 years of unhappiness and neglect in Dublin, and soldiering through the next 20 years of failure as a novelist and playwright in London, he set himself up in the last quarter of the 19th century as a professional man of genius. \"England had conquered Ireland,\" he explained, \"so there was nothing for it but to come over and conquer England.\" By the time Shaw and his wife Charlotte came to live in the Hert fordshire village of Ayot St Lawrence in 1906, GBS was 50 and gained a good deal of notoriety as an experimental dramatist and political pamphleteer. Whatever his subject, he advocated change. His arrival at the rectory was like the landing of a meteor. What on earth did this hitherto undisturbed agricultural community make of him? Those who had the vote were, in the main, Tory voters and they did not hold much with going to frivolous places like theatres. So they would have known GBS during those years before the first world war mainly through the newspapers. In his charming play, Village Wooing, partly inspired by Ayot St Lawrence, Shaw wrote: \"You must always let yourself think about everything. And you must think about everything as it is, not as it is talked about... We should never accept anything reverently without asking it a great many very searching questions.\" But this is what the villagers objected to. Surely there were some things best left alone, some things that did not bear thinking of, and a whole lot of things that, even in a democracy, you could never affect. The trouble about GBS was that he turned up every stone until there was no place on which you could safely place your foot. Think of everything in this searching and critical way and you would go mad.And certainly there were some people who thought GBS was mad. His views on education, for example, like his views on punishment - on all discipline apparently short of capital punishment itself, which he seemed to advocate as a sort of merciful euthanasia - would surely lead to chaos and anarchy if they were ever put into practice. He thought England's public schools for rich private people so socially divisive that he would like to see them all razed to the ground and the ground itself sown with salt. He thought the arts more important than the teaching of Latin, a thoroughly dead language that could surely be advocated only by those with a \"vested interest in torture\". Children, he concluded, \"should be compelled to do without adult guidance, and depend on themselves to the full limit of their resourcefulness\". England's out-of-date education system had led to a fossilised social system. Shaw was eager to upset our vacuum-packed categories of class and gender. As an active supporter of feminism, he attacked HH Asquith, the Liberal prime minister, for opposing the franchise for women. \"This is a very common opinion,\" Shaw wrote in a letter to the Times, \"that woman is not the female of the human species, but a distinct and inferior species, naturally disqualified from voting as a rabbit is disqualified from voting\". His tactics were to make this opinion politically disadvantageous. For how could you vote for the Liberal party and look any woman in the face again? Over forcible feeding of the suffragettes, Shaw was at his most savagely ironic and assertive. He argued that forcible feeding was illegal and a denial of a human being's fundamental rights. Herbert Gladstone, secretary of state for home affairs, gave him the opportunity of a gloriously Shavian rejoinder when Gladstone claimed that this intake of nourishment was not unpleasant. In a letter to the Times Shaw invited Gladstone to dinner. The Fabian Society, he promised, would give him a banquet. \"The rarest wines and delicacies shall be provided absolutely regardless of expense,\" he wrote. \"The only condition we shall make is that Mr Herbert Gladstone shall partake through the nose; and that a cinematograph machine be at work at the time registering for the public satisfaction the waterings of his mouth, the smackings of his lips, and other unmistakable symptoms of luxurious delight.\" The difficulty ordinary readers experienced with GBS was that they could seldom tell whether or not he was serious. And the difficulty Shaw had with the general reader, the reader from Ayot St Lawrence as it were, was that the more readable and entertaining he became the less seriously he was taken. This was a very English gambit: to give credence to nothing you enjoyed reading and to read nothing you didn't enjoy. In an article in the Clarion in the summer of 1907, The Gentle Art Of Unpleasantness, Shaw laid out the basis of his socialist programme. \"Everybody knows,\" he reminded readers, \"that the rich live by robbing the poor. That is why no gentleman every mentions it.\" But Shaw was not a gentleman. He believed that no tolerable social life was possible without the acceptance of equality as the condition of human association, and communism - which was public ownership of gas, water, banks, the lot - as the condition of human industry. Money should never be allowed to buy better health, longer life. When a country grew richer, there should be more money for all, not through some vague trickling-down process but through egalitarian distribution. He wanted to convert unequal private property into a literal commonwealth. That, quintessentially, was Shaw's socialist programme. And he was continually going round the country proclaiming it in public speeches. In May 1906, he spoke in Manchester. Among his audience was a young man later to become famous as a cricket correspondent and music critic, Neville Cardus. Shaw \"was not then regarded as that respectable,\" Cardus reminds us in his memoirs. \"As he stood on the platform, arms akimbo, in tweeds and still the red flame of socialism in his beard, he told us to burn down Manchester town hall and the cathedral. We revelled in the outrageousness of it, we had been repressed so long in our pubic discussions I was electrified by the tempo, charmed by the accent and twinkle, astonished that anybody could say so much without a manuscript, an hour of it and not a fumble . . .\" Shaw was perpetually ladling this frantic commotion into the national press which he regularly used as a platform from which to broadcast his ideas. He vigorously attacked vivisection, Shakespeare and charity (Can the Poor be Saved by the Pity of the Rich?). He championed photography and the value of swearing. He praised Jack the Ripper for drawing attention to social conditions in London's East End. He expounded the mysteries of \"socialism for millionaires\" - what would later be called \"champagne socialism\" - and he extolled the hygienic advantages of cremation over earth burial. \"The public does not acquire an inside knowledge of cemeteries until it dies and is buried,\" he explained. \"The objection to burial is not that people are occasionally buried alive; on the contrary buried people are quite unobjectionable whilst they survive. It is dead bodies that matter.\" He also attacked Christmas, representing himself as an admirer of Scrooge and the enemy of Santa Claus. The running battle between Shaw and Christmas lasted some 60 years, GBS having declared war on this \"orgy\" and \"nuisance\" in the 1880s. \"Christmas is best spent in some heathen country where the festival is unknown,\" he wrote. He urged people to forget it, and when asked by a newspaper how he liked to spend it, replied that he preferred not to spend it at all, since it was \"only something unpleasant that happens once a year. I am a lifelong advocate of its abolition.\" Looking back at the dramatic revolution that took place under Shaw and Granville Barker at the Royal Court theatre in Sloane Square between 1904 and 1907, it seems to have been an outstanding success, particularly among the young who went into the theatre as 19th-century aesthetes and came out 20th-century radicals. But the Court theatre was never a commercial success and Shaw himself was hardly recognised as a playwright by the critics. After he had written half a dozen plays, Max Beerbohm concluded that to produce even one of them \"would be almost impossible at any ordinary theatre\". And yet, in some perverse way, Shaw appeared to prosper. It was as if he got nourishment from all this invective and abuse. His first commercial success, a play we never hear of now called Fanny's First Play, uses many embattled themes from women's suffrage to police power and adds to the repertory of comic stage figures the idiotic theatre critic himself. The public loved it and it ran from 1911 to 1913 - that is, for more than 600 performances. The next year, following its premiere in Vienna, Pygmalion opened in London. It has remained the most popular of all his comedies: a genuinely pleasant play. So, to the confusion of his critics, Shaw in his 60s became the most famous and successful playwright in the world. For his film script of Pygmalion he won an Oscar; for his play Saint Joan, written five years after the war, he was awarded the Nobel prize for literature. But this was not the success Shaw wanted. He wanted influence, positive and subversive political influence, rather than a smothering of prizes. Indeed, his prize success coincided with the shrinking of his political influence. Before the war, he had been \"one of the leaders in the revolutionary movement of our youth\", Leonard Woolf wrote in his autobiography. By the mid-30s, Woolf was writing in the New Statesman \"There is no living man to whom the generations which came to maturity between 1900 and 1914 owed so much as to Mr Shaw... Nothing less than a world war could have prevented [him] from winning the minds of succeeding generations... ever since [the war] the barbarians have been on top.\" Who are these barbarians? Are they the theatre critics themselves? What they are claiming in their newspaper columns is that GBS is the barbarian. When Sam Walters staged The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles in the mid-1990s, the critics, realising that they were on unfamiliar territory, panicked. What were they to do?

Steel also notes, by the way, that Russia's October revolution took place in November, and - by implication - that the Act of Settlement 1701, which has taken such a drubbing in this newspaper recently, is really the Act of Settlement 1700. This is because in those days our year began on March 25, and the act became law in the bit of 1701 which belonged under that system to 1700. </p> <p> This has been a great week for small weeds: or to be more particular for the Arabidopsis thaliana, the mild uncelebrated weed which has given the world such a breakthrough in the understanding of plants. I hope that readers, in toasting the new millennium two weeks from now, will couple with it the name of this new benefactor of humankind; and that those who are pregnant in the year 2001 will consider giving their daughters the name Thaliana. Arabidopsis might just about do for their sons. </p> <p> And now, cricket. (Those readers who sometimes complain when I write about sport should look away now.) The failure of the Surrey leg spinner Ian Salisbury to make any impact in the test series just concluded against Pakistan came as no surprise to Smallweed. As I have noted before, it is almost always a mistake for selectors to pick players named after cathedral cities. </p> <p>The one exception was Arthur Shrewsbury, who played 23 tests for England in the closing years of the last (ie 19th) century. Asked to name the batsman he most admired among those he had played with (apart, of course, from himself), WG Grace is said to have responded: \"Give me Arthur\". </p> <p>But the Hon CJ Coventry (Worcestershire) lasted only two tests - against South Africa in 1882 - while AP Wells (Sussex) played only one. One would like to believe that those at the Oval would never forget what happened to Wells in 1995, when at 33, with 15 summers of country cricket behind him, he was at last given a chance to bat for his country, only to be caught off his very first ball. But in fact great swaths of the crowd were far too busy chomping and slurping to take any notice. There was no England second innings and Wells was not picked again. </p> <p> I'm sure I am not alone in finding William Hague's assault on the Macpherson report curiously incomplete. Why does he fail to mention, as evidence of the depression of police morale, the fate in the past two seasons of the Metropolitan police rugby XV? In 1999-2000, their first full season after Macpherson pronounced, they lost every one of their 26 games in division 4 south, scoring only 223 points while conceding 1,308 (an average of 50 per match) and were relegated. \"They struggled on some days to field a decent side,\" the official RFU directory observes with just a touch of the otiose. And even now that they are down in London division one they continue to struggle. They have lost every one of their 11 games so far this season, scoring 82 points and conceding 355. As the ancients used so wisely to say: \"Post hoc propter hoc.\" </p> <p> A writer to the Times says he is baffled by the domination of contralto solos in oratorio by counter-tenors. In concerts and recordings of all kinds, he says, the contralto voice is being replaced by the peculiar sound of males singing falsetto. \"Have contralto singers,\" he asks, \"been sent into exile?\" </p> <p> <strong>An old musicologist writes: </strong> These words strike a chill in the hearts of old musicologists such as myself, recalling as they do the dreadful events of the year 1927, when one by one basset horn players went missing from most of our principal orchestras. The rest of a band would turn up for a concert to find the desk assigned to the basset horn empty, and subsequent calls to his home would reveal that the player had disappeared. </p> <p>Only strenuous representations by the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin - no mean performer himself, by the way, upon the bassoon - pleading the need to avert a panic, kept this scandal out of the press. The crisis grew worse when amateur orchestras in places as far apart as Blackburn and Lostwithiel, normally equipped with such players, began to report them missing. </p> <p>Fortunately, a Scotland Yard detective, whiling away an evening in Bavaria eavesdropping on the gossip in a local bierkeller, picked up a conversation which led the force to resolve the mystery. After months of assiduous probing by detectives in lederhosen, the missing musicians were traced to the dungeon of a high-steepled castle on the shining, sinuous road between Rosenheim and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, from which, sobbing and shaking but tootling bravely away on their precious instruments, they were brought back to liberty. </p> <p>A rich and eccentric count called von Schnauffenhausen had, it transpired, composed a concerto for 83 basset horns which no orchestra in the region could play. He had therefore resorted to kidnapping potential soloists, both from Britain and from countries such as Liechtenstein and Andorra, where, as he supposed, their absence would hardly be noticed. Could it be that a similar fiendish plot has now been laid to seize and incarcerate British contraltos? </p> <p><strong> A pedant writes: </strong> I mistrust this story. It does not appear in Grove. </p> <p> <strong>An old musicologist wearily comments: </strong> That is the trouble with Grove. \"Insufficiently eclectic\" is the term I think I would use.</p>",

Asked to name the batsman he most admired among those he had played with (apart, of course, from himself), WG Grace is said to have responded: \"Give me Arthur\". But the Hon CJ Coventry (Worcestershire) lasted only two tests - against South Africa in 1882 - while AP Wells (Sussex) played only one. One would like to believe that those at the Oval would never forget what happened to Wells in 1995, when at 33, with 15 summers of country cricket behind him, he was at last given a chance to bat for his country, only to be caught off his very first ball. But in fact great swaths of the crowd were far too busy chomping and slurping to take any notice. There was no England second innings and Wells was not picked again. I'm sure I am not alone in finding William Hague's assault on the Macpherson report curiously incomplete. Why does he fail to mention, as evidence of the depression of police morale, the fate in the past two seasons of the Metropolitan police rugby XV? In 1999-2000, their first full season after Macpherson pronounced, they lost every one of their 26 games in division 4 south, scoring only 223 points while conceding 1,308 (an average of 50 per match) and were relegated. \"They struggled on some days to field a decent side,\" the official RFU directory observes with just a touch of the otiose. And even now that they are down in London division one they continue to struggle. They have lost every one of their 11 games so far this season, scoring 82 points and conceding 355. As the ancients used so wisely to say: \"Post hoc propter hoc.\" A writer to the Times says he is baffled by the domination of contralto solos in oratorio by counter-tenors. In concerts and recordings of all kinds, he says, the contralto voice is being replaced by the peculiar sound of males singing falsetto. \"Have contralto singers,\" he asks, \"been sent into exile?\" An old musicologist writes: These words strike a chill in the hearts of old musicologists such as myself, recalling as they do the dreadful events of the year 1927, when one by one basset horn players went missing from most of our principal orchestras. The rest of a band would turn up for a concert to find the desk assigned to the basset horn empty, and subsequent calls to his home would reveal that the player had disappeared. Only strenuous representations by the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin - no mean performer himself, by the way, upon the bassoon - pleading the need to avert a panic, kept this scandal out of the press. The crisis grew worse when amateur orchestras in places as far apart as Blackburn and Lostwithiel, normally equipped with such players, began to report them missing. Fortunately, a Scotland Yard detective, whiling away an evening in Bavaria eavesdropping on the gossip in a local bierkeller, picked up a conversation which led the force to resolve the mystery. After months of assiduous probing by detectives in lederhosen, the missing musicians were traced to the dungeon of a high-steepled castle on the shining, sinuous road between Rosenheim and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, from which, sobbing and shaking but tootling bravely away on their precious instruments, they were brought back to liberty. A rich and eccentric count called von Schnauffenhausen had, it transpired, composed a concerto for 83 basset horns which no orchestra in the region could play. He had therefore resorted to kidnapping potential soloists, both from Britain and from countries such as Liechtenstein and Andorra, where, as he supposed, their absence would hardly be noticed. Could it be that a similar fiendish plot has now been laid to seize and incarcerate British contraltos? A pedant writes: I mistrust this story. It does not appear in Grove. An old musicologist wearily comments: That is the trouble with Grove. \"Insufficiently eclectic\" is the term I think I would use.",

Yesterday Airbus chief executive No\u00ebl Forgeard dropped a strong hint which way he expected a decision to go: \"With 50 orders and many more options from quality customers around the world, Airbus is now in a strong position to launch production of the A3XX.\" Virgin chairman Sir Richard Branson said the new aircraft would allow his airline to continue growing despite slot limitations at Heathrow. \"As other carriers are shrinking in size and cutting their network, Virgin Atlantic will be offering passengers more seats on more services to more destinations,\" he said. The extra space provided by the A3XX - it has 49% more floor space and 35% more seats than the largest competitor flying today - would be used to provide facilities such as shops, gyms, business centres, beauty parlours and playrooms for children. Sir Richard said that double beds would be installed for business class passengers. \"You can do it on cruise ships, you can do it at home, so why shouldn't you be able to have relationships on planes?\" he was quoted as saying yesterday. Go-ahead for the A3XX would provide a boost for Britain's aircraft industry. Airbus is owned by a combination of the Franco-German-Spanish concern EADS and British Aerospace, with the UK company making the wings for previous Airbus aircraft.

In time, Mr Mugabe would cancel the 2002 presidential election because he was almost certain to lose.</p> <p>\"We decided to make a tactical withdrawal when we realised he in fact wanted that protest to go ahead,\" said Tendai Biti, the opposition's chief legal strategist. \"There was going to be bloodshed, really going to be bloodshed. We realised that the state saw this intended protest not as a democratic right, the state saw this as war.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The majority opinion in the party was, no, we can't do this, we'll be playing into the hands of a madman, because once 10 or so people are killed, he declares a state of emergency, bans all civic organisations, he dissolves parliament and the law then allows him to rule alone for a year.\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai said the party would now concentrate on winning the election in 2002 but with Mr Mugabe so unpopular, and the economy facing further collapse, some in the MDC doubt the president will ever permit such a vote.</p> <p>They argue that he has clearly demonstrated his contempt for the rule of law by defying court orders, barring legal action to contest June's parliamentary results and granting amnesty to people who murdered more than 30 of his political opponents.</p> <p>Even if there is an election, the MDC is facing a new challenge. The party has lost the important backing of the country's main trade union confederation, which Mr Tsvangirai used to head and which was an important springboard for launching the opposition into parliament in June.</p> <p>Zanu-PF has tried to regain control of the confederation, but the unions are also being wooed by a prominent ruling party dissident and former cabinet minister, Eddison Zvobgo. Although Mr Zvobgo remains a member of Zanu-PF, he has been sounding out other dissidents about the creation of a third party to challenge Mr Mugabe and the existing opposition.</p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai admits that popular pressure is growing for his party to retake the initiative and launch its strikes and street protests against Mr Mugabe.</p> <p>Mr Biti says the MDC is walking a tightrope. \"If we fall too behind the people we become irrelevant, we become history. At the same time if we pull too far forward we expose the people we are trying to lead. That is the bare issue here - maintaining a balance between a vampire state and expectations of an increasingly radicalised population.\"</p>",

Yesterday, a special congress of the ruling Zanu-PF reaffirmed support for its leader after he declared that the party was at war with Zimbabwe's whites and their political \"accomplices\", the MDC. Six weeks ago, the MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, said the opposition was planning a series of strikes and demonstrations that would topple Mr Mugabe within months. Mr Tsvangirai derided Zimbabwe's president as the \"Milosevic of Africa\" and said he should go immediately because had \"committed genocide against a minority, rigged elections, ignored the rule of law and created a state which is internationally isolated\". But not unsympathetic senior officials in the Central Intelligence Organisation, the government's principal security organ, warned MDC leaders that they were playing into Mr Mugabe's hands. They said the president intended to meet popular protests with force, and that violence would then be used as an excuse to detain opposition leaders, shut down parliament and impose a state of emergency. In time, Mr Mugabe would cancel the 2002 presidential election because he was almost certain to lose. \"We decided to make a tactical withdrawal when we realised he in fact wanted that protest to go ahead,\" said Tendai Biti, the opposition's chief legal strategist. \"There was going to be bloodshed, really going to be bloodshed. We realised that the state saw this intended protest not as a democratic right, the state saw this as war.\" He added: \"The majority opinion in the party was, no, we can't do this, we'll be playing into the hands of a madman, because once 10 or so people are killed, he declares a state of emergency, bans all civic organisations, he dissolves parliament and the law then allows him to rule alone for a year.\" he said. Mr Tsvangirai said the party would now concentrate on winning the election in 2002 but with Mr Mugabe so unpopular, and the economy facing further collapse, some in the MDC doubt the president will ever permit such a vote. They argue that he has clearly demonstrated his contempt for the rule of law by defying court orders, barring legal action to contest June's parliamentary results and granting amnesty to people who murdered more than 30 of his political opponents. Even if there is an election, the MDC is facing a new challenge. The party has lost the important backing of the country's main trade union confederation, which Mr Tsvangirai used to head and which was an important springboard for launching the opposition into parliament in June. Zanu-PF has tried to regain control of the confederation, but the unions are also being wooed by a prominent ruling party dissident and former cabinet minister, Eddison Zvobgo. Although Mr Zvobgo remains a member of Zanu-PF, he has been sounding out other dissidents about the creation of a third party to challenge Mr Mugabe and the existing opposition. Mr Tsvangirai admits that popular pressure is growing for his party to retake the initiative and launch its strikes and street protests against Mr Mugabe. Mr Biti says the MDC is walking a tightrope. \"If we fall too behind the people we become irrelevant, we become history. At the same time if we pull too far forward we expose the people we are trying to lead. That is the bare issue here - maintaining a balance between a vampire state and expectations of an increasingly radicalised population.\"",

      "body": "<p>On one side of the Channel, order and liberty, peace and prosperity; on the other, the barking dogs of ideology and reaction, upheaval and revolution. But for us, beneficent evolution, wisdom slowly maturing in the sunny landscape of an ancestral constitution, and the glories of the common law. Feed on these precedents and be grateful. Shudder at the juxtaposed reality just 20 miles away.</p> <p>\"Scepticism\" about Europe is now firmly wrapped in the shroud of contemporary Toryism. But for most of English history it is liberalism which has opposed the European political tradition, and the wildness of its mood swings between left and right, between commissars and kings, Jacobins and priests.</p> <p>The story is a familiar one, told by England, mother of parliaments, to the subject-children at her knee. Over there, power was centralised, and in two stages. First, the despotism, sometimes enlightened, of monarchs. Theirs was a true modernity of efficient bureaucracy impatient of ancient aristocratic rights. Its monument is Versailles. Second came the despots' heirs - the totalitarians scornful of individual democratic rights. And their mausoleum is the Kremlin.</p> <p>But England is meant to be incorrigibly exceptional. Limits on monarchy combine with property rights to protect us against arbitrary rule. Parliamentary representation gradually extends down the social scale. Beneath it all, a constitution not so much unwritten as written at different times and found in different places - yet somehow all hanging together.</p> <p>All countries need their founding myths - and there is enough truth or truism in this story to explain its appeal. Much of English history has been written by English liberals and Whigs in order to demonstrate its truth. Europe's collapse in a prolonged civil war from 1914 to 1945 arrived on cue as if to confirm the happiness of the island condition. But distance is needed now to lend any enchantment to this constitutional view. Closer inspection dissolves the visionary fabric</p> <p>Monarchy is central to the tale. Oceans of ink have been drained in the Whig-liberal celebration of 1688-89's gloriously smooth revolution and its 1701 post-script, the Act of Settlement. Recovery from the Stuart disaster seemed complete. Both Charles I and II had been genuinely Europhile monarchs. They pined for continental methods of absolute, non-parliamentary rule - the smartest and most dynamic model of government available in the 17th century. The first Charles tried to introduce it with armies; the second attempted it by secret treaties with Louis XIV. But Whiggery triumphant sealed the experiment's fate.</p> <p>That year of 1701 was also when Louis recognised the Stuart James III, the Old Pretender, as lawful king of England. That now seems like a silly spit in the face of history. But the Act of Settlement, like much of our constitutional history, was a panicky measure, a quick fix which only retrospectively came to embody a deliberative wisdom.</p> <p>The defence of the Hanoverian settlement is that it saved Britain from the continental nonsense of the confessional state - that reactionary alliance between throne and altar. And yet, the Act of Settlement merely provided the Anglican version of the same obscurantism. The Church of England was as firm-wristed a sprinkler of holy oils on monarchic heads as the Church of Rome. When the confessional state retreated in 19th-century Europe, the English followed suit. Eurosceptics -whether in 1701 or 2000 - bent on turning the Channel into an ocean, always miss the common currents.</p> <p>Monarchy's other key 18th-century date is 1789 - the event which made the modern European state possible. English liberalism celebrates it as the date which the English avoided: no year of terror, no tumbrils, no guillotines in Whitehall. For this we should again incline our heads to the Hanoverian wisdom of moderation.</p> <p>But this is the sleep of constitutional reason which brings forth myths. The paradox of English liberty is that it's not very good on freedom. The England ushered in by 1701 was a thoroughly ancien-regime affair.

      "bodyText": "On one side of the Channel, order and liberty, peace and prosperity; on the other, the barking dogs of ideology and reaction, upheaval and revolution. But for us, beneficent evolution, wisdom slowly maturing in the sunny landscape of an ancestral constitution, and the glories of the common law. Feed on these precedents and be grateful. Shudder at the juxtaposed reality just 20 miles away. \"Scepticism\" about Europe is now firmly wrapped in the shroud of contemporary Toryism. But for most of English history it is liberalism which has opposed the European political tradition, and the wildness of its mood swings between left and right, between commissars and kings, Jacobins and priests. The story is a familiar one, told by England, mother of parliaments, to the subject-children at her knee. Over there, power was centralised, and in two stages. First, the despotism, sometimes enlightened, of monarchs. Theirs was a true modernity of efficient bureaucracy impatient of ancient aristocratic rights. Its monument is Versailles. Second came the despots' heirs - the totalitarians scornful of individual democratic rights. And their mausoleum is the Kremlin. But England is meant to be incorrigibly exceptional. Limits on monarchy combine with property rights to protect us against arbitrary rule. Parliamentary representation gradually extends down the social scale. Beneath it all, a constitution not so much unwritten as written at different times and found in different places - yet somehow all hanging together. All countries need their founding myths - and there is enough truth or truism in this story to explain its appeal. Much of English history has been written by English liberals and Whigs in order to demonstrate its truth. Europe's collapse in a prolonged civil war from 1914 to 1945 arrived on cue as if to confirm the happiness of the island condition. But distance is needed now to lend any enchantment to this constitutional view. Closer inspection dissolves the visionary fabric Monarchy is central to the tale. Oceans of ink have been drained in the Whig-liberal celebration of 1688-89's gloriously smooth revolution and its 1701 post-script, the Act of Settlement. Recovery from the Stuart disaster seemed complete. Both Charles I and II had been genuinely Europhile monarchs. They pined for continental methods of absolute, non-parliamentary rule - the smartest and most dynamic model of government available in the 17th century. The first Charles tried to introduce it with armies; the second attempted it by secret treaties with Louis XIV. But Whiggery triumphant sealed the experiment's fate. That year of 1701 was also when Louis recognised the Stuart James III, the Old Pretender, as lawful king of England. That now seems like a silly spit in the face of history. But the Act of Settlement, like much of our constitutional history, was a panicky measure, a quick fix which only retrospectively came to embody a deliberative wisdom. The defence of the Hanoverian settlement is that it saved Britain from the continental nonsense of the confessional state - that reactionary alliance between throne and altar. And yet, the Act of Settlement merely provided the Anglican version of the same obscurantism. The Church of England was as firm-wristed a sprinkler of holy oils on monarchic heads as the Church of Rome. When the confessional state retreated in 19th-century Europe, the English followed suit. Eurosceptics -whether in 1701 or 2000 - bent on turning the Channel into an ocean, always miss the common currents. Monarchy's other key 18th-century date is 1789 - the event which made the modern European state possible. English liberalism celebrates it as the date which the English avoided: no year of terror, no tumbrils, no guillotines in Whitehall. For this we should again incline our heads to the Hanoverian wisdom of moderation. But this is the sleep of constitutional reason which brings forth myths. The paradox of English liberty is that it's not very good on freedom. The England ushered in by 1701 was a thoroughly ancien-regime affair. Certainly, it was hostile to despotic kings but it was in no sense proto-democratic. It was, on the contrary, tender towards the liberties of aristocratic groups - especially oligarchic Whig ones. Tories who opposed English involvement in continental European wars were the losers. But big gun Whigs like Marlborough (the original subject of For He's a Jolly Good Fellow after his Malplaquet victory of 1709) made fortunes out of killing European Catholics. England today remains an ancien-regime society because it had no 1789 experience: 1701 worked all too well, helped by the zeal of generals such as the Duke of Cumberland, who shared with Marlborough the epithet of \"butcher\" after his work at Culloden. Sanctified by time's passage and Anglicanism's power, England ossified as a network of associations, of clubs and regiments, of schools and colleges, of JPs, high sheriffs and lord lieutenants, of Jane Austen-ish county society. It remains a place where loyalties are local and particular and are owed to the dynastic power which originally underwrote these loyalties. The state, that progressivist dissolver of prejudice, has had no English home. But continental Europeans have been forced by 1789 and the collapse of dynasticism to turn themselves into citizens. Which is why their states work in a way that our congenitally tatty series of governments do not - and cannot, for as long as we remain a monarchy. Though very old in one sense, in another England remains a barely adolescent country - one which is only just beginning to question its own identity and probe its existence.

It is in this sense that monarchy in England makes idiots as well as children of us all. For it proposes bogus models of community invented from above rather than ones of our own devising: princes, for example, mopping up loos and downing pints. Monarchy has stopped the English from inventing themselves as a nation. Not for nothing did more sophisticated societies than ours, those of early Rome and ancient Athens, regard monarchy as a primitive stage in humanity's progress. For our arrested development we have to thank the sorry new world ushered in by 1701 and all that. Britain's abiding European condition now propels it forward to catch up with 1789 over 200 years later than our neighbours. We are moving from being an early 18th-century European country into an early 21st-century European state.

As the prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, insisted he could not compromise on the EU force, Nato ministers meeting in Brussels were unable to crack stiff Turkish resistance. Despite an appeal from President Bill Clinton, Mr Ecevit said he would not give fledgling EU defence bodies automatic access to the resources of the 19-member alliance - which operates by consensus - without being given a full role in decision-making. Turkey - which has a prickly relationship with the EU and little chance of joining for years - fears that if it has no decisive say, such resources could be used against its interests, possibly in disputes with Greece over the Aegean or Cyprus. \"We are standing firm on our position because we may face serious dangers if we are excluded from the European Defence and Security Identity,\" Mr Ecevit insisted. \"We feel obliged to pursue our position without compromise.\" Talks ended after Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, led feverish efforts by alliance foreign ministers to find a way out of the impasse. Turkey's foreign minister, Ismail Cem, was offered what Nato diplomats described as \"special guarantees\". The crisis threatens to delay controversial plans for a deal which would give the EU \"assured access\" to Nato planning resources for missions that the alliance chooses not to undertake. Diplomats said the guarantee of access was the \"keystone\" of the agreement. Some sources believe Turkey is holding out for a better deal from the new administration of George W Bush. In a separate development, Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel leader sentenced to hang by Turkey, was yesterday granted leave to appeal by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In a case with profound implications for Turkey's relations with the EU, Ocalan can now challenge the death sentence passed last year. Ocalan's complaints arose from the death penalty itself, allegations of ill treatment and violations of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Turkey is a signatory. Ocalan, the founder of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party or PKK, was kidnapped by secret agents in Kenya in 1998. At a trial in Turkey he was condemned to hang for hundreds of killings in the PKK's 16-year war. A ruling from the Strasbourg court - which is not connected to the EU - could take several months. \"This is a very positive development,\" Ocalan's lawyer Irfan Dundar said in Istanbul. \"They have accepted all the points where we believe there was a violation of rights.\" Mark Muller, chairman of the Kurdish Human Rights Project, said it was \"the most significant case on the death penalty\" ever to come before the court.

The net result yesterday was to leave shareholders twitchy ahead of the group's full-year figures, due at the end of February. There was a vague suspicion that the numbers were just not looking good enough for the management to go out on the road selling APBiotech. In March, when investors were steaming into companies such as Nycomed, excited that genomic research might discover the key to life, the shares hit a peak of 745p. They have been drifting lower ever since and yesterday's trading statement presented an irresistible opportunity to slice another 30p off the price to 525.5p. Nycomed is an exciting, professionally run company, promising us everything from diagnostic tests for Parkinson's disease to new ways of screening lungs. The shares are only likely to travel sideways over the next couple of months. Hold.",

Back at the Mirror, the task of portraying Jane fell to Pett's assistant, Michael Hubbard, who kept her postwar antics as saucy as ever, while giving the strip the more realistic look demanded in the era of classic girl-adventurer strips in the 1950s. In the face of the competition, Jane was eventually married off to her longtime boyfriend, Georgie Porgie, and the two sailed off into the sunset in October 1959.</p> <p>All her life, Leighton-Porter continued to be identified with the character she had helped create. In 1949, she had starred in The Adventures Of Jane, a 55-minute black and white movie, in which a phoney, gem-smuggling sea captain had used her as an unwitting carrier for stolen diamonds.

      "body": "<p>These days, you can't even burn down a mosque without someone saying you're racist. You can't put on a pointy white hood, set fire to a cross and hold a rally for the Aryan master race without the liberal elite suddenly deciding that this would somehow be \"politically incorrect\". Try and kidnap young black people from West Africa and sell them as slaves to plantation owners in the deep South, and suddenly you'll find yourself being accused of \"racial discrimination\" by the PC police of Tony Blair's nanny state.</p> <p>This was the essence of William Hague's speech on the Macpherson report. That yer anti-racism is all very well, but things have gone too far the other way. I'm sure I've seen that bald-headed bigot mouthing off about the blacks somewhere before? Of course, William Hague has turned into Alf Garnett. He sits in his armchair under portraits of the Queen and Churchill, ranting and raving and getting all his facts wrong. \"Yer crime is going up, right?\"</p> <p>\"No, it's going down.\"</p> <p>\"Shut up Ffion, you silly moo! Yer crime is going up because yer police numbers is falling under Labour.\"</p> <p>\"But police numbers have been falling since 1993.\"</p> <p>\"Exactly, cos yer bloody Macpherson says every one of 'em is racist.\"</p> <p>\"But the report was only last year and it never said that anyway.\"</p> <p>\"Look - shut up! And stop making out I'm racialist, you silly Welsh cow!\"</p> <p>What Hague was doing in his speech this week was shooting the messenger. What's more, Sir William Macpherson was an unarmed messenger, shot without provocation or warning and no doubt Hague will be cleared of all blame when they hold an internal inquiry. Macpherson had only confirmed what we all knew anyway, that racism was rife in the police force and that the constant harassment of black people was counter-productive to the fight against crime.</p> <p>After an IRA bomb destroyed the Baltic Exchange in the City of London, a \"ring of steel\" was placed around the City, and armed police were stationed at checkpoints where they stopped any car suspected of containing Irish terrorists. I had never realised that there were so many black people in the IRA. Every week I would drive over Blackfriars Bridge and see armed police searching the car of yet another black man thought to be a dangerous Irish republican. \"Here comes another Rasta, sarge! He looks like he's come straight from South Armagh with a car-load of Semtex.\"</p> <p>But recently progress had started to be made. The police accepted the findings of the Macpherson report and the number of unnecessary \"stop and searches\" of black youths had dropped dramatically. The fragile, painstaking process of rebuilding bridges between the police and the black community was just beginning. Cue William Hague with his size 10 Dr Marten boots.</p> <p>For the sake of perceived narrow party advantage between now and election day, he is prepared to stir up racism with a poisonous speech packed with prejudice, factual inaccuracies and straight forward lies. No wonder the father of Stephen Lawrence is so disgusted. The racists who regularly attack Britain's racial minorities need only the slightest encouragement to justify their actions. If the would-be prime minister says that blacks are getting away with crimes because the police aren't allowed to stop them, then young racists will interpret this as a call for them to step in to take action themselves. Hague must know this, but obviously doesn't care.</p> <p>The time has come for Sir William Macpherson to do another report - this time to uncover the institutional racism inside the Conservative party. If Nelson Mandela had turned up at the Tory conference they would have asked if anyone ordered a minicab. The party that suggests it should govern multi-ethnic Britain does not have a single black or Asian MP. First we had Liam Fox stirring up racism by sounding off about Indian doctors who don't speak English properly, and now Hague is trying to equate crime and black people in the run-up to the election.</p> <p>Typical - you get one racist move into the Conservative party and then another racist moves in next door and before you know it the whole party's full of them. I've nothing against Conservatives myself - they're good at sport and all that, Seb Coe and Colin Moynihan did us proud at the Olympics, but you have to admit that when it comes to crime; well, all I'll say is that without the likes of Jeffrey Archer and Jonathan Aitken the police wouldn't be under all this pressure in the first place.</p> <p>Inciting racial hatred is against the law in this country but, of course, you're not allowed to arrest them for it, oh no, that would be politically incorrect. The Conservative establishment have made it impossible for the police to do anything about it. Real equality will only have arrived when the police stop and search William Hague for possession of an offensive speech every time he walks down the road.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;comment@theguardian.com&quot;\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "These days, you can't even burn down a mosque without someone saying you're racist. You can't put on a pointy white hood, set fire to a cross and hold a rally for the Aryan master race without the liberal elite suddenly deciding that this would somehow be \"politically incorrect\". Try and kidnap young black people from West Africa and sell them as slaves to plantation owners in the deep South, and suddenly you'll find yourself being accused of \"racial discrimination\" by the PC police of Tony Blair's nanny state. This was the essence of William Hague's speech on the Macpherson report. That yer anti-racism is all very well, but things have gone too far the other way. I'm sure I've seen that bald-headed bigot mouthing off about the blacks somewhere before? Of course, William Hague has turned into Alf Garnett. He sits in his armchair under portraits of the Queen and Churchill, ranting and raving and getting all his facts wrong. \"Yer crime is going up, right?\" \"No, it's going down.\" \"Shut up Ffion, you silly moo! Yer crime is going up because yer police numbers is falling under Labour.\" \"But police numbers have been falling since 1993.\" \"Exactly, cos yer bloody Macpherson says every one of 'em is racist.\" \"But the report was only last year and it never said that anyway.\" \"Look - shut up! And stop making out I'm racialist, you silly Welsh cow!\" What Hague was doing in his speech this week was shooting the messenger. What's more, Sir William Macpherson was an unarmed messenger, shot without provocation or warning and no doubt Hague will be cleared of all blame when they hold an internal inquiry. Macpherson had only confirmed what we all knew anyway, that racism was rife in the police force and that the constant harassment of black people was counter-productive to the fight against crime. After an IRA bomb destroyed the Baltic Exchange in the City of London, a \"ring of steel\" was placed around the City, and armed police were stationed at checkpoints where they stopped any car suspected of containing Irish terrorists. I had never realised that there were so many black people in the IRA. Every week I would drive over Blackfriars Bridge and see armed police searching the car of yet another black man thought to be a dangerous Irish republican. \"Here comes another Rasta, sarge! He looks like he's come straight from South Armagh with a car-load of Semtex.\" But recently progress had started to be made. The police accepted the findings of the Macpherson report and the number of unnecessary \"stop and searches\" of black youths had dropped dramatically. The fragile, painstaking process of rebuilding bridges between the police and the black community was just beginning. Cue William Hague with his size 10 Dr Marten boots. For the sake of perceived narrow party advantage between now and election day, he is prepared to stir up racism with a poisonous speech packed with prejudice, factual inaccuracies and straight forward lies. No wonder the father of Stephen Lawrence is so disgusted. The racists who regularly attack Britain's racial minorities need only the slightest encouragement to justify their actions. If the would-be prime minister says that blacks are getting away with crimes because the police aren't allowed to stop them, then young racists will interpret this as a call for them to step in to take action themselves. Hague must know this, but obviously doesn't care. The time has come for Sir William Macpherson to do another report - this time to uncover the institutional racism inside the Conservative party. If Nelson Mandela had turned up at the Tory conference they would have asked if anyone ordered a minicab. The party that suggests it should govern multi-ethnic Britain does not have a single black or Asian MP. First we had Liam Fox stirring up racism by sounding off about Indian doctors who don't speak English properly, and now Hague is trying to equate crime and black people in the run-up to the election. Typical - you get one racist move into the Conservative party and then another racist moves in next door and before you know it the whole party's full of them. I've nothing against Conservatives myself - they're good at sport and all that, Seb Coe and Colin Moynihan did us proud at the Olympics, but you have to admit that when it comes to crime; well, all I'll say is that without the likes of Jeffrey Archer and Jonathan Aitken the police wouldn't be under all this pressure in the first place. Inciting racial hatred is against the law in this country but, of course, you're not allowed to arrest them for it, oh no, that would be politically incorrect. The Conservative establishment have made it impossible for the police to do anything about it. Real equality will only have arrived when the police stop and search William Hague for possession of an offensive speech every time he walks down the road. comment@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>Roy Ridgway, who was awarded the Albert Schweitzer gold medal for his humanitarian work and was part of a Nobel prizewinning peace team, has died aged 84. He was also the author of two groundbreaking books on prenatal and perinatal experiences, and the effects of nutrition on babies in the womb and, with his wife, set up a life-saving programme in Russia for children with cystic fibrosis.</p> <p>Ridgway was born in Wallasey and educated at Rock Ferry school on the Wirral. At 19, he founded and jointly edited the Wirral Magazine. As a conscientious objector during the second world war, he was imprisoned for three months. On release, he trained as a nurse before joining the Friends Ambulance Unit.</p> <p>After the war he returned to journalism and edited a range of magazines. From 1967-73, he edited New Doctor, a journal for GPs, before becoming a director of the Sparsholt Centre, near Winchester, one of the first places in Britain to teach humanistic psychotherapies.</p> <p>At Sparsholt, where he gained fresh insights into the effects of prenatal memory, Ridgway began work on The Unborn Child (1987). In 1979, he joined the British Medical Association secretariat and edited its publication, News Review. Two years later, he and others in the medical profession sympathetic to the anti-nuclear cause, founded the Medical Campaign Against Nuclear Weapons, and Ridgway became European public-relations director for International Physicians against Nuclear Warfare (IPNW).</p> <p>The group prepared two papers describing the scenario of an H-bomb on Boston, Massachusetts, and the effects of radiation fallout on children, and presented them to, among others, President Gorbachev. On the basis of this work, in 1985 Ridgway and four other IPNW members were awarded the Nobel peace prize.</p> <p>Having dealt with what he saw as \"the biggest negative to health\", Ridgway wanted to concentrate on the positive. He had gone back to freelance work in 1983, and, that year, had co-founded the combined British and Russian medical exchange programme, now HealthProm, in order to coordinate validated complementary medicine with conventional.</p> <p>His aim was always holistic; he was an ecologist, and felt that building community life, and a health programme using home-grown produce, was the best way to secure long-term health. In 1992, he founded the International Integregated Health Association (IIHA), and the 1990s also saw the publication of two further books, Preparing For Parenthood and Caring For Your Unborn Child. Both were based on his belief that many attributes and difficulties began to develop in the womb and that a mother's nutrition was crucial to a child's lifelong health.</p> <p>His wife Dorothea was indispensable to his work. They married just after the second world war and had three children. Their youngest, Tony, who was born in 1955, suffered cystic fibrosis, and Roy and Dorothea spent 29 years working to give him a happy and creative life.</p> <p>The first IIHA visit to Russia was in 1993. A year later, the Ridgways were in Moscow and took their experiences looking after Tony to the local hospital caring for some children with CF. Their work there mushroomed. Ridgway applied for grants and directed projects, including the Care of Children with Chronic Illnesses and their Families, funded by the European Commission.</p> <p>Roy was spiritual but not religious, though he was close to the Quakers. A warm-hearted family man, in recent years he figured, in woolly-white hair and beard, as a Santa Claus twinkling among Russian children, a director negotiating with a team of medical consultants, and a comedian merrily goose-stepping across Red Square.</p> <p>He is survived by Dorothea, a son and a daughter.</p> <p>Heber Roy Ridgway, journalist and peace campaigner, born May 2 1916; died November 5 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Roy Ridgway, who was awarded the Albert Schweitzer gold medal for his humanitarian work and was part of a Nobel prizewinning peace team, has died aged 84. He was also the author of two groundbreaking books on prenatal and perinatal experiences, and the effects of nutrition on babies in the womb and, with his wife, set up a life-saving programme in Russia for children with cystic fibrosis. Ridgway was born in Wallasey and educated at Rock Ferry school on the Wirral. At 19, he founded and jointly edited the Wirral Magazine. As a conscientious objector during the second world war, he was imprisoned for three months. On release, he trained as a nurse before joining the Friends Ambulance Unit. After the war he returned to journalism and edited a range of magazines. From 1967-73, he edited New Doctor, a journal for GPs, before becoming a director of the Sparsholt Centre, near Winchester, one of the first places in Britain to teach humanistic psychotherapies. At Sparsholt, where he gained fresh insights into the effects of prenatal memory, Ridgway began work on The Unborn Child (1987). In 1979, he joined the British Medical Association secretariat and edited its publication, News Review. Two years later, he and others in the medical profession sympathetic to the anti-nuclear cause, founded the Medical Campaign Against Nuclear Weapons, and Ridgway became European public-relations director for International Physicians against Nuclear Warfare (IPNW). The group prepared two papers describing the scenario of an H-bomb on Boston, Massachusetts, and the effects of radiation fallout on children, and presented them to, among others, President Gorbachev. On the basis of this work, in 1985 Ridgway and four other IPNW members were awarded the Nobel peace prize. Having dealt with what he saw as \"the biggest negative to health\", Ridgway wanted to concentrate on the positive. He had gone back to freelance work in 1983, and, that year, had co-founded the combined British and Russian medical exchange programme, now HealthProm, in order to coordinate validated complementary medicine with conventional. His aim was always holistic; he was an ecologist, and felt that building community life, and a health programme using home-grown produce, was the best way to secure long-term health. In 1992, he founded the International Integregated Health Association (IIHA), and the 1990s also saw the publication of two further books, Preparing For Parenthood and Caring For Your Unborn Child. Both were based on his belief that many attributes and difficulties began to develop in the womb and that a mother's nutrition was crucial to a child's lifelong health. His wife Dorothea was indispensable to his work. They married just after the second world war and had three children. Their youngest, Tony, who was born in 1955, suffered cystic fibrosis, and Roy and Dorothea spent 29 years working to give him a happy and creative life. The first IIHA visit to Russia was in 1993. A year later, the Ridgways were in Moscow and took their experiences looking after Tony to the local hospital caring for some children with CF. Their work there mushroomed. Ridgway applied for grants and directed projects, including the Care of Children with Chronic Illnesses and their Families, funded by the European Commission. Roy was spiritual but not religious, though he was close to the Quakers. A warm-hearted family man, in recent years he figured, in woolly-white hair and beard, as a Santa Claus twinkling among Russian children, a director negotiating with a team of medical consultants, and a comedian merrily goose-stepping across Red Square. He is survived by Dorothea, a son and a daughter. Heber Roy Ridgway, journalist and peace campaigner, born May 2 1916; died November 5 2000",

      "bodyText": "A man arrested this week for the murder of seven mentally handicapped young women more than 20 years ago could be released if French police find their bodies. Emile Louis, 66, a retired bus driver from Auxerre, 90 miles south-east of Paris, has confessed to killing the girls, all of whom lived with foster families and attended special day care centres. They disappeared without trace between 1977 and 1979. After one of the most bungled investigations in French judicial history, he was detained on Monday on a charge of kidnapping, a crime technically considered to be over once it is proved that the victim is no longer being held. But in a final absurdity, Mr Louis is very likely to be set free if the kidnapping charge reverts to one of murder following the discovery of the victims' bodies - because under the French criminal code, murder is covered by a 10-year statute of limitations. \"It is a terrible situation,\" said Pierre Gonzalez de Gaspard, a lawyer acting for the families of some of the victims. \"No one in France would understand how, if a man being prosecuted for kidnapping can face up to 20 years in prison, he can be released the next day under the statute of limitations if he is actually guilty of murder.\" The case has prompted outrage in France, not just at the prospect of Mr Louis's release but at the shocking lack of concern it has revealed on the part of the social services. The police were never officially informed of the girls' disappearances and it was not until a relatives' group was formed in 1996 that the case was taken seriously. The chief state prosecutor in Auxerre, Marie-Suzanne Le Qu\u00e9au, announced yesterday that Mr Louis had admitted killing the women, aged between 16 and 22, \"after having what he said were fully consensual sexual relations with each of them\". She said the murders were committed over two years during the late 1970s, when Mr Louis - who had a previous conviction for sex offences - regularly transported the victims from their homes to the day care centres. Ms Le Qu\u00e9au added that Mr Louis, who was charged and then later released in 1984 during an investigation into the murder of another young woman in care, had told police where he thought he had buried the bodies, and a major search operation was currently under way.

As sombre workers in white protective gowns watch-ed, a dial showed the output from reactor three dropping slowly to zero.</p> <p>Broadcast live around the world, this simple act marked the conclusion of the tragic history of the Chernobyl atomic power station, site of the world's most devastating nuclear accident 14 years ago.</p> <p>The exact death toll from the disaster remains unknown, but thousands of people in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus have died as a result and millions more have been poisoned by the heavy cloud of radiation emitted by the reactor.</p> <p>The Ukrainian president, Leonid Kuchma, gave the order for the plant to be shut down by video link from a strangely garish state ceremony in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev.</p> <p>\"This decision came from our experience of suffering,\" he declared. \"We understand that Chernobyl is a danger for all of humanity and we forsake a part of our national interests for the sake of global safety.\"</p> <p>Guests from all over the world were there, as the Ukrainian government tried to create an atmosphere of openness - in pointed contrast to the secrecy surrounding the initial catastrophe.</p> <p>At 1.26am on April 26 1986, a series of powerful blasts caused by overheated steam inside the plant devastated Chernobyl's fourth reactor and unleashed a radioactive cloud over Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and much of Europe. The disaster was triggered by an attempt to test the unit's full capacity, during which staff decided to temporarily switch off the safety systems.</p> <p>For days after the explosion, Soviet authorities withheld news of the accident. No one was evacuated from nearby towns and firemen and workers fighting the fire raging at the plant were given little protective equipment.</p> <p>It was only when scient- ists from Sweden became concerned at unusually high radiation levels that information was prised out of Mikhail Gorbachev's administration. By that time tonnes of radioactive strontium, caesium, iodine and plutonium had spewed from the burning shell of the reactor and were spreading across Europe.</p> <p>Ukrainian government figures state that more than 4,000 cleanup workers have died and a further 70,000 have been crippled by radiation poisoning. About 3,400,000 people, including 1,260,000 children, are suffering from fallout-related illnesses.</p> <p>Unofficial statistics put the casualty rates much higher. A World Health Organisation report earlier this year said that a further 50,000 new cases of thyroid cancer were likely to develop in young people living in the worst affected region, known as the Zone.</p> <p>International safety concerns have not been resolved with Chernobyl's closure. The huge million-tonne concrete sarcophagus constructed over the melted ruins of the reactor is cracking, allowing radiation to leak out. Officials have still to decide how the radioactive dust and nuclear fuel inside should be cleaned up.</p> <p>Environmental groups have expressed dismay at a decision by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to help fund the completion of two new nuclear plants in Ukraine to replace Chernobyl. The bank last week agreed, under strict conditions, to lend \u00a3150m to finish partially built plants at Rivne and Khmelnitsky, while the European commission has approved an additional \u00a3340m worth of loans.</p> <p>The plant's workers, most of whom will shortly be unemployed, complain that the repaired reactor was safe to continue working for at least another 10 years and was shut because Ukraine had buckled under western pressure.</p> <p>\u0095Moscow has agreed to allow Norway to inspect an arctic storage area for spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. It was previously off-limits because it is near a key submarine base on the Kola peninsula. The Norwegian government said yesterday that it had earmarked \u00a31.5m for cleaning up Andreeva bay, close to Norway's north-east border.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It fell to the control room engineer Oleksandr Yelchishchev to turn a small plastic switch to the off position yesterday, shutting down the last remaining nuclear reactor at Chernobyl for the final time. It activated an automatic safety system, sending control rods down into the core of the plant. As sombre workers in white protective gowns watch-ed, a dial showed the output from reactor three dropping slowly to zero. Broadcast live around the world, this simple act marked the conclusion of the tragic history of the Chernobyl atomic power station, site of the world's most devastating nuclear accident 14 years ago. The exact death toll from the disaster remains unknown, but thousands of people in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus have died as a result and millions more have been poisoned by the heavy cloud of radiation emitted by the reactor. The Ukrainian president, Leonid Kuchma, gave the order for the plant to be shut down by video link from a strangely garish state ceremony in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. \"This decision came from our experience of suffering,\" he declared. \"We understand that Chernobyl is a danger for all of humanity and we forsake a part of our national interests for the sake of global safety.\" Guests from all over the world were there, as the Ukrainian government tried to create an atmosphere of openness - in pointed contrast to the secrecy surrounding the initial catastrophe. At 1.26am on April 26 1986, a series of powerful blasts caused by overheated steam inside the plant devastated Chernobyl's fourth reactor and unleashed a radioactive cloud over Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and much of Europe. The disaster was triggered by an attempt to test the unit's full capacity, during which staff decided to temporarily switch off the safety systems. For days after the explosion, Soviet authorities withheld news of the accident. No one was evacuated from nearby towns and firemen and workers fighting the fire raging at the plant were given little protective equipment. It was only when scient- ists from Sweden became concerned at unusually high radiation levels that information was prised out of Mikhail Gorbachev's administration. By that time tonnes of radioactive strontium, caesium, iodine and plutonium had spewed from the burning shell of the reactor and were spreading across Europe. Ukrainian government figures state that more than 4,000 cleanup workers have died and a further 70,000 have been crippled by radiation poisoning. About 3,400,000 people, including 1,260,000 children, are suffering from fallout-related illnesses. Unofficial statistics put the casualty rates much higher. A World Health Organisation report earlier this year said that a further 50,000 new cases of thyroid cancer were likely to develop in young people living in the worst affected region, known as the Zone. International safety concerns have not been resolved with Chernobyl's closure. The huge million-tonne concrete sarcophagus constructed over the melted ruins of the reactor is cracking, allowing radiation to leak out. Officials have still to decide how the radioactive dust and nuclear fuel inside should be cleaned up. Environmental groups have expressed dismay at a decision by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to help fund the completion of two new nuclear plants in Ukraine to replace Chernobyl. The bank last week agreed, under strict conditions, to lend \u00a3150m to finish partially built plants at Rivne and Khmelnitsky, while the European commission has approved an additional \u00a3340m worth of loans. The plant's workers, most of whom will shortly be unemployed, complain that the repaired reactor was safe to continue working for at least another 10 years and was shut because Ukraine had buckled under western pressure. \u0095Moscow has agreed to allow Norway to inspect an arctic storage area for spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. It was previously off-limits because it is near a key submarine base on the Kola peninsula. The Norwegian government said yesterday that it had earmarked \u00a31.5m for cleaning up Andreeva bay, close to Norway's north-east border.",

The Israeli army sniper on the 25 metre-high security tower watches the men below scatter and dive for gaps in the concrete wall.</p> <p>As Sergeant Dan Jacobi pulls the trigger, one Palestinian shoves a wooden crate into waiting hands on the Gaza side of the wall: one more lethal cargo slipping past Israeli troops, one more shipment of arms and ammunition for the Palestinian uprising.</p> <p>With the insurrection entering its 12th week, the West Bank and Gaza are awash with illegal weapons - enough to keep the militiamen of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement fighting for months, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The secret trade obscures an embarrassing fact: that the Palestinians are getting their guns straight from the Israeli army's arsenals. In this increasingly vicious guerrilla war, the guns turned on Israeli troops and Jewish settlers are Israel's own.</p> <p>Evidence is emerging that arms are being smuggled from Israeli army weapons depots through a criminal world to the Palestinian militias. Jewish and Arab Israeli arms dealers are acting as middlemen.</p> <p>The steady flow has helped to transform this intifada from a popular uprising into a low-intensity guerrilla war.</p> <p>During the 1987-1993 uprising the Palestinians' favourite weapon was the rock. Nowadays, as Palestinian gunmen spray settlers' cars with bullets in drive-by shootings and Israeli hit squads assassinate suspected militants, the preferred weapon is the American-made M16 assault rifle, which is used by the Israeli army.</p> <p>\"I could sell a thousand guns a day if I wanted to,\" says a gun dealer operating from the West Bank city of Nablus. \"Especially big pieces like the M16.\"</p> <p>Israeli intelligence officials claim that the Palestinian militias - tanzim - have 70,000 guns at the ready: M16s and other automatic rifles mainly, but heavy machine guns, too. \"They are not going to run into any shortage of guns or ammunition,\" an Israeli military official says.</p> <p>Together the move from rocks to rifles and Israel's early use of live rounds and snipers have driven the death toll inexorably upwards. More than 320 people have been killed in the past 11 weeks the vast majority of them Palestinian. In the first 30 months of the more intense 1987 intifada 670 Palestinians died.</p> <p>The weapons shaping the present intifada arrive through a variety of channels. At the Rafah border crossing to Egypt, shipments are tossed over the fence by Egyptian dealers, or slid along tunnels burrowed beneath the border road.</p> <p>Some arms trickle in through Jordan, carried on small boats across the Dead Sea, or by Bedouin trekking over the wind-swept desert hills.</p> <p>Still more travel in air-conditioned luxury, tucked into the Mercedes and Audis of the most privileged Palestinian officials - the lucky few holding VIP-1 status, giving them immunity from security checks. Others are trafficked by organised criminals.</p> <p>But, as officials on both sides agree, most of the illegal guns can be traced back to Israeli army stores. Once stolen, they are spirited away to the West Bank and through a series of shadowy transactions into the hands of the tanzim.</p> <p>A few weeks ago Palestinian gunmen waltzed into an Israeli army tank depot near the West Bank city of Jericho, stripping off four heavy machine guns, and drove off into the desert, Israeli military official says.</p> <p>That was an unusually dramatic incident; most of the theft is done by stealth and betrayal.</p> <p>\"Inside jobs,\" says Mr Ali, who counts himself among the leading suppliers of illegal weapons in the West Bank.</p> <p>He says the most reliable sources are the Israeli army weapons exchanges, where soldiers deposit their guns for maintenance or repair. A raid on these depots typically nets 30 guns for the tanzim : M16s and other automatic rifles, and Uzis. Mr Ali grimaces at the last: Israeli-made guns are not popular with his clients.</p> <p>He describes an elaborate chain, improbably linking a Palestinian gunman with a corrupt Israeli soldier (or officer) who organises the disappearance of weapons from the army stores.</p> <p>Mr Ali says the trade hinges on a rogue soldier. \"It takes a leader, someone in command, to make it work.\"</p> <p>The senior Israeli military official cannot deny it.\"We have had cases like that. I can't rule it out.\"</p> <p>Mr Ali says the betrayal is driven by money or drugs. But once a soldier decides to steal, there are many willing buyers among Israeli criminals, Jewish and Arab. The Israeli gun dealers then exchange the stolen arms for cash or drugs from their Palestinian counterparts, who move them on to small-scale weapons traders or the militias.</p> <p>The paymaster behind all these transactions is alleged to be the Fatah organisation, which then sells the guns on to the tanzim , or, according to some militia members, doles them out for free.</p> <p>Moving the guns inside the West Bank has become trickier because of Israel's economic blockade, however - new restrictions ban cars carrying only Palestinian males. Such laws have forced Israeli dealers to making drop-offs in the stoney hills of the West Bank, or employing female couriers to charm their way past soldiers at checkpoints.</p> <p>A week ago the Balata refugee camp militia, one of the toughest, got an unexpected gift when a Jewish settler drove into the West Bank with a shipment of 12,000 bullets.</p> <p>\"I swear to God a Jewish person passed in front of the Israeli soldiers with this,\" says Majid al-Massri, the militia commander. \"Do you know how much money he made? Thirteen thousand shekels [about \u00a32,150].\"</p> <p>Mr Massri's arsenal includes a wide array of weapons. Aside from the Iraqi-made, nickel-plated pistol at his hip, he has a fondness for a cache of 52 M16s emblazoned with cypress trees - the national symbol of Lebanon - stolen from the South Lebanese Army, Israel's proxy militia, by departing troops during Israel's withdrawal last May.</p> <p>Mr Massri has no shortage of guns or ammunition to choose; his only problem is price, driven up by the Israeli economic blockade and spiralling demand.</p> <p>A single M16 round now sells for up to two shekels (about 30p), double the price before the uprising. Rounds for Kalashnikov sell for seven shekels each, out of range for the militias.</p> <p>Gun prices have also soared. On the street, where prices are customarily quoted in Jordanian dinars, the going rate for a M16 is 3,500 dinars (\u00a33,350), up from 2,000 dinars.</p> <p><b> Limited firepower</b><br></p> <p>Nobody expects the trafficking of illegal weapons to end when the intifada stops. Gun running is a product of peace, the result of the loosening of controls over Palestinian enclaves which came with the Oslo agreements.</p> <p>The peace agreements gave the Palestinians the right to raise police forces in the West Bank and Gaza, but severely limited their firepower. The Palestinian Authority was also obliged to hunt down and confiscate illegal private firearms.</p> <p>It did not. Over the last six years, guns have become a symbol of family honour. In some West Bank refugee camps they are displayed like university diplomas.</p> <p>Israel accuses the Palestinians of breaking its promise to round up illegal guns by collecting only a token amount of weapons. \"They made no effort to confiscate arms, and the guns stayed in the hands of the tanzim and of Hamas,\" the senior Israeli military official said.</p> <p>The Palestinians say this is unfair. \"Israel manufactures guns and controls all the borders,\" says Colonel Kamal al-Sheikh, the Palestinian police chief in Ramallah. \"We don't manufacture guns, and we don't control the borders.

      "bodyText": "Three shots ring out in the still of the afternoon, and three Palestinians run for cover. The Israeli army sniper on the 25 metre-high security tower watches the men below scatter and dive for gaps in the concrete wall. As Sergeant Dan Jacobi pulls the trigger, one Palestinian shoves a wooden crate into waiting hands on the Gaza side of the wall: one more lethal cargo slipping past Israeli troops, one more shipment of arms and ammunition for the Palestinian uprising. With the insurrection entering its 12th week, the West Bank and Gaza are awash with illegal weapons - enough to keep the militiamen of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement fighting for months, the Guardian has learned. The secret trade obscures an embarrassing fact: that the Palestinians are getting their guns straight from the Israeli army's arsenals. In this increasingly vicious guerrilla war, the guns turned on Israeli troops and Jewish settlers are Israel's own. Evidence is emerging that arms are being smuggled from Israeli army weapons depots through a criminal world to the Palestinian militias. Jewish and Arab Israeli arms dealers are acting as middlemen. The steady flow has helped to transform this intifada from a popular uprising into a low-intensity guerrilla war. During the 1987-1993 uprising the Palestinians' favourite weapon was the rock. Nowadays, as Palestinian gunmen spray settlers' cars with bullets in drive-by shootings and Israeli hit squads assassinate suspected militants, the preferred weapon is the American-made M16 assault rifle, which is used by the Israeli army. \"I could sell a thousand guns a day if I wanted to,\" says a gun dealer operating from the West Bank city of Nablus. \"Especially big pieces like the M16.\" Israeli intelligence officials claim that the Palestinian militias - tanzim - have 70,000 guns at the ready: M16s and other automatic rifles mainly, but heavy machine guns, too. \"They are not going to run into any shortage of guns or ammunition,\" an Israeli military official says. Together the move from rocks to rifles and Israel's early use of live rounds and snipers have driven the death toll inexorably upwards. More than 320 people have been killed in the past 11 weeks the vast majority of them Palestinian. In the first 30 months of the more intense 1987 intifada 670 Palestinians died. The weapons shaping the present intifada arrive through a variety of channels. At the Rafah border crossing to Egypt, shipments are tossed over the fence by Egyptian dealers, or slid along tunnels burrowed beneath the border road. Some arms trickle in through Jordan, carried on small boats across the Dead Sea, or by Bedouin trekking over the wind-swept desert hills. Still more travel in air-conditioned luxury, tucked into the Mercedes and Audis of the most privileged Palestinian officials - the lucky few holding VIP-1 status, giving them immunity from security checks. Others are trafficked by organised criminals. But, as officials on both sides agree, most of the illegal guns can be traced back to Israeli army stores. Once stolen, they are spirited away to the West Bank and through a series of shadowy transactions into the hands of the tanzim. A few weeks ago Palestinian gunmen waltzed into an Israeli army tank depot near the West Bank city of Jericho, stripping off four heavy machine guns, and drove off into the desert, Israeli military official says. That was an unusually dramatic incident; most of the theft is done by stealth and betrayal. \"Inside jobs,\" says Mr Ali, who counts himself among the leading suppliers of illegal weapons in the West Bank. He says the most reliable sources are the Israeli army weapons exchanges, where soldiers deposit their guns for maintenance or repair. A raid on these depots typically nets 30 guns for the tanzim : M16s and other automatic rifles, and Uzis. Mr Ali grimaces at the last: Israeli-made guns are not popular with his clients. He describes an elaborate chain, improbably linking a Palestinian gunman with a corrupt Israeli soldier (or officer) who organises the disappearance of weapons from the army stores. Mr Ali says the trade hinges on a rogue soldier. \"It takes a leader, someone in command, to make it work.\" The senior Israeli military official cannot deny it.\"We have had cases like that. I can't rule it out.\" Mr Ali says the betrayal is driven by money or drugs. But once a soldier decides to steal, there are many willing buyers among Israeli criminals, Jewish and Arab. The Israeli gun dealers then exchange the stolen arms for cash or drugs from their Palestinian counterparts, who move them on to small-scale weapons traders or the militias. The paymaster behind all these transactions is alleged to be the Fatah organisation, which then sells the guns on to the tanzim , or, according to some militia members, doles them out for free. Moving the guns inside the West Bank has become trickier because of Israel's economic blockade, however - new restrictions ban cars carrying only Palestinian males. Such laws have forced Israeli dealers to making drop-offs in the stoney hills of the West Bank, or employing female couriers to charm their way past soldiers at checkpoints. A week ago the Balata refugee camp militia, one of the toughest, got an unexpected gift when a Jewish settler drove into the West Bank with a shipment of 12,000 bullets. \"I swear to God a Jewish person passed in front of the Israeli soldiers with this,\" says Majid al-Massri, the militia commander. \"Do you know how much money he made? Thirteen thousand shekels [about \u00a32,150].\" Mr Massri's arsenal includes a wide array of weapons. Aside from the Iraqi-made, nickel-plated pistol at his hip, he has a fondness for a cache of 52 M16s emblazoned with cypress trees - the national symbol of Lebanon - stolen from the South Lebanese Army, Israel's proxy militia, by departing troops during Israel's withdrawal last May. Mr Massri has no shortage of guns or ammunition to choose; his only problem is price, driven up by the Israeli economic blockade and spiralling demand. A single M16 round now sells for up to two shekels (about 30p), double the price before the uprising. Rounds for Kalashnikov sell for seven shekels each, out of range for the militias. Gun prices have also soared. On the street, where prices are customarily quoted in Jordanian dinars, the going rate for a M16 is 3,500 dinars (\u00a33,350), up from 2,000 dinars. Limited firepower Nobody expects the trafficking of illegal weapons to end when the intifada stops. Gun running is a product of peace, the result of the loosening of controls over Palestinian enclaves which came with the Oslo agreements. The peace agreements gave the Palestinians the right to raise police forces in the West Bank and Gaza, but severely limited their firepower. The Palestinian Authority was also obliged to hunt down and confiscate illegal private firearms. It did not. Over the last six years, guns have become a symbol of family honour. In some West Bank refugee camps they are displayed like university diplomas. Israel accuses the Palestinians of breaking its promise to round up illegal guns by collecting only a token amount of weapons. \"They made no effort to confiscate arms, and the guns stayed in the hands of the tanzim and of Hamas,\" the senior Israeli military official said. The Palestinians say this is unfair. \"Israel manufactures guns and controls all the borders,\" says Colonel Kamal al-Sheikh, the Palestinian police chief in Ramallah. \"We don't manufacture guns, and we don't control the borders. So tell me, who is responsible for the gun smuggling?\" He argues that the authorities in Ramallah did confiscate illegal guns - albeit a laughable total of 28, some of them of second world war vintage. In times of conflict the rules change, and the Palestinians have no intention of disarming the \"tens and thousands\" of militiamen now bearing arms, Col Sheikh says. \"We are not about to confiscate those while Israeli soldiers and settlers are shooting at Palestinians.\" Col Sheikh and other Palestinian officials have a convincing counter-argument to Israel's charges. They claim that Israeli security and intelligence forces keep a close eye on the trafficking of arms to the Palestinian militias, and to the underworld. But Israel secretly encourages the trade - even now - hoping to provoke a civil war that will see Palestinians turn their guns on each other once the battle with Israel is over and a peace deal struck. If Mr Arafat agrees to an unpopular deal, he could face armed opponents who resist handing over their guns. That would make it practically impossible for Mr Arafat to enforce an eventual truce, and move beyond the cycle of killing and revenge that now consumes both peoples. Even if there is a deal, the gun could still rule. Many of the fighters now aiming their guns at Jewish settlements also believe that they are operating with Israel's tacit approval. \"If they want to stop a fly from getting to Bethlehem they can, so I don't know why they cannot control the ammunition coming in,\" says a militia commander directing gunfire against the Jewish settlement of Gilo from the Palestinian town of Beit Jalla. The commander, who gave only his first name - Mike - added: \"You cannot just put 20, 30 or 40,000 bullets in your pocket and just walk in. Someone has to want you to.\"",

      "body": "<p>Although dusk was in sight, the moist, breezy Memphis air still felt mosquito-muggy inside and outside. It was May 1997 and Jeff Buckley, who had turned 30 about six months earlier, emerged from his bedroom in black jeans, ankle-high black boots, and a white T-shirt with long black sleeves and \"Altamont\" (in honour of the Rolling Stones' anarchic, death-shrouded 1969 concert) inscribed on it. Though officially out of his 20s, he remained a rock'n'roll kid at heart. As he and his tour manager Gene Bowen stood outside on the front porch, Jeff said he was heading out for a while. Generally Bowen would accompany Jeff on expeditions while on tour, but tonight Bowen needed space. Some mattresses would be delivered shortly, and the last thing he needed was Jeff bouncing around the house when they arrived.</p> <p>So, when Jeff told Bowen he would be leaving with Keith Foti, Bowen was mostly relieved. Foti was even more of a character than Jeff was. A fledgling songwriter and musician and a full-time haircutter in New York City, Foti had accompanied Bowen from New York to Memphis in a rented van, the band's gear and instruments crammed in the back. Stocky and wide-faced, with spiky, blue-dyed hair, Foti, who was 23, could have been the star of a Saturday morning cartoon show about a punk rock band.</p> <p>Jeff told Bowen that he and Foti had decided to drive to the rehearsal space the band would be using during the upcoming weeks. Bowen told them to be back at the house by nine to greet the band. Jeff said fine, and he and Foti ambled down the gravel driveway to the van parked in front of the house.</p> <p>Suddenly it dawned on Bowen: did Jeff and Foti know where the rehearsal space was? For non-natives, Memphis's layout can be confusing; it wouldn't be hard to get lost or suddenly find one's self in a dicey part of town. Bowen bolted through the front door, but the van was already gone. Oh, well, he thought, they'll find the building. After all, they had been there just yesterday.</p> <p>Cruising around Memphis in their bright yellow Ryder van, past weathered shacks, barbecue joints, pawnshops and strip malls, Jeff and Foti made for an unusual sight. Foti was in the driver's seat, which was for the best; Jeff was an erratic driver. They cranked one of Foti's mix tapes, and the two of them sang along to the Beatles' I Am The Walrus, John Lennon's Imagine and Jane's Addiction's Three Days. Foti and Jeff both loved Jane's Addiction and its shamanesque, hard-living singer, Perry Farrell. It took Jeff back to the days in the late 80s when he was living and starving in Los Angeles, trying to make a name for himself.</p> <p>It wasn't Jeff's fault that he shared some vocal and physical characteristics with his father and fellow musician, Tim Buckley. Both men had the same sorrowful glances, thick eyebrows and delicate, waifish airs that made women of all ages want to comfort and nurture them. It wasn't Jeff's fault, either, that he inherited Tim's vocal range, five-and-a-half octaves that let Tim's voice spiral from a soft caress into bouts of rapturous, orgasmic sensuality. In the 60s, Tim wrote and sang melodies that blended folk, jazz, art song and R&amp;B; he had a large cult following himself, and some of those songs had been recorded by the likes of Linda Ronstadt and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears.</p> <p>When Jeff had begun writing his own music, he, too, moved in unconventional ways, crafting rhapsodies that changed time signatures and leapt from folkish delicacy to full-throttle metal roar. None of this, he insisted, came from his father's influence. His biggest rock influence and favourite band was, he said, Led Zeppelin. To his friends, Jeff talked about his bootleg of Physical Graffiti out-takes with more affection and fannish enthusiasm than he ever did about the nine albums his father had recorded during the 60s and 70s.</p> <p>Tonight, for once, Tim's ghost was not lurking in the rearview mirror. If anything, Jeff seemed at peace with his father's memory for perhaps the first time in his life. Whenever Jeff had mentioned Tim in the past, it was with flashes of irritation or resignation. He sounded as if he were discussing a far-off celebrity, not a father or even a family member. In a way, Tim was barely either: he and his first wife, Mary Guibert, had separated before Jeff was born, and Jeff had been raised to view Tim's life and music warily. But in the past few months, Jeff seemed to have begun to understand his father's music and, more importantly, his motivations.</p> <p>Jeff's years in Los Angeles hadn't been fruitful, but when he moved to New York in the autumn of 1991, a buzz began building around the skinny, charismatic kid with the big-as-a-cathedral voice and the eclectic repertoire. Many record companies came calling, and he eventually, hesitatingly, put his name on a contract with one of them, Columbia. After an initial EP, an album, Grace, finally appeared in 1994. A brilliant sprawl of a work, the album traversed the musical map, daring listeners to find the common ground that linked its choral pieces, Zeppelin-dipped rock and amorous cabaret. Certainly one of the links was Jeff's voice, an intense and seemingly freewheeling instrument that wasn't afraid to glide from operatic highs and overpowering shrieks to a conversational intimacy.</p> <p>Beyond being simply one of the most moving albums of the 90s, Grace branded Jeff as an actual, hype-be-damned talent for the age. The record business was always eager to promote newcomers in such a manner, but here was someone with both a sense of musical history and seemingly limitless potential. Like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison before him, he appeared to be on the road to a long and commanding career in which even a creative misstep or two would be worth poring over. Comparisons with Tim were inevitable, and a disturbing number of fortysomethings had materialised at Jeff's concerts to ask him about his father. But, much to Jeff's relief, the comparisons had begun to diminish with each passing month.</p> <p>Grace hadn't been the smash hit Columbia would have liked, but worldwide it had sold nearly 750,000 copies, and it was talked up by everyone from Paul McCartney and U2 to Zeppelin's Robert Plant and Jimmy Page. Fans in Britain, Australia and France adored him even more passionately than those in America. To his managers and record company, Jeff was a shining star, a gateway to prestige, money and credibility. A very great deal was riding on the songs he was testing out on the four-track recorder in the living room of his house in Memphis. Jeff didn't like to think about those pressures, which is partly why he moved 1,000 miles away from New York. Here, he could think, write, create.</p> <p>The drive from Jeff's house to Young Avenue, where the rehearsal room was located, should have taken 10 minutes down a few tree-lined streets. But something was wrong. Before Jeff and Foti knew it, nearly an hour had passed and there was still no sign of the two-storey red-brick building. They found themselves circling around a variety of neighbourhoods, past underpasses for Interstate 240 and pawnshops. To Foti, everything began to look the same.</p> <p>Jeff had an idea. \"Why don't we go down to the river?\" he said. It sounded good to Foti, who had brought along his guitar and felt like practising a song he was writing. Having a talented, well-regarded rock star as an audience wouldn't be so bad, either.</p> <p>The Wolf River did not look particularly wolfish; it barely had the feel of a river. The city government had passed an ordinance banning swimming, but no signs indicated this restriction. According to locals, there didn't have to be, since everyone in Memphis knew it was far from an ideal swimming hole. The first six inches of water could be warm and innocuous-looking, but thanks to the intersection with the Mississippi the undercurrents were deceptive. All day long and into the early hours of the morning, 200ft-long barges carrying goods from the local granaries and a cement factory hauled their cargo up and down the Wolf. With their churning motors, the tugboats that pulled the barges were even fiercer and had been known to create strong wakes. Local coastguard employees had once witnessed a 16ft flat-bottom boat being sucked under the water in the wake of a tug. Memphis lore had it that at least one person a year drowned in the Wolf.</p> <p>Even if Jeff had heard these stories, he either didn't care or disregarded them. Hopping over a 3ft-high brick wall, Jeff and Foti strode across a cement promenade strewn with picnic tables. Then Jeff hiked his black combat boots on to the bottom rung on the steel rail that ran alongside the promenade and jumped over. Foti, gripping his guitar, followed, and they found themselves barrelling down a steep slope, swishing through knee-high brush, ivy and weeds.</p> <p>On the way down, Jeff shed his coat - just dropped it in the brush. \"You're not gonna leave it here, are you?\" Foti asked, stopping quickly to pick it up. Jeff didn't seem to be listening. Carrying Foti's boom box, he continued down to the riverbank. The shore was littered with rocks, soda cans and shattered glass bottles, and it quickly sloped into the water just inches away. As gentle waves lapped on to the shoreline, Jeff set Foti's boom box on one of the many jagged slate rocks on the bank, just an inch or so above the water. \"Hey, man, don't put my radio there,\" Foti told him. \"I don't want it going in the water. It's my only unit of sound.\" Jeff didn't seem to pay particular attention to that request, either.</p> <p>By now, just after 9pm, Foti had strapped on his guitar and started practising his song. Looking right at Foti, Jeff took a step or two away, his back to the river. Before Foti knew it, Jeff was knee-high in the water. \"What are you doin', man?\" Foti said. Within moments, Jeff's entire body eased into the water, and he began doing a backstroke.</p> <p>At first, Foti wasn't too concerned: Jeff was still directly offshore, just a few feet away. He and Foti began musing about life and music as Jeff backstroked around in circles. \"You know, the first one's fun, man - it's that second one ... \" Jeff said, his voice trailing off as he continued to backstroke in the water.</p> <p>With each stroke, Jeff inched more and more out into the river. Foti noticed and said, \"Come in, you're gettin' too far out.\" Instead, Jeff began singing Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love. \"He was just on his own at that point,\" Foti says. \"He didn't really observe my concerns.\" Jeff had an impetuous, spur-of-the-moment streak. Many of his friends considered it one of his most endearing qualities; others worried that it bordered on recklessness. Like his father, he liked to follow his muse, to leap into projects passionately and spontaneously, even if they weren't fashionable or appropriate. Take that night in 1975. Tim was on his way home from a gruelling tour. His record sales were in freefall, but lately he had tried to cut back on his drinking and drugging, and was attempting to get his music and even a potential acting career on track. On the way home from the last stop on his tour, he stopped by the home of a friend, who offered up a few drugs. What was wrong with a little pick-me-up after some exhausting road work? No one knew if Tim realised exactly what he had snorted that late afternoon, but it ultimately didn't matter; he died that night of an overdose at the age of 28.</p> <p>Although Jeff had experimented with drugs, he steered clear to avoid his father's fate, both physically and artistically; he had learned from Tim's mistakes in the matters of artistic integrity and handling the music business. Onstage, Jeff would often make cracks about dead rock stars, pretending to shoot up or breaking into spot-on mimicry of anyone from Jim Morrison to Elvis Presley. Once this new album was completed, he was planning to dig deeper into his family heritage and unearth the truth behind the seemingly ongoing series of tragedies that haunted his lineage.</p> <p>Tonight, as he backstroked in the water, Jeff appeared to feel freer than he had in a while. The mere fact that he was in water was a sign of change. Although he had grown up near the beaches of Southern California, Jeff was never a beachcomber.</p> <p>It was now close to 9.15pm, and Jeff had been in the river nearly 15 minutes. His boots and trousers must gradually have become more sodden and heavy. He began swimming further toward the centre of the river, circling around before drifting to the left of Foti. Then he began swimming straight across to the other side, or so it appeared to Foti. Directly across from them, on the opposite bank, was a dirt road that ran right up from the river. It looked so close - maybe Jeff felt he could reach it and take a quick stroll.</p> <p>The tugboat came first, moments later. \"Jeff, man, there's a boat coming,\" Foti said. \"Get out of the fucking water.\" The boat was heading in their direction, up from Beale Street. Jeff seemed to take notice of it and made sure to be clear of it as it passed. The next time Foti looked over, he still saw Jeff's head bobbing in the water.</p> <p>Not more than a minute had passed when Foti spied another boat approaching. This one was bigger - a barge, perhaps 100ft long. Foti grew more concerned and started yelling louder for Jeff to come back. Once again, Jeff swam out of its path, and Foti breathed another sigh of relief. In the increasing darkness, the speck that was Jeff's head was just barely visible.</p> <p>Soon, the water grew choppy, the waves lapping a little more firmly against the riverbank. Foti grew worried about his boom box. The last thing he wanted was to see it waterlogged and unusable. Taking his eye off Jeff for a moment, he stepped over to where Jeff had set the stereo down on a rock and moved it back about five feet, out of reach of the waves. Foti turned back around. There was no longer a head in the water. There was nothing - just stillness, a few rippling aftershock waves, and the marina in the distance. Foti began to scream out Jeff's name. There was no answer. He yelled more. He continued screaming for nearly 10 minutes.</p> <p>On the other side of the river, Gordon Archibald, a 59-year-old employee of the marina, was walking near the moored boats with a friend when he heard a single shout of \"help\". Concerned, he looked out on to the water. But he saw nothing, nor heard anything more.</p> <p>The folk singer Tim Buckley, who was to become Jeff's father, married Mary Guibert in 1965.</p> <p>It was spring 1966, Mary Guibert was three months pregnant, 18 years old, and Tim was out of town. Even before Tim left for New York, his wife suspected he was spending time with other women. \"By no stretch of the imagination was this a marriage made in heaven,\" she says. \"He hadn't been faithful to me for very long. And I thought that was perfectly acceptable because, after all, he was so wonderful, and I was so nobody.\"</p> <p>Mary says she told Tim about the pregnancy before he left for New York, but that he told her he had to leave town and that she should move back in with her family in Orange County, near LA, get a job, save money, and \"maybe get an abortion or whatever you want to do\", she recalls him saying. Even then, Tim made no mention of another woman. \"I just had no idea,\" Mary says. \"A lot of denial going on. Tons of denial on both sides, because he wouldn't bring himself, to the very end, to say, 'You know, I really don't love you very much'.\" She sent Tim letters to various addresses in New York; his replies came fitfully and were pointedly vague. Finally, a mutual friend gave her the news: Tim was in New York with a new girlfriend, and would be back in Los Angeles shortly.</p> <p>Lee Underwood, guitarist in Buckley's band and a great friend, recalls the situation being a topic of discussion while he and Tim were in New York that summer. Given the choice of returning to Mary and Orange County or following what Underwood calls \"his destined natural way\", Tim \"decided to be true to himself and his music, fully aware that he would be accepting a lifetime burden of guilt. Tim left, not because he didn't care about his soon-to-be-born child but because his musical life was just beginning; in addition, he couldn't stand Mary. He did not abandon Jeff; he abandoned Mary.\"</p> <p>Finally, some action had to be taken. Tim came to meet Mary at a coffee shop near her home. What exactly happened remains unclear. Tim never talked to his friends about it, while Anna Guibert, Mary's mother, recalls Tim giving Mary an ultimatum: divorce or abortion. According to Mary, she asked Tim what they should do about the marriage and pregnancy, and he replied, \"You do whatever you have to do, baby\", and hung his head.</p> <p>Afterwards, Mary, who was by now many months pregnant, walked home, told her mother the news and cried. As Anna Guibert remembers, \"I said, 'That's the best thing, honey. If he doesn't want you, be free.' She was crazy about Tim. But he wanted his career. There was no place for a baby in his life.\"Mary, however, did want her baby.</p> <p>He was born on Thursday, November 17, 1966, at 10.49pm, after 21 hours of labour. The issue of identity loomed even before the child left the hospital. Mary named her son Jeffrey Scott - \"Jeffrey\" after her last high-school boyfriend before Tim (\"my last pure boy-girl relationship, my last pure moment\") and \"Scott\" in honour of John Scott Jr, a neighbour and close friend of the Guiberts who died in an accident at the age of 17. Yet because Mary preferred Scott, the child was instantly called Scotty by his family. Tim was not available for consultation, since no one knew his whereabouts.</p> <p>At school, Scotty was the eternal clown, making jokes, craving attention and being more interested in music (including cello lessons provided by the school) than grades. His second-floor bedroom became a rock enclave, his most valuable possessions being a Hemispheres picture disc by the prog-rock band Rush and all four of Kiss's solo albums.</p> <p>He had a guitar given to him by his grandmother, and although he hadn't learned to master it, he would sit and cradle it, \"like Linus's blanket\", according to Willie Osborn, his childhood friend. Although Jeff had taken his father's name, his music tastes reflected none of Tim's influence. He was just eight years old when Tim died; they had had their only proper encounter just months before.</p> <p>The meeting between Tim and Jeff Buckley, April 1975.</p> <p>Mary Guibert was flipping through a local newspaper when she saw a listing for Tim Buckley's upcoming show. It was, she says, \"an epiphany\". It had been six years since she and her first husband had seen each other, and nearly as long since they had spoken. Mary and Jeff took the hour-long drive to Huntington Beach, an oceanside town 10 miles southwest of Orange County, and arrived at the Golden Bear just before Tim walked on-stage. They took a seat on a bench in the second row.</p> <p>Jeff seemed enraptured, bouncing in his seat to the rhythms of Tim's 12-string guitar and rock band. \"Scotty was in love,\" Mary says. \"He was immediately entranced. His little eyes were just dancing in his head.\" To Mary, Tim was still a dynamic performer, bouncing on his heels with his eyes shut, but she also felt he looked careworn for someone still in his 20s.</p> <p>At the end of the set, no sooner had Mary asked her son if he wanted to meet his father than the kid was out of his seat and scurrying in the direction of the backstage area. As they entered the cramped dressing room, Jeff clutched his mother's long skirt. It seemed a foreign and frightening world to him, until he heard someone shout out, \"Jeff!\" Although no one had called him that before in his life - he was still \"Scotty\" to everyone - Jeff ran across the room to a table where Tim was resting after the show.</p> <p>Tim hoisted his son on to his knees and began rocking him back and forth with a smile as Jeff gave his father a crash course on his life, rattling off his age, the name of his dog, his teachers, his half-brother and other vital statistics. \"I sat on his knees for 15 minutes,\" Jeff wrote later. \"He was hot and sweaty. I kept on feeling his legs. 'Wow, you need an iceberg to cool you off!' I was very embarrassing - doing my George Carlin impression for him for no reason. Very embarrassing. He smiled the whole time. Me too.\"</p> <p>Tim's drummer, Buddy Helm, recalls. \"It was a very personal moment. The kid seemed very genuine, totally in love with his dad. It was like wanting to connect. He didn't know anything personally about Tim but was there ready to do it.\" The same seemed to be true of Tim; after years of distance from his son, he seemed to feel it was time to re-cement whatever bond existed between them.</p> <p>Shortly after, before the second set began, Judy, Tim's new partner, asked Mary if it would be acceptable for Jeff to spend a few days at their place: Tim would be leaving soon on tour, but had some free time. It was the start of the Easter break, so Mary agreed. Next morning, she packed Jeff's clothes in a brown paper bag and drove him to Santa Monica to spend his most extended period of time with his father.</p> <p>Tim and Judy lived a few blocks from the beach. As Jeff remembered it, the following five days - the first week of April 1975 - were largely uneventful. \"Easter vacation came around,\" he wrote in 1990. \"I went over for a week or so, we made small talk at dinner, watched cable TV, he bought me a model airplane on one of our 'outings' ... Nothing much but it was kind of memorable.\" Three years later, he recalled it with much more bitterness: \"He was working in his room, so I didn't even get to talk to him. And that was it.\"</p> <p>Mary recalls Jeff telling her that he would dash into Tim's room every morning and bounce on the bed. At the end of his stay, Tim and Judy put Jeff on a bus out of Santa Monica, and Mary picked him up at the bus station in Fullerton. When Jeff stepped off, she noticed he was clutching a book of matches. On it, Tim had written his phone number.</p> <p>By his teens, Jeff was exhibiting impressive musical skills, as another school band member, drummer Paul Derech, discovered when he visited Jeff in the Guibert home in early 1982. Sitting on his bed, Jeff played songs from Al Di Meola's Electric Rendezvous and the first album by Asia. Even though Derech had to listen closely to Jeff's guitar - Mary couldn't yet afford an amplifier for her son - his dexterity was so apparent that Derech literally took a step back.</p> <p>Once, Jeff pulled out a picture of Tim from his closet and softly said, \"I've spent a lot of time looking at that picture\", before moving on to another topic. Derech, like other kids, sensed immediately that his father was a sore point. Instead, they talked music. Although punk and new wave were the predominant rock styles of the moment, Jeff had little interest in them. He preferred music that challenged him and transported him to imaginary worlds. In the late 70s and early 80s, that music was prog (short for progressive) and art rock - bands such as Yes, Genesis and Rush that revelled in complex structures, science-fiction-themed lyrics and virtuosic, fleet- fingered guitar parts that only a few teenagers could hope to master. In a friend's garage, Jeff and Derech soon began jamming on versions of Rush songs. Jeff declined to sing, though; he told friends and family he wanted to be a guitarist, plain and simple.</p> <p>The reason, some felt, was because he didn't want to be compared to the musician father he barely knew. \"He had exactly the same speaking voice as Tim,\" recalls Tamurlaine, the daughter of Herb Cohen, Tim's one-time manager. She befriended Jeff when he and Mary would visit the Cohen family for dinner. (Cohen and Mary kept in touch after Tim and Mary's break-up.) During those meals, Jeff's vocal and physical resemblance to his father led Cohen often to mistakenly call Jeff \"Tim\".</p> <p>Jeff moved to New York City in 1990.</p> <p>Often sporting his black Hendrix T-shirt, Jeff immediately took to New York, hauling his guitar into the subway to play for change and roaming the streets. \"I talked to him right after he got to New York and he was loving it,\" recalls his friend Tony Marryatt, a fellow student at Musicians Institute in Hollywood. \"He said it was just like a Woody Allen movie.\" To support himself, he took a series of day jobs, from working at an answering service (for actors such as F Murray Abraham and Denzel Washington) to being an assistant at a Banana Republic clothes store.</p> <p>Read the second part of Remember me? <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,411998,00.html\"> here</a>.</p> <p>\u00a9 David Browne 2001.

      "bodyText": "Although dusk was in sight, the moist, breezy Memphis air still felt mosquito-muggy inside and outside. It was May 1997 and Jeff Buckley, who had turned 30 about six months earlier, emerged from his bedroom in black jeans, ankle-high black boots, and a white T-shirt with long black sleeves and \"Altamont\" (in honour of the Rolling Stones' anarchic, death-shrouded 1969 concert) inscribed on it. Though officially out of his 20s, he remained a rock'n'roll kid at heart. As he and his tour manager Gene Bowen stood outside on the front porch, Jeff said he was heading out for a while. Generally Bowen would accompany Jeff on expeditions while on tour, but tonight Bowen needed space. Some mattresses would be delivered shortly, and the last thing he needed was Jeff bouncing around the house when they arrived. So, when Jeff told Bowen he would be leaving with Keith Foti, Bowen was mostly relieved. Foti was even more of a character than Jeff was. A fledgling songwriter and musician and a full-time haircutter in New York City, Foti had accompanied Bowen from New York to Memphis in a rented van, the band's gear and instruments crammed in the back. Stocky and wide-faced, with spiky, blue-dyed hair, Foti, who was 23, could have been the star of a Saturday morning cartoon show about a punk rock band. Jeff told Bowen that he and Foti had decided to drive to the rehearsal space the band would be using during the upcoming weeks. Bowen told them to be back at the house by nine to greet the band. Jeff said fine, and he and Foti ambled down the gravel driveway to the van parked in front of the house. Suddenly it dawned on Bowen: did Jeff and Foti know where the rehearsal space was? For non-natives, Memphis's layout can be confusing; it wouldn't be hard to get lost or suddenly find one's self in a dicey part of town. Bowen bolted through the front door, but the van was already gone. Oh, well, he thought, they'll find the building. After all, they had been there just yesterday. Cruising around Memphis in their bright yellow Ryder van, past weathered shacks, barbecue joints, pawnshops and strip malls, Jeff and Foti made for an unusual sight. Foti was in the driver's seat, which was for the best; Jeff was an erratic driver. They cranked one of Foti's mix tapes, and the two of them sang along to the Beatles' I Am The Walrus, John Lennon's Imagine and Jane's Addiction's Three Days. Foti and Jeff both loved Jane's Addiction and its shamanesque, hard-living singer, Perry Farrell. It took Jeff back to the days in the late 80s when he was living and starving in Los Angeles, trying to make a name for himself. It wasn't Jeff's fault that he shared some vocal and physical characteristics with his father and fellow musician, Tim Buckley. Both men had the same sorrowful glances, thick eyebrows and delicate, waifish airs that made women of all ages want to comfort and nurture them. It wasn't Jeff's fault, either, that he inherited Tim's vocal range, five-and-a-half octaves that let Tim's voice spiral from a soft caress into bouts of rapturous, orgasmic sensuality. In the 60s, Tim wrote and sang melodies that blended folk, jazz, art song and R&amp;B; he had a large cult following himself, and some of those songs had been recorded by the likes of Linda Ronstadt and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears. When Jeff had begun writing his own music, he, too, moved in unconventional ways, crafting rhapsodies that changed time signatures and leapt from folkish delicacy to full-throttle metal roar. None of this, he insisted, came from his father's influence. His biggest rock influence and favourite band was, he said, Led Zeppelin. To his friends, Jeff talked about his bootleg of Physical Graffiti out-takes with more affection and fannish enthusiasm than he ever did about the nine albums his father had recorded during the 60s and 70s. Tonight, for once, Tim's ghost was not lurking in the rearview mirror. If anything, Jeff seemed at peace with his father's memory for perhaps the first time in his life. Whenever Jeff had mentioned Tim in the past, it was with flashes of irritation or resignation. He sounded as if he were discussing a far-off celebrity, not a father or even a family member. In a way, Tim was barely either: he and his first wife, Mary Guibert, had separated before Jeff was born, and Jeff had been raised to view Tim's life and music warily. But in the past few months, Jeff seemed to have begun to understand his father's music and, more importantly, his motivations. Jeff's years in Los Angeles hadn't been fruitful, but when he moved to New York in the autumn of 1991, a buzz began building around the skinny, charismatic kid with the big-as-a-cathedral voice and the eclectic repertoire. Many record companies came calling, and he eventually, hesitatingly, put his name on a contract with one of them, Columbia. After an initial EP, an album, Grace, finally appeared in 1994. A brilliant sprawl of a work, the album traversed the musical map, daring listeners to find the common ground that linked its choral pieces, Zeppelin-dipped rock and amorous cabaret. Certainly one of the links was Jeff's voice, an intense and seemingly freewheeling instrument that wasn't afraid to glide from operatic highs and overpowering shrieks to a conversational intimacy. Beyond being simply one of the most moving albums of the 90s, Grace branded Jeff as an actual, hype-be-damned talent for the age. The record business was always eager to promote newcomers in such a manner, but here was someone with both a sense of musical history and seemingly limitless potential. Like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison before him, he appeared to be on the road to a long and commanding career in which even a creative misstep or two would be worth poring over. Comparisons with Tim were inevitable, and a disturbing number of fortysomethings had materialised at Jeff's concerts to ask him about his father. But, much to Jeff's relief, the comparisons had begun to diminish with each passing month. Grace hadn't been the smash hit Columbia would have liked, but worldwide it had sold nearly 750,000 copies, and it was talked up by everyone from Paul McCartney and U2 to Zeppelin's Robert Plant and Jimmy Page. Fans in Britain, Australia and France adored him even more passionately than those in America. To his managers and record company, Jeff was a shining star, a gateway to prestige, money and credibility. A very great deal was riding on the songs he was testing out on the four-track recorder in the living room of his house in Memphis. Jeff didn't like to think about those pressures, which is partly why he moved 1,000 miles away from New York. Here, he could think, write, create. The drive from Jeff's house to Young Avenue, where the rehearsal room was located, should have taken 10 minutes down a few tree-lined streets. But something was wrong. Before Jeff and Foti knew it, nearly an hour had passed and there was still no sign of the two-storey red-brick building. They found themselves circling around a variety of neighbourhoods, past underpasses for Interstate 240 and pawnshops. To Foti, everything began to look the same. Jeff had an idea. \"Why don't we go down to the river?\" he said. It sounded good to Foti, who had brought along his guitar and felt like practising a song he was writing. Having a talented, well-regarded rock star as an audience wouldn't be so bad, either. The Wolf River did not look particularly wolfish; it barely had the feel of a river. The city government had passed an ordinance banning swimming, but no signs indicated this restriction. According to locals, there didn't have to be, since everyone in Memphis knew it was far from an ideal swimming hole. The first six inches of water could be warm and innocuous-looking, but thanks to the intersection with the Mississippi the undercurrents were deceptive. All day long and into the early hours of the morning, 200ft-long barges carrying goods from the local granaries and a cement factory hauled their cargo up and down the Wolf. With their churning motors, the tugboats that pulled the barges were even fiercer and had been known to create strong wakes. Local coastguard employees had once witnessed a 16ft flat-bottom boat being sucked under the water in the wake of a tug. Memphis lore had it that at least one person a year drowned in the Wolf. Even if Jeff had heard these stories, he either didn't care or disregarded them. Hopping over a 3ft-high brick wall, Jeff and Foti strode across a cement promenade strewn with picnic tables. Then Jeff hiked his black combat boots on to the bottom rung on the steel rail that ran alongside the promenade and jumped over. Foti, gripping his guitar, followed, and they found themselves barrelling down a steep slope, swishing through knee-high brush, ivy and weeds. On the way down, Jeff shed his coat - just dropped it in the brush. \"You're not gonna leave it here, are you?\" Foti asked, stopping quickly to pick it up. Jeff didn't seem to be listening. Carrying Foti's boom box, he continued down to the riverbank. The shore was littered with rocks, soda cans and shattered glass bottles, and it quickly sloped into the water just inches away. As gentle waves lapped on to the shoreline, Jeff set Foti's boom box on one of the many jagged slate rocks on the bank, just an inch or so above the water. \"Hey, man, don't put my radio there,\" Foti told him. \"I don't want it going in the water. It's my only unit of sound.\" Jeff didn't seem to pay particular attention to that request, either. By now, just after 9pm, Foti had strapped on his guitar and started practising his song. Looking right at Foti, Jeff took a step or two away, his back to the river. Before Foti knew it, Jeff was knee-high in the water. \"What are you doin', man?\" Foti said. Within moments, Jeff's entire body eased into the water, and he began doing a backstroke. At first, Foti wasn't too concerned: Jeff was still directly offshore, just a few feet away. He and Foti began musing about life and music as Jeff backstroked around in circles. \"You know, the first one's fun, man - it's that second one ... \" Jeff said, his voice trailing off as he continued to backstroke in the water. With each stroke, Jeff inched more and more out into the river. Foti noticed and said, \"Come in, you're gettin' too far out.\" Instead, Jeff began singing Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love. \"He was just on his own at that point,\" Foti says. \"He didn't really observe my concerns.\" Jeff had an impetuous, spur-of-the-moment streak. Many of his friends considered it one of his most endearing qualities; others worried that it bordered on recklessness. Like his father, he liked to follow his muse, to leap into projects passionately and spontaneously, even if they weren't fashionable or appropriate. Take that night in 1975. Tim was on his way home from a gruelling tour. His record sales were in freefall, but lately he had tried to cut back on his drinking and drugging, and was attempting to get his music and even a potential acting career on track. On the way home from the last stop on his tour, he stopped by the home of a friend, who offered up a few drugs. What was wrong with a little pick-me-up after some exhausting road work? No one knew if Tim realised exactly what he had snorted that late afternoon, but it ultimately didn't matter; he died that night of an overdose at the age of 28. Although Jeff had experimented with drugs, he steered clear to avoid his father's fate, both physically and artistically; he had learned from Tim's mistakes in the matters of artistic integrity and handling the music business. Onstage, Jeff would often make cracks about dead rock stars, pretending to shoot up or breaking into spot-on mimicry of anyone from Jim Morrison to Elvis Presley. Once this new album was completed, he was planning to dig deeper into his family heritage and unearth the truth behind the seemingly ongoing series of tragedies that haunted his lineage. Tonight, as he backstroked in the water, Jeff appeared to feel freer than he had in a while. The mere fact that he was in water was a sign of change. Although he had grown up near the beaches of Southern California, Jeff was never a beachcomber. It was now close to 9.15pm, and Jeff had been in the river nearly 15 minutes. His boots and trousers must gradually have become more sodden and heavy. He began swimming further toward the centre of the river, circling around before drifting to the left of Foti. Then he began swimming straight across to the other side, or so it appeared to Foti. Directly across from them, on the opposite bank, was a dirt road that ran right up from the river. It looked so close - maybe Jeff felt he could reach it and take a quick stroll. The tugboat came first, moments later. \"Jeff, man, there's a boat coming,\" Foti said. \"Get out of the fucking water.\" The boat was heading in their direction, up from Beale Street. Jeff seemed to take notice of it and made sure to be clear of it as it passed. The next time Foti looked over, he still saw Jeff's head bobbing in the water. Not more than a minute had passed when Foti spied another boat approaching. This one was bigger - a barge, perhaps 100ft long. Foti grew more concerned and started yelling louder for Jeff to come back. Once again, Jeff swam out of its path, and Foti breathed another sigh of relief. In the increasing darkness, the speck that was Jeff's head was just barely visible. Soon, the water grew choppy, the waves lapping a little more firmly against the riverbank. Foti grew worried about his boom box. The last thing he wanted was to see it waterlogged and unusable. Taking his eye off Jeff for a moment, he stepped over to where Jeff had set the stereo down on a rock and moved it back about five feet, out of reach of the waves. Foti turned back around. There was no longer a head in the water. There was nothing - just stillness, a few rippling aftershock waves, and the marina in the distance. Foti began to scream out Jeff's name. There was no answer. He yelled more. He continued screaming for nearly 10 minutes. On the other side of the river, Gordon Archibald, a 59-year-old employee of the marina, was walking near the moored boats with a friend when he heard a single shout of \"help\". Concerned, he looked out on to the water. But he saw nothing, nor heard anything more. The folk singer Tim Buckley, who was to become Jeff's father, married Mary Guibert in 1965. It was spring 1966, Mary Guibert was three months pregnant, 18 years old, and Tim was out of town. Even before Tim left for New York, his wife suspected he was spending time with other women. \"By no stretch of the imagination was this a marriage made in heaven,\" she says. \"He hadn't been faithful to me for very long. And I thought that was perfectly acceptable because, after all, he was so wonderful, and I was so nobody.\" Mary says she told Tim about the pregnancy before he left for New York, but that he told her he had to leave town and that she should move back in with her family in Orange County, near LA, get a job, save money, and \"maybe get an abortion or whatever you want to do\", she recalls him saying. Even then, Tim made no mention of another woman. \"I just had no idea,\" Mary says. \"A lot of denial going on. Tons of denial on both sides, because he wouldn't bring himself, to the very end, to say, 'You know, I really don't love you very much'.\" She sent Tim letters to various addresses in New York; his replies came fitfully and were pointedly vague. Finally, a mutual friend gave her the news: Tim was in New York with a new girlfriend, and would be back in Los Angeles shortly. Lee Underwood, guitarist in Buckley's band and a great friend, recalls the situation being a topic of discussion while he and Tim were in New York that summer. Given the choice of returning to Mary and Orange County or following what Underwood calls \"his destined natural way\", Tim \"decided to be true to himself and his music, fully aware that he would be accepting a lifetime burden of guilt. Tim left, not because he didn't care about his soon-to-be-born child but because his musical life was just beginning; in addition, he couldn't stand Mary. He did not abandon Jeff; he abandoned Mary.\" Finally, some action had to be taken. Tim came to meet Mary at a coffee shop near her home. What exactly happened remains unclear. Tim never talked to his friends about it, while Anna Guibert, Mary's mother, recalls Tim giving Mary an ultimatum: divorce or abortion. According to Mary, she asked Tim what they should do about the marriage and pregnancy, and he replied, \"You do whatever you have to do, baby\", and hung his head. Afterwards, Mary, who was by now many months pregnant, walked home, told her mother the news and cried. As Anna Guibert remembers, \"I said, 'That's the best thing, honey. If he doesn't want you, be free.' She was crazy about Tim. But he wanted his career. There was no place for a baby in his life.\"Mary, however, did want her baby. He was born on Thursday, November 17, 1966, at 10.49pm, after 21 hours of labour. The issue of identity loomed even before the child left the hospital. Mary named her son Jeffrey Scott - \"Jeffrey\" after her last high-school boyfriend before Tim (\"my last pure boy-girl relationship, my last pure moment\") and \"Scott\" in honour of John Scott Jr, a neighbour and close friend of the Guiberts who died in an accident at the age of 17. Yet because Mary preferred Scott, the child was instantly called Scotty by his family. Tim was not available for consultation, since no one knew his whereabouts. At school, Scotty was the eternal clown, making jokes, craving attention and being more interested in music (including cello lessons provided by the school) than grades. His second-floor bedroom became a rock enclave, his most valuable possessions being a Hemispheres picture disc by the prog-rock band Rush and all four of Kiss's solo albums. He had a guitar given to him by his grandmother, and although he hadn't learned to master it, he would sit and cradle it, \"like Linus's blanket\", according to Willie Osborn, his childhood friend. Although Jeff had taken his father's name, his music tastes reflected none of Tim's influence. He was just eight years old when Tim died; they had had their only proper encounter just months before. The meeting between Tim and Jeff Buckley, April 1975. Mary Guibert was flipping through a local newspaper when she saw a listing for Tim Buckley's upcoming show. It was, she says, \"an epiphany\". It had been six years since she and her first husband had seen each other, and nearly as long since they had spoken. Mary and Jeff took the hour-long drive to Huntington Beach, an oceanside town 10 miles southwest of Orange County, and arrived at the Golden Bear just before Tim walked on-stage. They took a seat on a bench in the second row. Jeff seemed enraptured, bouncing in his seat to the rhythms of Tim's 12-string guitar and rock band. \"Scotty was in love,\" Mary says. \"He was immediately entranced. His little eyes were just dancing in his head.\" To Mary, Tim was still a dynamic performer, bouncing on his heels with his eyes shut, but she also felt he looked careworn for someone still in his 20s. At the end of the set, no sooner had Mary asked her son if he wanted to meet his father than the kid was out of his seat and scurrying in the direction of the backstage area. As they entered the cramped dressing room, Jeff clutched his mother's long skirt. It seemed a foreign and frightening world to him, until he heard someone shout out, \"Jeff!\" Although no one had called him that before in his life - he was still \"Scotty\" to everyone - Jeff ran across the room to a table where Tim was resting after the show. Tim hoisted his son on to his knees and began rocking him back and forth with a smile as Jeff gave his father a crash course on his life, rattling off his age, the name of his dog, his teachers, his half-brother and other vital statistics. \"I sat on his knees for 15 minutes,\" Jeff wrote later. \"He was hot and sweaty. I kept on feeling his legs. 'Wow, you need an iceberg to cool you off!' I was very embarrassing - doing my George Carlin impression for him for no reason. Very embarrassing. He smiled the whole time. Me too.\" Tim's drummer, Buddy Helm, recalls. \"It was a very personal moment. The kid seemed very genuine, totally in love with his dad. It was like wanting to connect. He didn't know anything personally about Tim but was there ready to do it.\" The same seemed to be true of Tim; after years of distance from his son, he seemed to feel it was time to re-cement whatever bond existed between them. Shortly after, before the second set began, Judy, Tim's new partner, asked Mary if it would be acceptable for Jeff to spend a few days at their place: Tim would be leaving soon on tour, but had some free time. It was the start of the Easter break, so Mary agreed. Next morning, she packed Jeff's clothes in a brown paper bag and drove him to Santa Monica to spend his most extended period of time with his father. Tim and Judy lived a few blocks from the beach. As Jeff remembered it, the following five days - the first week of April 1975 - were largely uneventful. \"Easter vacation came around,\" he wrote in 1990. \"I went over for a week or so, we made small talk at dinner, watched cable TV, he bought me a model airplane on one of our 'outings' ... Nothing much but it was kind of memorable.\" Three years later, he recalled it with much more bitterness: \"He was working in his room, so I didn't even get to talk to him. And that was it.\" Mary recalls Jeff telling her that he would dash into Tim's room every morning and bounce on the bed. At the end of his stay, Tim and Judy put Jeff on a bus out of Santa Monica, and Mary picked him up at the bus station in Fullerton. When Jeff stepped off, she noticed he was clutching a book of matches. On it, Tim had written his phone number. By his teens, Jeff was exhibiting impressive musical skills, as another school band member, drummer Paul Derech, discovered when he visited Jeff in the Guibert home in early 1982. Sitting on his bed, Jeff played songs from Al Di Meola's Electric Rendezvous and the first album by Asia. Even though Derech had to listen closely to Jeff's guitar - Mary couldn't yet afford an amplifier for her son - his dexterity was so apparent that Derech literally took a step back. Once, Jeff pulled out a picture of Tim from his closet and softly said, \"I've spent a lot of time looking at that picture\", before moving on to another topic. Derech, like other kids, sensed immediately that his father was a sore point. Instead, they talked music. Although punk and new wave were the predominant rock styles of the moment, Jeff had little interest in them. He preferred music that challenged him and transported him to imaginary worlds. In the late 70s and early 80s, that music was prog (short for progressive) and art rock - bands such as Yes, Genesis and Rush that revelled in complex structures, science-fiction-themed lyrics and virtuosic, fleet- fingered guitar parts that only a few teenagers could hope to master. In a friend's garage, Jeff and Derech soon began jamming on versions of Rush songs. Jeff declined to sing, though; he told friends and family he wanted to be a guitarist, plain and simple. The reason, some felt, was because he didn't want to be compared to the musician father he barely knew. \"He had exactly the same speaking voice as Tim,\" recalls Tamurlaine, the daughter of Herb Cohen, Tim's one-time manager. She befriended Jeff when he and Mary would visit the Cohen family for dinner. (Cohen and Mary kept in touch after Tim and Mary's break-up.) During those meals, Jeff's vocal and physical resemblance to his father led Cohen often to mistakenly call Jeff \"Tim\". Jeff moved to New York City in 1990. Often sporting his black Hendrix T-shirt, Jeff immediately took to New York, hauling his guitar into the subway to play for change and roaming the streets. \"I talked to him right after he got to New York and he was loving it,\" recalls his friend Tony Marryatt, a fellow student at Musicians Institute in Hollywood. \"He said it was just like a Woody Allen movie.\" To support himself, he took a series of day jobs, from working at an answering service (for actors such as F Murray Abraham and Denzel Washington) to being an assistant at a Banana Republic clothes store.

      "body": "<p><strong>Nick Hornby </strong><br> Writer <br></p> <p> The omission from the Booker shortlist of Zadie Smith's startlingly ambitious, wise, funny and warm White Teeth (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99) was both depressing and baffling - I'm sure I wasn't the only one chanting \"You don't know what you're doing\" at the hapless judges. The best non-fiction book I read was Dave Eggers's wonderful, maddening A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador, \u00a314.99): believe the hype, and the title. There have been two book-length editions of Eggers's extraordinary self-published McSweeney's magazine this year - both of them dazzling, and more intimidatingly imaginative than anything any of the big publishing houses have produced. </p> <p><strong> Richard Dawkins </strong><br> Charles Simonyi Professor at Oxford University and author <br></p> <p>Steve Grand is the creator of what I think is the nearest approach to artificial life so far, and his first book, Creation: Life and How to Make It (Weidenfeld, \u00a318.99) is as interesting as you would expect. But he illuminates more than just the properties of life: his originality extends to matter itself and the very nature of reality. Not since David Deutsch's The Fabric of Reality (Penguin, \u00a38.99) have I encountered such a compelling invitation to think everything out afresh, from the bottom up. </p> <p> <strong>Maureen Lipman</strong><br> Actor and writer <br></p> <p> I have enjoyed my millennium read-in in a very catholic way. I started with Coetzee's Disgrace (Vintage, \u00a36.99), which I read in South Africa and found chilling, sparse and beautifully written. I did Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Bloomsbury, \u00a314.99) in Ireland and scarcely looked up at the scenery, and Barbara Kingsolver's The Prodigal Daughter (Faber, \u00a317.99) had me spellbound on tour. It's a book which features none of my interests, and I was riveted. Perhaps the most pleasure has come from Persephone's enchanting reprints, particularly Winifred Watson's Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (Persephone, see Small Press, page 11), a fairy story set in 1930s London, and the funny, stoic and dashing poetry of Virginia Graham. I had the most fun with Howard Jacobson's The Mighty Walzer (Vintage, \u00a36.99), which achieved the impossible and still leaves a glow whenever I think of it. </p> <p> <strong>Claire Rayner</strong><br> Writer and broadcaster <br></p> <p>I've spent most of my available reading for pleasure time this year going back to old delights, notably Elaine Morgan, published by Souvenir Press. Her Descent of Woman, Scars of Evolution and Falling Apart: The Rise and Decline of Urban Civilisation are as wise, witty and refreshing as they were when I first read them almost 25 years ago. But I did find two new books which I think could be as re-readable a couple of decades hence. Peter Ackroyd's London, the Biography (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a325) fits snugly on my bookshelves alongside Mayhew, H V Morton and Walter Besant. Like them he has an eye for the sheer oddity of London and Londoners, and writes about us with wit and elegance. Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador, \u00a314.99), which deals with the relationship between brothers of very disparate age, is a great read. </p> <p><strong> Posy Simmonds</strong><br> Cartoonist <br> </p> <p>Judith Thurman's Secrets of the Flesh: A Life of Colette (Bloomsbury, \u00a37.99) is an intelligent, witty and sympathetic portrait of the novelist, libertine, sexual dissident and toast of the belle \u00e9poque aesthetes. My other choice is The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde, edited by Merlin Holland and Rupert Hart-Davis (Fourth Estate, \u00a335). I dipped into them, became enthralled and then read them chronologically. Over 1,500 letters, from the trivial to the tragic, are wonderfully enriched by the footnotes, which illuminate the world in which their writer moved. </p> <p> <strong>Ben Okri</strong><br> Novelist <br></p> <p>This year I chaired the first Caine Prize for African Writing and found a wealth of talents. I recommend a general interest in African writing to widen taste and see how other people live, dream, and overcome. The story that won the prize, Leila Aboulela's \"The Museum\", is moving, gentle, ironic, quietly angry and beautifully written. My favourite novel of the year deserves evangelism. Joseph Roth's The Radetsky March (Penguin, \u00a38.99) is that rarest of rare things: a masterwork that is a true joy to read. </p> <p><strong> Edward Bond </strong><br>Playwright <br></p> <p>Our theatre gives its talented young playwrights no chance to develop; instead they create a Theatre of Symptoms. When Sarah Kane's Blasted was staged, the critics attacked it with the panicky rage which is the sign that finally they are writing about something profoundly important. The only contemporary play I wish I'd written, it is revolutionary. The counter-revolution came swiftly: she killed herself. 4.48 Psychosis (Methuen, \u00a36.99) is her suicide note, very personal. But playwrights become as important as she has only if their psyche is public. Neither God nor genes gives us our humanity, we create it through our culture. We have ceased to create: we are dead and kept alive by the life-support machine of our colossal technology. No doubt we will turn it off. 4.48 is a great play: bitterly comic, full of a desire for life. It is also the document of our time. Read it - this suicide note is your obituary. </p> <p><strong> Susie Orbach</strong><br> Therapist and writer <br></p> <p>The giant talent of Philip Roth taking on post-Vietnam America in The Human Stain (Cape, \u00a316.99) is breathtaking. He is so acute and such a fine storyteller that we feel we all have those thoughts and insights in just the sequence he lays out for us. We learn what we have wanted to turn away from and not see. And then a magical new talent: Zadie Smith's White Teeth (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99). Rich, unforced, wonderful. Finally, Rebecca Goldstein's Properties of Light (US, Houghton Mifflin, $23), in which the philosopher novelist takes on the anti-materialism of modern physics. </p> <p><strong> Lewis Wolpert </strong><br>Biologist and writer<br> </p> <p>Suicide is terrible, both for the feelings that lead an individual to kill themselves, and for those who remain behind. Kay Redfield Jamison knows suicide almost too well as she only just survived her own attempt. In Night Falls Fast (Picador, \u00a316.99), she focuses on young adults, for whom it is a major cause of death. Depression is a strong predictor of a suicide attempt and one in five of those with a major depressive disorder will attempt to kill themselves. Better understanding and prevention are major issues. An important, moving and informative book. </p> <p> <strong>Helen Boaden</strong><br> Radio 4 controller <br> </p> <p>Andrew Greig dedicated his novel That Summer (Faber, \u00a39.99) to \"the vanishing generation\" of the second world war, and it's a worthy tribute. It's a love story set against the Battle of Britain: the prose is restrained, the plot uncomplicated but the emotion powerful. Len is a gauche young fighter pilot; Stella, a radar operator, is more middle-class, more sophisticated, more wary. The progress of one critical summer and the sweetly tender way they fall in love is told in their alternating voices. You could say that it's a slight tale about ordinary people, but I found myself thinking about it long after weightier tomes had been put aside. </p> <p> <strong>Jenny Eclair </strong><br>Comedian, novelist <br></p> <p>My favourite book of short stories this year was Jeremy Dyson's Never Trust a Rabbit (Duck Editions, \u00a39.99). Dyson is one of the League of Gentlemen misfits and an all-round clever bloke; it's time people stopped being so suspicious of performer/writers. At the moment I want to be Douglas Coupland. His Miss Wyoming (Flamingo, \u00a35.99) is wonderful stuff: he manages to be wacky without being zany. Next year I might try and read some intellectually challenging books but I get headaches rather easily. En route to the Montreal comedy festival I read Tony Parsons's Man and Boy (HarperCollins, \u00a36.99), which made me gulp and sob. It was funny and sad and marvellously emotionally manipulative. A good cover, too. In Corsica I hugely enjoyed India Knight's My Life on a Plate (Penguin, \u00a35.99), as did my 11-year-old, who guffawed all the way through it. I kicked myself along the beach for not writing it myself. I smell a film deal with this one, the lucky cow. </p> <p><strong> Mike Atherton</strong><br> Cricketer <br> </p> <p> Moth Smoke by Mohsin Hamid (Granta, \u00a39.99) is a Pakistani novel about love, death and heroin abuse in contemporary Lahore. It is essentially about a young Lahorian who gets left behind as his more wealthy friend leaves Pakistan for a western education. On his friend's return, he falls in love with his wife, loses his job and slides into drug abuse and a life of crime. It is brilliantly written and examines the restraints many young and westernised Pakistanis must feel within their strictly religious society. </p> <p><strong> Jonathan Dimbleby </strong><br>Broadcaster <br></p> <p>From Fox Talbot's touching portrait of his wife to a limpid still life by Don McCullin 150 years later, Photogenic (Scriptum Editions, \u00a345) is the chronicle of a fine art. With 300 of the best images culled from the 270,000 owned by the Royal Photographic Society, this visual feast is illuminated by an erudite and entertaining text by Pam Roberts, the curator of the RPS Collection. Arranging her selection by theme - portraiture, social documentary, nature and science, nude and fashion, landscape and architecture - she had this reader spellbound. The pity is that so many of these works are never on show. The RPS (which has just has lost its home in Bath) needs its Tate and its Serota to do for British photography what Sir Nicholas has done for modern art. </p> <p> <strong>Bonnie Greer </strong><br>Writer and critic <br></p> <p>My book of the year is The Total Library: Non-Fiction, 1922-1986 by Jorge Luis Borges (Allen Lane, \u00a320). The surprise here is the vigorous stand that the so-called apolitical Borges takes against machismo, Fascism and anti-Semitism. In this beautifully edited and translated volume there is everything from Lana Turner to Dante, Kafka to King Kong, all of it written in a style which embraces brevity as if it were a religion. No one else encapsulates that sense of lightness, cheerful plagiarism and the idea of circularity quite like he does. The aesthete's aesthete, Borges reminds us that we are what we read, that nothing is new under the sun, and that writing well is the ultimate revolutionary act. </p> <p><strong> Fay Weldon</strong><br> Writer <br> </p> <p> The Real Common Worship, edited by Peter Mullen (Edgeways, \u00a312), is a fascinating compilation of essays comparing and contrasting the form of the Prayer Book since Cranmer's original in 1459 - \"One of the handful of key texts,\" according to Diarmaid MacCulloch, \"which have shaped the sound patterns and speech structures through which billions of the human race communicate with one another.\" And which now, according to some others, is being ruthlessly dumbed down in the shape of the new revised Book of Common Worship to something nearer therapy than liturgy. Does it matter? The contributors think it does, profoundly: readers must make up their own minds. </p> <p><strong> Ian Rickson</strong><br> Artistic director of the Royal Court <br> </p> <p>I have to admit that the book that gripped me most was Thomas Harris's Hannibal (Arrow, \u00a36.99). I found it absolutely compelling. Diane Ackerman's A Natural History of the Senses (Phoenix, \u00a37.99) is a beautiful surprise: a seduction in the art of living sensuously. Finally, I loved the ambition of Zadie Smith's White Teeth (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99). It has a rambling richness that wonderfully evokes London. </p> <p><strong> Charles Kennedy</strong><br> Leader of the Liberal Democrats <br></p> <p>My favourite book was Dick Morris's Behind the Oval Office (Random House, \u00a320), a fascinating fly-on-the-wall account from a former Clinton intimate. It is also a case study of New Labour techniques containing warnings about an over-cynical approach to politics. Al Gore should have read it! </p> <p><strong> Margaret Drabble </strong><br>Writer <br> </p> <p>My book of the year is Lorna Sage's remarkable family memoir, Bad Blood (Fourth Estate, \u00a315.99). It's a vividly remembered, honest, generous, shocking story of a 1950s childhood and a teenage love affair. The tone is perfectly judged. The sociological details are fascinating, and the narrative is compelling. It's a fine transformation of pain into something redeeming - I don't think that's too grand a word. A very moving testament. </p> <p> <strong>Jon Snow </strong><br>Newsreader and reporter <br> </p> <p>In Wherever Green is Worn (Hutchinson, \u00a325) Tim Pat Coogan goes in search of the still vibrant Irish diaspora - the 70m people across the world determined that they are Irish. It's a circumnavigation from Argentina to Zimbabwe, crisscrossed with Coogan's brilliance as historian, wit and storyteller. No small volume, it's a book I had by my bedside for several weeks that enabled me to spend many nights among the inimitable Irish influences in America, Europe and varied parts of Africa and Latin America. </p> <p><strong> Esther Freud </strong><br>Writer <br></p> <p>Maggie O'Farrell's first novel, After You'd Gone (Review, \u00a312.99), had me so gripped I had to feign illness in order to devote myself to it entirely. It's a beautifully constructed story of family history, religion, separation and death, all held together by an unashamedly passionate love story. Helen Simpson's short stories Hey Yeah Right Get a Life (Jonathan Cape, \u00a314.99) detail all the things you try to forget once your children have gone to bed. It's a brilliant, painful, funny and courageous book. </p> <p><strong> Stephen Bayley</strong><br> Design guru <br></p> <p>Life being (usually) more interesting than art, I find I'm reading less and less fiction. This year I've read two enthralling real-life adventure stories, superficially very different but essentially similar. The first is Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99), a smart-aleck journey through the grease traps of the New York restaurant scene by a literary chef. If you need to know how to dry-hump an Ecuadorian commis while marinating quail, this tells you how. It is full of similarly repellent detail and quite unputdownably nasty. Jonathan Raban's Passage to Juneau: A Sea and its Meanings (Picador, \u00a36.99) offers a contrast which tests the borders between the sublime and the ridiculous. I never got on with Raban's fussy earlier stuff, but this book about sailing in the Pacific is a beautifully detailed masterpiece. </p> <p><strong> Lady Antonia Fraser</strong><br> Historian <br></p> <p>Marianne Elliott's The Catholics of Ulster (Allen Lane, \u00a325) turned out to be exactly the book I had always wanted without knowing it. It's a tour de force of scholarship, taking Ulster from prehistoric times up till 1999, and at the same time extremely readable. Almost all the myths I had believed about Ulster and Ireland generally turned out to be untrue. One can't help hoping that the appearance of such a measured and passionate work by a historian born an Ulster Catholic is the harbinger of a positive future for the Six Counties. </p> <p><strong> Oliver James</strong><br> Clinical psychologist <br></p> <p> Guilt by Kalu Singh in the Icon series Ideas in Psychoanalysis (\u00a33.99) is a brilliantly alive popular account of Freud's view of it (one subheading reads \"Can fuck, won't cook: Freud's account of guilt\"). The series editor, Ivan Ward, also produced (with Oscar Zarate) a very lively Introducing Psychoanalysis for Icon. As far as fiction goes, anyone familiar with Edward St Aubyn's Patrick Melrose Trilogy will know that he is our purest living prose stylist. This year's A Clue to the Exit (Chatto, \u00a312.99) showed he is becoming more accomplished in plotting and narrative, to great effect. </p> <p> <strong>Susan Greenfield </strong><br>Scientist <br></p> <p> Angela's Ashes (Flamingo, \u00a36.99) is by far and away the book which has most gripped me this year: the subject matter is riveting. From the outset we know we are to hear of a childhood that was, \"of course, miserable\". However, McCourt's attitude to his mother and father is highly complex and intriguing. I have always been fascinated by the inter-war years as a period which, while social and economic progress was being made, also reflected the anxieties of a world in flux. </p> <p><strong> Ken Wiwa</strong><br> Writer <br> </p> <p>Grudgingly, I have to confess to enjoying the literary oik in Martin Amis, whose memoir Experience (Jonathan Cape, \u00a318) is my book of the year. The Alan B'stard of letters proved that he has few peers when it comes to a bit of intellectual arm-wrestling. His drunken encounter with Salman Rushdie coughed up an unforgettable reference to Rushdie's \"extreme hooded-eye treatment -Salman looked like a falcon staring through a venetian blind\". At the other end of the human testament is a memoir that puts the verbal fights of our literary lions into sobering perspective. Not available in the UK until next year, Nega Mezlekia's Notes from The Hyena's Belly (Picador USA, $24) roams Ethiopia, a country ravaged by drought and the death squads of a communist junta busy slaughter ing its way through 100,000 youths. It is a startlingly humane, wry and often humorous account of a young man who was conscripted into a guerrilla army as a boy and survived brushes with \"reactionary exorcists\" to tell a beautiful, often harrowing but mesmerising tale of a haunting and haunted country. </p> <p><strong> Arnold Wesker</strong><br> Playwright <br> </p> <p>In Theatre@risk (Methuen, \u00a316.99), Michael Kustow argues that theatre is at risk because of the conflict between art and commerce, two disparate, uncomprehending worlds. It is a vivid report from the front line and a crackling collage of performances, critiques, profiles and the testimony of leading theatre makers. What drives Kustow's passion is the relevance to life of what he admires. The best enthrals him; the mean, mediocre and absurd appals. It reads like a mesmerising war report of battles lost, won and gloriously fought; an important book to launch an important debate. </p> <p> <strong>Sue MacGregor </strong><br> Today presenter <br></p> <p>Peter Ackroyd's prodigious account of our great city, London, the Biography (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a325), is hugely entertaining, but almost did him in: soon after he finished it he succumbed to a heart attack. It is not a chronological history but a biography you can dip into at any point. In the tumultuous hubbub that has long been London's background, for instance, he searches for silence: in the 16th century, you could find it after midnight; in the 18th, off the Strand. Now, when Sundays are like any other day, you may have to go to a cemetery in Tower Hamlets. Sample, read, and marvel. </p> <p><strong> Terry Eagleton </strong><br>Professor of English <br></p> <p>Anne Carson is a Montreal poet whose volume Autobiography of Red evoked lavish praise from the critics not long ago. Now she has followed it up with Men in the Off Hours (Cape, \u00a310), a wonderfully bizarre, playful, imaginative collection of poems with a hint of Pound's erudite elusiveness about them. This is an audaciously adventurous book, mixing verse, prose poems and brief learned essays. And amid references to Lazarus, Artaud, Catullus and Mandelstam, the poet's own ego, uniquely enough these days, hardly gets a look in. </p> <p> <strong>Howard Brenton </strong><br>Playwright <br></p> <p>At first glance Mark Z Danielewski's House of Leaves (Anchor, \u00a313) seems bizarre: even James Joyce didn't make pages of print look so weird and wonderful. But don't panic, Danielewski is a master storyteller: his narrator, a bar-room Virgil, leads you on a fantastical descent into a maze of American darkness. Refreshingly, Danielewski recognises no cultural divide: his book is both vibrantly streetwise and learned, with a horror plot Stephen King could weep for underlaid by jokes and a metaphysical intensity that is quite new. The great American novelist of the new century is with us. </p> <p><strong> William Boyd</strong><br> Novelist <br></p> <p>Treat yourself to two exemplary books of poetry: Craig Raine's Collected Poems 1978-1998 (Picador, \u00a320) and Derek Mahon's Collected Poems (Gallery Books, \u00a313.95) are both, in their respective and completely distinctive ways, awesomely impressive. Contemporary poetry doesn't come any better than this: both books are darkly witty and worldly, suffused with a profound and moving humanity, and have a tremendous feel for the resources of language. </p> <p><strong> Deborah Moggach</strong><br> Novelist <br></p> <p>This has been an extraordinary year for London. The city has opened up for us - museums, galleries, atriums - and become a place to explore. Peter Ackroyd's London, the Biography (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a325) is the perfect title to celebrate this new relationship: rich, pungent and vastly informative. I was also impressed by the breadth and scope of Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin , (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99) though it's marred by a cod villain. My favourite novel of all was Disobedience (Doubleday, \u00a312.99) by the superlative Jane Hamilton, about a boy eavesdropping on his mother's affair. It's not quite published yet - I read an early copy - but it should be in the shops soon. </p> <p><strong> Bruce Kent </strong><br>Former CND leader <br></p> <p>Almost by accident I came across the 1946 Penguin edition of Ignazio Silone's Bread and Wine (available in the US from Steerforth Press, $27). Set in the persecution days of Mussolini's Italy, it is the story of two friends, one a Marxist disillusioned with his party and the other a priest disillusioned with his church. This novel still has much to say about the relationship between church and state and about discouraged revolutionaries who have not lost their fire. </p> <p><strong> Michael Grade</strong><br> Company director <br></p> <p>Tom Bower's unauthorised biography, Branson (Fourth Estate, \u00a317.99), was a must-read for me, not least because of my role as a non-executive director of lottery operator Camelot, challenged by Branson's People's Lottery for the next licence. In many ways this book was a much braver undertaking than Bower's previous expos\u00e9 of the then living and litigious Robert Maxwell. With his latest target, Bower turned his considerable investigative skills away from a well-known sinner to a popular saint. Branson was, before this book, an icon, an entrepreneur who could do no wrong in the eyes of an adoring public and press. He has, over 20 years or so, positioned himself as the consumers' David against the corporate Goliaths (British Airways, Coca Cola, Camelot, record industry giants and others). In the process, he has consistently topped readers' polls as their choice to be mayor of London, Prime Minister and anything else editors decide is worthy of a poll. This is the first serious examination of Branson's business methods and his character; Bower clearly came to loathe the man. The book is a shocking read and, as ever, Bower has done his profession a great service by providing the antidote to their years of unquestioning loyalty to the grinning pullover, as Lord King of BA dubbed him. The unanswered question remains, how on earth did the press give the Virgin king such a free ride for so long? This story will run and run, no doubt making the lawyers rich in the due process. I hope there is a sequel, or at least an updated version as soon as the lawsuits are over. </p> <p><strong> Hermione Lee</strong><br> Biographer <br> </p> <p>The great English novelist Penelope Fitzgerald died this year. Her last book, published posthumously, The Means of Escape (Flamingo, \u00a312.95), is a beautiful collection of eight haunting, dark stories of people who mostly can't speak for themselves or get their own way but who sometimes find touching and unexpected consolations. A more boisterous and explicit writer is Lorna Sage, whose Bad Blood (Fourth Estate, \u00a315.99), a quirky and compelling memoir of a 1950s Welsh childhood, is a great success: funny, odd and a fascinating piece of social history. Finally, the huge New Penguin Book of English Verse edited by Paul Keegan (Penguin, \u00a320) is a wonderfully intelligent, adventurous, rich anthology, essential for confirmed and potential poetry addicts alike. </p> <p> <strong>Zadie Smith</strong><br> Novelist <br></p> <p>I had a few favourites this year. Two non-fiction gems, Edward Platt's modern pastoral Leadville (Picador, \u00a39.99) and Martin Amis's lyrical Experience (Cape, \u00a318), made my spring, but in the end it was young American writing that rocked my world: Mark Z Danielewski's House of Leaves (Anchor, \u00a313), Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador, \u00a314.99), and, more than anything else, David Foster Wallace's Brief Interviews with Hideous Men (Abacus, \u00a39.99). Foster Wallace is proving to be the kind of writer I was sort of hoping didn't exist -a visionary, a craftsman, a comedian and as serious as it is possible to be without accidentally writing a religious text. He can do anything with a piece of prose, and it is a humbling experience to see him go to work on what has passed up till now as \"modern fiction\". He's so modern he's in a different time-space continuum from the rest of us. Goddamn him. </p> <p><strong> Richard Eyre</strong><br> Director <br></p> <p>The most memorable novel I've read this year is The Human Stain by Philip Roth (Jonathan Cape, \u00a316.99), in his Nathan Zuckerman alter ego. Based on a true story of a college professor who managed to conceal his racial origins for a lifetime, it's a dizzying ride around the extremes of political hypocrisy (Clinton and Lewinsky) and political correctness. Roth laces passionate descriptive writing and beguiling storytelling with polemic and satire, covering the topics of Vietnam, race, sex, love, learning, politics, poverty and self-knowledge without ever sacrificing narrative momentum. It's moving, compassionate and extremely funny. </p> <p> Read the rest of the books of the year <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bestof2000/story/0,6194,411935,00.html\"> here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nick Hornby Writer The omission from the Booker shortlist of Zadie Smith's startlingly ambitious, wise, funny and warm White Teeth (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99) was both depressing and baffling - I'm sure I wasn't the only one chanting \"You don't know what you're doing\" at the hapless judges. The best non-fiction book I read was Dave Eggers's wonderful, maddening A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador, \u00a314.99): believe the hype, and the title. There have been two book-length editions of Eggers's extraordinary self-published McSweeney's magazine this year - both of them dazzling, and more intimidatingly imaginative than anything any of the big publishing houses have produced. Richard Dawkins Charles Simonyi Professor at Oxford University and author Steve Grand is the creator of what I think is the nearest approach to artificial life so far, and his first book, Creation: Life and How to Make It (Weidenfeld, \u00a318.99) is as interesting as you would expect. But he illuminates more than just the properties of life: his originality extends to matter itself and the very nature of reality. Not since David Deutsch's The Fabric of Reality (Penguin, \u00a38.99) have I encountered such a compelling invitation to think everything out afresh, from the bottom up. Maureen Lipman Actor and writer I have enjoyed my millennium read-in in a very catholic way. I started with Coetzee's Disgrace (Vintage, \u00a36.99), which I read in South Africa and found chilling, sparse and beautifully written. I did Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Bloomsbury, \u00a314.99) in Ireland and scarcely looked up at the scenery, and Barbara Kingsolver's The Prodigal Daughter (Faber, \u00a317.99) had me spellbound on tour. It's a book which features none of my interests, and I was riveted. Perhaps the most pleasure has come from Persephone's enchanting reprints, particularly Winifred Watson's Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (Persephone, see Small Press, page 11), a fairy story set in 1930s London, and the funny, stoic and dashing poetry of Virginia Graham. I had the most fun with Howard Jacobson's The Mighty Walzer (Vintage, \u00a36.99), which achieved the impossible and still leaves a glow whenever I think of it. Claire Rayner Writer and broadcaster I've spent most of my available reading for pleasure time this year going back to old delights, notably Elaine Morgan, published by Souvenir Press. Her Descent of Woman, Scars of Evolution and Falling Apart: The Rise and Decline of Urban Civilisation are as wise, witty and refreshing as they were when I first read them almost 25 years ago. But I did find two new books which I think could be as re-readable a couple of decades hence. Peter Ackroyd's London, the Biography (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a325) fits snugly on my bookshelves alongside Mayhew, H V Morton and Walter Besant. Like them he has an eye for the sheer oddity of London and Londoners, and writes about us with wit and elegance. Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador, \u00a314.99), which deals with the relationship between brothers of very disparate age, is a great read. Posy Simmonds Cartoonist Judith Thurman's Secrets of the Flesh: A Life of Colette (Bloomsbury, \u00a37.99) is an intelligent, witty and sympathetic portrait of the novelist, libertine, sexual dissident and toast of the belle \u00e9poque aesthetes. My other choice is The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde, edited by Merlin Holland and Rupert Hart-Davis (Fourth Estate, \u00a335). I dipped into them, became enthralled and then read them chronologically. Over 1,500 letters, from the trivial to the tragic, are wonderfully enriched by the footnotes, which illuminate the world in which their writer moved. Ben Okri Novelist This year I chaired the first Caine Prize for African Writing and found a wealth of talents. I recommend a general interest in African writing to widen taste and see how other people live, dream, and overcome. The story that won the prize, Leila Aboulela's \"The Museum\", is moving, gentle, ironic, quietly angry and beautifully written. My favourite novel of the year deserves evangelism. Joseph Roth's The Radetsky March (Penguin, \u00a38.99) is that rarest of rare things: a masterwork that is a true joy to read. Edward Bond Playwright Our theatre gives its talented young playwrights no chance to develop; instead they create a Theatre of Symptoms. When Sarah Kane's Blasted was staged, the critics attacked it with the panicky rage which is the sign that finally they are writing about something profoundly important. The only contemporary play I wish I'd written, it is revolutionary. The counter-revolution came swiftly: she killed herself. 4.48 Psychosis (Methuen, \u00a36.99) is her suicide note, very personal. But playwrights become as important as she has only if their psyche is public. Neither God nor genes gives us our humanity, we create it through our culture. We have ceased to create: we are dead and kept alive by the life-support machine of our colossal technology. No doubt we will turn it off. 4.48 is a great play: bitterly comic, full of a desire for life. It is also the document of our time. Read it - this suicide note is your obituary. Susie Orbach Therapist and writer The giant talent of Philip Roth taking on post-Vietnam America in The Human Stain (Cape, \u00a316.99) is breathtaking. He is so acute and such a fine storyteller that we feel we all have those thoughts and insights in just the sequence he lays out for us. We learn what we have wanted to turn away from and not see. And then a magical new talent: Zadie Smith's White Teeth (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99). Rich, unforced, wonderful. Finally, Rebecca Goldstein's Properties of Light (US, Houghton Mifflin, $23), in which the philosopher novelist takes on the anti-materialism of modern physics. Lewis Wolpert Biologist and writer Suicide is terrible, both for the feelings that lead an individual to kill themselves, and for those who remain behind. Kay Redfield Jamison knows suicide almost too well as she only just survived her own attempt. In Night Falls Fast (Picador, \u00a316.99), she focuses on young adults, for whom it is a major cause of death. Depression is a strong predictor of a suicide attempt and one in five of those with a major depressive disorder will attempt to kill themselves. Better understanding and prevention are major issues. An important, moving and informative book. Helen Boaden Radio 4 controller Andrew Greig dedicated his novel That Summer (Faber, \u00a39.99) to \"the vanishing generation\" of the second world war, and it's a worthy tribute. It's a love story set against the Battle of Britain: the prose is restrained, the plot uncomplicated but the emotion powerful. Len is a gauche young fighter pilot; Stella, a radar operator, is more middle-class, more sophisticated, more wary. The progress of one critical summer and the sweetly tender way they fall in love is told in their alternating voices. You could say that it's a slight tale about ordinary people, but I found myself thinking about it long after weightier tomes had been put aside. Jenny Eclair Comedian, novelist My favourite book of short stories this year was Jeremy Dyson's Never Trust a Rabbit (Duck Editions, \u00a39.99). Dyson is one of the League of Gentlemen misfits and an all-round clever bloke; it's time people stopped being so suspicious of performer/writers. At the moment I want to be Douglas Coupland. His Miss Wyoming (Flamingo, \u00a35.99) is wonderful stuff: he manages to be wacky without being zany. Next year I might try and read some intellectually challenging books but I get headaches rather easily. En route to the Montreal comedy festival I read Tony Parsons's Man and Boy (HarperCollins, \u00a36.99), which made me gulp and sob. It was funny and sad and marvellously emotionally manipulative. A good cover, too. In Corsica I hugely enjoyed India Knight's My Life on a Plate (Penguin, \u00a35.99), as did my 11-year-old, who guffawed all the way through it. I kicked myself along the beach for not writing it myself. I smell a film deal with this one, the lucky cow. Mike Atherton Cricketer Moth Smoke by Mohsin Hamid (Granta, \u00a39.99) is a Pakistani novel about love, death and heroin abuse in contemporary Lahore. It is essentially about a young Lahorian who gets left behind as his more wealthy friend leaves Pakistan for a western education. On his friend's return, he falls in love with his wife, loses his job and slides into drug abuse and a life of crime. It is brilliantly written and examines the restraints many young and westernised Pakistanis must feel within their strictly religious society. Jonathan Dimbleby Broadcaster From Fox Talbot's touching portrait of his wife to a limpid still life by Don McCullin 150 years later, Photogenic (Scriptum Editions, \u00a345) is the chronicle of a fine art. With 300 of the best images culled from the 270,000 owned by the Royal Photographic Society, this visual feast is illuminated by an erudite and entertaining text by Pam Roberts, the curator of the RPS Collection. Arranging her selection by theme - portraiture, social documentary, nature and science, nude and fashion, landscape and architecture - she had this reader spellbound. The pity is that so many of these works are never on show. The RPS (which has just has lost its home in Bath) needs its Tate and its Serota to do for British photography what Sir Nicholas has done for modern art. Bonnie Greer Writer and critic My book of the year is The Total Library: Non-Fiction, 1922-1986 by Jorge Luis Borges (Allen Lane, \u00a320). The surprise here is the vigorous stand that the so-called apolitical Borges takes against machismo, Fascism and anti-Semitism. In this beautifully edited and translated volume there is everything from Lana Turner to Dante, Kafka to King Kong, all of it written in a style which embraces brevity as if it were a religion. No one else encapsulates that sense of lightness, cheerful plagiarism and the idea of circularity quite like he does. The aesthete's aesthete, Borges reminds us that we are what we read, that nothing is new under the sun, and that writing well is the ultimate revolutionary act. Fay Weldon Writer The Real Common Worship, edited by Peter Mullen (Edgeways, \u00a312), is a fascinating compilation of essays comparing and contrasting the form of the Prayer Book since Cranmer's original in 1459 - \"One of the handful of key texts,\" according to Diarmaid MacCulloch, \"which have shaped the sound patterns and speech structures through which billions of the human race communicate with one another.\" And which now, according to some others, is being ruthlessly dumbed down in the shape of the new revised Book of Common Worship to something nearer therapy than liturgy. Does it matter? The contributors think it does, profoundly: readers must make up their own minds. Ian Rickson Artistic director of the Royal Court I have to admit that the book that gripped me most was Thomas Harris's Hannibal (Arrow, \u00a36.99). I found it absolutely compelling. Diane Ackerman's A Natural History of the Senses (Phoenix, \u00a37.99) is a beautiful surprise: a seduction in the art of living sensuously. Finally, I loved the ambition of Zadie Smith's White Teeth (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99). It has a rambling richness that wonderfully evokes London. Charles Kennedy Leader of the Liberal Democrats My favourite book was Dick Morris's Behind the Oval Office (Random House, \u00a320), a fascinating fly-on-the-wall account from a former Clinton intimate. It is also a case study of New Labour techniques containing warnings about an over-cynical approach to politics. Al Gore should have read it! Margaret Drabble Writer My book of the year is Lorna Sage's remarkable family memoir, Bad Blood (Fourth Estate, \u00a315.99). It's a vividly remembered, honest, generous, shocking story of a 1950s childhood and a teenage love affair. The tone is perfectly judged. The sociological details are fascinating, and the narrative is compelling. It's a fine transformation of pain into something redeeming - I don't think that's too grand a word. A very moving testament. Jon Snow Newsreader and reporter In Wherever Green is Worn (Hutchinson, \u00a325) Tim Pat Coogan goes in search of the still vibrant Irish diaspora - the 70m people across the world determined that they are Irish. It's a circumnavigation from Argentina to Zimbabwe, crisscrossed with Coogan's brilliance as historian, wit and storyteller. No small volume, it's a book I had by my bedside for several weeks that enabled me to spend many nights among the inimitable Irish influences in America, Europe and varied parts of Africa and Latin America. Esther Freud Writer Maggie O'Farrell's first novel, After You'd Gone (Review, \u00a312.99), had me so gripped I had to feign illness in order to devote myself to it entirely. It's a beautifully constructed story of family history, religion, separation and death, all held together by an unashamedly passionate love story. Helen Simpson's short stories Hey Yeah Right Get a Life (Jonathan Cape, \u00a314.99) detail all the things you try to forget once your children have gone to bed. It's a brilliant, painful, funny and courageous book. Stephen Bayley Design guru Life being (usually) more interesting than art, I find I'm reading less and less fiction. This year I've read two enthralling real-life adventure stories, superficially very different but essentially similar. The first is Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99), a smart-aleck journey through the grease traps of the New York restaurant scene by a literary chef. If you need to know how to dry-hump an Ecuadorian commis while marinating quail, this tells you how. It is full of similarly repellent detail and quite unputdownably nasty. Jonathan Raban's Passage to Juneau: A Sea and its Meanings (Picador, \u00a36.99) offers a contrast which tests the borders between the sublime and the ridiculous. I never got on with Raban's fussy earlier stuff, but this book about sailing in the Pacific is a beautifully detailed masterpiece. Lady Antonia Fraser Historian Marianne Elliott's The Catholics of Ulster (Allen Lane, \u00a325) turned out to be exactly the book I had always wanted without knowing it. It's a tour de force of scholarship, taking Ulster from prehistoric times up till 1999, and at the same time extremely readable. Almost all the myths I had believed about Ulster and Ireland generally turned out to be untrue. One can't help hoping that the appearance of such a measured and passionate work by a historian born an Ulster Catholic is the harbinger of a positive future for the Six Counties. Oliver James Clinical psychologist Guilt by Kalu Singh in the Icon series Ideas in Psychoanalysis (\u00a33.99) is a brilliantly alive popular account of Freud's view of it (one subheading reads \"Can fuck, won't cook: Freud's account of guilt\"). The series editor, Ivan Ward, also produced (with Oscar Zarate) a very lively Introducing Psychoanalysis for Icon. As far as fiction goes, anyone familiar with Edward St Aubyn's Patrick Melrose Trilogy will know that he is our purest living prose stylist. This year's A Clue to the Exit (Chatto, \u00a312.99) showed he is becoming more accomplished in plotting and narrative, to great effect. Susan Greenfield Scientist Angela's Ashes (Flamingo, \u00a36.99) is by far and away the book which has most gripped me this year: the subject matter is riveting. From the outset we know we are to hear of a childhood that was, \"of course, miserable\". However, McCourt's attitude to his mother and father is highly complex and intriguing. I have always been fascinated by the inter-war years as a period which, while social and economic progress was being made, also reflected the anxieties of a world in flux. Ken Wiwa Writer Grudgingly, I have to confess to enjoying the literary oik in Martin Amis, whose memoir Experience (Jonathan Cape, \u00a318) is my book of the year. The Alan B'stard of letters proved that he has few peers when it comes to a bit of intellectual arm-wrestling. His drunken encounter with Salman Rushdie coughed up an unforgettable reference to Rushdie's \"extreme hooded-eye treatment -Salman looked like a falcon staring through a venetian blind\". At the other end of the human testament is a memoir that puts the verbal fights of our literary lions into sobering perspective. Not available in the UK until next year, Nega Mezlekia's Notes from The Hyena's Belly (Picador USA, $24) roams Ethiopia, a country ravaged by drought and the death squads of a communist junta busy slaughter ing its way through 100,000 youths. It is a startlingly humane, wry and often humorous account of a young man who was conscripted into a guerrilla army as a boy and survived brushes with \"reactionary exorcists\" to tell a beautiful, often harrowing but mesmerising tale of a haunting and haunted country. Arnold Wesker Playwright In Theatre@risk (Methuen, \u00a316.99), Michael Kustow argues that theatre is at risk because of the conflict between art and commerce, two disparate, uncomprehending worlds. It is a vivid report from the front line and a crackling collage of performances, critiques, profiles and the testimony of leading theatre makers. What drives Kustow's passion is the relevance to life of what he admires. The best enthrals him; the mean, mediocre and absurd appals. It reads like a mesmerising war report of battles lost, won and gloriously fought; an important book to launch an important debate. Sue MacGregor Today presenter Peter Ackroyd's prodigious account of our great city, London, the Biography (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a325), is hugely entertaining, but almost did him in: soon after he finished it he succumbed to a heart attack. It is not a chronological history but a biography you can dip into at any point. In the tumultuous hubbub that has long been London's background, for instance, he searches for silence: in the 16th century, you could find it after midnight; in the 18th, off the Strand. Now, when Sundays are like any other day, you may have to go to a cemetery in Tower Hamlets. Sample, read, and marvel. Terry Eagleton Professor of English Anne Carson is a Montreal poet whose volume Autobiography of Red evoked lavish praise from the critics not long ago. Now she has followed it up with Men in the Off Hours (Cape, \u00a310), a wonderfully bizarre, playful, imaginative collection of poems with a hint of Pound's erudite elusiveness about them. This is an audaciously adventurous book, mixing verse, prose poems and brief learned essays. And amid references to Lazarus, Artaud, Catullus and Mandelstam, the poet's own ego, uniquely enough these days, hardly gets a look in. Howard Brenton Playwright At first glance Mark Z Danielewski's House of Leaves (Anchor, \u00a313) seems bizarre: even James Joyce didn't make pages of print look so weird and wonderful. But don't panic, Danielewski is a master storyteller: his narrator, a bar-room Virgil, leads you on a fantastical descent into a maze of American darkness. Refreshingly, Danielewski recognises no cultural divide: his book is both vibrantly streetwise and learned, with a horror plot Stephen King could weep for underlaid by jokes and a metaphysical intensity that is quite new. The great American novelist of the new century is with us. William Boyd Novelist Treat yourself to two exemplary books of poetry: Craig Raine's Collected Poems 1978-1998 (Picador, \u00a320) and Derek Mahon's Collected Poems (Gallery Books, \u00a313.95) are both, in their respective and completely distinctive ways, awesomely impressive. Contemporary poetry doesn't come any better than this: both books are darkly witty and worldly, suffused with a profound and moving humanity, and have a tremendous feel for the resources of language. Deborah Moggach Novelist This has been an extraordinary year for London. The city has opened up for us - museums, galleries, atriums - and become a place to explore. Peter Ackroyd's London, the Biography (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a325) is the perfect title to celebrate this new relationship: rich, pungent and vastly informative. I was also impressed by the breadth and scope of Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin , (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99) though it's marred by a cod villain. My favourite novel of all was Disobedience (Doubleday, \u00a312.99) by the superlative Jane Hamilton, about a boy eavesdropping on his mother's affair. It's not quite published yet - I read an early copy - but it should be in the shops soon. Bruce Kent Former CND leader Almost by accident I came across the 1946 Penguin edition of Ignazio Silone's Bread and Wine (available in the US from Steerforth Press, $27). Set in the persecution days of Mussolini's Italy, it is the story of two friends, one a Marxist disillusioned with his party and the other a priest disillusioned with his church. This novel still has much to say about the relationship between church and state and about discouraged revolutionaries who have not lost their fire. Michael Grade Company director Tom Bower's unauthorised biography, Branson (Fourth Estate, \u00a317.99), was a must-read for me, not least because of my role as a non-executive director of lottery operator Camelot, challenged by Branson's People's Lottery for the next licence. In many ways this book was a much braver undertaking than Bower's previous expos\u00e9 of the then living and litigious Robert Maxwell. With his latest target, Bower turned his considerable investigative skills away from a well-known sinner to a popular saint. Branson was, before this book, an icon, an entrepreneur who could do no wrong in the eyes of an adoring public and press. He has, over 20 years or so, positioned himself as the consumers' David against the corporate Goliaths (British Airways, Coca Cola, Camelot, record industry giants and others). In the process, he has consistently topped readers' polls as their choice to be mayor of London, Prime Minister and anything else editors decide is worthy of a poll. This is the first serious examination of Branson's business methods and his character; Bower clearly came to loathe the man. The book is a shocking read and, as ever, Bower has done his profession a great service by providing the antidote to their years of unquestioning loyalty to the grinning pullover, as Lord King of BA dubbed him. The unanswered question remains, how on earth did the press give the Virgin king such a free ride for so long? This story will run and run, no doubt making the lawyers rich in the due process. I hope there is a sequel, or at least an updated version as soon as the lawsuits are over. Hermione Lee Biographer The great English novelist Penelope Fitzgerald died this year. Her last book, published posthumously, The Means of Escape (Flamingo, \u00a312.95), is a beautiful collection of eight haunting, dark stories of people who mostly can't speak for themselves or get their own way but who sometimes find touching and unexpected consolations. A more boisterous and explicit writer is Lorna Sage, whose Bad Blood (Fourth Estate, \u00a315.99), a quirky and compelling memoir of a 1950s Welsh childhood, is a great success: funny, odd and a fascinating piece of social history. Finally, the huge New Penguin Book of English Verse edited by Paul Keegan (Penguin, \u00a320) is a wonderfully intelligent, adventurous, rich anthology, essential for confirmed and potential poetry addicts alike. Zadie Smith Novelist I had a few favourites this year. Two non-fiction gems, Edward Platt's modern pastoral Leadville (Picador, \u00a39.99) and Martin Amis's lyrical Experience (Cape, \u00a318), made my spring, but in the end it was young American writing that rocked my world: Mark Z Danielewski's House of Leaves (Anchor, \u00a313), Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador, \u00a314.99), and, more than anything else, David Foster Wallace's Brief Interviews with Hideous Men (Abacus, \u00a39.99). Foster Wallace is proving to be the kind of writer I was sort of hoping didn't exist -a visionary, a craftsman, a comedian and as serious as it is possible to be without accidentally writing a religious text. He can do anything with a piece of prose, and it is a humbling experience to see him go to work on what has passed up till now as \"modern fiction\". He's so modern he's in a different time-space continuum from the rest of us. Goddamn him. Richard Eyre Director The most memorable novel I've read this year is The Human Stain by Philip Roth (Jonathan Cape, \u00a316.99), in his Nathan Zuckerman alter ego. Based on a true story of a college professor who managed to conceal his racial origins for a lifetime, it's a dizzying ride around the extremes of political hypocrisy (Clinton and Lewinsky) and political correctness. Roth laces passionate descriptive writing and beguiling storytelling with polemic and satire, covering the topics of Vietnam, race, sex, love, learning, politics, poverty and self-knowledge without ever sacrificing narrative momentum. It's moving, compassionate and extremely funny. Read the rest of the books of the year here.",

Cynics might not buy McCall Smith's fulsome praise of old African ways and the \"traditionally built\" Precious Ramotswe, but this is the most entertaining read of the year. Ghostwritten David Mitchell (Sceptre, \u00a36.99) Buy it at BOL Mitchell's book is not quite a novel, but neither is it strictly a short-story collection. It is a chain of interlocking stories of disparate lives in the global village we all now inhabit, whether that means a Chinese mountain or the jazz dives of New Orleans. Fabulously atmospheric and wryly perceptive, it announced the arrival of a huge new talent last year, and was readers' favourite in the Guardian first book award. Read it in anticipation of his next book, out in the spring.",

If you thought you had tired of poetry, then this collection, compendious, judicious and eclectic, will galvanise your appreciation of the canon again. Indeed, its choices are so compellingly well made - that is, all the poems chosen are good - that it almost creates a new canon by itself. One would not have dared hope that an anthology could be so thrilling. I hear that the original selection ran to about 1,700 pages, which the binding machinery was unable to cope with; why not take the poems that didn't make it and publish a 500-page companion volume? Penguin, having taken something of a wobbly course in the past, has got its act together and done some really good stuff this year, particularly in its Modern Classics and Classics lists - an enterprise like this would round off their year nicely. </p> <p>Martin Amis's <strong> Experience</strong> (Jonathan Cape, \u00a318) is the title the book rounder-uppers have praised most this year; I dutifully fall into line behind them.

I have not yet finished it, so if anyone wants to send me a copy for Christmas I would be delighted, as I weary of these furtive occasions - strangely thrilling though they are. </p> <p>Someone did send me a copy of Will Self's <strong> How the Dead Live </strong>(Bloomsbury, \u00a315.99), which is a gripping and extraordinary addition to an already outstanding oeuvre that leaves the competition gasping. It's a return to the very origins of his published fiction, a monumentally expanded gloss on the story \"The North London Book of the Dead\", in which the narrator's mother informs him that the dead do not die, they simply move to another part of London. That was a great joke then; it's now the beginning of his imaginative underworld, the strange folds of London where the dead walk and work. Writers of great genius have to deal with Sheol (to avoid the loaded word \"hell\") at some point, and Self's stab is terrific, mind-blowing and, one suspects, horribly personal; not so much written as torn out of himself. I'm not sure all of its conceits succeed; but then Self's work has always been too big to be constrained by concepts of formal discipline or the imaginative good manners that may keep critics happy but can hobble a writer badly in the execution of his or her duty. </p> <p>It's not eccentric to consider Christopher Hitchens the greatest polemical journalist of his day, and in <strong>No One Left to Lie To</strong> (Verso, \u00a37), he excels himself in his denunciation of the Clintons. Considering who we are about to get as president, it is easy to get misty-eyed about Slick Willy; and he does have the most unusual and commendable virtue of not being that interested in personal gain. But there are many other awful things he has done and hypocrisies he has condoned; the latest edition of this book contains allegations of a particularly startling nature that, if they turn out to be true, will force us to perform a very swift and thorough re-evaluation.

      "body": "<p>Although dusk was in sight, the moist, breezy Memphis air still felt mosquito-muggy inside and outside. It was May 1997 and Jeff Buckley, who had turned 30 about six months earlier, emerged from his bedroom in black jeans, ankle-high black boots, and a white T-shirt with long black sleeves and \"Altamont\" (in honour of the Rolling Stones' anarchic, death-shrouded 1969 concert) inscribed on it. Though officially out of his 20s, he remained a rock'n'roll kid at heart. As he and his tour manager Gene Bowen stood outside on the front porch, Jeff said he was heading out for a while. Generally Bowen would accompany Jeff on expeditions while on tour, but tonight Bowen needed space. Some mattresses would be delivered shortly, and the last thing he needed was Jeff bouncing around the house when they arrived. </p> <p>So, when Jeff told Bowen he would be leaving with Keith Foti, Bowen was mostly relieved. Foti was even more of a character than Jeff was. A fledgling songwriter and musician and a full-time haircutter in New York City, Foti had accompanied Bowen from New York to Memphis in a rented van, the band's gear and instruments crammed in the back. Stocky and wide-faced, with spiky, blue-dyed hair, Foti, who was 23, could have been the star of a Saturday morning cartoon show about a punk rock band. </p> <p>Jeff told Bowen that he and Foti had decided to drive to the rehearsal space the band would be using during the upcoming weeks. Bowen told them to be back at the house by nine to greet the band. Jeff said fine, and he and Foti ambled down the gravel driveway to the van parked in front of the house. </p> <p>Suddenly it dawned on Bowen: did Jeff and Foti know where the rehearsal space was? For non-natives, Memphis's layout can be confusing; it wouldn't be hard to get lost or suddenly find one's self in a dicey part of town. Bowen bolted through the front door, but the van was already gone. Oh, well, he thought, they'll find the building. After all, they had been there just yesterday. </p> <p>Cruising around Memphis in their bright yellow Ryder van, past weathered shacks, barbecue joints, pawnshops and strip malls, Jeff and Foti made for an unusual sight. Foti was in the driver's seat, which was for the best; Jeff was an erratic driver. They cranked one of Foti's mix tapes, and the two of them sang along to the Beatles' I Am The Walrus, John Lennon's Imagine and Jane's Addiction's Three Days. Foti and Jeff both loved Jane's Addiction and its shamanesque, hard-living singer, Perry Farrell. It took Jeff back to the days in the late 80s when he was living and starving in Los Angeles, trying to make a name for himself. </p> <p>It wasn't Jeff's fault that he shared some vocal and physical characteristics with his father and fellow musician, Tim Buckley. Both men had the same sorrowful glances, thick eyebrows and delicate, waifish airs that made women of all ages want to comfort and nurture them. It wasn't Jeff's fault, either, that he inherited Tim's vocal range, five-and-a-half octaves that let Tim's voice spiral from a soft caress into bouts of rapturous, orgasmic sensuality. In the 60s, Tim wrote and sang melodies that blended folk, jazz, art song and R&amp;B; he had a large cult following himself, and some of those songs had been recorded by the likes of Linda Ronstadt and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears. </p> <p>When Jeff had begun writing his own music, he, too, moved in unconventional ways, crafting rhapsodies that changed time signatures and leapt from folkish delicacy to full-throttle metal roar. None of this, he insisted, came from his father's influence. His biggest rock influence and favourite band was, he said, Led Zeppelin. To his friends, Jeff talked about his bootleg of Physical Graffiti out-takes with more affection and fannish enthusiasm than he ever did about the nine albums his father had recorded during the 60s and 70s. </p> <p>Tonight, for once, Tim's ghost was not lurking in the rearview mirror. If anything, Jeff seemed at peace with his father's memory for perhaps the first time in his life. Whenever Jeff had mentioned Tim in the past, it was with flashes of irritation or resignation. He sounded as if he were discussing a far-off celebrity, not a father or even a family member. In a way, Tim was barely either: he and his first wife, Mary Guibert, had separated before Jeff was born, and Jeff had been raised to view Tim's life and music warily. But in the past few months, Jeff seemed to have begun to understand his father's music and, more importantly, his motivations. </p> <p>Jeff's years in Los Angeles hadn't been fruitful, but when he moved to New York in the autumn of 1991, a buzz began building around the skinny, charismatic kid with the big-as-a-cathedral voice and the eclectic repertoire. Many record companies came calling, and he eventually, hesitatingly, put his name on a contract with one of them, Columbia. After an initial EP, an album, Grace, finally appeared in 1994. A brilliant sprawl of a work, the album traversed the musical map, daring listeners to find the common ground that linked its choral pieces, Zeppelin-dipped rock and amorous cabaret. Certainly one of the links was Jeff's voice, an intense and seemingly freewheeling instrument that wasn't afraid to glide from operatic highs and overpowering shrieks to a conversational intimacy. </p> <p>Beyond being simply one of the most moving albums of the 90s, Grace branded Jeff as an actual, hype-be-damned talent for the age. The record business was always eager to promote newcomers in such a manner, but here was someone with both a sense of musical history and seemingly limitless potential. Like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison before him, he appeared to be on the road to a long and commanding career in which even a creative misstep or two would be worth poring over. Comparisons with Tim were inevitable, and a disturbing number of fortysomethings had materialised at Jeff's concerts to ask him about his father. But, much to Jeff's relief, the comparisons had begun to diminish with each passing month. </p> <p>Grace hadn't been the smash hit Columbia would have liked, but worldwide it had sold nearly 750,000 copies, and it was talked up by everyone from Paul McCartney and U2 to Zeppelin's Robert Plant and Jimmy Page. Fans in Britain, Australia and France adored him even more passionately than those in America. To his managers and record company, Jeff was a shining star, a gateway to prestige, money and credibility. A very great deal was riding on the songs he was testing out on the four-track recorder in the living room of his house in Memphis. Jeff didn't like to think about those pressures, which is partly why he moved 1,000 miles away from New York. Here, he could think, write, create. </p> <p>The drive from Jeff's house to Young Avenue, where the rehearsal room was located, should have taken 10 minutes down a few tree-lined streets. But something was wrong. Before Jeff and Foti knew it, nearly an hour had passed and there was still no sign of the two-storey red-brick building. They found themselves circling around a variety of neighbourhoods, past underpasses for Interstate 240 and pawnshops. To Foti, everything began to look the same. </p> <p>Jeff had an idea. \"Why don't we go down to the river?\" he said. It sounded good to Foti, who had brought along his guitar and felt like practising a song he was writing. Having a talented, well-regarded rock star as an audience wouldn't be so bad, either. </p> <p>The Wolf River did not look particularly wolfish; it barely had the feel of a river. The city government had passed an ordinance banning swimming, but no signs indicated this restriction. According to locals, there didn't have to be, since everyone in Memphis knew it was far from an ideal swimming hole. The first six inches of water could be warm and innocuous-looking, but thanks to the intersection with the Mississippi the undercurrents were deceptive. All day long and into the early hours of the morning, 200ft-long barges carrying goods from the local granaries and a cement factory hauled their cargo up and down the Wolf. With their churning motors, the tugboats that pulled the barges were even fiercer and had been known to create strong wakes. Local coastguard employees had once witnessed a 16ft flat-bottom boat being sucked under the water in the wake of a tug. Memphis lore had it that at least one person a year drowned in the Wolf. </p> <p>Even if Jeff had heard these stories, he either didn't care or disregarded them. Hopping over a 3ft-high brick wall, Jeff and Foti strode across a cement promenade strewn with picnic tables. Then Jeff hiked his black combat boots on to the bottom rung on the steel rail that ran alongside the promenade and jumped over. Foti, gripping his guitar, followed, and they found themselves barrelling down a steep slope, swishing through knee-high brush, ivy and weeds. </p> <p>On the way down, Jeff shed his coat - just dropped it in the brush. \"You're not gonna leave it here, are you?\" Foti asked, stopping quickly to pick it up. Jeff didn't seem to be listening. Carrying Foti's boom box, he continued down to the riverbank. The shore was littered with rocks, soda cans and shattered glass bottles, and it quickly sloped into the water just inches away. As gentle waves lapped on to the shoreline, Jeff set Foti's boom box on one of the many jagged slate rocks on the bank, just an inch or so above the water. \"Hey, man, don't put my radio there,\" Foti told him. \"I don't want it going in the water. It's my only unit of sound.\" Jeff didn't seem to pay particular attention to that request, either. </p> <p>By now, just after 9pm, Foti had strapped on his guitar and started practising his song. Looking right at Foti, Jeff took a step or two away, his back to the river. Before Foti knew it, Jeff was knee-high in the water. \"What are you doin', man?\" Foti said. Within moments, Jeff's entire body eased into the water, and he began doing a backstroke. </p> <p>At first, Foti wasn't too concerned: Jeff was still directly offshore, just a few feet away. He and Foti began musing about life and music as Jeff backstroked around in circles. \"You know, the first one's fun, man - it's that second one ... \" Jeff said, his voice trailing off as he continued to backstroke in the water. </p> <p>With each stroke, Jeff inched more and more out into the river. Foti noticed and said, \"Come in, you're gettin' too far out.\" Instead, Jeff began singing Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love. \"He was just on his own at that point,\" Foti says. \"He didn't really observe my concerns.\" Jeff had an impetuous, spur-of-the-moment streak. Many of his friends considered it one of his most endearing qualities; others worried that it bordered on recklessness. Like his father, he liked to follow his muse, to leap into projects passionately and spontaneously, even if they weren't fashionable or appropriate. Take that night in 1975. Tim was on his way home from a gruelling tour. His record sales were in freefall, but lately he had tried to cut back on his drinking and drugging, and was attempting to get his music and even a potential acting career on track. On the way home from the last stop on his tour, he stopped by the home of a friend, who offered up a few drugs. What was wrong with a little pick-me-up after some exhausting road work? No one knew if Tim realised exactly what he had snorted that late afternoon, but it ultimately didn't matter; he died that night of an overdose at the age of 28. </p> <p>Although Jeff had experimented with drugs, he steered clear to avoid his father's fate, both physically and artistically; he had learned from Tim's mistakes in the matters of artistic integrity and handling the music business. Onstage, Jeff would often make cracks about dead rock stars, pretending to shoot up or breaking into spot-on mimicry of anyone from Jim Morrison to Elvis Presley. Once this new album was completed, he was planning to dig deeper into his family heritage and unearth the truth behind the seemingly ongoing series of tragedies that haunted his lineage. </p> <p>Tonight, as he backstroked in the water, Jeff appeared to feel freer than he had in a while. The mere fact that he was in water was a sign of change. Although he had grown up near the beaches of Southern California, Jeff was never a beachcomber. </p> <p>It was now close to 9.15pm, and Jeff had been in the river nearly 15 minutes. His boots and trousers must gradually have become more sodden and heavy. He began swimming further toward the centre of the river, circling around before drifting to the left of Foti. Then he began swimming straight across to the other side, or so it appeared to Foti. Directly across from them, on the opposite bank, was a dirt road that ran right up from the river. It looked so close - maybe Jeff felt he could reach it and take a quick stroll. </p> <p>The tugboat came first, moments later. \"Jeff, man, there's a boat coming,\" Foti said. \"Get out of the fucking water.\" The boat was heading in their direction, up from Beale Street. Jeff seemed to take notice of it and made sure to be clear of it as it passed. The next time Foti looked over, he still saw Jeff's head bobbing in the water. </p> <p>Not more than a minute had passed when Foti spied another boat approaching. This one was bigger - a barge, perhaps 100ft long. Foti grew more concerned and started yelling louder for Jeff to come back. Once again, Jeff swam out of its path, and Foti breathed another sigh of relief. In the increasing darkness, the speck that was Jeff's head was just barely visible. </p> <p>Soon, the water grew choppy, the waves lapping a little more firmly against the riverbank. Foti grew worried about his boom box. The last thing he wanted was to see it waterlogged and unusable. Taking his eye off Jeff for a moment, he stepped over to where Jeff had set the stereo down on a rock and moved it back about five feet, out of reach of the waves. Foti turned back around. There was no longer a head in the water. There was nothing - just stillness, a few rippling aftershock waves, and the marina in the distance. Foti began to scream out Jeff's name. There was no answer. He yelled more. He continued screaming for nearly 10 minutes. </p> <p>On the other side of the river, Gordon Archibald, a 59-year-old employee of the marina, was walking near the moored boats with a friend when he heard a single shout of \"help\". Concerned, he looked out on to the water. But he saw nothing, nor heard anything more. </p> <p> The folk singer Tim Buckley, who was to become Jeff's father, married Mary Guibert in 1965. </p> <p>It was spring 1966, Mary Guibert was three months pregnant, 18 years old, and Tim was out of town. Even before Tim left for New York, his wife suspected he was spending time with other women. \"By no stretch of the imagination was this a marriage made in heaven,\" she says. \"He hadn't been faithful to me for very long. And I thought that was perfectly acceptable because, after all, he was so wonderful, and I was so nobody.\" </p> <p>Mary says she told Tim about the pregnancy before he left for New York, but that he told her he had to leave town and that she should move back in with her family in Orange County, near LA, get a job, save money, and \"maybe get an abortion or whatever you want to do\", she recalls him saying. Even then, Tim made no mention of another woman. \"I just had no idea,\" Mary says. \"A lot of denial going on. Tons of denial on both sides, because he wouldn't bring himself, to the very end, to say, 'You know, I really don't love you very much'.\" She sent Tim letters to various addresses in New York; his replies came fitfully and were pointedly vague. Finally, a mutual friend gave her the news: Tim was in New York with a new girlfriend, and would be back in Los Angeles shortly. </p> <p>Lee Underwood, guitarist in Buckley's band and a great friend, recalls the situation being a topic of discussion while he and Tim were in New York that summer. Given the choice of returning to Mary and Orange County or following what Underwood calls \"his destined natural way\", Tim \"decided to be true to himself and his music, fully aware that he would be accepting a lifetime burden of guilt. Tim left, not because he didn't care about his soon-to-be-born child but because his musical life was just beginning; in addition, he couldn't stand Mary. He did not abandon Jeff; he abandoned Mary.\" </p> <p>Finally, some action had to be taken. Tim came to meet Mary at a coffee shop near her home. What exactly happened remains unclear. Tim never talked to his friends about it, while Anna Guibert, Mary's mother, recalls Tim giving Mary an ultimatum: divorce or abortion. According to Mary, she asked Tim what they should do about the marriage and pregnancy, and he replied, \"You do whatever you have to do, baby\", and hung his head. </p> <p>Afterwards, Mary, who was by now many months pregnant, walked home, told her mother the news and cried. As Anna Guibert remembers, \"I said, 'That's the best thing, honey. If he doesn't want you, be free.' She was crazy about Tim. But he wanted his career. There was no place for a baby in his life.\"Mary, however, did want her baby. </p> <p>He was born on Thursday, November 17, 1966, at 10.49pm, after 21 hours of labour. The issue of identity loomed even before the child left the hospital. Mary named her son Jeffrey Scott - \"Jeffrey\" after her last high-school boyfriend before Tim (\"my last pure boy-girl relationship, my last pure moment\") and \"Scott\" in honour of John Scott Jr, a neighbour and close friend of the Guiberts who died in an accident at the age of 17. Yet because Mary preferred Scott, the child was instantly called Scotty by his family. Tim was not available for consultation, since no one knew his whereabouts. </p> <p>At school, Scotty was the eternal clown, making jokes, craving attention and being more interested in music (including cello lessons provided by the school) than grades. His second-floor bedroom became a rock enclave, his most valuable possessions being a Hemispheres picture disc by the prog-rock band Rush and all four of Kiss's solo albums. </p> <p>He had a guitar given to him by his grandmother, and although he hadn't learned to master it, he would sit and cradle it, \"like Linus's blanket\", according to Willie Osborn, his childhood friend. Although Jeff had taken his father's name, his music tastes reflected none of Tim's influence. He was just eight years old when Tim died; they had had their only proper encounter just months before. </p> <p> The meeting between Tim and Jeff Buckley, April 1975. </p> <p>Mary Guibert was flipping through a local newspaper when she saw a listing for Tim Buckley's upcoming show. It was, she says, \"an epiphany\". It had been six years since she and her first husband had seen each other, and nearly as long since they had spoken. Mary and Jeff took the hour-long drive to Huntington Beach, an oceanside town 10 miles southwest of Orange County, and arrived at the Golden Bear just before Tim walked on-stage. They took a seat on a bench in the second row. </p> <p>Jeff seemed enraptured, bouncing in his seat to the rhythms of Tim's 12-string guitar and rock band. \"Scotty was in love,\" Mary says. \"He was immediately entranced. His little eyes were just dancing in his head.\" To Mary, Tim was still a dynamic performer, bouncing on his heels with his eyes shut, but she also felt he looked careworn for someone still in his 20s. </p> <p>At the end of the set, no sooner had Mary asked her son if he wanted to meet his father than the kid was out of his seat and scurrying in the direction of the backstage area. As they entered the cramped dressing room, Jeff clutched his mother's long skirt. It seemed a foreign and frightening world to him, until he heard someone shout out, \"Jeff!\" Although no one had called him that before in his life - he was still \"Scotty\" to everyone - Jeff ran across the room to a table where Tim was resting after the show. </p> <p>Tim hoisted his son on to his knees and began rocking him back and forth with a smile as Jeff gave his father a crash course on his life, rattling off his age, the name of his dog, his teachers, his half-brother and other vital statistics. \"I sat on his knees for 15 minutes,\" Jeff wrote later. \"He was hot and sweaty. I kept on feeling his legs. 'Wow, you need an iceberg to cool you off!' I was very embarrassing - doing my George Carlin impression for him for no reason. Very embarrassing. He smiled the whole time. Me too.\" </p> <p>Tim's drummer, Buddy Helm, recalls. \"It was a very personal moment. The kid seemed very genuine, totally in love with his dad. It was like wanting to connect. He didn't know anything personally about Tim but was there ready to do it.\" The same seemed to be true of Tim; after years of distance from his son, he seemed to feel it was time to re-cement whatever bond existed between them. </p> <p>Shortly after, before the second set began, Judy, Tim's new partner, asked Mary if it would be acceptable for Jeff to spend a few days at their place: Tim would be leaving soon on tour, but had some free time. It was the start of the Easter break, so Mary agreed. Next morning, she packed Jeff's clothes in a brown paper bag and drove him to Santa Monica to spend his most extended period of time with his father. </p> <p>Tim and Judy lived a few blocks from the beach. As Jeff remembered it, the following five days - the first week of April 1975 - were largely uneventful. \"Easter vacation came around,\" he wrote in 1990. \"I went over for a week or so, we made small talk at dinner, watched cable TV, he bought me a model airplane on one of our 'outings' ... Nothing much but it was kind of memorable.\" Three years later, he recalled it with much more bitterness: \"He was working in his room, so I didn't even get to talk to him. And that was it.\" </p> <p>Mary recalls Jeff telling her that he would dash into Tim's room every morning and bounce on the bed. At the end of his stay, Tim and Judy put Jeff on a bus out of Santa Monica, and Mary picked him up at the bus station in Fullerton. When Jeff stepped off, she noticed he was clutching a book of matches. On it, Tim had written his phone number. </p> <p>By his teens, Jeff was exhibiting impressive musical skills, as another school band member, drummer Paul Derech, discovered when he visited Jeff in the Guibert home in early 1982. Sitting on his bed, Jeff played songs from Al Di Meola's Electric Rendezvous and the first album by Asia. Even though Derech had to listen closely to Jeff's guitar - Mary couldn't yet afford an amplifier for her son - his dexterity was so apparent that Derech literally took a step back. </p> <p>Once, Jeff pulled out a picture of Tim from his closet and softly said, \"I've spent a lot of time looking at that picture\", before moving on to another topic. Derech, like other kids, sensed immediately that his father was a sore point. Instead, they talked music. Although punk and new wave were the predominant rock styles of the moment, Jeff had little interest in them. He preferred music that challenged him and transported him to imaginary worlds. In the late 70s and early 80s, that music was prog (short for progressive) and art rock - bands such as Yes, Genesis and Rush that revelled in complex structures, science-fiction-themed lyrics and virtuosic, fleet- fingered guitar parts that only a few teenagers could hope to master. In a friend's garage, Jeff and Derech soon began jamming on versions of Rush songs. Jeff declined to sing, though; he told friends and family he wanted to be a guitarist, plain and simple. </p> <p>The reason, some felt, was because he didn't want to be compared to the musician father he barely knew. \"He had exactly the same speaking voice as Tim,\" recalls Tamurlaine, the daughter of Herb Cohen, Tim's one-time manager. She befriended Jeff when he and Mary would visit the Cohen family for dinner. (Cohen and Mary kept in touch after Tim and Mary's break-up.) During those meals, Jeff's vocal and physical resemblance to his father led Cohen often to mistakenly call Jeff \"Tim\". </p> <p> Jeff moved to New York City in 1990. </p> <p>Often sporting his black Hendrix T-shirt, Jeff immediately took to New York, hauling his guitar into the subway to play for change and roaming the streets. \"I talked to him right after he got to New York and he was loving it,\" recalls his friend Tony Marryatt, a fellow student at Musicians Institute in Hollywood. \"He said it was just like a Woody Allen movie.\" To support himself, he took a series of day jobs, from working at an answering service (for actors such as F Murray Abraham and Denzel Washington) to being an assistant at a Banana Republic clothes store. </p> <p>Read the second part of Remember me? <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,412000,00.html\"> here</a>.</p> <p> \u00a9 David Browne 2001.

      "bodyText": "Although dusk was in sight, the moist, breezy Memphis air still felt mosquito-muggy inside and outside. It was May 1997 and Jeff Buckley, who had turned 30 about six months earlier, emerged from his bedroom in black jeans, ankle-high black boots, and a white T-shirt with long black sleeves and \"Altamont\" (in honour of the Rolling Stones' anarchic, death-shrouded 1969 concert) inscribed on it. Though officially out of his 20s, he remained a rock'n'roll kid at heart. As he and his tour manager Gene Bowen stood outside on the front porch, Jeff said he was heading out for a while. Generally Bowen would accompany Jeff on expeditions while on tour, but tonight Bowen needed space. Some mattresses would be delivered shortly, and the last thing he needed was Jeff bouncing around the house when they arrived. So, when Jeff told Bowen he would be leaving with Keith Foti, Bowen was mostly relieved. Foti was even more of a character than Jeff was. A fledgling songwriter and musician and a full-time haircutter in New York City, Foti had accompanied Bowen from New York to Memphis in a rented van, the band's gear and instruments crammed in the back. Stocky and wide-faced, with spiky, blue-dyed hair, Foti, who was 23, could have been the star of a Saturday morning cartoon show about a punk rock band. Jeff told Bowen that he and Foti had decided to drive to the rehearsal space the band would be using during the upcoming weeks. Bowen told them to be back at the house by nine to greet the band. Jeff said fine, and he and Foti ambled down the gravel driveway to the van parked in front of the house. Suddenly it dawned on Bowen: did Jeff and Foti know where the rehearsal space was? For non-natives, Memphis's layout can be confusing; it wouldn't be hard to get lost or suddenly find one's self in a dicey part of town. Bowen bolted through the front door, but the van was already gone. Oh, well, he thought, they'll find the building. After all, they had been there just yesterday. Cruising around Memphis in their bright yellow Ryder van, past weathered shacks, barbecue joints, pawnshops and strip malls, Jeff and Foti made for an unusual sight. Foti was in the driver's seat, which was for the best; Jeff was an erratic driver. They cranked one of Foti's mix tapes, and the two of them sang along to the Beatles' I Am The Walrus, John Lennon's Imagine and Jane's Addiction's Three Days. Foti and Jeff both loved Jane's Addiction and its shamanesque, hard-living singer, Perry Farrell. It took Jeff back to the days in the late 80s when he was living and starving in Los Angeles, trying to make a name for himself. It wasn't Jeff's fault that he shared some vocal and physical characteristics with his father and fellow musician, Tim Buckley. Both men had the same sorrowful glances, thick eyebrows and delicate, waifish airs that made women of all ages want to comfort and nurture them. It wasn't Jeff's fault, either, that he inherited Tim's vocal range, five-and-a-half octaves that let Tim's voice spiral from a soft caress into bouts of rapturous, orgasmic sensuality. In the 60s, Tim wrote and sang melodies that blended folk, jazz, art song and R&amp;B; he had a large cult following himself, and some of those songs had been recorded by the likes of Linda Ronstadt and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears. When Jeff had begun writing his own music, he, too, moved in unconventional ways, crafting rhapsodies that changed time signatures and leapt from folkish delicacy to full-throttle metal roar. None of this, he insisted, came from his father's influence. His biggest rock influence and favourite band was, he said, Led Zeppelin. To his friends, Jeff talked about his bootleg of Physical Graffiti out-takes with more affection and fannish enthusiasm than he ever did about the nine albums his father had recorded during the 60s and 70s. Tonight, for once, Tim's ghost was not lurking in the rearview mirror. If anything, Jeff seemed at peace with his father's memory for perhaps the first time in his life. Whenever Jeff had mentioned Tim in the past, it was with flashes of irritation or resignation. He sounded as if he were discussing a far-off celebrity, not a father or even a family member. In a way, Tim was barely either: he and his first wife, Mary Guibert, had separated before Jeff was born, and Jeff had been raised to view Tim's life and music warily. But in the past few months, Jeff seemed to have begun to understand his father's music and, more importantly, his motivations. Jeff's years in Los Angeles hadn't been fruitful, but when he moved to New York in the autumn of 1991, a buzz began building around the skinny, charismatic kid with the big-as-a-cathedral voice and the eclectic repertoire. Many record companies came calling, and he eventually, hesitatingly, put his name on a contract with one of them, Columbia. After an initial EP, an album, Grace, finally appeared in 1994. A brilliant sprawl of a work, the album traversed the musical map, daring listeners to find the common ground that linked its choral pieces, Zeppelin-dipped rock and amorous cabaret. Certainly one of the links was Jeff's voice, an intense and seemingly freewheeling instrument that wasn't afraid to glide from operatic highs and overpowering shrieks to a conversational intimacy. Beyond being simply one of the most moving albums of the 90s, Grace branded Jeff as an actual, hype-be-damned talent for the age. The record business was always eager to promote newcomers in such a manner, but here was someone with both a sense of musical history and seemingly limitless potential. Like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison before him, he appeared to be on the road to a long and commanding career in which even a creative misstep or two would be worth poring over. Comparisons with Tim were inevitable, and a disturbing number of fortysomethings had materialised at Jeff's concerts to ask him about his father. But, much to Jeff's relief, the comparisons had begun to diminish with each passing month. Grace hadn't been the smash hit Columbia would have liked, but worldwide it had sold nearly 750,000 copies, and it was talked up by everyone from Paul McCartney and U2 to Zeppelin's Robert Plant and Jimmy Page. Fans in Britain, Australia and France adored him even more passionately than those in America. To his managers and record company, Jeff was a shining star, a gateway to prestige, money and credibility. A very great deal was riding on the songs he was testing out on the four-track recorder in the living room of his house in Memphis. Jeff didn't like to think about those pressures, which is partly why he moved 1,000 miles away from New York. Here, he could think, write, create. The drive from Jeff's house to Young Avenue, where the rehearsal room was located, should have taken 10 minutes down a few tree-lined streets. But something was wrong. Before Jeff and Foti knew it, nearly an hour had passed and there was still no sign of the two-storey red-brick building. They found themselves circling around a variety of neighbourhoods, past underpasses for Interstate 240 and pawnshops. To Foti, everything began to look the same. Jeff had an idea. \"Why don't we go down to the river?\" he said. It sounded good to Foti, who had brought along his guitar and felt like practising a song he was writing. Having a talented, well-regarded rock star as an audience wouldn't be so bad, either. The Wolf River did not look particularly wolfish; it barely had the feel of a river. The city government had passed an ordinance banning swimming, but no signs indicated this restriction. According to locals, there didn't have to be, since everyone in Memphis knew it was far from an ideal swimming hole. The first six inches of water could be warm and innocuous-looking, but thanks to the intersection with the Mississippi the undercurrents were deceptive. All day long and into the early hours of the morning, 200ft-long barges carrying goods from the local granaries and a cement factory hauled their cargo up and down the Wolf. With their churning motors, the tugboats that pulled the barges were even fiercer and had been known to create strong wakes. Local coastguard employees had once witnessed a 16ft flat-bottom boat being sucked under the water in the wake of a tug. Memphis lore had it that at least one person a year drowned in the Wolf. Even if Jeff had heard these stories, he either didn't care or disregarded them. Hopping over a 3ft-high brick wall, Jeff and Foti strode across a cement promenade strewn with picnic tables. Then Jeff hiked his black combat boots on to the bottom rung on the steel rail that ran alongside the promenade and jumped over. Foti, gripping his guitar, followed, and they found themselves barrelling down a steep slope, swishing through knee-high brush, ivy and weeds. On the way down, Jeff shed his coat - just dropped it in the brush. \"You're not gonna leave it here, are you?\" Foti asked, stopping quickly to pick it up. Jeff didn't seem to be listening. Carrying Foti's boom box, he continued down to the riverbank. The shore was littered with rocks, soda cans and shattered glass bottles, and it quickly sloped into the water just inches away. As gentle waves lapped on to the shoreline, Jeff set Foti's boom box on one of the many jagged slate rocks on the bank, just an inch or so above the water. \"Hey, man, don't put my radio there,\" Foti told him. \"I don't want it going in the water. It's my only unit of sound.\" Jeff didn't seem to pay particular attention to that request, either. By now, just after 9pm, Foti had strapped on his guitar and started practising his song. Looking right at Foti, Jeff took a step or two away, his back to the river. Before Foti knew it, Jeff was knee-high in the water. \"What are you doin', man?\" Foti said. Within moments, Jeff's entire body eased into the water, and he began doing a backstroke. At first, Foti wasn't too concerned: Jeff was still directly offshore, just a few feet away. He and Foti began musing about life and music as Jeff backstroked around in circles. \"You know, the first one's fun, man - it's that second one ... \" Jeff said, his voice trailing off as he continued to backstroke in the water. With each stroke, Jeff inched more and more out into the river. Foti noticed and said, \"Come in, you're gettin' too far out.\" Instead, Jeff began singing Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love. \"He was just on his own at that point,\" Foti says. \"He didn't really observe my concerns.\" Jeff had an impetuous, spur-of-the-moment streak. Many of his friends considered it one of his most endearing qualities; others worried that it bordered on recklessness. Like his father, he liked to follow his muse, to leap into projects passionately and spontaneously, even if they weren't fashionable or appropriate. Take that night in 1975. Tim was on his way home from a gruelling tour. His record sales were in freefall, but lately he had tried to cut back on his drinking and drugging, and was attempting to get his music and even a potential acting career on track. On the way home from the last stop on his tour, he stopped by the home of a friend, who offered up a few drugs. What was wrong with a little pick-me-up after some exhausting road work? No one knew if Tim realised exactly what he had snorted that late afternoon, but it ultimately didn't matter; he died that night of an overdose at the age of 28. Although Jeff had experimented with drugs, he steered clear to avoid his father's fate, both physically and artistically; he had learned from Tim's mistakes in the matters of artistic integrity and handling the music business. Onstage, Jeff would often make cracks about dead rock stars, pretending to shoot up or breaking into spot-on mimicry of anyone from Jim Morrison to Elvis Presley. Once this new album was completed, he was planning to dig deeper into his family heritage and unearth the truth behind the seemingly ongoing series of tragedies that haunted his lineage. Tonight, as he backstroked in the water, Jeff appeared to feel freer than he had in a while. The mere fact that he was in water was a sign of change. Although he had grown up near the beaches of Southern California, Jeff was never a beachcomber. It was now close to 9.15pm, and Jeff had been in the river nearly 15 minutes. His boots and trousers must gradually have become more sodden and heavy. He began swimming further toward the centre of the river, circling around before drifting to the left of Foti. Then he began swimming straight across to the other side, or so it appeared to Foti. Directly across from them, on the opposite bank, was a dirt road that ran right up from the river. It looked so close - maybe Jeff felt he could reach it and take a quick stroll. The tugboat came first, moments later. \"Jeff, man, there's a boat coming,\" Foti said. \"Get out of the fucking water.\" The boat was heading in their direction, up from Beale Street. Jeff seemed to take notice of it and made sure to be clear of it as it passed. The next time Foti looked over, he still saw Jeff's head bobbing in the water. Not more than a minute had passed when Foti spied another boat approaching. This one was bigger - a barge, perhaps 100ft long. Foti grew more concerned and started yelling louder for Jeff to come back. Once again, Jeff swam out of its path, and Foti breathed another sigh of relief. In the increasing darkness, the speck that was Jeff's head was just barely visible. Soon, the water grew choppy, the waves lapping a little more firmly against the riverbank. Foti grew worried about his boom box. The last thing he wanted was to see it waterlogged and unusable. Taking his eye off Jeff for a moment, he stepped over to where Jeff had set the stereo down on a rock and moved it back about five feet, out of reach of the waves. Foti turned back around. There was no longer a head in the water. There was nothing - just stillness, a few rippling aftershock waves, and the marina in the distance. Foti began to scream out Jeff's name. There was no answer. He yelled more. He continued screaming for nearly 10 minutes. On the other side of the river, Gordon Archibald, a 59-year-old employee of the marina, was walking near the moored boats with a friend when he heard a single shout of \"help\". Concerned, he looked out on to the water. But he saw nothing, nor heard anything more. The folk singer Tim Buckley, who was to become Jeff's father, married Mary Guibert in 1965. It was spring 1966, Mary Guibert was three months pregnant, 18 years old, and Tim was out of town. Even before Tim left for New York, his wife suspected he was spending time with other women. \"By no stretch of the imagination was this a marriage made in heaven,\" she says. \"He hadn't been faithful to me for very long. And I thought that was perfectly acceptable because, after all, he was so wonderful, and I was so nobody.\" Mary says she told Tim about the pregnancy before he left for New York, but that he told her he had to leave town and that she should move back in with her family in Orange County, near LA, get a job, save money, and \"maybe get an abortion or whatever you want to do\", she recalls him saying. Even then, Tim made no mention of another woman. \"I just had no idea,\" Mary says. \"A lot of denial going on. Tons of denial on both sides, because he wouldn't bring himself, to the very end, to say, 'You know, I really don't love you very much'.\" She sent Tim letters to various addresses in New York; his replies came fitfully and were pointedly vague. Finally, a mutual friend gave her the news: Tim was in New York with a new girlfriend, and would be back in Los Angeles shortly. Lee Underwood, guitarist in Buckley's band and a great friend, recalls the situation being a topic of discussion while he and Tim were in New York that summer. Given the choice of returning to Mary and Orange County or following what Underwood calls \"his destined natural way\", Tim \"decided to be true to himself and his music, fully aware that he would be accepting a lifetime burden of guilt. Tim left, not because he didn't care about his soon-to-be-born child but because his musical life was just beginning; in addition, he couldn't stand Mary. He did not abandon Jeff; he abandoned Mary.\" Finally, some action had to be taken. Tim came to meet Mary at a coffee shop near her home. What exactly happened remains unclear. Tim never talked to his friends about it, while Anna Guibert, Mary's mother, recalls Tim giving Mary an ultimatum: divorce or abortion. According to Mary, she asked Tim what they should do about the marriage and pregnancy, and he replied, \"You do whatever you have to do, baby\", and hung his head. Afterwards, Mary, who was by now many months pregnant, walked home, told her mother the news and cried. As Anna Guibert remembers, \"I said, 'That's the best thing, honey. If he doesn't want you, be free.' She was crazy about Tim. But he wanted his career. There was no place for a baby in his life.\"Mary, however, did want her baby. He was born on Thursday, November 17, 1966, at 10.49pm, after 21 hours of labour. The issue of identity loomed even before the child left the hospital. Mary named her son Jeffrey Scott - \"Jeffrey\" after her last high-school boyfriend before Tim (\"my last pure boy-girl relationship, my last pure moment\") and \"Scott\" in honour of John Scott Jr, a neighbour and close friend of the Guiberts who died in an accident at the age of 17. Yet because Mary preferred Scott, the child was instantly called Scotty by his family. Tim was not available for consultation, since no one knew his whereabouts. At school, Scotty was the eternal clown, making jokes, craving attention and being more interested in music (including cello lessons provided by the school) than grades. His second-floor bedroom became a rock enclave, his most valuable possessions being a Hemispheres picture disc by the prog-rock band Rush and all four of Kiss's solo albums. He had a guitar given to him by his grandmother, and although he hadn't learned to master it, he would sit and cradle it, \"like Linus's blanket\", according to Willie Osborn, his childhood friend. Although Jeff had taken his father's name, his music tastes reflected none of Tim's influence. He was just eight years old when Tim died; they had had their only proper encounter just months before. The meeting between Tim and Jeff Buckley, April 1975. Mary Guibert was flipping through a local newspaper when she saw a listing for Tim Buckley's upcoming show. It was, she says, \"an epiphany\". It had been six years since she and her first husband had seen each other, and nearly as long since they had spoken. Mary and Jeff took the hour-long drive to Huntington Beach, an oceanside town 10 miles southwest of Orange County, and arrived at the Golden Bear just before Tim walked on-stage. They took a seat on a bench in the second row. Jeff seemed enraptured, bouncing in his seat to the rhythms of Tim's 12-string guitar and rock band. \"Scotty was in love,\" Mary says. \"He was immediately entranced. His little eyes were just dancing in his head.\" To Mary, Tim was still a dynamic performer, bouncing on his heels with his eyes shut, but she also felt he looked careworn for someone still in his 20s. At the end of the set, no sooner had Mary asked her son if he wanted to meet his father than the kid was out of his seat and scurrying in the direction of the backstage area. As they entered the cramped dressing room, Jeff clutched his mother's long skirt. It seemed a foreign and frightening world to him, until he heard someone shout out, \"Jeff!\" Although no one had called him that before in his life - he was still \"Scotty\" to everyone - Jeff ran across the room to a table where Tim was resting after the show. Tim hoisted his son on to his knees and began rocking him back and forth with a smile as Jeff gave his father a crash course on his life, rattling off his age, the name of his dog, his teachers, his half-brother and other vital statistics. \"I sat on his knees for 15 minutes,\" Jeff wrote later. \"He was hot and sweaty. I kept on feeling his legs. 'Wow, you need an iceberg to cool you off!' I was very embarrassing - doing my George Carlin impression for him for no reason. Very embarrassing. He smiled the whole time. Me too.\" Tim's drummer, Buddy Helm, recalls. \"It was a very personal moment. The kid seemed very genuine, totally in love with his dad. It was like wanting to connect. He didn't know anything personally about Tim but was there ready to do it.\" The same seemed to be true of Tim; after years of distance from his son, he seemed to feel it was time to re-cement whatever bond existed between them. Shortly after, before the second set began, Judy, Tim's new partner, asked Mary if it would be acceptable for Jeff to spend a few days at their place: Tim would be leaving soon on tour, but had some free time. It was the start of the Easter break, so Mary agreed. Next morning, she packed Jeff's clothes in a brown paper bag and drove him to Santa Monica to spend his most extended period of time with his father. Tim and Judy lived a few blocks from the beach. As Jeff remembered it, the following five days - the first week of April 1975 - were largely uneventful. \"Easter vacation came around,\" he wrote in 1990. \"I went over for a week or so, we made small talk at dinner, watched cable TV, he bought me a model airplane on one of our 'outings' ... Nothing much but it was kind of memorable.\" Three years later, he recalled it with much more bitterness: \"He was working in his room, so I didn't even get to talk to him. And that was it.\" Mary recalls Jeff telling her that he would dash into Tim's room every morning and bounce on the bed. At the end of his stay, Tim and Judy put Jeff on a bus out of Santa Monica, and Mary picked him up at the bus station in Fullerton. When Jeff stepped off, she noticed he was clutching a book of matches. On it, Tim had written his phone number. By his teens, Jeff was exhibiting impressive musical skills, as another school band member, drummer Paul Derech, discovered when he visited Jeff in the Guibert home in early 1982. Sitting on his bed, Jeff played songs from Al Di Meola's Electric Rendezvous and the first album by Asia. Even though Derech had to listen closely to Jeff's guitar - Mary couldn't yet afford an amplifier for her son - his dexterity was so apparent that Derech literally took a step back. Once, Jeff pulled out a picture of Tim from his closet and softly said, \"I've spent a lot of time looking at that picture\", before moving on to another topic. Derech, like other kids, sensed immediately that his father was a sore point. Instead, they talked music. Although punk and new wave were the predominant rock styles of the moment, Jeff had little interest in them. He preferred music that challenged him and transported him to imaginary worlds. In the late 70s and early 80s, that music was prog (short for progressive) and art rock - bands such as Yes, Genesis and Rush that revelled in complex structures, science-fiction-themed lyrics and virtuosic, fleet- fingered guitar parts that only a few teenagers could hope to master. In a friend's garage, Jeff and Derech soon began jamming on versions of Rush songs. Jeff declined to sing, though; he told friends and family he wanted to be a guitarist, plain and simple. The reason, some felt, was because he didn't want to be compared to the musician father he barely knew. \"He had exactly the same speaking voice as Tim,\" recalls Tamurlaine, the daughter of Herb Cohen, Tim's one-time manager. She befriended Jeff when he and Mary would visit the Cohen family for dinner. (Cohen and Mary kept in touch after Tim and Mary's break-up.) During those meals, Jeff's vocal and physical resemblance to his father led Cohen often to mistakenly call Jeff \"Tim\". Jeff moved to New York City in 1990. Often sporting his black Hendrix T-shirt, Jeff immediately took to New York, hauling his guitar into the subway to play for change and roaming the streets. \"I talked to him right after he got to New York and he was loving it,\" recalls his friend Tony Marryatt, a fellow student at Musicians Institute in Hollywood. \"He said it was just like a Woody Allen movie.\" To support himself, he took a series of day jobs, from working at an answering service (for actors such as F Murray Abraham and Denzel Washington) to being an assistant at a Banana Republic clothes store.

I don't know what that means.\"</p> <p>The same appetite Jeff brought to the arts - absorbing a musician's or writer's body of work - was applied to his search for Tim. When Judy Buckley, Tim's widow, gave him tickets to a concert by the Cocteau Twins, Jeff told a friend he kissed Judy on the mouth - partly, he said, out of appreciation, and partly to feel exactly what Tim had seen in this woman. Even as he attempted to sort out the good, bad and ugly in his family's story, there remained the matter of his own music and career. He made a demo of four songs, which he called the Babylon Dungeon Sessions tape, but had had no response from the record companies, and his lack of a band meant he couldn't perform.</p> <p>Then, early in 1991, Jeff was back on the west coast when the phone rang at the house where he was staying. A woman was calling long-distance, from New York, to tell Jeff about an upcoming concert she was co-ordinating. It was a tribute to his father, and she asked if he would like to attend. </p> <p>No one working on the Greetings From Tim Buckley tribute concert at St Ann's, an arts centre in Brooklyn Heights, had known there was a son. Early on, one of concert organiser Janine Nichols's tasks was to find a publicity photograph of Tim, and she tracked down the name and number of Tim's old manager, Herb Cohen. In his cut-to-the-chase manner, Cohen said he not only had photographs but news: \"You know he has a kid?\" And, he continued, the child was more talented than his father. Nichols didn't think much of the information; offspring of 60s rock stars had begun sprouting up on the fringes of the music business, and most of them inherited their parents' looks but rarely their talent. Nevertheless, she jotted down the kid's name and number; the least they could do was invite him to the concert. </p> <p>Nichols dialled the Los Angeles number, and the first thing she noticed about the voice on the other end of the line was how tiny it sounded. When she told Jeff why she was calling, he was hesitant. He'd never sung his father's music in public, he said, and had spent only a very limited amount of time with Tim. Nichols could tell he was very conflicted, and the faint voice asked for time to think it over. </p> <p>Jeff mulled over the unexpected invitation. He still had ambivalent feelings about the paternal figure he barely recalled, and he had long studiously avoided any public connection to him. Yet something about the idea intrigued him. He called his mother and told her about the call. \"I said, 'Well, what's your purpose? What do you want to get out of it?'\" Mary recalls. \"And he said, 'I always missed not going to the funeral.' I said, 'There you go - there's your reason, you'll pay tribute to your father.' \" At the same time, she warned him to stay away from anyone who approached him about becoming \"the next Tim Buckley\".</p> <p> By the time Nichols called back, about a month before the concert, Jeff had warmed to the idea. Neither of the organisers was sold on the kid's talent. They had listened to the demo tape he had sent and found it noisy. Still, Jeff agreed to come. </p> <p>The tribute concert was part way through when a new group of musicians took the stage. One of them was a long-haired kid wearing a black T-shirt. Danny Fields, Tim's one-time publicist, was in the audience, keeping an eye out for the supposed son. Though Jeff had his back to the audience as he tuned his guitar, the spotlight caught his profile and one cheekbone. \"And I said, 'Whoa - there he is,' \" Fields recalls. \"I didn't have to wonder too hard. It could take your breath away.\" (\"My God,\" Jeff said to a friend after the show, \"I stepped onstage and they backlit it and it was like the fucking Second Coming.\")</p> <p> Jeff, who had billed himself as Jeff Scott Buckley, began strumming rigorously as Gary Lucas, formerly with Captain Beefheart's band, surrounded him with waves of soaring-seagull guitar swoops. It was I Never Asked To Be Your Mountain, Tim's song to Mary and her son. The audience suddenly stopped glancing at their watches. After an hour of esoteric music, here was one of Tim's most recognisable songs, emanating from a very recognisable face and sung in a familiar (if slightly deeper) voice. Just before he went on stage, Jeff had finished writing his own verse for the song: \"My love is the flower that lies among the graves,\" it began, ending with a plea to \"spread my ash along the way\". Anyone familiar with the subject matter of the song knew that this performance was more than a faithful rendition of a 60s oldie. It was a tribute, retort and catharsis all in one. </p> <p>When it was time for a finale, Jeff appeared on stage alone. \"Uhh,\" he started, with a nervous giggle, \"a long time ago, when I was a little kid, my mom sat in a bed and she put this record on. And, uhh, it was like the first song where I ever heard my father's voice. I must have been ... umm ... six. I was bored.\" He chuckled winsomely. \"I was bored. I'm sorry. But you know, what can you expect from a cat who's into Sesame Street at the time?\"</p> <p>Then he began singing Once I Was. Here was Jeff, on stage, singing his father's wistful remembrance of an old affair. Suddenly, before the last chorus, a string broke on his acoustic guitar and Jeff sang the lines, \"Sometimes, I wonder for a while/Do you ever remember me?\" unaccompanied. If that weren't dramatic enough, his voice spiralled up on the last word - \"me\" - like a thin plume of smoke, holding on for a moment before drifting up to the ceiling. He took a quick bow, said \"thanks\", disappeared off stage, and the concert ended. The audience was abuzz. So that was the son. Within a month, four record companies were vying for him. The irony of the situation was not lost on Jeff: after years of avoiding any connection with his late father, he had awakened the interest of the music business as a result of singing Tim's music, and he was being checked out by veteran record executives old enough to remember and admire his father. \"I'm convinced part of the reason I got signed is because of who I am,\" Jeff said in 1993. \"And it makes me sad.

From his birth in 1916 (in the carding room of a cotton mill) until he ran away to London, Woodruff lived in the heart of Blackburn's weaving industry. After Lancashire's dominance in textiles came to an end, his father was thrown out of work. From then on, through the great depression of the 1930s, Woodruff and his family faced a life of brutal poverty ... It's a gripping tale, with sales to date of 18,000 and rising. Prospect Books Allaleigh House, Blackawton, Totnes, Devon TQ9 7DL. Tel: 01803 712269 www.prospectbooks.co.uk Prospect Books was founded by Alan and Jane Davidson in 1979, at the same time as their journal of food history, Petits Propos Culinaires. Since 1993, Prospect Books has been owned by Tom Jaine, but continues to publish only books about cookery, food history and the ethnology of food. It is one of the very few British publishers to specialise in this field, and produces four to eight books a year. One which made a splash this year was Bread &amp; Oil: Majorcan Culture's Last Stand , by Tomas Graves, son of the poet Robert. Best Christmas present on the list is Planting by the Moon: A Gardener's Calendar 2001, a calendar that charts the lunar phase, and makes recommendations for vegetable gardeners for each day through the year; but hurry to order it before stocks run out. Another star book in a wonderful catalogue - see the website for full details - is Laura Mason and Catherine Brown's Traditional Foods of Britain: An Inventory . This repertoire of raw materials (breeds of beef, apples, cobnuts), generic products (cheese, cream, whisky, bacon, buns, breads) and branded goods (Worcester sauce, Colman's mustard) gives a stimulating portrait of Britain's gustatory identity.

My first thought was that he had been hasty with his publication date. Nine pages of ranting anti-royalism swamped me and could have afforded him a whole chapter of major lunacies. However, it would not have chimed with his elegant compilation of the endearing bloomers that are the most attractive feature of his paper. </p> <p>There is a scene in Act 2 of Noel Coward's play Design for Living where a playwright discusses with a friend the reviews of a play of his which has opened on the previous night, and skewers the style and content of various newspapers. The Manchester Guardian (as she then was) is ignored - it's unlikely to have published an overnight review of a West End play in editions that escaped to London back in 1933. </p> <p>Today Coward would certainly have embraced Private Eye 's inspired typo-happy renaming of the paper as the Grauniad. And he would probably have had a go at Michael Billington's penchant for punning, perhaps giving his playwright a line lamenting his play's lack of high seriousness: \"'The play on the whole is decidedly thin' ... My God, they've noticed! I shall write fat plays from now on. Fat plays filled with very fat people.\" In 1933 Coward went on to call his play \"emaciated\"; would he have plumped in Grauniad-speak for \"emancipated\" or \"masticated\"? </p> <p>Soon after the invitation to grace these pages, I learnt that Mr Mayes was to appear with me on Radio 4's Loose Ends. When I introduced him I unconsciously called him Ian Hayes; with an awful symmetry, it turned out that this was how his paper named him when his byline first appeared in its columns. Mr Mayes described himself as a \"readers' editor\", retained to stand between 370 staff plus 2,000 freelances and 1.2m readers as a sort of \"internal ombudsman\" who can't be sacked by the editor. </p> <p>I predict that he will survive. He has a pretty wit and the best deadpan style since Jack Benny. As a favourite he offered: \"The building illustrating Simon Hoggart's Diary was not the Cheltenham Town Hall, as the caption suggested it might be. It was Boots the Chemist's.\" \"Quite close for us,\" he added, sotto voce. </p> <p>Earlier on Loose Ends, Sir Nicholas Henderson had confirmed a story about the politician Ernest Bevin ringing down for dinner while staying at the Waldorf Astoria in New York. \"Just a steak and a bottle of newts,\" he said. The concerned kitchen staff phoned the Embassy for a translation. The unsurprised reply was \"That's right, a steak and a bottle of Nuits St Georges.\" Needless to say, Mayes had a newts correction. \"The Great Crested Newt shown on the front of the Society section on September 30 was, as sober inspection confirms, upside down.\" \"Sober inspection\" is a typical subtle Mayes touch. However, he fails to explain how a newt, Great Crested or not, got into the Society section - or what the egalitarian Grauniad is doing with such a section in the first place. </p> <p>Some corrections are too good to need embellishment: \"Readers of the obituary of Mel Torm\u00e9 in the early editions of June 7 will be glad to hear that his nickname, which appeared as the Velvet Frog, was in fact the Velvet Fog.\" Sometimes a note of weariness enters Mr Mayes's prose. \"We spelt Morecambe, a town in Lancashire, wrong again yesterday. We often do.\" </p> <p>In Grauniad land, poor Joan Heal starred in Grab Me A Gondolier, \"pees\" are \"mushy\" and Devon is identified as Cornwall. \"Readers who thought they saw the same Austin cartoon on page one on successive days yesterday and the day before, did. Sorry about that.\" Shades of the Spectator disclaimer: \"Jeffrey Bernard's column does not appear this week as it bears a remarkable similarity to the one we printed last week.\" Can it have been Billington or a sub-editor who referred to a famous American short-story writer as O'Henry? He certainly can't be fingered for referring, in Act 2 of Giselle, to the \"Queen of the Willies\". </p> <p> The Guardian claims to be the only British paper to offer a daily corrections service. The New York Times has long done it. In his Christmas Cracker 1992, John Julius Norwich cites an exchange between his friend Mary Lutyens and Owen Ketherry - Mr Mayes over the water. The paper corrected Samuel Butler's \"'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have lost at all\", believing it to be a misquotation from Tennyson's In Memoriam (\"never to have loved at all\"). </p> <p>The reply went as follows: \"Dear Mrs Lutyens, thank you for reading our pages so attentively. It is always a pleasure to hear from a well-informed reader although in this case the pleasure is bittersweet ... we do pride ourselves on accuracy, but you know what pride goeth before. It is particularly mortifying to have made an accusation of error which is itself erroneous. We are chagrined, we are contrite and we are genuinely grateful to you for correcting us. PS: we cannot answer your question about the number of readers who spotted the error, because their letters are still pouring in every day.\" </p> <p>There is a note of triumph in one of Mr Mayes's apologies. \"The absence of corrections yesterday was due to a technical hitch, not to any sudden onset of accuracy.\" I am submitting this in longhand. God help us.</p>",

For Hopkins, the festival organiser in \"Beehernz\" sent to a remote Scottish island to tempt a reclusive maestro out of a 40-year silence, the impossibility of understanding or empathy leaves him temporarily stranded.

A group of vain and hopeless painters leave their Paris atelier for a trip to the French Riviera; finding no room for their easels and canvases in the sail lofts and cellars of their hotels, they are reduced to cramming themselves into a shed and sketching each other.

Watergate was like something this Thompson dreamt into existence, coming down one morning from a barking LSD high. But in the quarter of a century since that clammy apotheosis, Thompson has increasingly traded on his totemic reputation. </p> <p>So how did such a relatively minor figure become the recipient of such monumental reams of hagiography? The answer is that like other \"iconic\" figures - Pollock, Lennon, Kerouac - so much hip faith was invested in his countercultural status that the market could not stand an overhaul: so much was riding on the assumed verities that to take away the myth became at some point unthinkable. And unthought is precisely what the HST myth continues to be. </p> <p>The work of some of Thompson's quieter peers - the neurasthenic Joan Didion or the patrician Gore Vidal - can safely be returned to: it has a rich afterlife, because it is good writing which does not depend for 65 per cent of its charge on the writer's \"legendary\" status, as though he were a race horse or a tornado rather than some poor schlub who sits at a keyboard all day. Thompson has become a writer for non-readers - the lad writer par excellence - just as Oliver Reed is the actor for people who distrust actors and George Best is the footballer for people easily bored by football. This is someone who is celebrated for all the extracurricular fuzz; as if everything (baldly self-parodic work, creeping misogyny, gun worship) might be forgiven - celebrated, even! - because Hunter is (whatever this means) a \"survivor\". Like people who limp away from terrorist bombings, say? </p> <p>All that Thompson has \"survived\" - and that barely - is his own stupidity, his determination to wreck a talent that was never sturdy in the first place. Even the myth - Iron John with a hot fax, a white-line Unabomber with columns instead of bombs - doesn't stand up to much analysis. The action man is a couch potato. The yippie is a Magnum-toting reactionary. (This is all he has ever done, in essence: react.) The adrenaline junkie is a sorry, stranded addict. And the writer ... well, the writer has been off form (or \"resting\") for so long that the myth can only be sustained by desperate ploys such as this vastly outsized volume of letters. </p> <p> Fear and Loathing in America is a great doorstop of a book which rises higher than the keyboard I'm currently typing on; fatter than a political fixer's kickback, it kicks off with a surreally respectful foreword by David Halberstam (who you suspect really does know better); a solemn nine-page Editor's Note; and finally an Author's Note (the note is single, and high, and desperate) by HST himself. There's already been one big spring-clean volume of correspondence, and there's an overweening absurdity at work here - like one of those 20-CD box sets by a forgotten 1970s prog-rock band - made all the more absurd by the po-faced faux-academic treatment. </p> <p>Hiding behind the rocky mountain shadow of these 750 pages is something that might have been edited into a more urgent narrative; but unless you're very interested in the minutiae of 70s American politics or the backroom politics of American publishing it is a gargantuan slog to sustain patient interest through the endless \"re: expenses\" and in-house gossip. (Freelancers, though, will find a familiar story here of financial despondency, made comforting by the fact that even a superstar like HST has lived a life measured out in overdue and underwhelming cheques.) </p> <p>It's hard not to conclude that this Big Treatment is designed to disguise the fact that it is a very long time since Thompson wrote anything of interest or value. In the place of actual writing, the HST myth has been farmed out to uncritical biographers, letter-hoarders, editors; we've had the film, the \"rescued\" neophyte novel (The Rum Diary, correctly considered substandard at the time) and the now-annual harvest of ass-kiss profiles by other hacks flown out to Woody Creek to \"do\" the ritual and ritually identical profile of the Great Man. Look at the freak! He shoot gun! He snort drug! He mumble word! He fail deadline! The word \"freak\" - once Thompson's proud self-description (he ran for local office on a \"Freak Power\" ticket) - now has a sad ring; and the HST of 1969 would surely be disgusted by the freak show that the HST of today has let himself become. </p> <p>If his only legacy is an unfortunate one of facile me-columnism, there are frustrating hints of the writer he might have worked to become if he hadn't settled for the softcore life. He could have followed a career trajectory like Tom Wolfe's or Thomas McGaune's, except that he was far more obsessed with the idea of writing great books than he was acquainted with the dismal diurnal reality of actually writing them. His solution was the shortcut chemistry of regular amphetamine (and mescaline and dope and whisky) intake, and the recurring epistolary tone here is one in which he decides he MUST WRITE NOW and write VERY IMPORTANT STUFF and A LOT of it. This was the conveniently handy \"point\" of Gonzo style - no rewrites, just straight synaptic pinball - and is bound up with the crucial self-image of that justifiably paranoid hellion, the \"Outlaw Journalist\". But beyond a certain point Thompson seems to go blind to the possibility that just maybe things look increasingly \"strange\" and \"crazy\" and \"brutal\" because what he is doing to his bloodstream, and his brain, is strange and crazy and brutal. </p> <p>There is an interminable exchange of letters with his editor about a proposed (and never written) book on the \"death of the American dream\". Thompson decides in advance that the dream is indeed dead and despoiled: everything is ugly, corrupt, sick (all the key HST codewords). It is now just a question of filling in the inconvenient blank of the due text, harvesting (or bending) the \"facts\" to fit his comedown vision. It seems no coincidence that most of these proposals/letters are written as the dawn is coming on and the speed is wearing off, the writer confusing his own imminent comedown for a de facto worldview that is writhingly alive and claustrophobic and up-close pore-magnified UGLY. A worldview in which the writer is so carried away with the chemistry of his own limited rhetoric - or the rhetoric of his freefall chemistry - that any putative subject is lost in a chemico-rhetorical spin in which the flex of action is 24-7 valued over any reflective weight; where trips taken are valued far more than texts produced. </p> <p>Thompson has joined the select company of other American authors (Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Kerouac) for whom the critical corpus now far outstrips the published work. Can you spot the crucial difference? That's right: Thompson has got posthumous fame while still alive, and this book has the fitting air of an RIP testament, a retrospective trawl, presented as though Thompson were gone, dead, disparu. Which, in a sense, he is.</p>",

Thompson has become a writer for non-readers - the lad writer par excellence - just as Oliver Reed is the actor for people who distrust actors and George Best is the footballer for people easily bored by football. This is someone who is celebrated for all the extracurricular fuzz; as if everything (baldly self-parodic work, creeping misogyny, gun worship) might be forgiven - celebrated, even! - because Hunter is (whatever this means) a \"survivor\". Like people who limp away from terrorist bombings, say? All that Thompson has \"survived\" - and that barely - is his own stupidity, his determination to wreck a talent that was never sturdy in the first place. Even the myth - Iron John with a hot fax, a white-line Unabomber with columns instead of bombs - doesn't stand up to much analysis. The action man is a couch potato. The yippie is a Magnum-toting reactionary. (This is all he has ever done, in essence: react.) The adrenaline junkie is a sorry, stranded addict. And the writer ... well, the writer has been off form (or \"resting\") for so long that the myth can only be sustained by desperate ploys such as this vastly outsized volume of letters. Fear and Loathing in America is a great doorstop of a book which rises higher than the keyboard I'm currently typing on; fatter than a political fixer's kickback, it kicks off with a surreally respectful foreword by David Halberstam (who you suspect really does know better); a solemn nine-page Editor's Note; and finally an Author's Note (the note is single, and high, and desperate) by HST himself. There's already been one big spring-clean volume of correspondence, and there's an overweening absurdity at work here - like one of those 20-CD box sets by a forgotten 1970s prog-rock band - made all the more absurd by the po-faced faux-academic treatment. Hiding behind the rocky mountain shadow of these 750 pages is something that might have been edited into a more urgent narrative; but unless you're very interested in the minutiae of 70s American politics or the backroom politics of American publishing it is a gargantuan slog to sustain patient interest through the endless \"re: expenses\" and in-house gossip. (Freelancers, though, will find a familiar story here of financial despondency, made comforting by the fact that even a superstar like HST has lived a life measured out in overdue and underwhelming cheques.) It's hard not to conclude that this Big Treatment is designed to disguise the fact that it is a very long time since Thompson wrote anything of interest or value. In the place of actual writing, the HST myth has been farmed out to uncritical biographers, letter-hoarders, editors; we've had the film, the \"rescued\" neophyte novel (The Rum Diary, correctly considered substandard at the time) and the now-annual harvest of ass-kiss profiles by other hacks flown out to Woody Creek to \"do\" the ritual and ritually identical profile of the Great Man. Look at the freak! He shoot gun! He snort drug! He mumble word! He fail deadline! The word \"freak\" - once Thompson's proud self-description (he ran for local office on a \"Freak Power\" ticket) - now has a sad ring; and the HST of 1969 would surely be disgusted by the freak show that the HST of today has let himself become. If his only legacy is an unfortunate one of facile me-columnism, there are frustrating hints of the writer he might have worked to become if he hadn't settled for the softcore life. He could have followed a career trajectory like Tom Wolfe's or Thomas McGaune's, except that he was far more obsessed with the idea of writing great books than he was acquainted with the dismal diurnal reality of actually writing them. His solution was the shortcut chemistry of regular amphetamine (and mescaline and dope and whisky) intake, and the recurring epistolary tone here is one in which he decides he MUST WRITE NOW and write VERY IMPORTANT STUFF and A LOT of it. This was the conveniently handy \"point\" of Gonzo style - no rewrites, just straight synaptic pinball - and is bound up with the crucial self-image of that justifiably paranoid hellion, the \"Outlaw Journalist\". But beyond a certain point Thompson seems to go blind to the possibility that just maybe things look increasingly \"strange\" and \"crazy\" and \"brutal\" because what he is doing to his bloodstream, and his brain, is strange and crazy and brutal. There is an interminable exchange of letters with his editor about a proposed (and never written) book on the \"death of the American dream\". Thompson decides in advance that the dream is indeed dead and despoiled: everything is ugly, corrupt, sick (all the key HST codewords). It is now just a question of filling in the inconvenient blank of the due text, harvesting (or bending) the \"facts\" to fit his comedown vision. It seems no coincidence that most of these proposals/letters are written as the dawn is coming on and the speed is wearing off, the writer confusing his own imminent comedown for a de facto worldview that is writhingly alive and claustrophobic and up-close pore-magnified UGLY. A worldview in which the writer is so carried away with the chemistry of his own limited rhetoric - or the rhetoric of his freefall chemistry - that any putative subject is lost in a chemico-rhetorical spin in which the flex of action is 24-7 valued over any reflective weight; where trips taken are valued far more than texts produced. Thompson has joined the select company of other American authors (Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Kerouac) for whom the critical corpus now far outstrips the published work. Can you spot the crucial difference? That's right: Thompson has got posthumous fame while still alive, and this book has the fitting air of an RIP testament, a retrospective trawl, presented as though Thompson were gone, dead, disparu. Which, in a sense, he is.",

Named after the architect of the Berlin Philharmonie building, the Ensemble is formed of players from the hall's resident orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic. So a performance by the Ensemble gives an audience the opportunity to witness some of the teamwork that makes the Berlin Phil perhaps the best orchestra in the world. </p> <p>A charged atmosphere was established from the very opening of Dvorak's G major string quintet, Op 77.

      "bodyText": "The members of the Scharoun Ensemble play together at least as often as any regular chamber group - the difference is that most of the time there are 60-odd other musicians with them. Named after the architect of the Berlin Philharmonie building, the Ensemble is formed of players from the hall's resident orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic. So a performance by the Ensemble gives an audience the opportunity to witness some of the teamwork that makes the Berlin Phil perhaps the best orchestra in the world. A charged atmosphere was established from the very opening of Dvorak's G major string quintet, Op 77. By adding a double bass to a regular string quartet line-up, Dvorak opened up a new dimension of possibilities. The cello, freed from its obligation to provide the bass line, is able to take up lyrical melodies, as well as to thicken up the texture of accompanying harmonies, and the presence of the bass brings a weight and gravity that can be felt as well as heard.

However, the same factors apply to all policies. </p> <p>Firstly, check if the policy is unit-linked or with-profits. If it is unit-linked, heave a sigh of relief - your money is not at risk. But most Equitable policyholders are in 'with profits' plans, which will see lower future investment returns or a 10% penalty if you switch to another provider. </p> <p>Check also if your policy has a \"guaranteed annuity rate\" promise in it. If it does, you are one of the 90,000 lucky policyholders who are the big winners from the debacle. Under no circumstances will you want to stop the policy or transfer it. But the vast majority of policyholders do not have the GAR. </p> <p>What should they do? The answer, according to financial advisers, largely depends on your age and how far from retirement you are. </p> <p>\u0095 Within five years of retirement: don't switch your fund - taking the 10% penalty is not worth it. It probably also makes sense to continue paying contributions to Equitable. </p> <p>\u0095 Within 5-15 years of retirement; stop paying contributions immediately, and set up an alternative, stakeholder-friendly plan for your new contributions. Take advice on switching the existing fund you have built up; younger savers can more easily take the \"hit\" of the 10% penalty on their fund; older savers may want to leave it where it is. </p> <p>\u0095 More than 15 years to retirement; stop new contributions immediately, set up an alternative, stakeholder-friendly plan for new contributions and switch your existing Equitable savings to the new plan. </p> <p> <strong> Case study </strong> </p> <p> <strong>Younger saver, 20-25 years to retirement</strong> </p> <p> Freelance production editor Rachel Hedley, 37, set up an Equitable with-profits pension in July 1999, paying in \u00a3250 per month. \"I thought I'd got everything sorted out, with a company offering good returns and maximum flexibility. </p> <p>\"Now I don't know whether I should transfer it all, even with the 10% penalty, or wait a couple of years and see what happens.\" </p> <p> Recommendation </p> <p>Alan Stevens, at Portfolio &amp; Pensions Management in Glasgow, says: \"She should not put any more money in to her policy at Equitable, and, as she is still in her 30s, I would recommend Norwich Union, which has a good pre-stakeholder friendly plan and invest the money in its UK Growth fund. I would also be comfortable in transferring the existing savings into the NU plan. </p> <p> <strong> Case study </strong> </p> <p> <strong>Later saver, 13-17 years to retirement</strong> </p> <p> Susan Greenberg, a freelance journalist, took out a with-profits personal pension with Equitable Life four years ago and has paid in a total of \u00a38,000. </p> <p>\"I have never had a great deal of confidence in financial institutions, but now I totally mistrust the whole system. I started my pension late, when I was 40, and this is my big investment which is why I chose what I thought was the safest company. And I chose a with-profits policy which I thought was safer still.\" </p> <p> Recommendation </p> <p>Donna Bradshaw, at Fiona Price &amp; Partners in London, says: \"Don't put any more money in to the Equitable plan and set up a new plan elsewhere; possibly split your money 50/50 between a pension and an ISA. At the moment we quite like Norwich Union, Scottish Equitable and NPI for their pension plans. As regards the existing savings, I'd leave it at Equitable. The company is still solvent and there is no reason to pull out urgently. Let the dust settle; you and your adviser will be able to make a better decision then. </p> <p> <strong> Case study </strong> </p> <p> <strong>Older lump sum investor, 10 years to retirement</strong> </p> <p> Nick Shaw has contributed to an Equitable Life with-profits retirement annuity plan - the pre-1988 version of personal pensions - since 1987 and the fund is now worth around \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>He has a guaranteed annuity on this policy although he was not aware of this until the court cases started, and can draw a pension on this plan at any time between 2006 and 2015. He has other pension policies but Equitable was intended to be his main income source in retirement. </p> <p> Recommendation </p> <p>Richard Craven, of London based HCF Partnership, says: \"Besides the obvious 'don't panic' message - leaving it a few months to see how the land lies is not going to make any difference in this case - Mr Shaw has two obvious advantages over many Equitable policyholders. He has a contract with a guaranteed annuity and he is flexible on his eventual retirement date. </p> <p>\"The guaranteed annuity is very valuable. It could be worth 150% to 200% of the likely rates on other annuities on the day he retires. So any alternative provider's policy would have to grow at between one and a half times and twice the Equitable plan. And that's before counting in the 10% penalty on transfer and the cost of signing up to a new provider. \"But he needs to find out whether the guarantee extends to all contributions or just to the small contractual annual amounts he is already paying. </p> <p>\"If incremental or extra amounts don't count for the guarantee, he should consider maximum Isa contributions instead.\" </p> <p><strong> AVCs</strong><br> </p> <p> Around 1.5m workers are boosting the value of their company pension by making additional voluntary contributions (AVCs), and a fair chunk of them will be paying into plans provided by Equitable Life. </p> <p>Equitable is the UK's biggest provider of AVC top-up pension schemes to 4,000 employers including the National Health Service, BT, the BBC and a number of local authorities. </p> <p>Pensions departments at companies have been deluged with calls from worried staff seeking advice. Some employers have already issued information about what employees should do, and a number have begun the process of selecting a new AVC provider. </p> <p>Most Equitable AVC schemes are with-profits, and people paying into these plans will see their investment returns fall in the future. But if they want to move their accumulated AVC funds to another provider, they will have to pay a 10% penalty. </p> <p>So what should employees do? First of all, wait for the position to become a bit clearer, and check what alternative arrangements your employer may be making. </p> <p> <strong> Case study </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Young worker, paying into AVC plan for past two years</strong> </p> <p> Joseph Adams, 32, is a member of his company pension scheme, plus for the past two years he has paid an extra \u00a350 per month into the Equitable AVC offered by his employer. </p> <p> Recommendation </p> <p>David Wright, at employee benefits consultancy Alexander Forbes Financial Services, believes 90% of people with Equitable AVCs should stop paying in and redirect future contributions to another provider. </p> <p>Those people with only a few years to go until they retire would probably be best advised to leave the built-up money where it is, while younger people, such as Mr Adams, with 10 or more years to go until they retire should \"seriously consider\" paying the penalty and shifting their funds, says Mr Wright. </p> <p> <strong> Case study </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Older AVC payer, close to retirement</strong> </p> <p> Richard Ellis, 61, of Hertfordshire, works for an engineering firm and has been paying into an AVC plan provided by Equitable for about seven years. He is trying to maximise his pension pot by paying in as much as he can. He plans to retire in a year's time. Equitable has said that anyone who takes their retirement benefits at the contractual date will not suffer the 10% penalty. </p> <p> Recommendation </p> <p>Equitable has confirmed that though Mr Ellis is taking early retirement, he will be able to draw his pension in the normal way and won't have to pay a penalty. But Mr Ellis says it is \"a worrying time\" and he is angry about suffering the loss of seven months' worth of bonus. </p> <p>Antony Mattocks-Lewis, at Alexander Forbes, says Mr Ellis should seek financial advice about his options, but it may well be worth him continuing to pay into the Equitable AVC as normal as he is so close to retirement. The alternatives, such as taking out a private top-up policy (known as an FSAVC) probably aren't in his best interests. </p> <p><strong> With-profits bonds</strong><br> </p> <p> With-profits bonds, where you invest a lump sum with a life insurer, are particularly popular with older, more cautious investors. Equitable Life has been a leading provider of these bonds but its revised investment strategy, where it will be investing less in stocks and shares, doesn't bode well for the future. Chartwell Investment Management, a Bath-based IFA, says the performance \"is undoubtedly going to suffer\". </p> <p>There is a get out of jail free card - but some people won't be able to use it for quite a while. Equitable has confirmed that with older bonds, there will be no 10% penalty if they are cashed in on the fifth anniversary of the date of purchase, and at each anniversary after that. Unfortunately, those people with bonds taken out more recently have to wait 10 years from the date of purchase until there is no penalty for cashing in. </p> <p>All bond-holders should check their documentation or contact the company to find out their position. </p> <p> <strong> Case study </strong> </p> <p> <strong>Invested \u00a310,000 in with-profits bond nine years ago</strong> </p> <p> Bernard Rogers (not his real name), a client of Chartwell, took out an Equitable with-profits bond in April 1991, putting in \u00a310,000. He didn't put any more in, and has been taking an income from it. </p> <p> Recommendation </p> <p>Mr Rogers' initial reaction was that he wanted to surrender the bond immediately, but Craig Wetton at Chartwell says his advice would be to stay put for the moment and then get out in April next year, when he can cash in the bond without penalty because it is the 10th anniversary. However, Mr Rogers will still be hit with an income tax bill. </p> <p><strong> Income drawdown</strong><br> </p> <p> Income drawdown is one of the most complex areas of pension planning. At retirement people can choose either a conventional annuity, a with-profits annuity or defer buying an annuity by putting their pension pot into an \"income drawdown\" product which leaves the money invested in shares but lets you take a regular retirement income. </p> <p>The bald truth is that, for now at least, there is nothing an income drawdown holder can do. The inland revenue-framed rules for drawdown products currently forbid transfers to other providers. So for the time being, drawdown holders must live with the lower investment returns that Equitable is forecasting. </p> <p>But relief is at hand. Next April it is expected that the transfer rules will be lifted. However, it is currently unclear as to whether Equitable will charge a 10% penalty on drawdown transfers when they are legalised. </p> <p> <strong> Case study </strong> </p> <p> <strong>Recently retired, took out drawdown with \u00a3329,000 in pension savings</strong> </p> <p> Mike Waller, 59, a former engineer, retired last year and used his lifetime pension savings of \u00a3329,000 to buy an Equitable income drawdown plan, from which he takes an income of about \u00a320,000 a year. </p> <p>\"I wasn't that well-versed in the ways of the City, but Equitable seemed a safe and reliable option. I think the House of Lords ruling on the guaranteed annuities was perverse and it has now landed everybody in the situation we are in today. I think the best thing I should do is sit tight.\" </p> <p> Recommendation </p> <p>Russ Devin, at Epsom-based advisers Morgan Nevill, says: \"From April 2001 he can choose another provider. If Equitable does not apply a penalty, he should jump ship straight away. If there is a penalty, what will drive it is his attitude to Equitable. Many people will just want out because of its problems and poor publicity. However, Mr Waller is taking a cautious level of income, and it may make sense to stay with Equitable for a couple of years and then review the situation. </p> <p>But Alan Stevens, of Portfolio &amp; Pensions Management, says Mr Waller was unwise to take the Equitable plan and thinks a transfer, once allowed, should be seriously considered. He would recommend a self-invested drawdown plan split across several funds and companies. </p> <p><strong> With-profits annuity</strong><br> </p> <p> With-profits annuities work by leaving the money invested in a with-profits fund, made up of equities, bonds and property. The person taking out the annuity opts for a level of income from their investment, and each year the company awards a bonus, depending on how underlying investments have performed. </p> <p>Equitable's 65,000 with-profits annuity holders are in the worst position of all - once you have taken out an annuity you can cannot transfer out of it or surrender it and it is the with-profits customers who will effectively be paying for the guarantees with the company issued to its guaranteed annuity customers. </p> <p> <strong> Case study </strong></p> <p><strong>Semi-retired annuity buyer</strong> </p> <p> Peter Ransley, a freelance writer for television, invested almost \u00a3500,000 in an Equitable Life with-profits annuity policy in 1997. It has been paying him an annual income of more than \u00a340,000 since then \"and I had been happy with the performance,\" he says. </p> <p> Recommendation </p> <p>Unfortunately, Mr Ransley cannot switch. Equitable Life is predicting that his income may fall by up to 1% following the switch into gilts, but others, including Mr Ransley, think this is a best-case scenario. </p> <p>\"The Doomsday scenario is that in the long run my income will fall by up to 30%. I had put this together for my wife and now I accept she will be very seriously hit,\" he says. </p> <p>Marlene Shalton, director of advisers Chambers Morgan Jones in Cardiff, says: \"This is a big problem as those with a with-profits annuity do not even have the option to pay the 10% penalty and transfer. Equitable Life should offer some other option to people in this situation.\" </p>",

Under no circumstances will you want to stop the policy or transfer it. But the vast majority of policyholders do not have the GAR. What should they do? The answer, according to financial advisers, largely depends on your age and how far from retirement you are. \u0095 Within five years of retirement: don't switch your fund - taking the 10% penalty is not worth it. It probably also makes sense to continue paying contributions to Equitable. \u0095 Within 5-15 years of retirement; stop paying contributions immediately, and set up an alternative, stakeholder-friendly plan for your new contributions. Take advice on switching the existing fund you have built up; younger savers can more easily take the \"hit\" of the 10% penalty on their fund; older savers may want to leave it where it is. \u0095 More than 15 years to retirement; stop new contributions immediately, set up an alternative, stakeholder-friendly plan for new contributions and switch your existing Equitable savings to the new plan. Case study Younger saver, 20-25 years to retirement Freelance production editor Rachel Hedley, 37, set up an Equitable with-profits pension in July 1999, paying in \u00a3250 per month. \"I thought I'd got everything sorted out, with a company offering good returns and maximum flexibility. \"Now I don't know whether I should transfer it all, even with the 10% penalty, or wait a couple of years and see what happens.\" Recommendation Alan Stevens, at Portfolio &amp; Pensions Management in Glasgow, says: \"She should not put any more money in to her policy at Equitable, and, as she is still in her 30s, I would recommend Norwich Union, which has a good pre-stakeholder friendly plan and invest the money in its UK Growth fund. I would also be comfortable in transferring the existing savings into the NU plan. Case study Later saver, 13-17 years to retirement Susan Greenberg, a freelance journalist, took out a with-profits personal pension with Equitable Life four years ago and has paid in a total of \u00a38,000. \"I have never had a great deal of confidence in financial institutions, but now I totally mistrust the whole system. I started my pension late, when I was 40, and this is my big investment which is why I chose what I thought was the safest company. And I chose a with-profits policy which I thought was safer still.\" Recommendation Donna Bradshaw, at Fiona Price &amp; Partners in London, says: \"Don't put any more money in to the Equitable plan and set up a new plan elsewhere; possibly split your money 50/50 between a pension and an ISA. At the moment we quite like Norwich Union, Scottish Equitable and NPI for their pension plans. As regards the existing savings, I'd leave it at Equitable. The company is still solvent and there is no reason to pull out urgently. Let the dust settle; you and your adviser will be able to make a better decision then. Case study Older lump sum investor, 10 years to retirement Nick Shaw has contributed to an Equitable Life with-profits retirement annuity plan - the pre-1988 version of personal pensions - since 1987 and the fund is now worth around \u00a3100,000. He has a guaranteed annuity on this policy although he was not aware of this until the court cases started, and can draw a pension on this plan at any time between 2006 and 2015. He has other pension policies but Equitable was intended to be his main income source in retirement. Recommendation Richard Craven, of London based HCF Partnership, says: \"Besides the obvious 'don't panic' message - leaving it a few months to see how the land lies is not going to make any difference in this case - Mr Shaw has two obvious advantages over many Equitable policyholders. He has a contract with a guaranteed annuity and he is flexible on his eventual retirement date. \"The guaranteed annuity is very valuable. It could be worth 150% to 200% of the likely rates on other annuities on the day he retires. So any alternative provider's policy would have to grow at between one and a half times and twice the Equitable plan. And that's before counting in the 10% penalty on transfer and the cost of signing up to a new provider. \"But he needs to find out whether the guarantee extends to all contributions or just to the small contractual annual amounts he is already paying. \"If incremental or extra amounts don't count for the guarantee, he should consider maximum Isa contributions instead.\" AVCs Around 1.5m workers are boosting the value of their company pension by making additional voluntary contributions (AVCs), and a fair chunk of them will be paying into plans provided by Equitable Life. Equitable is the UK's biggest provider of AVC top-up pension schemes to 4,000 employers including the National Health Service, BT, the BBC and a number of local authorities. Pensions departments at companies have been deluged with calls from worried staff seeking advice. Some employers have already issued information about what employees should do, and a number have begun the process of selecting a new AVC provider. Most Equitable AVC schemes are with-profits, and people paying into these plans will see their investment returns fall in the future. But if they want to move their accumulated AVC funds to another provider, they will have to pay a 10% penalty. So what should employees do? First of all, wait for the position to become a bit clearer, and check what alternative arrangements your employer may be making. Case study Young worker, paying into AVC plan for past two years Joseph Adams, 32, is a member of his company pension scheme, plus for the past two years he has paid an extra \u00a350 per month into the Equitable AVC offered by his employer. Recommendation David Wright, at employee benefits consultancy Alexander Forbes Financial Services, believes 90% of people with Equitable AVCs should stop paying in and redirect future contributions to another provider. Those people with only a few years to go until they retire would probably be best advised to leave the built-up money where it is, while younger people, such as Mr Adams, with 10 or more years to go until they retire should \"seriously consider\" paying the penalty and shifting their funds, says Mr Wright. Case study Older AVC payer, close to retirement Richard Ellis, 61, of Hertfordshire, works for an engineering firm and has been paying into an AVC plan provided by Equitable for about seven years. He is trying to maximise his pension pot by paying in as much as he can. He plans to retire in a year's time. Equitable has said that anyone who takes their retirement benefits at the contractual date will not suffer the 10% penalty. Recommendation Equitable has confirmed that though Mr Ellis is taking early retirement, he will be able to draw his pension in the normal way and won't have to pay a penalty. But Mr Ellis says it is \"a worrying time\" and he is angry about suffering the loss of seven months' worth of bonus. Antony Mattocks-Lewis, at Alexander Forbes, says Mr Ellis should seek financial advice about his options, but it may well be worth him continuing to pay into the Equitable AVC as normal as he is so close to retirement. The alternatives, such as taking out a private top-up policy (known as an FSAVC) probably aren't in his best interests. With-profits bonds With-profits bonds, where you invest a lump sum with a life insurer, are particularly popular with older, more cautious investors. Equitable Life has been a leading provider of these bonds but its revised investment strategy, where it will be investing less in stocks and shares, doesn't bode well for the future. Chartwell Investment Management, a Bath-based IFA, says the performance \"is undoubtedly going to suffer\". There is a get out of jail free card - but some people won't be able to use it for quite a while. Equitable has confirmed that with older bonds, there will be no 10% penalty if they are cashed in on the fifth anniversary of the date of purchase, and at each anniversary after that. Unfortunately, those people with bonds taken out more recently have to wait 10 years from the date of purchase until there is no penalty for cashing in. All bond-holders should check their documentation or contact the company to find out their position. Case study Invested \u00a310,000 in with-profits bond nine years ago Bernard Rogers (not his real name), a client of Chartwell, took out an Equitable with-profits bond in April 1991, putting in \u00a310,000. He didn't put any more in, and has been taking an income from it. Recommendation Mr Rogers' initial reaction was that he wanted to surrender the bond immediately, but Craig Wetton at Chartwell says his advice would be to stay put for the moment and then get out in April next year, when he can cash in the bond without penalty because it is the 10th anniversary. However, Mr Rogers will still be hit with an income tax bill. Income drawdown Income drawdown is one of the most complex areas of pension planning. At retirement people can choose either a conventional annuity, a with-profits annuity or defer buying an annuity by putting their pension pot into an \"income drawdown\" product which leaves the money invested in shares but lets you take a regular retirement income. The bald truth is that, for now at least, there is nothing an income drawdown holder can do. The inland revenue-framed rules for drawdown products currently forbid transfers to other providers. So for the time being, drawdown holders must live with the lower investment returns that Equitable is forecasting. But relief is at hand. Next April it is expected that the transfer rules will be lifted. However, it is currently unclear as to whether Equitable will charge a 10% penalty on drawdown transfers when they are legalised. Case study Recently retired, took out drawdown with \u00a3329,000 in pension savings Mike Waller, 59, a former engineer, retired last year and used his lifetime pension savings of \u00a3329,000 to buy an Equitable income drawdown plan, from which he takes an income of about \u00a320,000 a year. \"I wasn't that well-versed in the ways of the City, but Equitable seemed a safe and reliable option. I think the House of Lords ruling on the guaranteed annuities was perverse and it has now landed everybody in the situation we are in today. I think the best thing I should do is sit tight.\" Recommendation Russ Devin, at Epsom-based advisers Morgan Nevill, says: \"From April 2001 he can choose another provider. If Equitable does not apply a penalty, he should jump ship straight away. If there is a penalty, what will drive it is his attitude to Equitable. Many people will just want out because of its problems and poor publicity. However, Mr Waller is taking a cautious level of income, and it may make sense to stay with Equitable for a couple of years and then review the situation. But Alan Stevens, of Portfolio &amp; Pensions Management, says Mr Waller was unwise to take the Equitable plan and thinks a transfer, once allowed, should be seriously considered. He would recommend a self-invested drawdown plan split across several funds and companies. With-profits annuity With-profits annuities work by leaving the money invested in a with-profits fund, made up of equities, bonds and property. The person taking out the annuity opts for a level of income from their investment, and each year the company awards a bonus, depending on how underlying investments have performed. Equitable's 65,000 with-profits annuity holders are in the worst position of all - once you have taken out an annuity you can cannot transfer out of it or surrender it and it is the with-profits customers who will effectively be paying for the guarantees with the company issued to its guaranteed annuity customers. Case study Semi-retired annuity buyer Peter Ransley, a freelance writer for television, invested almost \u00a3500,000 in an Equitable Life with-profits annuity policy in 1997. It has been paying him an annual income of more than \u00a340,000 since then \"and I had been happy with the performance,\" he says. Recommendation Unfortunately, Mr Ransley cannot switch. Equitable Life is predicting that his income may fall by up to 1% following the switch into gilts, but others, including Mr Ransley, think this is a best-case scenario. \"The Doomsday scenario is that in the long run my income will fall by up to 30%. I had put this together for my wife and now I accept she will be very seriously hit,\" he says. Marlene Shalton, director of advisers Chambers Morgan Jones in Cardiff, says: \"This is a big problem as those with a with-profits annuity do not even have the option to pay the 10% penalty and transfer. Equitable Life should offer some other option to people in this situation.\"",

For, in Paul Brown's spectacular design, this must be the most watery Tempest on record. But, though I normally resist aqua-Shakespeare, Jonathan Kent's production is vastly superior to Robert Lepage's wet Dream at the National - the sense of the play still comes through. </p> <p>On entering the theatre you are confronted by an inlet filled with rocks, crags, planks, fallen beams and even an upstage gangway. For the opening tempest the heavens open, and Ariel later descends from the skies and spends much of the evening in the stage lagoon. </p> <p>Brown has clearly enjoyed his island fling but, for me, this is not the ideal way to stage the Tempest: it pre-empts the audience's imagination in its aqueous literalism. But Kent does a good job in not allowing the words to get drowned. Under all the spectacular effects it's a traditional production: instead of being a metaphor for colonialism, the play becomes a study of one man's contest with his own internal demons. </p> <p>This is largely due to the immense subtlety of Ian McDiarmid's Prospero. He is not some cut-price magician but a man who, after 12 years angry exile, is filled with a testy melancholy when his masterplan finally comes to fruition. Watching Miranda fall for Ferdinand, he mutters: \"It goes on, I see, as my soul prompts it,\" as if the reality does not match the expectation. And while, objectively speaking, he has appropriated Caliban's island, he sees himself more as an enlightened tutor betrayed by his pupil: McDiarmid lends sad weight to the idea that all his pains have been \"humanely taken\". </p> <p>The other performances accord with McDiarmid's reading. Far from being a figure of dispossessed pathos, Malcolm Storry's Caliban is a randy, unreformed brute who at one point even rubs himself sexually against a surprised Stephano. And although Aidan Gillen's Ariel pines for his liberty what strikes one most is his athletic compliance with Prospero's requests. But, aside from Brown's design and McDiarmid's Prospero, the dominant feature of the evening is Jonathan Dove's music which seems to float across the water with a distant ethereal beauty. </p> <p> \u0095 Until February 17.
