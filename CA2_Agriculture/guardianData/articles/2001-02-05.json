Apparently there was a \"serious family illness\", which Smith accepted. It stood to reason: they have large families there and their health service is not much better than ours. But they have mobiles too. </p> <p>On Saturday's evidence the manager is rightly desperate to extend West's three-month loan to the end of the season. It is not just his defensive strength or his quick eye for the break. By results alone he has become totemic: different culture, different hair, different class where there is not much. </p> <p>As the Sunderland manager Peter Reid said: \"They were catching us on the break. It was a strange game. We looked like the home side.\" But Derby were also caught offside so often on the break that in three second-half minutes they had three men booked for dissent. With seven booked in all, they will suffer an FA fine. </p> <p>They deserved their win, though preserved it only by an elastic last-minute tip on to a post by Andy Oakes to deny John Oster. The 24-year-old keeper, who came to this debut via Bury, Winsford United and Hull for \u00a3450,000, once worked on a poultry farm. After action of battery dullness, it was a fine free-range save. </p> <p>When Don Hutchison should have beaten him, he chipped wide. But that was Sunderland's only real chance.

He must be wary they do not throw away the good work that has put them in the running for a Champions League place.

The investigation, commissioned by Railtrack, draws attention to the poor relationship that exists between Railtrack and contractors appointed by the company to maintain the track. With a general election approaching, the government is keen to be seen to taking a firm line with Railtrack in a bid to win back the confidence - and votes - of disgruntled passengers. Railtrack's chairman, Sir Philip Beck, is retiring in the summer and the early appointment of a tough and respected successor would send the message that improvements were on the way. Mr James, who calls himself a \"crisis manager\", has made it clear that he is interested in the role, but would accept the job only as a fulltime executive chairman with the backing of Railtrack's directors. But Railtrack is making it equally clear that it wants only a non-executive, part-time chairman so that the day-to-day running of the network remains with new chief executive, Steven Marshall. Before Christmas the company circulated a letter to ministers pointing out that Railtrack's directors would decide who took over as chairman and that they would not tolerate intervention in the selection procedure. The leaked report, undertaken by rail experts from Britain and abroad, was astonished to find that Railtrack had insufficient ultrasonic testing equipment for track inspection. It also blames some of the problems on fragmentation of the industry, which was broken up into more than 100 different parts when British Rail was hurriedly privatised by John Major. Later this month the Health and Safety Executive is expected to recommend to the British transport police that criminal manslaughter charges be brought against up to six officials of Railtrack and Balfour Beatty, its main contractor at Hatfield, responsible for the maintenance of the track. Criminal prosecutions would follow, which the Government hopes would prevent calls for a public inquiry into the events surrounding the Hatfield tragedy.",

      "body": "<p>If disgruntled Tottenham fans take to selling T-shirts outside White Hart Lane bearing the legend \"I saw Spurs score\", it is not difficult to imagine George Graham's reaction. </p> <p>Nearby the manager would open a rival stall, proudly offering jerseys declaring \"I was there when the defence was breached\". A choice of design and colour would be out of the question. With Graham just now everything is tight and unattractive. </p> <p>In drawing positives from this fourth successive goalless stalemate Graham was in a minority. Sure, Spurs are becoming harder to beat but such performances, devoid of quality and imagination, could scarcely be further from what their supporters want. </p> <p>Three shots on targets was the sum of Tottenham's efforts and they have now failed to score in seven of their past eight Premiership matches. Graham's complaint that he is without three experienced strikers masks deeper problems. </p> <p>Spurs' creativity and quality of crossing were so awful that it is hard to see what difference a fit Les Ferdinand would have made. Poor Sergei Rebrov, the one player capable of producing something truly unexpected, has been swallowed up by the ordinariness of it all. </p> <p>\"We could do with a bit of magic from him,\" Graham said, and he could do with Stephen Carr returning from injury as well. In Carr's absence, only the substitute Matthew Etherington looked capable of beating a marker and stretching Charlton's resolute defence. </p> <p>Graham will not be concerned by the booing on the whistle nor the chants of \"We want Graham out\" but he ought to be worried by the thought of losing at Charlton in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Wednesday. </p> <p>That would as good as end Tottenham's season and surely make it more difficult for the prospective owners Enic to persuade Sol Campbell and others to stay. \"It could be a draw,\" Graham said of Wednesday, which was hardly like predicting the night's lottery numbers. </p> <p>Sven-Goran Eriksson, who suffered through this game, will presumably not be rushing to the Valley. Charlton's manager Alan Curbishley pressed the England claims of Richard Rufus afterwards but the game's most impressive touch and movement came from a Dane, Claus Jensen. </p> <p>Spurs' most accomplished passer, Darren Anderton, was peripheral at right wing-back and they showed a hint of fluency only after Tim Sherwood came on. \"Their confidence is very low,\" said Charlton's Matt Svensson. \"You can see that with every player.\" </p> <p>Graham hopes the solidity at the back will foster more belief coming forward but he could do with a few strikes from his midfielders. Between them they have seven goals from open play, and on Wednesday with Andy Booth cup-tied graham may use only one striker. </p> <p>The Scot plans to make signings once the takeover is completed this month and has to hope Enic will back him. Curbishley, meanwhile, goes on overachieving on more modest resources. For all Spurs' talk of injuries, Charlton arrived without their captain, goalkeeper and four strikers. Easily the brighter in the first half, they should have scored in the second but Shaun Bartlett drew a rare save out of Neil Sullivan. </p> <p>Spurs wasted two late chances, so Graham equalled the four successive nil-nils he achieved with Arsenal in 1993. Tottenham fans knew he had been there and done that but they did not want the T-shirt.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If disgruntled Tottenham fans take to selling T-shirts outside White Hart Lane bearing the legend \"I saw Spurs score\", it is not difficult to imagine George Graham's reaction. Nearby the manager would open a rival stall, proudly offering jerseys declaring \"I was there when the defence was breached\". A choice of design and colour would be out of the question. With Graham just now everything is tight and unattractive. In drawing positives from this fourth successive goalless stalemate Graham was in a minority. Sure, Spurs are becoming harder to beat but such performances, devoid of quality and imagination, could scarcely be further from what their supporters want. Three shots on targets was the sum of Tottenham's efforts and they have now failed to score in seven of their past eight Premiership matches. Graham's complaint that he is without three experienced strikers masks deeper problems. Spurs' creativity and quality of crossing were so awful that it is hard to see what difference a fit Les Ferdinand would have made. Poor Sergei Rebrov, the one player capable of producing something truly unexpected, has been swallowed up by the ordinariness of it all. \"We could do with a bit of magic from him,\" Graham said, and he could do with Stephen Carr returning from injury as well. In Carr's absence, only the substitute Matthew Etherington looked capable of beating a marker and stretching Charlton's resolute defence. Graham will not be concerned by the booing on the whistle nor the chants of \"We want Graham out\" but he ought to be worried by the thought of losing at Charlton in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Wednesday. That would as good as end Tottenham's season and surely make it more difficult for the prospective owners Enic to persuade Sol Campbell and others to stay. \"It could be a draw,\" Graham said of Wednesday, which was hardly like predicting the night's lottery numbers. Sven-Goran Eriksson, who suffered through this game, will presumably not be rushing to the Valley. Charlton's manager Alan Curbishley pressed the England claims of Richard Rufus afterwards but the game's most impressive touch and movement came from a Dane, Claus Jensen. Spurs' most accomplished passer, Darren Anderton, was peripheral at right wing-back and they showed a hint of fluency only after Tim Sherwood came on. \"Their confidence is very low,\" said Charlton's Matt Svensson. \"You can see that with every player.\" Graham hopes the solidity at the back will foster more belief coming forward but he could do with a few strikes from his midfielders. Between them they have seven goals from open play, and on Wednesday with Andy Booth cup-tied graham may use only one striker. The Scot plans to make signings once the takeover is completed this month and has to hope Enic will back him. Curbishley, meanwhile, goes on overachieving on more modest resources. For all Spurs' talk of injuries, Charlton arrived without their captain, goalkeeper and four strikers. Easily the brighter in the first half, they should have scored in the second but Shaun Bartlett drew a rare save out of Neil Sullivan. Spurs wasted two late chances, so Graham equalled the four successive nil-nils he achieved with Arsenal in 1993. Tottenham fans knew he had been there and done that but they did not want the T-shirt.",

      "body": "<p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has had his striking problems this season. So much so that he hailed the 31-year-old Dennis Bergkamp almost as a new signing after the Dutchman delivered a rare goal. Multiply Arsenal's concerns fivefold, and the sum of Gordon Strachan's worries come into sight. </p> <p>Strachan insisted afterwards that his team had \"recovered their pride\", but their weakness in front of goal illustrated precisely why Coventry gambled in reviving the pursuit of John Hartson, only to miss this target again. Wenger has suffered different frustrations, but at least Arsenal are still shooting for the FA Cup and Europe, even if the title might as well be the moon. </p> <p>Wenger looked a relieved man, not only because he is still free to fine-tune tactics from the touchline but also because Arsenal travelled successfully for the first time since early November. And even if Bergkamp, like this team, operated in fits and starts, at least he scored - a relative rarity for any Arsenal striker in the league these days. Thierry Henry was rested on Saturday, said to be suffering thigh trouble, though his own goal block could equally have been cited. </p> <p>Wenger has long been counting the lost championship opportunities; Coventry may soon be counting the cost of relegation. But Strachan is determined he will not be the manager vilified for losing top-flight status after 34 years. \"This is Coventry - we've been in tighter spots than this before,\" he said. \"Once in my time we were 9-1 on to go down.\" But the odds are shortening with his side now five points away from the safety zone. </p> <p>Before the match Coventry's chairman Bryan Richardson was crunching different numbers. He offered a vote of confidence in his manager: \"If the board were not 1,000% behind Gordon, you would have to see the matter differently. We don't feel there is any problem in that area. We support Gordon, and we will support Gordon, in every way.\" </p> <p>Would Strachan still be manager if relegated? \"I don't expect that to happen,\" said Richardson. \"That's a hypothetical question and that's how it will have to remain.\" </p> <p>If Coventry do fall, then Richardson will partly blame English football's transfer-fee and player-wage inflation. \"We invested a few years ago heavily in players and in the stadium. We believed we would climb into the eighth-12th [position] bracket.

      "bodyText": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has had his striking problems this season. So much so that he hailed the 31-year-old Dennis Bergkamp almost as a new signing after the Dutchman delivered a rare goal. Multiply Arsenal's concerns fivefold, and the sum of Gordon Strachan's worries come into sight. Strachan insisted afterwards that his team had \"recovered their pride\", but their weakness in front of goal illustrated precisely why Coventry gambled in reviving the pursuit of John Hartson, only to miss this target again. Wenger has suffered different frustrations, but at least Arsenal are still shooting for the FA Cup and Europe, even if the title might as well be the moon. Wenger looked a relieved man, not only because he is still free to fine-tune tactics from the touchline but also because Arsenal travelled successfully for the first time since early November. And even if Bergkamp, like this team, operated in fits and starts, at least he scored - a relative rarity for any Arsenal striker in the league these days. Thierry Henry was rested on Saturday, said to be suffering thigh trouble, though his own goal block could equally have been cited. Wenger has long been counting the lost championship opportunities; Coventry may soon be counting the cost of relegation. But Strachan is determined he will not be the manager vilified for losing top-flight status after 34 years. \"This is Coventry - we've been in tighter spots than this before,\" he said. \"Once in my time we were 9-1 on to go down.\" But the odds are shortening with his side now five points away from the safety zone. Before the match Coventry's chairman Bryan Richardson was crunching different numbers. He offered a vote of confidence in his manager: \"If the board were not 1,000% behind Gordon, you would have to see the matter differently. We don't feel there is any problem in that area. We support Gordon, and we will support Gordon, in every way.\" Would Strachan still be manager if relegated? \"I don't expect that to happen,\" said Richardson. \"That's a hypothetical question and that's how it will have to remain.\" If Coventry do fall, then Richardson will partly blame English football's transfer-fee and player-wage inflation. \"We invested a few years ago heavily in players and in the stadium. We believed we would climb into the eighth-12th [position] bracket. But the price of many players, the whole package, is now astronomical.\" He could have noted that there is no guarantee even when Coventry lay out a club-record \u00a36.5m for Craig Bellamy, which is only half the fee paid by Arsenal for Sylvain Wiltord.

      "body": "<p>The nutters are out in Barcelona. Just two weeks after police in the Catalan capital arrested a man for planning to kidnap a Bar\u00e7a player, the abductors are at it again. To be fair to Santiago Cant\u00f3n, an escapee from Barcelona\u00b4s Modelo Prison and the man up to no good this time round, at least he knew who he was after: midfield baldy and \"little Buddha\", Iv\u00e1n de la Pe\u00f1a. </p> <p>Cant\u00f3n - and a woman whose name hasn't yet been released but whose initials are AMA - followed de la Pe\u00f1a home from the Camp Nou on Monday. Fortunately, de la Pe\u00f1a was on the ball enough (groan) to take down the registration number of the car that pursued him, and managed to escape when he was approached in the underground car park at his home. </p> <p>The attempted kidnappings have come as a huge psychological blow to one Bar\u00e7a player in particular. Michael Reitzeger was \"horrified\" by recent events and admitted on his website that he is \"very worried, especially as this kind of thing gives people all sorts of crazy ideas. I'm constantly looking in my mirrors to see if I'm being followed these days and I keep double-checking the locks and alarms at my house.\"</p> <p>\"I'm terrified,\" declared the Dutchman. \"It's like something out of the Wild West.\" </p> <p>While Reitzeger was busy hiding out in the Sheriff\u00b4s Office on Saturday night, the rest of the Bar\u00e7a side seemed totally unconcerned, destroying Athletic Bilbao in the Nou Camp. </p> <p>Barcelona boss Lorenzo Serra Ferrer had the cheek to enjoy things a bit too much and, worse still, to demand even more. With Serra Ferrer still cajoling his side at 5-0 up with goals from Abelardo, Cocu and Luis Enrique (3), Athletic manager Txetxu Rojo decided he'd had enough and turned to the Bar\u00e7a dug-out to remonstrate with his bemused opposite number. </p> <p>\"What\u00b4s the matter with you?\" he ever-so politely enquired. \"Do you want some more? Isn't this score enough for you?\" Obviously not - Cocu and Overmars added two more to complete the scoring at 7-0. </p> <p>Bar\u00e7a's win has had the Catalan press purring. Sport declared Serra Ferrer\u00b4s side \"the true dream team\". It also re-establishes the blaugranas's championship credentials. But despite 17 games unbeaten, Bar\u00e7a just can't close the gap on Real Madrid, who survived a tough test from M\u00e1laga on Sunday. Dario Silva and Dely Vald\u00e9s yet again proved their class for M\u00e1laga. </p> <p>It was Ra\u00fal, though, who was the real star, despite recent criticism. His two headed goals helped Real Madrid to a 4-3 victory and took him to the top of the league's goalscoring charts, and at 23 he's already scored more in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n than anyone else currently playing. </p> <p>It's not just Bar\u00e7a chasing Madrid, though. Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a remain a point ahead of the Catalans in second place after beating relegation-bound Racing Santander 2-1, with Roy Makaay grabbing two more goals. </p> <p>Makaay's first caused a bit of a stir - he was miles offside, the linesman's flag went up, Racing's defenders stopped, their keeper Jos\u00e9 Ceballos stopped, even Depor\u00b4s players stopped. But eagle-eyed referee Meg\u00eda D\u00e1vila, aware that the \"pass\" to Makaay was a deflection off Racing striker Mazzoni, didn't, and waved the Dutchman on to score easily. A giggling Makaay waxed lyrical over the assist: \"It was a phenonmenal pass from Racing's striker.\" </p> <p>While Bar\u00e7a, Madrid and Depor kept up their end, Valencia stumbled again, this time in Mallorca, where Alberto Luque scored a late equaliser to secure a 2-2 draw for Luis Aragon\u00e9s's side. Things have gone from bad to worse for H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper's super troops, but with the league's four strongest sides now out of the way and new signing Pablo Aimar set to join the team next week (he was in the stand on Sunday), Valencia fans can perhaps look forward to better times.</p> <p>One slight problem, though - the Italian passport fiasco is about to touch down in Spain, with judge Guariniello set to look into 27 La Liga players of \"italoamerican\" origin. And if reports in today's press are anything to go by, Valencia's Fabian Ayala is first in line - with a possible six-month jail sentence if found guilty.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mallorca fans seemed less interested Valencia's visit than the arrival of Celta de Vigo for the Cup quarter-final second-leg in midweek. Mallorquinos carried banners on Sunday warning Celta players, and Valeri Karpin in particular, not to come to the Balearics and accusing the Galician club of \"buying referees with drugs\".</p> <p>Why? Well, all the fun centres on a bruising and extremely bad-tempered first-leg, and on two incidents in particular. </p> <p>First, a penalty given to Celta by referee Antonio L\u00f3pez Nieto despite the fact that he couldn't possibly have seen the \"challenge\" in question - he had his back to the incident and only turned round in time to see the final, and less blatant, stages of a shocking dive from Vagner. </p> <p>The second thing that wound up Mallorca fans was the running battle involving Karpin, Finidi George, Samuel Eto\u00f3 and the Bala\u00eddos crowd which boiled over at the final whistle and again at the airport later that night. Eto\u00f3 had fired a parting \"gesture\" at the Celta fans at the end of the game and one of them decided to go to the airport to have it out with the Cameroon striker in person. </p> <p>Luis Aragon\u00e9s tried to calm the fan down, but soon lost his conciliatory mood when he called Eto\u00f3 a \"black shit\". Aragon\u00e9s took off his glasses (a la Clark Kent) and proceeded to grab the man by the throat. Only the intervention of players and club officials kept a seething Aragon\u00e9s at bay. </p> <p>Meanwhile, L\u00f3pez Nieto\u00b4s inept display has opened up the refereeing debate - yet again. This time, one of the solutions being banded about by players is the introduction of foreign refs. Obviously, Mauro Silva, Miguel Soler and the rest have never seen Graham Poll in action. </p> <p>Even though Pablo Aimar stayed in the stand, there were some big name debuts this weekend. Stan Collymore, on as a second-half sub, couldn't stop Oviedo securing a new league record - they've now gone ten away games without a goal following a 1-0 defeat at Las Palmas. </p> <p>Collymore barely saw the ball. What he did see, though, was the weekend's scariest moment - a clash between Oviedo\u00b4s Pablo Su\u00e1rez and Las Palma\u00b4s Josico, resulting in a bizarre fit for the Oviedo man that left him looking terrified and uncontrollably waving his arms and legs about like an upside-down woodlouse. He was rushed to hospital where, fortunately, he's been given the all-clear. </p> <p>The most eagerly awaited debutant was, of course, Mart\u00edn Palermo. The Argentinian may partake of feather boas and evening dresses but he doesn't wear women's knickers - not during games anyway. Palermo was pulled down by the shorts for what should have been a penalty during Villarreal's 2-0 win over Alav\u00e9s on Sunday. Eager to prove that he'd been fouled, \"El Loco\" left his shorts down and brandished his arse in the ref's direction to reveal a pristine pair of white pants. Lovely. Not that Alvarez was impressed, mind you. </p> <p>The weekend's best newcomer award surely goes to one of Las Palmas's subs, though: it's a warm welcome back to Spain, from this column at least, for Mario Turd\u00f3. </p> <p>John Benjamin may be doing things right in San Sebasti\u00e1n, but he's just not getting the luck - Alexander Mostovoi got a late, late goal for Celta in the Anoeta to secure a 2-2 draw, denying his side a much-needed three points. Fumbling for the Spanish for \"it's a funny old game, Saint\", John Benjamin just shrugged and said \"that's football\". </p> <p>At least Real\u00b4s nearest rivals also dropped points. Numancia drew 0-0 against Valladolid while Osasuna were beaten 3-1 by on-form Espanyol, with Toni Velamaz\u00e1n scoring two brilliant goals. The side Espanyol thrashed 5-0 last week, Zaragoza, bounced back with a hammering of their own: 6-1 against Rayo Vallecano. Juan Esnaider has proven a real boost for Zaragoza since his transfer from Juve's reserves, and the Argentinian was on the scoresheet again - a wonderful touch setting himself up for the home side's second. </p> <p>And although it's still a month away, attention is already turning to the next derbi instalment. Real Madrid\u00b4s directors have decided to welcome Bar\u00e7a with 80,000 white balloons and ... silence. In contrast to the \"barbarism\" of the Camp Nou\u00b4s reception for Figo, Madrid\u00b4s president Florentino P\u00e9rez rather conceitedly regards the silent treatment as a symbol of Madrid's \"honour\" and \"gentlemanliness\". </p> <p>But after M\u00e1laga's 3,000 fans outvoiced the 65,000 madridistas in the Bernab\u00e9u on Sunday, cynics might suggest that a call for silence is, in fact, simply more realistic.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

In the past week, Italian football's big-spending underachievers have faced the sort of sleaze allegations that would make even Neil Hamilton blush. </p> <p>On Tuesday their Uruguay international Alvaro Recoba was exposed as an illegal immigrant - Daily Mail, man those barricades - after his Italian passport was found to be more dodgy than a 47m lira note. Recoba, who recently signed a new contract worth 15bn lire (\u00a34.5m) a season, is now back in Montevideo awaiting permission to return to Italy. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the situation doesn't look good for Inter. Before leaving, Recoba told Milan magistrates that he was given the fake passport by the club's technical director Gabriele Oriali. Oriali later confessed to the crime, claiming he had obtained the documents from \"an official in Rome\". But despite the overwhelming evidence, the club are still insisting that \"no one at the club was responsible for the situation\". No one? We'll see</p> <p>At least the worst of the Recoba scandal had blown over within 24 hours. In its place, however, came something a lot worse: an internet sex ring involving ten Inter players. According to reports, the Inter Ten organised a party with several \u00a31000-a-night hookers at an exclusive restaurant in Milan - and then spent the night with them at the home of one of the players. </p> <p>After initially denying the story, coach Marco Tardelli told state television the allegations were true. \"They were so stupid, they got caught,\" he said. \"Compliments to those who don't get caught. I never got caught.\" Words which must be comforting to Mrs Tardelli</p> <p>Then on Sunday something strange happened: Inter produced their most impressive performance of the season to win 3-0 at Bologna. Christian Vieri started things off, before two goals in a minute from Luigi Di Biagio and Vladimir Jugovic settled the game. Amazingly the win takes Inter into ninth - just five points off a Champions League place.</p> <p><strong>Batistutu camps it up, but Roma still win</strong></p> <p>Gabriel Batistuta turned 32 this week and to celebrate he held a fancy dress party. Abel Balbo and Eusebio Di Francesco both turned up as Casanova - who said footballers were vain? - Marco Delvecchio as an Arab, and the birthday boy donned a Captain Hook suit. Meanwhile, Vincent Candela came disguised as a woman.</p> <p>But there was nothing camp about Roma's performance away at Parma. After going a goal down to Marco di Vaip and missing a penalty through Francesco Totti, the Giallorossi came back to win 2-1, thanks to two superb volleys from Gabriel Batistuta - his 12th and 13th goals of the season - in the last 20 minutes.</p> <p>The performance even impressed Roma's incredibly-hard-to-please coach Fabio Capello, who announced afterwards: \"This was the Roma that I have planned and striven to create and I feel that it is very much mine. </p> <p>\"It was a momentous performance. We truly showed our strength,\" he claimed. \"We played great football and showed great character, pace and strength. But, above all, we showed the right spirit.\" </p> <p>\"I'm not looking at any other sides. They don't interest me - and neither does the six-point lead. With the Roma team that I saw today, I fear nobody and nothing.\" </p> <p>Capello's future at the club is still uncertain - he is yet to sign a new contract and a move to Barcelona is reportedly afoot - but Roma fans are in no doubt that their coach should stay, even jokingly chanting 'Let's kidnap Capello' during the game. </p> <p>\"My contract is not important,\" was Capello's response. \"What matters is the team, my players, and their conviction that we can win. The rest are meaningless details.\" </p> <p><strong>Lazio keep up the chase</strong></p> <p>Inspiring Roma to a six-point gap at the top of Serie A would be enough for most coaches. But not Capello. On Saturday he used a press conference to lambast the Italian Football Federation for not punishing Lazio after the club fielded illegally registered EU players - notably Juan Sebastian Veron. </p> <p>\"Ours is the only federation which has not taken action, which has not docked points from teams which have committed irregularities of this kind,\" claimed Capello.</p> <p>Not surprisingly those comments met with an angry response - and a lawsuit - from Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti who called them \"gratuitous and without foundation\". </p> <p>\"Has Capello gone mad?\" he asked. \"It seems that Lazio's title has hurt a lot of people, most of all Capello, who doesn't seem to have digested it yet.\" </p> <p>But the furore didn't distract Lazio on the pitch as two goals from Hernan Crespo - that's now seven in four games - and one from Juan Veron helped them edge past Lecce 3-2. </p> <p><strong>Juventus lose ground</strong></p> <p>After notching up an impressive 12-game unbeaten run, nobody expected Juventus to stumble at newly promoted Atalanta. But that's what exactly happened. Juve went ahead after 72 minutes after Massimo Paganin headed into his own net. But somehow - especially as Juventus had all the play - Atalanta managed to conjure up an unlikely victory, thanks to goals from substitute Stefano Lorenzi and Nicola Ventola.</p> <p>Juve coach Carlo Ancelotti was understandably a disappointed man afterwards when he said: \"When we went 1-0 up we should have closed the match out but instead we lost concentration and conceded a silly goal from a set piece. </p> <p>\"What upsets me is not so much having lost but losing when we played so well,\" he continued. \"After a very balanced first half we dominated the second. A draw would have been a fairer result.\"</p> <p>But as Ancelotti picks up the pieces from the defeat, maybe he should take a few lessons from what's going on at Internazionale and Roma. Judging by this weekend's events, a side that enjoys themselves off the pitch also seems to win on it.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Amazingly the win takes Inter into ninth - just five points off a Champions League place. Batistutu camps it up, but Roma still win Gabriel Batistuta turned 32 this week and to celebrate he held a fancy dress party. Abel Balbo and Eusebio Di Francesco both turned up as Casanova - who said footballers were vain? - Marco Delvecchio as an Arab, and the birthday boy donned a Captain Hook suit. Meanwhile, Vincent Candela came disguised as a woman. But there was nothing camp about Roma's performance away at Parma. After going a goal down to Marco di Vaip and missing a penalty through Francesco Totti, the Giallorossi came back to win 2-1, thanks to two superb volleys from Gabriel Batistuta - his 12th and 13th goals of the season - in the last 20 minutes. The performance even impressed Roma's incredibly-hard-to-please coach Fabio Capello, who announced afterwards: \"This was the Roma that I have planned and striven to create and I feel that it is very much mine. \"It was a momentous performance. We truly showed our strength,\" he claimed. \"We played great football and showed great character, pace and strength. But, above all, we showed the right spirit.\" \"I'm not looking at any other sides. They don't interest me - and neither does the six-point lead. With the Roma team that I saw today, I fear nobody and nothing.\" Capello's future at the club is still uncertain - he is yet to sign a new contract and a move to Barcelona is reportedly afoot - but Roma fans are in no doubt that their coach should stay, even jokingly chanting 'Let's kidnap Capello' during the game. \"My contract is not important,\" was Capello's response. \"What matters is the team, my players, and their conviction that we can win. The rest are meaningless details.\" Lazio keep up the chase Inspiring Roma to a six-point gap at the top of Serie A would be enough for most coaches. But not Capello. On Saturday he used a press conference to lambast the Italian Football Federation for not punishing Lazio after the club fielded illegally registered EU players - notably Juan Sebastian Veron. \"Ours is the only federation which has not taken action, which has not docked points from teams which have committed irregularities of this kind,\" claimed Capello. Not surprisingly those comments met with an angry response - and a lawsuit - from Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti who called them \"gratuitous and without foundation\". \"Has Capello gone mad?\" he asked. \"It seems that Lazio's title has hurt a lot of people, most of all Capello, who doesn't seem to have digested it yet.\" But the furore didn't distract Lazio on the pitch as two goals from Hernan Crespo - that's now seven in four games - and one from Juan Veron helped them edge past Lecce 3-2. Juventus lose ground After notching up an impressive 12-game unbeaten run, nobody expected Juventus to stumble at newly promoted Atalanta. But that's what exactly happened. Juve went ahead after 72 minutes after Massimo Paganin headed into his own net. But somehow - especially as Juventus had all the play - Atalanta managed to conjure up an unlikely victory, thanks to goals from substitute Stefano Lorenzi and Nicola Ventola. Juve coach Carlo Ancelotti was understandably a disappointed man afterwards when he said: \"When we went 1-0 up we should have closed the match out but instead we lost concentration and conceded a silly goal from a set piece. \"What upsets me is not so much having lost but losing when we played so well,\" he continued. \"After a very balanced first half we dominated the second. A draw would have been a fairer result.\" But as Ancelotti picks up the pieces from the defeat, maybe he should take a few lessons from what's going on at Internazionale and Roma. Judging by this weekend's events, a side that enjoys themselves off the pitch also seems to win on it. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

The second series of the US smash-hit reality TV show, Survivor, was filmed about five hours drive from Cairns, north Queensland, and began airing in the US a week ago. As with most foreign tourists, America's conception of Australia is largely gleaned from the annals of the two Crocodile Dundee films, and Survivor II makes no attempt to challenge these outback stereotypes of snakes, spiders and benevolent Aborigines. This latest gift from the gods for Australia's tourist industry won't do much to educate potential visitors about the harsh realities of life in the Australian interior. Last week, for example, it was revealed that Aborigines are dying at almost three times the rate of other Australians, with the average male dying at the age of just 46. But the only view of indigenous Australia the Survivor II audience gets are two token Aborigines, dressed up in kangaroo skins and wielding spears and boomerangs. The photogenic American contestants are, one by one, voted out of pseudo-indigenous tribes called Ogakor and Kucha, while attempting to light fires (not recommended in the tinder-dry bush at this time of year), feast on \"bush tucker\", and become the last one standing in a Machiavellian quest for $1m.

Instead, the contestant with the least convincing positive mental attitude was summarily ejected, to the echo of a didgeridoo soundtrack. Despite its American ethos and its, at best, casual acquaintance with Australia, Survivor II is described as \"an ideal vehicle to help showcase Australia\" by the Australian tourist commission's managing director, John Morse. Tourism is spreading like wildfire in Australia: it was up 11% to a record 4.9m international tourists last year, with the tourist commission forecasting a rise to 5.3m this year. The number of foreign tourists visiting Sydney, now considered by many an essential place to celebrate New Year's Eve, is growing by 10% each year.

It is a common courtesy, observed by many western companies and individuals, to acknowledge and seek the permission of the \"traditional owners\" before entering remote areas. As Australia welcomes its tourists with the kind of charming friendliness that was such an admired part of the Sydney Olympics, so Survivor II is being welcomed onto Australia's Channel Nine.

The appealing aspect of a Club Med holiday to a postwar Europe still locked into holidays on wet beaches and in grey guesthouses was that it offered a safe, good time in a fantasy beachside environment.

      "body": "<p>They are two cities of roughly the same size, with similar cultures and accent, 140 miles apart - yet separated by a frequently stormy sea.</p> <p>In the mid 19th century, tens of thousands of starving immigrants poured into Liverpool from Dublin to work in the city's docks and workshops as the area became one of the world's great trading posts.</p> <p>Now, in a remarkable reversal, Ireland's dynamic new entrepreneurs and Dublin's cash-rich property elite are pouring tens of millions into Liverpool and helping to transform a down-at-heel city into a millionaires' playground. It has become a place to dump surplus capital and make money work faster than in overheating Ireland.</p> <p>They are buying up flats by the hundred, helping to fuel an unprecedented property boom, investing in new port facilities to serve high-speed ferries, and even planning supermarket distribution depots - to serve Ireland, not England.</p> <p>The historic connections between the cities are being further strengthened by cut-price air travel and express ferries - making it much faster, and cheaper, for Liverpudlians to get to Dublin than to London.</p> <p>Since the cities twinned in 1998, David Tinsey of the Liverpool chamber of commerce said the links between them have strengthened to such an extent that their economies are almost merging.</p> <p>\"Dublin is not thought of as a foreign city,\" he said. \"People here consider Dubliners to be kith and kin. The links are natural. As the economy in Dublin peaks, business people are looking elsewhere for prime areas to invest. London is expensive and a more difficult market to penetrate.\"</p> <p>Across the Irish Sea, Phil Sweeney, director of sales and marketing for the Prem Group, one of Dublin's largest property concerns, agreed. They are taking out leases on scores of Liverpool apartments and are now opening serviced offices in the city.</p> <p>\"A lot of people in Dublin are sitting on serious wealth and it is getting harder and harder to find investment opportunities over here,\" she said. \"Development in the city is just not encouraged any more.

      "bodyText": "They are two cities of roughly the same size, with similar cultures and accent, 140 miles apart - yet separated by a frequently stormy sea. In the mid 19th century, tens of thousands of starving immigrants poured into Liverpool from Dublin to work in the city's docks and workshops as the area became one of the world's great trading posts. Now, in a remarkable reversal, Ireland's dynamic new entrepreneurs and Dublin's cash-rich property elite are pouring tens of millions into Liverpool and helping to transform a down-at-heel city into a millionaires' playground. It has become a place to dump surplus capital and make money work faster than in overheating Ireland. They are buying up flats by the hundred, helping to fuel an unprecedented property boom, investing in new port facilities to serve high-speed ferries, and even planning supermarket distribution depots - to serve Ireland, not England. The historic connections between the cities are being further strengthened by cut-price air travel and express ferries - making it much faster, and cheaper, for Liverpudlians to get to Dublin than to London. Since the cities twinned in 1998, David Tinsey of the Liverpool chamber of commerce said the links between them have strengthened to such an extent that their economies are almost merging. \"Dublin is not thought of as a foreign city,\" he said. \"People here consider Dubliners to be kith and kin. The links are natural. As the economy in Dublin peaks, business people are looking elsewhere for prime areas to invest. London is expensive and a more difficult market to penetrate.\" Across the Irish Sea, Phil Sweeney, director of sales and marketing for the Prem Group, one of Dublin's largest property concerns, agreed. They are taking out leases on scores of Liverpool apartments and are now opening serviced offices in the city. \"A lot of people in Dublin are sitting on serious wealth and it is getting harder and harder to find investment opportunities over here,\" she said. \"Development in the city is just not encouraged any more. We have lost a lot of our tax incentives, which makes cities outside Dublin - particularly Liverpool - an attractive proposition.\" Part of the attraction is the more favourable fiscal regime in a UK outside the eurozone: taxes levied on properties valued between \u00a325,000 and \u00a3500,000 are small compared with Irish taxes of 15% on similarly priced homes. As a result, the chief executive of one large Liverpool property company said he knows of at least one Irishman who is borrowing \u00a330m of mortgage cash each year to buy flats in Liverpool. The type of investment and talent coming across the Irish Sea is also diversifying, taking in sectors other than the traditional areas of property and construction. Mr Tinsey points to supermarket distribution and the professional services sector as a prime example of the shift. High profile Dublin residents such, as fashion designer John Rocha, are also taking an interest. He has chosen to launch his second major hotel interior design project in Liverpool. The timing of the Irish interest in Liverpool is no coincidence. The city council and key players in the private sector point to a change in attitudes to Liverpool and to a new business confidence taking root. Tom Bloxham, whose Manchester-based Urban Splash has been at the forefront of residential property development in the north west, said: \"Liverpool has not been seen as a business-friendly city historically. But all this is changing. New investment capital is coming in and a chunk of it is coming from Ireland.\" Paul Bolton of property developers the Charlton group agreed: \"We have strong relationships with a number of Irish firms and they have an appetite for rental properties in the city centre in particular.\" Mr Bolton said that Dublin's new-found business confidence is rubbing off on Merseyside.

      "body": "<p>You might well think eco-tourism is a contradiction in terms. How can places of great natural beauty, or wildlife, be preserved once tourists start visiting in their thousands, bringing with them the need for services and development? Is it really possible to have a guilt-free holiday? Can you visit a place without damaging it in some way? </p> <p>The answer to that is in most cases no. But that's not to say we should all stay at home. With careful planning and research and a responsible attitude, you can holiday all round the world while ensuring that your conscience remains clear. But a word of warning - look carefully at what companies that offer 'green holidays' actually mean by the phrase. It is no greener to drive a motor boat down the Amazon than hire a car on the Costa del Sol, probably less so since the damage is already done on the latter. Unless a company is actively looking to minimise their impact on host countries or even working to make contact a positive thing, the claims should be regarded with scepticism. </p> <p>But it's not all bad news. If you look carefully there are many small independent tour companies or environmental organisations who are genuinely committed to develop sustainable tourism. The Association of independent Tour Operators' (<a href=\"http://www.aito.co.uk\" target=\"_neW\">AITO</a> Committee for Responsible Tourism has developed voluntary guidelines for travel companies which it hopes to make mandatory within two years.</p> <p> In the meantime, here are 10 ideas for how to take a guilt-free green break, from work camps to conventional packages. </p> <p><strong>1. Go Organic (on a bike)</strong></p> <p>Not everyone is a fan of the 'charity trek' but if you want to acquire a virtuous green glow, this is hard to beat. In May a bike ride from Bilbao to Barcelona will raise money for the Soil Association which campaigns for organic food and sustainable agriculture and forestry. Participants will stay at organic guest houses and eat organic produce, boosting local organic enterprises. There's no age limit but participants must raise \u00a32,500, half of which is for the Soil Association, half for the trip's expenses. Suzanne Austin, who went last year, says, \"The trip will remain ingrained in my mind as well as my heart for the rest of me life. I wanted to get fit. All I wanted to do when I got back was to get on my bike and ride as fast as possible back to those mountains in Spain.\" Email <a href=\"mailto:info@soilassociation.org\"> info@soilassociation.org</a> for more details.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.organicplacestostay.com/main.html\" target=\"_new\">Organic Places to stay</a> has details of organic hotels, b&amp;bs and cottages throughout the UK and much of Europe as well as further beyond - from Sri Lanka to Hawaii.</p> <p><strong>2. Leisure and Learning</strong></p> <p>The long running environment education charity <a href=\"http://www.field-studies-council.org\" target=\"_new\">Field Studies Council</a> offers a vast number of courses, some to very exotic locations. Their aim is \"low-impact\" tourism - small groups staying in local accommodation using local guides and experts to promote \"environmental understanding for all\". Customer satisfaction is high. Michael Edwards, who has travelled with them to remote parts of China, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Spain and Cuba says he's only ever had \"remarkable\" experiences. \"We always go somewhere interesting; we are shown things by experts and you don't feel you're harming the people or the wildlife. In fact because they use local resources, it even feels as if you are doing some good.\" More information can be found at <a href=\"http://www.fscoverseas.mcmail.com/home.htm\" target=\"_neW\"> fscoverseas.mcmail.com</a>. Back in the UK, there are numerous courses in study centres like Flatford Mill. </p> <p><strong>3. Plant a tree in Iceland</strong></p> <p>For unadulterated nature, you could do worse than head for Iceland. So few people live in this extraordinary island that last year the number of tourists exceeded the population. Fortunately there's plenty of wilderness to go around, and in some respects tourism has been positive for the country. Inge Ingesdottir of <a href=\"http://www.northernlightstours.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Northern Lights Tours</a> encourages tourists to plant a tree before they leave. Another environmentally-aware company, <a href=\"http://www.arctic-experience.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Arctic Experience</a> pioneered whale-watching trips - now such money spinners that Iceland has abandoned ideas of commercial whaling. Both companies offer treks, riding holidays and whale-watching. Northern Lights tours even offers 'children of nature' youth camps where children \"run free, spending most of their time outdoors, living a healthy lifestyle\".</p> <p><strong>4. Tourism for conservation</strong></p> <p>If you want a wildlife holiday, try to use a company that takes conservation seriously, and choose a destination where conservation measures are already in place and small-scale tourism is properly managed by locals. Arctic Experience's sister company, <a href=\" www.discover-the-world.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Discover the World</a> runs wildlife tours to exotic locations, including Jordan and Madagascar. It's one of a few small companies actively supporting conservation work in the host countries: they support the Born Free Foundation in Tanzania. <a href=\" http://www.discoveryinitiatives.com/discoveryinitiatives.asp\" target=\"_new\">Discovery Initiatives</a> is actively working with several conservation charities including The <a href=\" http://www.panda.org/\" target=\"_new\">World Wildlife Fund</a>. Director, Julian Matthews says, \"tourism should guarantee that things which draws us now should be the same in a hundred years. Currently, our most popular trip is to the orang-utans in Borneo. Participants stay at the camp made famous by Birute Galdikas and help research and tracking. The company donates $1,000 per person to fund wardens and resources.\"</p> <p><strong>5. Beach holidays with a conscience</strong></p> <p>In terms of the global footprint, the traditional beach holiday is the worst offender. They cater for large numbers travelling by air, increasing carbon dioxide emissions. They use hotels and complexes which not only scar the landscape but are not locally owned so tourist money doesn't help the local economies. But, a few small and admirable companies are doing their best to minimise tourist impact, even putting something back into the host countries. <a href=\"http://www.gambia.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">The Gambia Experience</a> helps local schooling projects and promises to match tourist donations. They also encourage tourists to understand and respect Gambia's own commitment to conserving their environment.</p> <p><strong>6. A hands-on approach</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.laskarina.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Laskarina</a>, which operates mainly on the Greek islands and won The Observer's best travel company award for four years running, has \"a hands on approach\" to the environment. They've encouraged and helped locals to restore traditional buildings which can be included in their programmes, they distribute cotton shopping bags to their clients in an attempt to reduce use of plastic bags, and they are encouraging numerous environmental initiatives including working with local environmentalists after a serious fire on Samos.</p> <p><strong>7. Agro-tourism</strong></p> <p>Since the first appearance of gites in holiday brochures in 1970, agrotourism has become an important part of the tourist market. It still makes sense environmentally. Agrotourism injects money into rural communities, it encourages locals to value and preserve their natural environment, and leads to the restoration of traditional houses.

      "bodyText": "You might well think eco-tourism is a contradiction in terms. How can places of great natural beauty, or wildlife, be preserved once tourists start visiting in their thousands, bringing with them the need for services and development? Is it really possible to have a guilt-free holiday? Can you visit a place without damaging it in some way? The answer to that is in most cases no. But that's not to say we should all stay at home. With careful planning and research and a responsible attitude, you can holiday all round the world while ensuring that your conscience remains clear. But a word of warning - look carefully at what companies that offer 'green holidays' actually mean by the phrase. It is no greener to drive a motor boat down the Amazon than hire a car on the Costa del Sol, probably less so since the damage is already done on the latter. Unless a company is actively looking to minimise their impact on host countries or even working to make contact a positive thing, the claims should be regarded with scepticism. But it's not all bad news. If you look carefully there are many small independent tour companies or environmental organisations who are genuinely committed to develop sustainable tourism. The Association of independent Tour Operators' (AITO Committee for Responsible Tourism has developed voluntary guidelines for travel companies which it hopes to make mandatory within two years. In the meantime, here are 10 ideas for how to take a guilt-free green break, from work camps to conventional packages. 1. Go Organic (on a bike) Not everyone is a fan of the 'charity trek' but if you want to acquire a virtuous green glow, this is hard to beat. In May a bike ride from Bilbao to Barcelona will raise money for the Soil Association which campaigns for organic food and sustainable agriculture and forestry. Participants will stay at organic guest houses and eat organic produce, boosting local organic enterprises. There's no age limit but participants must raise \u00a32,500, half of which is for the Soil Association, half for the trip's expenses. Suzanne Austin, who went last year, says, \"The trip will remain ingrained in my mind as well as my heart for the rest of me life. I wanted to get fit. All I wanted to do when I got back was to get on my bike and ride as fast as possible back to those mountains in Spain.\" Email info@soilassociation.org for more details. Organic Places to stay has details of organic hotels, b&amp;bs and cottages throughout the UK and much of Europe as well as further beyond - from Sri Lanka to Hawaii. 2. Leisure and Learning The long running environment education charity Field Studies Council offers a vast number of courses, some to very exotic locations. Their aim is \"low-impact\" tourism - small groups staying in local accommodation using local guides and experts to promote \"environmental understanding for all\". Customer satisfaction is high. Michael Edwards, who has travelled with them to remote parts of China, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Spain and Cuba says he's only ever had \"remarkable\" experiences. \"We always go somewhere interesting; we are shown things by experts and you don't feel you're harming the people or the wildlife. In fact because they use local resources, it even feels as if you are doing some good.\" More information can be found at fscoverseas.mcmail.com. Back in the UK, there are numerous courses in study centres like Flatford Mill. 3. Plant a tree in Iceland For unadulterated nature, you could do worse than head for Iceland. So few people live in this extraordinary island that last year the number of tourists exceeded the population. Fortunately there's plenty of wilderness to go around, and in some respects tourism has been positive for the country. Inge Ingesdottir of Northern Lights Tours encourages tourists to plant a tree before they leave. Another environmentally-aware company, Arctic Experience pioneered whale-watching trips - now such money spinners that Iceland has abandoned ideas of commercial whaling. Both companies offer treks, riding holidays and whale-watching. Northern Lights tours even offers 'children of nature' youth camps where children \"run free, spending most of their time outdoors, living a healthy lifestyle\". 4. Tourism for conservation If you want a wildlife holiday, try to use a company that takes conservation seriously, and choose a destination where conservation measures are already in place and small-scale tourism is properly managed by locals. Arctic Experience's sister company, Discover the World runs wildlife tours to exotic locations, including Jordan and Madagascar. It's one of a few small companies actively supporting conservation work in the host countries: they support the Born Free Foundation in Tanzania. Discovery Initiatives is actively working with several conservation charities including The World Wildlife Fund. Director, Julian Matthews says, \"tourism should guarantee that things which draws us now should be the same in a hundred years. Currently, our most popular trip is to the orang-utans in Borneo. Participants stay at the camp made famous by Birute Galdikas and help research and tracking. The company donates $1,000 per person to fund wardens and resources.\" 5. Beach holidays with a conscience In terms of the global footprint, the traditional beach holiday is the worst offender. They cater for large numbers travelling by air, increasing carbon dioxide emissions. They use hotels and complexes which not only scar the landscape but are not locally owned so tourist money doesn't help the local economies. But, a few small and admirable companies are doing their best to minimise tourist impact, even putting something back into the host countries. The Gambia Experience helps local schooling projects and promises to match tourist donations. They also encourage tourists to understand and respect Gambia's own commitment to conserving their environment. 6. A hands-on approach Laskarina, which operates mainly on the Greek islands and won The Observer's best travel company award for four years running, has \"a hands on approach\" to the environment. They've encouraged and helped locals to restore traditional buildings which can be included in their programmes, they distribute cotton shopping bags to their clients in an attempt to reduce use of plastic bags, and they are encouraging numerous environmental initiatives including working with local environmentalists after a serious fire on Samos. 7. Agro-tourism Since the first appearance of gites in holiday brochures in 1970, agrotourism has become an important part of the tourist market. It still makes sense environmentally. Agrotourism injects money into rural communities, it encourages locals to value and preserve their natural environment, and leads to the restoration of traditional houses. Richard Hearn, managing director of Inntraveland Chair of AITO's Committee on Responsible Tourism says he's proud of the impact his holidays have had on areas like the Asturias in Northern Spain. There, farmers were struggling and the countryside was becoming very neglected. His company used local bed and breakfasts and tapped into local resources and helped open up neglected footpaths. \"When tourism values nature it has a knock on effect.\" Friends of the Earth have tried to encourage agrotourism on Cyprus to counter the destructive effects on the environment of coastal ribbon development. Sunvil Holidays organises trips to less visited parts of the island, and has a strong commitment to environmental protection. 8. Volunteer work nearer home It may not be as exotic as Namibia, but there's a lot to be said for staying at home and helping conserve what's on your own doorstep. For a start it's a great and inexpensive way of getting fit. The British Trust for Conservation Volunteers runs Work camps and Canal Camps. The Wildlife Trust also need volunteers for days and weekends doing jobs including pond clearing and hedge laying. 9. Environmental research in exotic locations Earthwatch will take you to more remote and exotic locations where you can participate in environmental research projects. They can offer advice on how to fund your trip through sponsorship, and this year, funded by Lottery money, they are also offering awards for the over 50s to take part in one of their conservation projects. For more info contact millenium@earthwatch.org. 10. Go it alone The jury is still out on whether you do less harm by going it alone. More money goes into the local economy, but you may just be opening up remote parts for mass tourism. If you do travel independently, get a good guidebook. Bradt publications, pioneers of wilderness travel, puts a high priority on wildlife and environment. If you travel by plane, consider paying a 'carbon tax' - see Carbon Care for more information, or plant a tree or two to neutralise your carbon emissions. \u0095 Consult Tourism Concern for general issues about responsible tourism, destinations and guides.",

      "body": "<p>Alongside eating your greens, giving your seat up for pregnant women and not dropping litter in the street, voting has always occupied a particular ethical place within the British social psyche. Ranking somewhere between community responsibility and moral rectitude, it has been regarded as the act of the upright citizen and concerned individual.</p> <p>Even as colonies around the globe were denied the ballot and MPs in Northern Ireland were left to die on hunger strike, the vote was hailed as an inalienable right. It was our passport to modernity and civilisation; the cornerstone of democracy; like death, the great leveller.</p> <p>Almost regardless of where you stood on the political spectrum during the latter half of the 20th century, you could always see a reference point to support the innate, wholesome decency of the electoral act. It was why we fought the Nazis and why we will fight the commies if we have to, said the patriots. Suffragettes died for it, Martin Luther King lived for it and Nelson Mandela went to jail for it, said the internationalists.</p> <p>But somehow voting has begun to look, to many, like brussels sprouts left out over night. We understand there is good in it, but in the cold light of day we have the lost the taste for it and, given the choice, would rather go hungry for the time being.</p> <p>The last election saw the lowest turnout since the second world war. The next, according to a recent Guardian/ ICM poll, promises to be even lower. The number of people who say they would be certain to vote if there was an election tomorrow stands at 60% of the electorate, compared with 64% at the same stage in 1997. In a parliamentary byelection in Leeds in July 1999, turnout dipped to a postwar low of 19.6%.</p> <p>To blame this all on the ideological vacuity of mainstream politics prompted by Labour's drift to the right, is tempting but simplistic. The turnout for elections to the Greater London Assembly, where Livingstone stood as a clear left choice, was also low. When the leftwing independent Dennis Canavan vacated his Westminster seat of Falkirk West at the end of last year, prompting both a leftwing and nationalist surge, the election turnout was the lowest in Scotland for more than 50 years.</p> <p>The stay-away might not be entirely Labour's doing, but it is almost completely its problem. Its biggest threat come the next election is not the Tories, but turnout. The two times that the Conservatives have beaten Labour in the popular vote since 1997 - in the European elections of 1999 and the local elections of 2000 - the problem has not been Labour voters switching sides, but Labour supporters refusing to take sides.</p> <p>This has always been the principal glitch in New Labour's electoral arithmetic. It has operated on the calculated assumption that as it went foraging for votes on the right and centre, there was a hard core of Labour supporters who would vote for it come what may, because politically they had nowhere else to go. The trouble is, it got its sums wrong. What it didn't bargain on was its supporters not going out of the house.</p> <p>This, too, is reflected in the polls. The Conservative vote has hardened slightly since the last election with the likelihood of Tory supporters turning out to vote rising slightly on a statistical scale from 9.02 in January 1997 to 9.10 now. Meanwhile the likelihood of Labour voters going to the polls has dropped sharply from 9.11 to 8.68.</p> <p>Blair has referred to this as apathy, but it is something far more dangerous. The issue is not people who cannot be bothered but people who are fed up with being bothered. Many of them were, in the past, the foot soldiers of active democratic citizenry - activists who not only voted but spent their spare time going out at night and trying to get other people to vote too. When they sit on their hands it is not apathy but disillusionment, the seeds of which were sown before the last election and were already bearing fruit on May 1 1997.</p> <p>Ask any Labour supporter to recall just one image that signified the sweetness of victory that night and they all say the same thing - Michael Portillo losing his seat. On a night when Labour won the largest majority of any single party since 1924, bringing with it a new generation of political leadership and a record number of women MPs, the high point of the night was not Labour being voted in, but the Tories being kicked out.</p> <p>After 18 years of one-party rule that was maybe as it should have been. In any case, it is almost certainly as Tony Blair had intended it to be. The whole thrust of the last campaign was to reassure middle England that it could trust him by lowering expectations of how different a Labour government would be.</p> <p>To the extent to which these low expectations delivered him a decisive victory at the last election, this strategy was successful; to the extent to which these low expectations are defining him in the run-up to the next election, it is proving a huge liability. For a healthy democracy is not founded just on the number of people who turn up to vote, but on the choice that they have when they get there.</p> <p>The issue is not whether there is any difference between Labour and the Tories - there patently is - but whether there is sufficient difference for there to be any moral argument for putting your cross next to one instead of the other.</p> <p>It is no good evoking Nelson Mandela in this regard. They may have cheered him at last year's party conference, but under current asylum laws, had he managed to flee apartheid, he would have been detained when he reached Britain. It is difficult to imagine that he would have wanted to swap Robben island for Campsfield detention centre.</p> <p>Claiming you're not as bad as the other lot might work in opposition, but it is a feeble excuse after four years in power. The rise in pensions and teachers' pay, for all their faults, suggest the Labour leadership has at least partly understood that this time people want to vote for, rather than against, something.</p> <p>It also suggests that the very part of the movement that New Labour once regarded as dead is actually keeping it afloat. It is the left, inside and outside the party, that has kept the issues of pensions and public sector pay at the fore and the unions who backed it during the fuel crisis.</p> <p>Meanwhile it is the right which has proved the greatest liability by descending into the kind of vain bickering, venal indulgences and personal rivalries that has led voters, according to a recent poll, to believe that Labour is sleazier than the Tories.</p> <p>Under those circumstances, Millbank would do better to promise even higher pensions and better public services than appeal to our sense of active citizenship and moral rectitude come polling day.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gary.younge@theguardian.com\">gary.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Alongside eating your greens, giving your seat up for pregnant women and not dropping litter in the street, voting has always occupied a particular ethical place within the British social psyche. Ranking somewhere between community responsibility and moral rectitude, it has been regarded as the act of the upright citizen and concerned individual. Even as colonies around the globe were denied the ballot and MPs in Northern Ireland were left to die on hunger strike, the vote was hailed as an inalienable right. It was our passport to modernity and civilisation; the cornerstone of democracy; like death, the great leveller. Almost regardless of where you stood on the political spectrum during the latter half of the 20th century, you could always see a reference point to support the innate, wholesome decency of the electoral act. It was why we fought the Nazis and why we will fight the commies if we have to, said the patriots. Suffragettes died for it, Martin Luther King lived for it and Nelson Mandela went to jail for it, said the internationalists. But somehow voting has begun to look, to many, like brussels sprouts left out over night. We understand there is good in it, but in the cold light of day we have the lost the taste for it and, given the choice, would rather go hungry for the time being. The last election saw the lowest turnout since the second world war. The next, according to a recent Guardian/ ICM poll, promises to be even lower. The number of people who say they would be certain to vote if there was an election tomorrow stands at 60% of the electorate, compared with 64% at the same stage in 1997. In a parliamentary byelection in Leeds in July 1999, turnout dipped to a postwar low of 19.6%. To blame this all on the ideological vacuity of mainstream politics prompted by Labour's drift to the right, is tempting but simplistic. The turnout for elections to the Greater London Assembly, where Livingstone stood as a clear left choice, was also low. When the leftwing independent Dennis Canavan vacated his Westminster seat of Falkirk West at the end of last year, prompting both a leftwing and nationalist surge, the election turnout was the lowest in Scotland for more than 50 years. The stay-away might not be entirely Labour's doing, but it is almost completely its problem. Its biggest threat come the next election is not the Tories, but turnout. The two times that the Conservatives have beaten Labour in the popular vote since 1997 - in the European elections of 1999 and the local elections of 2000 - the problem has not been Labour voters switching sides, but Labour supporters refusing to take sides. This has always been the principal glitch in New Labour's electoral arithmetic. It has operated on the calculated assumption that as it went foraging for votes on the right and centre, there was a hard core of Labour supporters who would vote for it come what may, because politically they had nowhere else to go. The trouble is, it got its sums wrong. What it didn't bargain on was its supporters not going out of the house. This, too, is reflected in the polls. The Conservative vote has hardened slightly since the last election with the likelihood of Tory supporters turning out to vote rising slightly on a statistical scale from 9.02 in January 1997 to 9.10 now. Meanwhile the likelihood of Labour voters going to the polls has dropped sharply from 9.11 to 8.68. Blair has referred to this as apathy, but it is something far more dangerous. The issue is not people who cannot be bothered but people who are fed up with being bothered. Many of them were, in the past, the foot soldiers of active democratic citizenry - activists who not only voted but spent their spare time going out at night and trying to get other people to vote too. When they sit on their hands it is not apathy but disillusionment, the seeds of which were sown before the last election and were already bearing fruit on May 1 1997. Ask any Labour supporter to recall just one image that signified the sweetness of victory that night and they all say the same thing - Michael Portillo losing his seat. On a night when Labour won the largest majority of any single party since 1924, bringing with it a new generation of political leadership and a record number of women MPs, the high point of the night was not Labour being voted in, but the Tories being kicked out. After 18 years of one-party rule that was maybe as it should have been. In any case, it is almost certainly as Tony Blair had intended it to be. The whole thrust of the last campaign was to reassure middle England that it could trust him by lowering expectations of how different a Labour government would be. To the extent to which these low expectations delivered him a decisive victory at the last election, this strategy was successful; to the extent to which these low expectations are defining him in the run-up to the next election, it is proving a huge liability. For a healthy democracy is not founded just on the number of people who turn up to vote, but on the choice that they have when they get there. The issue is not whether there is any difference between Labour and the Tories - there patently is - but whether there is sufficient difference for there to be any moral argument for putting your cross next to one instead of the other. It is no good evoking Nelson Mandela in this regard. They may have cheered him at last year's party conference, but under current asylum laws, had he managed to flee apartheid, he would have been detained when he reached Britain. It is difficult to imagine that he would have wanted to swap Robben island for Campsfield detention centre. Claiming you're not as bad as the other lot might work in opposition, but it is a feeble excuse after four years in power. The rise in pensions and teachers' pay, for all their faults, suggest the Labour leadership has at least partly understood that this time people want to vote for, rather than against, something. It also suggests that the very part of the movement that New Labour once regarded as dead is actually keeping it afloat. It is the left, inside and outside the party, that has kept the issues of pensions and public sector pay at the fore and the unions who backed it during the fuel crisis. Meanwhile it is the right which has proved the greatest liability by descending into the kind of vain bickering, venal indulgences and personal rivalries that has led voters, according to a recent poll, to believe that Labour is sleazier than the Tories. Under those circumstances, Millbank would do better to promise even higher pensions and better public services than appeal to our sense of active citizenship and moral rectitude come polling day. gary.younge@theguardian.com",

A new measure aimed at providing financial support for parents with infants under one is to form part of a three-pronged approach designed to lift a million children out of poverty in a second Labour term.

A university spokeswoman said: \"Ethical issues surrounding the acceptance of benefactions are considered by the executive committee of the university council.\" \"We need to ask some serious and searching questions about our involvement with these people,\" said Dr Evans, who has taken on the university authorities on several occasions, notably over its methods of appointing professors. \"We need to take a very hard look at whether we should take any more money from them. And, certainly, if they are convicted of offences as a result of the legal proceedings in India, we should give back the money they have donated.\" She added: \"Sometimes we are very naive. We are babes in arms. Our eyes tend to glaze over when we see the number of noughts on the end of the cheque. \"We have no system or policy on who we should take money from and who we shouldn't. And we need to develop a policy.\"",

Addressing a community plan priority and therefore an issue important to local people <br> Addressing local needs has been our starting point in choosing the proposed PSA outcomes. Each of the proposed PSA outcomes has been drawn from the key community priorities identified in the Tameside community plan. </p> <p>The plan was produced jointly by 19 key public bodies, voluntary organisations and businesses who have worked together, under a new local strategic partnership - the Tameside community forum - to develop the plan and to commit to a shared set of priorities and actions.</p> <p>The development of the community plan has been a major exercise for the council and its partners. The community plan was published in April 2000. It is based on what local people have said they want to see for Tameside over the next few years. Its publication followed an extensive programme of consultation with local residents, businesses and other stakeholders.</p> <p>2. Addressing national priorities<br> We have examined how our outcomes will feed into the achievement of a wider national agenda such as the national strategy for neighbourhood renewal, the social service national priorities guidance (which underpins the PSA between the Department of Health and the Treasury), national best value performance measures, Department for Education and Employment targets etc. </p> <p>3. Improving the outcomes for those in the Tameside community most at risk of social exclusion <br> Making sure social inclusion is mainstream to the thinking and activity of the Council and its partners is critical. The council's analysis suggests that achievement on inclusion priorities will make a measurable impact on local people's lives and has been a key factor for consideration in the choice of local PSA outcomes.</p> <p>4. Offers the potential of substantial efficiency gains through developing innovative forms of service delivery<br> Outcomes have also been chosen on the basis of the level of potential gains possible by breaking down inhibitors and looking radically at new ways of service delivery. Tameside Council has a long track record of realising such gains. </p> <p>\u0095 We have an innovative approach to performance management that has delivered substantial service improvements in services right across the organisation. It is based upon the achievement of continual improvement through the practical application of a series of tools and techniques. We have actually delivered higher quality services while reducing unit costs. For example, within our housing benefit service we have reduced waiting times by 75% and increased the percentage of new claims dealt within 14 days from 60% to 100% while reducing unit costs.</p> <p>\u0095 We have a mature approach to the procurement of services based around the 'what matters is what works' principle. We were one of the first councils to externalise our elderly persons' homes. We have been proactive in developing (award winning) joint health and social care services and we want to do more through the local PSA pilot. Last year we transferred the whole of the council's housing stock as part of a wider strategy that is going to deliver substantial improvements to the choice and quality of social housing in Tameside.</p> <p>\u0095 As an organisation we are committed to learning. For example, as well as having achieved beacon status for our joint mental health service, we have also been awarded beacon council status this year for our work around community safety and in two areas (quality environment, access to services) for next year's scheme.</p> <p>\u0095 We were praised by the IDeA for our track record in innovation and willingness to embrace change and for our work in developing joint working to deliver real community benefits.</p> <p>We want to build on the successes already achieved through the development of a Local PSA. We believe removing the inhibitors to new forms of service delivery can realise substantial gains. For the pilot we want to: </p> <p>\u0095 Use the electronic delivery of services to join public services together. Our baseline work has already been seen and praised by two government ministers (Ian McCartney and Margaret Beckett).<br> \u0095 Promote independent living for older people and reduce the dependence on residential and nursing care by bringing health and social services together (along with the achievement of other key outcomes such as benefit take up)<br>\u0095 Develop new higher quality social housing through new forms of delivery and more choice through new joint working across all the social housing providers. <br> \u0095 Address key determinants of social exclusion in the borough, by working with our local schools to implement new approaches to tackling school absence and underachievement.<br> \u0095 Deliver real reductions in traffic accidents through the development of innovative, collaborative and cost-effective approaches to local road design and management.</p> <p><strong>What flexibilities have ministers given?</strong></p> <p>Key flexibilities include:<br> \u0095 Working with government to develop new electronic ways of data sharing <br>\u0095 Potentially becoming a national pilot help to drive forward the early delivery of electronic public services <br>\u0095 Discussion on removing benefit barriers that act against older people living independently <br>\u0095 More joined up working between the Benefits Agency and the council to make sure older people are receiving benefit entitlement <br>\u0095 Long term budget planning for education grants <br>\u0095 Use of speeding fines to help reduce traffic accidents <br>\u0095 A commitment to more joint working between the Highways Agency, local police and council in tackling road safety.</p> <p><strong>What will the \u00a31m pump-priming money be used for?</strong></p> <p>Key features include: <br>\u0095 Development of ICT training centres <br>\u0095 Development of new IT systems across the key social landlords and other partners <br>\u0095 Provision of a new one stop shop for all social housing tenants <br>\u0095 More occupational therapy equipment and intensive care packages for people aged over 65 <br>\u0095 New electronic registration systems for schools with high truancy levels <br>\u0095 New speed reduction schemes at accident black spots <br>\u0095 More training for classroom assistants in schools with a high proportion of Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage children <br> \u0095 New GNVQ accredited out of hours learning ICT scheme and the development of out of school clubs in local community buildings </p> <p><strong>Performance reward grant </strong><br> If we achieve all our targets, we would receive \u00a35.2m in performance reward grant</p>",

The plan was produced jointly by 19 key public bodies, voluntary organisations and businesses who have worked together, under a new local strategic partnership - the Tameside community forum - to develop the plan and to commit to a shared set of priorities and actions. The development of the community plan has been a major exercise for the council and its partners. The community plan was published in April 2000. It is based on what local people have said they want to see for Tameside over the next few years. Its publication followed an extensive programme of consultation with local residents, businesses and other stakeholders. 2. Addressing national priorities We have examined how our outcomes will feed into the achievement of a wider national agenda such as the national strategy for neighbourhood renewal, the social service national priorities guidance (which underpins the PSA between the Department of Health and the Treasury), national best value performance measures, Department for Education and Employment targets etc. 3. Improving the outcomes for those in the Tameside community most at risk of social exclusion Making sure social inclusion is mainstream to the thinking and activity of the Council and its partners is critical. The council's analysis suggests that achievement on inclusion priorities will make a measurable impact on local people's lives and has been a key factor for consideration in the choice of local PSA outcomes. 4. Offers the potential of substantial efficiency gains through developing innovative forms of service delivery Outcomes have also been chosen on the basis of the level of potential gains possible by breaking down inhibitors and looking radically at new ways of service delivery. Tameside Council has a long track record of realising such gains. \u0095 We have an innovative approach to performance management that has delivered substantial service improvements in services right across the organisation. It is based upon the achievement of continual improvement through the practical application of a series of tools and techniques. We have actually delivered higher quality services while reducing unit costs. For example, within our housing benefit service we have reduced waiting times by 75% and increased the percentage of new claims dealt within 14 days from 60% to 100% while reducing unit costs. \u0095 We have a mature approach to the procurement of services based around the 'what matters is what works' principle. We were one of the first councils to externalise our elderly persons' homes. We have been proactive in developing (award winning) joint health and social care services and we want to do more through the local PSA pilot. Last year we transferred the whole of the council's housing stock as part of a wider strategy that is going to deliver substantial improvements to the choice and quality of social housing in Tameside. \u0095 As an organisation we are committed to learning. For example, as well as having achieved beacon status for our joint mental health service, we have also been awarded beacon council status this year for our work around community safety and in two areas (quality environment, access to services) for next year's scheme. \u0095 We were praised by the IDeA for our track record in innovation and willingness to embrace change and for our work in developing joint working to deliver real community benefits. We want to build on the successes already achieved through the development of a Local PSA. We believe removing the inhibitors to new forms of service delivery can realise substantial gains. For the pilot we want to: \u0095 Use the electronic delivery of services to join public services together. Our baseline work has already been seen and praised by two government ministers (Ian McCartney and Margaret Beckett). \u0095 Promote independent living for older people and reduce the dependence on residential and nursing care by bringing health and social services together (along with the achievement of other key outcomes such as benefit take up) \u0095 Develop new higher quality social housing through new forms of delivery and more choice through new joint working across all the social housing providers. \u0095 Address key determinants of social exclusion in the borough, by working with our local schools to implement new approaches to tackling school absence and underachievement. \u0095 Deliver real reductions in traffic accidents through the development of innovative, collaborative and cost-effective approaches to local road design and management. What flexibilities have ministers given? Key flexibilities include: \u0095 Working with government to develop new electronic ways of data sharing \u0095 Potentially becoming a national pilot help to drive forward the early delivery of electronic public services \u0095 Discussion on removing benefit barriers that act against older people living independently \u0095 More joined up working between the Benefits Agency and the council to make sure older people are receiving benefit entitlement \u0095 Long term budget planning for education grants \u0095 Use of speeding fines to help reduce traffic accidents \u0095 A commitment to more joint working between the Highways Agency, local police and council in tackling road safety. What will the \u00a31m pump-priming money be used for? Key features include: \u0095 Development of ICT training centres \u0095 Development of new IT systems across the key social landlords and other partners \u0095 Provision of a new one stop shop for all social housing tenants \u0095 More occupational therapy equipment and intensive care packages for people aged over 65 \u0095 New electronic registration systems for schools with high truancy levels \u0095 New speed reduction schemes at accident black spots \u0095 More training for classroom assistants in schools with a high proportion of Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage children \u0095 New GNVQ accredited out of hours learning ICT scheme and the development of out of school clubs in local community buildings Performance reward grant If we achieve all our targets, we would receive \u00a35.2m in performance reward grant",

It is good news for all councils who want to enter into a new kind of relationship with central government to deliver better outcomes for local people. </p> <p>The six local PSAs signed by Blackburn, Kent, Middlesbrough, Stockton on Tees, Tameside, Warwickshire and government ministers begin to deliver on one of the Local Government Association's (LGA) key priorities - our belief that local authorities can do their job better if they have more freedom and flexibility to act. </p> <p>Greater local discretion was the LGA's starting point when we sat down with the Treasury to design local PSAs. Several government projects in recent years have invited local authorities to suggest areas where they need greater freedom and flexibility to tailor their actions to suit local needs - so that concept is not new. </p> <p>But translating this general invitation into concrete action has been difficult, and neither the government nor local authority partners would claim that tangible gains had been made. </p> <p>Local PSAs are, by contrast, emerging as an effective, and potentially highly effective, route for councils to win more freedom to get on with delivering services with reduced interference from central government. </p> <p>They are different because agreeing with ministers what flexibility can be given is part of the deal.

      "bodyText": "The signing of local public service agreements (PSAs) by six pilot local authorities today is not just good news for those councils' residents. It is good news for all councils who want to enter into a new kind of relationship with central government to deliver better outcomes for local people. The six local PSAs signed by Blackburn, Kent, Middlesbrough, Stockton on Tees, Tameside, Warwickshire and government ministers begin to deliver on one of the Local Government Association's (LGA) key priorities - our belief that local authorities can do their job better if they have more freedom and flexibility to act. Greater local discretion was the LGA's starting point when we sat down with the Treasury to design local PSAs. Several government projects in recent years have invited local authorities to suggest areas where they need greater freedom and flexibility to tailor their actions to suit local needs - so that concept is not new. But translating this general invitation into concrete action has been difficult, and neither the government nor local authority partners would claim that tangible gains had been made. Local PSAs are, by contrast, emerging as an effective, and potentially highly effective, route for councils to win more freedom to get on with delivering services with reduced interference from central government. They are different because agreeing with ministers what flexibility can be given is part of the deal. In order to improve school results, for instance, the local PSA authority will want greater flexibility to construct the right local education policy. For the pilots, this involves greater freedom and certainty of funding in the council's share of the school standards fund. For some of the pilots, there is also a commitment to work with the Department for Education and Employment to streamline the number of education plans required from a council. Some authorities have promised to increase rates of recycling. Warwickshire has agreed with the government to borrow an extra \u00a32.5m to support new recycling initiatives. Local PSA pilots have also been allowed to test out the concept of unsupported credit approvals - councils borrowing above their allocated credit approvals, providing they are willing to meet the cost of those loans from within their own budget. On youth justice, Sunderland hopes to agree flexibility in the way it uses youth justice funding. The council will now be able to bring more coherence to young offender support initatives. Complex rules have made this difficult in the past. The government has made clear that flexibility will not always be available as a ready package for the start of the three-year life of a PSA. But the agreements are allowing councils and the government to recognise problems and to commit to working together - as part of the deal - to find solutions. In Kent, this sort of commitment may help alleviate problems of differing VAT regimes for local and health authorities, which are currently inhibiting the take up of powers to pool their budgets. In Middlesbrough, it may help to simplify and speed up the payment of disabled facilities grants for home adaptations for older people. As the first local PSAs are agreed, much will be made of the financial rewards that they offer to councils. The government is negotiating tough targets with authorities in areas such as social care, education, transport and recycling, because an authority that meets its targets for stretched achievement - over and above its best value performance plan - will be rewarded financially. Performance reward grant - a payment potentially amounting to 2.5% of an authority's budget - will be available in proportion to the amount of extra achievement. The financial rewards are substantial for the authorities involved. But from the national point of view, we must recognise that a key benefit of local PSAs is that they offer a way to open doors, and create movement on previously intractable issues. If future local PSAs can build on what has been achieved today, we have a powerful tool for innovation, improved performance, and a more creative relationship between central and local government. \u0095 Tony Blake was involved in the local public service agreements negotiations with central government",

      "bodyText": "Talks are to be held in an attempt to avoid a repeat of today's strike by London Underground drivers which crippled services and caused fights among frustrated commuters waiting for buses. The huge disruption led to overcrowding on bus and rail services and police were called to several scuffles in queues as people desperately tried to get to work. Just 10% of tube trains ran, although there were no services on several lines in the morning rush hour, leading to chaotic scenes across the capital. Traffic was around 30% heavier than normal as commuters took to their cars, jamming roads into London throughout the day. The train drivers' union Aslef said that there was solid support among its 2,200 members for the strike, which was called over safety fears about the proposed public-private partnership (PPP) to run the tube. Aslef leaders will meet LU bosses at the conciliation service, Acas, tomorrow to try to head off two further strikes planned for the next two Mondays. \"I am pleased with the wonderful show of support and solidarity from our members, other workers and the travelling public,\" said Aslef general secretary Mick Rix. \"I hope that, in light of the strike, management will now start taking a more constructive approach to resolving the dispute.\" The strike cost LU an estimated \u00a33.6m in lost revenue and led to a miserable day for the three million travellers who normally use the tube each day. \"There's been a lot of crowding and queuing and there have been some scuffles, but nothing that's really required major police intervention,\" a City of London police spokesman said. \"People have been falling out with people who have failed to observe the queue system.\" London mayor Ken Livingstone, who travelled to the capital by train after spending the weekend in Brighton said: \"The situation is totally unreasonable. \"It has been provoked by London Underground managers who have been consistently unconvincing about safety on the tube to myself and the trade unions.\" A convoy of about 250 taxi drivers added to the travel chaos by driving from Gatwick to Victoria in central London as part of a dispute with the British Airports Authority. An AA Roadwatch spokesman said that the rush hour was \"horrendous\", with sections of the M25 brought to a virtual standstill. Aslef members picketed depots and there were reports that other workers were refusing to cross picket lines. A British Transport police spokesman said that the biggest picket lines were at Golders Green, Cockfosters and Baker Street. He said picketing had been peaceful, but added that the transport situation was \"disastrous\". \"There's not many trains running at all. There's continuous overcrowding at main line stations.\" The strike went ahead despite progress last week between the government and the capital's transport commissioner, Bob Kiley, over the public-private partnership plans. Steve Norris, Transport for London board member, described today's strike as a \"cynical waste of time\". He said it had nothing to do with safety and a lot to do with job preservation. City law firm Charles Russell warned that employees not turning up for work because of the strike could expect their pay to be docked or even face disciplinary action. Employment lawyer Michael Bradshaw said: \"Employees should be aware that, if they do not turn up for work today, citing the tube strikes as the reason, then they may find employers have a right to deduct a day's pay. \"In extreme circumstances, an employer could bring disciplinary action.\" Related articles 05.02.2001: Commuters face chaos on tube strike London Underground: the issue explained 04.02.2001: Legal threat to Kiley tube deal 02.02.2001: Tube boss wins privatisation victory 02.02.2001: Drivers go ahead with tube strike Useful links Aslef Transport for London The tube Greater London authority Department of Transport's plans for London",

You heard it here first when Gareth Southgate signed for Southampton, and we left all our red-faced competitors standing with our Tony-Yeboah-to-big-London-club scoop. So you'll be excited to hear that, according to sources close to Tottenham owners ENIC, Glenn Hoddle will definitely NOT be taking over at White Hart Lane in the summer. Stick with us, this one sounds sort of plausible.</p> <p>If you believe the latest rumours - and who the hell are you calling gullible? - Hoddle was approached by Spurs chief executive Daniel Levy to return to his old club as manager. The God-fearing Saint agreed, on the condition he was given \u00a325m to spend on players who are not Andy Booth. Sadly, Tottenham don't have two brass bawbies to rub together, and Levy could only dangle \u00a310m in front of Hoddle's unbelievably square-jawed face.</p> <p>As a result, the Southampton boss told his suitors to take a walk (on water). Whether this will save the skin of Arsenal's George Graham - who, as current Spurs manager, would have been out on his ear if Hoddle had agreed to move - is another issue. But we're fairly confident that Hoddle won't be going to Spurs in the close season. How can you trust us? Well, what we've told you makes good sense, for a start. And haven't you heard the saying \"third time lucky\"?</p> <p><strong>BRAZIL NUTS</strong></p> <p>In England last week, David Beckham was spat at by foul-mouthed West Ham fans, who surrounded his car and chanted that familiar ditty about his wife. Everyone was rightly horrified, but at least Beckham knows the good citizens of Alderley Edge aren't armed to the teeth and planning to steal his beloved Ferrari 355. And that's something you can't say about some of the not-so-good citizens of Rio de Janeiro. </p> <p>At 10pm last night, Brazilan superstar Ronaldo was driving towards his home in the fashionable Barra da Tijuca district of Rio when his BMW was blocked off by another car. Before you could say \"long-term knee injury\", three armed gunmen jumped out and surrounded the striker's pricey vehicle. \"They pointed guns to my head and told me to get out,\" Ronaldo revealed. \"I was calm, turned around and just prayed nothing would happen.\" Fortunately, nothing did. \"They were aggressive, but one recognised me and they lowered their guns,\" he continued. \"I sensed a reaction of shock and surprise, but it was too late. They weren't going to waste the trip.\" </p> <p>After forcing Ronaldo to hand over his keys and wallet, the car-jackers then sped off, leaving him standing shocked - but unhurt - at the side of the road. But at least the story has a happy ending: the car, equipped with a satellite tracking system, was found undamaged an hour later in a residential neighbourhood. Only Ron's cash pouch was missing. What's more, despite the assault, Ronaldo says he has no plans to leave Brazil or hire a bodyguard. \"I was born here. I don't want to leave now and I hope that the situation will get better,\" he insisted, as The Fiver wondered whether Becks would be so loyal if he were to suffer a similar misfortune on the Cheshire plains.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Diego still takes cocaine on an occasional basis.

      "bodyText": "Two adults and two children have been killed in a shooting incident at a housing estate in Camberley, Surrey, police said today. The bodies were discovered by officers at a family home in Heathside Park, an estate in the suburb of Heathside, on the outskirts of Camberley, after worried neighbours reported a build-up of milk and post at the address. Surrey police confirmed the dead were a man, a woman and two children. It is understood the victims were all members of the same family. Detective Inspector Dean Hollands refused to confirm that police were not seeking anyone else in connection with the deaths. He said: \"At the moment that's not something we're really concerned about. We are trying to ascertain what occurred in the house and what we're dealing with.\" Det Insp Hollands said that police were alerted to the tragedy at 10am yesterday by a call from a resident on the new private estate. He said: \"The milk and papers had been building up. It was just a concerned neighbour that called.\" Neighbours watched from their windows as forensic officers conducted a fingertip search of the house. The five bedroom red brick house, worth an estimated \u00a3300,000, was sealed off and a white forensics tent erected by Surrey police officers. An R-reg black Saab and a T-reg green Peugeot 406 were parked on the drive outside the house, which has a double garage. Two officers were maintaining a guard at the imposing black gates of the fenced-off estate, situated in an exclusive part of Camberley. Barbara MacDonald, chief reporter at the Camberley News, said: \"Police cordoned off the estate this morning at 9.30am. \"They completely sealed it off and were not allowing anybody onto the estate. It's a fairly small estate of 30 to 40 houses and as far as I'm aware there are not armed police there.\" Detectives said they will not disclose the names of those killed until relatives have been contacted.

      "bodyText": "The campaign is over, the pollsters have had their day, and there is a rare unity of opinion in Israel, and its neighbours, that the next prime minister will be Ariel Sharon. The liberal Tel Aviv daily, Ha'aretz, reports that, in private conversations, Barak supporters are already conceding defeat. The report goes on: \"The sole concern of Sharon's advisors was that a low turnout could cast a cloud over his victory. \"If the voter turnout is less that 50%, this would seriously damage his legitimacy and give ammunition to his opponents, said one Sharon advisor, especially if Sharon forms a narrow government.\" The paper rather gallantly, if predictably, continues to endorse Barak: \"The two candidates for the post of prime minister need to be judged on the basis of three main criteria - their intentions, their diplomatic policies [in dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflict], and their personalities. \"In each of these categories, Ehud Barak is a better option than Ariel Sharon. When all the data is added up, there is a single, unequivocal conclusion - Barak must be elected tomorrow.\" The Jerusalem Post reports that the Palestinian national authority, headed by Yasser Arafat, is already preparing to deal with Sharon. Commentator Yossi Goell voices widespread Israeli disquiet with the system of directly elections for the prime ministership: \"As far as one can tell, one day ahead of tomorrow's vote, incumbent prime minister Ehud Barak, who was elected primarily because he seemed to be so much more trustworthy than his 1999 opponent Binyamin Netanyahu, will be booted out of office primarily because of significant flaws in his own personality. \"The fact that his current opponent, Ariel Sharon, is also nothing to write home about will apparently make little difference in the latest of a series of elections in which voters have been forced to choose between the lesser of two evils.\" The Post website also features a electronic reader poll, in which 76% of respondents opt for Sharon, and just 24% for Barak. The result is obviously slewed by the paper's rightwing views and readership, but still the poll has attracted, so far, an impressive 41,000 responses. The latest issue of the monthly Palestine Times carries a biting commentary by the redoubtable former peace negotiator, Hanan Ashrawi. She is bitterly critical of Sharon's record, but detects some advantage in his probable victory. \"For the Palestinians, Barak has left us with very little to fear from Sharon in the area of murder and mayhem. \"If peace is far with Barak, it will only become more unattainable with Sharon.

One of the firm's partners, Ben Rich, told the Independent that Mr Mandelson was \"soiled goods\" with \"a reverse Midas touch\" just a day before the agency became the Hindujas' voice-piece. The firm, which prides itself on being an issues-led consultancy, was recommended to the Hindujas by a mutual friend. The account is being run by Luther Pendragon partner Charles Stewart-Smith, who co-founded the firm with George Pitcher and two other members of staff in 1992.

Controversial Irish drama Rebel Heart opened with 3.9m and averaged just 3.3m and a 13% share over its four-week run. It was the same story for BBC1 on Friday night, with hotly anticipated new comedy drama Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years and Pauline Quirke sitcom vehicle Office Gossip making no impact on The Bill's ratings. Office Gossip led off BBC1's new Friday night comedy double-bill at 9pm, with Adrian Mole following on at 9.30pm. Both had a 26% share of viewing, though Office Gossip had a slightly higher audience, with 6.3m to Adrian Mole's 6m.

      "body": "<p>Hey, I can see the crack in your ass!\" shrieks the stranger with the endless thighs and glitter boots. Ah, that must be Candace. The legs walk into the room a few seconds before the face. I'm bending over, smelling the leather seats in the terribly posh club, thinking they probably taste pretty good with a bit of mustard. And she seems quite excited. \" I could! I could see the crack .\" </p> <p>Candace Bushnell wrote the newspaper column Sex and the City, which she turned into a book, which was turned into the television series. It's about four women (including a journalist, Carrie Bradshaw, based on herself) making their way in the world. It is shocking, groundbreaking, empowering, or old-fashioned, depending on whom you speak to. </p> <p>The four New Yorkers are hungry for sex, on their terms. They spend much of their time shagging, then comparing notes with their girl friends. It's a world defined by cocaine, penis size, cappuccino, blow jobs, executive jobs and Ferraris. Bushnell's writing has been called \"Jane Austen with Martini\" and compared to the novels of Edith Wharton. Which is fair enough because ultimately, despite their financial independence, the lives of the women in Sex and the City are defined by men. Like Austen and Wharton, she examines the ways that women position themselves in society and, hopefully, snare a man. </p> <p>In her dazzly boots and hip-length skirt Bushnell is looking very country and western. She has an amazing knack of crossing her legs without revealing anything improper. Quite a feat in that skirt. \"I was going somewhere, and this guy sat down next to me and said, 'Are you Nashville?' and I said, 'No, why?'\" She lurches into the dopey Homer Simpson voice that she often uses to impersonate flailing men. \"And he said, 'Well your boots - you look like a country and western singer.' I almost punched him.\" She spits out the word \"punch\". No one messes with Candace Bushnell. </p> <p>How often does she hit people? \"I don't usually . . . I've slapped a guy's face once or twice.\" She says she has dreams in which she throws punch after punch and they never connect. Has she ever caused damage? \"Noooooah. Noooooooah . I'm not really big enough to cause damage. Also it's not really me. I don't like physical violence. I did get really mad at one guy once and I slapped his face.\" Now she's turned into a drama queen on confessional TV, her liquid lips quivering with angst. \" It was as shocking to me as it was to him. \" </p> <p>She's painting her face for the photograph with a make-up brush that could double as a mop. \"That's professional, a professional make-up brush.\" She addresses her mouth with a finger and red lipstick. \"I actually have a lip brush but I'm too lazy to use it.\" </p> <p>Then she addresses the photographer. \"I'm not that young. Make my head really tiny.\" Why? \"Cos then it can't look that bad. The smaller it is the better I'll look.\" Bushnell is pretty and skinny. She never diets, never eats healthy foods, never exercises. In the past, she says, men have walked up to her and told her that her body is wrong, not womanly. \"Well a womanly shape just happens to be if you're a woman. Whatever it is.\" </p> <p>Bushnell's new book is called 4 Blondes. Whereas the characters in Sex and the City are slight and self-absorbed but likable, here they are slight and self-absorbed and contemptible. If they have a good side, we don't get to see it. The book is spiked with withering observations: from the vacuous beauty, Janey, who screws the wealthiest man possible every summer to get herself a great vacation house in the Hamptons; to the society princess suffocating in her trophy marriage; to the smug, married journalists who sit in judgment on the rest of the world. It's a powerful, well-written book that occasionally makes you shiver with recognition. </p> <p>She says she feels her women have changed since Sex and the City, which she wrote in her mid-30s. \"In Blondes, the women are not looking for men, they're looking for themselves, looking for some kind of meaning, and their place in the world.\" She gives \"place\" a good whipping. \"I think that's the hardest thing to find, your place in the world. Why are you here? What do you do? And should you even be here or should you just kill yourself? Don't you wake up some mornings and think maybe I should just kill myself?\" </p> <p>Why does she think we're here? \"I don't know. Are we here to reproduce or do something else? I think people do innately aspire to everything... success, being happy, being loved. Janey would like to be loved but nobody is ever going to love her because she is an asshole . It's like if you're a jerk you'll end up with jerks.\" Then there's Winnie, the superior journalist who measures out her life in coffeespoons, and damns anyone who dares to differ. \"Winnie's just nasty isn't she?\" Yes, I say, she's disgusting. \"I know, I know, and I love that.\" She giggles, and says it's fun to write nasty. </p> <p>But she bristles when I suggest the characters in 4 Blondes are irredemable. \"I think that's a really, really judgmental thing to say. I think everybody's made mistakes and behaved in ways they probably shouldn't have, and I think we should be a little bit more generous. I think they're human. I feel like I'm pretty moral, and I can be a judgmental type of person, but I'm probably much more generous than people who feel the characters are irredemable. Like, how cruel. Like, none of these people has killed anybody. You'd probably have more sympathy for a murderer than these characters who think dark thoughts and show you something about yourself.\" </p> <p>She has a point. And in fact, at the end she does redeem her characters, she does give them their moment of happiness. Bushnell says so many people are quick to damn the characters because they see themselves in them, and that hurts. Take the portrait of Winnie's loveless marriage. \"Winnie is a bit horrible, but she kind of gets better. You understand why she is so horrible because she's so frustrated and she shouldn't have married James. A lot of women think about the men they're with, you know that he's not holding up his end. If you sit down with some unhappily married women and all that stuff comes out, but they don't have the guts to end the relationship because there's that fear maybe there's nothing better out there.\" </p> <p>Bushnell, 41, has never married and has had a series of high-profile affairs. In 1978 she left rural Glastonbury, Connecticut, and headed for New York. Soon after she moved in with Gordon Parks, the great photographer who directed the original Shaft movie. Bushnell was 18, Parks 60. She calls him \"the coolest guy you'll ever meet\". There followed the relationship with Ron Galotti, the fearsome, Ferrari-fixated New York publisher (and the role model for Mr Big in Sex and the City). Now she's going out with Stephen Morris, a 34-year-old English venture capitalist. When she's not in New York she lives with him in Chelsea. She says they are very happy, may get married, may not, may have kids, may not. </p> <p>Bushnell worked for many years on women's magazines, like Winnie does. Magazines that told their readers if you followed the rules everything would turn out OK. \"If you never eat fat, and you exercise, and any problem that comes up you go to a shrink, and if you decorate your house cheaply but chicly, it's all going to be fine isn't it?\" She says there's an anarchist in her that wanted to scream out it was all a lie. </p> <p>I ask her what gave her greatest satisfaction as a journalist. She mentions two stories she wrote about runaway teenagers and migrant workers. She spent weeks with her subjects, on the streets and in trailer parks. \"The social workers were like, 'Don't sit on their couch, you could get something.' It was like, 'I've got jeans on, I'll sit on the couch.' \" At times she speaks with the shambling eloquence of the girls in the movie Clueless. </p> <p>Although she is most proud of these articles, they are also what made her want to quit journalism. \"The thing about it is, you come in from the outside and befriend these people. They really think they're your friend and you're going to help them down the road, and you're going in as a journalist to do that story and when the story's done you can't continue a relationship with those people. I thought there was something cruel about that. I didn't like it, I just didn't think it was nice.\" </p> <p>She looks embarrassed. \"I know you're not buying that, but it doesn't seem like the right thing to do.\" I do buy it. </p> <p>Bushnell orders a Coke and lights yet another fag. \"You're not gonna get all hyper again are you?\" joshes the waiter. \"I'm like one of those hyperactive kids - don't give him sugar!\" She talks about people we know in America, and her publicist, and the journalist she's just seen. She doesn't seem to have a bad word for any of them. I start muttering, ineptly, about how she understands ghastly people so well, and I was wondering... She finishes the sentence for me. \"Oh, you mean am I one?\" </p> <p>Again, she says she doesn't think the people she satirises are truly horrible. \"I think they're behaving in the way that people do in certain circumstances. Most people are easily swayed by the circumstances they are in.\" </p> <p>Bushnell says she couldn't write a book like Sex and the City now. \"In my mid-30s I was much more absorbed by men.\" At the time she wanted to realistically depict the sex lives of single women in New York, but all that has been lost on television. \"In the TV series they go out and meet a different guy every week. That just doesn't happen to most women. I have some girl friends who'd go to a party and they'd met a footballer or something and they'd have sex with him in a closet, and I was always, 'Oh my God! How could you do that!' Like a mixture of 'gosh, that's really brave' and 'that's really slutty'.\" </p> <p>She never did that? \"No. I'm not like that. I couldn't. I'm too conservative. That's so not me. I actually couldn't do that.\" She says she dabbled with cocaine at Studio 54 in her younger days, but that's about it. \"I'm very conservative. I don't necessarily dress conservatively.\" She looks at her thighs. \"I think my skirt is a bit inappropriately short.\" But it does go down well on book tours. \"Now I mostly wear pants.\" </p> <p>So where did she find her gallery of vile creatures? \"There was this time in the late 80s and there was this excess and everyone was going mad, and people were pretty nasty to each other.\" Is she talking about the likes of Brett Easton Ellis and his literary brat pack? She looks shocked. \"No, they were probably the nice ones. He's a doll. Other people. I think the meanest people are people in their late 20s and early 30s. They're so judgmental and they're mean to each other, not very forgiving. And I was around this group of people where they were all shagging each other and taking ecstasy and doing all this stuff, and I just loved to hear about it but I didn't really want to do it.\" She pauses. \"Ever since I was a kid I realised I'm one of those people who will run to the edge of the cliff with everyone else and then I'll watch them jump off. I won't jump off, but others will.\" </p> <p>Bushnell hasn't finished her Coke. Her PR says we have to wind up because the News of the World is waiting to take her round town in a stretch limo. A stretch Saab. She'll have to lie on the back seat and make the most of her legs. \"Let me just warn you they have two champagne flutes. I said you had an upset stomach and you might not drink any,\" the PR says. It's the last thing she feels like doing, but a book tour is a book tour. \"I'm so depressed,\" Bushnell says. \"I might throw up on them.\"</p>",

If you sit down with some unhappily married women and all that stuff comes out, but they don't have the guts to end the relationship because there's that fear maybe there's nothing better out there.\" Bushnell, 41, has never married and has had a series of high-profile affairs. In 1978 she left rural Glastonbury, Connecticut, and headed for New York. Soon after she moved in with Gordon Parks, the great photographer who directed the original Shaft movie. Bushnell was 18, Parks 60. She calls him \"the coolest guy you'll ever meet\". There followed the relationship with Ron Galotti, the fearsome, Ferrari-fixated New York publisher (and the role model for Mr Big in Sex and the City). Now she's going out with Stephen Morris, a 34-year-old English venture capitalist. When she's not in New York she lives with him in Chelsea. She says they are very happy, may get married, may not, may have kids, may not. Bushnell worked for many years on women's magazines, like Winnie does. Magazines that told their readers if you followed the rules everything would turn out OK. \"If you never eat fat, and you exercise, and any problem that comes up you go to a shrink, and if you decorate your house cheaply but chicly, it's all going to be fine isn't it?\" She says there's an anarchist in her that wanted to scream out it was all a lie. I ask her what gave her greatest satisfaction as a journalist. She mentions two stories she wrote about runaway teenagers and migrant workers. She spent weeks with her subjects, on the streets and in trailer parks. \"The social workers were like, 'Don't sit on their couch, you could get something.' It was like, 'I've got jeans on, I'll sit on the couch.' \" At times she speaks with the shambling eloquence of the girls in the movie Clueless. Although she is most proud of these articles, they are also what made her want to quit journalism. \"The thing about it is, you come in from the outside and befriend these people. They really think they're your friend and you're going to help them down the road, and you're going in as a journalist to do that story and when the story's done you can't continue a relationship with those people. I thought there was something cruel about that. I didn't like it, I just didn't think it was nice.\" She looks embarrassed. \"I know you're not buying that, but it doesn't seem like the right thing to do.\" I do buy it. Bushnell orders a Coke and lights yet another fag. \"You're not gonna get all hyper again are you?\" joshes the waiter. \"I'm like one of those hyperactive kids - don't give him sugar!\" She talks about people we know in America, and her publicist, and the journalist she's just seen. She doesn't seem to have a bad word for any of them. I start muttering, ineptly, about how she understands ghastly people so well, and I was wondering... She finishes the sentence for me. \"Oh, you mean am I one?\" Again, she says she doesn't think the people she satirises are truly horrible. \"I think they're behaving in the way that people do in certain circumstances. Most people are easily swayed by the circumstances they are in.\" Bushnell says she couldn't write a book like Sex and the City now. \"In my mid-30s I was much more absorbed by men.\" At the time she wanted to realistically depict the sex lives of single women in New York, but all that has been lost on television. \"In the TV series they go out and meet a different guy every week. That just doesn't happen to most women. I have some girl friends who'd go to a party and they'd met a footballer or something and they'd have sex with him in a closet, and I was always, 'Oh my God! How could you do that!' Like a mixture of 'gosh, that's really brave' and 'that's really slutty'.\" She never did that? \"No. I'm not like that. I couldn't. I'm too conservative. That's so not me. I actually couldn't do that.\" She says she dabbled with cocaine at Studio 54 in her younger days, but that's about it. \"I'm very conservative. I don't necessarily dress conservatively.\" She looks at her thighs. \"I think my skirt is a bit inappropriately short.\" But it does go down well on book tours. \"Now I mostly wear pants.\" So where did she find her gallery of vile creatures? \"There was this time in the late 80s and there was this excess and everyone was going mad, and people were pretty nasty to each other.\" Is she talking about the likes of Brett Easton Ellis and his literary brat pack? She looks shocked. \"No, they were probably the nice ones. He's a doll. Other people. I think the meanest people are people in their late 20s and early 30s. They're so judgmental and they're mean to each other, not very forgiving. And I was around this group of people where they were all shagging each other and taking ecstasy and doing all this stuff, and I just loved to hear about it but I didn't really want to do it.\" She pauses. \"Ever since I was a kid I realised I'm one of those people who will run to the edge of the cliff with everyone else and then I'll watch them jump off. I won't jump off, but others will.\" Bushnell hasn't finished her Coke. Her PR says we have to wind up because the News of the World is waiting to take her round town in a stretch limo. A stretch Saab. She'll have to lie on the back seat and make the most of her legs. \"Let me just warn you they have two champagne flutes. I said you had an upset stomach and you might not drink any,\" the PR says. It's the last thing she feels like doing, but a book tour is a book tour. \"I'm so depressed,\" Bushnell says. \"I might throw up on them.\"",

      "bodyText": "Movie portal iFilm has picked up \u00a36.9m in financial support from a band of investors that includes Yahoo!, Sony Pictures and Kodak. It is the second time Sony and Kodak have invested in the company. iFilm showcases short films and provides support to the independent film industry. Sony's investment means the portal is likely to become a key content provider for Sony's planned broadband entertainment initiative, due to launch in May. Yahoo!'s involvement will mean iFilm's library of short films will be added to Yahoo!, boosting its entertainment site. Former Microsoft heavyweight Paul Allen has also reinvested in iFilm through his investment vehicle Vulcan Ventures. Mr Allen was also involved in the now defunct Pop.com, which was wound up in September after merger talks with iFilm collapsed. Pop.com investors Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard have since made internet films for a new website called Countingdown.com. A number of other high-profile online film and broadcast ventures have suffered setbacks recently. Icebox.com, for example, has been forced to make a number of redundancies and cutbacks. The problems have largely been attributed to the immaturity of the market for broadcasting short and animated films over the web. However, this fresh round of funding from such heavyweight backers suggests the online broadcast market is more stable than it was a year ago. iFilm claims it is already changing the rules of filmmaking by giving directors a free, global showcase for their work. The \"success stories\" section of iFilm.com lists 17 filmmakers that have been discovered by Hollywood and have won critical acclaim. Launched in October 1998, iFilm now contains links to more than 15,000 internet films. An iFilm spokesperson said the new funding would help keep the company afloat but declined to give an estimate of expected profitability.",

The revelation comes the day Asda announced it was rolling out in-store jewellery shops, following the lead of its parent company, US retailing giant Wal-Mart, which has sold jewellery since 1962. In the US Wal-Mart operates what it calls \"tyre and lube\" centres at its stores, which are similar to Kwik-Fit operations, according to an Asda spokeswoman. She said: \"Tyre and lube is the only other thing that the US does and we (the UK) don't. It is something we are looking at to decide whether to go into it. \"But there are no plans to launch tyre and lube in the UK at present.\" Asda has created a new speciality division looking after the jewellery, photo, optical and pharmacy areas and innovations such as tyre and lube. Speciality division head David Miles has approached watch manufacturers such as Calvin Klein about stocking their brands in Asda's jewellery shops, but has been turned down by at least one. Swatch told Miles that its watches had \"attitude\" and needed to be sold in an appropriate environment. Asda says it is more interested in value than attitude and will source designer watches on the grey market. Asda is persistent in its use of the grey market for a variety of products, from fragrances to household cleaners. Tesco went to the European Court of Justice in January for its right to sell cut-price Levi jeans against the manufacturer's wishes. The case, which has taken two years to reach court, is seen as a test of whether makers of luxury products can dictate where and how their brands are sold.

      "body": "<p>Fancy getting Oliver Stone to direct one of your commercials? Or how about Hugh Hudson? Maybe even Dennis Hopper or Anjelica Huston or, just imagine, Woody Allen. </p> <p>For decades UK advertising agencies have been hiring celebrities to star in their ads - everyone from top-flight footballers to the shiniest of supermodels and hot new TV chefs. But, as of this week, agencies will be more readily able to access big-name Hollywood directors to make the ads themselves. </p> <p>A new company is being launched which aims to link celebrity directorial talent with British agencies for one-off advertising projects. The company, called Top Dog, is the creation of RSA Films, the TV commercials arm of the directorial giants Ridley and Tony Scott. </p> <p>Between them, the Scott brothers have made numerous award-winning commercials for Orange, Barclays, Foster's and Apple, as well as feature films ranging from Thelma and Louise, Blade Runner and Alien to Gladiator and the upcoming Hannibal. But now they are going to harness their power in Hollywood for the benefit, or otherwise, of the British commercials market. </p> <p>Adrian Harrison, the managing director of RSA Films, explains: \"We have always been seen as a form of conduit with Hollywood because of Ridley's and Tony's connections - between them they know everyone over there. We often just seem to get the calls when agencies want to access celebrity directors as well as certain stars in front of the cameras, so we are now formalising that and capitalising on it.\" </p> <p>In addition to being able to tap into the wealth of the Scott brothers' fancy contacts, Top Dog will also benefit from being run by Kate Driver, the older sister of the actress Minnie. An experienced commercials as well as features producer based in Los Angeles, Driver frequents the sort of social gatherings that boast the biggest of celebrity guests from the film industry. </p> <p>Demand for the use of top directors has certainly been growing. At the end of last year Trevor Beattie, executive creative director of TBWA, solicited the help of the famously weird David Lynch to direct the launch commercial for Sony's PlayStation 2. The ambitious Barclays \"big\" ads of last year, featuring Sir Anthony Hopkins, Tim Roth and Robbie Coltrane, were all directed by Tony Scott himself, while Allen has just been used to film an ad for Telecom Italia (in which he also stars) and Hudson has filmed Nelson Mandela for Unicef. </p> <p>Leagas Delaney creative director Tim Delaney, who hired Tony Scott to direct the Barclays ads, comments: \"You just don't get that polished look from commercials directors. Tony makes features like commercials. There is a real attention to detail and to the fact that you've got to cram a lot of story-telling in. The Barclays ads were immaculate films, and the whole experience was fantastic.\" </p> <p>To hire a \"celebrity\" director need not be prohibitively expensive. Commercials directors are paid pretty handsomely anyway (anything between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000 per shoot day for an average UK director) so the extra expense of using a big name, at an estimated cost of between \u00a317,000 to \u00a323,000 per day, might not seem too lavish. And if you are already shelling out for a top model or some famous talent then it is possibly a good insurance policy to hire a director of similar stature. </p> <p>In addition, the spin-off PR could alleviate the expense, if not generate extra media coverage way beyond that which could have been achieved without the star name. Beattie secured enviable column inches for his PlayStation commercial, for instance, regardless of whether it was any good or whether Lynch's involvement made any difference to the average viewer. </p> <p>But celebrity directors have also become big names for a reason: they are talented film-makers, often known for a particular look or style. While you obviously wouldn't bring in Stone to do a table-top (adspeak for static, studio-based commercial with endless close-ups of food products), you might well want him if you are going after an ambitious, cast-of-thousands filmic look. </p> <p>Delaney adds: \"If you use a celebrity director you've got to want them to express themselves. You've got to let them go and you must be bringing them in for the right reasons - you have to buy the talent, not the name.\" </p> <p>Perhaps most useful of all, though, is that celebrity directors can oil the negotiations for securing celebrity names in front of the camera. Just as stars can be picky about who does their make-up and hair, so they can fuss over who is going to be ultimately responsible for how they appear on film. In short, if you want a big name you've often got to have a big director. </p> <p>Harrison of RSA comments: \"Tony [Scott] got Anthony Hopkins for Barclays and he also recently filmed Marlon Brando in another commercial. Marlon only agreed to do it because he was going to be directed by an A-list director. A jobbing English director would probably either not have got him in the first place, or else would have been eaten alive.\" Driver is now busily signing up hefty names for Top Dog. So far she has bagged, among others, Huston, Stone, Hudson, Roth, Diane Keaton and Gary Oldman, but others will follow. </p> <p>You may wonder what's in it for the likes of such premier league Hollywood talent to dip their toes in the grubby world of UK commercials, but they seem to be queuing up. </p> <p>A major attraction is the relatively luxurious experience of having three whole days to film just one minute, instead of the average feature film shooting-pace of four to five minutes a day. Another is that doing a commercial can keep the directors busy and give them the buzz of being behind a camera in between film projects. </p> <p>\"I have a wish list and I have zoned in on people I think would make the transition,\" says Driver. \"We've already got a varied list of directors, some of whom are good at dialogue, some action, some really offbeat. All of them are proven as directors, if not necessarily commercials directors, but a lot of directors have made the transition and a commercial is really just a mini-movie anyway.\" </p> <p>Indeed, RSA is not alone in signing up heavyweights. Anthony Minghella, who directed and adapted The English Patient, has been signed to the Paul Weiland Film Company for several years, while Guy Ritchie has just signed to the same company (possibly prompted by his advertising creative father, John). The Waking Ned director Kirk Jones has recently signed to Tomboy Films. </p> <p>It may well not be plain sailing, however, and some wonder whether Hollywood can hack it over here. They criticise features directors for wanting to shoot \"big\" all the time and for not knowing enough about concentrated story-telling, while availability will be a problem as well as the vagaries of the UK advertising scene. </p> <p>\"I'm under no illusions. It's a two-way process because not only will it be about educating agencies on how to use these directors, we've also got to educate the directors themselves about the process of British advertising,\" cautions Harrison. </p> <p>Hopefully it will all work nicely, though. And maybe punters can look forward with relish to the prospect of Francis Ford Coppola doing a nice pasta sauce commercial, or a wide-boy cockney heist ad for De Beers filmed by Ritchie.

Variety quotes an inside source as complaining that a new president may throw the balance of the entire jury out and force a major overhaul of this year's festival. \"It's a real pain,\" the source said.",

They are the twin solstices of Hollywood's teen release schedule: the idyllic, hand-holding noontime of young love versus the black midnight of onrushing death and the lately upraised legions of the damned. But love's no fun without the spectre of death lurking somewhere; likewise, death is more fun when you season it with a little exploitative sex. </p> <p>So elements of the Valentine's Day movie and the Halloween movie are always seeping from one to the other and back again. The hack'n'slash boom of the late 1970s, inaugurated by John Carpenter's Halloween, not only dripped with inventively disgorged plasma and viscera, it fairly hummed with teenage hormones and libidinal turmoil. Sadly, the price of teen tumescence usually meant being impaled on a portcullis or a weathervane before you got those post-orgasmic fags lit. Your average drippy Love Story knock-off, on the other hand, sees young love stalked by encroaching death, usually in the form of a disease with no discernible symptoms, since romance tends to wilt somewhat when you introduce chemo or amputation or open-heart surgery to the mix. </p> <p>Although Valentine's Day is still nine days away, the studios are already chasing its teen adher ents with all the vigour of the Hallmark Greeting Card Company. Next week sees the arrival of the Love Story variant on the theme - Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron in Sweet November - but the horror variant, Valentine, opened this weekend. </p> <p>I freely confess I'm a well-adjusted child of the 1970s hack'n'slash generation. Our idols were George Romero, Tobe Hooper, early Wes Craven, make-up supremo Tom Savini, Carpenter, and Sean Cunningham, father of the Friday the 13th franchise. Our benchmark movies were Dawn of the Dead, Last House on the Left, Prom Night and Black Christmas. Our nightmares teemed with entrail-hungry zombies, heads split by axes, nubile girls fleeing large men with buzzsaws or electric turkey knives, and teenage unknowns like Kevin Bacon getting harpoons shoved through their throats. We didn't think much of Scream - too clever by half. The genre needed its innate dumbness to flourish; it needed all the tireless sexism and grand guignol violence that the film-makers could muster, just to pack all those beautiful, long-gone drive-in theatres. </p> <p>It says something for my high expectations that I felt compelled to rewatch the entirely unremarkable 1980 Canadian horror flick My Bloody Valentine as preparation. Well, Valentine wasn't fit to kiss the blood off My Bloody Valentine's hands, frankly. It's neither violent enough nor scary enough, so what's the point? Worse, it's incoherent, presumably thanks to extensive test screenings and the crude palmprints of no less than four writers. And none of them noticed they'd more or less rewritten National Lampoon's Class Reunion, another terrible movie. </p> <p>It's the familiar story of jilted high school love producing a string of grisly murders many years later. The story isn't strong enough to survive without some leering, gratuitous nudity or a few eyeballs on skewers, and neither are there any satiric ambitions to enhance it. </p> <p>One of its co-stars, Marley Shelton, also appears in the most likable movie out now, Sugar and Spice, about a group of cheerleaders who start robbing banks. It's pitched at the same teen demographic as Valentine, but seems to understand its mindset: it's filled with adorably dumb and innocent characters, but never sneers at them. Valentine doesn't exactly patronise its characters, but it certainly patronises its targeted ticket-buyers. </p> <p>The other teen outing this week was Head Over Heels, starring Freddie Prinze Jr and a quartet of airhead supermodels. Prinze's father, comedian Freddie Sr, was one of the first Latino stars on US TV in the early 1970s, before he blew his brains out in a maelstrom of coke and Lenny Bruce delusions. Freddie Jr isn't associated with the Latino boom of the late 1990s, despite his family connections, and his handlers have pitched him as just another deracinated white boy. He makes the kind of movies you'd expect: anaemic romantic comedies for the Britney Spears fanbase. </p> <p>In limited release, we have Wim Wenders' The Million Dollar Hotel, an almost unwatchable aesthetic catastrophe. Wenders was once an idol of mine - right up until the last 10 minutes of Wings of Desire. For me, his Kings of the Road, The American Friend and The State of Things have always been desert island movies: elliptical, beautifully shot, and teeming with ideas. Back then Wenders was working with serious writers like Peter Handke and Robert Kramer; The Million Dollar Hotel is based on an idea by Bono. </p> <p>It's another stage in the seemingly unstoppable decline of one of the world's great manipulators of celluloid - grim evidence of what hanging out with too many colourless rock stars will do.

Maybe it's the lure of Hollywood glamour or the romanticism of a night in front of the telly with popcorn and Humphrey Bogart that makes it all seem a little more classy than your average digital channel conception. </p> <p>Certainly that's the image that the men and women behind Vivendi-Universal's new venture, The Studio, would like to project. It's a \"movie channel for movie lovers\", says its movie-loving boss, Janet Goldsmith. </p> <p>The Studio launched in a blaze of publicity (well, a hurriedly-organised party in east London) last Thursday. It certainly looked like a classy project - full of background report shows, film news programmes and \"personal view\" inserts between the films. All, says Goldsmith, to give the channel \"a context\". So, not to pad out the films, then. Never mind that the first movie to be screened was the sickly children's feature Babe, this is an intelligent channel for a broad audience, we are told. </p> <p>Goldsmith is keen to stress that The Studio will have a universal appeal. \"This is not a channel for buffs, it is a channel for movie lovers,\" she says again. \"It will have the best films, new and old, put into context for the audience and well-scheduled.\" </p> <p>The problem is that not very many people can watch it at the moment. The Studio has secured a carriage deal only with NTL - and while the channel boasts that this gives it access to 2.2m viewers, the fact is that The Studio really needs to be on Sky Digital if it is to have any hope of making an impact. Otherwise, say some analysts, it is destined for the same division as Carlton Cinema rather than the Sky Digital premier league. </p> <p>Executives at The Studio deny that the lack of a deal with Sky is a problem. They are in negotiations with all carriers, and hope to conclude deals soon. The problem is that Sky is in no hurry to carry a basic-package competitor to its cash-generating premium channel offerings. </p> <p>Carriage deals notwithstanding, Universal believes that its new venture - which has already been launched in France and Italy - will be a winner in Britain. Certainly, it is a new way of offering movies, as it is the first general movie channel to be launched directly by a mainstream Hollywood studio. </p> <p>Until now, the movie moguls have concentrated on selling their products to pay-TV networks such as Sky; channels such as The Studio, the theory goes, should change the face of the film channel market, forcing pay-TV suppliers to settle for deals that are more advantageous to the big film distributors. </p> <p>But there appears to be an inherent contradiction in the idea. Universal cannot simply stop doing deals with pay-TV operators and terrestrial networks because these operators dominate the viewing market. There is no chance that Universal will cut off its own lifeblood by signing over all its blockbusters to its own TV channel. The Studio, consequently, must conclude deals with other distributors to shore up its offering. </p> <p>Universal's president of acquisitions, Graeme Mason, rejects the suggestion that launching a film network, while continuing to deal with pay-TV networks and terrestrial channels, is a contradictory business proposition. \"I don't think the two positions are mutually exclusive. We will continue to do deals with Sky, and the terrestrial channels. At the moment, we have films running on BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4, and that will continue.\" The film distribution business will operate at \"arm's length\" from the television channel, he says. </p> <p>Mason identifies a broader aim, saying that the channel will help increase the audiences for film, not just on multi-channel television, but in cinemas too, which would be to the commercial advantage of everyone. \"We want to take advantage of people's interest in film. Last year saw a 28-year box office high in British cinemas. If this helps to increase the level of interest in cinema, then that's good for Universal as a whole,\" he says. </p> <p>Observers believe that the key to The Studio's success will be the quality of films that it offers to viewers. At the moment, the channel has a bank of 1,500 films that will be shown in the next three years - which, if you think about it, is little more than two a day. Goldsmith says, however, that deals are being concluded all the time, and the film bank balance will be significantly boosted. </p> <p>The movies on offer at the moment include In the Name of the Father, Mona Lisa, 1492, True Lies, Chaplin, The Meaning of Life, Carlito's Way and Lord of the Flies. All quality stuff, then. There will be a contemporary blockbuster every night at 9pm - later than the traditional time of 8pm, which Goldsmith and Mason believe to be too early for most people to \"commit\" to a film - and themed scheduling. Sunday, for example, will be family day. But what does contemporary mean? \"Post-1970,\" says Goldsmith. One wonders whether re-runs of Rollerball will be quite what viewers regard as contemporary - but Goldsmith denies that the Studio will be a film equivalent of \"gold\" radio. \"This is not a nostalgia channel,\" she says. </p> <p>Goldsmith insists that plans for the channel are ambitious, but concedes that she is in a tough game. FilmFour, for example, is finding it hard going, losing \u00a320m in 1999 and not expecting to break even until 2003. And the competition is about to intensify, with the launch of more FilmFour channels. It was announced on Friday that FilmFourWorld, a channel devoted to foreign language films, and FilmFour Extreme, featuring more controversial films, will launch in April. </p> <p>\"It is very difficult to stand out in this market, you have to build a strong brand,\" says Goldsmith. \"With the multi-channel audience, the trick is to address the audiences at the relvant parts of the day. You need a schedule that is defined, and easy to navigate. And it's very important to deliver a simple, clear message to the audience.\" </p> <p>Goldsmith says that the NTL deal - the cable operator is a major investor - is an indicator of confidence. \"We convinced NTL that this was worth investing in, and that was no mean feat,\" she says. But Universal is in it for the long game. \"Building a success of something, that takes a long time. But we aim to spend the first year really trying to make it work. We will take risks, and not everything is going to work, but there are so many areas to explore.\"</p>",

It was announced on Friday that FilmFourWorld, a channel devoted to foreign language films, and FilmFour Extreme, featuring more controversial films, will launch in April. \"It is very difficult to stand out in this market, you have to build a strong brand,\" says Goldsmith. \"With the multi-channel audience, the trick is to address the audiences at the relvant parts of the day. You need a schedule that is defined, and easy to navigate. And it's very important to deliver a simple, clear message to the audience.\" Goldsmith says that the NTL deal - the cable operator is a major investor - is an indicator of confidence. \"We convinced NTL that this was worth investing in, and that was no mean feat,\" she says. But Universal is in it for the long game. \"Building a success of something, that takes a long time. But we aim to spend the first year really trying to make it work. We will take risks, and not everything is going to work, but there are so many areas to explore.\"",

Mr Lyons had made over 80 individual complaints about the one article - and the PCC threw out all except one of them, which it said was \"not significant\". The letter on the PCC's decision sent to Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian, is reproduced below:<br><br></p> <p>Sir,</p> <p>I write further to Ms Namdjou's letter of 8 December as the Commission has now considered the complaint from MSF and Roger Lyons. The objections raised were reviewed within the context of the article as a whole, taking into consideration the requirements of the Code of Practice.</p> <p>After review the Commission has decided that no matters have been raised which show a breach of the code. Its more detailed reasons are as follows:</p> <p>The Commission noted that the complainants had made a number of specific allegations of inaccuracy about the article, but that at its heart the complaint was an objection to a perceived implication that the union was in financial difficulty and that it was faced with taking drastic measures to avert a crisis.</p> <p>The Commission is not in a position, and does not seek, to be able to discern the facts of a matter behind a newspaper article, but is rather charged with ascertaining whether material has been obtained and published in accordance with the Code of Practice. Clause 1 of the Code requires, among other things, publications to 'take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted material' and also to distinguish between comment, conjecture and fact. It also calls for newspapers to correct 'significant' inaccuracies.</p> <p>It appeared to the Commission that your newspaper largely had material on which to base the allegations contained in the article. The minutes of the numerous meetings of the GPFC seemed to confirm the involvement of the accountants in discussing options for making large savings between 2001-2003 and recorded that following a presentation to the GPFC there had been a discussion about how such savings could be achieved. While the complainants maintained that this did not amount to an 'emergency savings package' such a description was clearly your newspaper's view of the matter, as was the term 'unpalatable' to describe the options before the union. The precise time at which the proposals had been discussed was not in the context of the article a matter of significance under the Code. Similarly, complaints relating to whether or not the report could be considered to be confidential, or even a 'report', were not matters of significance.</p> <p>The minutes (of the meeting on 21 September 2000) had also recorded that all necessary action was to be taken 'to curb expenditure to reduce any end of year deficit to the minimum' and the accountants' indication that there would be a deficit for the year of \u00a3400,000. While the complaints had objected to some of the language used to describe the union's financial position by your newspaper, the Commission concluded that your paper had grounds to justify its description of the situation.</p> <p>It was also clear - and both parties accepted - that the journalist had confidential sources from which he had obtained further information. It was the Commission's job to establish the veracity of the claims made by such sources - upon which the journalist had based some of the claims in the article - but it considered that in the context of the rest of the article and the available on the record evidence that the complainants had not established that the presentation of the material obtained from sources was a breach of the Code. Such claims included the remark of a senior officer that the union was facing a financial crisis; the suggestion that property might have to be sold; the suggestion that staff cuts were being proposed and the statement that the scrapping of a number of initiatives had been discussed. Although the union had another view of whether such proposals had in fact been discussed, the Commission noted that the article had not said that the proposals were anything other than 'options' that had been 'discussed'. It was your newspaper's case that such discussions may not have been minuted or had been discussed outside the GPFC and the Commission could not see any way of resolving the different positions of the parties, given that they rested on assertion and counter-assertion and not any firm evidence.</p> <p>Regarding the complaint about the union's position on the website, the Commission noted that while no legal action was now planned the union had sought legal advice about the site but that the advice was that nothing could be done. The Commission therefore found no breach of the Code in the article's statement that 'lawyers are also being asked to take action to close down [the] website'. Neither did the Commission consider that a breach of the Code had been established concerning the reporting of the cost of employment cases; your newspaper had shown how it had arrived at its figure of \u00a3900,000 and there appeared to have been a number of settlements resulting in the union paying out significant sums of money to individuals. Although these settlements may not literally have followed tribunals nor involved admissions of liability there appeared to be no doubt that they had been made and the Commission did not consider that there was a material inaccuracy in referring to them as 'employment tribunal cases'.</p> <p>The Commission noted the complainants' position that the reference to a projected increase in pensions contribution from 6% to 19% had been based on the possibility that the payments holiday would end and that this was by no means certain to happen. However, as your paper had pointed out, the figures had been included in the minutes which recorded that one of the key issues that had to be addressed by the union was that \"by the end of the forward projection period set out in the presentation, the pension fund contributions 'holiday' may not apply, necessitating a rise in contributions from 6% to 19%\". In light of the inclusion of these precise figures in the minutes and the assertion that it was a key issue that required consideration by the union the Commission did not consider that there was any material inaccuracy in the reference to the pension contributions in the article.</p> <p>There did appear to be an accepted inaccuracy relating to the monthly surplus in 1999 but this was not considered by the Commission to be so significant, in the context of the article as a whole, to require material under the Code.</p> <p>The Commission noted finally that the article had quoted Paul Talbot, the secretary to the GPFC, saying that the measures amounted merely to good housekeeping.

Fourteen percent of the sample of 3,100 people interviewed between October and December 2000 said they had suffered from vomiting or diarrhoea, which they felt could be attributed to food.

But people's attitudes tell us nothing about the realities of hygiene in any of these places. Above all, it doesn't tell us how many food poisoning cases are caused by the food-producing or food-retailing part of the food chain, and how much is caused by filthy habits at home. The FSA may well argue that the research is only into consumer attitudes, not into fact. The trouble is that the way the data is presented, it is treated as fact. A year ago, I attended a conference of paediatric gastro-enterologists, the people who have to deal with the effects of diet on children. One of the startling pieces of information that came out of it is how many of the poisoning cases are caused by the fact that our systems are no longer resistant to even quite mild bugs because food production is now so hygienic. Indeed, so concerned are the authorities in Sweden, that cleanest of clean countries, that they have been experimenting with inoculating children with tiny amounts of E coli bacteria to stimulate the development of infant immune systems. The remotely controversial piece of information in the rest of the survey is that it confirms the low incidence of vegetarianism in the UK only 5% of the sample admitted to having a vegetarian in the house, although 7% include someone who is \"mainly vegetarian\", whatever that may mean. This leaves 93% of the population staunchly carnivorous, which may come as something of a surprise given the disproportionate amount of space devoted to vegetarian eating in the media. Indeed, reading the report in full merely confirms how resistant the British are to advice from well-meaning bodies. Our eating habits are as atrocious as they ever were, if for contemporary reasons. We still eat too much fat, sugar and things that are bad for us, and too little fruit, veg and the things that are good for us. The difference from, say, ten or 15 years ago, is that we cook very little of this food ourselves, but buy it ready-made, packed with fat, sugar, air, water and those chemicals beloved of the food manufacturing industry. In fact, the FSA report, for all its spelling out of contemporary concerns, merely confirms that we are, as we have always been when it comes to food matters, dirty, dishonest and lazy.

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabian television viewers last night saw three westerners confess to two car bombings which killed a Briton and injured several others. Alexander Mitchell, from Britain, said the three men had been obeying orders when they carried out the two blasts in the Saudi capital Riyadh, but did not say who had given the orders. Human rights watchdogs have expressed concern about the confessions, which are thought to follow lengthy detentions. The first car bomb attack, on November 17 last year, killed Christopher Rodway, 47, from Gloucestershire, and injured his wife, Jane, 50. Five days later a second blast injured three Britons and an Irish woman working for the Boeing-owned Al-Salam aircraft company. In the broadcast, Mr Mitchell said that he had carried out the attacks in collaboration with William Sampson from Canada, and Raf Schifter, from Belgium. According to an Arabic voiceover of his remarks, Mr Mitchell said: \"I confirm and confess that I received orders to carry out the bombing here in Riyadh on November 17 against Christopher Rodway, a British citizen. William Sampson, a Canadian, helped me carry out the bombing.\" The three men all confessed to involvement, pointing to street maps as they explained how they had set a device in Rodway's car before following him and detonating the explosive by remote control. Saudi interior minister Prince Nayef said before the broadcast that the kingdom knew who was behind the bombings and would reveal further details at a later stage. He added that diplomats from the three countries had visited the men in custody. Stephen Jakobi, director of the campaign group Fair Trials Abroad, said there were serious doubts about the validity of the confessions obtained by the Saudi authorities. \"We are not aware how long these three have been in custody and there has been a long row about lack of access to British prisoners,\" he said. \"Standard operating technique in Saudi is to beat prisoners until a confession has been obtained.

The other new entry into the top ten was Head Over Heels, a teen drama starring Freddie Prinze Jr which hit number seven with opening weekend takings of $5m (\u00a33.39m) and has already been judged a failure for the young star.",

Then in November, India said that it would suspend military operations against the militants in Indian Kashmir for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. That ceasefire has now been extended for the third month, and in return, Pakistan has promised to exercise \"maximum restraint\" on the so-called line of control, the ceasefire line which divides Kashmir. Of course, the winter months are the season for diplomacy in Kashmir. Freezing temperatures and heavy snow on the mountains make it much harder for militants to cross into Indian Kashmir, and much more gruelling for the soldiers of the Indian and Pakistani armies, who, until the latest ceasefire, were shelling each other every day. The last rapprochement between the two sides was in February 1999, when Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif met Mr Vajpayee in Lahore and both promised a new era of peace and negotiations. Within three months, the snow in Kashmir had melted and the fighting began again in the Kargil heights, almost pushing the countries into yet another war. Now Pakistan is pushing New Delhi to grant passports and visas to Kashmiri political leaders from the All Parties Hurriyat conference, so they can travel to Islamabad for talks on the area's future. Huge problems lie ahead. Islamabad still wants Kashmir to be part of Pakistan, but many Kashmiris would rather rule themselves under a degree of independence from India. Pakistan cannot risk the wrath of its own religious right by withdrawing support for the militants fighting in Kashmir. \"Clearly there is a nexus between the political and the military struggle,\" said Mr Sattar. \"Involvement of the people of Kashmir in a political process is the answer to a reduction of militancy.\" Pakistan is today marking a day of solidarity with those opposing Indian rule in Kashmir. Flags with the words \"Kashmir - Picture of Indian inhumanity\" and \"India stop state terrorism in Kashmir\" line the streets of Islamabad. The general and the prime minister have had their first telephone call. Many more must follow.

The multibillion dollar company is ensuring it will not have to pay customers a penny for their ideas, even if they prove to be hugely successful. Instead, P&amp;G will keep all the profits for itself. The company has set up interactive areas on its website for customers' feedback on how to improve existing products and ideas for new products or services which P&amp;G could use. The information is being used by P&amp;G's marketing and product development teams. In the new product idea area customers are encouraged to click on one of four statements including \"I wish someone would invent a product to...\" and \"I have a great idea for a product\". But before they can join put forward their idea, customers must click in two boxes on an agreement document that binds them to the terms and conditions waiving all rights to their ideas and suggestions forever. The agreement document states: \"P&amp;G shall be entitled to unrestricted use of any submissions it may receive from you, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to you as a provider of the submission.\" The area for improving products asks consumers to help with marketing. For example, under the question for the Pampers brand \"If you were in charge, how would you sell more Pampers?\" there are a list of statements to be agreed or disagreed with. One of the statements says: \"I would run a contest like Pepsi and other companies do with their products. Their payoff would be a year's supply of free diapers.

      "bodyText": "German media giant Bertelsmann has tightened its grip on Channel 5 owner RTL in a surprise all-share deal. Bertelsmann today bought a 30% stake in RTL from Belgium's Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, taking its holding in the pan-European broadcaster to 67% In exchange, GBL will take a 25% stake in Bertelsmann, which it can float within three to five years. It would be an unprecedented move for Bertelsmann to launch on the stock market, as it has always been a private business. \"All parties involved agree that Bertelsmann has found a ground-breaking new way to adjust to changing conditions and to use its own shares as a acquisition currency, while still retaining entrepreneurial independence,\" said Bertelsmann in a statement. The family-owned group had always intended to take a majority holding in the publicly listed RTL, which last year merged with Pearson TV and floated on the London Stock Exchange. RTL, which started out as Luxembourg's broadcaster, runs 22 TV stations and 18 radio stations in 11 countries. Pearson continues to own 22% of RTL. \"It simplifies the shareholding structure of RTL Group and further strengthens our working relationship with Bertelsmann,\" said Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of Pearson group. A partial flotation will allow Bertelsmann to use its shares for acquisitions, after the group was stung by criticism that it lacked flexibility in executing deals. Although the German group signalled that today's announcement meant the end of its activity in the TV sector for the time being, there may be further consolidation around the corner. RTL has made clear that it wants to acquire United Business Media's 35% holding in Channel 5, which would cost it up to \u00a3350m. A firming up of RTL's share structure will increase the pressure on United, which is looking to quit broadcasting altogether, to sell its holding. \"RTL Group's clear focus is to strengthen its unique position as Europe's leading broadcasting and production company,\" said Didier Bellens, chief executive of RTL. Bertelsmann is a multi-media powerhouse, with significant interests in TV music, internet and publishing, including Bertelsmann Music Group and BOL.",

      "bodyText": "The first series of Kay Mellor's Fat Friends, one of the most star-studded dramas of recent times, is to be the last. The cast included Alison Steadman, Josie Lawrence, Meera Syal, Thelma Barlow, Ruth Jones and Ms Mellor's daughter Gaynor Faye. The series focused on a group of Yorkshire women struggling to shed the pounds at a weight-watchers club. A source close to Ms Mellor said the screenwriter would not create another series because she had \"said all she wants to say on the subject\". The news has come as a blow to ITV, which wanted to run another series of the hit show. Fat Friends pulled in huge ratings and was considered to be one of ITV's key weapons in its ratings war with the BBC. \"ITV definitely wanted another series, but Kay felt she had gone as far as she could with the characters and is now busy doing other things,\" said a TV source. The series was a massive hit with audiences of up to 10m for the last episode of the last series in November. Women in particular - and all those accustomed to the pendulum of weight loss and weight gain - lapped up Ms Mellor's tales of the lardy lasses at a northern slimming club. Critics marvelled at the down-to-earth script packed with one-liners. As one critic said: \"It didn't mock the calorifically-challenged. Much. It didn't preach at all. \"The women's desperation to shed pounds was matched by acute self-awareness.\" In one episode Gaynor Faye, who played a weight-obsessed actress called Lauren, moaned that everybody in The Bill and Casualty had tiny little bums. \"And telly makes you 10lbs heavier!\" she sighed. \"Oh, my God!

      "body": "<p>Michael Portillo must be surprised. His rehashed plans to privatise Channel 4 went down like a lead balloon last week, provoking the Daily Mail of all papers to point to all its wonderful programmes and snap: \"Keep your hands off.\" </p> <p>The truth is that the critics circling around Channel 4 are no longer \"shocked of Tunbridge Wells\" but a range of jealous commercial broadcasters. They recognise, however, that privatisation is off the agenda while Labour forms the government. So they are pointing instead to a \"complete muddle\" about what this public service broadcaster is supposed to be doing. They accuse it of abusing a privileged position by lavishly funding pure commercial ventures such as FilmFour and the new E4, which is affluent enough to showcase fresh series of Friends and ER. </p> <p>David Elstein, ex-chief executive of Channel 5, landed a blow before government ministers last year when he pointed to the \"missing \u00a3250m\" in 4's accounts.(This was the difference between its 1999 total revenue of \u00a3642m and its annual programme budget of \u00a3390m). But behind the scenes Channel 4, led by chief executive Michael Jackson, has spent the past few months cooking up a response to meet objections head on. It will unveil its most fundamental reorganisation since its launch as a single public service channel in 1982. </p> <p>Channel 4 is splitting in two, to create a new 4 Ventures Ltd to handle developments such as E4. The two arms will have separate accounts, which will also make it much easier for it to fund joint ventures with new partners. New channels and commercial activities - 10 so far but proliferating fast - will go into 4 Ventures; besides E4 and a projected documentary channel, they also include the FilmFour channels, Interactive, FilmFour Ltd and Sport on Four. </p> <p>A related division will handle joint ventures including a Go Racing channel (not due till 2002) with betting, and slam.com (a 50:50 owned teen site in partnership with Emap). Eventually, successful joint ventures could be floated off to crystallise company values, and realise capital gains. \"We have no plans to float 4 Ventures,\" says Jackson. \"But I do not rule out offering shares in the joint ventures and possibly in the whole ... but one thing at a time\". </p> <p>The restructuring will accompany the annual report in April. The report will also, for the first time, state how much Channel 4 is committing to building up new ventures. Last year's sum will be a little below 10% of its total income, now approaching \u00a3700m a year. \"About time too,\" says Peter Ainsworth, shadow Culture, Media &amp; Sports spokesman, of the proposal. \"But this is a defensive mechanism.\" </p> <p>Of the reorganisation, Jackson says calmly: \"It's a natural response, much like the BBC's, to a changing world where a single channel strategy is no longer appropriate for our audience or for the market. It's a natural evolution. </p> <p>\"It's about transparency. It is important to understand we are protecting and ring-fencing our investment in Channel 4 [where programme budgets will be rising], not weakening it.\" Has he modelled the plans on BBC Worldwide? \"Not really, but it is illuminating that the BBC is doing these things. It's pretty universal\". </p> <p>4 Ventures will have its own managing director to pull all the new developments together. Headhunters are currently canvassing, and an appointment will be made in the next three months. One key requirement: he or she must be entrepreneurial. </p> <p>Even those sympathetic to Channel 4 say the changes, in the name of clarity, are overdue, that the relationship should have been sorted out when FilmFour was launched in 1998 - though in fairness FilmFour was an experimental toe dipped in the digital water. (In retrospect it had a deceptively easy launch, encouraged by BSkyB - which subsequently found E4 more threatening). </p> <p>\"They have built a strong brand in FilmFour, but their budget of up to \u00a3100m before breaking even is astonishing. That's four times the cost a commercial operator could commit,\" observes the head of a recently launched rival film channel. </p> <p>Asked about tardiness, Jackson replies that Channel 4 is a small organisation, and that his style is action first rather than bureaucracy. \"It is an appropriate time to be doing this. You can announce your huge vision, then the detail comes later. With us, we launched FilmFour first and tried to work out where next. I am a builder-out. Our strategy has been to take Channel 4 successes and build them across platforms. </p> <p>\"I have to say that some of our critics are our competitors and they don't particularly want to see a strong Channel 4. Look at ITV! Who has done a better job in the new world of multi-channel? Not the red-in-tooth-and-claw capitalists.\" He is proud that FilmFour has won 415,000 subscribers at \u00a35.99 a month - nearly half as many takers as ONdigital's one million. And says that he is convinced it is right to go on investing in internet developments, despite the cold feet of some major players. </p> <p>But will the \"new transparency\" quell the critics? The case against Channel 4 is a mini version of the attacks on the BBC - but with significant differences. As a public service broadcaster, it is there not to make profits but to fund original UK production, so it pays nothing for its spectrum - while ITV and Channel 5 must pay for theirs. It also has a terrestrial channel to use to cross-promote its new channels. The independent television commission has applied pressure for the coming changes after receiving complaints. </p> <p>Nor is Channel 4 judged to have made the public service case for starting E4 as clearly as it might. An ex-Channel 4 insider says: \"I'm surprised. It comes over as very commercial, it looks as if it is taking programmes away from Channel 4. You could easily argue that a place to try out new entertainment formats is exactly what is needed. It is a massive investment of faith to stick some of these things on even late at night on Channel 4\". </p> <p>Adam Singer, chief executive of Flextech/Telewest, which runs a clutch of rival channels, says: \"E4 is going to lose a lot of money in the start up.Why is public money being used to fund a totally commercial channel?\" </p> <p>He is unmoved by the offer of more transparent accounts. \"The answer is that the government should be thinking very carefully about the remit of Channel 4. Either it is a commercial company, or it is a public body. Privatise it, or, if it's there to help British production, then make it spend all that money on much better quality drama, comedy or entertainment. </p> <p>\"Channel 4 is using its money to bid up the cost of rights. Essentially, it is using my money and your money to fund new ventures by avoiding giving money back to the Treasury. I'm in the camp which says, I don't mind what you do but please be clear.\" </p> <p>Jackson flatly denies Channel 4 is being shorn of resources. \"Absolutely not. It's the rational thing to do.\" E4, he says, \"doubles our opportunity to develop new talent.\" </p> <p>In truth, informed critics argue, Channel 4 ought to be able to defuse attacks. It has no direct public funding via a licence fee. As a commercial/public service hybrid, its income comes from advertising and sponsorship. And it is not as vast a media player as the BBC. </p> <p>Yet there are difficulties. What value should be placed on its privileges? What is the public service gain extracted for a free frequency? How is that monitored? And should it be allowed a free hand elsewhere in order to protect its public service remit? </p> <p>There are other complications. Not all of Channel 4's new ventures are expected to be profit-making, so most of its online education service, 4 Learning, is being left with the Channel 4 television division. </p> <p>In the longer term, the channel's business plan says that it faces the same sort of decline as other mainstream terrestrial networks, as the digital explosion causes their collective share of audiences and revenues to fall. Indeed, the hunt is on to find new revenue, to enable the main channel to fire on all guns. It is possible that Channel 4 could be subsidised by its new ventures before 2010, provided the right ones are chosen. Jackson thinks the current model \"of which I'm a big supporter\" can be sustained in the short to medium term. </p> <p>How to strike a fair public interest balance is a question posed by the communications white paper: Channel 4 is being required to draft a more positive statement of programme requirements. The white paper says: \"We will review C4's remit to make it more positive and to ensure [it] provides distinctive and innovative programming in the future.\" Crucially, the phrase requiring it to make programmes for \"tastes and interests not catered for by Channel 3\", is to be struck out, because it is seen as far too negative and old fashioned, benchmarking its performance against ITV. </p> <p>Jackson says the new promises will include \"innovation, distinctiveness\" and, for the first time, a commitment to \"diversity\". Culture secretary Chris Smith, known to be an admirer of Jackson's tenure, says Channel 4 is expected to be \"at the cutting edge of culture, and particularly doing the unusual and quirky. It should be benchmarked against the whole broadcasting industry\", rather than just ITV. </p> <p>On privatisation, Smith said last week: \"There is a very wide consensus [against], the Tory proposal simply got it wrong.\" But as for the grey areas of commercial expansion: \"We have to watch quite carefully what Channel 4 does with the surplus that it makes from its basic Channel 4 services. Channel 4's argument is that FilmFour and E4 will become self-sustaining. We have to hold them to that. </p> <p>\"Having said that, ensuring that the public as a whole sees ER or Friends on free-to-air TV may well be a good piece of public service. We don't want to see them completely corralled into a ghetto. I think on the whole Channel 4 has fulfilled its job pretty well over the last five years.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Broadband Britain is in deep trouble. Over the past two weeks, the politically driven efforts to loosen British Telecom's grip over its local network, seen as the key to wiring the nation's homes for affordable high-bandwidth services, have suffered repeated blows. One by one, some of the company's largest rivals - notably Kingston Communications which had earmarked \u00a31bn - have abandoned plans to install their own equipment in BT exchanges.</p> <p>The government's repeated promises of \"widespread availability\" of broadband services by the summer are now looking increasingly hollow. For those in new media who view broadband as the panacea for their current woes, this is not good news. No matter how whizzbang the applications, without the infrastructure they remain little more than interesting ideas.</p> <p>The break up of BT's monopoly over the so-called \"last mile\" to homes and businesses is vital because it would enable its rivals to install DSL (digital subscriber line) equipment, upgrading the old network of copper wires for broadband use. The argument for breaking up BT's monopoly is that competition will force it to speed up its own investment in the network and, crucially, will lower prices. Welcome to the world, in telecoms jargon, of unbundling the local loop.</p> <p>The process has become steeped in controversy, however. Besides Kingston's withdrawal, last week saw Thus - the renamed Scottish Telecom - shelving plans to build its own network, and two weeks ago Redstone Telecom, another stock market-listed supplier, sharply reduced its investment plans. They join a growing list of companies, including US telecoms giants MCI Worldcom and Global Crossing, dropping their plans to deploy DSL.</p> <p>BT, naturally, is reluctant to give up market share. The alternative is to buy capacity from BT on a wholesale basis, an option currently taken by Video Networks, the video-on-demand company which markets the Home Choice service. </p> <p>Video Networks currently pays BT around \u00a3600 for every customer connected to DSL and another \u00a360 a month per line. Its revenues are less than \u00a330 a customer. If the company can bundle in other services, including multi-channel TV, games, telephony and high speed internet, says chief executive Simon Hochhauser, then the gap could be closed. But for most the sums simply don't add up.</p> <p>BSkyB, which is running a service in Hull with Kingston, providing pay TV and DSL lines, privately admits that the prospect of launching a national service is receding, at least for the time being. A series of things have gone wrong. Some blame can be placed with BT, some with the industry regulator Oftel and a good chunk with the stock and capital markets.</p> <p>The process of unbundling has been painfully protracted. David Edmonds, the Oftel director-general, has described dealing with BT as \"trench warfare\". Decidedly low-tech arguments about how the limited space in exchanges is allocated have rumbled on. Oftel has been accused of going soft on BT and BT has been accused of dragging its feet.</p> <p>Among the issues still to be resolved is BT's insistence that other companies' equipment must be housed in separate rooms in its exchanges. Richard Greco of Bulldog, a DSL company backed by the old British Gas firm Transco, claims the cost of fitting out a room is in the region of \u00a3250,000. Alternatively, BT is proposing to charge \u00a3900 every time a rival company wants access to its own equipment in an exchange. \"We are going forward but are effectively operating on faith, hoping that Oftel will take action over this madness,\" says Greco.</p> <p>The first exchanges to be opened to competition have now been made available. But they have been released in small tranches, drawing complaints that those offered so far are not in lucrative urban areas and are widely dispersed, making it virtually impossible to draw up business plans. The first 25 opened for competition received a derisory response. Orders for space were placed in only 14, with an average of one or two operators per site instead of the anticipated seven or eight.</p> <p>Several weeks ago, Oftel called an emergency meeting at which it pressed BT to bring forward the timetable for offering exchanges and launched an inquiry into the costs for companies wanting space. It didn't stop the likes of Kingston dropping out. The company said the timetable was still too piecemeal to allow development of a viable national network.</p> <p>But perhaps the most significant stumbling block is out of either BT's or Oftel's hands. For Redstone, the decision to retrench and focus on a few towns instead of large parts of the country was due to investors' loss of confidence in the sector. Capital markets have virtually closed to telecoms companies which have borrowed to the hilt over the past two years. </p> <p>Business development director Bob Cushing said Redstone had originally hoped to raise up to \u00a3150m to finance its plans for a national DSL service. As conditions worsened, however, Redstone's advisers warned against taking the debt on. \"The terms aren't attractive, and as we don't urgently need the cash it didn't make sense,\" he says.</p> <p>Ironically, the number of companies pulling out of the process has actually made local loop unbundling more attractive for the remaining few. Less competition for space means it will be easier to build a regional or national network of DSL lines.</p> <p>For many of the media companies developing broadband services there is a need for pragmatism. \"We've always had a strong belief that the timetable would be 18 months or so behind what BT was telling us so we have built that into our business models,\" says John Varney, director of technology at Granada Media. </p> <p>Next month, Granada launches a joint venture with Boots the chemists, which is billed as a broadband business but will operate in effect as a TV channel and sister website until the infrastructure catches up. The future is still coming, but it is further away than many had hoped.</p>",

Over the past two weeks, the politically driven efforts to loosen British Telecom's grip over its local network, seen as the key to wiring the nation's homes for affordable high-bandwidth services, have suffered repeated blows. One by one, some of the company's largest rivals - notably Kingston Communications which had earmarked \u00a31bn - have abandoned plans to install their own equipment in BT exchanges. The government's repeated promises of \"widespread availability\" of broadband services by the summer are now looking increasingly hollow. For those in new media who view broadband as the panacea for their current woes, this is not good news. No matter how whizzbang the applications, without the infrastructure they remain little more than interesting ideas. The break up of BT's monopoly over the so-called \"last mile\" to homes and businesses is vital because it would enable its rivals to install DSL (digital subscriber line) equipment, upgrading the old network of copper wires for broadband use. The argument for breaking up BT's monopoly is that competition will force it to speed up its own investment in the network and, crucially, will lower prices. Welcome to the world, in telecoms jargon, of unbundling the local loop. The process has become steeped in controversy, however. Besides Kingston's withdrawal, last week saw Thus - the renamed Scottish Telecom - shelving plans to build its own network, and two weeks ago Redstone Telecom, another stock market-listed supplier, sharply reduced its investment plans. They join a growing list of companies, including US telecoms giants MCI Worldcom and Global Crossing, dropping their plans to deploy DSL. BT, naturally, is reluctant to give up market share. The alternative is to buy capacity from BT on a wholesale basis, an option currently taken by Video Networks, the video-on-demand company which markets the Home Choice service. Video Networks currently pays BT around \u00a3600 for every customer connected to DSL and another \u00a360 a month per line. Its revenues are less than \u00a330 a customer. If the company can bundle in other services, including multi-channel TV, games, telephony and high speed internet, says chief executive Simon Hochhauser, then the gap could be closed. But for most the sums simply don't add up. BSkyB, which is running a service in Hull with Kingston, providing pay TV and DSL lines, privately admits that the prospect of launching a national service is receding, at least for the time being. A series of things have gone wrong. Some blame can be placed with BT, some with the industry regulator Oftel and a good chunk with the stock and capital markets. The process of unbundling has been painfully protracted. David Edmonds, the Oftel director-general, has described dealing with BT as \"trench warfare\". Decidedly low-tech arguments about how the limited space in exchanges is allocated have rumbled on. Oftel has been accused of going soft on BT and BT has been accused of dragging its feet. Among the issues still to be resolved is BT's insistence that other companies' equipment must be housed in separate rooms in its exchanges. Richard Greco of Bulldog, a DSL company backed by the old British Gas firm Transco, claims the cost of fitting out a room is in the region of \u00a3250,000. Alternatively, BT is proposing to charge \u00a3900 every time a rival company wants access to its own equipment in an exchange. \"We are going forward but are effectively operating on faith, hoping that Oftel will take action over this madness,\" says Greco. The first exchanges to be opened to competition have now been made available. But they have been released in small tranches, drawing complaints that those offered so far are not in lucrative urban areas and are widely dispersed, making it virtually impossible to draw up business plans. The first 25 opened for competition received a derisory response. Orders for space were placed in only 14, with an average of one or two operators per site instead of the anticipated seven or eight. Several weeks ago, Oftel called an emergency meeting at which it pressed BT to bring forward the timetable for offering exchanges and launched an inquiry into the costs for companies wanting space. It didn't stop the likes of Kingston dropping out. The company said the timetable was still too piecemeal to allow development of a viable national network. But perhaps the most significant stumbling block is out of either BT's or Oftel's hands. For Redstone, the decision to retrench and focus on a few towns instead of large parts of the country was due to investors' loss of confidence in the sector. Capital markets have virtually closed to telecoms companies which have borrowed to the hilt over the past two years. Business development director Bob Cushing said Redstone had originally hoped to raise up to \u00a3150m to finance its plans for a national DSL service. As conditions worsened, however, Redstone's advisers warned against taking the debt on. \"The terms aren't attractive, and as we don't urgently need the cash it didn't make sense,\" he says. Ironically, the number of companies pulling out of the process has actually made local loop unbundling more attractive for the remaining few. Less competition for space means it will be easier to build a regional or national network of DSL lines. For many of the media companies developing broadband services there is a need for pragmatism. \"We've always had a strong belief that the timetable would be 18 months or so behind what BT was telling us so we have built that into our business models,\" says John Varney, director of technology at Granada Media. Next month, Granada launches a joint venture with Boots the chemists, which is billed as a broadband business but will operate in effect as a TV channel and sister website until the infrastructure catches up. The future is still coming, but it is further away than many had hoped.",

Unfortunately, though, the problem still remains of trying to find a flat that you like. After that, I go to Small Luxury Hotels of the World to see where I can run away to. Last online purchase? CDs from HMV and food from Sainsbury's. I do all my food shopping online. Anyone who would rather stand in a queue at a supermarket instead of sitting in front of a computer for five minutes must be crazy. Most recent technological faux pas? When I haven't understood a technological term that someone has used in a meeting and everyone looks at me like it's the most obvious thing in the entire world. That's OK because I don't have a problem asking: \"What's an SSL line?\" Main news source on the web? FT.com, CNN and BBC Online. Most persistent spam emailer? Lastminute.com but maybe it's my fault and I should just take myself off. Time spent on the web? I'm on and off all day long, and probably spend an hour and half a day at the weekend. Next boo.com? I thought it was going to be Letsbuyit, but they've had a bit of a rescue bid. I think they all suffer from the same problems of overstaffing and overspending on the marketing budget. Least useful site on the web? lastminute.com - it drives me mad. It's like going into a sweet shop and having a million different choices. It's overwhelming and I can't find anything. Which screensaver do you use? None. They've never appealed to me. Most irritating thing about the web? When you've had your fantastic fast internet connection at work, and you go home and it's so much slower. This isn't the web's fault - it's the lack of technology being introduced by BT and NTL to provide the same service at home as you get at work. Do you still bother with old media? Absolutely. You can't replace a good magazine in the bath or a Sunday newspaper. \u0095 Shaa Wasmund is the CEO of Mykindaplace.com.",

It was a political correspondent asking for a comment on a new almighty row over Europe. This had everything: the single currency, tax, integration - and Germans. The story was that Tony Blair had agreed with Chancellor Schr\u00f6der that the Euro would eventually lead to fiscal harmonisation. It had to be true, the Germans had briefed on it. </p> <p>There were only a few minutes before the 4pm afternoon lobby, which Smith was due to take in the now-familiar absence of Alastair Campbell. After the most traumatic week in the spin-life of this government, this was the last thing any of them needed. </p> <p>The latest fracas stemmed from a dinner between Blair and Schr\u00f6der in Berlin on Monday night, one of those lightning bilateral visits that often go unnoticed by the papers. The event passed off smoothly, or so they thought. Both sides put out what is known as a \"dry line\", in other words as little information as possible, noting they had discussed Anglo-German ties, relations with the US as the new administration settles in, Russia, and - obliquely - future European cooperation. They also produced a joint statement on football transfer fees. The political spin was that the Prime Minister was getting back to real business after the Mandelson saga. </p> <p>The following lunchtime, German and foreign correspondents in Berlin were invited to a briefing by Michael Steiner, Schr\u00f6der's chief foreign policy adviser. Steiner's account of the previous evening's meeting, which was relayed by the press corps back to London, was somewhat different. </p> <p>Blair, he suggested, had agreed with the German Chancellor's view that, once part of the euro, the UK would accept the need for common tax rates. This was the exact reverse of Blair's oft-stated public line, and red rag to a bull. Several lobby members were in high excitement when Smith met them in the usual turret meeting room. They hadn't had a good euro bust-up since Nice, more than a month ago - and on that occasion, Britain wasn't even at the centre of it. </p> <p>Before leaving for the Commons, Smith spoke to Patrick Sawer, Blair's foreign policy man in his private office, the other member of the foursome at the Berlin dinner. He told him Schr\u00f6der had referred to tax in passing, but Blair had said nothing in reply. Therefore, the conclusion was, no discussion on tax had taken place. That was enough for a holding position for the lobby. </p> <p>Shortly after, Steiner was contacted and an explanation was sought. The Germans asserted that lines must have got crossed. A clarification was issued. Steiner, it was said, had also been briefing on the Franco-German summit that was to take place in Alsace on Wednesday evening with President Chirac, and his mentions of tax referred to that meeting. The soft-spoken Smith hoped this provided enough ammunition to kill the story. </p> <p>It largely worked. The broadcast media by and large ignored it. Only some papers carried the story. The Telegraph had the most - a page lead on its foreign pages, stating that Blair was \"embroiled in an embarrassing row\"; the Times ran a single column at the bottom of page 16, headlined \"German gaffe on the Euro\"; the Independent had a small piece on page 2, and even the Daily Mail put it on page 4. Had it not been for the Alder Hey controversy, and more fallout from the Mandelson affair, things could have been a lot worse. </p> <p>So anxious is the government about Europe that it works from the assumption that any story on the subject is bound to be negative. As for Steiner, I have met him several times. He is extremely smart and well aware of the internal British debate. But he has more than once expressed the view to me that, as long as Britain remains outside the euro, its influence will diminish. </p> <p>German officials are also convinced that the British will accept this in the long run. For once, I suspect, Steiner's candid and perceptive view of British policy got the better of diplomatic niceties, spin and double spin. And for once, the Westminster lobby was prepared to give all involved the benefit of the doubt.</p>",

      "byline": "Roy Greenslade",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Just in case you haven't noticed, the Press Complaints Commission will celebrate its 10th anniversary on Wednesday at what the Sun calls \"the star-studded party of the year\". Prince Charles, Prince William and Camilla Parker Bowles are expected to rub shoulders with George Michael, former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and supermodel Claudia Schiffer, a sprinkling of soap stars, senior politicians and most of the national newspaper editors. </p> <p>What the wildly exaggerated Sun story didn't say is that the stars who will attend have one thing in common: they have all complained to the PCC. It also overlooked the fact that the guests will include a selection of complainants who are not famous. </p> <p>One of them is Christopher Livesey, an Accrington lad who suffered from press harassment at a time when the PCC was drawing up guidelines to protect Prince William. Lord Wakeham, PCC chairman, famously remarked that both boys deserved exactly the same right to privacy. </p> <p>It is ironic that press coverage of the party should encourage the perception that the PCC pays attention only to complaints from the famous and near-famous. It does not, but it has to be remembered that, as far as national papers are concerned, the majority of complainants tend to be high profile because, of course, they are the subjects of most stories. </p> <p>Indeed, the PCC came into existence because of pressure from politicians and other members of the establishment upset by the particularly bad behaviour of papers in the 1980s. </p> <p>Several MPs were pressing for laws to protect privacy and to provide a statutory right of reply. The government responded in 1989 by appointing a committee, chaired by David Calcutt QC, to consider whether the MPs might be right. While it was hearing evidence, the then home office minister, David Mellor, showed his feelings by warning that \"the press - the popular press - is drinking in the Last Chance Saloon\". Calcutt's report echoed that sentiment. </p> <p>Self-regulation should have one more chance. The Press Council should be replaced by the PCC which would have 18 months to prove that it could work effectively. If not, Calcutt warned that he would push for legislation. </p> <p>This threat alarmed newspaper owners enough for them to hold a historic meeting at which they put aside their enmities to agree a united response. Sent to represent my then boss, Robert Maxwell, I witnessed the industry's most powerful figures wrestling with the problem. I detected a difference in emphasis between those who controlled broadsheets - especially Conrad Black (director and chairman of the Daily Telegraph) and Andreas Whittam Smith (editor and chief executive of the Independent), who made the best contributions - and those responsible for tabloids. Neither side wanted legislation; they feared that serious investigative journalism was at risk if a law was enacted. </p> <p>It was decided that if editors were to respect the PCC, they needed a proper set of guidelines, a code, so that everyone - journalists and public - knew where they stood. </p> <p>Editors then met to agree on a code. In what turned out to be a shrewd move, though I was motivated by mischief, I nominated the then editor of the News of the World, Patsy Chapman, to take the chair. Her paper was widely considered as second only to the Sun as the greatest sinner, and it was obvious that if she approved some kind of ethical code it would stand a good chance of being accepted by everyone. </p> <p>That is just how it turned out. With great tact, Chapman chaired a series of editors' meetings, drawn from a variety of national and regional papers. What emerged was the editors' code of practice, which has been the most effective brake on press misdeeds since newspapers were first forced to set up a self-regulatory regime in 1953. </p> <p>The PCC's job therefore was to ensure that editors obeyed their own code, an apparently straightforward task which was to prove a great deal more complex and, eventually, beyond the skills of its first chairman, Lord McGregor. He got a taste of what to expect on his first day when Buckingham Palace asked him to go to Sandringham immediately to see how Prince Charles and Princess Diana were being hounded by the press. He refused, but it was a significant pointer to problems ahead. </p> <p>The PCC had a far from promising start, almost collapsing in 1993 when Calcutt made another powerful plea for a statutory body and Mirror group's chief executive, David Montgomery, briefly withdrew his papers from membership because McGregor not only criticised the Daily Mirror for using pictures of Princess Diana exercising in a gym, but called for an advertising boycott. Behind-the-scenes diplomacy by the Daily Mail's editor-in-chief, David English, saved the day: a wiser, veteran press chief prevented a rogue publisher from destroying the PCC. Has self-regulation ever worked so well? </p> <p>That episode certainly indicated that McGregor might not be up to the job. His rush to judgment when the Sunday Times serialised the Andrew Morton book on Diana, lambasting it for \"dabbling their fingers in the stuff of other people's souls\", proved the point. </p> <p>McGregor might well have got into more trouble, and jeopardised the PCC's future, had he not had an able director in Mark Bolland. Gradually, in spite of the hiccups, the PCC gained respect and adjudications were taken seriously by editors. They fought hard to ensure complaints were not upheld, but complied with the rule that they must publish them in full when they were. </p> <p>When McGregor retired in 1995, I was downcast when Lord Wakeham got the chairmanship. Surely this former Tory party minister was the wrong man for the job? He would be compromised by his party allegiance, not to mention his string of directorships. He would find editors altogether less amenable to his behind-the-Speaker's-chair brand of fixing. </p> <p>In fact, Wakeham turned out to be an inspired choice. His first major test came in his first year when the News of the World published a picture of Countess Spencer in a clinic, a clear breach of the editors' code. </p> <p>Wakeham spoke to Rupert Murdoch, convinced him of the gravity of the offence and Murdoch then repudiated editor Piers Morgan in public. The PCC's authority was established, and it's fair to say that no editor has violated the code so flagrantly since. </p> <p>Bolland went off to work for Prince Charles, and his successor, Guy Black, quickly formed a good working relationship with Wakeham. They also built a dependable team at their office just off Fleet Street, the last link between national papers and their former home. </p> <p>Diana's death in 1997, with its reminder of the activities of photographic stalkers, was a turning point for the PCC. The code on the use of pictures was tightened along with extra measures to protect children. </p> <p>There have been other landmarks, too, among the 23,000 cases dealt with in the decade: an adjudication against the Mail on Sunday for intruding into the privacy of the prime minister's daughter; a complaint upheld against the News of the World for publishing a kiss-and-tell story about Coronation Street actress Jacqueline Pirie; the humbling criticism of Morgan, this time as Mirror editor, after the share-tipping fiasco. </p> <p>Perhaps the most useful development in trying to decide whether intrusion is justified has been the PCC's concept of \"proportionality\". Just because a person is famous, and has previously appeared in papers or magazines, they cannot be said to sacrifice all rights to privacy. </p> <p>But Wakeham and Black would be the first to admit that the code is not perfect. In a sense, it never will be, and perhaps it never should be. It has to be elastic enough to take account of unpredictable events, and it still has to allow for editors to have the freedom to be wrong. The public interest test is often a matter of fierce debate. </p> <p>Similarly, self-regulation itself remains suspect for many people. The PCC is funded by the newspapers it polices. Its only sanction is censure. Most lawyers think it flawed in concept and in practice, but they would, wouldn't they? </p> <p>Two of the PCC's long-running leading critics, Labour MP Clive Soley and Mike Jempson, director of the media ethics body Presswise, readily concede that press behaviour has improved over the past 10 years. \"It would be churlish not to say so,\" says Soley. But he points to PCC failings that many other people often mention to me, especially those who have complained unsuccessfully. First, the PCC prefers to act as a conciliator rather than a judge. It seeks to find a compromise in which the paper often comes out best, publishing a small correction or a letter, which people find unsatisfying. The punishment has not met the crime. </p> <p>Second, Soley believes it is too rarely proactive, a charge backed by Jempson, who thinks it unfair that neither third parties nor groups of people are able to complain.

      "bodyText": "Just in case you haven't noticed, the Press Complaints Commission will celebrate its 10th anniversary on Wednesday at what the Sun calls \"the star-studded party of the year\". Prince Charles, Prince William and Camilla Parker Bowles are expected to rub shoulders with George Michael, former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and supermodel Claudia Schiffer, a sprinkling of soap stars, senior politicians and most of the national newspaper editors. What the wildly exaggerated Sun story didn't say is that the stars who will attend have one thing in common: they have all complained to the PCC. It also overlooked the fact that the guests will include a selection of complainants who are not famous. One of them is Christopher Livesey, an Accrington lad who suffered from press harassment at a time when the PCC was drawing up guidelines to protect Prince William. Lord Wakeham, PCC chairman, famously remarked that both boys deserved exactly the same right to privacy. It is ironic that press coverage of the party should encourage the perception that the PCC pays attention only to complaints from the famous and near-famous. It does not, but it has to be remembered that, as far as national papers are concerned, the majority of complainants tend to be high profile because, of course, they are the subjects of most stories. Indeed, the PCC came into existence because of pressure from politicians and other members of the establishment upset by the particularly bad behaviour of papers in the 1980s. Several MPs were pressing for laws to protect privacy and to provide a statutory right of reply. The government responded in 1989 by appointing a committee, chaired by David Calcutt QC, to consider whether the MPs might be right. While it was hearing evidence, the then home office minister, David Mellor, showed his feelings by warning that \"the press - the popular press - is drinking in the Last Chance Saloon\". Calcutt's report echoed that sentiment. Self-regulation should have one more chance. The Press Council should be replaced by the PCC which would have 18 months to prove that it could work effectively. If not, Calcutt warned that he would push for legislation. This threat alarmed newspaper owners enough for them to hold a historic meeting at which they put aside their enmities to agree a united response. Sent to represent my then boss, Robert Maxwell, I witnessed the industry's most powerful figures wrestling with the problem. I detected a difference in emphasis between those who controlled broadsheets - especially Conrad Black (director and chairman of the Daily Telegraph) and Andreas Whittam Smith (editor and chief executive of the Independent), who made the best contributions - and those responsible for tabloids. Neither side wanted legislation; they feared that serious investigative journalism was at risk if a law was enacted. It was decided that if editors were to respect the PCC, they needed a proper set of guidelines, a code, so that everyone - journalists and public - knew where they stood. Editors then met to agree on a code. In what turned out to be a shrewd move, though I was motivated by mischief, I nominated the then editor of the News of the World, Patsy Chapman, to take the chair. Her paper was widely considered as second only to the Sun as the greatest sinner, and it was obvious that if she approved some kind of ethical code it would stand a good chance of being accepted by everyone. That is just how it turned out. With great tact, Chapman chaired a series of editors' meetings, drawn from a variety of national and regional papers. What emerged was the editors' code of practice, which has been the most effective brake on press misdeeds since newspapers were first forced to set up a self-regulatory regime in 1953. The PCC's job therefore was to ensure that editors obeyed their own code, an apparently straightforward task which was to prove a great deal more complex and, eventually, beyond the skills of its first chairman, Lord McGregor. He got a taste of what to expect on his first day when Buckingham Palace asked him to go to Sandringham immediately to see how Prince Charles and Princess Diana were being hounded by the press. He refused, but it was a significant pointer to problems ahead. The PCC had a far from promising start, almost collapsing in 1993 when Calcutt made another powerful plea for a statutory body and Mirror group's chief executive, David Montgomery, briefly withdrew his papers from membership because McGregor not only criticised the Daily Mirror for using pictures of Princess Diana exercising in a gym, but called for an advertising boycott. Behind-the-scenes diplomacy by the Daily Mail's editor-in-chief, David English, saved the day: a wiser, veteran press chief prevented a rogue publisher from destroying the PCC. Has self-regulation ever worked so well? That episode certainly indicated that McGregor might not be up to the job. His rush to judgment when the Sunday Times serialised the Andrew Morton book on Diana, lambasting it for \"dabbling their fingers in the stuff of other people's souls\", proved the point. McGregor might well have got into more trouble, and jeopardised the PCC's future, had he not had an able director in Mark Bolland. Gradually, in spite of the hiccups, the PCC gained respect and adjudications were taken seriously by editors. They fought hard to ensure complaints were not upheld, but complied with the rule that they must publish them in full when they were. When McGregor retired in 1995, I was downcast when Lord Wakeham got the chairmanship. Surely this former Tory party minister was the wrong man for the job? He would be compromised by his party allegiance, not to mention his string of directorships. He would find editors altogether less amenable to his behind-the-Speaker's-chair brand of fixing. In fact, Wakeham turned out to be an inspired choice. His first major test came in his first year when the News of the World published a picture of Countess Spencer in a clinic, a clear breach of the editors' code. Wakeham spoke to Rupert Murdoch, convinced him of the gravity of the offence and Murdoch then repudiated editor Piers Morgan in public. The PCC's authority was established, and it's fair to say that no editor has violated the code so flagrantly since. Bolland went off to work for Prince Charles, and his successor, Guy Black, quickly formed a good working relationship with Wakeham. They also built a dependable team at their office just off Fleet Street, the last link between national papers and their former home. Diana's death in 1997, with its reminder of the activities of photographic stalkers, was a turning point for the PCC. The code on the use of pictures was tightened along with extra measures to protect children. There have been other landmarks, too, among the 23,000 cases dealt with in the decade: an adjudication against the Mail on Sunday for intruding into the privacy of the prime minister's daughter; a complaint upheld against the News of the World for publishing a kiss-and-tell story about Coronation Street actress Jacqueline Pirie; the humbling criticism of Morgan, this time as Mirror editor, after the share-tipping fiasco. Perhaps the most useful development in trying to decide whether intrusion is justified has been the PCC's concept of \"proportionality\". Just because a person is famous, and has previously appeared in papers or magazines, they cannot be said to sacrifice all rights to privacy. But Wakeham and Black would be the first to admit that the code is not perfect. In a sense, it never will be, and perhaps it never should be. It has to be elastic enough to take account of unpredictable events, and it still has to allow for editors to have the freedom to be wrong. The public interest test is often a matter of fierce debate. Similarly, self-regulation itself remains suspect for many people. The PCC is funded by the newspapers it polices. Its only sanction is censure. Most lawyers think it flawed in concept and in practice, but they would, wouldn't they? Two of the PCC's long-running leading critics, Labour MP Clive Soley and Mike Jempson, director of the media ethics body Presswise, readily concede that press behaviour has improved over the past 10 years. \"It would be churlish not to say so,\" says Soley. But he points to PCC failings that many other people often mention to me, especially those who have complained unsuccessfully. First, the PCC prefers to act as a conciliator rather than a judge. It seeks to find a compromise in which the paper often comes out best, publishing a small correction or a letter, which people find unsatisfying. The punishment has not met the crime. Second, Soley believes it is too rarely proactive, a charge backed by Jempson, who thinks it unfair that neither third parties nor groups of people are able to complain. He is particularly exercised by the unfair press treatment of asylum seekers who have no way of answering through the PCC the distortions about them. Jempson is also right when he says that people find it difficult to mount their evidence against papers. In many cases, it is their word against the journalist's, \"yet there is no mechanism for the commission to get at the truth\". Therefore papers too often tend to be given the benefit of the doubt. These are genuine grievances that demand attention. But looking at last year's PCC statistics I noted that most complaints, as usual, were about accuracy in reporting. Then again, the percentage relating to accuracy (58%) was the lowest in 10 years - a better birthday tribute the PCC than this week's party.",

The Independent Television Commission banned the campaign in response to complaints. Eighteen customers complained that, when the ads were on air last summer, branch closures were still going ahead and the bank had not yet abolished its overdraft fees. The ITC also banned an ad for the alcoholic drink Reef. The commercial showed a group of young women confronting a bunch of men in a bar and performing a tribal dance. More than 100 viewers complained the dance shown in the ad appeared to be the haka, the ceremonial dance performed by Maori men, which is a sacred part of Maori culture. The ITC ruled the ad crossed the boundary between poor taste and serious offence. A campaign for Brandt Appliances, in which adults were shown smashing up cookers and fridges so they could treat themselves to new Brandt Appliances, was banned from being shown during children's programming. 126 viewers complained it was too violent and could promote domestic violence.

Now he's writing the ITC's response to the BBC's digital channels, which he helped her devise originally while at the BBC. </p> <p>\u0095 On rising early last week Monkey happened to see old friend Peter Salmon appearing on Breakfast News to praise the BBC's latest boxing triumphs: signing Audley Harrison and winning Lennox Lewis's next heavyweight contest. What a shame that the new head of sport got a bit confused and found himself talking about soccer instead of sparring. The BBC's new-found enthusiasm for boxing has raised some wry smiles among the old stagers. They remember only too well that John Birt explicitly decreed, circa 1993, that boxing was no longer a suitable sport for Auntie's airwaves ... just as Prince Naseem began his rise. </p> <p>\u0095 Battle of the wits in adland. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi is currently having its reception renovated, with large workman's boards obscuring the entrance. Its oh-so-clever sign \"Bill posters will not be prosecuted\" was unfortunately taken at face value by rival agency TBWA up the road. At 7am on Thursday, Trevor Beattie's mob pasted up a huge poster covering the boards. Inside a large arrow pointing left, it read \"You'll get a better reception at TBWA\". </p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Neil is a man who takes great pride in his appearance - even if others are not quite so appreciative of his efforts. At a bash held in the swanky surroundings of the Dorchester Hotel in London to celebrate rising Scotsman sales, he sported a pair of yellow-rimmed spectacles that would have seemed slightly unusual even on the sportiest of street kids. Monkey applauds such fashion smarts, but has yet to be updated by the style desk about the addition of an orange tie. It must be what the young people are wearing in Scotland this month. </p> <p>\u0095 After their recent row over the ITV news contract, Sky and ITN have temporarily buried the hatchet in the name of charity. The pair have supplied film for the Community Channel, which is promoting the aid appeal for the India earthquake. It's nice to see we can all be friends sometimes. </p> <p>\u0095 While the Popstars starlets are poised to take over the celebrity world, the world of celebrities has been waiting with bated breath for the revelation of their new rivals. Away from home for last week's hastily scheduled midweek edition, singer Liam Gallagher and his girlfriend Nicole Appleton suddenly realised they had forgotten to set the video. If you're desperate, Liam, Monkey has a copy you can borrow.</p>",

Now he's writing the ITC's response to the BBC's digital channels, which he helped her devise originally while at the BBC. \u0095 On rising early last week Monkey happened to see old friend Peter Salmon appearing on Breakfast News to praise the BBC's latest boxing triumphs: signing Audley Harrison and winning Lennox Lewis's next heavyweight contest. What a shame that the new head of sport got a bit confused and found himself talking about soccer instead of sparring. The BBC's new-found enthusiasm for boxing has raised some wry smiles among the old stagers. They remember only too well that John Birt explicitly decreed, circa 1993, that boxing was no longer a suitable sport for Auntie's airwaves ... just as Prince Naseem began his rise. \u0095 Battle of the wits in adland. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi is currently having its reception renovated, with large workman's boards obscuring the entrance. Its oh-so-clever sign \"Bill posters will not be prosecuted\" was unfortunately taken at face value by rival agency TBWA up the road. At 7am on Thursday, Trevor Beattie's mob pasted up a huge poster covering the boards. Inside a large arrow pointing left, it read \"You'll get a better reception at TBWA\". \u0095 Andrew Neil is a man who takes great pride in his appearance - even if others are not quite so appreciative of his efforts. At a bash held in the swanky surroundings of the Dorchester Hotel in London to celebrate rising Scotsman sales, he sported a pair of yellow-rimmed spectacles that would have seemed slightly unusual even on the sportiest of street kids. Monkey applauds such fashion smarts, but has yet to be updated by the style desk about the addition of an orange tie. It must be what the young people are wearing in Scotland this month. \u0095 After their recent row over the ITV news contract, Sky and ITN have temporarily buried the hatchet in the name of charity. The pair have supplied film for the Community Channel, which is promoting the aid appeal for the India earthquake. It's nice to see we can all be friends sometimes. \u0095 While the Popstars starlets are poised to take over the celebrity world, the world of celebrities has been waiting with bated breath for the revelation of their new rivals. Away from home for last week's hastily scheduled midweek edition, singer Liam Gallagher and his girlfriend Nicole Appleton suddenly realised they had forgotten to set the video. If you're desperate, Liam, Monkey has a copy you can borrow.",

The deal could offer hope to the 450,000 with-profits policyholders at Equitable, who have been wondering what to do with their money after the company ran into trouble over its handling of guaranteed annuity policies. The Halifax offer - which beat off a last-minute challenge from US financial services group GE Capital - will create a banking and life insurance giant called Halifax Equitable. Equitable was forced to seek a buyer last July after judges ruled that it had acted unlawfully in cutting bonuses to holders of guaranteed annuity rate (Gar) policies. The ruling left the mutual with a big hole in its capital, estimated at upwards of \u00a31.5bn. The Equitable's chief executive, Chris Headdon, said that the transaction is good for Equitable's policyholders, bringing \u00a31bn into its life fund. \"That's real money that's coming into the fund for the benefit of policyholders,\" he said. \"It gives us a real incentive for us to resolve this guaranteed annuity issue.\" Mr Headdon said that the Halifax offer has been accepted by the board. \"This is a good result for policyholders after a long period of uncertainty,\" he added. The transaction will accelerate Halifax's diversification away from low-margin mortgages towards higher-growth long-term savings, effectively doubling Halifax's funds under management. The Equitable, the world's oldest mutual insurance company, was forced to close to new business in December when UK insurer Prudential pulled out of talks to rescue the group, causing outrage among Equitable's 90,000 holders of Gar policies. Halifax, which already owns life insurer Clerical Medical, will initially pay \u00a3500m for Equitable's operating business, including its fund-management operation, administration systems and 400-strong sales force.

The financial services authority, which oversees all UK financial services, welcomed the announcement. But shadow paymaster general Richard Ottaway said that the deal should not spell the end of an inquiry into the problem faced by policyholders. He said: \"The Halifax offer is good news for Equitable Life policyholders and we welcome this move, which should ease the concerns of millions of people affected by the company's recent difficulties. \"However, despite today's announcement, serious questions still remain over the Treasury's conduct and supervision of the life assurance sector in 1998. \"It is still essential that the financial services authority continue their investigation into their handling of the matter,\" Mr Ottaway added.

Friends of the girl claim that she communicated with them towards the end of last year, saying that she was living in Greece and that she was fine. \"Any parent who has a child using the internet, whether monitored or not, needs to know this can happen,\" the girl's mother, Stephanie Lavoie, told a news conference in Salonika. \"The internet can be evil.\" Mr B\u00e4hring denies doing anything wrong, and says he hoped to marry the girl.",

The cow shed in question was built by Hugo H\u00e4ring (1882-1958), the subject of a small yet fascinating exhibition at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London. In the design of this remarkable structure it is possible to see the genesis of the humane Modern Movement housing, particularly of the 1970s, and the work of, say, Ralph Erskine at Byker in Newcastle and Edward Cullinan in suburban London. The reaction against prefab concrete, orthogonal geometry (architect-speak for straight lines) and the barrack-like architecture prescribed by architects over-influenced by the machine aesthetic of the Bauhaus led to a more relaxed, bricky, even tweedy social housing in the 1970s. </p> <p>H\u00e4ring was a rarity at the time: in his 40s when he designed the cow shed, he was an architect who thought that the new machine aesthetic should be flexible enough to be shaped by circumstances. \"There was naturally no room for influences of another kind,for folk-art, earthy traditions, Saxon gables surmounted with horses' heads,\" he wrote in an article about the cow shed published in 1925. \"But, even so, the building seems to belong more essentially to its site and landscape than older structures.\" </p> <p>H\u00e4ring may well have been the inspiration - one of them, at least - for the character of Professor Otto Silenus in Evelyn Waugh's Decline and Fall. Silenus is the humourless young architect commissioned by the interminably fashionable Margot Beste-Chetwynde to demolish her stately pile and replace it with a machine for living. His mission, he says, is to eradicate the human element from architecture; he proposes a house without a staircase, which would spoil the purity of his white, geometric design. His only claim to fame prior to the Beste-Chetwynde commission, we learn, is a design for an unbuilt bubble-gum factory published in an obscure European journal. At the time of the novel H\u00e4ring would have only been known by a very few avant-garde British architects for his cow shed and his sausage factory (1925-6) at Neustadt, Holstein. John Betjeman was assistant editor of the Architectural Review when Waugh, his friend, was writing Decline and Fall. It is only too easy to imagine them sniggering at the latest funny designs for cow sheds and sausage factories. </p> <p>The L\u00fcbeck cow shed is a fine building, at once modern and related to its surroundings. You expect it to have been turned into a museum or gallery. But no: today it is a handsome home to a colony of pigs. The cows gave way to pigs in the 1970s, when architects in Britain were finally learning to design housing estates fit for humans. H\u00e4ring's next best work was for adairy farm, designed in 1943 for friends in his native Biberach. </p> <p>But he also turned his attention to housing for humans, and it's a great shame that he never realised his postwar designs for low-cost courtyard estates. These would have been so much more humane than most of the mass-housing that was built across Europe after 1945. Writing of H\u00e4ring's courtyards, Peter Blundell Jones and Nasser Golzari, curators of the RIBA show, highlight their qualities: \"Often he managed to give the inhabitants of tiny houses a range of differently orientated views into contrasting room-sized courts. It was a world of pedestrians and bicycles with small alleys between rows and occasional larger avenues for motor vehicles.\" </p> <p>We didn't get H\u00e4ring homes; instead we got huge estates and tower blocks that made no one happy, except their bow-tied designers, town councillors in search of CBEs and photographers specialising in Sunday supplement images of urban grit. It does seem strange that an architect who made his name through farm buildings might also have made one of the greatest housing designers of the second half of the 20th century. Although a believer in order and geometry, he sought his angles in what he saw as the ever unfolding laws of Nature. Criticising Bauhaus designers, and the early precise white designs of Le Corbusier, he wrote: \"The unity we achieve in many things on the grounds of geometric figures is only a unity of form, not a unity in terms of life. A polished metal sphere is certainly a fantastic [sensation] for our spirit, but a flower is a life-experience.\" </p> <p>In the quiet and largely unsung work of Hugo H\u00e4ring can be experienced the possibilities of a humane modern architecture to be shared by all - cows, pigs, and sausage-eating people. His contribution remains relevant. Where there's muck there's brass, and maybe even gold, waiting to be uncovered by future British architects, who may yet get the chance to build a new generation of social housing.</p>",

The government's industrial strategy is based on the notion that the traditional industries of Britain - steel, cars, textiles, metal-bashing in all its forms - are on their way out. It believes that the future lies at the hi-tech end of the spectrum, where firms are competing on quality, not price. </p> <p>Official figures for manufacturing show this is the direction in which industry has been moving. Production of hi-tech goods such as mobile phones has been growing strongly while the weakest-performing sector has been textiles, which is being wiped out by lower-cost goods from developing countries. The strength of the pound has merely accelerated this process but, far from regretting this trend, the government sees it as inevitable. </p> <p>At present, however, it is not expedient to say this, so with breath-taking hypocrisy the government is attacking Corus for doing precisely what it has said modern, dynamic companies should be doing. </p> <p>None of the measures that might save jobs at Corus - at a price - appeals to ministers. One option would be to throw up a protective wall around Britain, using high tariffs to prevent foreign steel entering the country and thereby ensuring a buy-British policy, even if localisation meant accepting economic inefficiency. Yet the government believes in free trade and is bound by the rules of the World Trade Organisation. </p> <p>In the the days of beer and sandwiches, direct government intervention, through public ownership or subsidies, would have had support around the cabinet table. But no longer, not least because every billion pounds spent saving jobs in steel is a billion that cannot be spent investing in health or education. The state-subsidy route would also be outlawed by EU law. </p> <p>Below, Ed Balls and John Healey describe what the government is doing to beef up regional policy, which is an important weapon in coping with shocks to local economies. But those at the sharp end argue that regional policy cannot compensate if macro-economic policies are out of kilter. Yet there is not the slightest evidence that the government is going to change its macro-economic framework or even chide the Bank of England for keeping inflation below its target for almost two years. </p> <p>There is one final option. As far as supporters of the single currency are concerned, Labour is paying the price for refusing to join monetary union and even more jobs will be lost unless it decides now to enter at a lower exchange rate. But, if the strength of sterling were the real reason for the loss of jobs in manufacturing, then presumably there should have been an expansion of jobs in industry during the almost uninterrupted decline in the pound's value since 1945. As the chart shows, this has not been the case. </p> <p>Also, under current arrangements for setting interest rates, a lower exchange rate is no free lunch. All the indications are that the Bank would respond to a big devaluation of sterling by pushing up interest rates as a hedge against imported inflation. Inside monetary union, Britain would be faced with the Irish problem - excess demand that would have to be mopped up using higher taxes or lower public spending. Exporters might gain at the expense of businesses with a purely domestic focus. </p> <p>Certainly, one problem for Corus is the structural decline in UK manufacturing, which has affected domestic demand for steel and forced the company to compete in tough overseas markets, where sterling's level has been a factor. </p> <p>However, the idea that joining monetary union will safeguard jobs in any threatened sector is a fallacy. In essence, Labour's industrial policy is no different from Mrs Thatcher's; the strong survive global competition, the weak go to the wall. The logic of the government's policy is that in 20 years' time there will not be a single steelworker in Britain but that it doesn't matter because we will be able to buy all the steel we want more cheaply from low-cost producers while increasing exports from sectors where we are strong. But don't expect logic - or much honesty - over the next few months when, metaphorically at least, Tony will be smearing HP sauce on his steak and chips, and taking his labrador for a walk. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a> </p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/story/0,3604,431802,00.html\">01.02.2001: 5,000 jobs go in steel closure plan</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,431290,00.html\"> 31.01.2001: Union will press on with Llanwern bid </a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,430948,00.html\"> 31.01.2001: Anger as Corus rejects takeover bid</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,430694,00.html\">30.01.2001, comment: Smeltdown</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.corusgroup.com/ \">Key player: Corus</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.istc-tu.org/\">Key player: ISTC (Iron and Steel Trades Confederation) trade union</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.dti.gov.uk/\">Key player: DTI</a></p>",

Yet there is not the slightest evidence that the government is going to change its macro-economic framework or even chide the Bank of England for keeping inflation below its target for almost two years. There is one final option. As far as supporters of the single currency are concerned, Labour is paying the price for refusing to join monetary union and even more jobs will be lost unless it decides now to enter at a lower exchange rate. But, if the strength of sterling were the real reason for the loss of jobs in manufacturing, then presumably there should have been an expansion of jobs in industry during the almost uninterrupted decline in the pound's value since 1945. As the chart shows, this has not been the case. Also, under current arrangements for setting interest rates, a lower exchange rate is no free lunch. All the indications are that the Bank would respond to a big devaluation of sterling by pushing up interest rates as a hedge against imported inflation. Inside monetary union, Britain would be faced with the Irish problem - excess demand that would have to be mopped up using higher taxes or lower public spending. Exporters might gain at the expense of businesses with a purely domestic focus. Certainly, one problem for Corus is the structural decline in UK manufacturing, which has affected domestic demand for steel and forced the company to compete in tough overseas markets, where sterling's level has been a factor. However, the idea that joining monetary union will safeguard jobs in any threatened sector is a fallacy. In essence, Labour's industrial policy is no different from Mrs Thatcher's; the strong survive global competition, the weak go to the wall. The logic of the government's policy is that in 20 years' time there will not be a single steelworker in Britain but that it doesn't matter because we will be able to buy all the steel we want more cheaply from low-cost producers while increasing exports from sectors where we are strong. But don't expect logic - or much honesty - over the next few months when, metaphorically at least, Tony will be smearing HP sauce on his steak and chips, and taking his labrador for a walk. larry.elliott@theguardian.com Related stories 01.02.2001: 5,000 jobs go in steel closure plan 31.01.2001: Union will press on with Llanwern bid 31.01.2001: Anger as Corus rejects takeover bid 30.01.2001, comment: Smeltdown Useful links Key player: Corus Key player: ISTC (Iron and Steel Trades Confederation) trade union Key player: DTI",

The good news has come too late for the architect of the recovery, chief executive Bob Ayling, who was forced out after losing the board's confidence. His successor Rod Eddington stands to take credit for a heavy cost cutting programme instigated by Mr Ayling.

Launched in Nanjing, the scheme entitles those who give 800ml or more blood to an unlimited free transfusion in the event of medical need. Those giving less than 800ml earn up to three times the amount given. Relatives are entitled to a transfusion equal to the amount the donor has given. The regulations require anyone receiving a transfusion who has not given blood to pay for it, but a refund can be earned by giving blood within a year. The young and elderly are exempt from these requirements. Nanjing, capital of the rich Yangtze valley province of Jiangsu, hopes that the scheme will solve a shortfall of blood supplies made worse by efforts to crack down on the widespread practice of selling blood. A blood donation law which took effect in October 1998 was supposed to ban all blood donations for money.

The data included telephone numbers, email addresses, payment details, hotels, room numbers, and arrival and departure times. About 1,400 names had credit card details - even those of spouses. The paper ran some items past the stunned deputy head of a pharmaceutical multinational, who confirmed their accuracy. \"We are taking this incident very seriously and are bringing in outside experts to clear up what happened,\" Charles McClean, a forum spokesman in Geneva, was quoted as saying.",

      "bodyText": "The Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, will today produce the evidence he claims proves the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing is innocent. In a move which will heighten tensions between the African state and the west, Colonel Gadafy will use a speech to demonstrate Abdel Baset al-Megrahi was not involved in the destruction of the Pan Am jumbo jet. Col Gadafy has said the evidence is so explosive it will leave the judges in the Lockerbie trial with three options: to resign, apologise and free Megrahi, or kill themselves. The prime minister, Tony Blair, and the US president, George Bush, have called on Col Gadafy to accept the ruling of the court and admit Libya's part in the biggest act of mass murder in British history. It is widely believed the Libyan leader will produce a document saying the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), extremists based in the Syrian capital, Damascus, was responsible. During the trial, William Taylor QC, defence counsel for Megrahi, tried in vain to persuade Syria to release such a document. Syria and Iran were initially suspected of engaging the PFLP-GC to blow up the jumbo in retaliation for the shooting-down of an Iranian airbus in the Persian Gulf by a US warship, the Vincennes, in July 1988, killing all 290 on board. Lockerbie followed in December 1988. Yesterday the leader of the PFLP-GC, Ahmed Jibril, told a Saudi newspaper that his group was not involved in Lockerbie, and threatened to sue the US government for libel. The newspaper, al-Watan, said Jibril \"voiced his readiness and that of other PFLP-GC officials to counter the fabricated accusations in front of any neutral body and said they were now waiting for the [Megrahi] appeal to look into the possibility of filing a defamation and slander suit against the US\". At the weekend there were street protests in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, over last week's verdict at the Scottish court in the Netherlands, which saw Megrahi convicted of murder and sentenced to a minimum of 20 years, and the acquittal of his co-accused, Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah.

My Guardian reports on these developments in the past eight months - and several interviews I did with prominent conservatives - set in motion a campaign against me by the reformers, unhappy at critical western press portrayals of their movement.

      "body": "<p>Hands cupped over headsets, the eavesdroppers squinted in concentration, awaiting another elliptical conversation in a foreign tongue. Even when translated the transcripts would yield little, for when using mobile phones the human traffickers always spoke in code.</p> <p>Not this time. A Slavic accent came on the line. \"Pronto?\" A pause, then an oriental accent replied: \"Si, pronto.\" They were speaking Italian.</p> <p>The Croat had excellent Italian but not his Chinese colleague. Using dialect or allusions - the traditional techniques to baffle eavesdroppers - were not options. Words had to be enunciated slowly and clearly. A van would take the group from Ljubljana in the morning and drop them at the motorway service station outside Trieste by 3pm. \"D'accordo, ciao,\" signed off the snakehead.</p> <p>It is not difficult to imagine the grins in Trieste's police headquarters. A few months later the gang, led by Josip Loncaric, was broken up by Slovenian and Italian police. They had discovered an achilles heel of transnational trafficking.</p> <p>That is one of the few bright spots in a grim outlook for Britain's efforts to spearhead a European Union war against illegal immigration. The government hopes that coordinated assaults can cut the influx and allay voter concern that illegal immigration is out of control.</p> <p>However interviews with traffickers, migrants, investigators, analysts and magistrates in five countries reveal an adaptable foe positioned to resist the challenge. Europe is facing a long war of attrition.</p> <p>When British immigration liaison officers take up their posts in Vienna, Rome, Budapest and Zagreb in the spring they will find networks capable of shooting or bribing their way out of most difficulties.</p> <p>Last November Hungarian police at the Ukrainian border uncovered a cache of guns with silencers, radio equipment tuned to police frequencies, night-vision glasses, binoculars, hand grenades and motorised rubber dinghies.</p> <p>Last summer French police broke up a Chinese smuggling ring which laundered \u00a3170m through two bureaux de change - enough to corrupt officials for decades.</p> <p>\"Profits are recycled into bribes. You get a lot of guards on tiny salaries getting rich and driving fancy cars,\" said Duc Tran of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), in Zagreb.</p> <p>More formidable still is a modus operandi which has evolved to make the bosses untouchable and their networks resilient. Rather than build the monolithic hierarchical cartels favoured by drug traffickers, they tend to sub-contract to freelancers in transit countries, like multinational companies.</p> <p>\"It is best to envisage smuggling groups as loosely structured organisations that consist of constantly shifting relationships,\" according to an IOM report written by Prof Ronald Skeldon, of the University of Sussex.</p> <p>An Italian parliamentary report identified three categories. At the top are regional bosses, especially in China, the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent. They find clients, forge alliances, set prices, stipulate conditions and authorise payments.</p> <p>At the middle level are bosses in transit countries, especially Turkey and the Balkans, who organise safe houses, commission false documents, choose routes, pay bribes and hire local criminals as drivers, guides, lookouts and guards. Drugs, tobacco and arms are included in some shipments, as favours to other gangs. Fugitive mobsters sometimes use the routes.</p> <p>At the the lowest level are minor smugglers in transit and destination countries valued for their local knowledge. Paid per job, they are expected to maintain equipment, establish rapport with corrupt officials, monitor beaches, train and bus stations, and choose points of handover.</p> <p>Few smugglers remain outside the system. \"The days when we cut our own deals with passengers is over. Now it's all middle men,\" lamented one veteran Albanian smuggler in the port of Vlore.</p> <p>Often waiting in the destination country are representatives of the origin country boss, who will detain the migrants until relatives pay the outstanding debt. Alternatively, the migrants might be put to work in sweatshops or as prostitutes. \"They operate like companies, except they use violence and torture as means of persuasion,\" said Tana De Zulueta, an Italian senator.</p> <p>By such segmentation, specialisation and flexibility has human trafficking become the world's fastest growing criminal business. Employees know little, if anything, about their ultimate bosses. Identifying them, gathering evidence and obtaining convictions is a herculean task.</p> <p>Routes are well established: Chinese via Belgrade, where former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic was happy to generate visa payments and annoy the west; migrants and asylum seekers from the Middle East, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka via Sarajevo, where Bosnian authorities obliged fellow Muslims. Last year more than 50,000 are estimated to have passed through on the way to western Europe.</p> <p>Three overland routes snake into Italy and Austria via Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary. Suffocations in trucks and drownings in the Sava river are common. Others board semi-inflatables for moonlit crossings of the Adriatic from Vlore or Split. More than 130 drowned last year.</p> <p>An Anglo-Italian initiative will intensify pressure on Yugoslavia and Bosnia to clamp down. Hopeful of western aid, they have already started. Croatia and Slovenia are praised by the Home Office for their efforts. The long-term goal is to make the Balkans stable enough for asylum seekers to stay there.</p> <p>In the meantime, the government wants joint police operations to hunt down the bosses in the transit countries, one by one.

      "bodyText": "Hands cupped over headsets, the eavesdroppers squinted in concentration, awaiting another elliptical conversation in a foreign tongue. Even when translated the transcripts would yield little, for when using mobile phones the human traffickers always spoke in code. Not this time. A Slavic accent came on the line. \"Pronto?\" A pause, then an oriental accent replied: \"Si, pronto.\" They were speaking Italian. The Croat had excellent Italian but not his Chinese colleague. Using dialect or allusions - the traditional techniques to baffle eavesdroppers - were not options. Words had to be enunciated slowly and clearly. A van would take the group from Ljubljana in the morning and drop them at the motorway service station outside Trieste by 3pm. \"D'accordo, ciao,\" signed off the snakehead. It is not difficult to imagine the grins in Trieste's police headquarters. A few months later the gang, led by Josip Loncaric, was broken up by Slovenian and Italian police. They had discovered an achilles heel of transnational trafficking. That is one of the few bright spots in a grim outlook for Britain's efforts to spearhead a European Union war against illegal immigration. The government hopes that coordinated assaults can cut the influx and allay voter concern that illegal immigration is out of control. However interviews with traffickers, migrants, investigators, analysts and magistrates in five countries reveal an adaptable foe positioned to resist the challenge. Europe is facing a long war of attrition. When British immigration liaison officers take up their posts in Vienna, Rome, Budapest and Zagreb in the spring they will find networks capable of shooting or bribing their way out of most difficulties. Last November Hungarian police at the Ukrainian border uncovered a cache of guns with silencers, radio equipment tuned to police frequencies, night-vision glasses, binoculars, hand grenades and motorised rubber dinghies. Last summer French police broke up a Chinese smuggling ring which laundered \u00a3170m through two bureaux de change - enough to corrupt officials for decades. \"Profits are recycled into bribes. You get a lot of guards on tiny salaries getting rich and driving fancy cars,\" said Duc Tran of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), in Zagreb. More formidable still is a modus operandi which has evolved to make the bosses untouchable and their networks resilient. Rather than build the monolithic hierarchical cartels favoured by drug traffickers, they tend to sub-contract to freelancers in transit countries, like multinational companies. \"It is best to envisage smuggling groups as loosely structured organisations that consist of constantly shifting relationships,\" according to an IOM report written by Prof Ronald Skeldon, of the University of Sussex. An Italian parliamentary report identified three categories. At the top are regional bosses, especially in China, the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent. They find clients, forge alliances, set prices, stipulate conditions and authorise payments. At the middle level are bosses in transit countries, especially Turkey and the Balkans, who organise safe houses, commission false documents, choose routes, pay bribes and hire local criminals as drivers, guides, lookouts and guards. Drugs, tobacco and arms are included in some shipments, as favours to other gangs. Fugitive mobsters sometimes use the routes. At the the lowest level are minor smugglers in transit and destination countries valued for their local knowledge. Paid per job, they are expected to maintain equipment, establish rapport with corrupt officials, monitor beaches, train and bus stations, and choose points of handover. Few smugglers remain outside the system. \"The days when we cut our own deals with passengers is over. Now it's all middle men,\" lamented one veteran Albanian smuggler in the port of Vlore. Often waiting in the destination country are representatives of the origin country boss, who will detain the migrants until relatives pay the outstanding debt. Alternatively, the migrants might be put to work in sweatshops or as prostitutes. \"They operate like companies, except they use violence and torture as means of persuasion,\" said Tana De Zulueta, an Italian senator. By such segmentation, specialisation and flexibility has human trafficking become the world's fastest growing criminal business. Employees know little, if anything, about their ultimate bosses. Identifying them, gathering evidence and obtaining convictions is a herculean task. Routes are well established: Chinese via Belgrade, where former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic was happy to generate visa payments and annoy the west; migrants and asylum seekers from the Middle East, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka via Sarajevo, where Bosnian authorities obliged fellow Muslims. Last year more than 50,000 are estimated to have passed through on the way to western Europe. Three overland routes snake into Italy and Austria via Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary. Suffocations in trucks and drownings in the Sava river are common. Others board semi-inflatables for moonlit crossings of the Adriatic from Vlore or Split. More than 130 drowned last year. An Anglo-Italian initiative will intensify pressure on Yugoslavia and Bosnia to clamp down. Hopeful of western aid, they have already started. Croatia and Slovenia are praised by the Home Office for their efforts. The long-term goal is to make the Balkans stable enough for asylum seekers to stay there. In the meantime, the government wants joint police operations to hunt down the bosses in the transit countries, one by one. An expanded role for Europol is envisaged. Wire taps, surveillance and informants are to penetrate the networks. The fall of Josip and Gloria Loncaric is cited as the way ahead. Police believe the networks have been left vulnerable by their expansion. \"Debriefing their clients can yield gems of information,\" said one British intelligence source. However, one Croatian investigator said: \"If we succeed in disrupting the networks they'll raise their prices to cover the costs. And clients will pay up, they always do.\" How net closed on a smuggler The rise and fall of a Sino-Balkan trafficking network has been hailed as a model breakthrough which European police and immigration authorities should study and replicate. Twenty years ago a Croatian taxi driver, Josip Loncaric, started delivering fruit and veg to the Italian border and branched out into smuggling people. When Yugoslavia broke up, demand and profit soared. Loncaric bought a fleet of cars and vans and transported hundreds of Albanians and Yugoslavs. Chinese criminals started importing countrymen into Trieste, in north-east Italy.

That changed in 1998 when anti-mafia specialists in Trieste joined forces with Slovenian and British investigators. Wire taps and surveillance led them to a Loncaric lieutenant, Tomo Fodor, who agreed to become an informant in return for leniency. Last July Slovenian police arrested Loncaric as dozens of accomplices were lifted in Italy. His wife was caught in Trieste in November. Both are expected to face trial this year.

If our party stands for anything it stands for natural justice and I hope I am allowed to benefit from that belief.</p> <p>\"All I want to do now is explain my actions and describe events in the light of new information that has emerged.\"</p> <p>A memo dated January 11 written by a Northern Ireland Office official - and leaked to the Sunday Times - records that Home Office minister Mike O'Brien was uncertain whether the telephone conversation with Mr Mandelson about SP Hinduja's passport application had taken place. The memo to Mr Mandelson reads: \"I am told that you raised the issue with Mike O'Brien either in a telephone call or a personal note. Mike O'Brien does not remember precisely how you raised it.\"</p> <p>A second typewritten note dated October 5 1998, from Mr O'Brien to Mr Mandelson concerning Mr Mandelson's questions over the Hinduja passport, also does not refer to a phone call, saying only \"you were in contact with my office last week\".</p> <p>After Mr Mandelson told the Observer that the contacts over the Hinduja passport had been through his private office, the home secretary Jack Straw subsequently contacted Number 10 to insist there had been a phone call. Following Mr Mandelson's resignation Mr O'Brien also gave interviews saying there had been a phone call between himself and Mr Mandelson.</p> <p>Mr Straw said the existence of the phone call made Mr Mandelson's resignation inevitable because an untruth had been told.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson's fate may now turn on whether there is clear documentary evidence in the Home Office that a phone call did occur.</p> <p>\"This is clearly a difficult situation for me and everyone else,\" Mr Mandelson told the Guardian yesterday. \"No doubt the Tory party would like me to be in a dangerous and volatile mood, but I am going to disappoint them.\"</p> <p>\"My frame of mind is quite different.

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson warned yesterday that Labour would be damaged if he was \"falsely branded as a liar\", but expressed confidence that those who had accused him of telling an untruth would realise their honest mistake once the facts became known. The ousted cabinet minister spoke exclusively to the Guardian after flying back from a week's break in the United States determined to clear his name, and buoyed by new memos casting doubt on the case against him. But he was also anxious to dismiss fears among ministers and government officials that he is in a dangerous and volatile mood and bent on revenge. He insisted he would be conciliatory and do nothing to harm the Labour party or his friends in politics. \"My party's interests mean everything to me, and they always have done,\" Mr Mandelson said. There had been reports that Mandelson was gunning for the head of the home civil service, Sir Richard Wilson, the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, and the Downing Street chief of staff Jonathan Powell. The three men were seen as responsible for deciding Mr Mandelson was guilty of misleading Number 10 over whether he had telephoned Mike O'Brien, the home office minister, to discuss a passport for Srichand Hinduja, the Indian billionaire. An inquiry, set up by the prime minister to review whether passport applications by SP and GP Hinduja were properly dealt with, has been criticised as a \"kangaroo court\", partly because of Sir Anthony's close links to the Home Office. But Mr Mandelson, who is due to meet his lawyers today to discuss the inquiry, said yesterday: \"I believe I can be confident in the objectivity of the Hammond inquiry. If our party stands for anything it stands for natural justice and I hope I am allowed to benefit from that belief. \"All I want to do now is explain my actions and describe events in the light of new information that has emerged.\" A memo dated January 11 written by a Northern Ireland Office official - and leaked to the Sunday Times - records that Home Office minister Mike O'Brien was uncertain whether the telephone conversation with Mr Mandelson about SP Hinduja's passport application had taken place. The memo to Mr Mandelson reads: \"I am told that you raised the issue with Mike O'Brien either in a telephone call or a personal note. Mike O'Brien does not remember precisely how you raised it.\" A second typewritten note dated October 5 1998, from Mr O'Brien to Mr Mandelson concerning Mr Mandelson's questions over the Hinduja passport, also does not refer to a phone call, saying only \"you were in contact with my office last week\". After Mr Mandelson told the Observer that the contacts over the Hinduja passport had been through his private office, the home secretary Jack Straw subsequently contacted Number 10 to insist there had been a phone call. Following Mr Mandelson's resignation Mr O'Brien also gave interviews saying there had been a phone call between himself and Mr Mandelson. Mr Straw said the existence of the phone call made Mr Mandelson's resignation inevitable because an untruth had been told. Mr Mandelson's fate may now turn on whether there is clear documentary evidence in the Home Office that a phone call did occur. \"This is clearly a difficult situation for me and everyone else,\" Mr Mandelson told the Guardian yesterday. \"No doubt the Tory party would like me to be in a dangerous and volatile mood, but I am going to disappoint them.\" \"My frame of mind is quite different. My colleagues are still my colleagues, my friends in politics are still my friends and I will do nothing to harm them or the party. The party's interests mean everything to me, they always have done.\" But, he added, in an apparent reference to Mr Straw and other ministers - such as the international development secretary Clare Short - who have accused him of not telling the truth: \"I do not think it's great for the party for me to be falsely branded as a liar, as someone who told an untruth. \"Those who believe this are mistaken - no doubt their mistake is an honest one, based on the facts as they saw them. But I hope they will look at all the circumstances and the chain of events again and realise the facts were not as they perceived them.\" Despite offers from both the BBC's Panorama and ITV's Trevor McDonald programme to put his side of the story, the former Northern Ireland secretary is planning to keep a low profile until the outcome of Sir Anthony's inquiry.

Ministers are acutely aware of the political sensitivity of the issue, with Conservatives already identifying unrelenting growth in the south- east, particularly plans for hundreds of thousands of new homes - and a deteriorating quality of life in the region as a key election issue. The findings from the lengthy planning inquiry into the case for a fifth terminal at Heathrow are now due to be in the hands of ministers although a decision is unlikely before the election. Nationally, government forecasts point to a doubling of traffic over the next 15 years with passenger volumes at British airports likely to rise to 333m in 2015 and to more than 400m by 2020. Any attempt by BAA, operator of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, to further expand south-east airports - or develop new ones, such as Alconbury in Cambridgeshire - will run into strong opposition from environmental groups, Conservatives and local councils. But business organisations, such as the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have urged ministers to bite the bullet and accept that fudging could seriously undermine Heathrow's position as the fourth busiest in the world. The chamber says runway capacity at all three London airports will be exhausted within 10 years. But Manchester Airport plc, owned by the 10 councils in Greater Manchester, is urging the government to adopt an alternative strategy - based on expansion in the Midlands and the north, where growing airports could provide a considerable boost to flagging local economies. It already owns Humberside airport and is poised to buy from the National Express group the fast-expanding East Midlands airport, which is vying with Stansted as the country's largest cargo airport. It has also set its sights on Newcastle airport and, being likely to buy Bournemouth airport, the company is poised to rival privatised BAA as Britain's second largest airport operator. Geoff Muirhead, chief executive of Manchester Airport, said it was preparing to overtake Gatwick as Britain's second-biggest airport by 2012. \"Millions of people travel to London for flights and millions from the north-west fly down to London [for them]. We have to grab those people and make direct flights from Manchester our priority.\"",

Last Wednesday's stroll down the boulevard of broken dreams attracted 10m viewers, 1.4m more than saw the ditching of Darius Danesh after his rendition of Britney Spears's Baby One More Time - which was quite possibly one of the ugliest moments on British television. </p> <p>Popstars is this season's Must-See TV, the first piece of watercooler television of the new year. It is the talk not just of the playground and student common room, but of offices, pubs, steamies and Age Concern day centres everywhere. Popstars can lay claim to being one of those old-fashioned, universal television hits. </p> <p>Combining soap-opera narrative with the candid cameras of reality TV and the old-fashioned talent show, Popstars appeals to both the viewer's kind heart and malicious mind. We applaud Claire, the Big Glaswegian Girl, for her determination and ambition, cry when she gets knocked out, and boo the arrogant Darius for his silly beard and sillier spiritual babble. We wish Warren well as he cries in the toilets and rue Raymond's penchant for port. We watch in slack-jawed disbelief as the tuneless prove they are just as inept at dancing - truly Stars In Their Minds - and we marvel at those who can get to that high note in Reach For The Stars. </p> <p>And we do it all from the safety of our sofas, envying the brass neck of those who were brave enough to give it a go. While the tagline on the Popstars website may be overstating things somewhat - \"Everyone wants to be a popstar\" - there can't be many of us who haven't thought about it, even if we only got as far as dancing in front of the mirror, hairbrush in hand, miming to Barry Manilow's Copacabana. </p> <p>Of course, the prize is the biggest lure of all, one which is potentially bigger than anything Chris Tarrant has to offer - national and perhaps international fame. Ask a class of seven or eight-year-olds what they want to be when they're older and rather than train drivers or astronauts, doctors or farmers, the majority will answer either a pop star or a footballer. Some might even be forthright and savvy enough to simply respond: \"I want to be famous.\" </p> <p>In a society which claims to be meritocratic, celebrity is seen as a way out of mediocrity. In a society in which Posh and Becks are idolised, is it any wonder there are recruitment crises in health care, law enforcement and education? Such professions simply don't present nearly enough opportunities to meet Madonna. </p> <p>Watching Popstars is a way of reminding yourself that the big hand of fate could appear from nowhere; it is vicarious adventure. To paraphrase Popstars' Suzanne, it's like getting yourself a lucky lottery ticket. </p> <p>Little surprise then that Popstars has also generated a level of unrelenting media interest, the like of which hasn't been seen since Big Brother. It should be remembered, however, that that show provided the press with rich pickings and near constant internet coverage, while Popstars is only on once or twice a week. </p> <p>Press interest centred immediately on the character of Nigel Lythgoe, LWT's flouncy-haired head of entertainment, and once the Guardian had solemnly declared him a \"cult figure\" (after just one programme), the tabloids had the excuse they needed to dive in. </p> <p>During the first three weeks of transmission, a torrent of torrid tales appeared. According to one particularly fanciful story in the Daily Star - which appears not to have been discouraged by an excited LWT publicity department - the harassed executive had resorted to changing his route home from work because of threats from rejected hopefuls. Then, as the series developed and characters emerged, stories moved on to the wannabe pop stars themselves. </p> <p>The Sunday Mirror revealed the \"secret\" location where the chosen band members were holed up, and they then had to be moved in a cloak-and-dagger operation to avoid the paparazzi. And when the Sunday People revealed the name of the final five, ITV network bosses hurriedly rescheduled subsequent programmes to bring the official unveiling forward. Extra repeats were scheduled for weekday nights, and a two-programme special aired last Saturday looking at the choosing of the final line-up. </p> <p>Today, the country's media is descending upon Heathrow airport in London for a (doubtless) frenzied press conference with Suzanne, Noel, Myleene, Danny and Kym - the final five. It has been an extraordinary media event, and one which is entering a whole new phase, with the rest of the series emulating the formula of MTV's does-what-it-says-on-the-tin, Making The Band. </p> <p>The show's success has even surprised ITV, which has been accused of under-ambition by scheduling at Saturday teatime. A peak-time, mid-week slot would almost certainly have guaranteed higher audience figures than Saturday early evening, but had the show bombed, it would have done so from a far greater height. </p> <p>ITV marketing bosses deny the charge, saying that Popstars has succeeded in its aim of delivering a strong audience into the key Saturday-night schedule. But John Hardie, director of marketing at the ITV network, concedes that from the first rushes of the auditions, ITV knew it had a hit. </p> <p>\"When you saw the raw footage of the auditions and people being rejected or accepted, you realised that this was something incredibly powerful and dramatic. We decided that we would go massive on it.\" </p> <p>As well they might. In New Zealand, where the format originated, Popstars was big, but once it crossed the Tasman Sea, it was huge. In 2000, it was one of Australia's biggest television shows and the band the show created, Bardot, went on to land a number one single and a number one album. The girl band - not to be confused with Bardo, the 1982 British Eurovision entry - have since embarked on national and Asia-wide tours, and their song, Higher Than Heaven, was used as the theme tune for Olympics coverage on Australian television. </p> <p>Realising that young viewers often dictate household viewing habits and that ITV wasn't courting the youth market as successfully as Channel 4 or BBC2 (its attempts at youth programming can resemble a drunken uncle dancing at a wedding reception), the network threw huge money at it. The \"Nigel, pick me\" posters became talking points themselves, as did the trailers which littered ITV for weeks before transmission. The strategy worked. </p> <p>But what does the band have to look forward to? After months of auditions, rehearsals and recording - and today's press conference - the real work starts now. While helped along by the fact they feature in what is essentially a twice-weekly hour-long advert for themselves and their wares, the band have, as the song says, many rivers to cross. For every S Club 7, there is a 911, so they should bear in mind the wise words of Karen Carpenter: \"We've only just begun.\" </p> <p>And whether anybody is actually drinking the juice that sponsors the show is anyone's guess. After watching Popstars, it's not a soft drink you need, it's a good stiff brandy. </p> <p>\u0095 Popstars, tonight, 11.30pm, ITV</p>",

And a stranger is indeed what he remained throughout his life - literally so, in that from 1947 he lived as a political refugee in France.

      "body": "<p>From a distance, with his full beard, his floppy hair and his milk-bottle spectacles, David Johansen resembles one of Michael Bentine's Potties, rather than someone who changed the face of modern music. </p> <p>Closer in, the 51-year-old Staten Islander's face is a patchwork of lines, more ram-raided than lived-in. Yet when he unleashes his Jaggeresque grin, he is once more the raffish whippersnapper who fronted the New York Dolls, the band that invented punk. </p> <p>Then there is his voice. A life time of chain-smoking and a love of the grandiloquent has deepened it to part drawl, part stomach rumble. On this rainy afternoon he sips tea at the bar of his hotel overlooking Hyde Park. \"Do you know,\" he says, \"I haven't got a thing on my mind. It's as blank as a fresh coating of snow. People always ask how I'm feeling. I say, 'OK', but I haven't really thought about it.\" </p> <p>In the late 1960s, the insurance salesman's son made his way to Manhattan, where he has lived ever since - for the past 15 years with his second wife, photographer Kate Simon. By 1972 he had dabbled in acting and sung in local bands, before being invited to join Actress, which mutated into the New York Dolls. </p> <p>\"The East Village was a hotbed of revolution - there were so many radical fringes,\" says Johansen. \"It was the dawn of feminism, of macro- biotics, of gay liberation; we took all those elements and put them into music. Everything was about liberation and how far you could go with it.\" New York had never seen anything like the Dolls. They dressed beyond mere gender, they covered songs by Sonny Boy Williamson and Otis Redding, they were briefly managed by Malcolm McLaren, and they drank and drugged their way to oblivion. </p> <p>\"Before us,\" growls Johansen, \"rock stars were in gilded cages and untouchable. I brought it down to the street: if I can do this, you can do this.\" </p> <p>The New York Dolls broke up in 1975 after two albums. Johansen fronted a live version of the band for another two years, then stumbled along as a solo performer until 1984. He lived close to an Irish bar called Tramps and spent so much time there that he thought he ought to make some money from it. So he invented a pompadoured alter ego, Buster Poindexter, and played on the quiet Monday evenings. Before long Poindexter was a local hero. </p> <p>\"At that time I was in a van 300 nights a year travelling back and forth across the States, sucking a bottle of gin opening for heavy metal acts in hockey rinks,\" he says. \"Soon, doing Poindexter weekly, I was making as much as I was on the road officiating at what I called Hitler Youth rallies. What was I doing it for? When I was Poindexter, I could say whatever I wanted. As lead-ins to songs, I extrapolated on odd scenarios, saying I went to a party with Noel Coward and [the reggae singer] Eek A Mouse. I started getting an audience who'd read a book.\" </p> <p>Actor Bill Murray was a fan (\"He was fascinated by these stories - he's a bit demented himself\") and invited Johansen to resurrect his dormant thespian career in Scrooged. A role in Married to the Mob and a host of television parts followed. \"I did Let It Ride with Richard Dreyfus; it was great because we were in Miami for the whole winter, but by the last week of the filming even the top actors were going, 'I'll never work again.' I was thinking, 'I can't wait to get out of here because I've got a gig.' Music is my love and to me acting is more mercenary. I don't pound the pavements for roles: if it happens, it happens. I hate that auditioning thing.\" </p> <p>Poindexter was not a clean-living creation. A decade ago, he hosted a TV series in Los Angeles and the lifestyle took its toll. \"You know when you read that someone has to leave a show or a tour because they had 'nervous exhaustion'? Well, I had one of those and discovered that I was quite close to death. I always assumed that my lifestyle was going to take me at an early age, but when it was actually occurring I was, 'Not yet!' I pulled back.\" He claims not to have touched alcohol or hard drugs since. Poindexter paid the bills and painting filled the hole left by drugs and drink. Last year, in Woodstock, Johansen had his first exhibition. </p> <p>\"I'm compelled to paint nearly every day. I just felt like making a painting, went out and bought paints and a canvas. Now it fulfils me creatively when I'm not doing music: it's something you can do by yourself and it's totally yours. It's a great adjunct to my life.\" </p> <p>The Bottom Line was another Manhattan den. The New York Dolls played there and Poindexter still does. Last year, to celebrate the club's 30th anniversary, regular acts were invited to put on an unusual performance. Johansen returned to the music of his youth, blues. He selected the songs and christened his three colleagues the Harry Smiths, after the occultist, film producer, folk anthologist and paper aeroplane collector who died in 1991 and whom Johansen briefly met in the late 1960s. \"If Harry Smith never existed, \u00e0 la It's A Wonderful Life, this would be a very different world to live in culturally,\" he says. </p> <p>After three days' rehearsal at Johansen's apartment, they played the Bottom Line. The New York Times adored it and another residency beckoned. Bob Dylan secured himself a tape of a show and, in now rare King of New York mode, tried to force his label to release it: \"Sony said, 'We knew you were insane and this proves it.' Dylan wanted to bat for this but I told him not to make me his cause celebre for the time being. Literally the next day, the Chesky label called, asking if I could make a record that week because they had studio time. We recorded it in a church smelling of dried old wood and incense. All my life I've hated being in a studio and in rooms without windows. I've always felt trapped. I've grown to accept it and not freak out or have anxiety attacks, but I'm totally spoilt now.\" </p> <p>Completing the circle, the often wondrous album David Johansen and the Harry Smiths featured Sonny Boy Williamson's Don't Start Me Talking, which the New York Dolls regularly covered. Once again, Johansen has become a standard-bearer of traditional American music. \"In New York they think of me as somebody who is doing something that will happen in five years, but everybody likes this record. A lot of stuff I do is fairly stubborn, and that's a character defect of mine, but I'm using a universal language in this particular area of my creativity.\" </p> <p>Someone dies in nearly every song on the album (\"I didn't do it on purpose - it just happened\") and three of the New York Dolls, Johnny Thunders, Jerry Nolan and Billy Murcia, went to an early grave. Death is all around Johansen, but if he feels guilt at being alive and if the ghosts of his bandmates call him as he drifts off each evening, he will not admit it. </p> <p>\"Guilt? No, I don't have any guilt.

      "bodyText": "From a distance, with his full beard, his floppy hair and his milk-bottle spectacles, David Johansen resembles one of Michael Bentine's Potties, rather than someone who changed the face of modern music. Closer in, the 51-year-old Staten Islander's face is a patchwork of lines, more ram-raided than lived-in. Yet when he unleashes his Jaggeresque grin, he is once more the raffish whippersnapper who fronted the New York Dolls, the band that invented punk. Then there is his voice. A life time of chain-smoking and a love of the grandiloquent has deepened it to part drawl, part stomach rumble. On this rainy afternoon he sips tea at the bar of his hotel overlooking Hyde Park. \"Do you know,\" he says, \"I haven't got a thing on my mind. It's as blank as a fresh coating of snow. People always ask how I'm feeling. I say, 'OK', but I haven't really thought about it.\" In the late 1960s, the insurance salesman's son made his way to Manhattan, where he has lived ever since - for the past 15 years with his second wife, photographer Kate Simon. By 1972 he had dabbled in acting and sung in local bands, before being invited to join Actress, which mutated into the New York Dolls. \"The East Village was a hotbed of revolution - there were so many radical fringes,\" says Johansen. \"It was the dawn of feminism, of macro- biotics, of gay liberation; we took all those elements and put them into music. Everything was about liberation and how far you could go with it.\" New York had never seen anything like the Dolls. They dressed beyond mere gender, they covered songs by Sonny Boy Williamson and Otis Redding, they were briefly managed by Malcolm McLaren, and they drank and drugged their way to oblivion. \"Before us,\" growls Johansen, \"rock stars were in gilded cages and untouchable. I brought it down to the street: if I can do this, you can do this.\" The New York Dolls broke up in 1975 after two albums. Johansen fronted a live version of the band for another two years, then stumbled along as a solo performer until 1984. He lived close to an Irish bar called Tramps and spent so much time there that he thought he ought to make some money from it. So he invented a pompadoured alter ego, Buster Poindexter, and played on the quiet Monday evenings. Before long Poindexter was a local hero. \"At that time I was in a van 300 nights a year travelling back and forth across the States, sucking a bottle of gin opening for heavy metal acts in hockey rinks,\" he says. \"Soon, doing Poindexter weekly, I was making as much as I was on the road officiating at what I called Hitler Youth rallies. What was I doing it for? When I was Poindexter, I could say whatever I wanted. As lead-ins to songs, I extrapolated on odd scenarios, saying I went to a party with Noel Coward and [the reggae singer] Eek A Mouse. I started getting an audience who'd read a book.\" Actor Bill Murray was a fan (\"He was fascinated by these stories - he's a bit demented himself\") and invited Johansen to resurrect his dormant thespian career in Scrooged. A role in Married to the Mob and a host of television parts followed. \"I did Let It Ride with Richard Dreyfus; it was great because we were in Miami for the whole winter, but by the last week of the filming even the top actors were going, 'I'll never work again.' I was thinking, 'I can't wait to get out of here because I've got a gig.' Music is my love and to me acting is more mercenary. I don't pound the pavements for roles: if it happens, it happens. I hate that auditioning thing.\" Poindexter was not a clean-living creation. A decade ago, he hosted a TV series in Los Angeles and the lifestyle took its toll. \"You know when you read that someone has to leave a show or a tour because they had 'nervous exhaustion'? Well, I had one of those and discovered that I was quite close to death. I always assumed that my lifestyle was going to take me at an early age, but when it was actually occurring I was, 'Not yet!' I pulled back.\" He claims not to have touched alcohol or hard drugs since. Poindexter paid the bills and painting filled the hole left by drugs and drink. Last year, in Woodstock, Johansen had his first exhibition. \"I'm compelled to paint nearly every day. I just felt like making a painting, went out and bought paints and a canvas. Now it fulfils me creatively when I'm not doing music: it's something you can do by yourself and it's totally yours. It's a great adjunct to my life.\" The Bottom Line was another Manhattan den. The New York Dolls played there and Poindexter still does. Last year, to celebrate the club's 30th anniversary, regular acts were invited to put on an unusual performance. Johansen returned to the music of his youth, blues. He selected the songs and christened his three colleagues the Harry Smiths, after the occultist, film producer, folk anthologist and paper aeroplane collector who died in 1991 and whom Johansen briefly met in the late 1960s. \"If Harry Smith never existed, \u00e0 la It's A Wonderful Life, this would be a very different world to live in culturally,\" he says. After three days' rehearsal at Johansen's apartment, they played the Bottom Line. The New York Times adored it and another residency beckoned. Bob Dylan secured himself a tape of a show and, in now rare King of New York mode, tried to force his label to release it: \"Sony said, 'We knew you were insane and this proves it.' Dylan wanted to bat for this but I told him not to make me his cause celebre for the time being. Literally the next day, the Chesky label called, asking if I could make a record that week because they had studio time. We recorded it in a church smelling of dried old wood and incense. All my life I've hated being in a studio and in rooms without windows. I've always felt trapped. I've grown to accept it and not freak out or have anxiety attacks, but I'm totally spoilt now.\" Completing the circle, the often wondrous album David Johansen and the Harry Smiths featured Sonny Boy Williamson's Don't Start Me Talking, which the New York Dolls regularly covered. Once again, Johansen has become a standard-bearer of traditional American music. \"In New York they think of me as somebody who is doing something that will happen in five years, but everybody likes this record. A lot of stuff I do is fairly stubborn, and that's a character defect of mine, but I'm using a universal language in this particular area of my creativity.\" Someone dies in nearly every song on the album (\"I didn't do it on purpose - it just happened\") and three of the New York Dolls, Johnny Thunders, Jerry Nolan and Billy Murcia, went to an early grave. Death is all around Johansen, but if he feels guilt at being alive and if the ghosts of his bandmates call him as he drifts off each evening, he will not admit it. \"Guilt? No, I don't have any guilt. I don't know why I'm alive but I know there's a reason for it,\" he shrugs, as cigarette ash drops unnoticed into his tea. \"Too often, though, I find myself walking down the street broke and with my collar up. Then I hear the sidewalk saxophonist going 'Doo doo doo' and I think that could be me. I'm getting to the age where I need a steady income.\" \u0095 The album David Johansen and the Harry Smiths is out now on Chesky.",

The German princess, exiled to Moscow to marry mad Grand Duke Peter, organises a coup and ascends the throne. Intrigue, adventure, and Marlene Dietrich imperious in Russian uniform. 1492: The Conquest Of Paradise (Ridley Scott, 1992) 2.30pm, Studio Scott's account of Columbus's voyage across the \"sea of darkness\" to the New World does full justice to the epic enterprise: an apparently madcap scheme issuing from the pragmatism of the Spanish court, where Sigourney Weaver's Queen Isabella holds sway. With its battle scenes of dreamlike savagery it treats the distant past with the style and energy of Scott's all-conquering Gladiator. Mrs Dalloway (Marleen Gorris, 1997) 3.35am, Sky Premier Vanessa Redgrave's Clarissa Dalloway, radiant politician's wife, is preparing for one of her famous parties, but wandering in reveries of youthful romance. In flashback, Natascha McElhone, as her younger self, is wooed by Peter (Alan Cox); and coming to the party is the mature, still ardent Peter (Michael Kitchen). Eileen Atkins' adaptation of Virginia Woolf's novel, in an elegantly evoked 20s London, is wistful and touching. The Shooting (Monte Hellman, 1967) 4.35am, FilmFour One of two extraordinary existential westerns created by Hellman and Jack Nicholson during a seven-week sojourn in the Utah desert, courtesy of $150,000 funding from their mentor Roger Corman. Millie Perkins sets a little band - bounty hunter Warren Oates, cowboy Will Hutchins and gunslinger Nicholson - on the trail of an unidentified man. It's a quest without reason in a brutal, near silent world. Paul Howlett Sports Live Skiing: The World Championships British Eurosport The second and final week of the World Championships starts with the men's combined title, decided over three races spread across the day. The competition hasn't disappointed so far, with fans being treated to exactly what they want: falls, surprises and home wins. America's Daron Rahlves has been the eyebrow-raiser so far, but a win today may be beyond him. Simon Burnton History Bounty Hunters 8pm, History Channel Starting with the modern-day USA's practice of paying rewards for the recapture of suspected felons who skip bail, this documentary delves into the origins of the bail system. Scenes stretching all the way back to medieval England are enthusiastically reconstructed, moving on to slave-trade America where a recaptured serf could be worth up to $450. The brutality and greed of the professional manhunters (at a time when a weekly wage was just a few dollars) are disapprovingly described. And are today's bounty hunters so far removed from their predecessors? Camilla Redmond",

Next you yell: \" Hellas Verona, segni per noi! \" I yell it with all my heart. Self-control ebbs away. \"Hellas Verona, score for us!\" Then the Curva Sud, the end of the stadium where the hardcore fans hang out, bursts into the triumphal march from Verdi's Aida. Only we sing: \" Al\u00e8, forza Verona al\u00e8, forza giallobl\u00f9, giallobl\u00f9, giallobl\u00f9! \" Because the team plays in blue and yellow. The moment the song breaks up, ten thousand arms are raised: \" Napoli, Napoli, vaffanculo. \" Fuck off, Napoli. The ritual insult is absolutely necessary. \" Roma vaffanculo, Vicenza vaffanculo, Juventus vaffanculo \": it's our pre-match warm-up.</p> <p>You sit down exhausted, pleased with yourself and trembling with nerves. There are 90 nail-biting minutes ahead, played as ever on the brink of the relegation zone. Serie A, where we are now, is paradiso , Serie B is purgatorio , Serie C is the inferno. The Italians have a way of mixing sport, bureaucracy and metaphysics. One Sunday at half-time, the guy beside me offers this word of wisdom: \"There are three things a man fears in life: the horns [meaning your wife has betrayed you], death and relegation.\" He sighs: \"The first two are inevitable but with the third you've got a chance.\" Have we really got a chance against Naples? They've just won three in a row. We've lost two and drawn one. \" Hellas Verona, vinci per noi!\"</p> <p>The team was formed almost a century ago in Verona's poshest school, the Liceo Classico Maffei. The game was still new to this part of the world. Preparing for their first match, the players didn't know what to call themselves. Then the Greek teacher, with an extraordinary sense of what football was to become - at least in Italy - suggested the name Hellas, the Greek word for patria , homeland, country. Your team becomes the expression of the community you belong to, the group that gives you your identity. And in Italy this homeland can only be local. \"Did you watch the national team last night?\" I ask a sports journalist. \"No,\" he replies, and explains, \"I'm a Brescia supporter.\"</p> <p>So for the boys in the Curva Sud, their hellas is Verona: \" Solo contro tutti, \" they shout. Alone against the world. And today, when the Napoli players come out on to the pitch in the freezing cold that's flowing down from the Alps, everybody puts on a small white mask, the kind dentists use, to protect against the presumed smell of unwashed Neapolitans. With fantastic bad taste, some fan club has provided them. It's a gesture of isolation, separation. This is the territory of the secessionist Lega Nord.</p> <p>But can this ever be my team, my home? The first times I sat in the Verona's Bentegodi stadium, I felt cold, indifferent. I was born in Manchester. I watched my first games at Old Trafford. I fell under the spell of the Stretford End. The Italian word for enchantment is incanto , which literally means \"into song\". You fall into the song, or chant, of the fans. It's an old story. Perhaps the best and briefest account I've ever read was sent to me by email the day after I first published an article on Hellas Verona's website (<a href=\"http://www.hellasverona.it\" target=\"_NEW\">www.hellasverona.it</a>). It came from one of those unlucky fans who live not where they love: \"My name is Eugenio, I'm from Asti, Piedmont, and my family is from Tuscany. One day, when I was small, they took me to see Juventus-Verona. I don't remember anything about the game. I spent the whole time watching the Brigate Giallobl\u00f9 [the hardcore always call themselves brigate , brigades]. They sent shivers up my spine. That night I decided that I would become one of them.\"</p> <p>Parents should definitely think twice when they choose which is to be their children's first football game. Enchanted by Hellas Verona, Eugenio has spent a fortune in petrol and train tickets over the past 20 years. \" Al\u00e8 forza Verona, al\u00e8 \" may not sound much like the song the sirens sung, but the effect seems to be the same. \"Yesterday I did a blood test,\" someone wrote to the club's website chatline, \"and I'm Hellas positive for ever.\"</p> <p>So how can you change allegiance, or infection? How did I find myself one Sunday afternoon chanting, \" Hellas Verona, vinci per noi \"? One of the least funny moments in Ali G's first video comes when he asks Major General Perkins whether a soldier never thinks of changing sides. \"Like I've always been with Man U,\" Ali says, \"but when I sees they aren't going to do the double, I goes over to the Arsenal.\" This simply doesn't work. There have probably been more soldiers who have changed sides this century than football fans.</p> <p>Maybe the example Ali should have used was girlfriends or wives. \"I sees me Julie in't lookin' fit so I finds meself a new bitch.\" Everybody knows how to split up and divorce. It was you who chose your wife, wasn't it, so why shouldn't you change her when she loses her charm? No one will be surprised. But switching from Man U to Arsenal would be a mutation of quite a different order. \"The players can come and go,\" sings the Curva Sud, \"the president and the trainer, but we will always be here, rain or shine, Brigate, Brigate Giallobl\u00f9.\"</p> <p>It was a game against Juventus that finally shifted something in my psyche. I'd been in Italy about 12 years by then (20 now). For a couple of seasons I had been a desultory spectator at the Bentegodi. I had the excuse of my son, Michele, who was now just about old enough to sit through a game. Anyhow, the ground was unusually full that day, and when Juventus scored I realised why. The Curva Nord, the \"guest area\", exploded with joy. That was to be expected. These people had bought their tickets in Turin. But then large areas of the more expensive stands were on their feet too, cheering and waving their black and white scarves. These people must be Veronese, born and bred. Yet they were supporting Juventus, a team synonymous with money and power - a team, in short, like Man U.</p> <p>The Curva Sud rose as one man, beside themselves with rage, hurling their bodies against the perimeter fences. \" Bastardi! \" they shrieked. \" Traditori! \" My son too, in his shrill voice, was shouting, \" Bastardi! \" He meant it. Verona is a small club, it needs all the help it can get. \"We know your names!\" the fans began to chant. \"We have your addresses!\"</p> <p>Then, caught up in the intensity of the emotions, I made a weird association. I have their addresses too, I thought. They are the addresses of all those well-to-do families whose children I gave English lessons to when I first arrived in Verona, families who paid late, cancelled at the last minute, asked if you had a proper hanger for their fur coats, departed without warning for Cortina or Buenos Aires and, in general, lived lives of enviable and obtuse complacency. People like that, I told myself, can't bring themselves to support a team that might go into Serie B, so they whore after the interminable success of the wealthy giants.</p> <p>It was a ridiculous association, of course. There is no reason to suppose that there is any relationship between the kind of families who hire an English teacher as a fashion accessory and people so insecure that they need to support a big team far away, or who merely, as tiny children, got taken to their first game in the wrong town. But, however absurd, the thought served to forge a sick link between an old personal resentment and the fortunes of Hellas Verona. In a moment I was on my feet beside my son, shouting, \" Juve, Juve, vaffanculo. \" Very soon I would stop bothering to tune into the World Service to see what United were up to. Verona had become my destiny.</p> <p>Today's game begins. Napoli are sharp and eager. They have the look of the team who know they can win. In the Curva Nord opposite us, their fans unfurl a banner that says: \"Veronese, laboratory mice.\" No one is quite sure what this is supposed to mean. The Veronese respond with an enthusiastic rendering of \" Brucia il meridione \" - \"Burn the south\" - this despite the fact that half of our players are southerners and quite probably many of those singing.</p> <p>By half-time, with the energy of desperation, Verona have taken over the game. On a sodden pitch, Napoli resort to the catenaccio , eight men in the box. They'll be happy with a draw. Their goalkeeper saves once, twice, three times. But football is par excellence the sport of those who thirst for injustice. Twelve minutes from time, just as Verona's pressure has reached its climax, Napoli hazard a counterattack. A shot from 30 yards curls inside the top corner. One-nil. \"Serie B, Serie B, Serie B,\" shriek the Neapolitans.</p> <p>How many times have I asked myself whether I haven't invested too much emotion in this sport? What gloom! I can't believe it. The circus of substitutions and time-wasting fouls begins. Betrayal, death, relegation. Until, to everybody's amazement, when all seems over, in a goalmouth scramble, Verona equalise. And in the second minute of injury time, they snatch the winner. Total euphoria. One Veronese player (Sicilian) is sent off for throwing his shirt in the air, another (Romanian) for punching an opponent. Meantime I and my son tumble over in a vast group embrace. \" Giallobl\u00f9, giallobl\u00f9, giallobl\u00f9!\" Never do I feel more at home in Italy than at the Stadio Bentegodi.</p> <p>\u0095 Tim Parks' monthly column, following the fortunes of Hellas Verona FC, begins in G2 next Tuesday. His latest book, Destiny, is published by Vintage Press, price \u00a36.99.</p>",

Maybe the example Ali should have used was girlfriends or wives. \"I sees me Julie in't lookin' fit so I finds meself a new bitch.\" Everybody knows how to split up and divorce. It was you who chose your wife, wasn't it, so why shouldn't you change her when she loses her charm? No one will be surprised. But switching from Man U to Arsenal would be a mutation of quite a different order. \"The players can come and go,\" sings the Curva Sud, \"the president and the trainer, but we will always be here, rain or shine, Brigate, Brigate Giallobl\u00f9.\" It was a game against Juventus that finally shifted something in my psyche. I'd been in Italy about 12 years by then (20 now). For a couple of seasons I had been a desultory spectator at the Bentegodi. I had the excuse of my son, Michele, who was now just about old enough to sit through a game. Anyhow, the ground was unusually full that day, and when Juventus scored I realised why. The Curva Nord, the \"guest area\", exploded with joy. That was to be expected. These people had bought their tickets in Turin. But then large areas of the more expensive stands were on their feet too, cheering and waving their black and white scarves. These people must be Veronese, born and bred. Yet they were supporting Juventus, a team synonymous with money and power - a team, in short, like Man U. The Curva Sud rose as one man, beside themselves with rage, hurling their bodies against the perimeter fences. \" Bastardi! \" they shrieked. \" Traditori! \" My son too, in his shrill voice, was shouting, \" Bastardi! \" He meant it. Verona is a small club, it needs all the help it can get. \"We know your names!\" the fans began to chant. \"We have your addresses!\" Then, caught up in the intensity of the emotions, I made a weird association. I have their addresses too, I thought. They are the addresses of all those well-to-do families whose children I gave English lessons to when I first arrived in Verona, families who paid late, cancelled at the last minute, asked if you had a proper hanger for their fur coats, departed without warning for Cortina or Buenos Aires and, in general, lived lives of enviable and obtuse complacency. People like that, I told myself, can't bring themselves to support a team that might go into Serie B, so they whore after the interminable success of the wealthy giants. It was a ridiculous association, of course. There is no reason to suppose that there is any relationship between the kind of families who hire an English teacher as a fashion accessory and people so insecure that they need to support a big team far away, or who merely, as tiny children, got taken to their first game in the wrong town. But, however absurd, the thought served to forge a sick link between an old personal resentment and the fortunes of Hellas Verona. In a moment I was on my feet beside my son, shouting, \" Juve, Juve, vaffanculo. \" Very soon I would stop bothering to tune into the World Service to see what United were up to. Verona had become my destiny. Today's game begins. Napoli are sharp and eager. They have the look of the team who know they can win. In the Curva Nord opposite us, their fans unfurl a banner that says: \"Veronese, laboratory mice.\" No one is quite sure what this is supposed to mean. The Veronese respond with an enthusiastic rendering of \" Brucia il meridione \" - \"Burn the south\" - this despite the fact that half of our players are southerners and quite probably many of those singing. By half-time, with the energy of desperation, Verona have taken over the game. On a sodden pitch, Napoli resort to the catenaccio , eight men in the box. They'll be happy with a draw. Their goalkeeper saves once, twice, three times. But football is par excellence the sport of those who thirst for injustice. Twelve minutes from time, just as Verona's pressure has reached its climax, Napoli hazard a counterattack. A shot from 30 yards curls inside the top corner. One-nil. \"Serie B, Serie B, Serie B,\" shriek the Neapolitans. How many times have I asked myself whether I haven't invested too much emotion in this sport? What gloom! I can't believe it. The circus of substitutions and time-wasting fouls begins. Betrayal, death, relegation. Until, to everybody's amazement, when all seems over, in a goalmouth scramble, Verona equalise. And in the second minute of injury time, they snatch the winner. Total euphoria. One Veronese player (Sicilian) is sent off for throwing his shirt in the air, another (Romanian) for punching an opponent. Meantime I and my son tumble over in a vast group embrace. \" Giallobl\u00f9, giallobl\u00f9, giallobl\u00f9!\" Never do I feel more at home in Italy than at the Stadio Bentegodi. \u0095 Tim Parks' monthly column, following the fortunes of Hellas Verona FC, begins in G2 next Tuesday. His latest book, Destiny, is published by Vintage Press, price \u00a36.99.",

It was an amazingly bold step for a time when it was much more of an elitist society than it is today.</p> <p>Lawton was educated at Battersea Grammar School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. There, he became involved in fascist politics, and in 1936 was adopted as the British Union of Fascists' candidate for Hammersmith North.

He served in the war with the London Irish Rifles before being invalided out in 1941 following an accident in training.</p> <p>Called to the Bar as a member of Inner Temple in 1935, he had been pupilled to JP Eddy, a man regarded as an excellent pleader but one who did no criminal work. He then had the fortune to join Lord Birkett's chambers where, little by little, he established a criminal practice. In his latter days as a junior, Lawton practised more in the civil courts but then found that, as a silk, he could make more money doing criminal cases. In his last years at the Bar most of his civil work was in defamation. He was highly thought of as a pupil-master, and those who passed through his hands included Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>He was appointed silk, something he believed he owed to Norman Birkett, in 1957, the year he became a member of the Bar Council, which he served for 14 years. From that year, until 1961, he was recorder of the city of Cambridge, and in 1968 he became deputy chairman of Cornwall quarter sessions, holding the post until it was abolished three years later. Cornwall was one of the few places where solicitors could appear at quarter sessions, and Lawton found the standard of advocacy of the senior partners of local firms perfectly adequate while noting that contested cases were often handled by the less experienced assistants.

(The first Kray trial, presided over by Justice Melford Stevenson, had ended with the convictions in 1969 for the murders of Jack \"The Hat\" McVitie and George Cornell by Reggie and Ronnie Kray respectively.) The second case involved the death of Frank Mitchell whom the Krays helped escape from Dartmoor prison. The prosecution alleged that they had ordered his murder</p> <p>These were the days before the Contempt of Court Act of 1981 which allowed judges to blackout the reporting of trials for months on end. Lawton was faced with the problem that, after the first trial, certain newspapers had written profiles of the Krays in unflattering terms.

His secretary of state, Colin Powell, said yesterday that his personal views differed from White House policy. When asked on ABC's This Week whether he supported the policy, he replied: \"It is the policy. \"I have other views that are my personal views, but this is the policy of the government.\" Unlike many Republicans, Mr Powell defends a woman's right to choose an abortion. In response to Mr Bush's ruling, Britain and its EU partners are poised to fill some of the gap. This year's funding is unaffected, but the UN Population Fund and the International Planned Parenthood Federation are likely to suffer badly later on, as will many other groups. About 80,000 women die annually from unsafe abortions. EU sources said the European Commission, the world's biggest overseas aid donor, could not provide core funding but it could support individual projects. Clare Short, the international development secretary, is due to discuss the matter with the EU commissioner for development, Poul Nielson, in London this week. Ms Short wants to avoid a row with the US but is anxious for Britain to play an active role in population policy, officials said. Her Dutch colleague, Eveline Herfkens, has also urged a \"quick and strong\" European response to Mr Bush's cuts.

      "bodyText": "The inhabitants of a Caribbean island which the US navy has used for 60 years as a bombing range, including firing depleted uranium shells, are seeking $100m (\u00a368m) in damages for an abnormally high cancer rate. Figures compiled in 1990-94 show that the 9,300 islanders of Vieques are 27% more likely to get cancer than those on Puerto Rico, just to the west. But Dr Rafael Rivera-Castao, who lives on the island, says the rate has risen since then. \"I estimate that the cancer rate here is now 52% more than the Puerto Rico average.\" The navy says the island offers the only terrain suitable for its military exercises. John Arthur Eaves, the lawyer pressing for damages for one-third of islanders, said \"I think $100m may turn out to be at the lower end of the scale of what we might get from the navy. \"We have already spent $7m on preparing this case, which we wouldn't have done if we didn't think we had a very good chance of winning.\" Nilda Medina, of the Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques, said: \"For years we have denounced the relationship between the military contamination and the exaggerated levels of cancer on Vieques. \"The heavy metals and other chemical components from explosives dangerous to human health combined with the radioactive uranium projectiles jeopardise the life of Viequenses today as well as future generations.\" There was no way to guarantee that the next bomb would not hit one of the uranium shells, dispersing radioactive particles into the air. Vieques became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre 21 months ago after a misdirected shell killed a civilian security guard, and became the catalyst for a re-examination of Puerto Rican relations with the US. Puerto Rico has been a territory for more than a century and its commonwealth status gives islanders US citizenship, albeit with reduced rights and duties: they cannot vote in presidential elections and do not have to pay federal taxes. In the most recent referendum on the issue they rejected the idea of becoming the 51st state, but few of them have any interest in independence, despite a new Puerto Rican self-confidence reflected in the success of its sportsmen and such musicians as Ricky Martin. Anti-American slogans are daubed throughout Vieques, an 18-mile long island on which civilians are confined to the middle third. Yesterday, as every Sunday, protesters rallied in the main town, Isabel Segunda, before driving in a convoy around the island blowing car horns and protesting through loudhailers. Quite apart from the indignity of their existence on a virtually occupied land, they claim that the navy's presence prevents the development of the island, where tourism is among the few sources of income. The bombing was halted after the death of the security guard when dissidents camped out on the range, defying the US and its allies, including Britain, to carry on. They were removed last May after an agreement with Bill Clinton for a referendum in November on whether the navy should stay or go in 2003. President Bush, eager to show empathy with Hispanics, said he would respect the deal. Bombing resumed last year, but with dummy shells. Puerto Rico's new governor, Sila Calderon, who took office last month, campaigned on an anti-navy platform and tried to persuade Mr Clinton in the last days of he presidency to halt the bombing for good.

But it was the goats introduced to the Galapagos by the early settlers that really did it for George's clan, destroying the ecological balance on the islands, 600 miles from mainland Ecuador, where it evolved over millennia. By the time George was discovered rearing programmes were replenishing the gene pool of other tortoise sub-species, but his case was different. Unless a mate could be found his group faced extinction. George was taken to the Charles Darwin Research Centre on Santa Cruz island and provided with a harem from related sub-species, but he was just not interested. Thirty years later the last Geochelone elephantopus abingdoni is as lonesome as ever. Pepe grew up on San Cristobal island in the 1920s, in an era when it was common to whip baby tortoises out of their natural habitat and take them home. In 1959 the Galapagos National Park was formed and park officials rounded up all the domesticated tortoises they could find. All, that is, except Pepe, who was by then in the charge of Franciscan missionaries, who were allowed to keep him. Eventually he became the island's mascot, and he lumbered around freely until the early 90s, when tourism began to interfere with his routine. Since then he has lived in a small enclosure, where younger visitors ride on his saddle-shaped back.",

      "body": "<p>It is said to be the fervent wish of Sir Anthony Hammond, who is conducting the inquiry into the Hinduja affair, that the rest of the world would shut up and let him get on with his job. Some hope. Two issues combined this weekend to make that impossible. One was the agitation over the foreign office minister Keith Vaz, which was fuelled by a cascade of fresh allegations in the Sunday newspapers. The other was the controversy over the forced resignation of Peter Mandelson, which was fuelled by Peter Mandelson and his friends.</p> <p>The Vaz affair now closely resembles repeated press campaigns during John Major's government, when tabloid newspapers went after erring ministers and refused to relent until they had got their scalps. The charges against him this weekend were many and lurid, ranging from allegations (strongly denied) about money gone missing in his constituency party to reports that the minister was about to resign, or that colleagues had urged him to go. Some of these are Hinduja-linked, and therefore Sir Anthony's territory; others would rather belong to the continuing inquiry into Mr Vaz's activities by the parliamentary ombudsman, Elizabeth Filkin. Already firmly defended by Tony Blair, Mr Vaz was even more stoutly championed yesterday by his boss at the Foreign Office, Robin Cook, who complained of innuendo and guilt by association, and suggested that Mr Vaz's real offence in the eyes of his persecutors was his enthusiasm for Europe. But that will not wash. If and when the truth is disentangled from the fantasy and fabrication, it may well become clear that the networking for which Mr Vaz is famous took him into territory which wiser men would have avoided.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the matter of Peter Mandelson, which had fallen quiet at the end of last week, was brought back to the boil, partly by the fallen minister himself but more by the assiduous friend who has cast himself as Emile Zola to Mandelson's Dreyfus: the novelist Robert Harris. \"Nothing I will ever do will ever be designed to harm the government or the party\" Mr Mandelson told the Independent on Sunday. But that misses the point. The Titanic was never designed to strike an iceberg and sink on its maiden voyage, but miscalculations in steersmanship sank it nevertheless. And Mr Harris's attack on the former Home Office man chosen to head the inquiry - \"can anyone seriously believe he is going to exonerate Mandelson, with all the vast embarrassment for the home secretary that would entail?\" - sits oddly with Mr Mandelson's own promise to await Sir Anthony's verdict in the confidence that his name will be cleared.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson's friends can hardly expect Tony Blair to declare at this stage: \"I was wrong. It's all been a huge, appalling mistake. I want Peter back in my government instantly\". Any outcome now which shows that the minister was unjustly treated will harm the reputation of Mr Blair and his government; but an instant recantation would ruin it. Mr Mandelson's interview with the Guardian today suggests a cooler approach. Both Dreyfus and Zola should stick to it.</p> <p><b>Special report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,430876,00.html\">30.01.2001: Steve Bell on Labour's reaction to Mandelson's resignation</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,428461,00.html\">Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430740,00.html\">30.01.2001: It was Alastair Campbell who led an iniquitous panic</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430828,00.html\">30.01.2001: MI6 drawn into Hinduja passport row</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430669,00.html\">30.01.2001: A Whitehall farce </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,430305,00.html\">29.01.2001: Cabinet cuts off Mandelson</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430254,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430250,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430253,00.html\">29.01.2001: Brother deals new blow to Vaz</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430189,00.html\">29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430167,00.html\">29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429979,00.html\">28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say on the Mandelson affair</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/01/28/stifocnws02001.html\" target=\"_new\">Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street press briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "It is said to be the fervent wish of Sir Anthony Hammond, who is conducting the inquiry into the Hinduja affair, that the rest of the world would shut up and let him get on with his job. Some hope. Two issues combined this weekend to make that impossible. One was the agitation over the foreign office minister Keith Vaz, which was fuelled by a cascade of fresh allegations in the Sunday newspapers. The other was the controversy over the forced resignation of Peter Mandelson, which was fuelled by Peter Mandelson and his friends. The Vaz affair now closely resembles repeated press campaigns during John Major's government, when tabloid newspapers went after erring ministers and refused to relent until they had got their scalps. The charges against him this weekend were many and lurid, ranging from allegations (strongly denied) about money gone missing in his constituency party to reports that the minister was about to resign, or that colleagues had urged him to go. Some of these are Hinduja-linked, and therefore Sir Anthony's territory; others would rather belong to the continuing inquiry into Mr Vaz's activities by the parliamentary ombudsman, Elizabeth Filkin. Already firmly defended by Tony Blair, Mr Vaz was even more stoutly championed yesterday by his boss at the Foreign Office, Robin Cook, who complained of innuendo and guilt by association, and suggested that Mr Vaz's real offence in the eyes of his persecutors was his enthusiasm for Europe. But that will not wash. If and when the truth is disentangled from the fantasy and fabrication, it may well become clear that the networking for which Mr Vaz is famous took him into territory which wiser men would have avoided. Meanwhile, the matter of Peter Mandelson, which had fallen quiet at the end of last week, was brought back to the boil, partly by the fallen minister himself but more by the assiduous friend who has cast himself as Emile Zola to Mandelson's Dreyfus: the novelist Robert Harris. \"Nothing I will ever do will ever be designed to harm the government or the party\" Mr Mandelson told the Independent on Sunday. But that misses the point. The Titanic was never designed to strike an iceberg and sink on its maiden voyage, but miscalculations in steersmanship sank it nevertheless. And Mr Harris's attack on the former Home Office man chosen to head the inquiry - \"can anyone seriously believe he is going to exonerate Mandelson, with all the vast embarrassment for the home secretary that would entail?\" - sits oddly with Mr Mandelson's own promise to await Sir Anthony's verdict in the confidence that his name will be cleared. Mr Mandelson's friends can hardly expect Tony Blair to declare at this stage: \"I was wrong. It's all been a huge, appalling mistake. I want Peter back in my government instantly\". Any outcome now which shows that the minister was unjustly treated will harm the reputation of Mr Blair and his government; but an instant recantation would ruin it. Mr Mandelson's interview with the Guardian today suggests a cooler approach. Both Dreyfus and Zola should stick to it.

      "body": "<p>The Israeli electorate has a momentous choice to make tomorrow. All the signs are that it is going to make the wrong one. Few seem to doubt that Ariel Sharon will be the country's next prime minister; the residual question exercising pollsters is the margin of his victory. Sadly, Mr Sharon needs no introduction. From his infamous role in the 1982 Lebanon invasion to his deliberately provocative, personal intrusion into Arab East Jerusalem last September, the ex-general and Likud leader has been a consistently prominent foe to peace, a confrontational rejectionist to match the hardest of Hamas or Hizbullah hardliners.</p> <p>His election platform places \"security\" before all else and demands an absolute end to all Palestinian violence (as defined by himself) before any talks about anything at all with Yasser Arafat's representatives can proceed. Mr Sharon would effectively scrap all the work that has been done before and since last July's Camp David summit, freezing the peace process and petrifying the status quo in the occupied territories. He has already commenced verbal hostilities with Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, the leading Arab \"moderate\". His predicted triumph already has Syrian commentators claiming that Damascus was right all along to oppose a deal with the \"Zionist entity\". Iraq's Saddam Hussein, who thrives on polarisation, must be hoping Mr Sharon wins big-time. At home, Ehud Barak's would-be nemesis has been busy courting the ultra-Orthodox parties, reportedly promising to safeguard their divisive privileges and narrow, inward-looking interests against the prime minister's mooted secular \"civil revolution\".</p> <p>For these among other reasons, Mr Sharon is the wrong choice tomorrow. But, voters may cry, how can we support Barak? In his strategy for dealing with the Palestinians, he is commonly held to have been duped. He has made no progress with the new Syrian leader; his Lebanon withdrawal last year brought no Jordanian-style rapprochement with Beirut. After less than two years in the job, he is seen as inconsistent and impulsive, an unbiddable loner who never understood the party political game, who failed to deliver his promises to boost education and jobs, and while trying to appeal direct to the people, seemed to have lost their address. Never mind that Mr Barak was severely handicapped by Israel's anarchic multiparty system and impractical elections laws. And never mind the significant, albeit inconclusive progress that was made. In their disappointment, Israeli voters forget that Mr Barak moved his country closer than any previous leader to a historic overall agreement finally securing the borders of the Jewish state and officially ending its \"war\" with the Arabs.</p> <p>It is this same nationally shared forgetfulness that may account for current reported voter apathy, despite the crucial nature of this choice. It is this collective amnesia that condemns (and readily shoots down) rock-throwing Palestinian teenagers, oblivious to the violence and excess that repeatedly attended Israel's own fight to establish and defend its right to independent existence. It is a forgetfulness that blames Mr Arafat, blames US mediators and the UN, blames meddling Europeans, blames blind hate and history, but never seems to recognise each individual Israeli's present responsibility for the injustices of the past for which Israel was itself to blame. Until Israelis, instead of running to hide behind the likes of Mr Sharon, fully understand and accept, once and for all, the need to give ground and make amends, there will be no \"security\", no peace - and no rest.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli electorate has a momentous choice to make tomorrow. All the signs are that it is going to make the wrong one. Few seem to doubt that Ariel Sharon will be the country's next prime minister; the residual question exercising pollsters is the margin of his victory. Sadly, Mr Sharon needs no introduction. From his infamous role in the 1982 Lebanon invasion to his deliberately provocative, personal intrusion into Arab East Jerusalem last September, the ex-general and Likud leader has been a consistently prominent foe to peace, a confrontational rejectionist to match the hardest of Hamas or Hizbullah hardliners. His election platform places \"security\" before all else and demands an absolute end to all Palestinian violence (as defined by himself) before any talks about anything at all with Yasser Arafat's representatives can proceed. Mr Sharon would effectively scrap all the work that has been done before and since last July's Camp David summit, freezing the peace process and petrifying the status quo in the occupied territories. He has already commenced verbal hostilities with Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, the leading Arab \"moderate\". His predicted triumph already has Syrian commentators claiming that Damascus was right all along to oppose a deal with the \"Zionist entity\". Iraq's Saddam Hussein, who thrives on polarisation, must be hoping Mr Sharon wins big-time. At home, Ehud Barak's would-be nemesis has been busy courting the ultra-Orthodox parties, reportedly promising to safeguard their divisive privileges and narrow, inward-looking interests against the prime minister's mooted secular \"civil revolution\". For these among other reasons, Mr Sharon is the wrong choice tomorrow. But, voters may cry, how can we support Barak? In his strategy for dealing with the Palestinians, he is commonly held to have been duped. He has made no progress with the new Syrian leader; his Lebanon withdrawal last year brought no Jordanian-style rapprochement with Beirut. After less than two years in the job, he is seen as inconsistent and impulsive, an unbiddable loner who never understood the party political game, who failed to deliver his promises to boost education and jobs, and while trying to appeal direct to the people, seemed to have lost their address. Never mind that Mr Barak was severely handicapped by Israel's anarchic multiparty system and impractical elections laws. And never mind the significant, albeit inconclusive progress that was made. In their disappointment, Israeli voters forget that Mr Barak moved his country closer than any previous leader to a historic overall agreement finally securing the borders of the Jewish state and officially ending its \"war\" with the Arabs. It is this same nationally shared forgetfulness that may account for current reported voter apathy, despite the crucial nature of this choice. It is this collective amnesia that condemns (and readily shoots down) rock-throwing Palestinian teenagers, oblivious to the violence and excess that repeatedly attended Israel's own fight to establish and defend its right to independent existence. It is a forgetfulness that blames Mr Arafat, blames US mediators and the UN, blames meddling Europeans, blames blind hate and history, but never seems to recognise each individual Israeli's present responsibility for the injustices of the past for which Israel was itself to blame. Until Israelis, instead of running to hide behind the likes of Mr Sharon, fully understand and accept, once and for all, the need to give ground and make amends, there will be no \"security\", no peace - and no rest.",

Shouldn't he have learned by now that he can't rewrite history with another vacuous sound bite?</p> <p>In the last 16 years many facts have emerged to disprove the Tories' concerted campaign of disinformation and outright lies, but for the sake of brevity two facts should suffice. First, throughout the strike, the NUM president represented the democratic decisions of the union members who elected him. And second \"the Ridley plan\" has been proven as a secret and carefully coordinated strategy to destroy the coal industry, initiated long before the NUM responded with industrial action.</p> <p>There are probably a few members of the parliamentary Labour party who'd be better able to talk to Peter Mandelson about \"betrayal\". But unless the national Labour party publicly dissociates itself from his comment, I'm sure many of the millions who supported the miners in 84-85 will see this as one betrayal too many. Living as I do in the marginal constituency of Enfield Southgate, unless I am assured otherwise, I will no longer vote for a party which supports such an outrageous view of a struggle I am proud to have been part of. <br><b>Anne Thomas</b><br>Former chair, Enfield Miners' Support Group <a href=\"mailto:anne.thomas@blueyonder.co.uk\">anne.thomas@blueyonder.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 So Peter Mandelson will fight the election by championing \"the achievements of the most successful Labour government in history\".</p> <p>Has he forgotten Attlee's postwar Labour government, which: a) recovered from a dreadful war; b) set up the NHS; c) found state money to abolish secondary school fees and raise the school leaving age; d) saved the railways and coal mines from collapse by investing public money when private money was withheld; e) built the Royal Festival Hall with public money (compare with the dome); f) commissioned Britten to write Billy Budd; and much more.</p> <p>The memory of Mandelson, grandson of Herbert Morrison, shows no sign of improving.<br><b>Ron Wallace</b><br>Hitchin, Herts</p> <p>\u0095 Most of us enjoy a good conspiracy theory and the Hinduja affair is generating its fair share (Was there a plot to get rid of Mandelson?, February 2). To add to such theories, in whose interest is it to cast aspersions on Sir Richard Wilson, head of the civil service and cabinet secretary, who is the one person in this affair unable to answer back ?</p> <p>Reportedly Sir Richard was asked by the prime minister to ascertain what was known at that point about the now infamous phone call. I don't know whether or not this is true, but whatever the case it was for the prime minister to determine any further action. Sir Richard has always been a staunch and vocal advocate of civil service impartiality and would have undertaken this task, as he does any other, within that framework.</p> <p>We will all hopefully be wiser once Sir Anthony Hammond has reported. In the meantime, the government should now accept the recommendation of July 2000 from Lord Neill that the prime minister should become the ultimate judge of the requirements of the ministerial code instead of prevaricating as it did in its response last year. This would be helpful, not only to the government but to senior civil servants. <br><b>Jonathan Baume</b><br>General secretary, Association of First Division Civil Servants</p>",

      "bodyText": "You quote Peter Mandelson (Scargill to take on Mandelson, February 3) as claiming that \"Arthur Scargill is the man who destroyed the coal industry and betrayed every man and woman in Britain in the process\". Shouldn't he have learned by now that he can't rewrite history with another vacuous sound bite? In the last 16 years many facts have emerged to disprove the Tories' concerted campaign of disinformation and outright lies, but for the sake of brevity two facts should suffice. First, throughout the strike, the NUM president represented the democratic decisions of the union members who elected him. And second \"the Ridley plan\" has been proven as a secret and carefully coordinated strategy to destroy the coal industry, initiated long before the NUM responded with industrial action. There are probably a few members of the parliamentary Labour party who'd be better able to talk to Peter Mandelson about \"betrayal\". But unless the national Labour party publicly dissociates itself from his comment, I'm sure many of the millions who supported the miners in 84-85 will see this as one betrayal too many. Living as I do in the marginal constituency of Enfield Southgate, unless I am assured otherwise, I will no longer vote for a party which supports such an outrageous view of a struggle I am proud to have been part of. Anne Thomas Former chair, Enfield Miners' Support Group anne.thomas@blueyonder.co.uk \u0095 So Peter Mandelson will fight the election by championing \"the achievements of the most successful Labour government in history\". Has he forgotten Attlee's postwar Labour government, which: a) recovered from a dreadful war; b) set up the NHS; c) found state money to abolish secondary school fees and raise the school leaving age; d) saved the railways and coal mines from collapse by investing public money when private money was withheld; e) built the Royal Festival Hall with public money (compare with the dome); f) commissioned Britten to write Billy Budd; and much more. The memory of Mandelson, grandson of Herbert Morrison, shows no sign of improving. Ron Wallace Hitchin, Herts \u0095 Most of us enjoy a good conspiracy theory and the Hinduja affair is generating its fair share (Was there a plot to get rid of Mandelson?, February 2). To add to such theories, in whose interest is it to cast aspersions on Sir Richard Wilson, head of the civil service and cabinet secretary, who is the one person in this affair unable to answer back ? Reportedly Sir Richard was asked by the prime minister to ascertain what was known at that point about the now infamous phone call. I don't know whether or not this is true, but whatever the case it was for the prime minister to determine any further action. Sir Richard has always been a staunch and vocal advocate of civil service impartiality and would have undertaken this task, as he does any other, within that framework. We will all hopefully be wiser once Sir Anthony Hammond has reported. In the meantime, the government should now accept the recommendation of July 2000 from Lord Neill that the prime minister should become the ultimate judge of the requirements of the ministerial code instead of prevaricating as it did in its response last year. This would be helpful, not only to the government but to senior civil servants. Jonathan Baume General secretary, Association of First Division Civil Servants",

This was no sinister conspiracy to set the party stamp on Westminster - merely an attempt to make a very tedious job more interesting. </p> <p>Odd as it may seem, the old school of Commons secretaries are not that interested in politics. They will vote in elections for the party of the MP they work for, but they do so out of loyalty as much as conviction. </p> <p>The job itself is hard. Offices at Westminster are uncomfortable and cramped and are not a place for tech-heads. They never really came to terms with the fax, and have been slow to embrace email. The work of the secretary involves letters, and more letters: letters from constituents aggrieved at the failure to obtain planning permission for their gazebos, or angry about the euro, plus a sprinkling who've been abducted by aliens. All must be replied to. </p> <p>The money is not fantastic. The MP's secretarial allowance of \u00a351,572 usually pays at least two secretaries, and perhaps the travel expenses of unpaid researchers. \"I could earn far more in the private sector,\" the secretary of a shadow cabinet minster once told me. But she works for her husband. Such partnerships are not unusual. </p> <p>Old-school secretaries have usually been recruited by word of mouth, and go from one MP to another as retirements and lost elections dictate. This is an enclosed world, where reptutations are built up, and there is some competition when an assistant becomes available. After Michael Portillo lost his seat in 1997, his secretary found a new job in the Commons within hours rather than days. </p> <p>The Commons secretary is the link to the constituency, the local party, the local people and their problems. A secretary who knows the constituency well is probably worth several thousand votes, significant in a marginal. In a few months we will see how the new breed have coped.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A new breed of secretary emerged in the House of Commons following Labour's election in 1997. The role became more political, involving research and campaigning. This was no sinister conspiracy to set the party stamp on Westminster - merely an attempt to make a very tedious job more interesting. Odd as it may seem, the old school of Commons secretaries are not that interested in politics. They will vote in elections for the party of the MP they work for, but they do so out of loyalty as much as conviction. The job itself is hard. Offices at Westminster are uncomfortable and cramped and are not a place for tech-heads. They never really came to terms with the fax, and have been slow to embrace email. The work of the secretary involves letters, and more letters: letters from constituents aggrieved at the failure to obtain planning permission for their gazebos, or angry about the euro, plus a sprinkling who've been abducted by aliens. All must be replied to. The money is not fantastic. The MP's secretarial allowance of \u00a351,572 usually pays at least two secretaries, and perhaps the travel expenses of unpaid researchers. \"I could earn far more in the private sector,\" the secretary of a shadow cabinet minster once told me. But she works for her husband. Such partnerships are not unusual. Old-school secretaries have usually been recruited by word of mouth, and go from one MP to another as retirements and lost elections dictate. This is an enclosed world, where reptutations are built up, and there is some competition when an assistant becomes available. After Michael Portillo lost his seat in 1997, his secretary found a new job in the Commons within hours rather than days. The Commons secretary is the link to the constituency, the local party, the local people and their problems. A secretary who knows the constituency well is probably worth several thousand votes, significant in a marginal. In a few months we will see how the new breed have coped.",

      "body": "<p>Court number one at the Old Bailey is crowded. The trial of David Mulcahy for multiple rapes and murders is drawing to a close. The crimes of which this man has been accused are so grotesque that members of the jury have been visibly shaken by the details. The air prickles with anticipation about the imminent verdict.</p> <p>In the public gallery, Mulcahy's friends and foes alike are breathing a little faster. He looks relaxed in the dock, scribbling furiously in an A4 notebook. With his glossy, mousy hair neatly cut, his cheap grey suit and bland face, he could easily be a middle manager from M&amp;S.</p> <p>In one corner of the gallery, a woman fixes the defendant with a stare. Jess (not her real name) is writing too. She is deeply absorbed in the trial because Mulcahy is the man to whom she says she lost her life.</p> <p>Mulcahy's friend John Duffy was jailed for murder in 1988. Ten years later, he confessed to other, similar offences and implicated his old schoolfriend in many of them. On Friday, Mulcahy was given three life sentences for murdering Alison Day, 19, from east London, Dutch schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer, 15, in Horsley, Surrey and Anne Lock, 29, at Brookmans Park, Hertfordshire. He was also convicted of seven rapes and five attempted rapes, in what was called the worst series of rapes and murders this country has ever witnessed.</p> <p>Jess was raped by Mulcahy in 1983, slap bang in the middle of a rape spree the men described as \"going out hunting\". Mulcahy has not been charged with raping Jess, although she went straight to the police afterwards. A police doctor collected forensic evidence and prescribed her the morning after pill, then she heard nothing. Four years later, police invited her to an identity parade where she picked out Mulcahy - but again she heard nothing.</p> <p>When the case was reopened in 1998 following Duffy's confession, Jess thought the details of the crime against her would at last be aired in court. But in July the Crown Prosecution Service told her that in her case there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The forensic evidence from the night of the rape had not been passed on by the police. So Jess sat discreetly in the public gallery, conducting her own private cross-examination of Mulcahy.</p> <p>\"At first I was terribly nervous about seeing him and the first time he made eye contact, I just looked away. But I became bolder and started to stare him out. When he was questioned about identity parades, I stared really hard at him. He fumbled a bit and said that nothing significant had emerged.</p> <p>\"So many details of the rapes were identical to mine. When the woman in the witness box began to cry, I cried too, because I felt totally empathetic with her, even physically. The two men burned some of the women after they had killed them and soon after the jury were shown forensic evidence of charred limbs, I came out in a rash. When it came to the evidence about the murders and the box the rape victims had testified in was empty, I felt desperately sad.\"</p> <p>It was in July 1983 that Jess was raped. She was a gifted arts student about to complete her university degree. She was walking briskly down a south London street at around 11pm on her way to visit her boyfriend when a man asked her the time. Twenty yards further down the road, another man grabbed her from behind, placed his arm around her neck and held a knife to her back.</p> <p>In a state of terror, she was dragged off the road and down on to a piece of land next to railway sidings. \"He held me against a wall, blocking me with his body. My attention was focused on the knife and all I could think of was that I was going to die. The attack was obviously premeditated and I had a sense of leaving my body. In a situation like that you can't scream and you are immobilised because your body is flooded with adrenalin.\"</p> <p>Instinct told her to keep talking to the man. He said to her: \"My name is Dave and I've never touched a woman before\" - the same eerie remark he made to other victims. A kind of surreal small talk was established between them and at last Mulcahy loosened his grip. At this point Jess tried to escape but he came after her, more aggressive than before, and dragged her along to another piece of ground before swiftly, angrily, raping her.</p> <p>Like Jess, many of the victims were dragged along the ground during the men's \"hunting\" session, in a sick parody of cavemen trapping their prey.</p> <p>\"I know feminists say rape is about power and not about sex,\" Jess says, \"but I think that's simplistic because these men objectified everything and chose their victims very carefully. And it's rubbish to say women have fantasies about rape. There was nothing erotic about that podgy, thick, dirty, beer-smelling man forcing himself on me.\"</p> <p>After going to the police, Jess decided she just had to get on with her life. \"I kept telling myself that I hadn't been murdered, I hadn't been mutilated, and I should just think of the whole thing as a one-night stand. I remember telling a friend about it soon afterwards in a very upbeat way, insisting chirpily that I wasn't going to be a victim.\"</p> <p>In terms of recovery, that was the worst possible thing to do. \"I had some very damaging therapy sessions, first with a woman who gave me internal examinations to see if I had a phobia about having things stuck up my vagina, then with a psychologist who advised me to go out and have lots of flings and take risks with sex. I now know that what I should have had was a period of bereavement, with no sex at all.\"</p> <p>Jess has discovered more helpful therapies since her initial disastrous experiences and some healing has taken place, but she still feels unable to get emotionally or physically close to a man, and even has avoidance strategies to stop herself getting too close to friends, family or colleagues. She is now a successful professional but says: \"I feel maybe I would have been more successful if it hadn't been for the rape. Somehow it has held me back from going after the things I want in my career. I'm more inclined to do what others want me to do.\"</p> <p>It is almost as if her innermost energy is being perpetually sapped by the attack. \"If a friend phones me, I don't always return the call. I can't manage that leap of energy to make a connection with people. If I go to a party, I'm happy to dance but I don't want to talk to people I don't know. In some way all this has affected my language, too - at times I just lose words. And if I come across someone I feel is more powerful than me, I can't bear to be in the same room as them.\"</p> <p>Her outwardly confident, cheerful persona belies the inner desolation. \"For a while I had terrible dreams about half-dead, rotting animals. A friend of mine who had also been raped [by another man] had almost identical dreams.\"</p> <p>But Jess doesn't want revenge on the man who raped her. \"I feel grief rather than anger, grief for the loss of my own life, for the loss of the other victims' lives and for the outcome for the rapists. What a mess for all of us who have lost our lives.</p> <p>\"Even in the beginning I didn't really feel anger because I could see that this man was in a disturbed state. I have wept a lot, but particularly hearing the details of deaths and mutilations in the trial, the whole thing feels almost beyond anger. Being raped means the end of your life as you knew it before. From that moment on, things are radically different and part of that is about a lost innocence. I think that's a feeling all women who have been raped share.\"</p> <p>She has applied to interview Duffy and Mulcahy in jail; she wants to hear them talk about the rapes and the murders to make them real. \"I need to have that sense that these events really happened, rather than having them just a suppressed memory. Watching Duffy give evidence and confess to everything in court, I believe he really has changed. He seems to be utterly truthful and no longer has anything to lose.\"</p> <p>At one point, Jess's job took her inside a category A jail to work with violent offenders, including rapists. \"I stood up in front of them and said: 'I'm a rape victim and I believe in forgiveness.' One of the men stood up and said: 'I want to say that I know I did wrong and I am sorry, I regret it and I hope I never do wrong again.' One by one, all the other men stood up, too, in a strange kind of solidarity. The feeling was incredible. All of them were able to be honest about themselves in a way you only can when you have gone beyond ego. These men need to be taken out of circulation but a therapeutic environment is what they need to heal so that we, their victims, can heal too.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>In Tom Stoppard's play, Artist Descending A Staircase, a sculptor agonises about how to justify a career as an artist when there are millions starving around the world. He eventually solves this moral quandary by creating edible art. </p> <p>The chief executive of Channel 4, Michael Jackson, faces a similar dilemma. How does he balance the stuff the network was set up to do - such as ethnic programmes - with the kind of thing that brings the ratings in - documentaries about sex? This tension between the sleazy and the serious has increased since Channel 4 was required to sell its own advertising, necessarily becoming more commercial. This week, Jackson comes up with the perfect solution, as elegant in its way as culinary sculptures: a documentary series about ethnic sex. </p> <p>Position Impossible (Wednesday, 9pm, Channel 4) is a three-part documentary about the Kama Sutra. The series is a perfect example of Channel 4 in the position it now adopts to give pleasure: The Clown Who Swallowed A Thinker. On Jeremy Isaacs's Channel 4, this series would have been called The Pleasures Of The Gods, a buy-in from Indian TV, hosted by an unknown Asian sexologist.

      "bodyText": "In Tom Stoppard's play, Artist Descending A Staircase, a sculptor agonises about how to justify a career as an artist when there are millions starving around the world. He eventually solves this moral quandary by creating edible art. The chief executive of Channel 4, Michael Jackson, faces a similar dilemma. How does he balance the stuff the network was set up to do - such as ethnic programmes - with the kind of thing that brings the ratings in - documentaries about sex? This tension between the sleazy and the serious has increased since Channel 4 was required to sell its own advertising, necessarily becoming more commercial. This week, Jackson comes up with the perfect solution, as elegant in its way as culinary sculptures: a documentary series about ethnic sex. Position Impossible (Wednesday, 9pm, Channel 4) is a three-part documentary about the Kama Sutra. The series is a perfect example of Channel 4 in the position it now adopts to give pleasure: The Clown Who Swallowed A Thinker. On Jeremy Isaacs's Channel 4, this series would have been called The Pleasures Of The Gods, a buy-in from Indian TV, hosted by an unknown Asian sexologist. On Michael Grade's Channel 4, it would have been called The Kama Sutra, presented by Dr Raj Persaud, and the Daily Mail would have called for the series to be banned. On Michael Jackson's Channel 4, its name plays with the title of a Tom Cruise movie, the frontman is the comedian Sanjeev Bhaskar from Goodness Gracious Me, and the Daily Mail last week called Channel 4 the \"station of the thinking middle-classes\".

But their experience of a dangerous workplace is part of a much bigger picture, with secretaries and receptionists particularly at risk. </p> <p>\"My two fellow receptionists and I are increasingly on the receiving end of swearing, spitting and threats. Once, we even had a toilet and basin hurled across the room by a family who were fed up of not being given a new one,\" says 35-year-old Emma, who works for the housing department of a local council. She has become so used to such scenes that she accepts it as \"part of the job\". </p> <p>\"As receptionists, we are not only the first point of contact for clients, but in their eyes, we represent our employer,\" she explains. \"So if they're feeling angry or aggressive at the council, it's us they tend to pick on. Sometimes, their aggression has been brewing for months and the moment we ask, 'How can I help you?' it all floods out.\" </p> <p>According to the TUC report Violent Times, one in five workers is subjected to such violent attacks and verbal abuse every year. Meanwhile, the latest British Crime Survey reports 1.2m incidents of work-related violence annually. \"Just as the most common victims include support staff - rather than those working with obviously dangerous people - the most common work environments in which assaults happen aren't obviously dangerous either. Schools, libraries and councils have all become higher risk areas than ever before,\" says Sarah Simpson, training director for the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, the charity for personal safety, named after the young estate agent who disappeared without a trace in the course of her work. </p> <p>\"Statistics show that public-sector workers are most at risk, since they offer aid to people under particular emotional strain,\" says Tom Mellish of the TUC. But incidents of workplace violence are also occurring more frequently in the private sector - especially in those companies that offer a service. </p> <p>Consider Susan Fox, a 25-year-old PA at an insurance firm. She was threatened by a client who refused to wait until the managing director had finished his telephone call. \"He shouted at me, came very close to me and made signals with his hands as if he wanted to strangle me. It was terrifying. Thankfully, a colleague heard and came in, at which point the client stopped. But it took me several weeks to completely calm down from the incident.\" </p> <p>The Health and Safety Commission (HSC), which has launched a new initiative to tackle the problem, defines workplace violence as any incident in which someone is assaulted, threatened or verbally abused in circumstances relating to their work. \"Some people assume an incident only counts as violence at work if they wind up in hospital or at least black and blue. In reality, it encompasses a whole range of abuse, none of which is acceptable,\" explains a spokesperson. \"This misunderstanding is one of the reasons we have started a three-year programme to raise awareness of the prevalence of workplace violence.\" </p> <p>The millennial attitude of the \"customer as king\" is one of the reasons for the increase in incidents, according to Simpson. \"The Customer's Charter, the Traveller's Charter, the Patient's Charter are all initiatives that make the public want a result and want it now. When that doesn't happen, they feel they have a right to become hostile,\" she explains. In addition, she believes life is more stressful. \"Even getting to an office can be annoying. My journey in this morning involved late trains and battling through crowds. If you've already got an axe to grind at your destination, and then you have to face that kind of trip to get there, it can cause aggression.\" </p> <p>The growth of office burglaries in broad daylight is also significant. With cutting-edge computer equipment becoming a regular feature of today's workplace, there's more to steal than there was a decade or two ago. Burglars pose as clients, enter the office and grab what they can. If you, as a receptionist, follow your instinct to try to stop them when you realise what's happening, you may find yourself on the receiving end of violence. </p> <p>It doesn't help that many managers aren't even aware of their responsibilities. There are five pieces of legislation relevant to violence at work, including the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 which stipulates that managers have a duty to protect staff from danger \"as far as is reasonably practicable\". </p> <p>\"But many employers think health and safety has nothing to do with personal safety. A lot don't react until something terrible happens,\" says Simpson. </p> <p>Tunbridge Wells borough council is a case in point. It wasn't until an incident in 1997 that it developed a detailed policy covering definitions of violence, security measures, the council's legal obligations, reporting procedures and support systems. \"A member of the public entered the finance office, picked up the VDU screen and threw it across the room. No one was hurt, but it made us realise how inadequate our procedures were,\" explains a spokesperson. </p> <p>In fact, the council had already installed panic buttons, but the victim had felt too scared to use it - something that the Suzy Lamplugh Trust claims is all too common. \"If a secretary is not familiar with using it, it's not second nature. And in order to be an effective security measure, it must be second nature,\" says Simpson. A further problem is that if the panic button makes a noise, it can exacerbate the perpetrators' aggression. Likewise, if it doesn't make a sound, the victim can't be sure if it has worked. The solution, managers are increasingly realising, is a button that lights up when activated. </p> <p>Other proactive measures that employers are taking include risk assessments. Mellish explains: \"They ask what kind of incidents cause violence at work. Is the layout putting people at extra risk - for instance, by leaving receptionists working in a public area alone? If clients face lengthy waits, could the waiting area be made more comfortable? Is there a common element in the circumstances that give rise to violence and could that element be acted on? Is there a policy in place that encourages staff to report incidents of violence, so that security measures can be constantly evaluated?\" </p> <p>Particularly forward-thinking managers offer frontline staff training in how to recognise the signs of aggression and diffuse potentially dangerous situations. The way you sit, stand and relate to a person can, for instance, have an effect. Hands on the hips or fidgeting hands can be seen as confrontational - as can too much eye contact or moving closer to the person even if it's to put a hand on them in an attempt to calm them down. Staff are also taught that they have a right to walk away. At London Underground, frontline employees put up posters with the message, \"Work without fear: Our staff are entitled to work without fear or intimidation.\" </p> <p>But the reality remains that even the most sophisticated security policies and procedures for safety cannot guarantee that a violent incident will never occur. This, according to counsellor Thelma Williams, is why after-care - such as debriefing and trauma counselling - is as important as training. \"Depression, fear, head-aches and flashbacks are typical responses to traumatic experiences. Very often, these responses resolve themselves in a few days, but when sufferers fail to acknowledge their emotions about the event, they can be heightened or prolonged. They may even lead to post-traumatic stress disorder,\" she says. </p> <p>The solution is clear: a holistic way of managing violence in which all the company is involved. The alternative is potentially horrendous, as Nicola Fawssett's experience reveals. A 29-year-old receptionist at a local alcohol supplier, she was threatened at knifepoint four years ago. There had been few security measures in place and the only follow-up from her employer was a bouquet of flowers sent to her house. It was a further two years before she felt able to return to work. </p> <p><strong> Play it safe - stick to these rules </strong><br> </p> <p> 1. Be alert. Look confident and keep fit. Good posture, stamina and strength are an aid to self-protection. </p> <p>2. Be aware. Trust your intuition. If you feel scared or uneasy, do not ignore the warning. Act on it. </p> <p>3. Avoid risk. When going out from the workplace, leave written details of your movements and when you expect to be back. </p> <p>4. Walk away. It is not weak to walk away from violence. Meeting aggression with aggression usually leads to confrontation. </p> <p>5. Always report any incidents. No matter how trivial an event may seem to you, you should always report it.

But their experience of a dangerous workplace is part of a much bigger picture, with secretaries and receptionists particularly at risk. \"My two fellow receptionists and I are increasingly on the receiving end of swearing, spitting and threats. Once, we even had a toilet and basin hurled across the room by a family who were fed up of not being given a new one,\" says 35-year-old Emma, who works for the housing department of a local council. She has become so used to such scenes that she accepts it as \"part of the job\". \"As receptionists, we are not only the first point of contact for clients, but in their eyes, we represent our employer,\" she explains. \"So if they're feeling angry or aggressive at the council, it's us they tend to pick on. Sometimes, their aggression has been brewing for months and the moment we ask, 'How can I help you?' it all floods out.\" According to the TUC report Violent Times, one in five workers is subjected to such violent attacks and verbal abuse every year.

You'll need a fairly strong stomach to make it through his harrowing account of a late 19C delivery in which a despairing mother and her unborn child hover on the brink between life and death. Stick with it however, since this well-crafted adaptation of a Roald Dahl short story turns out to be a horribly thought-provoking historical snapshot. Show it to anyone you know who insists that webfilm is strictly eye-candy for anoraks, and watch their jaw drop.

One minute it's having a pop at the political process (On the Campaign Trail), the next it's casting a drag queen as Whitney Houston and singling her out as a paranoid control freak (Mama's Little Baby). Many of the films use borrowed bits of video footage (Smokeabowl for Superbowl) and few have anything like a traditional narrative. So lovers of twee shockwave animations beware: many of the films here are undeniably nasty. But they do cut deeper into the heart of US culture than anywhere else on the net.

(KS) \u0095 View the film Genesis and Catastrophe (www.ifilm.com) Jonathan Liebesman's chilling and dignified drama took Best Short at the Austin Film Festival last year, earning its director a Hollywood agent and some big-name notice. You'll need a fairly strong stomach to make it through his harrowing account of a late 19C delivery in which a despairing mother and her unborn child hover on the brink between life and death. Stick with it however, since this well-crafted adaptation of a Roald Dahl short story turns out to be a horribly thought-provoking historical snapshot. Show it to anyone you know who insists that webfilm is strictly eye-candy for anoraks, and watch their jaw drop. (KS) View the film www.craptv.com Crap TV is a small, subversive cyber cinema based in California that is quickly developing a speciality in degrading and defacing contemporary US icons. One minute it's having a pop at the political process (On the Campaign Trail), the next it's casting a drag queen as Whitney Houston and singling her out as a paranoid control freak (Mama's Little Baby). Many of the films use borrowed bits of video footage (Smokeabowl for Superbowl) and few have anything like a traditional narrative. So lovers of twee shockwave animations beware: many of the films here are undeniably nasty. But they do cut deeper into the heart of US culture than anywhere else on the net.

Le Riche, a principal dancer with Paris Opera, was last seen in London partnering Guillem in Ashton's Marguerite and Armand, his rugged dancing and dramatic impetuosity a foil to her delicate intensity. The more extended role of Romeo does, in fact, expose the ragged edges of Le Riche's technique (suprisingly ragged for a Paris-trained dancer) but it's also a lesson in how performers can often define their style out of their limitations. </p> <p>Le Riche's footwork and pirouettes are not perfectly finessed, yet as compensation he rides the swell of the music with powered assurance and his beautifully articulate arms and hands give wit to both his phrasing and his acting. In real life, his Romeo would be a man of bounding energies, a great teller of jokes and a great kisser. </p> <p>With this confidence, he matches Guillem's headstrong, free-spirited Juliet well. When we first see the latter, she's less a vulnerable child than a mischievous flirt, dancing on a bubble of laughter and impatience. Her accelerating love for Romeo is stormily physical and Le Riche's strong partnering allows the pair to take heady risks. </p> <p>What's lacking in Guillem's Juliet, though, is a sense of tragedy.

Although it fell in December, November's inflation rate of 3.2% was a strong influence on January pay budgets. The increase in pay set tlements is likely to reinforce fears among the hawks on the MPC, notably labour market expert Stephen Nickell, that low unemployment could still create a wage/price spiral, although other committee members are more concerned about the deflationary impact of weakening global growth. </p> <p>January's vote was the closest for months, with four of the nine members voting for a rate cut. Since then, underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, has fallen further below target and GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year slowed to its weakest rate for two years. </p> <p>However, the GDP figures were distorted by an erratic fall in energy output, and most short-term indicators suggest business and consumer activity remains strong despite the sharp slowdown in the US. </p> <p>A survey published yesterday suggested business leaders needed a rate cut. The BDO Business Trends report found that, although the economy remained relatively healthy, business confidence was continuing to deteriorate. </p> <p>Peter Hemington, a partner at BDO Stoy Hayward, said: \"The report shows that UK business is in danger of talking itself into a slowdown, even though the economic outlook remains reasonably positive.\"</p>",

The increase in pay set tlements is likely to reinforce fears among the hawks on the MPC, notably labour market expert Stephen Nickell, that low unemployment could still create a wage/price spiral, although other committee members are more concerned about the deflationary impact of weakening global growth. January's vote was the closest for months, with four of the nine members voting for a rate cut. Since then, underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, has fallen further below target and GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year slowed to its weakest rate for two years. However, the GDP figures were distorted by an erratic fall in energy output, and most short-term indicators suggest business and consumer activity remains strong despite the sharp slowdown in the US. A survey published yesterday suggested business leaders needed a rate cut. The BDO Business Trends report found that, although the economy remained relatively healthy, business confidence was continuing to deteriorate. Peter Hemington, a partner at BDO Stoy Hayward, said: \"The report shows that UK business is in danger of talking itself into a slowdown, even though the economic outlook remains reasonably positive.\"",

He still chooses the opera houses in which he works with care, though: last summer he conducted Janacek at Aix-en-Provence, in May he will tackle Beethoven's Fidelio at Glyndebourne, and just now he is in charge of Tristan und Isolde at the Netherlands Opera - his third show, following Pelleas et Melisande and Parsifal, at the Amsterdam Muziektheater. Though the cast and the production are serviceable enough, it is Rattle's contribution that will be the main interest of this Tristan. </p> <p>Without a resident orchestra of its own, the Netherlands Opera rotates the country's leading bands in the pit; for this show it is the Rotterdam Philharmonic, and they play for Rattle with a clarity that suits his approach very well. In an ideal world, the strings could have more body (though the Muziektheater acoustic doesn't help them) so that the longer phrases could blossom more expressively, but Rattle's concern is less with the long, ecstatic paragraphs than with the passing details of the score; he makes every bar light up with inner intensity, delivers the climaxes with crushing definition. It is not the only way to present this strange work, but it is a compellingly immediate and theatrical one. </p> <p>To some extent that theatricality is diffused by Alfred Kirchner's staging of this everyday story of Cornish folk, which is routine in most of its details and its acting. It may not be as bland as the Ring cycle he mounted for Bayreuth in the 1990s, but what glosses it does provide are mostly unremarkable. Like a schoolgirl with a crush, Isolde keeps a photograph of Tristan in her locker, which she reveals to him at the climax of the first act confrontation - a reminder, presumably, that the love potion (which, Brangaene's behaviour suggests, is administered by mistake) is only the catalyst for their passion and not the cause, while Tristan pulls himself onto Melot's sword at the end of the second. </p> <p>Annette Murschetz's sets mix cold abstraction and cosier naturalism sometimes disconcertingly - there is an ever-changing seascape projected throughout the first act, a grassy knoll and a blazing tree strewn across the stage in the second; the rest is all steely walkways and panels, tellingly lit by Jean Kalman. </p> <p>Gabriele Schnaut's improbably blonde Isolde is a good deal more animated than her semaphoric characterisation for the Royal Opera last autumn, and generally better sung, too. Instead of the armour-piercing stridency of that performance, there is much more light and shade, even some warmth too. Her partner is the British tenor John Treleaven, hardly ever heard in his homeland nowadays, but a robust and convincing Tristan here. His is not a particularly seductive sound, but it is effective and well-sustained. </p> <p>There is excellent support from Petra Lang's ever-dependable Brangaene, Robert Lloyd's rather sinister King Marke, and Alan Held's relatively understated Kurwenal. All of them are attentively nurtured by Rattle, though whether his contribution is enough to raise the show above the ordinary remains another matter. </p> <p>\u0095 Performances tonight and February 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 26.
