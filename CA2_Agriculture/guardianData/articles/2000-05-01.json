He works hard, nicks people and puts them in the dock. He likes being at the flashpoint of policing.\"</p> <p>Mr Grieve, an accountant's son born in Gosforth, Tyen and Wear, built his reputation in the drugs squad working undercover. He grew his hair and wore flares to infiltrate street gangs in the east end, securing numerous convictions. He went on to write a definitive guide to undercover work which has been adopted by other forces.</p> <p>His experiences then challenged him to \"think the unthinkable\". Speaking to the Association of Chief Police Officers several years later, he said licensing drug dealers would have to be considered. The suggestion, he admitted, was born of despair because the police were only \"sitting on the lid of the problem\".</p> <p><b> Lateral thinking</b><br></p> <p>His first high profile job came in the early 1990s when he was appointed director of SO11, Scotland Yard's criminal intelligence division. Mr Grieve seems to be at his most creative when he is thinking laterally and considering different ways of dealing with old problems. In SO11, he took risks with the use of informants to tackle Yardie-gangs and it landed him, and the division, in piping hot water.</p> <p>The division was using a registered informant and cocaine dealer, Eaton Green, a prolific source of information on the underworld in which he lived. In 1993, Green and an accomplice robbed 150 people at gunpoint at a party in Nottingham. Green shot one man in the foot and sneered at him: \"Bleed, pussy, bleed.\"</p> <p>When the pair were arrested by local officers six weeks later, SO11 did not tell them he was an informant; worse, it seemed to do everything it could to have the trial of the two men aborted. After they were convicted, Mr Grieve said he \"deeply regretted\" the whole episode, but his attitude to using high risk strategies was unchanged. Green, he said, had been \"well worth the investment. It is extremely unfortunate that we no longer have him available to us\".</p> <p>Mr Grieve believes it is \"impossible\" to tackle serious crime without the use of informants. Though controversial, his tactics seemed to work and the number of Yardie murders levelled off. He was equally successful as head of the anti-terrorist squad, SO13.</p> <p>His appointment coincided with the IRA bombing of the Docklands, a spectacular and bloody end to the ceasefire. Mr Grieve, who was apparently \"wide-eyed with astonishment\" at the devastation caused by the blast, drew on all his experience. \"John's time in the anti-terrorist branch was very significant,\" said one insider. \"The provos realised there was a whole new ball game. He didn't wait for things to happen. He went out to find them. He was proactive in a way that some of his predecessors had not been. It gave the police the initiative.\"</p> <p>When the former commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, asked him to set up the racial and violent crimes task force in September, 1998, he creamed off the best detectives to work with him. Their first case was to reinvestigate the death of the black musician, Michael Menson, who died in February 1997, after being set on fire. Initially, the police had insisted Mr Menson had committed suicide. The Met was forced to reevaluate because of determined campaigning by the Menson family, and an inquest which ruled the 30-year-old had been unlawfully killed.</p> <p>Four months after taking over the inquiry, Grieve's men had arrested three of the men responsible for killing Mr Menson, and traced another, Ozgay Cevat, to northern Cyprus. The investigation bore all the hallmarks of the anti-terrorist branch. The evidence against the men came from conversations which were picked up and recorded by a bugging device planted in one of their homes. The men had been teased into talking about the crime again by fresh appeals for witnesses, including leafleting of the area where they lived.</p> <p><b> Sophisticated unit</b><br></p> <p>It was bold stuff. The conviction of Cevat in a republic which the British government does not even recognise was particularly audacious. Mr Grieve has been able to fashion the task force; this is reflected in the people he has recruited, and the way they work.</p> <p>The unit has the most sophisticated intelligence gathering and assessment system of any department in the Met. Mr Grieve regards his team of civilian computer analysts as core members of the team. Refreshingly, he is not obsessed by rank. If he thinks a junior officer has something to contribute, he or she will be invited to speak at the top table.</p> <p>Others in the Met have found this difficult to cope with. On one occasion, a young detective sergeant was asked by Grieve to join a high ranking meeting chaired by an assistant commissioner. The older men referred to each other by their christian names. The assistant commissioner was apparently apoplectic that the whipper-snapper had the temerity to join in.</p> <p>Mr Grieve was a regular visitor to the Lawrence inquiry, both for its hearings in London and around the country. Unlike some of his more defensive and straightlaced colleagues, he went out of his way to be affable and approachable to anyone who cared to engage with him. Despite his bear-like stature, he had a slightly shambolic, bluff persona which seemed to inspire confidence.</p> <p>He was an assiduous cultivator of selected journalists, giving them the impression that he valued their views and knowledge. \"Come by and see how we really work,\" he would say, offering the sort of access that few senior detectives would contemplate. He went to the opening night of The Colour of Justice, the dramatisation of the Macpherson hearings, in January last year, and caused something of a stir by suggesting the play could have been much tougher on the Met.</p> <p>To some, his bonhommie has a touch of calculation: his handling of the new Lawrence inquiry has shown that he needs the support of the media to fly his kites. Mr Grieve has been on to something for months. Three people have been arrested and then released on bail, a knife was discovered in a back garden, and he has hinted that the alliances that once bound the original suspects are breaking down.</p> <p>Not everyone has been pleased to see his star rise. Last year, someone, possibly a Met officer, went to the trouble of sending to Stephen Lawrence's parents, Doreen and Neville, a four page document which attempted to smear him and other officers.</p> <p>It claimed, without foundation, that he had friends in the force who were known racists. It referred to a \u00a332,000 payout awarded seven years ago to Sarah Locker, a police woman who claimed she had been denied promotion because of sexual and racial discrimination. Mr Grieve had been her overall boss at Lehman Street police station in the east end and apologised to her in public on behalf of Sir Paul Condon.</p> <p>It illustrates that Grieve has made enemies. Most of his colleagues, however, treat him with reverence. Officers in the task force call him \"the boss\" and look up to him with respect and affection. \"He's like no other officer I have ever served with,\" said one. \"He doesn't think like a normal detective.\"</p> <p>There is a fear at Scotland Yard that if Mr Grieve manages to charge and convict the racist killers of Stephen Lawrence, then he might be tempted to retire to his library of crime books, his canvases and selection of Bob Dylan records. \"That's the last thing anyone wants,\" said an insider. \"He's our prime asset at the moment. No wonder they're keeping him so busy.\"</p>",

He didn't wait for things to happen. He went out to find them. He was proactive in a way that some of his predecessors had not been. It gave the police the initiative.\" When the former commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, asked him to set up the racial and violent crimes task force in September, 1998, he creamed off the best detectives to work with him. Their first case was to reinvestigate the death of the black musician, Michael Menson, who died in February 1997, after being set on fire. Initially, the police had insisted Mr Menson had committed suicide. The Met was forced to reevaluate because of determined campaigning by the Menson family, and an inquest which ruled the 30-year-old had been unlawfully killed. Four months after taking over the inquiry, Grieve's men had arrested three of the men responsible for killing Mr Menson, and traced another, Ozgay Cevat, to northern Cyprus. The investigation bore all the hallmarks of the anti-terrorist branch. The evidence against the men came from conversations which were picked up and recorded by a bugging device planted in one of their homes. The men had been teased into talking about the crime again by fresh appeals for witnesses, including leafleting of the area where they lived. Sophisticated unit It was bold stuff. The conviction of Cevat in a republic which the British government does not even recognise was particularly audacious. Mr Grieve has been able to fashion the task force; this is reflected in the people he has recruited, and the way they work. The unit has the most sophisticated intelligence gathering and assessment system of any department in the Met. Mr Grieve regards his team of civilian computer analysts as core members of the team. Refreshingly, he is not obsessed by rank. If he thinks a junior officer has something to contribute, he or she will be invited to speak at the top table. Others in the Met have found this difficult to cope with. On one occasion, a young detective sergeant was asked by Grieve to join a high ranking meeting chaired by an assistant commissioner. The older men referred to each other by their christian names. The assistant commissioner was apparently apoplectic that the whipper-snapper had the temerity to join in. Mr Grieve was a regular visitor to the Lawrence inquiry, both for its hearings in London and around the country. Unlike some of his more defensive and straightlaced colleagues, he went out of his way to be affable and approachable to anyone who cared to engage with him. Despite his bear-like stature, he had a slightly shambolic, bluff persona which seemed to inspire confidence. He was an assiduous cultivator of selected journalists, giving them the impression that he valued their views and knowledge. \"Come by and see how we really work,\" he would say, offering the sort of access that few senior detectives would contemplate. He went to the opening night of The Colour of Justice, the dramatisation of the Macpherson hearings, in January last year, and caused something of a stir by suggesting the play could have been much tougher on the Met. To some, his bonhommie has a touch of calculation: his handling of the new Lawrence inquiry has shown that he needs the support of the media to fly his kites. Mr Grieve has been on to something for months. Three people have been arrested and then released on bail, a knife was discovered in a back garden, and he has hinted that the alliances that once bound the original suspects are breaking down. Not everyone has been pleased to see his star rise. Last year, someone, possibly a Met officer, went to the trouble of sending to Stephen Lawrence's parents, Doreen and Neville, a four page document which attempted to smear him and other officers. It claimed, without foundation, that he had friends in the force who were known racists. It referred to a \u00a332,000 payout awarded seven years ago to Sarah Locker, a police woman who claimed she had been denied promotion because of sexual and racial discrimination. Mr Grieve had been her overall boss at Lehman Street police station in the east end and apologised to her in public on behalf of Sir Paul Condon. It illustrates that Grieve has made enemies. Most of his colleagues, however, treat him with reverence. Officers in the task force call him \"the boss\" and look up to him with respect and affection. \"He's like no other officer I have ever served with,\" said one. \"He doesn't think like a normal detective.\" There is a fear at Scotland Yard that if Mr Grieve manages to charge and convict the racist killers of Stephen Lawrence, then he might be tempted to retire to his library of crime books, his canvases and selection of Bob Dylan records. \"That's the last thing anyone wants,\" said an insider. \"He's our prime asset at the moment. No wonder they're keeping him so busy.\"",

There have been poor and rich countries since countries began, but only controls on movement (and what goes with them, passports) this century. Why did not all the poor swamp the rich countries then?</p> <p>It is not the poor who move, not those from either the poorest countries or the poorest areas in the countries where immigrants come from. The overwhelming majority stay at home. Even those who think about it are deterred by the costs - especially of moving to the notoriously dangerous, inhospitable and racist conditions of Europe. It is only the foolish vanity of Europeans which makes them think everyone wants to get in.</p> <p>Blaming poverty is a cop-out to hide the real reason for migration. Europe and North America need the workers. Even when unemployment is high, there are areas of great shortages of workers. Anyone who has had the misfortune to work in McDonald's, flipping hamburgers, as a dishwasher in a hotel, or gutting chickens in rural factories, knows the desperate scarcity of workers in jobs where the pay and conditions are rotten.</p> <p>In general, immigrants don't do the jobs the natives want (except if they're students on their uppers), so they don't displace native workers nor drive down wages. In fact, the situation is the opposite. If a hospital cannot recruit enough workers to do the unskilled jobs - porters, cleaners, laundry and canteen workers, security guards - it is impossible for the nurses, doctors, managers to work. So if you cut the number of immigrant workers, you increase native unemployment.</p> <p>Indeed, an increase in the numbers of workers usually expands the economy and so increases the jobs available for native workers. A study of the Los Angeles garment industry showed that the availability of Mexican illegal immigrants made possible the survival of the industry - and so the survival of jobs for Americans as technicians, foremen, managers, salespeople, truckers, shop assistants, not to mention all those others who provided the immigrants with food, accommodation, transport, etc. That is why a million Cubans lifted the economy of Miami out of slump, and a million French colonists returning from Algeria (at independence) lifted the south of France.</p> <p>The extreme rightwing argument - kick the immigrants out and unemployment will be ended - is not only nonsense, it is the opposite of what would happen. Expel the immigrants and native unemployment would soar. In the postwar baby boom, when the children became adults and looked for work, there was no increase in unemployment. Think of the immense increase in the number of women looking for work in the 1960s and 1970s, far more than the number of immigrants: they did not cause unemployment. It is not the size of the labour force that determines unemployment but the profits of business. People only object to immigrants not because they are workers, but because they are foreigners.</p> <p>Furthermore, controls are expensive and ineffective. Hunting illegals inflicts yet further savageries on immigrants, and now on refugees (who are also forbidden to work while waiting a decision on their refugee status, and thus reduced to dependence on government handouts). Indeed, ending controls would go some way to radically reducing unemployment - as happened in the great boom years of the 1950s and 1960s when unemployment was at a low and immigration not limited.</p> <p>So why are there controls? The issue is not about jobs but about sovereignty, the power of the state. That is embedded in the perceptions of the citizens. The population is drilled from an early age in xenophobia, socialised in a culture of hating foreigners and blaming them for whatever goes wrong (and look how it flourishes in international football, or in the beef trade ) .</p> <p>It is also barely concealed racism. Foreigners don't arrive by plane or train, they \"invade\", \"swamp\", \"flood\", \"pour in\", \"take over\" - they are soldiers of an enemy onslaught. So increased numbers of immigrants supposedly weaken the foundation of loyalty to the state, muddying it with loyalty to other states.</p> <p>In practice, governments are ambivalent. In a global economy, they are obliged to acknowledge that jobs and incomes depend on increased movement of workers, immigration and emigration - the global labour market. Yet, they fear this undermines what it is to be \"British\" or \"French\" or whatever. The compromise is to define many exceptions for selected workers - doctors, nurses, businessmen, employees of multinational corporations or international organisations, seasonal agricultural labour, sometimes hotel workers and domestics, while reserving the full ferocity of persecution to those at the bottom of the pile, the illegal immigrants and refugees.</p> <p>It cannot last forever. The pressures of worker movement are too strong - the system cannot control the world labour market, only drive it into the miseries of illegality. Furthermore, ageing is undermining it. As the numbers of aged increase, the active labour force is set to shrink - and wages, as a result, to soar. The aged need more and more labour intensive services, the caring professions, just when the number of workers is shrinking.</p> <p>Already, the developed countries are beginning to reshape immigration policy in order to recruit the workers they need. The US is currently offering computer programmers and engineers work permits, and Germany is doing the same. But if the misery of the aged is to be tackled, this will have to be vastly expanded to lesser skills.</p> <p>Increased migration is actually an immense opportunity to advance the world. Labour migration generates strong reverse flows of income - workers send money home to their families. The UN has done some calculations on how much immigration controls in the developed countries cost the third world. If they were ended, there could be a massive flow of income from the earnings of migrant workers back to developing countries, far more than current flows of aid or private capital. At last there would be a serious possibility of a real attack on world poverty.</p> <p>And would it lead to the decline of the national state? Let's hope so - their highest 20th-century triumphs were two world wars of unprecedented destruction. Then we can amend the UN Declaration of Human Rights which boldly promises the right to emigrate - but is silent on the right to immigration. The underlying principle, universal in most places up to the last century, needs to be restored - that people have the right to travel where they will, to settle and to work, as they wish. The world belongs to us all.</p> <p>Extracted from the current issue of Red Pepper.

A study of the Los Angeles garment industry showed that the availability of Mexican illegal immigrants made possible the survival of the industry - and so the survival of jobs for Americans as technicians, foremen, managers, salespeople, truckers, shop assistants, not to mention all those others who provided the immigrants with food, accommodation, transport, etc. That is why a million Cubans lifted the economy of Miami out of slump, and a million French colonists returning from Algeria (at independence) lifted the south of France. The extreme rightwing argument - kick the immigrants out and unemployment will be ended - is not only nonsense, it is the opposite of what would happen. Expel the immigrants and native unemployment would soar. In the postwar baby boom, when the children became adults and looked for work, there was no increase in unemployment. Think of the immense increase in the number of women looking for work in the 1960s and 1970s, far more than the number of immigrants: they did not cause unemployment. It is not the size of the labour force that determines unemployment but the profits of business. People only object to immigrants not because they are workers, but because they are foreigners. Furthermore, controls are expensive and ineffective. Hunting illegals inflicts yet further savageries on immigrants, and now on refugees (who are also forbidden to work while waiting a decision on their refugee status, and thus reduced to dependence on government handouts). Indeed, ending controls would go some way to radically reducing unemployment - as happened in the great boom years of the 1950s and 1960s when unemployment was at a low and immigration not limited. So why are there controls? The issue is not about jobs but about sovereignty, the power of the state. That is embedded in the perceptions of the citizens. The population is drilled from an early age in xenophobia, socialised in a culture of hating foreigners and blaming them for whatever goes wrong (and look how it flourishes in international football, or in the beef trade ) . It is also barely concealed racism. Foreigners don't arrive by plane or train, they \"invade\", \"swamp\", \"flood\", \"pour in\", \"take over\" - they are soldiers of an enemy onslaught. So increased numbers of immigrants supposedly weaken the foundation of loyalty to the state, muddying it with loyalty to other states. In practice, governments are ambivalent. In a global economy, they are obliged to acknowledge that jobs and incomes depend on increased movement of workers, immigration and emigration - the global labour market. Yet, they fear this undermines what it is to be \"British\" or \"French\" or whatever. The compromise is to define many exceptions for selected workers - doctors, nurses, businessmen, employees of multinational corporations or international organisations, seasonal agricultural labour, sometimes hotel workers and domestics, while reserving the full ferocity of persecution to those at the bottom of the pile, the illegal immigrants and refugees. It cannot last forever. The pressures of worker movement are too strong - the system cannot control the world labour market, only drive it into the miseries of illegality. Furthermore, ageing is undermining it. As the numbers of aged increase, the active labour force is set to shrink - and wages, as a result, to soar. The aged need more and more labour intensive services, the caring professions, just when the number of workers is shrinking. Already, the developed countries are beginning to reshape immigration policy in order to recruit the workers they need. The US is currently offering computer programmers and engineers work permits, and Germany is doing the same. But if the misery of the aged is to be tackled, this will have to be vastly expanded to lesser skills. Increased migration is actually an immense opportunity to advance the world. Labour migration generates strong reverse flows of income - workers send money home to their families. The UN has done some calculations on how much immigration controls in the developed countries cost the third world. If they were ended, there could be a massive flow of income from the earnings of migrant workers back to developing countries, far more than current flows of aid or private capital. At last there would be a serious possibility of a real attack on world poverty. And would it lead to the decline of the national state? Let's hope so - their highest 20th-century triumphs were two world wars of unprecedented destruction. Then we can amend the UN Declaration of Human Rights which boldly promises the right to emigrate - but is silent on the right to immigration. The underlying principle, universal in most places up to the last century, needs to be restored - that people have the right to travel where they will, to settle and to work, as they wish. The world belongs to us all. Extracted from the current issue of Red Pepper.

      "bodyText": "The health secretary, Alan Milburn, will insist that private nursing homes do far more than they now do to help elderly patients get better before he allows NHS managers to use the private sector to ease the hospital beds crisis. Mr Milburn's deputy, John Denham, yesterday confirmed that one of the action teams set up after Tony Blair's NHS modernisation initiative is considering partnership with the private sector as one means of easing the so-called \"bed-blocking\" problem. It would be daft not to, said Mr Denham. \"You have got a lot of patients, particularly elderly patients, in hospitals who don't need to be there but can't yet go home, they need rehabilitation. \"There are a lot of ideas being put forward for expanding the number of so-called intermediate care beds,\" he told Radio 4's Today. But as Labour MPs voiced their concern, health officials later made clear that other options exist. They include special wards for elderly people on the mend which could be set up within mainstream hospitals, local community hospitals or in new facilities. Before Mr Milburn sanctions NHS funds going to private nursing or residential homes he will also expect them to replace what one official called \"the missing component of care\" - the hands-on work needed to get an elderly patient back at home after a stay of up to three months. The Tories welcomed the move as a sign of belated ministerial pragmatism towards the private sector, though Mr Milburn and Mr Blair have always distinguished between using private facilities and the Tory preference for extending private health care finance - via insurance. Age Concern and the Liberal Democrats also gave a cautious welcome. But David Hinchcliffe, Labour chairman of the Commons health select committee, spoke for many Labour MPs who will be wary of such a shift in case it weakens the NHS. \"I don't see the way forward as using the nursing home sector because that sector is, frankly, not geared to the rehabilitation process that these patients will require,\" said Mr Hinchliffe, a former social worker who has long argued for integration on health and social services in critical fields like care of the elderly. \"Most of these people will be returning to their own homes and the private care sector has, quite frankly, a record of encouraging dependence rather than independence. \"So I would be very worried if a role was being envisaged for them,\" he told the BBC's World at One He complained: \"In many instances their record is one of encouraging dependence because it is in their interests to do that - they then get the business to fill their own beds.\" Bed-blocking, whereby elderly patients stay in hospital because they are not well enough to look after themselves at home, is a long-standing but growing problem for the NHS which gets most of its patients in and out of hospital in ever-shorter times - and has fewer beds as a result. Most emergency admissions to hospital are among the over-75s. Ministers are keen to woo older voters - not least because they are so numerous. The partnership action team, chaired by John Hutton, junior health minister, also includes Dr Ian Bogle, BMA chairman, Christine Hancock, general secretary of the Royal College of Nurses, whose members bear the brunt of such work, and Andrew Foster, head of the audit commission. Gordon Brown is stumping up a record 6.3% increase in NHS spending, but Mr Blair wants better value for money. The Conservatives' health spokesman, Dr Liam Fox, accused the government of sending out mixed signals to the private sector.",

The tourists had just finished dinner on the Sipadan Island diving resort in Malaysia on April 23 when they were kidnapped. They were taken with other hostages on a 22-hour boat ride to Jolo, the largest of the Sulu group of islands. The kidnappers procured T-shirts, shorts and trousers for the hostages in Jolo town because many of them were wearing only swimming costumes when kidnapped. A couple of the women broke down while speaking of their ordeal. \"I miss my son. I miss my son,\" said Renate Juta, from Germany. Marie Michel, a Lebanese, said she \"will never go to another Asian place starting from now\". She added: \"It's getting very, very hard, nothing happens, they don't want to take any decision. \"We don't have enough food, we don't have anything to drink, we don't have anything, but I want to tell my parents in Lebanon that I am OK.\" But most of the hostages exuded a resigned calm and said they were coping with the situation. \"I'm feeling okay. I'm losing weight,\" said Monique Strydom, of South Africa. \"It's not as bad as it looks. I think [the guerrillas] are doing the best they can under the circumstances.\" Her husband, Carel, said he wanted his family back home to know that they were basically all right but getting weaker. \"It's very hot and treatment is not very good. In terms of food, it's very basic and therefore I think we're getting a little bit weaker as time goes by.\" Commander Radhulan, a spokesman for the Abu Sayyaf, said the main demand of the group was to negotiate with a representative of the UN. He did not make any threats against the hostages. Meanwhile, Philippine troops yesterday continued to search a maze of second world war tunnels in a hilltop rebel hideout where a further 27 hostages, most of them children, have been held by the same group of Islamic guerrillas for over a month. Troops launched the search after taking control of the hideout on Basilan island in the southern Philippines on Sunday in fierce hand-to-hand fighting.

The idea, says Patrick Buckley, the academy's executive director, is \"to rescue Casement from being a peripheral figure\". Most historians now believe the \"black diaries\" were genuine, though documents released at the public record office make it clear that Whitehall and the security services used them to foil a campaign to save his life. One of those who believes they were forged is Angus Mitchell, who has been awarded an Irish peace and reconciliation fund grant to complete his research. Mr Mitchell, who is pressing for an independent forensic examination of the diaries, believes they could have been forged by Admiral Reginald \"Blinker\" Hall, the head of naval intelligence. The admiral was later instrumental in leaking the forged Zinoviev letter to help bring down the Labour government in 1924. Hall was one of those who circulated the Casement diaries. Though security sources in sist there are no more hidden documents relating to the diaries,13 pages of MI5 files released last year on the Casement case were withheld. Born into the Irish Protestant ascendancy, Casement was a British consul in Africa and South America knighted for his work in exposing the exploitation and slaughter of Africans and South American Indians. He was arrested on a beach in Co Kerry, three days before the 1916 Easter rising, after landing in a boat which had picked him up from a German submarine. A trawler accompanying the submarine and carrying 20,000 guns was scuttled after being intercepted. Documents released at the public record office in 1998 show that Casement knew the Easter rising was doomed to failure after Germany reneged on its promises to send troops to help the rebels. Casement told his MI5 interrogators he had been let down by Germany but unless he accepted what he called its \"wholly futile scheme\" - the supply of a limited amount of weapons - he would be \"branded by his friends in Ireland and America as a coward and traitor to their cause\". \"I have done nothing dishonourable, as you will one day learn ...

According to the documents, Casement told Thomson that \"when he knew the Germans had refused to send men, he felt it his duty to come and warn the rebels a rising would be hopeless\". Whitehall was deeply concerned about a campaign for clemency by prominent figures, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, George Bernard Shaw, Joseph Conrad and TE Lawrence.

There are many places where I know that my partner (and our young son) would appreciate the architecture, the cultural attractions, the food, the hill walking, the beaches, but where I dare not suggest we travel because of the racism - if it is only the persistent, and clearly hostile, stares - that we are certain to encounter. The local CREs in Devon and Cornwall once entitled a report on racism in their region Keep Them In Birmingham. This attitude is shared across most of Europe's tourist areas and indicates how far we still have to go before we can talk of a genuinely tolerant society.</p> <p><b>Richard Kirkwood </b><br> University of North London <br> r.kirkwood@unl.ac.uk</p> <p>\u0095 I fear Helen Kolawole's article might dissuade some black Britons from sampling the pleasures of foreign travel.

While there are often problems on entry to certain countries, a rapid exit can be guaranteed. Passports never get lost because they're constantly in demand. Privacy in expensive restaurants can be counted on and tipping waiters for service is completely unnecessary. Souvenir shopping is always a pleasure with accompanying shop assistants on hand to assist.

      "bodyText": "The problem with Helen Kolawole's \"honest guide for black travellers\" (See the world, be insulted, G2, April 27) is that the overwhelming majority of easily and cheaply accessible destinations would receive a rating ranging from \"pretty bad\" to \"absolutely intolerable\". Sadly this includes Britain as well as continental Europe. As a white man I have learned almost as much about the day-to-day impact of racism from the tension of holidays with my black partner as I have from nearly 40 years of political campaigning and academic study. I have travelled widely in Britain and southern Europe. There are many places where I know that my partner (and our young son) would appreciate the architecture, the cultural attractions, the food, the hill walking, the beaches, but where I dare not suggest we travel because of the racism - if it is only the persistent, and clearly hostile, stares - that we are certain to encounter. The local CREs in Devon and Cornwall once entitled a report on racism in their region Keep Them In Birmingham. This attitude is shared across most of Europe's tourist areas and indicates how far we still have to go before we can talk of a genuinely tolerant society. Richard Kirkwood University of North London r.kirkwood@unl.ac.uk \u0095 I fear Helen Kolawole's article might dissuade some black Britons from sampling the pleasures of foreign travel. I'd like to point out some of the positive benefits. When confronted with badly behaved arrogant British tourists, natives are quick to absolve the black Briton of associated guilt since we're not really British anyway. While there are often problems on entry to certain countries, a rapid exit can be guaranteed. Passports never get lost because they're constantly in demand. Privacy in expensive restaurants can be counted on and tipping waiters for service is completely unnecessary. Souvenir shopping is always a pleasure with accompanying shop assistants on hand to assist. Finally, on return, luggage is thoroughly searched, ensuring all foreign currency can be conveniently retrieved and changed into sterling prior to leaving the airport. Joanna Traynor Plymouth",

      "body": "<p>LS Lowry told people they were nothing, and they loved him for it. He painted an industrial world in which people have been so dehumanised by the big black factories that they walk around like automatons. Yet Lowry was a popular hero who, when he died in 1977, was the most famous painter in Britain. He spent his life roaming around Salford and Manchester in his trademark trenchcoat and flat cap, said dour things about art and life and was despised by critics, though he had a champion in John Berger, who saw him as a social realist. Now he has the Lowry, a glittering new arts centre and gallery that houses the city of Salford's collection of his work. </p> <p>The Lowry is a happy place. This people's palace is all vertiginous views, funky bars, a purple-walled theatre and paintings of stunted millworkers, cripples, disasters and belching smoke stacks. It is extraordinary to see Lowry's paintings here, juxtaposed with the view across the landscape he once painted; to look from a painted panorama of chimneys to the vista of Salford Quays today, surrounded by executive homes, with not a single pall of smoke in sight. </p> <p>Lowry began painting before the first world war, in time off from his job as a rent collector. His famous style was developed by 1930. It was in post-war Britain, in the 60s and 70s, that he became a plain-speaking northern superstar. In the early 70s his paintings were the kind of thing everyone bought as an Athena poster. Yet since then he has more or less vanished from our national consciousness. There has been such a change in Britain since then. The mills started to vanish long before his death but in the 70s people still believed in the working class and industry and society. Lowry's paintings fetch huge prices, he has a work in Tate Britain, but you could hardly call him a popular icon. The centre has a hard task on its hands to fulfil its lottery brief by reassessing and preserving the heritage of LS Lowry. </p> <p>So it is understandable that the curators should try to turn him into a \"proper\" artist whose legacy is more complex than we imagine. Lowry's People, the opening show at the centre, which bulks out Salford's paintings with borrowed works, attempts to show that it wasn't all matchstick men. </p> <p>The exhibition is revealing, but not in the way it intends. It does not prove its case that there was more to Lowry than mills and stick figures, something it attempts by juxtaposing the famous cityscapes of the 30s and 40s with the more intimate small groups and portraits he did at the height of his fame but didn't show. Many of these were found in his house after his death, along with a bedroom entirely decorated with Rossettis. Lowry's late portraits are very bad. They lack any sense of idiosyncrasy or attention to the person painted; they have big, mad, staring eyes, are grotesque, sentimental. They belong to the world of kitsch - which is where critics always wanted to dump Lowry. </p> <p>What these portraits give you is a glimpse of Lowry's psychic state, and it's not a pretty sight. His 1938 Head of a Man with Red Eyes is a self- portrait of someone slipping into despair and madness. Lowry's People reveals the opposite of what it intends, a sad inability or unwillingness to engage with others. </p> <p>Lowry was a deeply shy, inept young man whose parents - people with middle-class aspirations who before the first world war were forced to move down in the world to industrial Pendlebury, near Salford - appear to have despised him. He said he was sent to art school because he was thought good for nothing else. Contemporaries there described him as \"asexual\". In the late 30s and 40s he shared a house with his dying mother and then lived alone. He never had an adult relationship, though when he died his executors found pornographic artworks by him. What did grip Lowry was the industrial landscape in which he grew up. </p> <p>The Lowry paintings worth looking at are the ones everyone knows. There's no point trying to turn him into a well-rounded artist because he wasn't one. He was a melancholy compulsive who painted the industrial north of England through deeply disturbed eyes, and caught aspects of it no one else was prepared to look at. It is easy today to sneer at matchstick men but no one can ignore the real authority of a painting like Coming From the Mill (1930). It's a terrifying vision. The lowering buildings are so much more real than the people. Windows repeat themselves in a thudding, monotonous rhythm that is continued by the people trudging along. This is not an angry painting; it is numb. Lowry has internalised what he feels is the city's spiritual death. </p> <p>Lowry painted the social world of Salford and Pendlebury systematically, illustrating how the factories produced people deprived of identity. His most disturbing images of the working-class crowd depict moments of supposed freedom and leisure: a drawing from 1925 of the bandstand in Peel Park shows people gathering like maggots around a piece of food, while above them the chimneys tower. Again and again he paints the crowd's attempts at leisure as feeble reproductions of the discipline of the factory. Going to the Match (1953) makes supporting the local football team seem a desperate ritual. One of his scathing images of a crowd trying to forget the factory is called Britain at Play (1943). </p> <p>Now Britain is at play. The factories have gone, the leisure industry is all. The constrained world of Lowry's north seems to be ancient history. The Lowry is a post-industrial building that comes with its own in-built memorial to the industrial age: its collection of paintings by this massively flawed, weirdly imaginative artist. </p> <p>\u0095 Lowry's People is at the Lowry, Manchester (0161-876 2020), till September 4.</p>",

      "body": "<b> Week 22 </b> <br> 'What is it?\" I am asked, often by total strangers, as they examine my just-about-discernible bump. It's a disconcerting query. It took me a while, in fact, to realise they don't mean \"Fibroid or alien?\" but \"Boy or girl?\" I am commonly supposed to know, especially now I've had a scan. Not knowing, in fact, is often considered deliberately perverse. \"Did you ask them not to tell you?\" they enquire, tenderly, as if I were keeping the knowledge for a special treat, or preserving my faith in Santa. <p>I didn't. Honestly. My hospital doesn't tell you the embryo's sex on principle and I was too busy worrying about whether Baby had a brain to push an enquiry. And it seemed irrelevant anyway: Baby certainly didn't look gendered on his/her ultrasound image, in the same way that s/he didn't look young or sweet - just distantly human. </p> <p>I think of tiny babies as being only distantly gendered, too, and the tutus and machine guns as emerging later, as part of a toddler's identity. But I seem to be behind the times. We may be in the era of equal education, fashionable androgyny and universal combat trousers from Gap, but little babies seem more strongly gendered than ever - or their consumer goods are. Most clothes for newborns are divided by sex: sugar pink frocks for girls, blue sailor babygros for boys. Even innocuous items such as pyjamas and nursery friezes are gendered according to the skirts or trousers of the cavorting teddies that adorn them. We seem to be going backwards: until the 19th century, all children wore the same long clothes and curls till they were five or six. Maybe they were more secure in their gender identity then. And when did teddies fall from grace and start covering their parts? I'm sure my teddy was nude, neuter and unashamed. </p> <p>Some gender assumptions, of course, aren't modern at all. \"It's a boy,\" proclaimed a woman in the butcher's, eyeing my bag of steak (full: my blood fixation continues). Then, seeing I was taken aback: \"Isn't that what you want?\" Lots of people ask that, too. As usual, I denied any preference. But red meat woman's counterattack was surprising: \"Wouldn't your husband like a little girl, though, really?\" I went home and asked him. \"Maybe,\" he said. \"Girls are easier to talk to.\" But then he went off into the garden to teach the cat football again, so I wasn't sure he meant it. The cat is a gifted dribbler, but he is never going to grasp offside. </p> <p>I wonder if I meant my denials, either. I keep referring to the baby as \"he\" - maybe I do think of him as masculine. And I think I might worry less about a boy, assume he was better able to take care of himself. It might be easier to have a little distance and not presume I understood everything he was going through - after all, I've always found men emotionally inscrutable. Little boys rushing off on mysterious missions, or filled with a need to kick something, or getting obsessions with Romans or cars or dinosaurs, seem simply and pleasantly foreign to me. </p> <p>Girls, though, are scary. I watched a line of 11-year-olds in the swimming pool changing rooms today, waiting for the hairdryer. The girl under the dryer had a mini-skirt and glitter eye make-up, and looked, as 11-year-olds alarmingly can, like a fashion model. The next in line had a transparent mac and pedalpushers, and was devotedly straightening her friend's fringe. The third had a tummy sticking out of a sweatshirt, poor posture and was not, you could tell, going to make it to the dryer at all. </p> <p> Lolita, best friend, victim - I have all too strong an idea of what is going on in each of those little girls' heads and wouldn't want my daughter to be any of them. So I would intervene, demand confidences, insist I knew best, fail, as mothers have been doing for generations, to draw a line between her pain and my pain, her body and my body. Before I knew what was happening, I would be Aurelia Plath. </p> <p>I think I'll stop there. My pregnancy book advises me to \"take a little time every day to imagine life with the baby\". But I don't think this sort of speculation can really be what it has in mind. After all, whatever I'm going to give birth to, it won't be a fully-made-up tweenie. Tweenies may even be pass\u00e9 in a decade's time and children will be allowed to play Hares and Hounds in mixed-gender groups again. Next time someone asks: \"What is it?\" I'll say: \"A baby.\" Very firmly.</p>",

We seem to be going backwards: until the 19th century, all children wore the same long clothes and curls till they were five or six. Maybe they were more secure in their gender identity then. And when did teddies fall from grace and start covering their parts? I'm sure my teddy was nude, neuter and unashamed. Some gender assumptions, of course, aren't modern at all. \"It's a boy,\" proclaimed a woman in the butcher's, eyeing my bag of steak (full: my blood fixation continues). Then, seeing I was taken aback: \"Isn't that what you want?\" Lots of people ask that, too. As usual, I denied any preference. But red meat woman's counterattack was surprising: \"Wouldn't your husband like a little girl, though, really?\" I went home and asked him. \"Maybe,\" he said. \"Girls are easier to talk to.\" But then he went off into the garden to teach the cat football again, so I wasn't sure he meant it. The cat is a gifted dribbler, but he is never going to grasp offside. I wonder if I meant my denials, either. I keep referring to the baby as \"he\" - maybe I do think of him as masculine. And I think I might worry less about a boy, assume he was better able to take care of himself. It might be easier to have a little distance and not presume I understood everything he was going through - after all, I've always found men emotionally inscrutable. Little boys rushing off on mysterious missions, or filled with a need to kick something, or getting obsessions with Romans or cars or dinosaurs, seem simply and pleasantly foreign to me. Girls, though, are scary. I watched a line of 11-year-olds in the swimming pool changing rooms today, waiting for the hairdryer. The girl under the dryer had a mini-skirt and glitter eye make-up, and looked, as 11-year-olds alarmingly can, like a fashion model. The next in line had a transparent mac and pedalpushers, and was devotedly straightening her friend's fringe. The third had a tummy sticking out of a sweatshirt, poor posture and was not, you could tell, going to make it to the dryer at all. Lolita, best friend, victim - I have all too strong an idea of what is going on in each of those little girls' heads and wouldn't want my daughter to be any of them. So I would intervene, demand confidences, insist I knew best, fail, as mothers have been doing for generations, to draw a line between her pain and my pain, her body and my body. Before I knew what was happening, I would be Aurelia Plath. I think I'll stop there. My pregnancy book advises me to \"take a little time every day to imagine life with the baby\". But I don't think this sort of speculation can really be what it has in mind. After all, whatever I'm going to give birth to, it won't be a fully-made-up tweenie. Tweenies may even be pass\u00e9 in a decade's time and children will be allowed to play Hares and Hounds in mixed-gender groups again. Next time someone asks: \"What is it?\" I'll say: \"A baby.\" Very firmly.",

After completing psychology degrees at Rhodes University, he went to Cambridge to study with Oliver Zangwill, who was to become professor of psychology.</p> <p>At the outbreak of the war, Shapiro, who had joined the Communist party in the 1930s, volunteered for aircrew duties and was assigned as a navigator/bomb aimer, though he had hopeless spatial skills.

At that time, the nascent discipline of clinical psychology was confined largely to psychological testing, and the group of psychologists at the institute began work to apply scientific psychology to clinical problems. Early work included Eysenck's critical review, which undermined the contemporary claims for the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Shapiro's contributions were perhaps more subtle, but similarly long-lasting.</p> <p>Convinced that psychological treatments should be based on scientific principles, Shapiro and his colleagues began to investigate the implications of Pavlov's psychology, and the work of other theorists, in a series of seminars. Members of the department also conducted experimental case analyses of clinical problems using the principles derived from theory.</p> <p>The marriage of theory, and the application of experimental methods to single cases, was again apparent in Shapiro's second contribution to clinical psychology. From 1951 onwards, he published a series of papers applying an experimental method to diagnostic problems, which, in many ways, foreshadowed developments in the field of neuropsychology 25 years later.</p> <p>Shapiro's third significant contribution came with the extension of single-case methods into problems where the subjective report of the patient, rather than performance on a cognitive test, was the focus of inquiry. He recognised the limitations in the available measures and devised a personal questionnaire method for scaling an individual's self-reported symptoms. The questionnaire cleverly exploited robust pair comparison methodology to provide rapid scoring and inherent reliability checks.</p> <p>In the clinic, Shapiro was a man of infinite patience: tolerant, empathic and non-judgmental. To students, he was both encouraging and demanding. If an answer to a question was not apparent, one would be briefed to research the literature before the next clinical supervision. This then became the basis for an exhaustive inquiry into the validity of one's conclusions and the merits of the literature.</p> <p>Shapiro left the Communist party in 1956 after Krushchev's denunciation of Stalin. He became dogmatically opposed to dogma and, at the institute, his opposition to the house line - crudely expressed as \"behaviour therapy good, psychoanalysis bad\" - was refreshing to many junior colleagues. He was nevertheless a man of strong convictions, which sometimes led to ruptures in working relationships and demanded tolerance from his family. He was also extraordinarily self-critical. He wrote slowly, constantly redrafting his papers, much to the chagrin of secretarial colleagues.</p> <p>Shapiro was never awarded a professorship, although many believed he merited one. At a dinner to celebrate 25 years at the institute, colleagues presented him with a splendid leather chair in place of the academic position he never had.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Jean, and their children, David and Rose.</p> <p>Monte Bernard Shapiro, clinical psychologist, born May 31 1912; died April 29 2000</p>",

Shapiro's third significant contribution came with the extension of single-case methods into problems where the subjective report of the patient, rather than performance on a cognitive test, was the focus of inquiry. He recognised the limitations in the available measures and devised a personal questionnaire method for scaling an individual's self-reported symptoms. The questionnaire cleverly exploited robust pair comparison methodology to provide rapid scoring and inherent reliability checks. In the clinic, Shapiro was a man of infinite patience: tolerant, empathic and non-judgmental. To students, he was both encouraging and demanding. If an answer to a question was not apparent, one would be briefed to research the literature before the next clinical supervision. This then became the basis for an exhaustive inquiry into the validity of one's conclusions and the merits of the literature. Shapiro left the Communist party in 1956 after Krushchev's denunciation of Stalin. He became dogmatically opposed to dogma and, at the institute, his opposition to the house line - crudely expressed as \"behaviour therapy good, psychoanalysis bad\" - was refreshing to many junior colleagues. He was nevertheless a man of strong convictions, which sometimes led to ruptures in working relationships and demanded tolerance from his family. He was also extraordinarily self-critical. He wrote slowly, constantly redrafting his papers, much to the chagrin of secretarial colleagues. Shapiro was never awarded a professorship, although many believed he merited one. At a dinner to celebrate 25 years at the institute, colleagues presented him with a splendid leather chair in place of the academic position he never had. He is survived by his wife, Jean, and their children, David and Rose. Monte Bernard Shapiro, clinical psychologist, born May 31 1912; died April 29 2000",

So sang the Shirelles in 1961, voicing one of the classic female dilemmas. Should you have sex on the first date? And if you do, will he respect you afterwards? Or, as Shirley put it: \"Will my heart be broken when the night meets the morning sun?\"</p> <p>What absurdly antediluvian worries, you may be thinking. Of course you should sleep with him, if you want to. Of course he'll respect you because modern men are comfortable with female self-determination. Haven't the last few years taught him that, for women, sex no longer necessarily equals that supposed ultimate male terror, commitment? With magazines like Company boasting such lyrical headlines as \"Come like a train - whenever you want\" it must be obvious to him that a woman is as capable as a man of detaching herself emotionally from the act, placing her own gratification ahead of such abstractions as who respects whom.</p> <p>Except that, as we all know, these brave-new-world fantasies exist only in the pages of magazines like Company. Women still agonise over whether doing it on the first date means goodbye to any chance of a relationship, while men still tend to think less of girls who put out. And almost four decades of feminism has done little to alter the imbalance. A new book by Prozac Nation author Elizabeth Wurtzel makes a stab at pretending things have changed. \"It doesn't matter when you sleep with someone for the first time,\" The Bitch Rules argues - but in real life we haven't progressed all that far since the Shirelles asked: \"Can I believe the magic of your sighs?\"</p> <p>Even The Bitch Rules (a riposte to bestselling dating manual The Rules, which advocated a return to traditional femininity) concedes \"often women become more needy and insecure\" after crossing the great divide that is sex with a new partner. That's because, even if one's primary goal is to come like a train, there is usually some emotional investment, since female brains are hardwired to crave permanence. No amount of ladette braggadocio can change that. Even my friend Holly, who has slept with \"around 60\" blokes and claims she often uses them just for sex, says: \"I can just shag someone and feel OK about it, but I do desperately want a relationship.\"</p> <p>The way to a relationship, it seems, is to do what The Rules suggests: wait. For weeks, if not months. Wait till the second date, at the very least. Unless a man is Peter Stringfellow (more of whom later), he will almost certainly be unimpressed by a woman who is too willing too early. That's the advice from both 31-year- old Robert, who has had 35 partners, and Mark, 33, who has had just four. Robert says: \"If I liked a girl and wanted to establish a relationship, I would rather go for the thrill of the chase. If I were drunk or on one, I'd have sex on a first date, but I probably wouldn't call her again and I wouldn't want her to call me.\"</p> <p>Mark, meanwhile, trots out the age-old refrain: \"If a girl will sleep with you on the first night, you wonder if she does it with everyone.\"</p> <p>At this point, we should establish the difference between a date - which is pre-arranged and usually involves expectations of getting to know someone better - and tumbling into bed in a vodka stupor with someone you met two hours ago at a party. Women are becoming more aggressive in the latter category - they're often the ones doing the asking, emboldened by the examples set by celebrity ladettes. This is where women's magazines have actually had a hand in shaping the zeitgeist. Holly says: \"Women don't feel so guilty now about uncomplicated sex and magazines have helped them feel like that. They write about sex because it sells, but the message about taking control of your sex life does get through.\"</p> <p>Jo Elvin, editor of New Woman (whose current issue includes the feature It's Sex Week: Seven Reasons To Say Yes... Yes... Yes... Yes... Yes... Yes... Yes...) is pleased to hear it. \"Our readers do have sexual confidence. They meet men and think: 'He's nice, but he's not the one.' But they don't want to miss having a good time, so sex is less complicated.\"</p> <p>Almost as an afterthought, she adds: \"But they also want to meet The One. We run a lot of stories on commitment and babies.\"</p> <p>Women these days fairly brim with sexual confidence, if by \"confidence\" we mean initiating contact and asking men out. Once past 30, especially, you are less likely to jump through hoops just to impress the opposite sex. As Robert says: \"Older women know what they want, which is very sexy.\"</p> <p>But despite the impression of liberation and empowerment, sex is rarely as uncomplicated for women as Elvin suggests. Barring drunken one-night stands, they don't often enter a sexual relationship without at least some emotional involvement. Entering it on the first date creates a premature intimacy, according to Emma Harvey, a 37-year-old journalist: \"You take your clothes off in front of someone and you make yourself emotionally vulnerable.\" Withholding sex early in a relationship, as we all know, is instant empowerment, but once the line has been crossed, \"all your anxieties about yourself kick in\".</p> <p>Most of Harvey's recent dates have been through small ads, she says. She slept with one after their second meeting and they had arranged to meet again, but he never rang and didn't return her calls. \"You've been physically intimate with someone, so you're upset if you don't see them again,\" she comments, adding that she might have felt less angry about his rudeness if they hadn't had sex.</p> <p>Oops, there we go again, silly hormonal women emotionalising attraction. Can't we just approach sex as men do, as a bodily function to be savoured, with or without the complications of a relationship? Well, it depends on whether we want it to retain some meaning or just be added to our repertoire of stunts, along the lines of Ulrika Jonsson's party trick of drinking a pint of beer in seven seconds.</p> <p>That said, sex on the first date can lead to long-term relationships, as long as there is mutual respect. This is from no less an authority than Peter Stringfellow, who has been with his latest much-younger girlfriend, a dancer at one of his clubs, for a year. \"The longest I've ever waited was two dates,\" he claims. \"If I want to have sex in the first place, I'll want to have sex again. If it's romantic and pleasant and you go to each other's apartment rather than ripping your clothes off in a car, there's nothing crude about doing it on the first date. I'll want to see her again.\"</p> <p>So if you're off on a first date with high hopes tonight, the choices apparently boil down either to following The Rules or going out with Peter Stringfellow. But there's a lot to be said for waiting, for deciding whether there's liking and respect there, before worrying about coming like a train.</p>",

PKZip allows software publishers to package many different programs into one file, which is easier for users to download. It uses sophisticated algorithms to compress the zip file and make it smaller, saving users countless hours of telephone time.</p> <p>Katz studied computer science at the University of Milwaukee-Wisconsin (UMW), where he used many archiving programs that worked like PKZip.

      "bodyText": "Phillip Katz, who has died aged 37, in a Milwaukee motel room of complications from alcholism, was the creator of one of the internet's most popular programs, PK Zip. Almost all the programs on the internet have been compressed into zip files, the format Katz developed and made popular though the Phil Katz Zip program. PKZip allows software publishers to package many different programs into one file, which is easier for users to download. It uses sophisticated algorithms to compress the zip file and make it smaller, saving users countless hours of telephone time. Katz studied computer science at the University of Milwaukee-Wisconsin (UMW), where he used many archiving programs that worked like PKZip. His first version, released in 1986, was called PK Pak, a name that chimed well with the local American football team, the Green Bay Packers.

The present chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham - a former army general nicknamed \"Rambo\" - has repeatedly clashed with Mr Straw over criminal justice policy in general, and in particular over Sir David's call for the early release of the boys who killed the toddler James Bulger. Fears have already been raised that Sir David's role as an independent watchdog will be curbed as a result of a merger with the probation inspectorate. He has proved a thorn in the side of prisons policy ever since he led an inspectors' walkout of Holloway prison because it was filthy and infested with rats. Sir David's five-year term expires in November and it is understood that he has been asked whether he wishes to continue. The Home Office has already drawn up plans for a much closer working relationship between the prisons and the probation service, although a recent internal review rejected a merger option. Home Office sources have stressed that the Home Office minister, Paul Boateng, is now responsible for the prisons and probation service and that the drive for more \"joined up government\" could mean a more effective scrutiny is provided by a merged inspectorate, but they stress that no decisions have yet been taken. They insist that ministers have no plans to change the legal role of chief inspector, which was last defined in 1952. Sir David was expected to take a low-key approach when he was appointed by the then home secretary, Michael Howard, in 1995. But a series of reports has proved him critical of prison conditions, even if he has shown himself more interested in internal bureaucratic structures than his predecessor, Sir Stephen Tumim, a former circuit court judge. It is believed that Mr Straw has not made any final decision over the future role of the chief inspector of prisons. But ministers were infuriated when Sir David proved unable to produce evidence to substantiate a claim he made in front of MPs that there were at least 10 drug barons in every prison. Prison service chiefs have since directly challenged some of the claims in his inspection reports, including allegations of brutality at Wandsworth prison in south London. The chief inspector of probation, Sir Graham Smith, is believed to be opposed to the move on the grounds that the two fields need different areas of expertise, and the plan has already been criticised in the House of Lords. Peers claimed a new title of \"chief inspector of corrections\" would be appalling and suggested that the independent watchdog has played a vital role in pressing the need for prison reform. Home Office ministers have recently praised Sir David's record, saying that his good reports on Pentonville, Werrington, Ashwell, Brockhill and Feltham prisons have outweighed his critical reports in recent months on Dorchester, Rochester and Portland jails.",

He learned to play guitar as a teenager and sang gospel harmonies with his father. In the 1940s, they appeared together as part of the Crook Brothers group on the Grand Ole Opry, Nashville's premier country-music radio show. After serving in the US army during the Korean war, Matt- hews returned home to study psychology at Belmont College, Nashville.</p> <p>He was invited to join the Jordanaires, led by Gordon Stoker, in 1953. The group had developed a modern sound based on barbershop-style close harmonies, and had already made a name for itself by supporting Red Foley on his 1950 million-seller, Just A Closer Walk With Thee. Matthews became second tenor to Stoker's lead tenor, with the other parts taken by Hoyt Hawkins (baritone) and Culley Holt (bass).</p> <p>The Jordanaires became regulars on Eddy Arnold's television programme, the first country-music show to be networked across America. They toured with Arnold and, in 1954, appeared at the Memphis Cotton Carnival, where the teenage Elvis Presley was among the audience. Two years later, Stoker was in the RCA recording studio as a backing singer on Elvis's recording of Heartbreak Hotel.</p> <p>The full Jordanaires line-up first featured on a Presley recording in 1956, when Matthews made on-the-spot arrangements for Don't Be Cruel and Hound Dog. For the latter, the group provided hand-clapping, as well as the \"aaah\" sounds that framed Scotty Moore's guitar solos. The song was recorded 31 times before Presley was satisfied he had the perfect version. After the session, he told the Jordanaires: \"If any of these songs goes big, I want you to record all my stuff with me\".</p> <p>Both songs were massive hits and subsequently the Jordanaires appeared on numerous Elvis Presley recordings, including the sound- tracks of almost all the 28 films in which he starred. Perhaps the apex of their collaboration was the 1960 religious album, His Hand In Mine. For this, Matthews created a series of arrangements for such hymns as Joshua Fit The Battle and Swing Low Sweet Chariot.</p> <p>The Jordanaires also appeared live with Presley, and on occasions the group - as well as the fans - would become so engrossed with Elvis's performance that they would forget to come in on cue. When that happened, Gordon Stoker recalled, \"he'd turn around and give us the lip\".</p> <p>In addition to their work with Elvis, the quartet was in constant demand for recording sessions arranged by the top Nashville producers Chet Atkins and Owen Bradley. Their sweet, at times sickly, harmonies contributed to a new country-pop music, epitomised by such singers as Jim Reeves, Faron Young and Patsy Cline - the Jordanaires sang on her famous recording, I Fall To Pieces. Outside country music, they made albums with Julie Andrews and Steve Lawrence.</p> <p>The Jordanaires also made their own recordings. Sugaree was a minor hit in 1956, while their 1964 album with Tennessee Ernie Ford, Great Gospel Songs, won a Grammy award as best gospel album. When Presley died in 1977, the Jordanaires contributed to the tribute album, My Farewell to Elvis: From Graceland To the Promised Land, recorded by Merle Haggard, and later made their own recording of Elvis's Favourite Spirituals. They even graced the records and shows of Elvis imperson- ators, while Matthews himself wrote a memoir, Elvis: A Golden Tribute, that was published in 1985.</p> <p>The group continued to record and tour, and in the 1990s were much in demand.

Significant Christians from western Europe, the United States and a few from the third world (neither cold warriors nor fellow travellers) were invited to join - and accepted. In 1964, though not without misgivings, I (then the British Council of Churches's east Europe secretary ) joined its executive.</p> <p>Ondra was born in southern Bohemia, and had secretly begun to study theology under the Nazis. He was ordained in 1949 and became pastor of a Prague congregation six years later. It was from there that he was called to the CPC and the Czech Ecumenical Council.</p> <p>He travelled widely in the 1960s, working alongside the theologians Milan Opocensky and Jan Milic Lochman. Their objective was to be as closely integrated as possible with world Christendom, an aspiration that chimed well with the anti-Stalinist forces in the Czech Communist party which installed Alexander Dubcek as party leader.</p> <p>The 1968 Prague Spring seemed to be a fulfilment of Hromadka's vision. But the Soviet pressures remained relentless - even before the August invasion - and Ondra flew to London to tell me that the Russian Orthodox church (the main CPC paymasters) had threatened to withdraw their support if he did not remove me from the executive on account of my allegedly anti-Soviet influence - my insistence on raising human rights issues. I resigned to save Ondra's position.</p> <p>After the Soviet invasion the CPC was forcibly \"normalised\". The major western supporters left; Ondra was sacked; Hromadka resigned in solidarity, and died broken-hearted. Opocensky and Lochman both built theological careers in the west. Though some people of integrity tried to rebuild it, the CPC's credibility had gone. Unemployed, Ondra began to study law. No hero by nature, he did not join the open opposition of Charter 77. In many ways, he reflected the brokenness of most Czech people but remained a charming and affable host. Eventually, he received permission to teach ecumenical theology in the seminary of his church.</p> <p>It was a tough assignment for, despite his treatment at communist hands, he was identified in the minds of many of his students with a policy of appeasement which they could not understand. It is not uncommon for the diplomat, the reconciler, to be rejected by both sides when attitudes harden.</p> <p>When history can be written objectively, I do not think that Hromadka and his disciples will be judged harshly. After the peaceful revolution of 1990, those who had been silenced for so long became the muted voices of today's church, but Ondra's health was beginning to fail. Free to travel, he enjoyed visiting friends in the west, and was still the good company he always had been.</p> <p>With advancing Alzheimer's, his last years were spent in a home. He is survived by his wife Vera and their son.</p> <p>Jaroslav Nemec Ondra, pastor, born March 18 1925; died April 8 2000</p>",

Ondra was born in southern Bohemia, and had secretly begun to study theology under the Nazis. He was ordained in 1949 and became pastor of a Prague congregation six years later. It was from there that he was called to the CPC and the Czech Ecumenical Council. He travelled widely in the 1960s, working alongside the theologians Milan Opocensky and Jan Milic Lochman. Their objective was to be as closely integrated as possible with world Christendom, an aspiration that chimed well with the anti-Stalinist forces in the Czech Communist party which installed Alexander Dubcek as party leader. The 1968 Prague Spring seemed to be a fulfilment of Hromadka's vision. But the Soviet pressures remained relentless - even before the August invasion - and Ondra flew to London to tell me that the Russian Orthodox church (the main CPC paymasters) had threatened to withdraw their support if he did not remove me from the executive on account of my allegedly anti-Soviet influence - my insistence on raising human rights issues. I resigned to save Ondra's position. After the Soviet invasion the CPC was forcibly \"normalised\". The major western supporters left; Ondra was sacked; Hromadka resigned in solidarity, and died broken-hearted. Opocensky and Lochman both built theological careers in the west. Though some people of integrity tried to rebuild it, the CPC's credibility had gone. Unemployed, Ondra began to study law. No hero by nature, he did not join the open opposition of Charter 77. In many ways, he reflected the brokenness of most Czech people but remained a charming and affable host. Eventually, he received permission to teach ecumenical theology in the seminary of his church. It was a tough assignment for, despite his treatment at communist hands, he was identified in the minds of many of his students with a policy of appeasement which they could not understand. It is not uncommon for the diplomat, the reconciler, to be rejected by both sides when attitudes harden. When history can be written objectively, I do not think that Hromadka and his disciples will be judged harshly. After the peaceful revolution of 1990, those who had been silenced for so long became the muted voices of today's church, but Ondra's health was beginning to fail. Free to travel, he enjoyed visiting friends in the west, and was still the good company he always had been. With advancing Alzheimer's, his last years were spent in a home. He is survived by his wife Vera and their son. Jaroslav Nemec Ondra, pastor, born March 18 1925; died April 8 2000",

It will consider the issue when it meets in June.</p> <p>The heart of the scheme is Wicken Fen which supports more wildlife in a small area than nearly anywhere else in Britain. Occupying 800 acres, it is a tiny fragment of the vast fen wilderness that once occupied much of East Anglia.</p> <p>The problem is that despite its richness, it is a jewel in a barren landscape and species are gradually being lost. The plan is to reverse that process.</p> <p>Most of the land round Wicken is below sea level and prone to flooding, making it sparsely populated. Farming is viable only with constant pumping. When the pumps are turned off centuries of drainage will be reversed and Wicken's reedbeds and grazing marshes will be extended six miles to the outskirts of Cambridge.</p> <p>Established a century ago, Wicken is the country's oldest national nature reserve, and has served as an outdoor laboratory for generations of Cambridge scientists. In the early 19th century a young Charles Darwin was drawn to the area, fascinated by its 1,000 different beetles.</p> <p>Insects are present in exceptional variety: 212 species of spider, 1,000 moths, and 1,700 flies, many unknown anywhere else.

      "bodyText": "The National Trust is planning to buy and flood 14 square miles of top grade farmland in one of the most ambitious wildlife projects undertaken in Britain. The move would secure the survival of hundreds of threatened plants and animals by transforming bleak and intensively cultivated fenland into a vast wetland nature reserve twice the size of the trust's recent Snowdon purchase. Habitat recreation on such a scale has never before been attempted in England, according to the trust, and would have to be a gradual affair since the farmland involved is among the richest and most expensive in Britain. The move, which marks a radical policy shift, must be confirmed by the trust's executive. It will consider the issue when it meets in June. The heart of the scheme is Wicken Fen which supports more wildlife in a small area than nearly anywhere else in Britain. Occupying 800 acres, it is a tiny fragment of the vast fen wilderness that once occupied much of East Anglia. The problem is that despite its richness, it is a jewel in a barren landscape and species are gradually being lost. The plan is to reverse that process. Most of the land round Wicken is below sea level and prone to flooding, making it sparsely populated. Farming is viable only with constant pumping. When the pumps are turned off centuries of drainage will be reversed and Wicken's reedbeds and grazing marshes will be extended six miles to the outskirts of Cambridge. Established a century ago, Wicken is the country's oldest national nature reserve, and has served as an outdoor laboratory for generations of Cambridge scientists. In the early 19th century a young Charles Darwin was drawn to the area, fascinated by its 1,000 different beetles. Insects are present in exceptional variety: 212 species of spider, 1,000 moths, and 1,700 flies, many unknown anywhere else. Other rare species include marsh harriers, hen harriers, otters, and threatened wildflowers such as fen violet and milk parsley. Species have been disappearing from Wicken for decades despite maximum protection under British and EU law. Losses include five out of 19 dragonflies, four beetles, water vole, Montagu's harrier, marsh warbler, short-eared owl, and 35 flowering plants. A fifth beetle - the twin-spot longhorn - is under threat. Adrian Colston, the reserve's manager, said that although Wicken is the third biggest reserve in Cambridgeshire, it suffers as an island in a sea of hostile farmland and is too small to protect wildlife effectively. \"The average nature reserve in this area is 35 acres but that's hopelessly small,\" he said. \"If a cow dungs in the wrong place or someone treads on the wrong spot, that can wipe out a vulnerable species.\" He predicted the return of many vanished creatures to a bigger reserve and said greater populations of species would be much less vulnerable to drought, bad weather or other mishap.

      "body": "<p>China yesterday began a week-long holiday aimed at getting its sluggish economy going again.The traditional May Day break has been extended to seven days in a desperate attempt to break a three year deflationary spiral that has sent unemployment soaring.</p> <p>More than 10m Chinese are expected to flock to beaches and remote areas such as Tibet, as well as recently-built theme parks and holiday resorts.</p> <p>Beijing is struggling to boost consumer spending. China's economy grew by only 7.1% last year, too slow to create jobs for the millions being laid-off by bankrupt state-owned enterprises, who have staged sporadic and violent protests. The economy is expected to perform only slightly better this year.</p> <p>But the week-long holiday seems to be helping. A Beijing survey found that travelling families expect to spend an average of about 1,558 yuan (\u00a3123) over the next seven days, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.</p> <p>This is a sizeable sum in Chinese terms, amounting to several months' wages, even for relatively affluent urban dwellers.</p> <p>Some are choosing to venture abroad instead, following the loosening of restrictions on the issue of passports. Package tours to southeast Asian and even European destinations reportedly sold out long in advance of this week's holiday, as these are still the only way most people can legally travel overseas.</p> <p>But there are fears that Chinese holidaymakers' lack of experience makes them easy prey for unscrupulous tour agencies and other rip-off artists.</p> <p>\"The food was terrible and the hotels unbearable. Even worse were the obligatory stops at endless special tourism sites,\" said Xiao Quan, who works in south-western China.</p> <p>He joined a\u00a335 tour to the southern island of Hainan, which has beaches that have been dubbed \"China's Hawaii\", only to find the three day trip degenerate into an exercise in milking as much money as possible from him, as he was dragged from one souvenir shop to another.</p> <p>\"Worst of all was the traditional medicine show,\" he complained. \"After an electric current was passed through the audience, women in white shirts rushed to diagnose all kinds of illnesses and dispense healing potions for a hefty fee.\"</p> <p>Zhang Yuanchao, of the Chinese consumer association, said that being forced to visit souvenir shops, where the guide receives a commission, was the most common source of protests. The association received a record 5,330 complaints about travel agencies last year, up 41% from 1998.</p> <p>Even those who venture overseas do not necessarily fare any better. Beijing lawyer Liu Chi is suing a Chinese travel agency and its Swiss partners for embezzlement and misleading advertising in a Lausanne court after a trip to see the 1998 World Cup in France went badly wrong.</p> <p>He said the agencies never provided the promised match tickets and forced the 22-strong tour party to cross Switzerland by coach rather than plane, despite spending \u00a32,520 a head on the tour package.</p>",

      "bodyText": "China yesterday began a week-long holiday aimed at getting its sluggish economy going again.The traditional May Day break has been extended to seven days in a desperate attempt to break a three year deflationary spiral that has sent unemployment soaring. More than 10m Chinese are expected to flock to beaches and remote areas such as Tibet, as well as recently-built theme parks and holiday resorts. Beijing is struggling to boost consumer spending. China's economy grew by only 7.1% last year, too slow to create jobs for the millions being laid-off by bankrupt state-owned enterprises, who have staged sporadic and violent protests. The economy is expected to perform only slightly better this year. But the week-long holiday seems to be helping. A Beijing survey found that travelling families expect to spend an average of about 1,558 yuan (\u00a3123) over the next seven days, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. This is a sizeable sum in Chinese terms, amounting to several months' wages, even for relatively affluent urban dwellers. Some are choosing to venture abroad instead, following the loosening of restrictions on the issue of passports. Package tours to southeast Asian and even European destinations reportedly sold out long in advance of this week's holiday, as these are still the only way most people can legally travel overseas. But there are fears that Chinese holidaymakers' lack of experience makes them easy prey for unscrupulous tour agencies and other rip-off artists. \"The food was terrible and the hotels unbearable. Even worse were the obligatory stops at endless special tourism sites,\" said Xiao Quan, who works in south-western China. He joined a\u00a335 tour to the southern island of Hainan, which has beaches that have been dubbed \"China's Hawaii\", only to find the three day trip degenerate into an exercise in milking as much money as possible from him, as he was dragged from one souvenir shop to another. \"Worst of all was the traditional medicine show,\" he complained. \"After an electric current was passed through the audience, women in white shirts rushed to diagnose all kinds of illnesses and dispense healing potions for a hefty fee.\" Zhang Yuanchao, of the Chinese consumer association, said that being forced to visit souvenir shops, where the guide receives a commission, was the most common source of protests. The association received a record 5,330 complaints about travel agencies last year, up 41% from 1998. Even those who venture overseas do not necessarily fare any better. Beijing lawyer Liu Chi is suing a Chinese travel agency and its Swiss partners for embezzlement and misleading advertising in a Lausanne court after a trip to see the 1998 World Cup in France went badly wrong. He said the agencies never provided the promised match tickets and forced the 22-strong tour party to cross Switzerland by coach rather than plane, despite spending \u00a32,520 a head on the tour package.",

      "bodyText": "Thirty years after they split up the Beatles are still the best British band of all time, according to a poll published yesterday. A survey of the 100 greatest British albums compiled by writers and critics at Q magazine, monthly journal of grown-up rockers everywhere, is headed by the band's 1966 album Revolver. Four other Beatles albums, A Hard Day's Night (5th), The Beatles (7th), Sgt Peppers' Lonely Hearts Club Band (13th) and Abbey Road (17th) feature in the top 20, and a sixth, Rubber Soul, is at no 21. David Bowie is the next best-represented artist with four albums in the top 100, while the Rolling Stones have three, led by Exile on Main Street at no 3. But Radiohead's 1997 prog-rock pastiche OK Computer leads the way for the under 40s at no 2, while Oasis and Massive Attack also make it into the top 10. The Clash's 1979 London Calling is at no 4, six places higher than Never Mind the Bollocks by the Sex Pistols. Astral Weeks by Van Morrison completes the top 10. Q editor Andy Pemberton believes the list confirms that the 1990s were British music's \"second golden age\" - 34 of the 100 come from the last decade - but that only Radiohead appear to have the staying power of the previous generation. There is room for the innovators and eccentrics who have lent British rock much of its colour. Nick Drake's Bryter Later is at no 23, Ian Dury and the Blockheads' New Boots and Panties!! at no 66, and New Order's Low Life creeps into 97th place.

      "body": "<p><strong>Valencia CF:</strong> Canizares, Pellegrino, Djukic, Carboni, Angloma, Mendieta, Farinos, Gerard, Gonzalez, Angulo, Lopez. <br>Substitutes: Bartual Molina, Bjorklund, Oscar, Ilie, Sanchez, Albelda, Gerardo.<br></p> <p><strong>FC Barcelona:</strong> Hesp, Reiziger, F. de Boer, Puyol, Guardiola, Cocu, Zenden, Rivaldo, Gabri, Kluivert, Dani. <br>Substitutes: Arnau, Abelardo, Litmanen, Sergi, Bogarde, Simao, Xavi.<br></p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Urs Meier (Switzerland) <br></p> <p>Valencia will be looking to win this first-leg tie handsomely, as their away form this season, both domestically and in the Champions League, has been poor. The 5-2 demolition of Lazio in the last Champions League match to be played at the Mestalla showed that Valencia are capable of beating any team in Europe at home. A lot depends on which Barcelona we see tonight - the muted side that turned out at Stamford Bridge, or the glorious unit that destroyed Chelsea in the return leg?</p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Barcelona kick off to a cacophony of whistles. When Valencia gain possession, the home side instantly try and find playmaker and captain Mendieta, who has started wide on the right.<br> <strong>3</strong> The first meaningful attack comes from Valencia, who break down the right through Djukic, who feeds Carboni. The cross is deep enough, but too near Hesp, who collects under his crossbar.<br><strong>5</strong> Mendieta and Angulo combines well on the right to force a corner. The centre is wasted and Barcelona clear with ease.<br><strong>6</strong> Valencia attack again, through Angloma who is unceremoniously dumped on his behind by Guardiola. The Swiss official is unmoved and tells Angolma to get up and get on with it.<br><strong>7</strong> Angulo provides what is almost the perfect cross from the right. Mendieta, who has shirked his marker, rises unopposed over the penalty spot, but the cross is a shade too high. Barca's marking was woeful.<br><strong>9</strong> Another corner for Valencia, again from the right. All the attacking play is coming from the home side during these opening moments.<br><strong>11 GOAL! Valencia 1 - 0 Barcelona</strong> Barcelona are slow to clear a corner, and the ball falls to Angulo 15 yards out. His right foot makes no mistake and sends the ball rising past Hesp into the roof of the net and the Mestalla goes nuts.<br><strong>13</strong> Barca have two chances to equalize, and they both fall to the European Player of the Year, Rivaldo. His first, a header from point-blank range after a corner from the left, is palmed out by Canizares. From the restart, Rivaldo latches onto a weak back-pass and breaks towards the Valencia goal, pursued by Pellegrino. The defender does just enough to cause Rivaldo to screw his shot wide across the Valencia goal.<br><strong>17</strong> Barcelona, encouraged by Rivaldo's forays and stung by the goal they conceded, have finally decided to start playing. Guardiola feeds Zenden on the left, who is fouled by Pellegrino. The free kick is headed out and Valencia break.<br><strong>20</strong> Barcelona are very much a one man show at the moment. Rivaldo picks up a loose ball just outside the area and drives a rising half-volley just over the crossbar.<br><strong>21</strong> Farinos, with the unenviable task of marking Rivaldo, wrestles his charge to the ground to end one of his foraging runs, and is <strong>booked</strong> for his trouble.<br><strong>24</strong> Carboni, who is unfortunate enough to play a cross onto Guardiola's back, finds himself running back at full pelt to deal with the Barca attack he unwittingly started. He runs back 70 yards to cut out Zenden's cross from the left.<br><strong>26</strong> Claudio Lopez feeds Gonzalez on the left, in space. His pace takes him clear of Puyol and his rasping shot hits Hesp's near upright. The rebound is picked up by Lopez, who from a good 25 yards out drills the ball into the bottom corner. The linesman has spotted a foul and the 'goal' will not count.<br><strong>27 GOAL! Valencia 1 - 1 Barcelona</strong> Shades of Roy Keane as Zenden, in space on the left, slides in a low cross aimed at Kluivert. Pellegrino, sliding in full-stretch, pokes the ball into his own net, wrong-footing Canizares.

      "bodyText": "Valencia CF: Canizares, Pellegrino, Djukic, Carboni, Angloma, Mendieta, Farinos, Gerard, Gonzalez, Angulo, Lopez. Substitutes: Bartual Molina, Bjorklund, Oscar, Ilie, Sanchez, Albelda, Gerardo. FC Barcelona: Hesp, Reiziger, F. de Boer, Puyol, Guardiola, Cocu, Zenden, Rivaldo, Gabri, Kluivert, Dani. Substitutes: Arnau, Abelardo, Litmanen, Sergi, Bogarde, Simao, Xavi. Referee: Urs Meier (Switzerland) Valencia will be looking to win this first-leg tie handsomely, as their away form this season, both domestically and in the Champions League, has been poor. The 5-2 demolition of Lazio in the last Champions League match to be played at the Mestalla showed that Valencia are capable of beating any team in Europe at home. A lot depends on which Barcelona we see tonight - the muted side that turned out at Stamford Bridge, or the glorious unit that destroyed Chelsea in the return leg? 1 min Barcelona kick off to a cacophony of whistles. When Valencia gain possession, the home side instantly try and find playmaker and captain Mendieta, who has started wide on the right. 3 The first meaningful attack comes from Valencia, who break down the right through Djukic, who feeds Carboni. The cross is deep enough, but too near Hesp, who collects under his crossbar. 5 Mendieta and Angulo combines well on the right to force a corner. The centre is wasted and Barcelona clear with ease. 6 Valencia attack again, through Angloma who is unceremoniously dumped on his behind by Guardiola. The Swiss official is unmoved and tells Angolma to get up and get on with it. 7 Angulo provides what is almost the perfect cross from the right. Mendieta, who has shirked his marker, rises unopposed over the penalty spot, but the cross is a shade too high. Barca's marking was woeful. 9 Another corner for Valencia, again from the right. All the attacking play is coming from the home side during these opening moments. 11 GOAL! Valencia 1 - 0 Barcelona Barcelona are slow to clear a corner, and the ball falls to Angulo 15 yards out. His right foot makes no mistake and sends the ball rising past Hesp into the roof of the net and the Mestalla goes nuts. 13 Barca have two chances to equalize, and they both fall to the European Player of the Year, Rivaldo. His first, a header from point-blank range after a corner from the left, is palmed out by Canizares. From the restart, Rivaldo latches onto a weak back-pass and breaks towards the Valencia goal, pursued by Pellegrino. The defender does just enough to cause Rivaldo to screw his shot wide across the Valencia goal. 17 Barcelona, encouraged by Rivaldo's forays and stung by the goal they conceded, have finally decided to start playing. Guardiola feeds Zenden on the left, who is fouled by Pellegrino. The free kick is headed out and Valencia break. 20 Barcelona are very much a one man show at the moment. Rivaldo picks up a loose ball just outside the area and drives a rising half-volley just over the crossbar. 21 Farinos, with the unenviable task of marking Rivaldo, wrestles his charge to the ground to end one of his foraging runs, and is booked for his trouble. 24 Carboni, who is unfortunate enough to play a cross onto Guardiola's back, finds himself running back at full pelt to deal with the Barca attack he unwittingly started. He runs back 70 yards to cut out Zenden's cross from the left. 26 Claudio Lopez feeds Gonzalez on the left, in space. His pace takes him clear of Puyol and his rasping shot hits Hesp's near upright. The rebound is picked up by Lopez, who from a good 25 yards out drills the ball into the bottom corner. The linesman has spotted a foul and the 'goal' will not count. 27 GOAL! Valencia 1 - 1 Barcelona Shades of Roy Keane as Zenden, in space on the left, slides in a low cross aimed at Kluivert. Pellegrino, sliding in full-stretch, pokes the ball into his own net, wrong-footing Canizares. All that Barca pressure pays off at last. 32 A lot more ball for Barcelona since the goal. A free kick on the right, taken by Guardiola. Play is switched to Zenden on the left, and Angloma flies in with a tackle that makes the Dutchman wish he'd never been born. Strangely enough, the referee decides against a caution. 37 Valencia's Kily Gonzalez, always a handful on the left, is bundled over by the hapless Puyol, who is pretty much at the end of his tether. After Puyol is booked, play restarts but the set-piece is wasted. 40 Carboni and Gonzalez exchange three, four, five passes on the left touchline, before feeding Mendieta on the left of the Barca area. The Valencia skipper goes down dramatically as soon as Cocu brushes his shoulder. Despite what the crowd think, the referee is not impressed. 42 Gabri kicks Gerard under the referee's nose, and then looks surprised when he is booked. 43 GOAL! Valencia 2 - 1 Barcelona Kily Gonzalez can do no wrong tonight. A perfectly weighted cross from the left is met by Angulo, holding off two defenders. His rising drive soars past Hesp at his near post and it's no more than the home side deserve. 44 Penalty to Valencia Kily Gonzalez and Carboni play passing triangles on the left, before slotting the ball through to Mendieta, who plays a first-time side foot pass to Angulo.

Time Warner said it would stop carrying the ABC channel - effectively shutting out the Disney-owned network from 11 US cities including New York. The decision was taken after the two corporations failed to agree new transmission terms before a deadline of midnight on Sunday. ABC immediately appealed to US regulators to force Time Warner to stop blocking access to its cable television network. It accused Time Warner, which is to merge with America Online, the world's largest internet service provider, of acting illegally and of abusing its market position. The federal communications commission is reviewing the AOL Time Warner merger and has already received complaints from consumer groups about the increased power created by the deal. Bruce Gordon, the president of ABC in North Carolina, told Bloomberg news agency: \"This blackout is a frightening foreshadowing of the implications of the Time Warner-AOL merger.\" ABC is also expected to suffer falling audiences during the month-long ratings period local television stations use to set advertising rates in the US. Talks over a new transmission contract have been going on since the end of last year, just before the AOL acquisition was announced. Time Warner yesterday accused ABC of trying to extract \"excessive and unreasonable terms for its cable television channels\". It had objected to ABC's attempt to have the Disney Channel and other services offered in the cable company's basic package to consumers, saying that such a deal would cost about $300m. It pulled the plug on some 3.5m homes after failing to reach a deal. A broadcast announcement transmitted in place of normal programmes read: \"Disney has taken ABC away from you.\" It promised to provide substitute programming as soon as possible. Shares in Disney and Time Warner fell slightly yesterday. Analysts said the dispute would not seriously hurt earnings unless they were still unresolved in a few weeks' time.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Bradford are still alive, Wimbledon merely livid. After dominating much of a tense, scrappy match yesterday Wimbledon went home with their Premiership status looking more precarious than ever.</p> <p>A bizarre sequence of events led to a Bradford win which sent Wimbledon into the bottom three for the first time this season and Paul Jewell's team moved up to a place of safety for the first time this century. Now, whatever Wimbledon do, Bradford will stay up if they win their last two games.</p> <p>Not that the denouement is likely to be that simple. For one thing Wimbledon have the easier fixtures: at home to an Aston Villa side with the FA Cup final on their minds followed by sleepy Southampton at the Dell. Bradford go to Leicester before Liverpool visit Valley Parade.</p> <p>In addition, a smouldering sense of injustice at the manner of this defeat may provide the extra spur Wimbledon need. </p> <p>Shortly before half-time they fell behind to the sort of home-town penalty which suggested the contest had been promoted by Don King. Early in the second half Bradford scored again, admittedly following a bad goalkeeping error by Neil Sullivan but with Wimbledon convinced that they should have had a free-kick for handball.</p> <p>In the ensuing shemozzle John Hartson was sent off by Jeff Winter for foul and abusive language, and although Wimbledon still looked the superior side, even with 10 men, slack defending helped Bradford put the match beyond their reach.</p> <p>This was Wimbledon's eighth successive league defeat. To a large extent they have dug the deepening hole in which they find themselves. Yet their approach to this game was much more like the Wimbledon of old with an emphasis on working the ball swiftly down the flanks, peppering the opposing goalmouth with swift, accurate crosses and forcing a dozen corners to Bradford's three.</p> <p>As Bradford found themselves reduced to deep, desperate defence, clearing the ball to nowhere in particular and inviting Wimbledon to come straight back at them, Valley Parade sensed that even the side lying 17th might carry too much know-how. </p> <p>Wimbledon should have gone ahead after 19 minutes when Matt Clarke failed to reach a corner from Michael Hughes and the ball fell to Jason Euell, who with all the goal to aim at lifted his shot high. On the half-hour Clarke again missed a corner and again the chance fell to Euell, who this time failed to make proper contact.</p> <p>Bradford's first significant opportunity did not arrive until nine minutes before half-time when Dean Saunders, exploiting a lucky ricochet off the referee, outpaced the Wimbledon defence only to see Sullivan deflect his shot wide.</p> <p>Then came the moment that may yet help to keep Bradford up and leave Wimbledon to contemplate life in the Nationwide League.

      "bodyText": "Bradford are still alive, Wimbledon merely livid. After dominating much of a tense, scrappy match yesterday Wimbledon went home with their Premiership status looking more precarious than ever. A bizarre sequence of events led to a Bradford win which sent Wimbledon into the bottom three for the first time this season and Paul Jewell's team moved up to a place of safety for the first time this century. Now, whatever Wimbledon do, Bradford will stay up if they win their last two games. Not that the denouement is likely to be that simple. For one thing Wimbledon have the easier fixtures: at home to an Aston Villa side with the FA Cup final on their minds followed by sleepy Southampton at the Dell. Bradford go to Leicester before Liverpool visit Valley Parade. In addition, a smouldering sense of injustice at the manner of this defeat may provide the extra spur Wimbledon need. Shortly before half-time they fell behind to the sort of home-town penalty which suggested the contest had been promoted by Don King. Early in the second half Bradford scored again, admittedly following a bad goalkeeping error by Neil Sullivan but with Wimbledon convinced that they should have had a free-kick for handball. In the ensuing shemozzle John Hartson was sent off by Jeff Winter for foul and abusive language, and although Wimbledon still looked the superior side, even with 10 men, slack defending helped Bradford put the match beyond their reach. This was Wimbledon's eighth successive league defeat. To a large extent they have dug the deepening hole in which they find themselves. Yet their approach to this game was much more like the Wimbledon of old with an emphasis on working the ball swiftly down the flanks, peppering the opposing goalmouth with swift, accurate crosses and forcing a dozen corners to Bradford's three. As Bradford found themselves reduced to deep, desperate defence, clearing the ball to nowhere in particular and inviting Wimbledon to come straight back at them, Valley Parade sensed that even the side lying 17th might carry too much know-how. Wimbledon should have gone ahead after 19 minutes when Matt Clarke failed to reach a corner from Michael Hughes and the ball fell to Jason Euell, who with all the goal to aim at lifted his shot high. On the half-hour Clarke again missed a corner and again the chance fell to Euell, who this time failed to make proper contact. Bradford's first significant opportunity did not arrive until nine minutes before half-time when Dean Saunders, exploiting a lucky ricochet off the referee, outpaced the Wimbledon defence only to see Sullivan deflect his shot wide. Then came the moment that may yet help to keep Bradford up and leave Wimbledon to contemplate life in the Nationwide League. As Ben Thatcher went to block Saunders the striker volleyed the ball against the defender and appealed for a corner. But on the say-so of a linesman, Ralph Bone from Orpington, the referee awarded Bradford a penalty from which Peter Beagrie scored. Television replays showed that the ball had struck Thatcher on the upper arm from a distance of mere inches and that the defender, trying to keep his hands out of the way, had adopted a pose akin to the Venus de Milo. Wimbledon, therefore, were entitled to grumble, although it was a combination of indiscipline and incompetence which led to Bradford's second goal. Wayne Jacobs did appear to handle the ball before releasing Beagrie, who turned inside a defender before seeing his low, bouncing shot beat Sullivan too easily for the goalkeeper's peace of mind. But as Terry Burton, Wimbledon's assistant manager, remarked later : \"No matter how bad the decision you have to keep playing, and our players should have played on.\" Not so Hartson, who was immediately dismissed for the bad-mouthing the other linesman. \"I'm sorry to get sent off but I can't help what I am,\" Hartson explained. \"I went across to the linesman to tell him it was a disgrace. Two scandalous decisions like that could cost us our Premier League status.\" It could be argued that the bigger scandal was Hartson's behaviour since his presence was vital to Wimbledon's hopes of saving the game. As it was, their last chance disappeared seven minutes from the end when Dean Windass beat first Thatcher and then the advancing Sullivan before scoring a goal that was preventable from a tight angle.",

Brian Deane sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from the penalty spot. \"It was a good move and worthy of winning a game,\" said Boro's happy manager Bryan Robson, who has \u00a320m to invest on \"four players of Christian Ziege's class\" in the summer and spent time in France last week looking for a striker. Harry Redknapp was equally sanguine despite the defeat, pleased at the prospect of a third consecutive finish in the top half of the table but concerned about having to raise \u00a34m to buy his own French forward, Kanoute. \"I thought [Marc Vivien] Foe was the best player on the pitch,\" he said. \"He's strong, powerful and he's getting better every week. But I need another forward and I want Kanoute. \"You shouldn't have to sell good players at 24 years of age and I don't really want to sell Foe, but I want Kanoute and something may have to give.\"",

The pecking order of Yorkshire football was emphatically brought home yesterday and the fall-out leaves Wednesday needing a snooker or two in their seemingly hopeless pursuit of survival. Another demoralising nul point, coupled with Bradford seizing the moment against Wimbledon, casts Hillsborough's sorry occupants six points adrift with an inferior goal difference and the clock ticking down. To stand any chance of defying the prophets of gloom they must realistically take seven, if not nine points from their remaining three games. However, trips to Coventry and Arsenal, both of whom boast formidable home records, before the curtain comes down against Leicester City, hardly inspire unbridled optimism for a side that cannot go much longer teetering on the precipice. As the whiff of relegation descended over a sparsely-populated Hillsborough the thought occurred that any side that musters 30 goals from 35 league games - the worst record in all four divisions - can hardly bristle with a smouldering sense of injustice at their impending fate.

      "body": "<p>Title-race intrigue having long since evaporated, Arsenal gained an important advantage in the contest for second place and the automatic passage it provides into the Champions League. </p> <p>Ten successive victories in all competitions, a characteristic late-season Arsenal surge, signals Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side as the undoubted form team of the moment, as their comprehensive win over an Everton side beaten at home only once in more than a year indicated. </p> <p>There is a hunger and eagerness about Arsenal which was manifested at Goodison in an absorbing, often brutal, contest between Martin Keown and Mark Hughes which should have carried with it a parental-discretion advisory, and in the energy and steel the Gunners showed in midfield. </p> <p>So emphatic was this victory that it begged the question of how a Manchester United side arguably inferior to last season's, and certainly no better, can have built a 19-point advantage over Arsenal and the chasing pack. </p> <p>Wenger argued, without much conviction, that the close title contests of the previous two campaigns were a truer indication of the standings of the Premiership's leading teams, then remounted his current hobbyhorse that United's non-involvement in the FA Cup set them up for their record-breaking league success. It is a moot point, but the fact remains that for Arsenal a season which until fairly recently looked like fizzling out may now conclude with victory in the Uefa Cup final and a runners-up place in the league. </p> <p>\"It is very important to finish second,\" said Wenger. \"It would put us straight into the Champions League, which is vital. After winning the championship, second is the best possible position and you could see that from the way we played against Everton. We will fight for that position until the last second of the season.\" </p> <p>It is a rallying cry which has been adopted by Wenger's side, who now stand four wins shy of the 12-year-old club record of 14 consecutive victories. </p> <p>Without the injured Thierry Henry, their leading scorer, and with Patrick Vieira limited to a late substitute appearance because of his own fitness problem, Emmanuel Petit was redoubtable in midfield and Marc Overmars unstoppable in attack, his goal the result of a committed run and fine finish from Dennis Bergkamp's intelligent pass. And then, of course, there is the back four. </p> <p>How perverse that whereas United's defensive shortcomings were their Achilles heel in Europe this year, Arsenal's back line shows few, if any, signs of losing its grip, as a 10-goal edge over United in the goals-against column testifies. </p> <p>Wenger certainly believes that Keown and Tony Adams, both 33, and David Seaman, 36, should form the cornerstone of Kevin Keegan's England team this summer, as they will Arsenal's European campaign next season. </p> <p>\"Martin and Tony had outstanding games and if I were English I would be confident if all three were playing for the national team,\" said Wenger. \"They read the game so well, they know each other well and when you look at the best defenders all over Europe they are over 30. I believe they are the best English pairing and having them around is a huge advantage because in international competition sometimes not conceding a goal is one step better than scoring one. </p> <p>\"Age played against age out there and it was a huge battle between Keown and Hughes. The older they get the tougher they get and it was a match within a match especially in the first half. I was almost scared; I thought one of them might lose their nerve.\" </p> <p>All Keown and Adams have to ensure is that Arsenal hold their nerve for the remaining four games of the season.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Title-race intrigue having long since evaporated, Arsenal gained an important advantage in the contest for second place and the automatic passage it provides into the Champions League. Ten successive victories in all competitions, a characteristic late-season Arsenal surge, signals Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side as the undoubted form team of the moment, as their comprehensive win over an Everton side beaten at home only once in more than a year indicated. There is a hunger and eagerness about Arsenal which was manifested at Goodison in an absorbing, often brutal, contest between Martin Keown and Mark Hughes which should have carried with it a parental-discretion advisory, and in the energy and steel the Gunners showed in midfield. So emphatic was this victory that it begged the question of how a Manchester United side arguably inferior to last season's, and certainly no better, can have built a 19-point advantage over Arsenal and the chasing pack. Wenger argued, without much conviction, that the close title contests of the previous two campaigns were a truer indication of the standings of the Premiership's leading teams, then remounted his current hobbyhorse that United's non-involvement in the FA Cup set them up for their record-breaking league success. It is a moot point, but the fact remains that for Arsenal a season which until fairly recently looked like fizzling out may now conclude with victory in the Uefa Cup final and a runners-up place in the league. \"It is very important to finish second,\" said Wenger. \"It would put us straight into the Champions League, which is vital. After winning the championship, second is the best possible position and you could see that from the way we played against Everton. We will fight for that position until the last second of the season.\" It is a rallying cry which has been adopted by Wenger's side, who now stand four wins shy of the 12-year-old club record of 14 consecutive victories. Without the injured Thierry Henry, their leading scorer, and with Patrick Vieira limited to a late substitute appearance because of his own fitness problem, Emmanuel Petit was redoubtable in midfield and Marc Overmars unstoppable in attack, his goal the result of a committed run and fine finish from Dennis Bergkamp's intelligent pass. And then, of course, there is the back four. How perverse that whereas United's defensive shortcomings were their Achilles heel in Europe this year, Arsenal's back line shows few, if any, signs of losing its grip, as a 10-goal edge over United in the goals-against column testifies. Wenger certainly believes that Keown and Tony Adams, both 33, and David Seaman, 36, should form the cornerstone of Kevin Keegan's England team this summer, as they will Arsenal's European campaign next season. \"Martin and Tony had outstanding games and if I were English I would be confident if all three were playing for the national team,\" said Wenger. \"They read the game so well, they know each other well and when you look at the best defenders all over Europe they are over 30. I believe they are the best English pairing and having them around is a huge advantage because in international competition sometimes not conceding a goal is one step better than scoring one. \"Age played against age out there and it was a huge battle between Keown and Hughes. The older they get the tougher they get and it was a match within a match especially in the first half. I was almost scared; I thought one of them might lose their nerve.\" All Keown and Adams have to ensure is that Arsenal hold their nerve for the remaining four games of the season.",

      "bodyText": "Wimbledon boss Egil Olsen paid the price for losing the respect of his players and failing to halt the club's dramatic dive into the Premiership relegation zone as he was sacked with just two games of the season left. Assistant boss Terry Burton, who was only promoted from being academy director towards the end of last month, will replace him for those last two matches of the campaign in a desperate bid to avoid the drop. The club's Norwegian owners insisted the move was not fuelled by panic and indeed was not due to the constant and almost unprecedented criticism of maverick compatriot Olsen, who only took charge last summer, and his tactics by his players. However, it is clear that a crisis was descending on Wimbledon when they not only lost 3-0 away to relegation rivals Bradford to fall into the drop zone but then striker John Hartson called for a change of manager this summer. Hartson was certainly not the first Dons player to speak out this season, with Carl Cort and Michael Hughes - among others - already having made their frustrations abundantly clear. And given that Burton, former boss Joe Kinnear's number two, was apparently promoted after appeals from the squad, it is hard to resist the conclusion that player power simply became irresistible. Wimbledon only have those two games left - at home to Aston Villa and away to Southampton - in which to rescue themselves from a run of eight consecutive defeats and a crisis in confidence. Otherwise the Dons' 14-year fairytale stay in the top flight, which has encompassed a memorable 1988 FA Cup triumph against Liverpool - just 11 years after being elected from non-League football into Division Four - will come to an end. And despite the multi-million pound backing of their owners, the prospects for a team without a home of their own, with a small following and with the prospect of losing a host of star names this summer if they go down, hardly bear thinking about. Chairman Bjarne Rune Gjelsten, who had a lengthy meeting with Olsen this morning in the wake of the 3-0 defeat at Bradford, simply declared: \"Relegation is not an option.\" As he then attempted to expand upon his decision to axe Olsen, there was a sense of desperation in the air at the club's training ground as well as a feeling that too little may have been done too late. But Gjelsten, who rather predictably and lamely blamed the media for the current pressure on the Dons, insisted: \"I had a long talk with Egil Olsen and we agreed that a change was needed. \"We must put Wimbledon Football Club first and put emotions aside. I am sorry to announce that Egil Olsen will be relieved of his post with immediate effect, but he was hired for the right reasons. \"The bottom line is results. You win no points for style.

The Tory leader, making his most outspoken comments on the issue ahead of Thursday's local elections, immediately drew accusations from Jack Straw, the home secretary, of \"pandering\" to the extreme right. Mr Straw, who is considering whether to ban a National Front march planned in Worcester on May 6, charged Mr Hague with feeding \"anxieties which can lead to extremism\" by \"gross exaggeration\" of the asylum situation. The home secretary's attack echoed strong criticism from the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, who accused the Conservative leader of behaving like a \"saloon bar politician\" and lowering the tone of British politics. Mr Hague's comments, made four days before voters around the country go to the polls in town hall elections, underline his belief that his strategy of seizing on high-profile causes such as asylum or householders' right to self-defence is gaining his party electoral ground. Party insiders believe proposals to lock up asylum seekers in \"reception centres\" have played well with most voters. The Tory leader will push the race debate still further soon in a speech to the Police Federation, where he will warn that police officers should spend less time on \"politically correct race awareness courses\" and more time fighting crime.

One person was arrested as around 30 supporters tried to defy the ban. Earlier in April, five people were arrested during a 50-strong NF march in Margate, Kent, organised in protest at the number of asylum seekers accommodated in the seaside town. Yesterday's exchanges indicate that Mr Hague is unrepentant over his party's decision to make asylum a political issue. After an audience member on the Dimbleby programme, herself from an ethnic minority, appealed to him to soften his rhetoric, arguing that words such as \"flooding and swamping\" made her feel intimidated, the Tory leader refused, saying: \"We should use words properly with their full meaning and their true meaning.

Mr Straw, whose strategy has been to leave the Tories little ground on asylum by taking a tough approach, yesterday clung firmly to the moral high ground as he directed his most impassioned criticism to date at the Tory leader. Claiming Mr Hague's comments showed up the \"dangers of weak leadership\", he said: \"Pushed to the right by forces in his own party, he now justifies his stand by claiming that otherwise support for even more extreme views would grow - but pandering to the National Front and other such groups is no way to oppose them. \"Mr Hague has fed the anxieties which can lead to extremism by grossly exaggerating the position on asylum and by irresponsibly opposing our sensible measures like the new civil penalty on hauliers.\" The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, also rejected Mr Hague's remarks. \"The number of asylum seekers coming in is going down, not up,\" he said. \"It's not up to Britain as to how many asylum seekers there are; it reflects the situation in the rest of the world.\" Last month Mr Hughes reported both the Conservatives and Labour to the commission for racial equality, prompting a commission warning to both parties.

Confidence was certainly fragile. But Greenspan could have acted more promptly to tighten credit conditions once the danger of depression had passed. Now, he appears to be playing catch-up with the markets rather than staying, as all central bankers should, ahead of the game. </p> <p>So what can he do to ensure a soft landing for the US economy?

The price of Greenspan's success in preventing disaster is that it has become natural for naive investors to think that share prices cannot collapse or that, if they do, investors will somehow be insulated. </p> <p>In particular, the Fed's rescue of LTCM - \"well-connected financial speculators\" deemed too big to fail - has fostered socially destructive illusions among investors. Such illusions could lead to the federal government being forced to provide a safety net for millions of ordinary stock market investors who would be deemed too small to fail. </p> <p>Hu argues that we are now in a world where Greenspan's presence means disasters simply do not happen. He says investor optimism needs to be tempered with genuine fear that crashes, while ex tremely rare, can still happen and that the Fed may not ride to the rescue. </p> <p>Since Greenspan's famous \"irrational exuberance\" speech in December 1996 the Dow has climbed more than 60%. Having failed to \"jawbone down\" the market, the Fed should now declare that it will not provide liquidity for mutual funds which run into redemption problems. This would force investors to re-think the existence of a federal safety net. </p> <p>Secondly, Hu suggests that the Fed should forswear intervening directly in equities or equity derivatives. By ruling out intervention, the Fed would force investors to re-do their sums to take account of the extra risk involved in piling into equities. </p> <p>Such a reassessment is clearly needed. Although recent wobbles indicate that the market may have entered a new bear phase, valuations are still stretched. Martin reckons that trend growth of the US economy would have to be close to 10% and inflation zero to justify Wall Street's current level. </p> <p>Greenspan's reputation is still high. His achievements have earned a place on the cover of Time; a Thai newspaper characterised him as a demi-god in the aftermath of the Asian crisis; he has an unofficial fan club on the web - GetExhuberant.com. </p> <p>He is arguably the world's second most powerful person, and is watched closely for clues to his thinking. His status is truly superhuman. But even HIS powers may not be enough to get him out of the mess he is now in - one that he has in part created.</p>",

Such illusions could lead to the federal government being forced to provide a safety net for millions of ordinary stock market investors who would be deemed too small to fail. Hu argues that we are now in a world where Greenspan's presence means disasters simply do not happen. He says investor optimism needs to be tempered with genuine fear that crashes, while ex tremely rare, can still happen and that the Fed may not ride to the rescue. Since Greenspan's famous \"irrational exuberance\" speech in December 1996 the Dow has climbed more than 60%. Having failed to \"jawbone down\" the market, the Fed should now declare that it will not provide liquidity for mutual funds which run into redemption problems. This would force investors to re-think the existence of a federal safety net. Secondly, Hu suggests that the Fed should forswear intervening directly in equities or equity derivatives. By ruling out intervention, the Fed would force investors to re-do their sums to take account of the extra risk involved in piling into equities. Such a reassessment is clearly needed. Although recent wobbles indicate that the market may have entered a new bear phase, valuations are still stretched. Martin reckons that trend growth of the US economy would have to be close to 10% and inflation zero to justify Wall Street's current level. Greenspan's reputation is still high. His achievements have earned a place on the cover of Time; a Thai newspaper characterised him as a demi-god in the aftermath of the Asian crisis; he has an unofficial fan club on the web - GetExhuberant.com. He is arguably the world's second most powerful person, and is watched closely for clues to his thinking. His status is truly superhuman. But even HIS powers may not be enough to get him out of the mess he is now in - one that he has in part created.",

Since being formed in 1996, TheStreet.com had attracted some top talent and about 100,000 subscribers. Earlier this year, it launched a UK website.

      "body": "<p>In case the Scotsman's detractors haven't got the message, its publisher is overjoyed by the upheaval of the past couple of months. Recalling the Wapping siege of 1986, Andrew Neil says: \"If 5,000 print workers can't beat me, then this bunch of amateurs have no chance.\" </p> <p>By amateurs, he mainly means the paper's media rivals, along with recently departed staff and the chattering classes. Neil has always attracted enemies and it doesn't seem to disturb him. \"I know they'd love me to fall flat on my face,\" he says. He has always thrived on adversity and it's no surprise that he should evoke the memory of his early years as editor of the Sunday Times. </p> <p>Then, he felt himself surrounded by a stuffy establishment and was relieved when many of those who he most distrusted refused to make the move to Wapping. He says: \"Famous names left, and people forecast doom. It didn't happen.\" Shrugging aside their complaints, he created a paper in his own image and, significantly, reversed the downward sales trend. One major difference between the situation at the Sunday Times then and the Scotsman now is that Neil was the architect of the move to Wapping. He controlled the circumstances. This time he doesn't but, apparently, it makes no difference. </p> <p>Since the dismissal of Alan Ruddock at the beginning of February, a raft of senior staff have jumped ship, or been ordered to walk the plank. So where's the benefit? \"The dead wood has gone,\" says Neil. \"We're glad to see the back of most of them so that we can bring in a new team and unlock the young talent that we already have.\" </p> <p>He returns time and again to this theme, a mixture of positive spin and his natural swagger. The departed staff, he says, are \"carthorses replaced by frisky young stallions and mares, lots of mares\". Top mare is Rebecca Hardy, the deputy editor pitched into the hot seat when Neil's recently appointed editor, Tim Luckhurst, was ordered to take a month's rest by his doctor.

      "bodyText": "In case the Scotsman's detractors haven't got the message, its publisher is overjoyed by the upheaval of the past couple of months. Recalling the Wapping siege of 1986, Andrew Neil says: \"If 5,000 print workers can't beat me, then this bunch of amateurs have no chance.\" By amateurs, he mainly means the paper's media rivals, along with recently departed staff and the chattering classes. Neil has always attracted enemies and it doesn't seem to disturb him. \"I know they'd love me to fall flat on my face,\" he says. He has always thrived on adversity and it's no surprise that he should evoke the memory of his early years as editor of the Sunday Times. Then, he felt himself surrounded by a stuffy establishment and was relieved when many of those who he most distrusted refused to make the move to Wapping. He says: \"Famous names left, and people forecast doom. It didn't happen.\" Shrugging aside their complaints, he created a paper in his own image and, significantly, reversed the downward sales trend. One major difference between the situation at the Sunday Times then and the Scotsman now is that Neil was the architect of the move to Wapping. He controlled the circumstances. This time he doesn't but, apparently, it makes no difference. Since the dismissal of Alan Ruddock at the beginning of February, a raft of senior staff have jumped ship, or been ordered to walk the plank. So where's the benefit? \"The dead wood has gone,\" says Neil. \"We're glad to see the back of most of them so that we can bring in a new team and unlock the young talent that we already have.\" He returns time and again to this theme, a mixture of positive spin and his natural swagger. The departed staff, he says, are \"carthorses replaced by frisky young stallions and mares, lots of mares\". Top mare is Rebecca Hardy, the deputy editor pitched into the hot seat when Neil's recently appointed editor, Tim Luckhurst, was ordered to take a month's rest by his doctor. She will oversee the changes in the paper to be unveiled to readers on May 8, but exclusively previewed in the dummies shown here. As with the recent changes to the Times, the Guardian has again been the template: a broadsheet main section is complemented by a tabloid-sized section, entitled S2, containing features, health, lifestyle, arts and women's pages. Neil says the advantage of this arrangement is that older, current readers need not be alarmed because the main section will continue to cover politics, home and foreign news as before. But he hopes to attract younger readers - especially those who have strayed to the Scottish editions of London-based papers - with the better coverage of lighter fare.

The heavy doors swung open and I sunk into the generous blond leather seats. The engine throbbed as he had to lean over and help me put on the old- fashioned seatbelt whose design I had never seen before. By the time he dropped me home that night I was smitten by the big, generous man and his big fat car. </p> <p>A couple of weeks after that, my sister looked after my son and we went away together on a walking holiday in the Brecon Beacons - except that we didn't do any walking. Instead we sat in the comfortable interior of the Rover and looked at the hills and the rain and talked, ate sweets that we had bought from the service stations along the M4 (in a classic car you have to stop and fill up frequently) and er, consummated our relationship. It was the best weekend away I had ever had. </p> <p>That was seven years ago. We got married, bought a house and had another child. We have a sensible family car that we use for everyday purposes. The Rover is still used for important motoring experiences - for trips away or to make an entrance at a wedding or a party. 0ur children love it and when we all went on holiday to Italy there was none of the usual claustrophobia, car-sickness or \"How long until we get there?\" nagging. They are proud of the admiring stares the Rover gets as it hums majestically along the road and it makes going on long trips an expensive but pleasurable experience. </p> <p>A couple of weeks ago Dan suddenly announced that he was going to put it up for sale. My son burst into tears and my husband explained that the car needed some work on it that he didn't have the time or money to carry out and that it made him feel guilty that we don't use it enough. He wanted to sell it to someone who would give it all the attention it deserved. A single man, perhaps, like he had been 10 years before when he bought it off his next door neighbour. </p> <p>I have never been able to bring myself to nag Dan about the Rover. While my sister insisted that her partner got rid of his old 70s gangster Jaguar because it seemed a luxury and could never be a practical family car, I knew that the Rover was part of the deal when we got together. He has always told me that it is worth a fortune and that we could sell it if we needed money. I nodded, thinking he was part of the Eddie Grundy school of finance, but basically ignored him because I knew that it was an asset that could never be realised. There is just too much personal history and emotion attached to his beautiful old banger. </p> <p>If he has to sell it I worry about the effect on his psyche. I can't help wondering if part of his personality will go along with the sale of the car, if his largess and spontaneity will just shrivel up and disappear. The Rover is like his signature. His friends say things like \"Saw you were in Kentish Town today\" because they know it is him in that curvy blue car. </p> <p>I may associate the Rover with our courtship but he has other important memories that were before my time. In Marseilles some gangsters started shooting from a speeding car at the garage owner who was selling Dan a new tyre and they both found refuge on the cosily carpeted floor of the Rover. A river bursts its banks in Dorset and the strength of the engine stopped him being swept away by the water and he simply drove through the deluge. These are the times the Rover saved his life but the most important memory of good times in the Rover is when Dan drove his late father through France. </p> <p>He had never allowed Dan to drive him before - in fact he had never really allowed anyone to drive him before and Dan felt that it was not only a sign that he regarded Dan as a man at last but that he trusted and admired the reliability and comfort of the Rover. I suppose Dan must have driven other women in it too but I can't bear to think about anyone else testing just how far the passenger seat can tip backwards, thank you very much. </p> <p>Car owners are perfectly capable of having strong emotions about cars that do not have the obvious appeal of a classic like Dan's Rover, which has the ability to inspire feelings of nostalgia even from those born long after it was made. Adam Richards, 25, owns a Peugeot 309 that most people would have great difficulty mustering up any sentimental attachment for. </p> <p>\"I know that she looks totally ordinary but this used to be my family car. My parents gave me it a couple of years ago. It has probably hindered rather then helped my love life and yet I have such good memories of going on family trips with my parents and my sister. It would seem immensely disloyal to my parents who saved up to buy it and kept it going in such good condition to ever sell it. It would mean nothing to someone else but for me it has come to symbolise the later part of my childhood.\" </p> <p>Gemma and David Ackerman feel that they will never be able to sell the BMW 5 series that they bought in the late 80s even though they don't feel it reflects the kind of people they are now. \"We both worked in the financial sector when we met but now I am a teacher and David retrained as a doctor. We don't really like anything about the car except the fact that my waters broke all over the back seats when I was in labour with my first son Joseph. Because of that the car must belong to us and we belong to the car. It has transcended its function as a motor vehicle and because of this one little incident has become a deeply personal object.\" </p> <p>So is it ever worth selling a car whose price can hardly reflect its emotional value? \"Yes,\" says Dan, who is selling the Rover for \u00a31,200, \"but only if you love the car enough to let it go. It is a car that makes things happen and owning it has been a real adventure. So much has happened in that car. Anyone who buys it will not only be buying a beautiful machine but a piece of motoring history. The closure of Longbridge makes it even more poignant. If I feel that the buyer understands all this then the pain of seeing it drive away for good will be made much easier.\" Is there anyone out there?</p>",

Not since the 80s has Honda offered something smaller than the Civic for UK drivers. As a result, the Japanese maker believes it's been neglecting the girls. (Ironic then that out of around 40 journalists assembled to test it, I counted zero women.) </p> <p>The Logo is more stalking horse than prime candidate. Groomed to test European taste, it's a close rework of the same Logo that's been running around Japan for a few years. Its job is to smooth the road ahead for the successor, a Swindon-built mini scheduled for 2002. </p> <p>In its league, the Logo comes up against the Polo, Clio and Peugeot 206. It has some good points: visibility is fine - the seating position, perhaps with women in mind, is pronounced. The car has nice, deep windows and the cabin is well lit. The engine (aluminium, 1.3) could provide more power and has no fizz after 60mph, but it feels like a quality job and is reasonably smooth (I'd like to see a rev counter, but that's a bloke thing). </p> <p>But it's painfully bland. There are options that add an extra ripple of plastic to the front spoiler and rear roofline, but any attempt to beef up the Logo is like adding a red stripe to your wheelbarrow. It's so dull, it's invisible. Then you start to notice other styling goosebumps: the window frame on my driver's door was welded to the body with what looked like pie crust; the gearstick is like a liquorice pipe-cleaner and, from the pavement, you can gawp through the rear wheel arch and see the skinny exhaust. </p> <p>This is wonderful news for Honda: when the Logo replacement arrives, it can't fail to be less drab. For now though, the price (\u00a39,495) tends to put the premium rivals into perspective. What would you rather spend: \u00a313,500 on a space-age Audi A2, or just less than \u00a310,000 on a not-so-super mini? </p> <p>Next to the Logo, Honda also has something far more palatable in the launch cupboard: a five-door version of the small HR-V offroader. Until now, you could get only a three-doored HR-V, but the car's sold so well to young drivers in search of quirkiness that Honda wanted to keep pace - in case they all settle down and breed. </p> <p>For kicking sand, the HR-V was a great set of wheels, but its short undercarriage made it Mr Fidget on the motorway. By adding 10 centimetes to the length, you're not only able to have two more doors, you also get a machine that sits as it should in high-speed traffic. Now with more mature road manners, the car still has the same volume of bag space, including clever cargo hooks and underfloor storage sections. For added zip, there's now a 124bhp 1.6 engine, instead of the 103bhp. </p> <p>Honda admits the HR-V is \"not designed as a serious offroader\". As with the bigger CR-V, the drive engages all four tyres only when it is needed - most of the time, you're in front-wheel drive mode. </p> <p>While no major news event, the stretched HR-V is a worthy improvement. The car also has a certain urbane charm that the owners of Suzuki's Vitara, Daihatsu's Terios and other hairdressery can only dream about. Unlike the Logo, it shows the middle ground doesn't have to be dead flat. </p> <p><strong> Logo HR-V 5 door</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Top speed</strong> 94mph 106mph </p> <p><strong> 0-62mph</strong> 14.5 secs 11.3 secs </p> <p><strong> Engine</strong> 1343cc 1590cc </p> <p><strong> On the stereo</strong> Steps Beach Boys </p> <p><strong> For</strong> Um . . .

The engine (aluminium, 1.3) could provide more power and has no fizz after 60mph, but it feels like a quality job and is reasonably smooth (I'd like to see a rev counter, but that's a bloke thing). But it's painfully bland. There are options that add an extra ripple of plastic to the front spoiler and rear roofline, but any attempt to beef up the Logo is like adding a red stripe to your wheelbarrow. It's so dull, it's invisible. Then you start to notice other styling goosebumps: the window frame on my driver's door was welded to the body with what looked like pie crust; the gearstick is like a liquorice pipe-cleaner and, from the pavement, you can gawp through the rear wheel arch and see the skinny exhaust. This is wonderful news for Honda: when the Logo replacement arrives, it can't fail to be less drab. For now though, the price (\u00a39,495) tends to put the premium rivals into perspective. What would you rather spend: \u00a313,500 on a space-age Audi A2, or just less than \u00a310,000 on a not-so-super mini? Next to the Logo, Honda also has something far more palatable in the launch cupboard: a five-door version of the small HR-V offroader. Until now, you could get only a three-doored HR-V, but the car's sold so well to young drivers in search of quirkiness that Honda wanted to keep pace - in case they all settle down and breed. For kicking sand, the HR-V was a great set of wheels, but its short undercarriage made it Mr Fidget on the motorway. By adding 10 centimetes to the length, you're not only able to have two more doors, you also get a machine that sits as it should in high-speed traffic. Now with more mature road manners, the car still has the same volume of bag space, including clever cargo hooks and underfloor storage sections. For added zip, there's now a 124bhp 1.6 engine, instead of the 103bhp. Honda admits the HR-V is \"not designed as a serious offroader\". As with the bigger CR-V, the drive engages all four tyres only when it is needed - most of the time, you're in front-wheel drive mode. While no major news event, the stretched HR-V is a worthy improvement. The car also has a certain urbane charm that the owners of Suzuki's Vitara, Daihatsu's Terios and other hairdressery can only dream about. Unlike the Logo, it shows the middle ground doesn't have to be dead flat.

For those staff who remain, led by former Daily Mail showbiz writer Rebecca Hardy, it is a period of unprecedented instability. </p> <p>Yet, if that wasn't excitement enough, the Scotsman's rival in Glasgow is also undergoing a period of change, albeit at a rather more sedate pace. The Herald's editor Harry Reid is to step down, as the paper begins a gradual repositioning of its brand. And throwing the whole arena into confusion is the imminent launch of Scotland's first new national newspaper in over a century, backed by Bonnier - a Swedish media group whose name is almost unknown in Britain, but whose foray into Scotland could just signal a transformation in the entire British newspaper market. Anyone who still labours under the impression that the Scottish newspaper scene is not worth a second look is seriously deluded. </p> <p>It is easy to focus on the troubles at the Scotsman at a time of such turmoil. Andrew Neil, the paper's publisher, is a convenient hate figure and has been (rightly, in the view of many observers) blamed for the Scotsman's woes. Its editorial stance has shifted radically from being a staunch supporter of devolution to Scotland's sceptic-in-chief. Teachers, social workers and other assorted lefties have felt the sharp end of the editorial pen. The trouble is, these assorted lefties make up the core of the its readership. </p> <p>But while Neil-baiting is good clean fun - and patient readers will be rewarded with more soon - the development in Scotland which has the potential for far more impact on the rest of the UK media industry is the investment by Bonnier in the Scottish newspaper market. For the past two years, it has been conducting extensive research into the viability of a niche-market business and political daily newspaper aimed at the Scottish elite. Now, plans are well advanced for a new title, provisionally called Scottish Business, possibly to launch later this year. It should come as no surprise that many of the key staff at the new venture have been recruited from the Scotsman. Its editor, John Penman, is a former Scotsman political editor; his deputy, Richard Neville, quit his post as joint deputy editor at Holyrood Road a few weeks ago; a number of other former Scotsman staffers are now on the Penman payroll. </p> <p>All, he says, have joined not because they were desperate to escape the clutches of Neil, but because they were genuinely excited by the new venture. \"Nothing like this has ever been tried in Britain before,\" he enthuses. </p> <p>As the bigger newspaper groups go global, Bonnier has identified a potential niche readership in Scotland of 600,000. Of course, circulation will be nothing like that: most observers reckon the new venture would be doing well if it topped 30,000. So how could it possibly survive? Penman insists that to write it off now demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of niche market potential: \"We have got a very defined target market, and we know our readers extremely well. We will give our readers exactly what they want.\" </p> <p>Such a tight readership base is attractive to advertisers seeking out a particular market. At the moment, because Scotland's newspaper scene is predominantly city-based, high-quality advertisers have to split their budgets between the Herald and the Scotsman, and possibly even Aberdeen's Press and Journal and the Dundee Courier as well. \"We will give them one place to go,\" says Penman. </p> <p>He says Bonnier knows what it is doing - it has an impressive track record in similar ventures around Europe. \"They are not philanthropists, they are in it to make money.\" And if it works north of the border, the group has indicated it has its eyes set on England. Other proprietors should be worried by the upstart snapping at their heels. </p> <p>Back in Scotland, Penman is keen to distance his paper from the instability elsewhere in the market. The Scotsman's impending relaunch and expected three-month price cut from 45p to 20p will have no effect, he insists. While the Scotsman pursues the Mail and even Daily Record readers, the new journal is seeking out an entirely new market. \"What happens with the Scotsman will have no impact on our plans.\" </p> <p>That is not, however, how others see it. \"All eyes are on the Scotsman,\" says one Scottish newspaper editor. \"If a price cut gets the Scotsman back up the circulation ladder, it is hard to see how the new paper can get a toehold as well. The Scottish newspaper market is so fierce.\" </p> <p>However much Penman protests, it is clear that what happens at the Scotsman over the next few months is critical - and the problems at Scotland's national newspaper can not be underestimated. The exodus of staff has been of biblical proportions. And while Neil insists on these pages that he is glad to see the back of most of them, it should be pointed out that the departing hacks are not exactly members of a Scotsman establishment - that band all went three or four years ago during the reign of Martin Clarke. </p> <p>Many say that Neil's problem is that he constantly appears to need an enemy against which to rail. What he fails to realise, says one recently departed senior staff member, is that the Scotsman had the youngest, most dynamic staff in Scottish newspapers. The abrupt sacking of the respected successor to Clarke, Alan Ruddock, and the stringent budget cuts in the last months of his reign, shook the core. \"There was an incredible amount of goodwill. But when you start turning the screws on the staff, and alienating readers at the same time, things start to go wrong.\" </p> <p>Neil's immediate challenge is to beef up the top echelons of the Scotsman hierarchy. The departure of Neville, and that of production editor Nigel Donaldson - a Scotsman veteran of 22 years and the man responsible for getting the paper out on time every night - were severe blows. Hardy, now in the acting editor chair after being parachuted in by Neil's resident consultant Sue Douglas to oversee the launch of the tabloid features section, has been shored up with a couple of key appointments. Terry Watson, experienced in production at the Scotsman, has been made acting deputy editor and Tom Little, former Glasgow bureau chief, is now assistant editor, news. And Jeff Randall, the editor of the Scotsman's sister paper Sunday Business, has agreed a flying visit as a safe pair of hands to oversee the business coverage in the Scotsman relaunch. In the longer term, if Luckhurst does not return from sick leave (and he is, contrary to unkind rumours, seriously ill) it is rumoured that Neil is seeking north and south of the border for a Scottish intellectual heavyweight to run the paper. </p> <p>In the short term, the Scotsman will undoubtedly gain a swell of readers over a summer of price-cutting - perhaps clearing the ever-elusive 100,000 barrier. But to retain them it will have to get itself a clear editorial strategy. However much Neil hates them personally, the Scotsman must learn to love its leftie readers. </p> <p>Matt Wells is a former Scotsman journalist</p>",

And throwing the whole arena into confusion is the imminent launch of Scotland's first new national newspaper in over a century, backed by Bonnier - a Swedish media group whose name is almost unknown in Britain, but whose foray into Scotland could just signal a transformation in the entire British newspaper market. Anyone who still labours under the impression that the Scottish newspaper scene is not worth a second look is seriously deluded. It is easy to focus on the troubles at the Scotsman at a time of such turmoil. Andrew Neil, the paper's publisher, is a convenient hate figure and has been (rightly, in the view of many observers) blamed for the Scotsman's woes. Its editorial stance has shifted radically from being a staunch supporter of devolution to Scotland's sceptic-in-chief. Teachers, social workers and other assorted lefties have felt the sharp end of the editorial pen. The trouble is, these assorted lefties make up the core of the its readership. But while Neil-baiting is good clean fun - and patient readers will be rewarded with more soon - the development in Scotland which has the potential for far more impact on the rest of the UK media industry is the investment by Bonnier in the Scottish newspaper market. For the past two years, it has been conducting extensive research into the viability of a niche-market business and political daily newspaper aimed at the Scottish elite. Now, plans are well advanced for a new title, provisionally called Scottish Business, possibly to launch later this year. It should come as no surprise that many of the key staff at the new venture have been recruited from the Scotsman. Its editor, John Penman, is a former Scotsman political editor; his deputy, Richard Neville, quit his post as joint deputy editor at Holyrood Road a few weeks ago; a number of other former Scotsman staffers are now on the Penman payroll. All, he says, have joined not because they were desperate to escape the clutches of Neil, but because they were genuinely excited by the new venture. \"Nothing like this has ever been tried in Britain before,\" he enthuses. As the bigger newspaper groups go global, Bonnier has identified a potential niche readership in Scotland of 600,000. Of course, circulation will be nothing like that: most observers reckon the new venture would be doing well if it topped 30,000. So how could it possibly survive? Penman insists that to write it off now demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of niche market potential: \"We have got a very defined target market, and we know our readers extremely well. We will give our readers exactly what they want.\" Such a tight readership base is attractive to advertisers seeking out a particular market. At the moment, because Scotland's newspaper scene is predominantly city-based, high-quality advertisers have to split their budgets between the Herald and the Scotsman, and possibly even Aberdeen's Press and Journal and the Dundee Courier as well. \"We will give them one place to go,\" says Penman. He says Bonnier knows what it is doing - it has an impressive track record in similar ventures around Europe. \"They are not philanthropists, they are in it to make money.\" And if it works north of the border, the group has indicated it has its eyes set on England. Other proprietors should be worried by the upstart snapping at their heels. Back in Scotland, Penman is keen to distance his paper from the instability elsewhere in the market. The Scotsman's impending relaunch and expected three-month price cut from 45p to 20p will have no effect, he insists. While the Scotsman pursues the Mail and even Daily Record readers, the new journal is seeking out an entirely new market. \"What happens with the Scotsman will have no impact on our plans.\" That is not, however, how others see it. \"All eyes are on the Scotsman,\" says one Scottish newspaper editor. \"If a price cut gets the Scotsman back up the circulation ladder, it is hard to see how the new paper can get a toehold as well. The Scottish newspaper market is so fierce.\" However much Penman protests, it is clear that what happens at the Scotsman over the next few months is critical - and the problems at Scotland's national newspaper can not be underestimated. The exodus of staff has been of biblical proportions. And while Neil insists on these pages that he is glad to see the back of most of them, it should be pointed out that the departing hacks are not exactly members of a Scotsman establishment - that band all went three or four years ago during the reign of Martin Clarke. Many say that Neil's problem is that he constantly appears to need an enemy against which to rail. What he fails to realise, says one recently departed senior staff member, is that the Scotsman had the youngest, most dynamic staff in Scottish newspapers. The abrupt sacking of the respected successor to Clarke, Alan Ruddock, and the stringent budget cuts in the last months of his reign, shook the core. \"There was an incredible amount of goodwill. But when you start turning the screws on the staff, and alienating readers at the same time, things start to go wrong.\" Neil's immediate challenge is to beef up the top echelons of the Scotsman hierarchy. The departure of Neville, and that of production editor Nigel Donaldson - a Scotsman veteran of 22 years and the man responsible for getting the paper out on time every night - were severe blows. Hardy, now in the acting editor chair after being parachuted in by Neil's resident consultant Sue Douglas to oversee the launch of the tabloid features section, has been shored up with a couple of key appointments. Terry Watson, experienced in production at the Scotsman, has been made acting deputy editor and Tom Little, former Glasgow bureau chief, is now assistant editor, news. And Jeff Randall, the editor of the Scotsman's sister paper Sunday Business, has agreed a flying visit as a safe pair of hands to oversee the business coverage in the Scotsman relaunch. In the longer term, if Luckhurst does not return from sick leave (and he is, contrary to unkind rumours, seriously ill) it is rumoured that Neil is seeking north and south of the border for a Scottish intellectual heavyweight to run the paper. In the short term, the Scotsman will undoubtedly gain a swell of readers over a summer of price-cutting - perhaps clearing the ever-elusive 100,000 barrier. But to retain them it will have to get itself a clear editorial strategy. However much Neil hates them personally, the Scotsman must learn to love its leftie readers.

      "body": "<p>In April 1999, the British radical journalist Christopher Hitchens prepared to tour the United States with his latest savage but elegant screed, No One Left To Lie To: The Triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton. Fresh out of college, struggling with freelance writing stints and bored of acting gratis in underground plays, I decided to pick up a camera, take off and join him. </p> <p>I had first met \"Hitch\" in 1995 when I was an undergraduate, at a forum on Radical Journalism convened by the New Statesman. As someone who seemed scarcely to have aged in spirit since his 60s street-fighting days, Hitchens cut quite a heroic figure (as he still does) among many of the young aspirants to whom he spoke. Then, some months before his books tour, while he was a visiting lecturer at UC Berkeley's journalism school, I had visited him and struck up a distant friendship. </p> <p>When the Observer published an extract from his Clinton book, I sent him an email, discovered he was touring the US, and decided I had found the ideal subject for a film. I'd just bought a digital video camera and was vainly trying to make a documentary. But a grand tour of the major American cities, studying the stateside reaction to this very English internationalist savaging the leader of the Free World, seemed like a much better gig. </p> <p>It was with guarded admiration and affection - and the certain promise of gathering telegenic material - that I flew out on a whim to film Hitchens' sybaritic stateside book tour, as he attempted with some success to whip up an orgy of scepticism towards the president. </p> <p>I secured vague interest (but no funding) from the production company that had turned out Hitchens' last film. The Mourning After was Hitchens' essay on the hysteria that followed the death of Princess Diana, and it was strangely squandered by Channel 4 on a late-night slot during that brief, culture-wide window of revisionism on the anniversary of her death in 1998. The company offered to pitch my film to the channel while I was in the US, with the aim of turning it around within a few weeks. With this tentative proposal, I flew out to New York four days after conceiving the idea. </p> <p>Digital video and home desktop editing were much-vaunted at the time in guerrilla film-making circles, both as democratising tools and as a way to get out and make movies on the cheap, without waiting for years to garner professional experience, development funding and commissions. I wanted to find out whether this technology could empower a complete novice to shoot, edit, direct and produce a half-way decent documentary film. </p> <p>Hitchens occupies a unique position in America's media culture. He crossed over in the early 80s, when he was poached from the New Statesman by the small, prestigious left-liberal magazine, The Nation, and sent to fill the great IF Stone's shoes as its Washington correspondent. In 1992 Graydon Carter, the urbane Canadian founder of Spy magazine (New York's Private Eye), took the editor's chair at Vanity Fair, and made his old friend and fellow bon-vivant satirist a contributing editor. </p> <p>Hitch, the \"lazy Balliol dandy with the killer instinct of a pit-bull terrier\" (according to Jonathan Raban) had already aroused the suspicions of his Trotskyite student comrades at Oxford because of the ease with which he would change from donkey jacket to dinner jacket and back. Similarly, with his new role in his hated Washington, he would rub shoulders with the political elite (though he was never quite the insider that he has lazily been tagged), and then rub their noses in their own troughs. </p> <p>His microcelebrity status in the US was ratcheted up several notches by his deposition last February to the House Judiciary Committe, the very last act in the impeachment trial of President Clinton. Hitchens testified, on the basis of a lunch he'd had with a friend and White House aide, that the White House had been systematically defaming Monica Lewinsky and other women who had come forward to challenge the president. </p> <p>CNN's unflattering bright lights homed in on the unshaven, boozy, limey hack as he left Congress, and his notoriety reached household proportions overnight. The bulk of the ensuing media feeding frenzy centred on his breaking of the Washington code, a system of journalistic complicity with power which is more insidiously cosy than anything the court of New Labour might vainly aspire to. </p> <p>The annual dinner of the White House Correspondents' Association proved to be a prime example. The hallmark of Hitchens' critique of the American mass media is the notion that there's a cloying political consensus - not only between left and right, but between power and its self-censoring supposed critics in the media. Here, in a ballroom in the Washington Hilton, was the American political-media consensus made flesh, bathed in rich gravy and washed down with cheap wine. </p> <p>Recalling another such dinner, Hitchens had warned me what to expect: \"The president got a standing ovation when he came in - just for coming in - from the press. He got a standing ovation when he got up to give his nothing speech. And he got a standing ovation when he sat down having given a nothing speech. And nobody said a fucking word.\" </p> <p>We were treated to the same spectacle at the correspondents' dinner that night, where an unearned standing ovation for the president followed the \"Patriotic Opening\" ceremonies. Newsweek correspondent Michael Isikoff - author of Uncovering the President, the authoritative and stridently anti-consensual account of the Lewinsky scandal - was to be honoured with the Association's Edgar Allan Poe Award. But the president had refused to grant the award, and Isikoff had called off sick instead of pre-emptively snubbing Clinton. The nauseating stench of a common purpose between chief executive and fourth estate led Hitchens to slip out before Clinton's speech and prepare for his role as de facto host of the Vanity Fair after-party. Meanwhile, my camera caught Clinton's eerily charming quips about the battles he'd had with his audience of reporters over the preceding 12 months. And it caught, in turn, the journalists' enthusiastic appreciation of their president's apparent magnanimity. </p> <p>Gatecrashing the White House correspondents' dinner was always the kind of thing any investigative journalist worth his salt could have pulled off. But only with mini-DV does it become possible to smuggle in a broadcast-quality camera with which to capture the closed-door proceedings with crystal clarity. </p> <p>Now, incredibly, and thanks to a commissioning system that has begun to catch up with the technology, my experiment in guerrilla film-making finally paid off with a sale to Channel 4's prolific low-budget DV strand, The Other Side. </p> <p>That's not to say it paid off financially. Notoriously, films for The Other Side (made by the production company Ideal World) are produced for a micro-budget of \u00a35,000. This includes a \u00a31,000 fee for the director and 10 days in linear and non-linear edit suites. (A normal 50-minute documentary would take six weeks to edit.) Many film-makers come to the series, as I did, with half-finished projects that have had more than \u00a31,000 worth of money and time invested in them, so that Channel 4 has been accused of effectively taking a subsidy from the film-maker. </p> <p>Darren Bender, commissioning editor of 4Later, disagrees: \"The channel could not afford to give so many brand new film-makers (110 so far) the chance to get their films made any other way. If I wanted to save money by filling late night with cheap programmes I'd show some of the free American shows that are sitting in the library.\" </p> <p>There are potential downsides here. Some in the industry warn that the pressure to slash budgets and further exploit workers will only get worse when managers see that programmes can be made on the cheap. Others feel that the shift from film and Digi-Beta to DV heralds a decline in the technical quality of documentaries. But The Other Side is marginal to the schedules, a technical experiment as well as a showcase for new talents. The mainstream use of cheap and basic one-person DV crews in the schedules has concentrated on programmes such as The Real Holiday Show and Deals on Wheels, where access is required. </p> <p>And the attraction of DV-stock costs low enough to allow you to shoot extensive rushes will not be lost on observational documentary-makers - even those working on well-funded TV factual strands. The concerns are real, and it's important that the debate over new technical and editorial formats isn't miscast in generational terms. </p> <p>But from my own experience I would not hesitate to encourage untrained aspiring film-makers to blag access to a camera and try their hands. People have been doing it since the birth of film, but there are now unprecedented opportunities to produce near-professional material that will air on national, terrestrial television. </p> <p>The paperback edition of No One Left to Lie to: The Politics of America's Worst Family, by Christopher Hitchens, to be published on June 7, can be ordered from the Guardian Culture Shop, freephone 0800 3166 102</p>",

      "body": "<p>As usual Felix Dennis, chairman of Dennis Publishing, stole the show when he announced my departure from the editor's chair at his magazine Maxim US. His press release to US media last week was a classic piece of mischief and spin. \"Soutar,\" he headlined it, \"- missing soccer team, warm beer, weird spelling, bad plumbing - returns to head up British publishing division!\" </p> <p>And what a publishing division. By July, I'll be back in London as managing director of IPC's Music &amp; Sport, overseeing some of the most high profile media brands in men's entertainment, including Loaded, Later and the NME. I can't wait. In the meantime, I am in the position of being able to pontificate on the peculiarities of men's publishing on both sides of the Atlantic. Which is why, I presume, the Guardian has asked me to write this. </p> <p>So, America. The most striking thing about the US men's publishing business in 2000 is how much it resembles the UK men's publishing business back in 1995. Remember how British GQ and British Esquire - the established, snooty, advertiser-worshipping titles - were usurped so quickly by the funny, reader-driven men's upstarts led by Loaded and FHM? Well, it's happening all over again in the US. Only this time Maxim leads the brash upstarts. And this time, the established, snooty, advertiser-worshipping titles are . . . American GQ and American Esquire! Shouldn't they be sacking people over at Cond\u00e9 Nast and Hearst for screwing up so badly? Twice in a row? </p> <p>The new titles are, frankly, running away with it. Maxim has achieved figures well in excess of 2m this year, double its 1999 circulation. Stuff is bumping up against 1m and it hasn't even published 10 issues yet. FHM launched here three months ago and if that's not outselling GQ's 700,000 and Esquire's 600,000 within a year, they'll be disappointed. Meanwhile, 10-year-old style mag Details has bitten the dust as a general interest magazine, and will be relaunched as a fashion book after summer. </p> <p>Five years ago in the UK, the established titles reacted decisively to the threat of the new by, er, pretending nothing was happening - that the new wave of men's titles were just a flash in the pan, that they'd soon go away and things would be like they were before. Until recently, that's exactly what Art Cooper and David Granger - the editors-in-chief of GQ and Esquire respectively - were saying here. Cooper, who is approximately 1,000 years old, was quoted last year as saying that Maxim's readers were a) losers, and b) \"masturbators\". At the start of this year, he shamefacedly let slip that Cond\u00e9 Nast research showed that the majority of Maxim readers also read GQ. Statistically speaking, given that Maxim has now three times GQ's circulation, he has to go down as the first magazine editor in history to call all of his own readers wankers. He hasn't spoken publicly much since. </p> <p>Esquire's Granger is taking a smarter and more realistic approach, finally recognising that Maxim and the others do what they do, and they're good at it; but he wants to do something different and capture some mythical \"high ground\". Whether he'll achieve this or not is as uncertain as whether his counterpart on UK Esquire, Peter Howarth, will get his magazine out of the doldrums by putting big blokes' faces on his cover. </p> <p>But at least they're facing up to the fact that, like women's magazines, men's general interest magazines won't go away any time soon. In both the US and the UK, they are now an established part of men's lives. There is a whole generation of male readers which is now conditioned to expect magazines that entertain and enlighten them, and bring them useful, relevant stuff to look at and read. </p> <p>Guys are simply not going to go back to reading specialist magazines about trout fishing and ferret breeding, unless the general interest men's magazines forget to grow with them. (Incidentally, I think that was at the root of the UK men's magazine \"slump\" scare six months ago: there was no overall drop in total figures, it was just that the leading titles had forgotten to evolve their offerings, become formulaic and started to shed bored readers.) </p> <p>So to the future. The Holy Grail now, of course, is to be first to figure out where to guide that audience of men who are growing out of the twenty-something men's titles. IPC's Later, launched for that very purpose, has had a decent start but will still take some developing - and I look forward to being involved in that.

      "bodyText": "As usual Felix Dennis, chairman of Dennis Publishing, stole the show when he announced my departure from the editor's chair at his magazine Maxim US. His press release to US media last week was a classic piece of mischief and spin. \"Soutar,\" he headlined it, \"- missing soccer team, warm beer, weird spelling, bad plumbing - returns to head up British publishing division!\" And what a publishing division. By July, I'll be back in London as managing director of IPC's Music &amp; Sport, overseeing some of the most high profile media brands in men's entertainment, including Loaded, Later and the NME. I can't wait. In the meantime, I am in the position of being able to pontificate on the peculiarities of men's publishing on both sides of the Atlantic. Which is why, I presume, the Guardian has asked me to write this. So, America. The most striking thing about the US men's publishing business in 2000 is how much it resembles the UK men's publishing business back in 1995. Remember how British GQ and British Esquire - the established, snooty, advertiser-worshipping titles - were usurped so quickly by the funny, reader-driven men's upstarts led by Loaded and FHM? Well, it's happening all over again in the US. Only this time Maxim leads the brash upstarts. And this time, the established, snooty, advertiser-worshipping titles are . . . American GQ and American Esquire! Shouldn't they be sacking people over at Cond\u00e9 Nast and Hearst for screwing up so badly? Twice in a row? The new titles are, frankly, running away with it. Maxim has achieved figures well in excess of 2m this year, double its 1999 circulation. Stuff is bumping up against 1m and it hasn't even published 10 issues yet. FHM launched here three months ago and if that's not outselling GQ's 700,000 and Esquire's 600,000 within a year, they'll be disappointed. Meanwhile, 10-year-old style mag Details has bitten the dust as a general interest magazine, and will be relaunched as a fashion book after summer. Five years ago in the UK, the established titles reacted decisively to the threat of the new by, er, pretending nothing was happening - that the new wave of men's titles were just a flash in the pan, that they'd soon go away and things would be like they were before. Until recently, that's exactly what Art Cooper and David Granger - the editors-in-chief of GQ and Esquire respectively - were saying here. Cooper, who is approximately 1,000 years old, was quoted last year as saying that Maxim's readers were a) losers, and b) \"masturbators\". At the start of this year, he shamefacedly let slip that Cond\u00e9 Nast research showed that the majority of Maxim readers also read GQ. Statistically speaking, given that Maxim has now three times GQ's circulation, he has to go down as the first magazine editor in history to call all of his own readers wankers. He hasn't spoken publicly much since. Esquire's Granger is taking a smarter and more realistic approach, finally recognising that Maxim and the others do what they do, and they're good at it; but he wants to do something different and capture some mythical \"high ground\". Whether he'll achieve this or not is as uncertain as whether his counterpart on UK Esquire, Peter Howarth, will get his magazine out of the doldrums by putting big blokes' faces on his cover. But at least they're facing up to the fact that, like women's magazines, men's general interest magazines won't go away any time soon. In both the US and the UK, they are now an established part of men's lives. There is a whole generation of male readers which is now conditioned to expect magazines that entertain and enlighten them, and bring them useful, relevant stuff to look at and read. Guys are simply not going to go back to reading specialist magazines about trout fishing and ferret breeding, unless the general interest men's magazines forget to grow with them. (Incidentally, I think that was at the root of the UK men's magazine \"slump\" scare six months ago: there was no overall drop in total figures, it was just that the leading titles had forgotten to evolve their offerings, become formulaic and started to shed bored readers.) So to the future. The Holy Grail now, of course, is to be first to figure out where to guide that audience of men who are growing out of the twenty-something men's titles. IPC's Later, launched for that very purpose, has had a decent start but will still take some developing - and I look forward to being involved in that. The conventional wisdom is that older men want magazines stuffed with features about the child support agency, their careers, their weight and, um, fatherhood skills. But that sounds pretty dire to me. I don't think I've ever had a conversation with another man about male \"issues\". I don't think that I want to be reminded of the grown-up parts of my life. In fact, there's a good case for proposing that what men want as they get older is less realism, more escapism and more fun. What I am betting on, given the lead that the UK has over the US in pioneering men's publishing formats, is that the revolution will happen in Britain. Thanks for the last year, Felix; it's been a blast. I'll buy you a warm beer back in London any time . . .",

Twenty years ago - perhaps even 10 years ago - all you had to do to gauge the health of current affairs was look at a handful of distinguished, long-running titles - headed by Panorama and World in Action - and stay alert for a very occasional series or blockbuster event (A Question of Ulster). Current affairs can now be just as well assessed by focusing on the many two- or three-parters, supplemented by individually titled single documentaries, that are deeply embedded in the BBC2 and Channel 4 schedules - and, from time to time, BBC1 too.

It might have been better to keep a Panorama title around the programme but as things stand titles are associated with channels. </p> <p>There are other, bigger issues. There were good daily current affairs programmes before the birth of Newsnight (1979) and Channel 4 News (1982), but these two have set very high standards for reactive, studio-based journalism. If Newsnight devotes most - or all - of a programme to, say, the Macpherson report or the release of General Pinochet or the Tony Martin verdict, what should BBC1 and ITV offer outside the scheduled news bulletins? Should we consciously set out to change the balance of resources we put into daily news and current affairs and work that takes longer to reach the audience? How many editions of a programme like Panorama do you need to have in one year to maximise impact while keeping a profile? </p> <p> Can current affairs find a consistent and coherent proposition that attracts younger audiences?

      "body": "<p>ITV is in turmoil. Its senior executives, fury barely controlled, have been in constant meetings for the past few days, with more to come this week. They are trying to cobble together a plan to win big audiences back to news programmes, without bringing back News at Ten, or being forced into a News at 10.30pm compromise. </p> <p>Are their hearts in it? \"It's like being told to revive a Des O'Connor Show when you know in your heart you can't,\" says one key observer. They believe heavy political pressure has been applied. \"What time ITV shows its news has absolutely nothing to do with the government,\" says one of the channel's leading executives. </p> <p>Extraordinarily, no one within ITV seems to have anticipated that the regulator, the independent television commission (which pliantly allowed ITV to bring in a radical new schedule on March 8, 1999), would rule, after reviewing the first year, that the status quo was unacceptable - and demand detailed proposals to reverse the slide by May 18. \"[ITV has] been in denial about it,\" says an executive. Crucially, the diplomatic architect of the original deal, Richard Eyre, has moved on; fatally, the role of ITV network chief executive is vacant. When the 10 members of the commission met on April 20, they were in a grim mood. They know they are handling the hottest of hot political potatoes. And that their role so far in protecting ITV from folly has hardly been heroic. </p> <p>Research before them outlined the substantial collapse in ITV's news audiences, down 13.9% in a year for national bulletins, and an \"unacceptable\" 22% on average for regional news. (In the worst case, Northeast Tonight is down by 33%.) When they had greenlighted the changes - on November 19 1998, sealing the death of News at Ten - the meeting was swung by the full-time senior officials, who said it was time to free up ITV to allow more variety and combat audience decline. </p> <p>Despite huge support for News at Ten in November, much was made of research which showed that the public, if offered the choice, wanted a wider range of programming. The members split, but the move towards a lighter touch won majority backing, and, predictably, unleashed huge controversy. Recklessly, ITV opted to change within four months, before its replacement line-up was ready. </p> <p>This time ITV bosses expected that their argument - that such a massive change needed more time to settle in - would again win the day, although they were savaged by Gerald Kaufman's culture, media and sport committee in March. They expected to escape the regulatory rocks and face yet another review in a year's time. In the month before the key meeting, ITV started furiously promoting its nightly news programmes and presenters, with posters, press ads, and on-air plugs. It was too late. </p> <p>Instead, led by chairman Sir Robin Biggam, and with a roster of new members uncommitted to the original decision around the table, the commission unanimously rallied behind the tough statement, tugging officials behind them. Biggam, a pragmatic businessman who in 1998 declared that it was not the job of a regulator in this age to dictate the time news was shown, has completely changed tack. He is now signalling that he wants resolute action, not a fudge. Insiders say: \"He's raising the temperature. We think he wants the 11pm News moved forward, to 10.30pm.\" </p> <p>When the changes came in, shortly before the Kosovo War last March, no one knew for sure what would happen, given that mass market audiences are on the slide. Behind the scenes, the commission indicated that it could live with a single-figure decline in news audience figures. But the outcome has been far worse than anyone predicted. For instance, the appeal of regional news in the early evening has been hard hit by a revamped Neighbours on BBC1. </p> <p>Within ITV, there is no appetite for bringing back News at Ten, no matter what Tony Blair and other politicians facing an election perhaps a year away think. Nor does the 10.30pm slot find favour, though it's the most likely option to fix part of the problem. As ITV executives know only too well, millions have been committed to making programmes for the 10-11 pm slot, from two-hour dramas spanning 9-11pm to Real Lives documentaries. </p> <p>But beating away at the centre of the debate is an argument that extends way beyond News at Ten. It's about the amount of regulation which is deemed appropriate for the media - in this case commercial television - an issue obviously raised by the proposed Carlton/United merger, which is far more critical for the network even than News at Ten. </p> <p>Biggam was leading ITV towards the lighter touch regulation most see as inevitable in a multi-channel era in the run-up to a new communications white paper and then bill. Yet the very same politicians who wax lyrical about the huge potential of the digital era and e-commerce have reacted furiously to protect something which harks back to the 1960s, a primetime ITV news show. From Blair's outburst in 1998 to Kaufman's report, they clearly view television as much more than a purely profit-making industry. What, then, will they do with the competition commission's report on the merger, due out next month? </p> <p>The confusion is inherent, too, in the stance of advertisers. They are opposed to further ITV consolidation because of the unacceptable concentration of media airtime brought under one roof. But the institute of practitioners in advertising, a key lobby behind last year's changes, attacked the commission's interven tion: \"At a time when we have been pressing for a lighter touch regulation, we view regulator demands based on the ratings levels of individual programmes with some alarm.\" Can you have it both ways? Tony Ball, chief executive of BSkyB - another advocate of a light touch - asked last week: \"How can you still regulate ITV in this manner in an age of true multi-channel choice? Is there really any point in worrying about falling audiences for one particular news programme in a world of five 24-hour news channels?\" </p> <p>Yet behind the commission's decision to get tough lies substantial research into the views of 6,000 people. It constitutes a frank anatomy of ITV. Read it and you understand why this is the hottest of political issues. ITV is seen as \"light-hearted with entertainment at its core\". But within this approachable channel, ITN news (and News at Ten in particular) was seen as \"the people's news\". It was \"broad-minded, understandable, recognisable, light-hearted and straight. In sum, ITV news is credible yet not in-your-face.\" In contrast, BBC News was described as \"businessman's news\" and characterised as \"pompous, difficult, serious and reluctant to change\". The survey also contains a riposte to those who say the solution is 24-hour news. Even people who take news less seriously than others \"expected television to motivate their involvement. This suggests that the rolling news coverage offered by cable and satellite is inappropriate.\" </p> <p>The research highlights the impossibility of getting a solution to suit everyone; 53% of respondents felt they were watching less news, but 57% liked watching dramas and films uninterrupted by News at Ten. However, there was a real sense of grievance that the schedule changes had not delivered good films. The research talks of a sense of betrayal. </p> <p>Whatever happens, it's clear the new 6.30pm Evening News is a bit too early for most people, and the 11pm Nightly News too late, while late-night regional news is judged irrelevant and the early evening regional programmes too long. It remains truly surprising that the commission took so much on trust in 1998. But in trying to retrieve ground now, it knows that the last thing the ITV barons want is to start legal challenges, or make relations with the government any worse. It's a very British mess. </p> <p><strong> Nick Pollard, head of Sky News, former executive producer of News at Ten</strong><br> \"My head tells me such things have gone with the end of regulation. My heart tells me that the weaker ITN is, the better for Sky - though if you believe in quality TV news you don't want that. I don't believe News at Ten will come back, though there would be an audience for it. People have a feeling that news at 10 o'clock is right - there is a definite switch-on factor for our programme.\" </p> <p><strong> Nicky Campbell, Radio 5 Live presenter</strong><br>\"The return of News at Ten would seem an unnecessary addition to the abundance of bulletins we have now. If I want a 10pm news hit I'll watch Sky or the vastly improved News 24; I'd listen to The World Tonight, or get a short blast of 5 Live. I suppose I miss Trevor intoning \"and finally\", or Sir Alastair drooling \"today Princess Diana went shopping\", but it's in the same way I miss World in Action, 24 Hours or Nationwide - as TV history.\" </p> <p><strong> Lindsay Nicholson, editor-in-chief, Good Housekeeping </strong><br> \"The change was a tragedy. News at Ten had tremendous cultural significance. Ordinary people talked about it. The timing was perfect: 11pm is too late if you have to get children up for school or go to work. ITV hasn't replaced it with anything memorable; since it's gone I barely watch ITV.\" </p> <p><strong> Ray Barrett, founder of ad agency BCD&amp;P </strong><br> \"I don't think News at Ten will ever reclaim the enormous gap it once occupied. Serious news audiences have Channel 4 News, News 24, Sky News, even Bloomberg. Or people want soundbite news, like Channel 5's. For advertisers there is a loss: you could use the 10.15pm ad break to launch your most powerful images.\" </p> <p><strong> Mandy Merck, professor of media arts, University of London</strong><br> \"I want the news back at 10pm. Not for Reithian reasons, or to scupper Lord Hollick's chances to coin another billion - just to escape more evenings of prime time pulp. So I'm tuning to BBC2 and waiting for Newsnight.\"</p>",

The members split, but the move towards a lighter touch won majority backing, and, predictably, unleashed huge controversy. Recklessly, ITV opted to change within four months, before its replacement line-up was ready. This time ITV bosses expected that their argument - that such a massive change needed more time to settle in - would again win the day, although they were savaged by Gerald Kaufman's culture, media and sport committee in March. They expected to escape the regulatory rocks and face yet another review in a year's time. In the month before the key meeting, ITV started furiously promoting its nightly news programmes and presenters, with posters, press ads, and on-air plugs. It was too late. Instead, led by chairman Sir Robin Biggam, and with a roster of new members uncommitted to the original decision around the table, the commission unanimously rallied behind the tough statement, tugging officials behind them. Biggam, a pragmatic businessman who in 1998 declared that it was not the job of a regulator in this age to dictate the time news was shown, has completely changed tack. He is now signalling that he wants resolute action, not a fudge. Insiders say: \"He's raising the temperature. We think he wants the 11pm News moved forward, to 10.30pm.\" When the changes came in, shortly before the Kosovo War last March, no one knew for sure what would happen, given that mass market audiences are on the slide. Behind the scenes, the commission indicated that it could live with a single-figure decline in news audience figures. But the outcome has been far worse than anyone predicted. For instance, the appeal of regional news in the early evening has been hard hit by a revamped Neighbours on BBC1. Within ITV, there is no appetite for bringing back News at Ten, no matter what Tony Blair and other politicians facing an election perhaps a year away think. Nor does the 10.30pm slot find favour, though it's the most likely option to fix part of the problem. As ITV executives know only too well, millions have been committed to making programmes for the 10-11 pm slot, from two-hour dramas spanning 9-11pm to Real Lives documentaries. But beating away at the centre of the debate is an argument that extends way beyond News at Ten. It's about the amount of regulation which is deemed appropriate for the media - in this case commercial television - an issue obviously raised by the proposed Carlton/United merger, which is far more critical for the network even than News at Ten. Biggam was leading ITV towards the lighter touch regulation most see as inevitable in a multi-channel era in the run-up to a new communications white paper and then bill. Yet the very same politicians who wax lyrical about the huge potential of the digital era and e-commerce have reacted furiously to protect something which harks back to the 1960s, a primetime ITV news show. From Blair's outburst in 1998 to Kaufman's report, they clearly view television as much more than a purely profit-making industry. What, then, will they do with the competition commission's report on the merger, due out next month? The confusion is inherent, too, in the stance of advertisers. They are opposed to further ITV consolidation because of the unacceptable concentration of media airtime brought under one roof. But the institute of practitioners in advertising, a key lobby behind last year's changes, attacked the commission's interven tion: \"At a time when we have been pressing for a lighter touch regulation, we view regulator demands based on the ratings levels of individual programmes with some alarm.\" Can you have it both ways? Tony Ball, chief executive of BSkyB - another advocate of a light touch - asked last week: \"How can you still regulate ITV in this manner in an age of true multi-channel choice? Is there really any point in worrying about falling audiences for one particular news programme in a world of five 24-hour news channels?\" Yet behind the commission's decision to get tough lies substantial research into the views of 6,000 people. It constitutes a frank anatomy of ITV. Read it and you understand why this is the hottest of political issues. ITV is seen as \"light-hearted with entertainment at its core\". But within this approachable channel, ITN news (and News at Ten in particular) was seen as \"the people's news\". It was \"broad-minded, understandable, recognisable, light-hearted and straight. In sum, ITV news is credible yet not in-your-face.\" In contrast, BBC News was described as \"businessman's news\" and characterised as \"pompous, difficult, serious and reluctant to change\". The survey also contains a riposte to those who say the solution is 24-hour news. Even people who take news less seriously than others \"expected television to motivate their involvement. This suggests that the rolling news coverage offered by cable and satellite is inappropriate.\" The research highlights the impossibility of getting a solution to suit everyone; 53% of respondents felt they were watching less news, but 57% liked watching dramas and films uninterrupted by News at Ten. However, there was a real sense of grievance that the schedule changes had not delivered good films. The research talks of a sense of betrayal. Whatever happens, it's clear the new 6.30pm Evening News is a bit too early for most people, and the 11pm Nightly News too late, while late-night regional news is judged irrelevant and the early evening regional programmes too long. It remains truly surprising that the commission took so much on trust in 1998. But in trying to retrieve ground now, it knows that the last thing the ITV barons want is to start legal challenges, or make relations with the government any worse. It's a very British mess. Nick Pollard, head of Sky News, former executive producer of News at Ten \"My head tells me such things have gone with the end of regulation. My heart tells me that the weaker ITN is, the better for Sky - though if you believe in quality TV news you don't want that. I don't believe News at Ten will come back, though there would be an audience for it. People have a feeling that news at 10 o'clock is right - there is a definite switch-on factor for our programme.\" Nicky Campbell, Radio 5 Live presenter \"The return of News at Ten would seem an unnecessary addition to the abundance of bulletins we have now. If I want a 10pm news hit I'll watch Sky or the vastly improved News 24; I'd listen to The World Tonight, or get a short blast of 5 Live. I suppose I miss Trevor intoning \"and finally\", or Sir Alastair drooling \"today Princess Diana went shopping\", but it's in the same way I miss World in Action, 24 Hours or Nationwide - as TV history.\" Lindsay Nicholson, editor-in-chief, Good Housekeeping \"The change was a tragedy. News at Ten had tremendous cultural significance. Ordinary people talked about it. The timing was perfect: 11pm is too late if you have to get children up for school or go to work. ITV hasn't replaced it with anything memorable; since it's gone I barely watch ITV.\" Ray Barrett, founder of ad agency BCD&amp;P \"I don't think News at Ten will ever reclaim the enormous gap it once occupied. Serious news audiences have Channel 4 News, News 24, Sky News, even Bloomberg. Or people want soundbite news, like Channel 5's. For advertisers there is a loss: you could use the 10.15pm ad break to launch your most powerful images.\" Mandy Merck, professor of media arts, University of London \"I want the news back at 10pm. Not for Reithian reasons, or to scupper Lord Hollick's chances to coin another billion - just to escape more evenings of prime time pulp. So I'm tuning to BBC2 and waiting for Newsnight.\"",

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is a haven of political correctness and human civility.</p> <p>Then you sit for a while in one of those blue seats and listen. Or catch snippets of the short circuit television broadcast that wafts along the corridors where people chat about where to go for lunch.</p> <p>A lawyer on the TV screens asks the witness: \"When the bodies were laid out, dead, on the football pitch, did there seem many more of them than when you had seen them alive and crowded into the gym?\"</p> <p>A 23-year-old man, the only survivor of the massacre of 7,000 men and boys in a field near Srebrenica, is asked by the judge if he wants to say anything. \"If I could speak in the name of the innocent victims, I would forgive the actual perpetrators of the executions because they were misled,\" he says.

Vukovic sits still, only the fingers of his right hand fumbling with the papers in front of him.</p> <p>Unnoticed by the world, dramas like these are being played out five days a week in the Hague. It has been a good spring for the tribunal. Last month, for the first time in the history of war, a United Nations court focused exclusively on rape as a war crime. The trial was running simultaneously with that of one of generals accused of the massacre of 7,000 Muslim men in Srebrenica. Two weeks later, the champagne bottles were cracked open following the arrest of a top political aide to Radovan Karadzic, the psychiatrist with the big hair who led the Bosnian Serbs in the bad, bad years.</p> <p>Thirty-seven suspected war criminals are already here. The last one was delivered only a week ago to chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte's remand centre by the sea. At a cost to the United Nations of \u00a3116.14 per day, each prisoner gets art classes twice a week, video, a coffee machine, satellite TV and conjugal visits. Such is the backlog, these men will wait for at least two and a half years before they step into one of the Hague's three courts.</p> <p>But the prisoners do not include any of the three big names: Karadzic; his creator, Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia; and their loyal, brutal general, Ratko Mladic.</p> <p>When Graham Blewitt, an Australian lawyer who specialised in the prosecution of Nazis, arrived as deputy prosecutor in February 1994, he found an empty office with a desk and chairs: \"I started making calls around the world, to Scotland, England, the United States, trying to recruit the right people. We had stacks of applications, but they were from lawyers who had no skills in this area. In the end, it was the old Nazi network that took on the core of the work here.\"</p> <p>Six years later, Blewitt has built an institution with a budget of almost $100m, with 832 staff working as judges, lawyers, intelligence analysts, field investigators, forensic experts and translators. Others have come and gone, but on a Saturday afternoon you can still find Blewitt in his office, trawling through papers and listening to classical music.</p> <p>\"You get bitten by the war crimes work. It gets into your blood. It has been so exciting, just getting this thing started and off the ground. When we got here, there was nothing.\"</p> <p>Next door to Blewitt's third floor office is his new boss, Del Ponte, a Swiss-born judge who has already taken on the mafia and corrupt Russian politicians. Today she's in a good mood. George Robertson, Britain's former defence secretary and now secretary general of Nato, has just visited her office. Robertson has power and is one of the strongest supporters the Hague has ever had.</p> <p>Normally, Del Ponte hates the press, but today she's happy to pose in front of her wanted poster with a \"watch this space\" look in her eye. She won't talk about when she expects Karadzic, Milosevic and Mladic to arrive at her jail, but gives the impression that Karadzic, at least, could be here quite soon. \"Come back and talk to me in a couple of weeks,\" she says.</p> <p>Unlike her predecessors, Del Ponte is now also getting cooperation from the French, who were once so indifferent to picking up war criminals that their soldiers rented houses from them. \"President Chirac was here in February and she handed him an new arrest order,\" says a Hague employee. \"Ten days later we had the guy here.\"</p> <p>The man Del Ponte wants most is Milosevic. If he is arrested he will be the first democratically elected leader to face the justice of an international court, theoretically laying the legal framework of a system that could try Russia's president elect for Chechnya; could have tried Nixon for Chile or Cambodia. That would not make everyone happy; the US is the most fervent opponent of a permanent international court.</p> <p>In these old insurance company offices in the centre of the dull, well-organised city of the Hague, generous salaries mean that some of the staff can earn double what they get in most of their 68 home countries. Jeffrey Nice, 52, a wealthy English barrister, abandoned his practice in London for a year to prosecute war criminals. Part of his work involved the prosecution of a man who called himself the Serbian Adolf and whose favourite method of execution was to ask his victims to kneel on the ground and place their heads on a grate so it would make less of a mess.</p> <p>Nice, who lives in Canterbury, says the two things that shock him about his work are the \"ease with which a common criminal turned into a killer once you put a mobile phone in one hand and a gun in another\", and the bewildering submissiveness of the victim. \"It seemed like they queued up and waited to be executed. One minute they are well nourished people living in comfortable homes and the next they've got their head on the grate, waiting to be executed.</p> <p>\"You'll never, in England, have cases of such sheer scale. Here your overall project is to deliver international justice.\"</p> <p>Terry Cameron, a field investigator in Bosnia who also served during the war, used to wake up sweating from nightmares. \"The worst thing was dealing with the sniper victims who came in. Some were as young as eight.To see the guys responsible being brought in is a tremendous feeling.\"</p> <p>Glenn Morgan came from the West Midlands police and has worked as an intelligence officer for six years. His job is to work out the command structures of military operations. His training was in British Army intelligence in Northern Ireland. \"It's like working on a jigsaw puzzle. You've got 40 pieces and you need to get a good idea where the other 60 pieces fit in.\"</p> <p>Every fact they uncover is processed into the Hague's computer system, which is sealed to the outside world. On most desks there are two computers, one that accesses the internal computer files, a second for everyday use with email connection and internet facilities. The computer unit has almost 100 staff and 2m documents on file, new ones coming in at the rate of 16,000 a month.</p> <p>But getting Karadzic will be the real signal to the outside world that the Hague is serious. Milosevic and Mladic are more likely to die in the bloody civil war that is brewing in Serbia than surrender to international justice.</p> <p>\"I will have room for a hundred more of them,\" says Del Ponte. She points to a poster offering $5m (\u00a33.2m) for the capture of Bosnia's big three: \"There, they are my three.\"</p> <p>After the Blair government came to power in 1997, the SAS carried out the first arrest. Until then, western governments had been worried more about body bags than justice for the battered Balkans and the crack squads of the SAS, the US Delta Force and commandos from France, Holland and Germany sat around on their well-trained hands and watched the war criminals drink beer in Bosnian bars.</p> <p>Another reason Del Ponte's cells are filling up fast is that nobody in Bosnia seems to care very much that their former leaders are being kidnapped and brought to trial. Initially Britain, France, Germany and the US were all worried about a backlash against their soldiers on the ground. \"So far we've had car tyres slashed, but that's been about it,\" says Terry Cameron.</p> <p>Del Ponte doesn't want to talk about why it is taking so long to get the big names. \"What I care about is when they are going to bring them in. Come to me the day after Karadzic arrives and I will explain everything. I am doing things a prosecutor should not be doing.\"</p> <p>Such things include visiting George Robertson in Nato headquarters to discuss plans for a special international snatch squad to speed up the pick-ups.</p> <p>When, if, Karadzic arrives in the Hague, the hood and earplugs he has been forced to wear during the two-hour flight so he will not recognise the nationality of his captors will be removed. He will be met by a Dutch immigration offical who will sign him into Holland. Tim McFadden, a tall Irishman and his chief jailer in the prison, will be on hand to take charge of him.</p> <p>\"The biggest success with Karadzic will be getting him here alive,\" says Morgan. \"The worry is that there are a couple of Milosevic stooges waiting to put a bullet in his head before he gets here.\"</p> <p>Karadzic will then be dispatched to a cell on one of three floors, where he will be watched on a security camera in case he attempts suicide. At 7.30 the next morning, over breakfast of muesli and fruit juice, he will be reunited with some old friends and enemies, for there is no segregation.</p> <p>\"The funny thing about these guys is that they are pussycats to handle,\" says McFadden. \"They are not idealists. They don't seem to believe in what they were fighting for.\"</p> <p>From the press gallery, we couldn't see the 19-year-old giving evidence. But Zoran Vukovic could, and for two days he listened to her tell the tribunal how he had been part of a group of soldiers who had gang-raped her over a period of five weeks. How, at the end, he had taken her alone to a deserted apartment, to a room on the left hand side of the hallway and raped her again.</p> <p>\"Then, when he had finished, he sat down on the armchair and lit a cigarette,\" she said. \"He said to me, I could do much more to you, but since you're the same age as my daughter, I'll leave it at that.\"</p> <p>Vukovic again scratches desperately at the paper in front of him with his blue Biro.</p> <p>The older women are tougher, merciless in telling it as it was. Vukovic was the kind of a guy who forced them to give him oral sex because he couldn't get an erection. Then he got a gun and became a big guy. The women and girls leave the bench devastated and high, so high.</p> <p>Tejshree Thapa, a young Nepalese woman lawyer, spent more than two years preparing the rape cases. \"After they've given their testimony and left the stand I have broken down and cried,\" she says. \"The older women are better able to cope - they have some sort of social structure. It's the young girls that get to me. They are just completely bewildered by what has happened to them.</p> <p>\"Their best friends are the girls who were raped with them. They are all traumatised, but they end up in refuges in different countries where they don't speak the language.</p> <p>\"They have been terrified of coming into court,\" says Thapa. \"But as soon as they get into the witness box, their anger replaces the fear. All of them have been glad they have done it.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Three judges sit up on the bench looking straight at the witness who is screened from the public by a large cream venetian blind. Everything is blue except the polished teak veneer benches. The stenographer is dressed in jeans and a white shirt. The three judges - male, female, black, white - talk soothingly to the witness. Would you like a break? Another glass of water, perhaps? How is the hotel? The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is a haven of political correctness and human civility. Then you sit for a while in one of those blue seats and listen. Or catch snippets of the short circuit television broadcast that wafts along the corridors where people chat about where to go for lunch. A lawyer on the TV screens asks the witness: \"When the bodies were laid out, dead, on the football pitch, did there seem many more of them than when you had seen them alive and crowded into the gym?\" A 23-year-old man, the only survivor of the massacre of 7,000 men and boys in a field near Srebrenica, is asked by the judge if he wants to say anything. \"If I could speak in the name of the innocent victims, I would forgive the actual perpetrators of the executions because they were misled,\" he says. Inside the blue courtroom, the weight of justice is palpable. \"Do you recognise the man who raped you?\" \"Yes, I can recognise him.\" \"Can you look around the courtroom and let us know where he is?\" \"He is there, with the security guard on his right.\" \"For identification purposes, can you describe him? Please take your time.\" \"He had a light blue tie and a dark blue suit.\" \"What is the name of the man who raped you.\" \"His name is Zoran Vukovic.\" The guard tries to hold his gaze straight ahead, but the temptation to sneak a look at Vukovic is too much. Vukovic sits still, only the fingers of his right hand fumbling with the papers in front of him. Unnoticed by the world, dramas like these are being played out five days a week in the Hague. It has been a good spring for the tribunal. Last month, for the first time in the history of war, a United Nations court focused exclusively on rape as a war crime. The trial was running simultaneously with that of one of generals accused of the massacre of 7,000 Muslim men in Srebrenica. Two weeks later, the champagne bottles were cracked open following the arrest of a top political aide to Radovan Karadzic, the psychiatrist with the big hair who led the Bosnian Serbs in the bad, bad years. Thirty-seven suspected war criminals are already here. The last one was delivered only a week ago to chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte's remand centre by the sea. At a cost to the United Nations of \u00a3116.14 per day, each prisoner gets art classes twice a week, video, a coffee machine, satellite TV and conjugal visits. Such is the backlog, these men will wait for at least two and a half years before they step into one of the Hague's three courts. But the prisoners do not include any of the three big names: Karadzic; his creator, Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia; and their loyal, brutal general, Ratko Mladic. When Graham Blewitt, an Australian lawyer who specialised in the prosecution of Nazis, arrived as deputy prosecutor in February 1994, he found an empty office with a desk and chairs: \"I started making calls around the world, to Scotland, England, the United States, trying to recruit the right people. We had stacks of applications, but they were from lawyers who had no skills in this area. In the end, it was the old Nazi network that took on the core of the work here.\" Six years later, Blewitt has built an institution with a budget of almost $100m, with 832 staff working as judges, lawyers, intelligence analysts, field investigators, forensic experts and translators. Others have come and gone, but on a Saturday afternoon you can still find Blewitt in his office, trawling through papers and listening to classical music. \"You get bitten by the war crimes work.

      "bodyText": "British diplomats and military officials are preparing a 'worst case' plan to evacuate up to 20,000 UK citizens from Zimbabwe. As the country slides towards chaos, there are fears of a mass exodus by white farmers and supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Tension has risen markedly since President Robert Mugabe signalled at the weekend that he would use his special powers to authorise the seizure of white-owned farms, without compensation. Meanwhile, mobs of supporters of Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party, who have taken over 600 farms by force, are now roaming through rural areas seeking out MDC supporters to brutalise and intimidate. Although the MDC has solid backing in the main cities of Zimbabwe, the national trade union movement has been forced to call off today's Workers' Day parade in the capital, Harare, for fear that it might be attacked by Zanu-PF thugs. In all, 14 people have died since the land dispute flared into confrontation and bloodshed. Opposition leaders accuse Zanu-PF of deliberately fanning the violence to bolster its sagging political fortunes in the run-up to national elections. The deteriorating security situation has led to foreign secretary Robin Cook cancelling a planned visit to Iran next week. He will attend a meeting of Commonwealth ministers in London tomorrow, at which discussion is expected to focus on the Zimbabwe crisis. The Foreign Office said that the two-day visit to Tehran had been called off because it would coincide with the announcement of Iranian election results. But a spokesman conceded that Mr Cook was \"very occupied\" by events in Zimbabwe. The foreign secretary has strongly condemned Mr Mugabe's latest moves to confiscate white-owned farms. \"There can be no justification for this.

But it insists that the government must first rein in the army of squatters who have seized land by force. Now, instead of mediating in the dispute and possibly helping to solve it, Britain could be forced to play a leading role in what could become the ethnic cleansing of Zimbabwe. The white farmers and their families account for around 4000 of Zimbabwe's 70,000-strong white community, of whom up to 20,000 are British passport holders. If there is a rush to leave the country, the outline plan is for an armed convoy to carry the evacuees eastwards into neighbouring Mozambique, whose president Joaquim Chissano says he will welcome them.

      "bodyText": "The insatiable appetite of publishers for steamy sex in bestsellers has persuaded Britain's most popular female novelist to hang up her pen. Irish writer Maeve Binchy has confirmed that her next book, Scarlet Feather, will be her last. Her career, spanning almost 20 years, hit a high last year with Tara Road which sold over 1m copies worldwide. But the 59-year-old writer has decided to retire at the top. Binchy said she was unwilling to allow her books to become peppered with the \"steamy sex\" scenes so often desired by today's publishers. \"It's not something I can do, nor will do,\" she told the Sunday Times. \"I've never been to an orgy so I can't do orgy scenes.\" She published her first novel, Light a Penny Candle, in 1982, and it became the first of 10 bestsellers. But despite the fact there will be no more novels from Binchy, she has promised to publish some short stories.",

Under tough government rules announced after the Shipman case doctors struck off the register will be barred from practising for life, except in exceptional circumstances. The GMC spokesman confirmed they were reviewing the way in which doctors are elected on to the governing body. \"We are aware of concerns about the fact that doctors are allowed to stand if they have been struck off. But that is not out of touch with the way other regulatory bodies operate.\" The spokesman added that another reason for the review was the low turnout in the elections. In the GMC's general election last year turnout was 22%. Although the Department for Health would not comment on the specific case a spokesman said it was \"vital the GMC maintained public confidence in its ability to regulate its own doctors\". Dr Colman, 56, who works as a medically qualified barrister in Norfolk, could oversee areas of fitness to practice, standards, registration or education. She said in a statement: \"I am pleased to have been elected by my fellow doctors.\"",

Potential backers are understood to have made it clear to the Phoenix team, led by the former Rover boss John Towers, that any hope of City cash depends on funding from the government. </p> <p>Last Friday, after the 11th hour collapse of its deal to sell Longbridge to the venture capital group Alchemy, BMW said it would close the plant unless it could find another buyer within the month. Phoenix is currently the only bidder and despite previous scepticism about its financial backing the German car maker has now handed over vital financial information and will start detailed discussions with the consortium tomorrow. </p> <p>Mr Byers spoke to Mr Towers yesterday and is to meet him this week. </p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry was seeking European approval for a \u00a3152m aid package, \u00a3129m of it from central funds, to redevelop Longbridge when BMW decided six weeks ago to sell. </p> <p>Sources close to the department said Mr Byers was prepared to switch the \u00a3129million to underwrite the consortium's bid. </p> <p>Insiders said no decision could be taken on the government's final offer, or whether it would be a grant, loan or a mixture of the two, until Phoenix produced its final proposal. </p> <p>The help is dependent on BMW making it clear that it believes a viable plan is on the table. One industry source claimed that Phoenix had scaled down its initial plan to build 250,000 cars a year to as low as 150,000, to reduce the funding needed. </p> <p>That would trigger thousands of redundancies among Longbridge's 9,000 workers and its suppliers, but would still retain many more jobs than under the ill-fated Alchemy scheme. </p> <p>Rover union officials have disclosed that as recently as last Thursday Werner Samaan, BMW's UK head, dismissed the consortium's chances during a meeting with union members at the car firm's headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire. </p> <p>\"He said it was a boy scout operation that stood no chance of succeeding,\" said a union official. </p> <p>\"BMW is under pressure to sell and pull out, not shut and quit. They have signalled more cash will be on the table. We and Phoenix want to see the colour of their money by the end of the week.\" </p> <p>As the Longbridge crisis deepened yesterday, the Munich-based BMW denied reports that it was planning to close Rover's Cowley plant and switch production of the new Mini to Germany. \"It was never our intention to move the Mini from Cowley,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p>Mr Byers' readiness to invest public cash in Phoenix underlines how seriously the government takes the threat of an economic and political melt down in the West Midlands if Longbridge is closed. </p> <p>\"The government has told us it will offer financial support,\" said a source close to the talks. \"But it is not an unconditional offer. Phoenix has to show that it can make Longbridge work because there is no point in wasting huge sums of public money.\" </p> <p>Ministers and union leaders still have huge reservations about the Phoenix consortium and the possible public support would fall well short of the \u00a3700m aid one insider claims would be needed to support the consortium. </p> <p>Ministers are confident of approval from Brussels for a Rover cash lifeline if they can demonstrate that it is a short- term measure to stop the company going under. </p> <p>Mr Byers recently unveiled \u00a3100m in state aid to stave off pit closures and a \u00a3520m loan to enable British Aerospace to develop a superjumbo. </p> <p>The Conservatives last night accused Mr Byers of adopting a \"crisis management\" approach to manufacturing. The shadow trade secretary, Angela Browning, said: \"Stephen Byers must identify what the government's policy is on providing financial support for business.\" </p> <p>She called on the trade and industry secretary to identify the legal basis on which the money was being offered and ensure that the grant was eligible under EU rules.</p>",

The Department of Trade and Industry was seeking European approval for a \u00a3152m aid package, \u00a3129m of it from central funds, to redevelop Longbridge when BMW decided six weeks ago to sell. Sources close to the department said Mr Byers was prepared to switch the \u00a3129million to underwrite the consortium's bid. Insiders said no decision could be taken on the government's final offer, or whether it would be a grant, loan or a mixture of the two, until Phoenix produced its final proposal. The help is dependent on BMW making it clear that it believes a viable plan is on the table. One industry source claimed that Phoenix had scaled down its initial plan to build 250,000 cars a year to as low as 150,000, to reduce the funding needed. That would trigger thousands of redundancies among Longbridge's 9,000 workers and its suppliers, but would still retain many more jobs than under the ill-fated Alchemy scheme. Rover union officials have disclosed that as recently as last Thursday Werner Samaan, BMW's UK head, dismissed the consortium's chances during a meeting with union members at the car firm's headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire. \"He said it was a boy scout operation that stood no chance of succeeding,\" said a union official. \"BMW is under pressure to sell and pull out, not shut and quit. They have signalled more cash will be on the table. We and Phoenix want to see the colour of their money by the end of the week.\" As the Longbridge crisis deepened yesterday, the Munich-based BMW denied reports that it was planning to close Rover's Cowley plant and switch production of the new Mini to Germany. \"It was never our intention to move the Mini from Cowley,\" said a spokesman. Mr Byers' readiness to invest public cash in Phoenix underlines how seriously the government takes the threat of an economic and political melt down in the West Midlands if Longbridge is closed. \"The government has told us it will offer financial support,\" said a source close to the talks. \"But it is not an unconditional offer. Phoenix has to show that it can make Longbridge work because there is no point in wasting huge sums of public money.\" Ministers and union leaders still have huge reservations about the Phoenix consortium and the possible public support would fall well short of the \u00a3700m aid one insider claims would be needed to support the consortium. Ministers are confident of approval from Brussels for a Rover cash lifeline if they can demonstrate that it is a short- term measure to stop the company going under. Mr Byers recently unveiled \u00a3100m in state aid to stave off pit closures and a \u00a3520m loan to enable British Aerospace to develop a superjumbo. The Conservatives last night accused Mr Byers of adopting a \"crisis management\" approach to manufacturing. The shadow trade secretary, Angela Browning, said: \"Stephen Byers must identify what the government's policy is on providing financial support for business.\" She called on the trade and industry secretary to identify the legal basis on which the money was being offered and ensure that the grant was eligible under EU rules.",

And last year it scored no more than 36%.</p> <p>The latest ICM London poll tells a similar story. It suggests that in a general election Labour would win 48% of the vote in the capital. In the Greater London assembly election, however, the very same poll puts Labour at just 43% on the constituency vote.

It is not simply a case of Labour \"core\" voters staying at home, disillusioned. Labour's underperformance locally predates Labour's accession to power and even Tony Blair's elevation to the Labour leadership.

      "bodyText": "Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the Archbishop of Westminster and new leader of the 4.1m Catholics in England and Wales, has said he believes the church's centuries-old tradition of a celibate priesthood could be changed. The archbishop, who was installed at Westminster cathedral in March in succession to Cardinal Basil Hume who died last year, is a theologically orthodox figure but made it clear in an interview with the Guardian that he believes in church reform and, unlike his Scottish counterpart, Cardinal Winning, may take a more understanding line on personal morality. His appointment at the age of 67 - which means he will only have seven years in the job - has been welcomed by mainstream church leaders, especially Anglican bishops who have worked closely with him in promoting closer links between the churches. There is unlikely, however, to be any compromise in the archbishop's support for the Catholic church's line either on abortion or its opposition to the ordination of women, despite a growing campaign by women within the church. On celibacy - which has already been breached in Britain by the acceptance of some married Anglican clergy who have left the Church of England over the issue of women priests - Archbishop Murphy-O'Connor said: \"Disciplines can change. When a priest accepts celibacy when he is ordained that rule should be kept. But is it (marriage) incompatible with priesthood? The answer is obviously no. I would not rule it out. The matter will come up again.\" The new archbishop, a tall, dominating, genial figure with a shock of grey hair, has transferred from the diocese of Arundel and Brighton where he was a popular bishop for 23 years. In his youth he was a rugby player and might have become a professional musician had he not chosen to become a priest instead. He plays the piano and old colleagues remember him singing Gilbert and Sullivan at the seminary in Rome.

      "bodyText": "President Robert Mugabe will invoke special powers next week to seize white-owned farmland without compensation and redistribute it to poor blacks, effectively legalising the recent wholesale occupation of farms led by veterans of the independence war. Mr Mugabe's spokesman, George Charamba, said the president would give himself the authority to continue the confiscations for six months. The opposition accused Mr Mugabe of misusing his powers. The leader of the white farmers union, David Hasluck, said: \"The [union] feels that this is a lack of good faith on behalf of the government while we are trying to negotiate in good faith with the war veterans in an attempt to stop violence and prepare the situation for a free and fair election.\" The Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, said: \"The confiscation of farms without compensation would be a big step backwards. There can be no justification for this. This cannot be the way to solve the genuine problems of land reform.\" The announcement from Mr Mugabe's office appears to reflect a new confidence before the parliamentary elections, which are expected to be called soon. Increasing violence against and intimidation of the government's opponents, and an agreement by white farmers which effectively ends their political activity in many rural areas, has delivered a severe blow to the campaign to topple Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. It is a sign that the opposition is shying away from further confrontation that the trades unions congress called off the strikes and protest rallies planned to mark May Day today and asked its members to stay at home and pray. The main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), insisted that his supporters would not be intimidated. \"We will maintain our activities. Intimidation can never win a vote. We are the majority,\" he said. But the impact of the coercion could be seen at an MDC rally in the opposition's heartland yesterday. Fewer than 200 people turned out for the meeting in the Harare township of Chitungwiza, and most of them declined to wear MDC badges or T-shirts. One young man said his family had urged him not to go. \"People are very afraid to show they support Tsvangirai,\" he said. \"Even if nothing happens today they are worried that Zanu-PF is watching and will remember. People here will still vote for the MDC, but they will not want to say so publicly if they think it will get them killed.\" Zanu-PF has effectively conceded a general election victory to the opposition in the cities, leaving rural areas to decide whether the ruling party will be humiliated at the ballot box. But that issue appears to have been settled by an agreement between the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents most of the country's 4,500 white farmers, and the war veterans' leader, Chenjerai \"Hitler\" Hunzvi. Mr Hunzvi has promised to end the violence in which at least 14 farmers and farm workers have been killed, and hundreds beaten. In return, the union has agreed that its members will stop supporting the MDC and curtail opposition rallies and activities on their farms. It is a blow to the opposition, which has relied on white farmers and businessmen for funds, communications and transport in the campaign, and was hoping to gather considerable backing from farm workers. The white farmers' evident support for the opposition increased the government's fear that many black labourers and their families were swinging behind the MDC. But the widespread intimidation and scattered violence of the land invasions has effectively corralled the farm workers under Zanu-PF control. Labourers are being subjected to political indoctrination and forced to denounce the opposition. It is unlikely that many will dare to vote against the government. Mr Tsvangirai clearly feels betrayed. \"The farmers and farming leaders are wrong to be negotiating with outlaws,\" he said. \"They are pursuing an unsustainable strategy. The farmers must be advised that we must first have the resurrection of law and order.\" Privately, other opposition activists go further, one of them accusing the white farmers of putting their own interests before those of the many Zimbabweans who want a change of government. \"I think this will create a lot of unhappiness with whites,\" he said. \"People will now say they only want to look after themselves.

The latest figures for the US reveal 32,000 fatalities - close on 90 every day. More than 13,000 were murders.

The firm restrictions on gun ownership imposed by some states penalise the law-abiding but don't stop criminals from being armed.

There is one development which gives the gun control lobby hope - aiming to hit gun manufacturers where it hurts them most, in their pockets, by suing them for compensation. The new twist is that instead of being left to the victims, lawsuits are now being brought by more powerful interests - cities, including some of the most important: Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Washington DC.</p> <p>The similarities with tobacco litigation are obvious, and not coincidental. At first, lawsuits against the cigarette makers were brought by ill and dying smokers, with limited success.

The gun industry doesn't have anything like the deep pockets of tobacco. This affects the amount of compensation that might be obtained, and therefore the enthusiasm of lawyers working on a no-win, no-fee basis in the hope of a cut of huge winnings (some of the tobacco lawyers became mega-millionaires at a stroke).</p> <p>There's a more fundamental legal difficulty distinguishing tobacco from guns. With cigarettes, quite apart from the fact that the manufacturers consistently lied about the dangers of their product, the chain of causation was simple. They made harmful cigarettes, people smoked them and got ill as a direct result.</p> <p>But how do you make the makers of a gun responsible if, say, a year after it legally sells it to an authorised dealer, it finds its way into the hands of a criminal who kills in the course of a robbery? Or where a gun is left on the kitchen table by irresponsible parents, and their 10-year-old son picks it up and shoots his sister? Isn't the chain between the manufacturers and the ultimate tragedy too lengthy and too interrupted for the makers to bear the blame?</p> <p>That's the line taken by the arms industry and the gun lobby, and by the sincere people at the shooting range in Chantilly, Virginia, where I learned to fire a .38.

After all, you can't sue General Motors if one of its cars is driven by a drunk and kills a pedestrian.</p> <p>The claims against the manufacturers are based on two main grounds. First, they could easily be making guns safer, by the use of trigger-locks, safety devices and smart-gun technology; but many of them aren't doing so. Second, their distribution and marketing allow guns to get into the wrong hands.</p> <p>\"People who make and sell dangerous things have to take responsibility for them,\" says John Coale, a tobacco litigation pioneer now pursuing the gun interests. \"The manufacturers seem to think that once the gun leaves their factory, they have no responsibility. We say they do, and that they're not protecting the public from their product.</p> <p>\"They know that guns go to dealers who are selling them to criminals. If you have a toxic chemical and it leaves the plant, you're responsible for it all the way down the line because you know it's dangerous.\"</p> <p>So far there's been one successful lawsuit against manufacturers; not by one of the cities - their litigation is still in its early stages - but by an individual. In 1998 Stephen Fox won a judgment in a New York court which broke new ground in gun-makers' liability. The teenager was accidentally shot by a friend boastfully showing off the gun he'd recently bought, illegally.</p> <p>The bullet went into his head. It's still there. The gun was never recovered and he didn't know what make it was. So he (and six other plaintiffs, some of them representing victims who had died) sued 25 main manufacturers for compensation.</p> <p>A jury heard all the manufacturers explain exactly what, if any, precautions they took to ensure that their guns couldn't fall into criminal hands. Were they, for instance, sold at gun shows, where there are very few restrictions, or did they sell only to registered dealers? The jury divided the manufacturers into the careful (who were ruled not liable) and the careless, who had \"failed to use reasonable care in the distribution of their guns\".</p> <p>Eventually they decided that three companies were liable to pay for Stephen Fox's injuries. His compensation was set at nearly $4m (\u00a32.5m). But the guilty manufacturers will pay only the proportion equal to their market share of the gun business.</p> <p>That decision may not be the final word; the result of an appeal is expected soon. But what's already clear is that manufacturers are rattled by the legal onslaught against them.</p> <p>How far the litigation will succeed in bringing down fatalities is another question.

      "bodyText": "Overlooking the birthplace of Andy Capp, now all reborn dockland, big retail sheds, ring roads and flattened steelworks, the men of the Headland district reflect on a town in transition. Like the famous beer-swilling, pigeon fancying, chain-smoking, sexist cadger of the cartoon, the grimy north of old Hartlepool depicted by his creator, the late Reg Smyth, has long since disappeared, along with the flat caps, the whippets and the pit heaps. That should be good news for New Labour, and the local MP - the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson - who played a key role in rebranding the party. Andy Capp might turn in his grave but Hartlepudlians are beginning to question their long-standing political loyalties. There is a whiff of rebellion in the air. This week the unthinkable might just happen: Labour could lose overall control of the local council, thanks partly to an \"unholy alliance\" of Liberal Democrats and Tories. \"That Labour council,\" scoffs Thomas Longwill, walking his dogs along the Headland prom beside the tall Georgian villas of the old industrial elite. \"Takes us for granted. Never see Labour people. Folks feel cheated. OK, Labour say they are addressing the country's problems, but they don't seem to have improved a great deal yet.\" Like scores of others on the Headland, Mr Longwill, a chemical worker, will vote Liberal Democrat this week. He sees Hartlepool changing, partly for the better, but he does not give the Labour council much credit. Disaffection with Labour's town hall rulers runs across northern England and the Lib Dems are steadily gaining ground. But Hartlepool's political elite has been edging towards self-destruction, although Mr Mandelson has generally managed to rise above the turmoil. \"He sees it as old Labour feuding and nothing to do with the new politics,\" says a local ally. Nationally, Tony Blair, who represents neighbouring Sedgefield, has distanced New Labour from the old party machines running local councils in the north. But with the party facing big losses in seats won four years ago at the height of Tory unpopularity, strategists recognise Labour has much ground to recover before a likely general election next year, particularly in heartlands like Hartlepool. Having had three council leaders over the past three years, Labour's opponents in Hartlepool can capitalise on a bitterly divided Labour group. Its officials are resigned to the Lib Dem-Tory opposition making headway this week, partly as a result of the in-fighting. \"I don't think we will lose control, but I'd be foolhardy if I suggested we will not lose any seats,\" says Russell Hart, an accountant who has been council leader for a year and - unlike his predecessor - is a strong Mandelson supporter. He points to an \"unholy alliance\" under which Tories are not fielding candidates in six key seats, to give the Lib Dems a clear run, and the Lib Dems are not contesting two wards which the Tories could win. \"Wholly unprincipled, gutter politics,\" he says. \"To deny Tory and Lib Dem supporters an opportunity to vote for their parties is plain evil.\" Arthur Preece, the Lib Dem leader, says he is confident the combined opposition will make the seven gains necessary to remove Labour from overall control.

My bet is there will be a fair sprinkling of civilians among the class warriors. To expect otherwise would be to pretend that only the perennially disaffected have a grievance against global capital to determine what kind of lives we will live in the 21st century.</p> <p>Multinational corporations have been a bogy for the left since Karl Marx first chewed the end of his pencil. Never have they offered more cause for concern than 10 years after the collapse of the socialist bloc and five after the establishment of the Word Trade Organisation. According to Corporate Watch, 51 of the world's 100 largest economies are corporations and the combined revenues of just two of them - General Motors and Ford, exceed the combined GDP for all of south Saharan Africa. Here in the UK we seem to be deeply attached to the idea of national sovereignty.

After all, the steps towards integration in the European Union were clear. They were subject to exhaustive parliamentary debate and, on occasion, referendum. The extent of the powers vested in the institutions of the EU is described in exhaustive detail in volume after volume of acquis communitaire . And though there is general agreement that there is a democratic deficit in the structures of the EU, there is at least an elected parliament that is steadily acquiring powers.

If you want to complain or protest about the conduct of matters in the EU, it is possible to find out where you should do so. A far more convincing symbol of a powerful, faceless process that not only attacks national sovereignty and weakens democratic institutions but invades every aspect of daily life is the WTO.</p> <p>Since it was set up in 1995, the WTO and the globalisation that it is there to promote, has impacted on our lives on every level. The advocates of untrammelled global free trade argue that this is all to our benefit. The demonstrators in Seattle last year and today on the streets of London - and those who quietly cheer them on - say that's not the whole story. We are wealthier, better fed, better housed and longer lived than at any time in history. And the last two decades have delivered an extraordinary rate of growth that has lifted millions out of poverty. Free market purists argue that all the ills the process has produced can be cured by further liberalisation.</p> <p>The counter argument was thoroughly made at Seattle: that the cost of this economic growth in environmental terms is unpayable, that the political price is too high, that the power of the global corporations that are the prime beneficiaries of the system is too great, that the huge disparities in wealth the process has produced are immoral. For most people the argument is not whether there should be capitalism or not. It is: what kind of capitalism? What degree of rapacity can I accept in return for the benefits I enjoy?</p> <p>If I want to say yes to capitalism but not on the terms proposed under the WTO millennial round, to whom do I say it, short of joining the protest on the street? If I want to say yes to trade, but only if the workers in south China's free trade zone factories can get some modicum of labour protection, whom do I lobby? If I want to say yes to internationalism but no to a world in which international institutions are a thin disguise for dominating US corporations, to whom do I address my postcard?</p> <p>And today's protesters have their answer, as the protesters in Washington and Seattle had theirs. Their presence in Seattle and since has focussed the unease felt by many who would not join them. But protest has its limitations and one of them is that protest is not a negotiating position. Even if negotiations were offered, it is hard to see a coherent alternative vision in the many positions on the street.</p> <p>Lucy Parsons, of Reclaim the Streets, told the Financial Times that the protests were aimed at \"taking power away from the politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats\" and forcing \"radical social and ecological changes\". But taking power from the politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats does not of itself make power disappear. My limited experience of moments when nobody was in charge (in countries that were in the throes of disintegration) suggests that they are more dangerous and unpleasant than even the most rapacious forms of capitalism are able to be in a society that has not broken down.</p> <p>Last century's alternative to capitalism was voted out by history. Since overthrowing capitalism is not really an option, what we are faced with is the much more complicated challenge of fashioning capitalism into a garment that we can live with. We are unlikely to find contentment where we are valued mainly for our ability to produce and consume; when the planet we inhabit in common is being depleted in pursuit of profits that enrich an ever smaller group; when global capitalism overrides democratic mechanisms and reaches ever deeper into our lives; trying to shape our societies down to the smallest detail, using our selfishness and greed as its main weapon. The global market delivered growth, but what is the purpose of this growth? The only acceptable answer is that it is to enhance human welfare, a standard by which we are entitled to measure the damage to the environment, health, dignity and family life.</p> <p>The WTO has given globalisation a huge boost, but where are the international bodies parallel to the WTO that can regulate and control the corporations - or even force them to pay tax? Where is the democratic body that corresponds to the WTO, where then objections of the citizens can be heard? These are all concerns raised by the protesters and echoed by a much wider group, but nowhere does the political conversation reflect them. We are in the grip of an orthodoxy that tells us not only that there is no alternative to further globalisation, but that it is all for the best.</p> <p>Yet in the last few months, the IMF and the World Bank, pillars of that orthodoxy, admitted that the liberalising prescriptions that they have dispensed for 20 years may not have done any good - staggering admissions, which have produced almost no political debate. Globalisation of trade has generated the globalisation of protest - the internet allows movements to build critical mass - as they fight against the Multilateral Agreement on Investment or Monsanto's terminator gene.

Claiming to be mystified by the reports, he said: \"I'm not preparing a book.\" However, it appears that Mr Dobson is unlikely to return to the cabinet after the election, which according to latest polls could see him slipping into fourth place behind Mr Livingstone, Mr Norris and Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer. One Labour source stressed Mr Dobson's popularity within his own party, but admitted scepticism over reports that the former health secretary could take over from Margaret Beckett as the leader of the house. With the exception of the \"special case\" of Peter Mandelson, made Northern Ireland secretary after resigning as trade secretary over a home loan, Tony Blair has no track record in bringing former cabinet members back to the front bench after they are reshuffled, insiders point out. With days to go to the election, Labour spin doctors are attempting to focus last-ditch campaigning on to the alleged untrustworthiness of Mr Livingstone. Labour yesterday made clear its intention carefully to scrutinise the expenses lodged by the former GLC leader to see if he has passed the \u00a3420,000 spending limit. Advertising industry insiders estimated the cost of Mr Livingstone's election broadcast at \u00a3200,000, while there had also been a costly poster blitz, Labour claimed. A spokesman said: \"When Ken puts his (expenses) in we will be looking to see whether he has followed the rules and accounted for his spending properly, and if any of his figures are suspicious we will go ahead with a complaint.\" Mr Norris told LWT's Seven Days debate: \"I think he [Mr Livingstone] had better check with his treasurer because we all know what the prices are and a lot of us think Ken is getting pretty close to the wire.\" However Mr Livingstone said that he had given his campaign staff \"clear instructions\" not to spend more than \u00a3400,000.",

      "body": "<p>The first robot-controlled taxi service will be installed somewhere in the world between 2004 and 2007. </p> <p>Not only that, but before the present decade is out, tomorrow's Kate Adie and her television journalist colleagues will transmit what they see - live - to television screens from microsensors embedded in their optic nerves. </p> <p>And what they say will be picked up by mobile phone transmitters implanted in their shoulders.</p> <p>Two years after that, the first factories will be at work in space, making high-quality microchips and pharmaceuticals from very pure crystals grown in space, and shipping the finished products back to earth in autopilot space shuttles. </p> <p>This is the future, according to Roke Manor Research, part of the technology giant Siemens. And, the scientists say today , they are not proposing a robot fairyland. </p> <p>\"We are working on many of these future technologies now, and all of these scenarios are technically possible already,\" said Ian Stewart of Roke Manor Research. </p> <p>Some of these future shocks are not just technically possible, they have already been proposed by British government foresight committees. Others are gradually being introduced by commercial groups. </p> <p>By 2006, \"biometric\" signatures will be commonplace. Workers will gain entry, and customers will get their credit balances, at a mere glance, after computer-based optical recognition of the unique pattern of the iris. </p> <p>Stolen personal technology equipment will refuse to work because it cannot recognise the pattern of the owner's fingerprints. PIN numbers will, like pen and ink signatures, just be \"old technology.\" </p> <p>People will vote online by 2007 in local and national elections, from mobile terminals anywhere in the world, and the numbers voting will be greater, the researchers say. But the two main parties will suffer at the expense of liberals and minority candidates. </p> <p>By 2005 viewers \"going out\" will be a matter of staying in: people will download films, live concerts and football matches to watch at any time, and work on the move with their slimline digital communications devices. </p> <p>If people do go to the cinema or the supermarket, they will do so without credit cards or cash: the vendor's till will negotiate with customer's \"mobile phone wallet\", deducting money which will be topped up by automatic wireless contact with the banks. Children won't carry bulging satchels, because all their school textbooks will be available at the touch of a screen. </p> <p>There will be problems in this electronic, bionic nirvana. Implants will help foreign correspondents get the story swiftly and discreetly - but there won't be many who will go for an optic nerve camera fitment. It could go expensively wrong, and it will raise huge surveillance and civil liberties problems. </p> <p>Robot taxis, responding to electronic signals from navigation beacons, should be safer, cheaper and more fuel efficient - but their use will become part of a status symbol package, which should drive the price up. </p> <p>In a cashless, automatically-deducted world, spending money will become alarmingly easy. But internet trading across national boundaries will make tax collection accordingly difficult. </p> <p>The space factory is, paradoxically, one of the oldest prophecies. Sixties seers confidently expected huge settlements of 10,000 people living and working in vast, wheeling space stations by 2001. </p> <p>In fact, the International Space Station now being assembled in orbit is behind schedule - but there is increasing pressure from entrepreneurs who want space factories and businesses to grow up around the space station like traders around a western frontier fort. </p> <p>Some of the Siemens projections are quite conservative. There are probably more than a million industrial robots in the world already. Ian Pearson, employed as a futurologist by BT, several years ago predicted robots will rescue people from burning buildings by 2009 at the latest, followed swiftly by household domestic robots to fetch and tidy, with robot mail delivery and robot personal trainers arriving by 2015. </p> <p>By 2030 at the latest, he says, there will be more robots than people in developed countries. </p> <p>Kevin Warwick, professor of cybernetics at Reading University, long ago predicted takeover by machines.

      "bodyText": "The first robot-controlled taxi service will be installed somewhere in the world between 2004 and 2007. Not only that, but before the present decade is out, tomorrow's Kate Adie and her television journalist colleagues will transmit what they see - live - to television screens from microsensors embedded in their optic nerves. And what they say will be picked up by mobile phone transmitters implanted in their shoulders. Two years after that, the first factories will be at work in space, making high-quality microchips and pharmaceuticals from very pure crystals grown in space, and shipping the finished products back to earth in autopilot space shuttles. This is the future, according to Roke Manor Research, part of the technology giant Siemens. And, the scientists say today , they are not proposing a robot fairyland. \"We are working on many of these future technologies now, and all of these scenarios are technically possible already,\" said Ian Stewart of Roke Manor Research. Some of these future shocks are not just technically possible, they have already been proposed by British government foresight committees. Others are gradually being introduced by commercial groups. By 2006, \"biometric\" signatures will be commonplace. Workers will gain entry, and customers will get their credit balances, at a mere glance, after computer-based optical recognition of the unique pattern of the iris. Stolen personal technology equipment will refuse to work because it cannot recognise the pattern of the owner's fingerprints. PIN numbers will, like pen and ink signatures, just be \"old technology.\" People will vote online by 2007 in local and national elections, from mobile terminals anywhere in the world, and the numbers voting will be greater, the researchers say. But the two main parties will suffer at the expense of liberals and minority candidates. By 2005 viewers \"going out\" will be a matter of staying in: people will download films, live concerts and football matches to watch at any time, and work on the move with their slimline digital communications devices. If people do go to the cinema or the supermarket, they will do so without credit cards or cash: the vendor's till will negotiate with customer's \"mobile phone wallet\", deducting money which will be topped up by automatic wireless contact with the banks. Children won't carry bulging satchels, because all their school textbooks will be available at the touch of a screen. There will be problems in this electronic, bionic nirvana. Implants will help foreign correspondents get the story swiftly and discreetly - but there won't be many who will go for an optic nerve camera fitment. It could go expensively wrong, and it will raise huge surveillance and civil liberties problems. Robot taxis, responding to electronic signals from navigation beacons, should be safer, cheaper and more fuel efficient - but their use will become part of a status symbol package, which should drive the price up. In a cashless, automatically-deducted world, spending money will become alarmingly easy. But internet trading across national boundaries will make tax collection accordingly difficult. The space factory is, paradoxically, one of the oldest prophecies. Sixties seers confidently expected huge settlements of 10,000 people living and working in vast, wheeling space stations by 2001. In fact, the International Space Station now being assembled in orbit is behind schedule - but there is increasing pressure from entrepreneurs who want space factories and businesses to grow up around the space station like traders around a western frontier fort. Some of the Siemens projections are quite conservative. There are probably more than a million industrial robots in the world already. Ian Pearson, employed as a futurologist by BT, several years ago predicted robots will rescue people from burning buildings by 2009 at the latest, followed swiftly by household domestic robots to fetch and tidy, with robot mail delivery and robot personal trainers arriving by 2015. By 2030 at the latest, he says, there will be more robots than people in developed countries. Kevin Warwick, professor of cybernetics at Reading University, long ago predicted takeover by machines. Three years ago, he implanted an identification chip and transponder in his arm to make doors open and machines switch on, and introduced himself to the world as \"Kevin Warwick, part man, part cyborg.\" Meaningful glances \u0095 Bank customers will get their credit balances at a glance as machines recognise unique iris patterns by 2006. \u0095 People will vote online in elections from mobile terminals by 2007. \u0095 Robot controlled taxis will be in use by 2007. \u0095 TV journalists will be able to transmit what they see using sensors in their optic nerves by 2010. \u0095 By 2030, there will be more robots than people in developed countries.",

John Castle was the unrepentant historian, squirming under the lethal examination of Michael Byrne as Richard Rampton QC.

The acting was spectacular - and special mention should go to the cast's two redheads, Damian Lewis and Rose Keegan, who may haunt Frank Dobson's ginger nightmares in the coming weeks. Channel 4 continued the trend of hit-and-run film-making with a dramatisation of the recent David Irving case in The Holocaust On Trial (Saturday). John Castle was the unrepentant historian, squirming under the lethal examination of Michael Byrne as Richard Rampton QC. The holes in Irving's argument were unpicked stage by stage, his absurd claims looking particularly vicious against archive footage from the camps. A cool and deadly lesson in the Holocaust's planning and execution. Watched, one hopes, by millions.",

General Jose Calimlim, the deputy head of the armed forces and head of intelligence, said troops control 95% of the rebel camp on Basilan island. The hostages and rebels are believed to be in a concrete-reinforced tunnel under the camp and troops are advancing cautiously to avoid harming the captives, said Gen Calimlim. He said the guerrillas, who are fighting for an Islamic state in the south of this mostly Roman Catholic country, abandoned guns and other equipment when they retreated into the tunnel. The hostages, all Filipinos and held for more than a month, include 22 children and five adults, one of whom is a Catholic priest. \"We suspect the remaining rebels have gone inside a tunnel that is 200 metres long and taken the hostages with them,\" the general said. \"We still have to search the tunnel. We haven't recovered the hostages - there is no contact with them or with the rebels.\" Elsewhere, the government's chief hostage negotiator said soldiers had surrounded rebels holding another 21 captives, including 10 foreign tourists, but warned against military intervention. And, in a further move reflecting the widening religious conflict in the Philippines, the largest Muslim group fighting for an Islamic state in the south suspended peace talks yesterday, blaming the government for violating a ceasefire. \"The Moro Islamic Liberation Front hereby unilaterally declares that the peace talks [are] indefinitely suspended,\" an MILF statement said. But the presidential press secretary, Ricardo Puno, appeared to disagree. \"The lines are still open,\" he said. The military has said that about 300 MILF guerrillas and more than 30 soldiers have died in clashes which started in mid-March after the rebels seized and briefly occupied a town hall in Lanao del Norte province on Mindanao island, 500 miles south of Manila. The MILF is the largest of two groups fighting for Muslim self-rule in the Philippines' southern region. The more radical Abu Sayyaf is the one holding the two groups of hostages. In the hostage crisis involving foreign tourists, Muslim regional governor Nur Misuari, a former rebel, threatened to end negotiations unless the guerrillas started releasing the captives. \"These people are already literally encircled from all sides,\" Mr Misuari said. \"Either we expedite the release of these people or we terminate the negotiations. The hostages were taken from Malaysia last Sunday and are being kept on the mountainous Jolo island, which is a stronghold of Abu Sayyaf. Mr Misuari said his emissaries had reported that most of the hostages had diarrhoea and that one was \"sick with a bleeding ulcer\". The hostages include 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French, nationals, two South Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese and a Filipino woman. Reuters",

      "body": "<p>T odd Webb, who has died aged 94, took up photography as a second career 60 years ago, and remained committed to it for more than half a century. His first fame came with his images of cities, principally New York and Paris. His work gradually expanded to encapsulate all forms of people and architecture, perhaps most of all people in their own environments.</p> <p>While he was a master of the absent presence - writer Mike Rowell commented that \"even in the emptiest of scenes, we have the feeling that someone has just left and will step back into view any second\" - Webb also incorporated subjects in their surroundings, as though they could belong nowhere else. His portrait of his great friend, the painter Georgia O'Keefe, photographed from behind and looking out of the studio across the New Mexico desert, is as firmly planted in the frame as a snail in its shell.</p> <p>Webb was born in Detroit, Michigan, and educated at the University of Toronto. \"Until I discovered photography in 1939, I had quite a normal life,\" he later wrote. \"The banking business and the export business, with a few years prospecting for gold in southwestern United States and Central America constituted my conception of the ideal life. Came 1939, and photography - and I really started to live.\"</p> <p>What Webb learned, while studying in Detroit under Ansel Adams and Art Siegel, was the mastery of a large format view camera (with a frame of either 5x7in or 8x10in) and the pursuit of a passion around the streets where he lived. Later on, he acknowledged a formative generation as his \"teachers\" - Stieglitz, Walker Evans, Helen Levitt, Paul Strand and Harry Callaghan, among others.</p> <p>When America entered the second world war, Webb joined the navy, and was fortunate in being given photographic missions. Two years were spent with the US 7th Fleet in the south Pacific, photographing particularly in New Guinea and the Philippines.</p> <p>This experience marked out a fascination with the way people live that was to later include studies of the Pennsylvanian Amish, indigenous Mexicans, the inhabitants of Spanish and black Harlem, sub-Saharan Africa, and 19th-century Texas homes and public buildings - the subjects of two later books and exhibitions which signalled his involvement with south-west America, an area to which he repeatedly returned, eventually to live.</p> <p>In 1946 he joined Roy Stryker, whose famous Farm Security Administration (FSA) had included such luminaries of documentary photography as Dorothea Lange, Jack Delano, Marion Post - and, of course, Walker Evans. Their task was to at tempt to improve social conditions in the dustbowl states by showing the unacknowledged poverty at the heart of what was already the wealthiest nation on earth. Webb was promptly sent to New York to document the building of the Rockefeller Centre, and he later worked on projects following pipelines to Montreal and ice jams on the Ohio river, interspersed with his Louisiana story, and others on the streets of New York.</p> <p>It was a natural progression from Stryker to work for the United Nations, the UN Children's Fund (Unicef), the World Health Organisation and the World Bank. Webb's Esso building was included in Steichen's Family Of Man book, with images from around the world intended to demonstrate how people are \"everywhere different and everywhere the same.\" At the same time, he was completing assignments for a raft of US magazines, ranging from Fortune to Life, and Ladies Home Journal to Cosmopolitan.</p> <p>In 1949, Webb met his New York-born wife Lucille in Paris.

      "bodyText": "T odd Webb, who has died aged 94, took up photography as a second career 60 years ago, and remained committed to it for more than half a century. His first fame came with his images of cities, principally New York and Paris. His work gradually expanded to encapsulate all forms of people and architecture, perhaps most of all people in their own environments. While he was a master of the absent presence - writer Mike Rowell commented that \"even in the emptiest of scenes, we have the feeling that someone has just left and will step back into view any second\" - Webb also incorporated subjects in their surroundings, as though they could belong nowhere else. His portrait of his great friend, the painter Georgia O'Keefe, photographed from behind and looking out of the studio across the New Mexico desert, is as firmly planted in the frame as a snail in its shell. Webb was born in Detroit, Michigan, and educated at the University of Toronto. \"Until I discovered photography in 1939, I had quite a normal life,\" he later wrote. \"The banking business and the export business, with a few years prospecting for gold in southwestern United States and Central America constituted my conception of the ideal life. Came 1939, and photography - and I really started to live.\" What Webb learned, while studying in Detroit under Ansel Adams and Art Siegel, was the mastery of a large format view camera (with a frame of either 5x7in or 8x10in) and the pursuit of a passion around the streets where he lived. Later on, he acknowledged a formative generation as his \"teachers\" - Stieglitz, Walker Evans, Helen Levitt, Paul Strand and Harry Callaghan, among others. When America entered the second world war, Webb joined the navy, and was fortunate in being given photographic missions. Two years were spent with the US 7th Fleet in the south Pacific, photographing particularly in New Guinea and the Philippines. This experience marked out a fascination with the way people live that was to later include studies of the Pennsylvanian Amish, indigenous Mexicans, the inhabitants of Spanish and black Harlem, sub-Saharan Africa, and 19th-century Texas homes and public buildings - the subjects of two later books and exhibitions which signalled his involvement with south-west America, an area to which he repeatedly returned, eventually to live. In 1946 he joined Roy Stryker, whose famous Farm Security Administration (FSA) had included such luminaries of documentary photography as Dorothea Lange, Jack Delano, Marion Post - and, of course, Walker Evans. Their task was to at tempt to improve social conditions in the dustbowl states by showing the unacknowledged poverty at the heart of what was already the wealthiest nation on earth. Webb was promptly sent to New York to document the building of the Rockefeller Centre, and he later worked on projects following pipelines to Montreal and ice jams on the Ohio river, interspersed with his Louisiana story, and others on the streets of New York. It was a natural progression from Stryker to work for the United Nations, the UN Children's Fund (Unicef), the World Health Organisation and the World Bank. Webb's Esso building was included in Steichen's Family Of Man book, with images from around the world intended to demonstrate how people are \"everywhere different and everywhere the same.\" At the same time, he was completing assignments for a raft of US magazines, ranging from Fortune to Life, and Ladies Home Journal to Cosmopolitan. In 1949, Webb met his New York-born wife Lucille in Paris. Living in the French capital for four years formed the basis of two of his most successful touring exhibitions, Paris Architecture (1950) and Photographs Of Paris (1951). Back in America by the mid-1950s, and winner of a Guggenheim fellowship, he used the diaries of 19th-century prospectors as a guide to a series of projects on the great American gold rush - in five months, travelling from New York to San Francisco, he took more than 7,500 pictures. The alternation between commercial and social photography, combined with his talent for capturing an atmosphere, persisted throughout. Webb's work appeared regularly in solo and group shows, and he was a formative element in the New Subjectivity movement that emerged in the 1950s. Of his own method, he wrote: \"Creative photography does not have anything to do with location, projects or causes as such, yet it can involve any one of them. It is a need to express something within the photographer. A creative photograph is one seen through the photographer. The reason for making the photograph is often unexplainable.\" Webb's early friend and lifelong mentor, Beaumont Newhall, put it differently. \"He has chosen to record that which is not spectacular; his approach is the opposite of the news photo- grapher, who seeks the novel and the unusual.\" Webb was compared to many eminent predecessors and contemporaries, among them Eugene Atget, Berenice Abbott and Edward Weston. His photographs are on permanent display in 25 museums, including the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, the Musem of Modern Art, New York, and Washington's National Gallery of Art. His latter books include Georgia O'Keeffe: The Artist And Her Landscape (1984), and a reprise of Photographs Of New York and Paris 1946-60 (1985). Todd Webb is survived by his wife.

If WPP attempted to impose on the group during the 12 months, a series of punitive clauses would be triggered including Y&amp;R executives being able once again pick up multi-million dollar pay-offs. The clauses would also have been triggered had WPP forced Y&amp;R staff either to travel more often or work longer hours than normal.",

I hire him for \u00a320 a day, the equivalent of a month's salary. \"I will not be forgettable,\" he truthfully promises. I had been advised to wear salwar kameez and keep my head covered since Islamic fundamentalism prevails. After a couple of days, I find these outfits far less intrusive and more enjoyable than western dress. Paradoxically, with fewer bits on show, I'm freer.</p> <p>En route to the hotel (a sign politely asks guests to leave arms at reception), Ijaz asks if I'd like to see the sights. He is unfazed when I explain it is not Mogul artefacts I'm interested in but a trip down memory lane. My parents and I arrived in Peshawar in 1956 when I was nine. My father was a radio operator, a Morse code man, attached to the Foreign Office. For two days in July that year we were under siege in the British compound as students rioted in support of Nasser and the nationalisation of the Suez Canal. In 1998, when I began writing a novel, I wanted to use as a backdrop that place and that time, a period when class, race, gender and empire underwent a major overhaul.</p> <p>Forty years on, however, British road names have been removed and clues are scarce. Ijaz takes me to the Peshawar Swimming Club and a memory stirs. In the 50s, this was the centre of social life. Now the horseshoe bar, the largest in the world, has been removed. Peshawar is teetotal. \"The patient is alive but the pulse has gone,\" says one elderly member mournfully.</p> <p>Ijaz and I eventually discover my old home has become the dilapidated office of a gas company. Clerks follow me from room to room, enthusiastically shifting furniture. \"As you like?\" Ijaz asks anxiously, as if he can tailor the past to suit my needs. I nod. Everyone breaks into relieved smiles.</p> <p>The next morning we drive to Murree, a hill station near Kashmir, where I went to boarding school. Here, a magnificent figure in a fan-tailed turban introduces himself as Raja Umar Dad Khan. Umar is chief (raja) of a nearby village where each of his children has a house. In the evening dusk, he walks me to Pindi Point. The views are staggeringly beautiful; deep purple shadows creep across olive green valleys. \"Damn beautiful,\" he says.</p> <p>I spend a day at Umar's village. Head of the clan is his wife, Barbara, a magnificent matriarch not unlike that queen of Coronation Street, Elsie Tanner. She is ferocious, funny and has little time for Umar's sentimental affection for all things English.</p> <p>Barbara believes in Islam and arranged marriages (though her own, 40 years ago, was a love match), and watches closely as her subdued daughters-in-law - her domestic help - prepare lunch.</p> <p>Families like Umar's have to be monumentally industrious because corruption and poverty is rife. The average life expectancy for women is 50, for men 51. Electricity was supplied to the village a decade ago but \"the flush\" has yet to arrive. So several times a day the women carry on their heads tins of water from the well, each weighing many pounds. A 12-year-old can manage it; I can't.</p> <p>Despite the hardships, Barbara is adamant her life is better than mine. While in this part of Pakistan, the chances of a woman escaping an abusive family are practically nil, and honour killings of raped and adulterous women still occur, legally they are now banned. Barbara points out it is the very strictness of the code that offers women security and grants them seniority as they age - a respect denied women in the west.</p> <p>\"You can't have something for nothing,\" she argues equably. \"Your kind of freedom means everyday violence and women who are struggling alone, unprotected and unhappy.\" She doesn't change my mind, but she does make our lives appear less black and white, more different shades of grey.</p> <p>Barbara is half-English. Her father was a soldier who left after the war, promising to return. She has no inclination to visit the UK, she says. \"Why should I, when I have so many riches here?\"</p> <p>The day before my plane home, in a strange echo of my first visit to Pakistan, I find myself under siege.

      "bodyText": "\"Happy Felicitates,\" Ijaz says at Peshawar airport in Pakistan. He tells me he is 23, a law student, driving taxis to pay for his studies. I hire him for \u00a320 a day, the equivalent of a month's salary. \"I will not be forgettable,\" he truthfully promises. I had been advised to wear salwar kameez and keep my head covered since Islamic fundamentalism prevails. After a couple of days, I find these outfits far less intrusive and more enjoyable than western dress. Paradoxically, with fewer bits on show, I'm freer. En route to the hotel (a sign politely asks guests to leave arms at reception), Ijaz asks if I'd like to see the sights. He is unfazed when I explain it is not Mogul artefacts I'm interested in but a trip down memory lane. My parents and I arrived in Peshawar in 1956 when I was nine. My father was a radio operator, a Morse code man, attached to the Foreign Office. For two days in July that year we were under siege in the British compound as students rioted in support of Nasser and the nationalisation of the Suez Canal. In 1998, when I began writing a novel, I wanted to use as a backdrop that place and that time, a period when class, race, gender and empire underwent a major overhaul. Forty years on, however, British road names have been removed and clues are scarce. Ijaz takes me to the Peshawar Swimming Club and a memory stirs. In the 50s, this was the centre of social life. Now the horseshoe bar, the largest in the world, has been removed. Peshawar is teetotal. \"The patient is alive but the pulse has gone,\" says one elderly member mournfully. Ijaz and I eventually discover my old home has become the dilapidated office of a gas company. Clerks follow me from room to room, enthusiastically shifting furniture. \"As you like?\" Ijaz asks anxiously, as if he can tailor the past to suit my needs. I nod. Everyone breaks into relieved smiles. The next morning we drive to Murree, a hill station near Kashmir, where I went to boarding school. Here, a magnificent figure in a fan-tailed turban introduces himself as Raja Umar Dad Khan. Umar is chief (raja) of a nearby village where each of his children has a house. In the evening dusk, he walks me to Pindi Point. The views are staggeringly beautiful; deep purple shadows creep across olive green valleys. \"Damn beautiful,\" he says. I spend a day at Umar's village. Head of the clan is his wife, Barbara, a magnificent matriarch not unlike that queen of Coronation Street, Elsie Tanner. She is ferocious, funny and has little time for Umar's sentimental affection for all things English. Barbara believes in Islam and arranged marriages (though her own, 40 years ago, was a love match), and watches closely as her subdued daughters-in-law - her domestic help - prepare lunch. Families like Umar's have to be monumentally industrious because corruption and poverty is rife. The average life expectancy for women is 50, for men 51. Electricity was supplied to the village a decade ago but \"the flush\" has yet to arrive. So several times a day the women carry on their heads tins of water from the well, each weighing many pounds. A 12-year-old can manage it; I can't. Despite the hardships, Barbara is adamant her life is better than mine. While in this part of Pakistan, the chances of a woman escaping an abusive family are practically nil, and honour killings of raped and adulterous women still occur, legally they are now banned. Barbara points out it is the very strictness of the code that offers women security and grants them seniority as they age - a respect denied women in the west. \"You can't have something for nothing,\" she argues equably. \"Your kind of freedom means everyday violence and women who are struggling alone, unprotected and unhappy.\" She doesn't change my mind, but she does make our lives appear less black and white, more different shades of grey. Barbara is half-English. Her father was a soldier who left after the war, promising to return. She has no inclination to visit the UK, she says. \"Why should I, when I have so many riches here?\" The day before my plane home, in a strange echo of my first visit to Pakistan, I find myself under siege. The tax imposed on travellers using the only road into Murree has been increased. Barricades appear, baton charges begin, shots are fired; only residents can move to and fro. Umar has a plan. He and his son will smuggle me out to Islamabad. I will take the veil and sit in the back of the car. \"And say bloody nothing,\" he insists in a tone that implies he believes this impossible. Several times we are stopped. When we finally arrive safely, Umar enjoys the irony. I arrived in his country as a feminist and leave as his number two wife. \"Bloody funny,\" he chuckles. \"My family is now your family,\" he adds graciously. \"You will come back.\" We both treat it not as a question but as a statement of fact. As happened to my father before me, Pakistan has stolen my heart.",

      "body": "<p>If you want to torpedo a new band before it has a chance to find its feet, all you have to do is describe it as a \"supergroup\". The term has become music business shorthand for \"accident waiting to happen\". The act is immediately saddled with an intolerable burden of anticipation. Rational discussion of its music and its prospects becomes impossible. </p> <p>The newest victim of supergroupism is R&amp;B trio Lucy Pearl. Comprising Raphael Saadiq, once of Tony Toni Tone, En Vogue refugee Dawn Robinson and A Tribe Called Quest's Ali Shaheed Muhammed, Lucy Pearl are gearing up to release their debut album, known merely as Lucy Pearl, on May 22. The so-called \"super-trio\" are being hailed by industry insiders for creating music which is forward-looking, while building on the members' past work. As for the name, Saadiq says, \"Our music has a loose sound and feeling, while what we're doing is something precious to us, like a pearl.\" </p> <p>With their previous success, the members are likely to be able to tap into a pre-existing R&amp;B, soul and hip hop fan base, but it may be their good fortune that none of the three is actually famous enough to merit the \"supergroup\" tag. The accolade of \"super\" should be earned by groups which contain at least one member recognisable to a broad constituency of listeners. In other words, a real supergroup needs a Will Smith or a Lauryn Hill - except they're doing such spectacular business as solo artists that the last thing they want to do is join a band and have to share out the accolades, and the dosh. Lucy Pearl's previous bands presented collective identities; with the exception perhaps of A Tribe Called Quest's Q-Tip, the various individual members were not household names.

      "bodyText": "If you want to torpedo a new band before it has a chance to find its feet, all you have to do is describe it as a \"supergroup\". The term has become music business shorthand for \"accident waiting to happen\". The act is immediately saddled with an intolerable burden of anticipation. Rational discussion of its music and its prospects becomes impossible. The newest victim of supergroupism is R&amp;B trio Lucy Pearl. Comprising Raphael Saadiq, once of Tony Toni Tone, En Vogue refugee Dawn Robinson and A Tribe Called Quest's Ali Shaheed Muhammed, Lucy Pearl are gearing up to release their debut album, known merely as Lucy Pearl, on May 22. The so-called \"super-trio\" are being hailed by industry insiders for creating music which is forward-looking, while building on the members' past work. As for the name, Saadiq says, \"Our music has a loose sound and feeling, while what we're doing is something precious to us, like a pearl.\" With their previous success, the members are likely to be able to tap into a pre-existing R&amp;B, soul and hip hop fan base, but it may be their good fortune that none of the three is actually famous enough to merit the \"supergroup\" tag. The accolade of \"super\" should be earned by groups which contain at least one member recognisable to a broad constituency of listeners. In other words, a real supergroup needs a Will Smith or a Lauryn Hill - except they're doing such spectacular business as solo artists that the last thing they want to do is join a band and have to share out the accolades, and the dosh. Lucy Pearl's previous bands presented collective identities; with the exception perhaps of A Tribe Called Quest's Q-Tip, the various individual members were not household names. Trying to elevate Lucy Pearl above their natural station smacks of an industry feverishly trying to clone some old-fashioned showbiz glamour. The current lack of available superstars has made the supergroup a rare phenomenon. The 80s saw the last great wave of pop megastardom, with the likes of Madonna, Wham!, Bon Jovi and Michael Jackson displaying awesome stadium-filling power; the 90s witnessed a steady decline in the numbers of this once-flourishing species. In the past few years, the industry has leaned increasingly towards the design and manufacture of interchangeable, indistinguishable boy- and girl-groups; the notion of the Great Solo Artist has become correspondingly irrelevant, successes such as Macy Gray unusual. Simultaneously, bands no longer become as famous as they used to (witness Oasis's failure to emulate the Beatles in the US), and they do not last as long. It is as if the splintered factions that now make up the pop audience don't respond so much to particular artists, but to generic trends where an act's identity is less important than the brand of music they perform, or the TV shows they feature in. The idea of rock star as Messiah burned brightest during the 60s, and that was when the concept of supergroup appeared. Blues-rock trio Cream could lay claim to being the first supergroup, featuring as it did Eric Clapton (already known as \"God\" thanks to his work with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers) alongside jazz drummer Ginger Baker and Manfred Mann's bassist Jack Bruce.

      "body": "<p>In the drab postwar London of demob suits and bomb craters, Minnette de Silva seemed as dazzling as a tropical bird. She arrived from Ceylon in 1945. Beautiful, sure of herself and wrapped in a pashmina-wool cloak against the cold, she was thrilled that, in spite of her parents' opposition, she had achieved her ambition to study at the Architectural Association. She was to become the first Sri Lankan woman architect and the first Asian woman Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. </p> <p>Contemporaries at the AA tend to remember her being followed about by a train of young men carrying her portfolio, drawing-board, bags and shawls. James Palmes, then the librarian at the RIBA, writes: \"Her visits to the library always caused a little flutter. She seemed to us, with her beflowered hair, bangles and glittering saris, like some fabled oriental princess.\" Minnette found herself a \"London nook\" in Savile Row, a cheap attic flat with black-out paper still stuck to the windows. She made friends with the architect Denys Lasdun, Henry Moore, Lawrence Durrell, Gielguds and Huxleys, Fitzrovian poets and actors. She also worked on the first exhibition of Indian art at the Royal Academy, and went to all the parties and ballets at Covent Garden. \"London seemed very small in those days,\" she said. But, most of all, she threw herself passionately into the world of progressive architecture, the propagation of modernism after the war. </p> <p>Minnette died two years ago, but she left behind a book called The Life and Work of an Asian Woman Architect, which brings her vividly back to life. It is a chaotic, exhilarating collage of memories, photographs - from Cartier Bresson to \"some of my old snapshots, better than nothing\" - letters, crumpled yellow newspaper cuttings, postcards, theatre programmes and architectural drawings. </p> <p>Both Minnette's argumentative radicalism and her social aplomb were, to some extent, family traits. Her father was a lawyer who made his children debate political issues at mealtimes. He was anti-imperialist, but by no means anti-western. He became one of the leaders of the National Movement in Ceylon and a minister in the first independent Sri Lankan government. Minnette's mother, who was of French and Dutch, as well as Sinhalese, ancestry, was a campaigner for women's rights. They were immensely hospitable and knew most of the radical politicians in Asia and Britain. As girls, Minnette and Indira Gandhi spent afternoons ironing each other's hair to straighten it, Lloyd George came to tea - \"he was surprised at my savoir-faire\" - and her sister, Marcia, was presented at court by, of all people, the Fabian socialist Beatrice Webb. </p> <p>In her generation, the boys in the family became lawyers or ambassadors, or ended up drinking 15 pink gins before lunch. The girls were the stars. Marcia, even better looking than Minnette, fled to Europe and worked in films, married three times, and wrote biographies and art history. </p> <p>Minnette's ambition to become an architect took hold in her teens, and she finally persuaded a rich uncle to finance her studies in Bombay. The only girl among 40 men, she says she was never teased, but she was expelled for taking part in a student strike over the arrest of Mahatma Gandhi. It turned out not to be a disaster. Her father finally agreed that she could go to Europe to study, and she was recommended to the RIBA by Lord Soulbury, who was in Ceylon on government business - \"I know a winner when I see one,\" he remarked. </p> <p>Throughout her life, Minnette attracted powerful men - though they often retreated briskly. \"She was hugely strong-willed and a tremendous flirt. She had immense charm,\" says her nephew, the QC Desmond de Silva, \"but she could be bossy and extremely difficult.\" Her most important conquest, and the person who most influenced her work, was the great architect Le Corbusier, whom she met when a friend took her to his studio in Paris. They met again at the International Congress of Modern Architects. \"He was,\" wrote Minnette, \"greatly attracted by his first live contact with 'l'Inde.' I think he romanticised our meeting... Since then, I have been deeply touched by his sympathy and interest in my work. His was an enduring, understanding friendship, pure and simple. At the time, I hardly realised the great honour.\" </p> <p>Le Corbusier wrote to her often, sketching buildings and people, signing his letters with a cartoon of a smiley crow and addressing her as \"small bird of the islands.\" He consulted her and sent her drawings, including one of a bizarre sexy shoe-shop he designed for Bally, elephant skin outside and satin within - \"une boutique tout a fait up to date.\" He invited her to stay in Chandrigar, and, best of all, he was genuinely interested in her work: \"Corb phoned to say bravo. He was the only one of my architectural friends who seemed to take a deep interest in my buildings,\" she said. </p> <p>In 1949, she returned to newly independent Sri Lanka, and set up the Studio of Modern Architecture in her parents' house. Kandy was to be her base for the rest of her life. Her first commissions were to build houses for friends of the family. She had lots of battles to fight. Contractors and builders were unused to taking orders from a woman, and could only be persuaded that her pioneering split-level structure would not fall straight down the hill when she called in the engineering firm Arup &amp; Partners. Cobras built nests in the foundations, so she sent for a snake charmer. The clients complained that everyone thought the house was a joke, but she won them round. Her houses were not the first modernist buildings on the island, but they were dashing rarities, utterly different in spirit from the usual neo-colonial, home counties half-timbering. </p> <p>Many photographs in the book record the tremendous vitality of her buildings. Inside and outside flow airily into each other. Pierced screens and balustrades filter the light, curly ironwork and fine columns cast shadows on the white reinforced concrete walls, staircases sweep round in elegant curves. Unpretentious, easy-going, full of joie de vivre, her houses look as if they must have been a huge pleasure to live in. Traditional Sri Lankan pots, fabrics and tiles look completely at home in their modernist interiors. </p> <p>From the outset, she insisted on the importance of incorporating the rich local tradition of arts and crafts into her buildings. She made a point of commissioning local potters, tile-makers and artists, and taught herself weaving in order to instruct craftsmen in the making of woven panels to divide rooms and cover ceilings. She later worked on housing for village communities, inexpensive blocks of flats, as well as houses for the new Sri Lankan professional classes, and, occasionally, public buildings like her (now dilapidated) elegant art centre in Kandy, which reinterpreted local building styles. </p> <p>\"She thought architecture morning, noon and night,\" says Ulrik Plesner, a Danish architect who worked for Minnette in the 50s, and later joined rival firms on the island. \"She was always hard up, always struggling, but she was a genuine reformer, very bold, very clear in her ideas. Technically, though, she didn't have a clue,\" he says, \"that was why she employed me. In Denmark, the training is very practical. But it never really mattered. In her drawings she tended to cover up the tricky technical bits with trees, and the local carpenters, builders and craftsmen were wonderful. They could make anything stay up. Sri Lankans were proud of her. In those days, not long after independence, they admired her British connections, too - going about with Larry Olivier cut ice then.\" </p> <p>When Kathy Stevenson, who now works for the Serpentine Gallery, went out to Sri Lanka in the early 90s to help Minnette sort out her daunting archives for the book - every postcard, every theatre ticket, every grocer's bill had been kept - she found a formidable old lady with a grand contralto voice, immaculately dressed as ever. Minnette still wore flowers in her hair, as she had when she first arrived in London. \"She had kept all her clothes since she was 15, and could still get into them.\" She still lived in her parents' crumbling old house high above Kandy. Pasted up on the hall walls were hundreds of photographs of friends who had stayed there during the past 70 years. One day, under a bed, Kathy found a box of love letters from David Lean, who had met Minnette when he was filming The Bridge on the River Kwai in Sri Lanka, and had wanted to marry her. Minnette sat up all night reading them for the last time, scoring through the passionate words with black ink as she read. </p> <p>\"Minnette felt her life had been a huge battle, pushing people, trying to get things done. She knew she could be impossible. She had three-day temper tantrums and locked herself in her room when she didn't get her own way. She shouted at her old servants. She pushed people hard, but she was pushing herself as well. In the end, you had to love her.\" Kathy found the best way of coping with her was to answer back. She boldly told her hostess that her bed was bumpy and uncomfortable. \"Well,\" said Minnette, \"Gandhi never complained.\"</p>",

Minnette still wore flowers in her hair, as she had when she first arrived in London. \"She had kept all her clothes since she was 15, and could still get into them.\" She still lived in her parents' crumbling old house high above Kandy. Pasted up on the hall walls were hundreds of photographs of friends who had stayed there during the past 70 years. One day, under a bed, Kathy found a box of love letters from David Lean, who had met Minnette when he was filming The Bridge on the River Kwai in Sri Lanka, and had wanted to marry her. Minnette sat up all night reading them for the last time, scoring through the passionate words with black ink as she read. \"Minnette felt her life had been a huge battle, pushing people, trying to get things done. She knew she could be impossible. She had three-day temper tantrums and locked herself in her room when she didn't get her own way. She shouted at her old servants. She pushed people hard, but she was pushing herself as well. In the end, you had to love her.\" Kathy found the best way of coping with her was to answer back. She boldly told her hostess that her bed was bumpy and uncomfortable. \"Well,\" said Minnette, \"Gandhi never complained.\"",

CBS suggested one snappy word: Dallas. Jacobs had two objections. He hadn't visualised the series being set there and - only 15 years after an American president had had his head blown open there - he felt that Dallas would lead viewers to expect a show about JFK. Jacobs suggested the title Oil, the commodity his feuding families dealt in. </p> <p>The studio won the naming game and now Dallas is one of the most famous titles in television history. Channel 4 is screening three hours of classic episodes and analysis to mark the 20th anniversary of the plot-line in which JR Ewing was shot. That single episode, more than any other programme, established the cultural power of television: its potential to hold a global audience in suspense. No history of the medium could be complete without serious consideration of Dallas. </p> <p>The one immutable rule of television is that great shows arise from their time. Dad's Army couldn't happen now because of the lack of actors, writers and viewers who remember the war. Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? would have been impossible before the National Lottery. </p> <p>Dallas too emerged from a narrow historical corridor. The David Jacobs show premiered on CBS in April 1978. In the second year of the Carter presidency, America was in economic crisis. The country's drivers - their gas limited by the actions of the OPEC group of oil-producing nations - engaged in angry confrontations at petrol stations. Dallas was a reassuring fantasy in which America controlled the world's oil. </p> <p>Dallas was also a reverie about extreme and conspicuous wealth, and it wasn't a coincidence that the show's greatest moments - the 1980 season in which JR was hot - coincided with the election campaign which led to the Reagan presidency. Money was becoming the profitable cultural subject of the time. </p> <p>There is also in the story of the Ewings an intriguing connection with an earlier presidency. Despite the professed fears of David Jacobs that viewers might take the title Dallas as a reference to the Kennedys, the series already seems to contain several others. Both the actual Boston clan and the fictional Dallas one have a senior son christened John but known by his initials and a junior one called Bobby. Both initialled heroes are shot in Dallas and taken to the same hospital. CBS encouraged this association by screening the episode in which JR's assailant was revealed (his sister-in-law, Kristin) on November 21, the eve of the Kennedy anniversary. </p> <p>These are all external explanations for the impact Dallas made. But there was a lot of internal cleverness. The Romeo And Juliet story is a reliably gripping plot, but Jacobs' twist was to make the star-crossed lovers - Bobby Ewing and Pam Barnes - relatively minor characters. This was the first mainstream serial in which the villain had been the central figure. At least one leading American TV actor refused to play JR Ewing on the basis that he was too unsympathetic. But Larry Hagman, who accepted, is credited with saying at rehearsal: \"He's the villain, but I'll play him as if he's the hero.\" Such moral ambiguity is now standard in TV drama but it was Jacobs and Hagman who kicked that door open. </p> <p>American audiences took Dallas seriously: as a kind of Tennessee Williams Lite. In Britain, the show was one of the first programmes to be watched ironically - a squint which most viewers now adopt routinely - by an audience which acknowledged it as being simultaneously gripping and ridiculous. The reputations of Terry Wogan as a broadcaster and Clive James as a television critic were made in part by their forensic demolition of this show. James noted how poor continuity made JR's hair change colour during scenes. Wogan pointed out that these super-rich tycoons all lived together in one small house and breakfasted by the pool in a wind so brisk that the actresses could be seen holding down their hair. </p> <p>What's perhaps hardest to realise now is how exotic these characters seemed to British audiences. Our soaps - in the Coronation Street tradition - showcased broke proles. This was a glamour soap, doubly exotic for being American. With Freddie Laker having tried but failed to make the USA available to the masses, the Atlantic was culturally still an ocean rather than the river it subsequently became. </p> <p>The series has now become shorthand for dramatic miscalculation - the later glossing of Bobby Ewing's death as a dream wrecked its reputation - but tonight's Channel 4 theme night should remind us that, early on, a much kinder assessment was merited.

Here it's Earl Spencer's address at Diana's funeral. Immensely irritatingly, we don't get his words in full - more focus is given to the ha'pennyworths of Eve Pollard, Andrew Morton and the paparazzi. But what we do see is as powerful as it was in 1997. David Dimbleby offers mild criticism, suggesting that the speech was emotional not rational; and rumours flew that Boris Johnson might have had a hand in its wording. Whatever. It was a knockout. </p> <p> <strong> My Best Friend's Wedding</strong><br> (PJ Hogan, 1997) <br> 10am &amp; 4.10pm, Sky Premier </p> <p>Fun-filled modern take on the screwball comedy that saw Julia Roberts, aka Erin Brockovich at a cinema near you, doing big box-office. She's a cookery writer who realises, four days before her ex (Dermot Mulroney) is to marry Cameron Diaz (pictured), that she is still in love with him. Luckily her gay colleague (Rupert Everett) is on hand to pose as her beau, in order to make said ex jealous (look, it's not meant to make much sense. That's why it's screwball). </p> <p><strong> The Name Of The Rose</strong><br> (Jean-Jacques Annaud, 1986) <br> 9pm, 2.45am, Carlton Cinema </p> <p>Medieval detective story adapted from Umberto Eco's novel about serial murder in a remote Italian monastery. Annaud seems in his element in the middle ages, directing with a real feel for a time that was both brutish and high-minded. And Sean Connery is superb as William of Baskerville who, aided by his little assistant Christian Slater, sets out to decipher the secret of the library, and outwit the saturnine F Murray Abraham's grand inquisitor. </p> <p><strong> Husbands</strong><br> (John Cassavetes, 1970) <br> 1.05am, FilmFour </p> <p>One of the great Cassavetes' free-form improvisations, a darkly comic affirmation of life in the face of death.
