Chelsea had gone into the game with much to prove, not least to their chairman. In his programme notes Ken Bates, with typical forthrightness, described the team's latest disappointing Premiership performance at home to Leicester on Saturday as \"'the worst display I have seen from a Chelsea team for many a year\". He didn't blame Vialli but the team - \"It doesn't matter how much talent a player has if he doesn't use it.\" In that context, this match offered a timely test of the application and commitment of Chelsea's highly paid squad. Forest have fallen on hard times since they contested a Uefa Cup quarter-final just four years ago, with the club's status eroded by financial problems and a revolving door in the manager's office. The club that Brian Clough built are currently fighting against relegation from the First Division and came into this tie with the worst away record of the 92 clubs. At Grimsby on Saturday, a game which saw two Forest players sent off and the assistant manager Dennis Booth escorted from the ground for insulting a policeman, the team notched up their seventh away defeat in a row.

      "bodyText": "The government suffered its first defeat at the hands of the partially-reformed House of Lords tonight, as peers wrecked home secretary Jack Straw's controversial plans to restrict the right to trial by jury. Tory and Liberal Democrat peers, supported by retired law lords and Labour rebels, voted by 222 to 126, a majority of 96, to pass amendments to the criminal justice (mode of trial) bill and restore the right of the accused to choose jury trial Lords Leader Baroness Jay said passing the amendment had \"effectively killed the bill\". \"As amended it no longer represents government policy,\" she said \"We will not proceed with this bill and will be introducing a no 2 bill in the Commons in the present session.\" Despite the eviction of most of the hereditaries in November, the political balance of the house is still weighted against the present government - 232 Tories and 54 Liberal Democrats against 181 Labour peers, with 161 crossbenchers and seven non-aligned peers - so the success of the committee stage amendment is not unexpected. Nevertheless the margin of defeat represents an embarrassment for the government, as the bill's opponents included a large number of Labour peers . The bill proposed to restrict the right to jury trial in so-called \"either-way\" cases - such as theft, burglary and handling - but with the right to appeal against a magistrates' court's decision to try the case. The government argues that this will save an estimated \u00a3105 million a year, partly in reduced prison sentences, and lessen the trauma for victims who have to wait longer for crown court jury trials than for JP hearings. The bill's critics argue that the change would fail to make the predicted savings, would be perceived as disadvantaging people from ethnic minorities, and would erode a judicial tradition dating from Magna Carta. In a heated Lords debate, Liberal Democrat Lord Dholakia said a \"crucial\" argument against the proposals was the effect on black and Asian defendants, particularly when Government research on the issue was so \"inadequate\". \"At a time when the criminal justice system needs to take every step it can to repair the confidence of racial minorities abolishing the right to elect jury trial is a step in precisely the opposite direction. Labour peer Baroness Kennedy said the bill's aims - to increase court efficiency and crack down on abusers - were laudable but admitted that she could not support it. \"The reason I oppose this bill and the reason I have supported this amendment, which I did with some pain in my heart, is because I think it is an issue of principle. \"I believe that the impact of this bill will be socially divisive and discriminatory ... and I think it does remove an important citizen's right.\" At the opening of the debate, Tory home affairs spokesman Lord Cope of Berkeley, asserted the peer's right to table an amendment. \"Some people seem to think that we, the House of Lords, should not pass this amendment because it is 'too important a matter',\" he said \"We are told we should stand back, hold our noses, and leave the decision to the House of Commons, that the elected house with its large government majority, fiercely controlled, should alone decide. \"But no one in the Commons was elected on the basis of the position in this bill. It formed no part of the Labour manifest. Indeed the Labour party were at that stage very strongly against the whole idea. \"If it came into any elector's consideration at the last election, Labour were elected to oppose this bill.\" He argued that the partly reformed House of Lords, comprising appointed peers and elected hereditaries, had the authority to vote down the bill. Lord Cope, a life peer and former MP, added: \"Perhaps in due course there will be a different second chamber in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile we must do our duty for which we were selected, and each of us must decide the issue and vote accordingly.\"",

      "trailText": "The issue explained",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>What is the House of Lords?</b> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld/ldhome.htm\" target=\"_new\">House of Lords</a> is one part of the <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/lords/Story/0,2763,96213,00.html\" target=\"_new\">ancient triumvirate</a> in the British constitution, which also includes the <a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">monarchy</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/HSECOM.HTM\" target=\"_new\">Commons</a>. Representing the interests of the aristocracy, the lords historically combined with the \"commoners\" to challenge and check the power of kings.</p> <p>These days, the Lords is the second legislative chamber in parliament, responsible for amending and scrutinising the activities of the government-dominated Commons. Other democratic countries have a similar institution, often known as an upper chamber or senate.</p> <p><b>Who are the members of the House of Lords?</b></p> <p>Where the Lords differs from other upper chambers is the presence of hereditary peers - lords who inherit their title from their fathers (or, less frequently, their mothers). The 1958 Life Peerages Act enabled the prime minister to appoint life peers, who hold their position for their lifetime but cannot hand it down to their heirs. These are known as \"day boys\" by the hereditaries; \"Tony's cronies\" by today's Tories. Also seated in the chamber are 26 bishops, reflecting the Church of England's role as the official state religion, and 12 law lords.</p> <p><b>What does the House of Lords do?</b></p> <p>Like other upper chambers, the Lords is part of the legislative process, scrutinising the work of the Commons and the government. Most major legislative bills are designed by the government and are debated in the Commons before coming to the Lords, which can propose amendments or delay non-financial legislation. The 12 law lords also act as the UK's final court of appeal.</p> <p><b>Why is Labour reforming the Lords?</b></p> <p>The House of Lords is widely condemned as undemocratic: \"one of the most curious of the curious anomalies in British public life, defying all logic of democratic and secular politics\", in the words of political scientist John Kingdom.</p> <p>The presence of an unelected upper chamber mocks the principle of a representative democracy, in which all people are equally entitled to participate in politics. The law lords can both make and judge the law: this runs counter to the democratic ideal of a \"separation of powers\", which holds that the judiciary (courts), legislature (parliament) and executive (government) should remain independent of each other, checking and balancing each other's power.</p> <p>Self-interest also plays a part in Labour's decision to reform the Lords. Dismantling the chamber enhances Labour's reformist credentials. More importantly, abolishing the hereditary peers removes a key source of Conservative opposition to the government. Predominantly Tory, the hereditary peers have fuelled a number of revolts against Labour's legislation, including major opposition to Labour's welfare plans last autumn.</p> <p><b>What can be done with the Lords?</b></p> <p>There are two main options. The first is to create an upper chamber which is subservient to the government, sustaining the British tradition of a dominant executive. A House of Lords wholly nominated by the prime minister would be the most extreme example of this. Opponents argue that this would perpetuate the undemocratic imbalance of power in British politics, which makes government an \"elective dictatorship\".</p> <p>The second option is to create a second chamber similar to those in other western democracies: a directly elected, independent body, designed to check and scrutinise the power of the government, with no overlapping of judicial or legislative functions. Tony Blair is among those who believe this would undermine the Commons and introduce gridlock into politics, threatening the speed and efficiency with which the government can act.</p> <p><b>What has Labour done so far?</b></p> <p>Labour's <a href=\"http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1999/19990034.htm\" target=\"_new\">House of Lords Act 1999</a> removed all but 92 hereditary peers last year. A further 10 were immediately granted life peerages by the prime minister, allowing them to stay in the Lords. Initially seeking the removal of all hereditary peers, Mr Blair was forced to approve this compromise before the Lords would approve his legislation. The new house first assembled for the Queen's speech on 17 November 1999.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/lords/Story/0,2763,100505,00.html\" target=\"_new\">92 hereditary peers</a> who remained were elected by their peers, after all published 75-word manifestos justifying their retention. Lord Onslow's manifesto read: \"It would be as vainglorious to proclaim a personal manifesto as it would be arrogant to list any permanent achievements.\" He was elected.</p> <p><b>What is the royal commission?</b></p> <p>The government has said reform will not stop here. But it has not decided what further changes to make to the Lords, which, by other countries' standards, is still absurdly undemocratic.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.lords-reform.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">royal commission</a>, chaired by Conservative peer <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/lords/Story/0,2763,124785,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Lord Wakeham</a>, was established in 1999 <a href=\"http://www.lords-reform.org.uk/index/terms.htm\" target=\"_new\">to consider and make recommendations on the role and functions of a second chamber</a>.

      "bodyText": "What is the House of Lords? The House of Lords is one part of the ancient triumvirate in the British constitution, which also includes the monarchy and the Commons. Representing the interests of the aristocracy, the lords historically combined with the \"commoners\" to challenge and check the power of kings. These days, the Lords is the second legislative chamber in parliament, responsible for amending and scrutinising the activities of the government-dominated Commons. Other democratic countries have a similar institution, often known as an upper chamber or senate. Who are the members of the House of Lords? Where the Lords differs from other upper chambers is the presence of hereditary peers - lords who inherit their title from their fathers (or, less frequently, their mothers). The 1958 Life Peerages Act enabled the prime minister to appoint life peers, who hold their position for their lifetime but cannot hand it down to their heirs. These are known as \"day boys\" by the hereditaries; \"Tony's cronies\" by today's Tories. Also seated in the chamber are 26 bishops, reflecting the Church of England's role as the official state religion, and 12 law lords. What does the House of Lords do? Like other upper chambers, the Lords is part of the legislative process, scrutinising the work of the Commons and the government. Most major legislative bills are designed by the government and are debated in the Commons before coming to the Lords, which can propose amendments or delay non-financial legislation. The 12 law lords also act as the UK's final court of appeal. Why is Labour reforming the Lords? The House of Lords is widely condemned as undemocratic: \"one of the most curious of the curious anomalies in British public life, defying all logic of democratic and secular politics\", in the words of political scientist John Kingdom. The presence of an unelected upper chamber mocks the principle of a representative democracy, in which all people are equally entitled to participate in politics. The law lords can both make and judge the law: this runs counter to the democratic ideal of a \"separation of powers\", which holds that the judiciary (courts), legislature (parliament) and executive (government) should remain independent of each other, checking and balancing each other's power. Self-interest also plays a part in Labour's decision to reform the Lords. Dismantling the chamber enhances Labour's reformist credentials. More importantly, abolishing the hereditary peers removes a key source of Conservative opposition to the government. Predominantly Tory, the hereditary peers have fuelled a number of revolts against Labour's legislation, including major opposition to Labour's welfare plans last autumn. What can be done with the Lords? There are two main options. The first is to create an upper chamber which is subservient to the government, sustaining the British tradition of a dominant executive. A House of Lords wholly nominated by the prime minister would be the most extreme example of this. Opponents argue that this would perpetuate the undemocratic imbalance of power in British politics, which makes government an \"elective dictatorship\". The second option is to create a second chamber similar to those in other western democracies: a directly elected, independent body, designed to check and scrutinise the power of the government, with no overlapping of judicial or legislative functions. Tony Blair is among those who believe this would undermine the Commons and introduce gridlock into politics, threatening the speed and efficiency with which the government can act. What has Labour done so far? Labour's House of Lords Act 1999 removed all but 92 hereditary peers last year. A further 10 were immediately granted life peerages by the prime minister, allowing them to stay in the Lords. Initially seeking the removal of all hereditary peers, Mr Blair was forced to approve this compromise before the Lords would approve his legislation. The new house first assembled for the Queen's speech on 17 November 1999. The 92 hereditary peers who remained were elected by their peers, after all published 75-word manifestos justifying their retention. Lord Onslow's manifesto read: \"It would be as vainglorious to proclaim a personal manifesto as it would be arrogant to list any permanent achievements.\" He was elected. What is the royal commission? The government has said reform will not stop here. But it has not decided what further changes to make to the Lords, which, by other countries' standards, is still absurdly undemocratic. A royal commission, chaired by Conservative peer Lord Wakeham, was established in 1999 to consider and make recommendations on the role and functions of a second chamber. It was supposed to report by the end of 1999, but disagreements among the academics and politicians who make up the body delayed its publication until now. Cynics observe that royal commissions are often used as tools of procrastination by governments wanting to be seen to be making reformist noises but unwilling to take legislative action. The highly respected Jenkins commission on electoral reform reported in November 1998, but the government has subsequently placed electoral reform at the bottom of its priorities. It is highly unlikely that Jenkins' recommendations will ever be adopted. What does the Wakeham commission recommend? Lord Wakeham's recommendations represent a compromise between government supporters, who wanted a fully-nominated chamber, and more radical reformists, who wanted a directly-elected second chamber. The commission recommends: \u0095 a significant minority of \"regional members\" chosen on a basis which reflects the views of the regional electorates; \u0095 a totally independent appointments system with a remit to bring in representatives from all sectors of society (rather than the present system of prime ministerial patronage); \u0095 a statutory minimum proportion (30%) of women; \u0095 fair representation for ethnic minority groups; \u0095 a broader range of religious representation. What the commission does not recommend is also significant. It fails to argue for a second chamber consisting wholly, or largely, of directly elected peers. What will happen next? Probably very little, although Lord Wakeham insists \"there is no sign\" that the government will abandon the reforms it started. The commission has offered a compromise but no clear lead. Guardian columnist Hugo Young believes that \"Labour leaders had given no thought to what should happen next. They were agents of gesture, not reform.\" That gesture - removing all but 92 hereditary peers - may be as revolutionary as parliamentary reform gets under the Blair government.

      "bodyText": "As soon as Robin Cook announced shortly after New Labour came to power that he would introduce an \"ethical dimension\" to foreign policy, Whitehall warned that his pledge would be a hostage to fortune. How could the world's second biggest arms exporter, with an industry officially estimated to sell more than \u00a35bn a year in weapons overseas, up to a quarter of the global market and employing 400,000, pursue a foreign policy where ethics played a part? And even less so when the most lucrative arms markets are countries with the most repressive regimes or engaged in conflicts. The government's election manifesto stated: \"We support a strong UK defence industry which is a strategic part of our industrial base as well as our defence effort\". Defence analysts said yesterday that the industry has such a strong lobbying power, it has managed to persuade Downing Street that Mr Cook's \"ethical dimension\" could be deleterious to an industry that helps UK manufacturing occupy a leading world position. The industry is dominated by BAE Systems, the giant formed from the \u00a38bn merger last year with GEC's Marconi defence arm and successful exporter of Hawk training aircraft to 12 countries, Harriers, Tornados and the like. But it comprises a host of smaller players such as Cobham, Hunting and GKN and is so attractive as a bridge between the US and Europe that it is now heavily courted by the Americans, French and Germans. BAE, through mammoth deals such as the Al Yamamah programme with Saudi Arabia actively endorsed by governments, carries enormous political clout, capable of relying on MPs of all parties, including Labour MPs in Lancashire, to pursue its interests. It is, says one analyst, exceptionally good at lobbying and senior executives spend as much time, if not more, in Whitehall as in the boardroom. Arms sales do not just help the balance of trade. They are seen as a boost for other exports, to help Britain \"punch above its weight\" - a favoured foreign office phrase - and keep the intelligence agencies in business. If Britain did not sell weapons, then its rivals would, argue the arms companies, the ministry of defence and the department of trade and industry. Now the government contends that if Britain did not continue to supply weapons to its traditional markets its customers would consider Britain unreliable - and turn to other countries. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Britain sold $9bn worth of arms in 1998, with the government approving export licences for a wide range of military equipment to Indonesia, Turkey, China, Bahrain, and Algeria, as well as Saudi Arabia, Britain's main arms customer. Sales included 38 armoured combat vehicles to Indonesia, 18 Tornado aircraft, 100 air-to-ground missiles to Saudi Arabia, and more than 400 air-launched missiles to the United Arab Emirates. The MoD and the arms industry argue that exports - which account for 40% of British weapons production - make unit costs for supplies to the British armed forces cheaper. Independent analysts say that government help in promoting arms exports - through the MoD's arms salesmen, hidden subsidies provided by export credit guarantees and publicly funded research and development - skews the manufacturing sector of the economy.

Political and trade union opponents have been beaten up. The government could be made to pay the price of its adventure in Congo in two critical ballots over the coming weeks. A referendum on a revised constitution which strengthens Mr Mugabe's powers is promised soon. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for March. The opposition believes that the war, economic crisis and general desperation at Mr Mugabe's rule offers it the best chance ever of overturning his parliamentary majority. Britain and the US have pressed Mr Mugabe to get his troops out of Congo. He would now like to do that. The government says it will bring half the soldiers home in time for the election in March. Zimbabwe hoped a peace accord signed in August would offer a face-saving way to bring the soldiers home and protect its investments, but the fighting continues. There is, perhaps, too much bitterness and suspicion, and a belief among some of Mr Kabila's enemies that Zimbabwe cannot keep up the fight for much longer.",

      "body": "<p>In the good old days, when people took lunchbreaks, and offices were round the corner from the high street instead of in an industrial wasteland, window shopping was a daily pleasure. We're having to learn a new way of doing it these days. Too rainy to go out? Too cold to stare through fogged-up shop fronts? Window shopping on the internet involves less wear and tear on shoe leather, can whizz you through London, Paris and New York before you've finished getting the spinach out of your teeth and, just like the real thing, usually ends up with you buying something you can't afford. </p> <p>You have to think time-killing: it's that swinging-your-shoe, what-shall-I-do-now feeling, when you know that anything, anything at all, is better than going back to work. Here's a guide to web-window licking for novices. </p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.audiostreet.com\">www.audiostreet.com</a> you can fiddle around for hours. The site sells thousands of albums (at some good discounts) and lets you play 30-second outtakes from most of them: I go through The Pixies, a bit of Abba and a couple of sweethearts by Van Morrison before being told to shut up by the rest of the office. </p> <p>Forced to move on, I next find my way to <a href=\"http://www.margherita2000.com\">www.margherita2000.com</a> which is run by Ariston. The company has come up with a washing machine to which you can send emails from work, once you've bought it and had it plumbed in - must be one of the greatest time-wasters ever. The cartoons are very sweet too. But you still have to get your flatmate or partner or dog to actually load the machine. </p> <p>A bit peckish, I meander to <a href=\"http://www.simplyfood.co.uk/chocolate\">www.simplyfood.co.uk/chocolate</a>, where, by pressing my thumb to the computer screen and clicking on Go, a bar of chocolate tells me what my chocolate levels are like. I am a disgrace to chocoholics, apparently, but don't know if that means I eat too much or too little. </p> <p>The site tries to tempt me to buy the chocolate tasting box (for \u00a314.95): 10 different kinds of chocolate so you can persuade yourself that instead of stuffing your face,you're educating your palate. Or get stuck into the comparison reviews (what is it about these things that is so interesting?): they've tried out organic tomato sauce, sushi boxes and smoked salmon. </p> <p>Feeling I should really elevate my mind from my stomach (where it usually is) I next visit <a href=\"http://www.ottakars.co.uk\">www.ottakars.co.uk</a>, a classy book site full of predictions, gossip and news, and a very tasteful selection of books. A bit too tasteful for me, in fact, and I scarper to <a href=\"http://www.dogdoo.com\">www.dogdoo.com</a>, a site I've heard of, but hadn't quite believed existed. For a few dollars, the site promises to send, anonymously of course, a box of dog turds to your worst enemy. It's worth visiting just to read the thank-you letters and recommendations. </p> <p>There should be a link between the dog poo site and <a href=\"http://www.gentlehints.com\">www.gentlehints.com</a> , a site which will anonymously notify colleagues, or friends, of personal hygiene problems, on your behalf, with a letter that starts: \"From someone who cares.\" Yuh! Right! Now feeling a little queasy, I drop into <a href=\"http://www.lucozade.com\">www.lucozade.com</a> for an instant boost: click on the designated spot, and a compliment flashes up. It tells me I'm looking great today. We like this site. (Or, for unreconstructed men, and there are plenty of you around, just leaf through the Lucozade gallery of Lara Croft pictures - schwing!)

      "bodyText": "In the good old days, when people took lunchbreaks, and offices were round the corner from the high street instead of in an industrial wasteland, window shopping was a daily pleasure. We're having to learn a new way of doing it these days. Too rainy to go out? Too cold to stare through fogged-up shop fronts? Window shopping on the internet involves less wear and tear on shoe leather, can whizz you through London, Paris and New York before you've finished getting the spinach out of your teeth and, just like the real thing, usually ends up with you buying something you can't afford. You have to think time-killing: it's that swinging-your-shoe, what-shall-I-do-now feeling, when you know that anything, anything at all, is better than going back to work. Here's a guide to web-window licking for novices. At www.audiostreet.com you can fiddle around for hours. The site sells thousands of albums (at some good discounts) and lets you play 30-second outtakes from most of them: I go through The Pixies, a bit of Abba and a couple of sweethearts by Van Morrison before being told to shut up by the rest of the office. Forced to move on, I next find my way to www.margherita2000.com which is run by Ariston. The company has come up with a washing machine to which you can send emails from work, once you've bought it and had it plumbed in - must be one of the greatest time-wasters ever. The cartoons are very sweet too. But you still have to get your flatmate or partner or dog to actually load the machine. A bit peckish, I meander to www.simplyfood.co.uk/chocolate, where, by pressing my thumb to the computer screen and clicking on Go, a bar of chocolate tells me what my chocolate levels are like. I am a disgrace to chocoholics, apparently, but don't know if that means I eat too much or too little. The site tries to tempt me to buy the chocolate tasting box (for \u00a314.95): 10 different kinds of chocolate so you can persuade yourself that instead of stuffing your face,you're educating your palate. Or get stuck into the comparison reviews (what is it about these things that is so interesting?): they've tried out organic tomato sauce, sushi boxes and smoked salmon. Feeling I should really elevate my mind from my stomach (where it usually is) I next visit www.ottakars.co.uk, a classy book site full of predictions, gossip and news, and a very tasteful selection of books. A bit too tasteful for me, in fact, and I scarper to www.dogdoo.com, a site I've heard of, but hadn't quite believed existed. For a few dollars, the site promises to send, anonymously of course, a box of dog turds to your worst enemy. It's worth visiting just to read the thank-you letters and recommendations. There should be a link between the dog poo site and www.gentlehints.com , a site which will anonymously notify colleagues, or friends, of personal hygiene problems, on your behalf, with a letter that starts: \"From someone who cares.\" Yuh! Right! Now feeling a little queasy, I drop into www.lucozade.com for an instant boost: click on the designated spot, and a compliment flashes up. It tells me I'm looking great today. We like this site. (Or, for unreconstructed men, and there are plenty of you around, just leaf through the Lucozade gallery of Lara Croft pictures - schwing!) In need of a genuine shopping, I stop off at www.ishouldbeworking.com which is a US site dedicated to \"slackers, goof-offs, procrastinators, loafers, long lunchers and web-addicted employees world wide\". I instantly feel right at home and am soon within cyberbreadths of buying a pair of emerald earrings ($119! How can that be wrong?). It's the offer of the week, along with a golfers' practice net. Suddenly I realise what I'm doing. I'll have to say no to the champagne and roses, too. Changing direction, I turn to www.hotbox.co.uk and find the boys' toys much easier to resist: it's no to the shot glass chess set (when you take your opponent's piece, you drink it) and to the bonsai tree, although I am extremely tempted by the remote-control flying saucer (\u00a364.95). How cool would that be? Bracing satire is what is needed and there's loads of it washing around this particular section of cyberspace place. The most famous is www.theonion.com with my favourite headline of all time: New Crispy Snack Cracker to Ease Crushing Pain of Modern Life. The web even manages to send itself up: www.losers.org has collected some of the worst sites together and categorised them. Joy. Pure joy, as long as your colleagues don't mind you laughing out loud and forcing them to stop working and come over to look. Whoops, I think I can see my editor coming. No, no, it's work. Honestly!

      "body": "<p><strong> 1</strong> Are you sitting comfortably? Start by getting the right seat at <a href=\"http://www.thechair.co.uk\">www.thechair.co.uk</a>, where you can zoom around and try out modern or classic designs. It has its own very good take on the much-imitated Arne Jacobsen chair Christine Keeler once famously perched on - it's called the Kite, and costs \u00a369. </p> <p><strong>2</strong> Put on your slippers. <a href=\"http://www.agentprovocateur.com\">www.agentprovocateur.com</a> can supply satin mules with maribou trim (\u00a355), as well as all sorts of expensive underwear. Practical they ain't - but then the company is run by Vivienne Westwood's son, and all you have to do with this kind of shopping is relax, sit back and enjoy it. </p> <p><strong>3</strong> Fix yourself a drink, courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.berry-bros.co.uk\">www.berry-bros.co.uk</a>, one of Britain's oldest and most traditional wine merchants, yet also one of the quickest off the mark to set up a comprehensive website. Scan its bestsellers list for a quaffable merlot Domaine d'Antugnac at \u00a34.95. </p> <p><strong>4</strong> If you're feeling flush, you'll enjoy <a href=\"http://www.amivin.com\">www.amivin.com</a>'s interpretation of everyday wines \"all under \u00a311.75\". This site gives a guarantee that its prices won't be beaten, and the Errazuriz Sauvignon Blanc at \u00a35.49 goes down a treat. </p> <p><strong>5</strong> Get yourself a personal organiser so that you can store these web addresses and browse and shop on the bus on the way to work. The Psion Series 7 is about as clever as personal organisers get. As well as standard PC-type applications (word processor, spreadsheet), it has a web browser, email and is the first Psion to have a colour screen. It's available from <a href=\"http://www.insight.com/uk/\">www.insight.com/uk/</a> at \u00a3657.99. </p> <p><strong>6</strong> Rather cheaper is the Psion Revo, selling for \u00a3214.99 at the good computer and electronics site <a href=\"http://www.microwarehouse.co.uk\">www.microwarehouse.co.uk</a>. The Revo doesn't come with a colour screen, but it will send and receive email if you connect it up to a mobile phone with an infrared port. </p> <p><strong>7</strong> Book your entertainment for later. <a href=\"http://www.odeon.com\">www.odeon.com</a> has listings for many of its cinemas and you can order your tickets online. Why not check out Angela's Ashes? </p> <p><strong>8</strong> Staying in? <a href=\"http://www.blackstar.co.uk\">www.blackstar.co.uk</a> is one of the best sites for videos and DVDs. In case you missed what everyone's been talking about, the video of Ali G Innit is \u00a314.39, and has the best bits from his TV interviews and some footage never broadcast. </p> <p><strong>9</strong> Line up some food, in case you get carried away by your cybershopping and find it's closing time when you resurface. Sign up for a weekly order of organic fruit and vegetables at <a href=\"http://www.organicsdirect.co.uk\">www.organicsdirect.co.uk</a>. Don't be put off by the whole-foody nutloaf design on this site, just enjoy knowing you will be supporting small local producers. A standard vegetable box is \u00a314.95. The bread is good too - no arguments about whether fresh means fresh or reheated or half-baked here. </p> <p><strong>10</strong> <a href=\"http://www.iceland.co.uk\">www.iceland.co.uk</a> has won the race to be the first major retailer offering online shopping nationwide. It was also the first to take a stand against GM foods. Get it to bring a chicken tikka or a week's supply of fish fingers to your door. (If you are on a Mac, you have to use Netscape Navigator.) </p> <p><strong>11</strong> If you live in the right postcode, take advantage of Tesco's efforts to fight back against Asda by cutting its prices. <a href=\"http://www.tescodirect.com\">www.tescodirect.com</a> can provide you with a van of food and wine fit for the Queen, (or was it the Queen's servants?), and will probably be cheaper than your local supermarket, despite the \u00a35 delivery charge. </p> <p><strong>12</strong> For a treat, sample some Lakeland organic trout from Hawkshead, at <a href=\"http://www.edirectory.co.uk/organicfish\">www.edirectory.co.uk/organicfish</a>. It will arrive the next day fresher than the average fish counter offerings. It's just \u00a32.00 for a 392g fish, but with a hefty \u00a38.50 delivery charge, you'll need to order in bulk to make it worthwhile. </p> <p><strong>13</strong> For meat, <a href=\"http://www.richardwoodall.co.uk\">www.richardwoodall.co.uk</a> is hard to beat. This company's ham has been served not only to the Queen but also to travellers on Concorde and, less encouragingly, to passengers on the Titanic. Smoked home-cured bacon is a great last meal at \u00a33.34 for a 500g pack. </p> <p><strong>14</strong> <a href=\"http://www.realmeat.co.uk\">www.realmeat.co.uk</a> is also excellent and has a wider range. </p> <p><strong>15</strong> Wonderful olive oils are among the range of delicatessen produce available at <a href=\"http://www.morel.co.uk\">www.morel.co.uk</a>. The French everyday olive oil comes in a beautiful 1 litre tin costing \u00a36.90. </p> <p><strong>16</strong> More delicatessen goodies - as well as delicious bread - can be found at <a href=\"http://www.villagebakery.com\">www.villagebakery.com</a> . </p> <p><strong>17</strong> Once the provisioning has been done, you can settle down for some serious spending. Nervous about the phone bill? Go to <a href=\"http://www.bt.com\">www.bt.com</a> to change your friends and family discounted numbers. Your chosen \"best friend\" number (which receives a 15% discount) will, of course, be your internet dial-up number. </p> <p><strong>18</strong> Some things are meant to be expensive. <a href=\"http://www.ifexonline.co.uk\">www.ifexonline.co.uk</a> will do you a nice Le Corbusier sofa for \u00a31,200. This site is a vast catalogue of everything from beds to broom cupboards, all top of the range, utterly desirable and liable to break the bank. Tiny pictures prevent excessive salivation. </p> <p><strong>19</strong> For cheaper cupboards, filing boxes, shoe racks, and all the accessories that would help you organise your life if only you were that kind of person, go to <a href=\"http://www.theholdingcompany.co.uk\">www.theholdingcompany.co.uk</a>. A zinc doctor's cupboard (\u00a3220) could restore you. The owner of the site, being American, is light years ahead of most when it comes to efficient online ordering services. </p> <p><strong>20</strong> Plain, sensible and affordable is <a href=\"http://www.mccord.uk.com\">www.mccord.uk.com</a>, where a white shag-pile carpet starts at \u00a319.99. Just remember it's called a Flokati rug now. </p> <p><strong>21</strong> For an affordable yet collectible piece of modern design, look at Ella Doran's table mats, \u00a329.50 for six on <a href=\"http://www.bluedeco.com\">www.bluedeco.com</a>. </p> <p><strong>22</strong> Bag a bit of design history by visiting the second-hand designer furniture shop <a href=\"http://www.eatmyhandbagbitch.co.uk\">www.eatmyhandbagbitch.co.uk</a> for a System 1-2-3 Armchair by Verner Panton, great condition, a snip at \u00a3750 (that Panton exhibition at the Design Museum last year did wonders for prices, wouldn't you know), or an Eero Saarinen tulip chair at \u00a3225. (Online browsing, email ordering.) </p> <p><strong>23</strong> The self-respecting kitchen is supposed to have a Dualit toaster these days. The assembler's individual mark is on the base plate, and they are even made from the same heat-proof material as used in the space shuttle (nothing being too good to launch your day). You can read all about them at <a href=\"http://www.dualit.com\">www.dualit.com</a>, then buy one cheap at <a href=\"http://www.ogormans.co.uk\">www.ogormans.co.uk</a> (from \u00a3100 for a two-slicer, to \u00a3250 for a four-slice sandwich). </p> <p><strong>24</strong> \"We won't be beaten on price\" is the kind of reassurance canny shoppers like to hear, especially if they have an extravagance in mind such as a stylish Smeg fridge. <a href=\"http://www.electric-shop.co.uk\">www.electric-shop.co.uk</a> makes such a promise and of the three Smegs listed, prices start at \u00a3659 for the FC 36RX stainless steel model. </p> <p><strong>25</strong> The site above doesn't list Smeg's retro Fab 32 but you can find one at <a href=\"http://www.fhm.co.uk/shop/\">www.fhm.co.uk/shop/</a>, the online outpost of the magazine. The FHM lads seem an unlikely target for such a fridge but the price is good (\u00a31,130). Must be its curves, and its lager-holding capacity. </p> <p><strong>26</strong> <a href=\"http://www.value-direct.co.uk\">www.value-direct.co.uk</a> is another site confident about its pricing. It offers refunds of 110% if you can find the same product cheaper elsewhere, including delivery. This, then, is the place to buy that Dyson vacuum cleaner you've always promised yourself. The stylish no-bag, no-loss-of-suction De Stijl DC04 machine costs \u00a3238.95 (UK delivery is free). </p> <p><strong>27</strong> After all this bargain hunting, time for a splurge. The Cross in Notting Hill is one of the fashion crowd's favourite shops. Set up by Sam Robinson and Sarah Keen, whose friends have handy names like Jemima Khan and Jade Jagger, it sells an eclectic mix of clothes, and things for children and the home. Be tempted by Megan Park's hand-embroidered silk sarong skirt (\u00a3325) at <a href=\"http://www.thecrosscatalogue.com\">www.www.thecrosscatalogue.com</a>, or settle for flower flip-flops at \u00a330. Assuage your guilt by buying something for someone else, a teddy bear with heart, say (\u00a322). </p> <p><strong>28</strong> Stella McCartney, with her Chloe label, is next season's guest designer at La Redoute, a French mail-order catalogue that has gone online at <a href=\"http://www.redoute.co.uk\">www.redoute.co.uk</a> . It is one of the best for affordable but stylish interpretations of designer fashion. Already on the site is a range by Joseph: long flared skirt, \u00a344.99; trousers, \u00a344.99. McCartney's bosses are threatening to make you get a catalogue before you can order the Chloe dress, though (try emailing a request). </p> <p><strong>29</strong> For more designer gear, there's <a href=\"http://www.ghost.co.uk\">www.ghost.co.uk</a>, whose site sells a limited range of its classics (including the straight pant in viscose, \u00a381, and the cowl camisole, \u00a372). </p> <p><strong>30</strong> <a href=\"http://www.diesel.co.uk\">www.diesel.co.uk</a> has a funky site with the latest streetwear. Its Luster jean (\u00a360) promises to \"give delightful female calf muscles just the respect they deserve\". Men can buy the Diesel logo on their workwear pants for a mere \u00a370. </p> <p><strong>31</strong> <a href=\"http://www.boo.com\">www.boo.com</a> also has a great range of urban wear, and the latest in website design.

It has a deal with M&amp;S financial services to arrange finance, and delivers direct to your door. So far it can offer Ford, Audi/Volkswagen, Peugeot, Rover and Vauxhall/Opel, but eventually it hopes to sell all models and promises mouthwatering discounts. </p> <p><strong>35</strong> Carphone Ware- house's website, <a href=\"http://www.carphonewarehouse.com\">www.carphonewarehouse.com</a> may not be the easiest to navigate, but the company does promise to refund 110% if you find a phone cheaper elsewhere, and will even monitor prices (and refund the difference with a voucher) three months after your purchase. Order online and its 48-hour delivery service is free, making it the best place to buy Ericsson's dinky and highly desirable new T28 phone (\u00a3249.99), the teenagers' must-have, an Ericsson Chatboard (\u00a319.99) or Nokia's 7110 phone (\u00a3129.99). The Nokia is, so far, the only WAP (wireless application protocol) on the market, allowing you to access a simplified, no-picture version of the internet and send and receive emails. Stock can be a problem on the Nokia. </p> <p><strong>36</strong> The term \"MP3\" is the most searched on the internet, even more than \"sex\", which is saying something. But then MP3 is the technology that is threatening to put the music industry out of business.

      "bodyText": "1 Are you sitting comfortably? Start by getting the right seat at www.thechair.co.uk, where you can zoom around and try out modern or classic designs. It has its own very good take on the much-imitated Arne Jacobsen chair Christine Keeler once famously perched on - it's called the Kite, and costs \u00a369. 2 Put on your slippers. www.agentprovocateur.com can supply satin mules with maribou trim (\u00a355), as well as all sorts of expensive underwear. Practical they ain't - but then the company is run by Vivienne Westwood's son, and all you have to do with this kind of shopping is relax, sit back and enjoy it. 3 Fix yourself a drink, courtesy of www.berry-bros.co.uk, one of Britain's oldest and most traditional wine merchants, yet also one of the quickest off the mark to set up a comprehensive website. Scan its bestsellers list for a quaffable merlot Domaine d'Antugnac at \u00a34.95. 4 If you're feeling flush, you'll enjoy www.amivin.com's interpretation of everyday wines \"all under \u00a311.75\". This site gives a guarantee that its prices won't be beaten, and the Errazuriz Sauvignon Blanc at \u00a35.49 goes down a treat. 5 Get yourself a personal organiser so that you can store these web addresses and browse and shop on the bus on the way to work. The Psion Series 7 is about as clever as personal organisers get. As well as standard PC-type applications (word processor, spreadsheet), it has a web browser, email and is the first Psion to have a colour screen. It's available from www.insight.com/uk/ at \u00a3657.99. 6 Rather cheaper is the Psion Revo, selling for \u00a3214.99 at the good computer and electronics site www.microwarehouse.co.uk. The Revo doesn't come with a colour screen, but it will send and receive email if you connect it up to a mobile phone with an infrared port. 7 Book your entertainment for later. www.odeon.com has listings for many of its cinemas and you can order your tickets online. Why not check out Angela's Ashes? 8 Staying in? www.blackstar.co.uk is one of the best sites for videos and DVDs. In case you missed what everyone's been talking about, the video of Ali G Innit is \u00a314.39, and has the best bits from his TV interviews and some footage never broadcast. 9 Line up some food, in case you get carried away by your cybershopping and find it's closing time when you resurface. Sign up for a weekly order of organic fruit and vegetables at www.organicsdirect.co.uk. Don't be put off by the whole-foody nutloaf design on this site, just enjoy knowing you will be supporting small local producers. A standard vegetable box is \u00a314.95. The bread is good too - no arguments about whether fresh means fresh or reheated or half-baked here. 10 www.iceland.co.uk has won the race to be the first major retailer offering online shopping nationwide. It was also the first to take a stand against GM foods. Get it to bring a chicken tikka or a week's supply of fish fingers to your door. (If you are on a Mac, you have to use Netscape Navigator.) 11 If you live in the right postcode, take advantage of Tesco's efforts to fight back against Asda by cutting its prices. www.tescodirect.com can provide you with a van of food and wine fit for the Queen, (or was it the Queen's servants?), and will probably be cheaper than your local supermarket, despite the \u00a35 delivery charge. 12 For a treat, sample some Lakeland organic trout from Hawkshead, at www.edirectory.co.uk/organicfish. It will arrive the next day fresher than the average fish counter offerings. It's just \u00a32.00 for a 392g fish, but with a hefty \u00a38.50 delivery charge, you'll need to order in bulk to make it worthwhile. 13 For meat, www.richardwoodall.co.uk is hard to beat. This company's ham has been served not only to the Queen but also to travellers on Concorde and, less encouragingly, to passengers on the Titanic. Smoked home-cured bacon is a great last meal at \u00a33.34 for a 500g pack. 14 www.realmeat.co.uk is also excellent and has a wider range. 15 Wonderful olive oils are among the range of delicatessen produce available at www.morel.co.uk. The French everyday olive oil comes in a beautiful 1 litre tin costing \u00a36.90. 16 More delicatessen goodies - as well as delicious bread - can be found at www.villagebakery.com . 17 Once the provisioning has been done, you can settle down for some serious spending. Nervous about the phone bill? Go to www.bt.com to change your friends and family discounted numbers. Your chosen \"best friend\" number (which receives a 15% discount) will, of course, be your internet dial-up number. 18 Some things are meant to be expensive. www.ifexonline.co.uk will do you a nice Le Corbusier sofa for \u00a31,200. This site is a vast catalogue of everything from beds to broom cupboards, all top of the range, utterly desirable and liable to break the bank. Tiny pictures prevent excessive salivation. 19 For cheaper cupboards, filing boxes, shoe racks, and all the accessories that would help you organise your life if only you were that kind of person, go to www.theholdingcompany.co.uk. A zinc doctor's cupboard (\u00a3220) could restore you. The owner of the site, being American, is light years ahead of most when it comes to efficient online ordering services. 20 Plain, sensible and affordable is www.mccord.uk.com, where a white shag-pile carpet starts at \u00a319.99. Just remember it's called a Flokati rug now. 21 For an affordable yet collectible piece of modern design, look at Ella Doran's table mats, \u00a329.50 for six on www.bluedeco.com. 22 Bag a bit of design history by visiting the second-hand designer furniture shop www.eatmyhandbagbitch.co.uk for a System 1-2-3 Armchair by Verner Panton, great condition, a snip at \u00a3750 (that Panton exhibition at the Design Museum last year did wonders for prices, wouldn't you know), or an Eero Saarinen tulip chair at \u00a3225. (Online browsing, email ordering.) 23 The self-respecting kitchen is supposed to have a Dualit toaster these days. The assembler's individual mark is on the base plate, and they are even made from the same heat-proof material as used in the space shuttle (nothing being too good to launch your day). You can read all about them at www.dualit.com, then buy one cheap at www.ogormans.co.uk (from \u00a3100 for a two-slicer, to \u00a3250 for a four-slice sandwich). 24 \"We won't be beaten on price\" is the kind of reassurance canny shoppers like to hear, especially if they have an extravagance in mind such as a stylish Smeg fridge. www.electric-shop.co.uk makes such a promise and of the three Smegs listed, prices start at \u00a3659 for the FC 36RX stainless steel model. 25 The site above doesn't list Smeg's retro Fab 32 but you can find one at www.fhm.co.uk/shop/, the online outpost of the magazine. The FHM lads seem an unlikely target for such a fridge but the price is good (\u00a31,130). Must be its curves, and its lager-holding capacity. 26 www.value-direct.co.uk is another site confident about its pricing. It offers refunds of 110% if you can find the same product cheaper elsewhere, including delivery. This, then, is the place to buy that Dyson vacuum cleaner you've always promised yourself. The stylish no-bag, no-loss-of-suction De Stijl DC04 machine costs \u00a3238.95 (UK delivery is free). 27 After all this bargain hunting, time for a splurge. The Cross in Notting Hill is one of the fashion crowd's favourite shops. Set up by Sam Robinson and Sarah Keen, whose friends have handy names like Jemima Khan and Jade Jagger, it sells an eclectic mix of clothes, and things for children and the home. Be tempted by Megan Park's hand-embroidered silk sarong skirt (\u00a3325) at www.www.thecrosscatalogue.com, or settle for flower flip-flops at \u00a330. Assuage your guilt by buying something for someone else, a teddy bear with heart, say (\u00a322). 28 Stella McCartney, with her Chloe label, is next season's guest designer at La Redoute, a French mail-order catalogue that has gone online at www.redoute.co.uk . It is one of the best for affordable but stylish interpretations of designer fashion. Already on the site is a range by Joseph: long flared skirt, \u00a344.99; trousers, \u00a344.99. McCartney's bosses are threatening to make you get a catalogue before you can order the Chloe dress, though (try emailing a request). 29 For more designer gear, there's www.ghost.co.uk, whose site sells a limited range of its classics (including the straight pant in viscose, \u00a381, and the cowl camisole, \u00a372). 30 www.diesel.co.uk has a funky site with the latest streetwear. Its Luster jean (\u00a360) promises to \"give delightful female calf muscles just the respect they deserve\". Men can buy the Diesel logo on their workwear pants for a mere \u00a370. 31 www.boo.com also has a great range of urban wear, and the latest in website design. It is especially hot on trainers, with labels such as DKNY, Acupuncture and Jil Sander, but unforgiveably hasn't been set up for Mac users. 32 For reliable everyday clothes for adults and children, www.boden.co.uk has a good online catalogue and seems to have recovered from its Christmas blips. 33 If the funds are falling a little low, time to have a flutter at the online bookmakers www.bluesq.com. 34 Plan to make some serious savings on your next car by visiting www.oneswoop.com . Selling starts on March 1, but you can register now. It is dedicated to using the net to overcome the rip-off dealer network that has forced UK drivers to pay over the odds for their cars. It has a deal with M&amp;S financial services to arrange finance, and delivers direct to your door. So far it can offer Ford, Audi/Volkswagen, Peugeot, Rover and Vauxhall/Opel, but eventually it hopes to sell all models and promises mouthwatering discounts. 35 Carphone Ware- house's website, www.carphonewarehouse.com may not be the easiest to navigate, but the company does promise to refund 110% if you find a phone cheaper elsewhere, and will even monitor prices (and refund the difference with a voucher) three months after your purchase. Order online and its 48-hour delivery service is free, making it the best place to buy Ericsson's dinky and highly desirable new T28 phone (\u00a3249.99), the teenagers' must-have, an Ericsson Chatboard (\u00a319.99) or Nokia's 7110 phone (\u00a3129.99). The Nokia is, so far, the only WAP (wireless application protocol) on the market, allowing you to access a simplified, no-picture version of the internet and send and receive emails. Stock can be a problem on the Nokia. 36 The term \"MP3\" is the most searched on the internet, even more than \"sex\", which is saying something.

The \"French country hand-tied posy\" is \u00a335.50 including delivery. 40 Feeling lost?

You can order Durex here too (too late, too late). 43 Even cheaper still, tell them to make do with finger bikes - the latest playground craze.

      "body": "<p>WG \"Max\" Sebald is sometimes compared with Kafka. His fictions - if they are fictions - are unpindownable - but, if we are to believe the critics, they are unputdownable, too. </p> <p>He is perhaps the most often praised contemporary author (the laudatory quotes in the paperback of his second book, The Rings of Saturn, run to four pages), yet he is the antithesis of the much-hyped modern author. He has lived in the UK for 30 years, but still writes in his native German. (His books are translated by Michael Hulse with what all agree is extraordinary delicacy.) He teaches German literature at the University of East Anglia and rarely gives interviews, and is about as far removed from the London literary scene as it is possible for an author to be. </p> <p> Sebald is elusive and enigmatic, and so are his books. Typically, his latest, Vertigo (Harvill, \u00a312), is actually his earliest, written before The Emigrants and The Rings of Saturn, and published now in the wake of the critical (and, encouragingly, commercial) success of those two books. While weaker than the other parts of what is in effect a trilogy, the critical consensus is that it is still rather wonderful. But what is it about? </p> <p>That's where criticism proves a somewhat blunt instrument in describing Sebald's curious mix of travelogue, literary essay, philosophical reflection and fictive exploration. William Sutcliffe blathered splendidly in the Independent on Sunday: \"The very mysteriousness of the status of his text is central to his point ... Without ever explicitly saying so, Sebald is writing about the nature of truth, about the fictionality of biography, and the biographical nature of fiction ... Sebald is a writer of ideas and yet he never says what his ideas are. It is in what is missing, what is unsaid, that the meat of Sebald's writing lies.\"</p> <p>Got that? Sutcliffe, at the end of a longish piece, was left simultaneously gasping for breath and clutching at straws: \"In my experience, one's reflections sometimes run aground before discerning any particular meaning. Nonetheless, it is always worth the attempt.\" </p> <p> Claire Harman, in the Evening Standard, was more coherent but equally nonplussed: \"Vertigo is a cerebral novel which tests the limits of the form even further than its two successors and hangs together by the frailest threads. Observations, anecdotes and memories free-float in the narrator's nervous imagination; signs and symbols, like the doppelganger and the huntsman, dates and gestures, recur with secret significance - or not - from which the reader is deliberately excluded ... This technique is disarming, not least because it encourages your own mind to wander; you have to keep backtracking to re-establish yourself in the flow. However, it is peculiarly appropriate to the process of disintegration and breakdown which the narrator is trying to replicate as well as recall.\"</p> <p> \"The psychoanalyst Adam Phillips once praised writers who 'allow themselves to be a bit weird',\" wrote Alain de Botton in the Sunday Telegraph, \"and Sebald is certainly one of these. There seem to be no logical connections between the various parts of Vertigo, and yet the disunity and digressions add up to a faintly pleasing whole. One is afforded a sense of the unusual connections that can occur in the mind. Also, Sebald manages never to be boring. He infuses his prose with the tension of a stylish thriller; the narrator is constantly racing from one location to another in an escape from his demons, and this atmosphere of paranoia keeps us turning the pages.\"</p> <p> The most illuminating review was A S Byatt's in the Sunday Times. \"Sebald's subject is memory, its tenacity and fallibility,\" she explained. \"The conscious identity of an individual is his personal memories, and the integrity of his body inside his skin. History and literature are the memories of peoples and cultures, held together by languages and records. Thomas Hobbes in the 17th century remarked that imagination was nothing else but decayed memory. Sebald's great contribution to the fictive study of memory is to study it at the point of decay, of feverish imagining, of inventive wildness. His dogged, apparently random wanderings, from country to country and encounter to encounter, have a manic precision. He records tiny conversations, describes carefully the strangers he briefly travels with. He gives maps and timetables. He appears to be holding himself together with his writing.\"</p> <p> Erica Wagner, in the Times, also stressed the ever-present danger of disintegration: \"The book's title is perfect; it is a work that teeters at the edge of uncertainty ... Sebald's journey into himself and his past is compelling, puzzling, unique. Perhaps Harvill should abandon their current attempt at classifying Sebald and settle simply for 'metaphysics'.\" </p> <p>Vertigo, then, is strange, baffling, and almost uncategorisable - but it is a must-read, or perhaps a must-try-to.</p>",

He has lived in the UK for 30 years, but still writes in his native German. (His books are translated by Michael Hulse with what all agree is extraordinary delicacy.) He teaches German literature at the University of East Anglia and rarely gives interviews, and is about as far removed from the London literary scene as it is possible for an author to be. Sebald is elusive and enigmatic, and so are his books. Typically, his latest, Vertigo (Harvill, \u00a312), is actually his earliest, written before The Emigrants and The Rings of Saturn, and published now in the wake of the critical (and, encouragingly, commercial) success of those two books. While weaker than the other parts of what is in effect a trilogy, the critical consensus is that it is still rather wonderful. But what is it about? That's where criticism proves a somewhat blunt instrument in describing Sebald's curious mix of travelogue, literary essay, philosophical reflection and fictive exploration. William Sutcliffe blathered splendidly in the Independent on Sunday: \"The very mysteriousness of the status of his text is central to his point ... Without ever explicitly saying so, Sebald is writing about the nature of truth, about the fictionality of biography, and the biographical nature of fiction ... Sebald is a writer of ideas and yet he never says what his ideas are. It is in what is missing, what is unsaid, that the meat of Sebald's writing lies.\" Got that? Sutcliffe, at the end of a longish piece, was left simultaneously gasping for breath and clutching at straws: \"In my experience, one's reflections sometimes run aground before discerning any particular meaning. Nonetheless, it is always worth the attempt.\" Claire Harman, in the Evening Standard, was more coherent but equally nonplussed: \"Vertigo is a cerebral novel which tests the limits of the form even further than its two successors and hangs together by the frailest threads. Observations, anecdotes and memories free-float in the narrator's nervous imagination; signs and symbols, like the doppelganger and the huntsman, dates and gestures, recur with secret significance - or not - from which the reader is deliberately excluded ... This technique is disarming, not least because it encourages your own mind to wander; you have to keep backtracking to re-establish yourself in the flow. However, it is peculiarly appropriate to the process of disintegration and breakdown which the narrator is trying to replicate as well as recall.\" \"The psychoanalyst Adam Phillips once praised writers who 'allow themselves to be a bit weird',\" wrote Alain de Botton in the Sunday Telegraph, \"and Sebald is certainly one of these. There seem to be no logical connections between the various parts of Vertigo, and yet the disunity and digressions add up to a faintly pleasing whole. One is afforded a sense of the unusual connections that can occur in the mind. Also, Sebald manages never to be boring. He infuses his prose with the tension of a stylish thriller; the narrator is constantly racing from one location to another in an escape from his demons, and this atmosphere of paranoia keeps us turning the pages.\" The most illuminating review was A S Byatt's in the Sunday Times. \"Sebald's subject is memory, its tenacity and fallibility,\" she explained. \"The conscious identity of an individual is his personal memories, and the integrity of his body inside his skin. History and literature are the memories of peoples and cultures, held together by languages and records. Thomas Hobbes in the 17th century remarked that imagination was nothing else but decayed memory. Sebald's great contribution to the fictive study of memory is to study it at the point of decay, of feverish imagining, of inventive wildness. His dogged, apparently random wanderings, from country to country and encounter to encounter, have a manic precision. He records tiny conversations, describes carefully the strangers he briefly travels with. He gives maps and timetables. He appears to be holding himself together with his writing.\" Erica Wagner, in the Times, also stressed the ever-present danger of disintegration: \"The book's title is perfect; it is a work that teeters at the edge of uncertainty ... Sebald's journey into himself and his past is compelling, puzzling, unique. Perhaps Harvill should abandon their current attempt at classifying Sebald and settle simply for 'metaphysics'.\" Vertigo, then, is strange, baffling, and almost uncategorisable - but it is a must-read, or perhaps a must-try-to.",

Or maybe Penge?\" Damasio, like his colleagues, is probing science's last great mystery, unravelling the enigma of the human mind, the thing inside that interprets the firings of the neurons and conjures up an \"I\" to watch the movie in the brain.</p> <p>He is, however, at odds with many of his colleagues. Some of them think consciousness is an evolutionary adaptation conferring advantage in survival; some of them argue that the higher consciousness grew out of a capacity for language. He agrees with neither. He has a gut response, a visceral feeling that something else was at work first. He believes that human identity is a sensational response - a way of coping not just with feelings but with an awareness of those feelings. The human mind is a way of coping with fear, anger, disgust, laughter and other things as well: awe, social embarrassment, guilt and so on. These are all feelings, sensations, chemical events, changes in heart rate, skin responses. Knowledge of them is part of the bargain humans make with creation. Sea anemones and snails have feelings, but humans write novels about them. \"The cost of a better existence is the loss of innocence about that very existence,\" Damasio writes. \"The feeling of what happens is the answer to a question we never asked.\"</p> <p>That is why he called his new book The Feeling of What Happens. He wanted to get the idea of feeling in before the idea of consciousness. \"A lot of our constructions, such as morality and empathy and sympathy, really come from the fact that we feel, we know that we feel, and all of that comes from deep within, and is inseparable from being alive. Art is already an expression of a concern. I like the word concern.\"</p> <p>Damasio was born in Portugal in 1944, and grew up in the shadow of the dictator Salazar. From his earliest years, he was fascinated by how things worked, by engines made from Meccano. He went from there to the mechanisms of the mind, dithered about being a writer or philosopher, and then read about brain research and said: \"'This is exactly what I want to do!' I went into medical school and straight into the thing that interested me most.\"</p> <p>Well into his career as a neurologist - he has a chair at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, as well as a department in Iowa - he began to get interested in cases of frontal-lobe damage. The most famous was that of a railway worker called Phineas Gage, who in 1848 was in the wrong place when an explosive charge was ignited. The blast drove an iron spike right through his skull and out the other side. Before the accident Gage was well-liked and was considered honest, trustworthy and dependable. With a hole in his frontal neocortex, he became vulgar, irresponsible, capricious and prone to offensive profanity.</p> <p>The case was a classic piece of evidence that personality and identity were creations of the brain, and that the brain was a machine into which spanners could be thrown. Damasio, however, was more interested in the lesson to be drawn from the way patients with frontal-lobe damage will take decisions.</p> <p>\"What they have is an inability to decide correctly; they do it in a setting where the emotions are gone. If you suffer damage to your frontal lobe, especially in a particular territory, you will maintain your overt intelligence. You speak normally, you are very smart, you have lots of memory - and you make the most foolish decisions in relation to you, to your family, your work. In essence you go from being a productive member of society to a rather sociopathic kind of person.\"</p> <p>\"The big distinction is that you no longer have an ability to emote and feel normally, especially in relation to the social emotions. You don't feel embarrassment, you don't feel guilt - you don't feel pride for that matter - and so your ability to reason properly has been lost, together with your ability to feel properly. And that is what put me on to the idea that emotion is really the only explanation for this kind of problem. All my work starts from there.\"</p> <p> In short, humans feel, therefore they are. The mind could not exist without a body to inhabit - even if, paradoxically, everything to be known is known through the mind. Humans don't just experience risk, danger and pain, they know they experience risk, danger and pain. That is the first step on the journey to consciousness and, ultimately, to the higher consciousness that - helped by prodigious memory and fed by a fantastic capacity for language - leads to art and philosophy and the creation of conscience. Damasio thinks conscience is one of humankind's great creations.</p> <p>\"You cannot create conscience, you cannot create a sense of moral good and moral evil, if you do not have a sense of self. You need to have a sense of self first. Although I think religion of itself is another of our great creations, conscience, religion, morals, arts and science are different, very important human creations. But I think you can have a moral sense without practising a religion.\"</p> <p>People ask him, \"Aren't you afraid of solving the problem of consciousness? Aren't you afraid of taking away the mystery?\" Not at all. Consciousness is not the problem of mind, consciousness is the problem of knowing we own a mind.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>To give them their due, Lord Wakeham and his commission, who reported today on reform of the House of Lords, were wrestling with problems which have eluded every attempt to solve them in 90 years. Back in 1911, parliament agreed to an interim solution for the second chamber, to last only until a way was found of replacing hereditary peers. Every effort to find a new pattern thereafter foundered. Although there was broad support for ending the right of people (nearly all of them men) to speak and vote in Parliament merely through the accident of birth, no formula could be found for a new, democratic chamber, able to monitor and challenge governments without constituting a rival power base to the Commons.</p> <p>Lord Wakeham's team has failed too. It was given a year to deliberate, but even two years, or ten, would not have resolved its differences. The fact that a former chief whip was chairman guaranteed what kind of committee this was going to be. It was all about deals and fixes. It was not going to waste its effort on finding the \"best\" solution, in terms of ensuring good government or serving the interests of the voters, since however sublime a solution may be, it has little practical value if politicians are not going to buy it. So the Wakeham commission set out to devise a formula acceptable first to the prime minister and then to the parliament which would be called on time to push these changes through. That virtually excluded any recommendation for a second chamber elected by popular vote, as recommended by the Liberal Democrats and to some extent by the Conservative party. The government was not having that: too difficult to control. An elected second chamber would be able to call itself as democratically legitimate as the Commons, creating a check on untrammelled government power as formidable as the Commons - and probably very much more so than a Commons as docile as this one.</p> <p>And so they arrived at a botch. Some elected members should sit in the new second chamber, yes - though they could not agree how many - but only as a minority in an otherwise hand-picked assembly. Nor could the commission agree on a new name for the chamber, or on what its members should call themselves - senators, members of the Lords, or whatever. Despite their attempts to please it, the government's first response has been unenthusiastic, and it's hard to see anyone else being keener.

      "bodyText": "To give them their due, Lord Wakeham and his commission, who reported today on reform of the House of Lords, were wrestling with problems which have eluded every attempt to solve them in 90 years. Back in 1911, parliament agreed to an interim solution for the second chamber, to last only until a way was found of replacing hereditary peers. Every effort to find a new pattern thereafter foundered. Although there was broad support for ending the right of people (nearly all of them men) to speak and vote in Parliament merely through the accident of birth, no formula could be found for a new, democratic chamber, able to monitor and challenge governments without constituting a rival power base to the Commons. Lord Wakeham's team has failed too. It was given a year to deliberate, but even two years, or ten, would not have resolved its differences. The fact that a former chief whip was chairman guaranteed what kind of committee this was going to be. It was all about deals and fixes. It was not going to waste its effort on finding the \"best\" solution, in terms of ensuring good government or serving the interests of the voters, since however sublime a solution may be, it has little practical value if politicians are not going to buy it. So the Wakeham commission set out to devise a formula acceptable first to the prime minister and then to the parliament which would be called on time to push these changes through. That virtually excluded any recommendation for a second chamber elected by popular vote, as recommended by the Liberal Democrats and to some extent by the Conservative party. The government was not having that: too difficult to control. An elected second chamber would be able to call itself as democratically legitimate as the Commons, creating a check on untrammelled government power as formidable as the Commons - and probably very much more so than a Commons as docile as this one. And so they arrived at a botch. Some elected members should sit in the new second chamber, yes - though they could not agree how many - but only as a minority in an otherwise hand-picked assembly. Nor could the commission agree on a new name for the chamber, or on what its members should call themselves - senators, members of the Lords, or whatever. Despite their attempts to please it, the government's first response has been unenthusiastic, and it's hard to see anyone else being keener. It seems entirely possible that the \"interim\" solution, instituted last year after the despatch of most hereditary peers, could be with us for quite some time - which will mean that some ninety hereditaries, given a \"temporary\" reprieve at that time, will be sitting there for another decade or more. Which is what, one suspects, that wily Tory bird Lord Cranborne, member of one of the House's oldest families and architect of the plan which saved the 92 hereditary peers from extinction, was banking on all along.",

Next month, the nominations for the Oscars will be announced and three weeks later many of the same people who will be gratefully thanking their agents and their grandmothers for helping them to carry off a Globe statuette will be doing the same to a slightly larger audience as they receive their Oscars. </p> <p>Unless anyone actually dedicates their award to, say, \"Fidel, Saddam and Yasser for all their help and inspiration over the years\", the ceremonies themselves are likely to run smoothly. It has been a while since a winner took a deep breath and brought a political note to the proceedings. To do so is a bit like proposing a toast at a family gathering and talking about your father's incestuous tendencies (see Thomas Winterberg's Festen for the effect this causes). But this year's ceremonies will have an edge to them for a very different reason. </p> <p>They will cap a tempestuous year in Hollywood which has seen more than 20,000 jobs lost as productions take cheaper roads to Canada, Mexico and Australia, a host of high profile defections and, most recently, a bruising critique unleashed by two senior industry figures. </p> <p>The announcement of the Globe nominations came as Tinseltown was digesting the departure from the studio world of Joe Roth, the highly respected chairman of Walt Disney Studios, who announced that he was quitting to join the independent sector because he felt he would be happier free from the corporate constraints of a major publicly-held media company. </p> <p>His reservations about the studio system are echoed by two new books which question what has happened to the industry and how the structural changes affect the kind of films being produced. So what is going on? </p> <p>In Who Killed Hollywood and Put the Tarnish on Tinseltown? the editor-in-chief of Variety, the industry newspaper, Peter Bart, argues that \"the studios have lost their identities . . . they've been relegated to a new role as mere appendages of vast multinational corporations grinding out 'content' for their global distribution mills. Hollywood's assembly line has been scaled down and re-tooled not only to feed the world's movie theatres and television screens but also to channel new product and ideas into theme-park rides, music, toys, video game emporiums and all the other ancillary goodies that enhance the revenue streams of their corporate parents.\" </p> <p>Another book, Where Did I Go Right? You're No-one in Hollywood Unless Someone Wants You Dead - death seems to be a must in these book titles, this is Hollywood - features Bernie Brillstein, the veteran producer, manager and former studio chief, lamenting the arrival of a new breed of executive who once would have chosen to work on Wall Street but has come west to the film industry: \"My contemporaries were streetwise people. Sure, you could make money - and we wanted to - but nowhere near the kind of money you can make in the business today . . . Too many of today's showbusiness players just want to make the money their clients make. If power and notoriety are part of the bargain, all the better.\" </p> <p>The result of the change, suggests Peter Bart, who was once a studio executive at Paramount and MGM/United Artists, is not only that fewer films are being made but that productions are chosen for being as \"risk averse\" as possible; they are chosen because they will appeal to financing and marketing partners rather than an audience. </p> <p>\"Today the decision on whether to green-light a movie may involve scores of executives, with the debate hingeing on questions like: will the movie play well in Europe and Asia? Will the subject matter attract a marketing partner like a McDonald's? Will there be tie-ins for toys? Will the star be willing to travel to openings around the world?\" concludes Bart. </p> <p>This part of his argument can be backed up by figures released last week for the international box office receipts of American films. It is only since 1996 that the money taken from the international market has exceeded the revenues from the US market. </p> <p>Last year, 16 American films took more than $100m abroad. The message in the studios has to be: make the films that will make money abroad. This means make them to existing formulas, heavily promoted, expertly packaged and overwhelmingly predictable. </p> <p> It is a gratifying rebuke to this formulaic approach that many of the films in the running for awards this season address themselves to the dark as opposed to the redemptive side of the American psyche. The leading contenders for Globes - and, most likely, Oscars, whose shortlist is announced on February 15 - include films which expose corporate corruption (The Insider); satirise suburban emptiness (American Beauty); portray a young woman who tried to be a man (Boys Don't Cry); satirise suburban emptiness (The Election); portray a psychopath sympathetically (The Talented Mr Ripley) and expose the fatally - literally - flawed system of American justice (The Hurricane.) </p> <p>The merger between Time-Warner and America Online has merely fuelled the argument that multi-media ownership will lead to bland product and that every arm of a conglomerate will be required to operate on behalf of the studio's product. A conglomerate's magazines will get access to stars to plug that conglomerate's films which will be sympathetically handled on that conglomerate's television channel while tie-in marketing items are sold in that conglomerate's stores. Bart and Brillstein are hardly outsiders railing against the evils of capitalism and their disenchantment is an indication of the wider malaise and disillusionment in the business. </p> <p>Writer-director Ron Shelton (Bull Durham, White Men Can't Jump) has this week been promoting his new film, Play It to the Bone starring Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas. He has used the occasion to attack the studios for their narrow views and obsession with marketing and demographics at the expense of film-making. </p> <p>Not everyone, of course, buys the pessimistic take on what has been happening in the film industry over the past decade. Lynda Obst, a producer at Paramount, is the author of Hello, He Lied and Other Truths from the Hollywood Trenches. (Can't anyone write a two-word book title any more?) Obst is less impressed about the great old days. In a tongue in cheek review of Brillstein's book in the Los Angeles Times last week, Obst thanks him for clarifying a number of things about studio executives: that they are mostly in the business for the sex. \"Showbusiness has always been a great trade-off, a way to get laid because most men in that line of work are, let's face it, not that attractive,\" says Brillstein. </p> <p>Obst notes: \"He said it . . . Chicks in flicks hate the game part. We wish we could just make the movie and go home to dinner.\" </p> <p>Another woman producer who has written about her experience of the movie business is Christine Vachon who was responsible for Safe, I Shot Andy Warhol and Velvet Godmine and has described the process in her book, Shooting to Kill (death, again.) In her list of dos and don'ts for would-be independent film-makers she includes the advice: \"Never compare your film to Mean Streets . . . I hope that the film-makers I work with are not simply trying to rehash elements from financially successful films. Do that song and dance when you pitch to Paramount.\" </p> <p>And so to the Globes, the awards made by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA ) which currently consists of 84 foreign journalists who cover Hollywood for their own countries. The awards started in 1944 and the event was low-key and pretty much unremarked outside Los Angeles. When it was first screened on television in 1995 it attracted an audience of 7m. Now the event is networked and last year attracted 50m, a figure which will certainly be exceeded this year. </p> <p>What is interesting is the way in which the film industry has helped to give the event a credibility it might never have had, for the HPFA has had a lingering reputation for containing more that its fair share of star-struck oddballs who knew little about film - some were not even journalists - but a lot about receiving hospitality. One American Hollywood critic described them as the only people he knew who lived entirely off hors d'oeuvres. However, the current executive is anxious to say that those days have gone, and to clean up the organisation's image. </p> <p>Certainly their choices, as evidenced in the shortlists, correspond largely with those of their more thoughtful US counterparts. It is the independent films - whether genuinely independent or made by one of the big studios' \"independent\" arms - that are being lauded. </p> <p>The Golden Globes ceremony has been wholly embraced by the studios which have a chance before the Oscars for their films to be brought to the attention of 50m-plus television viewers, a wonderfully cost- effective marketing opportunity. Variety has devoted a special issue to the event, even listing details of the best ways to enter post-award parties at the Beverly Hills Hilton. (To get to the rooftop bash, take the elevator to the fourth floor and walk down the long corridor to the exit that opens on to the garage roof.) </p> <p>One of the regular features at the Oscars which always produces a discreet flutter of handkerchiefs in the audience is the review of all the actors who have died in the previous year, with clips from their old films shown. One of those who will feature at this year's ceremony will be George C Scott, who died last year aged 71. He was nominated four times for an Oscar and won in 1970 for his portrayal of General Patton in the eponymous film, but didn't accept the statuette. He described the ceremony thus: \"A meaningless, self-serving meat parade. It is barbarous and innately corrupt.\" </p> <p>The studios will be watching the results of both the Globes and the Oscars closely because they see them as far from barbarous and certainly not meaningless. The Globes now quite closely foreshadow the Oscars and many critics and film industry people feel that nothing would be better for the business than a healthy round of victories to go to films that do not seem to have been made according to formulas and with marketing tie-ins in mind. </p> <p>For all the departure of business across the nearest foreign borders, Hollywood is still healthy and highly profitable and is not suddenly going to abandon making films that will generate a predictable profit. </p> <p>However, if the dark and the quirky and the unpredictable in film-making can be shown to succeed at the highest level, winning prizes and making bucks as they do, there will be a hope that America's burgeoning independent sector can make more of the kind of fresh, original, dangerous films that people would, well, kill to see.</p>",

Next month, the nominations for the Oscars will be announced and three weeks later many of the same people who will be gratefully thanking their agents and their grandmothers for helping them to carry off a Globe statuette will be doing the same to a slightly larger audience as they receive their Oscars. Unless anyone actually dedicates their award to, say, \"Fidel, Saddam and Yasser for all their help and inspiration over the years\", the ceremonies themselves are likely to run smoothly. It has been a while since a winner took a deep breath and brought a political note to the proceedings. To do so is a bit like proposing a toast at a family gathering and talking about your father's incestuous tendencies (see Thomas Winterberg's Festen for the effect this causes).

      "body": "<p>What's in a name? On the world wide web, perhaps millions of pounds. As e-commerce burst into the public consciousness last year, the scramble to establish a web presence began to reach gold rush proportions. And like shovel sellers who made a fortune from the prospectors, vendors of domain names have flourished now that the latest must-have accessory is a snappy web address. </p> <p>Domain names are the unique part of the web address of a site, and as internet hype has snowballed, so has the rush to stake a claim in cyberspace. In the middle, in charge of this important part of the net's plumbing, is one US-based company: <a href=\"http://www.networksolutions.com\">Network Solutions</a>. </p> <p>This fact has upset many people online. Six years ago, when your life was complete without the words \"e-commerce\" and \"MP3\", the US government handed to NSI some obscure rights to domain name suffixes, including those to the all important \".com\" ending. The problems for NSI came when its obscure rights got the company placed right in the middle of one of the greatest revolutions of the 20th century. </p> <p>When other companies saw NSI sitting unchallenged on top the domains goldmine, they began to cry foul. The disagreements were resolved only recently, when the US Department of Commerce chaired an agreement between NSI and a non profit organisation called the <a href=\"http://www.icann.org/\" target=\"_new\">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann)</a>. </p> <p>Headed by Esther Dyson, \"queen of the internet\" and Online columnist, Icann won the right for approved companies to access the Whois database, where all .com, .org and .net info is listed. \"We've all kissed and made up,\" she explained. \"It is now clear... that the Whois database is available to anybody.\" </p> <p>Agreement or not, NSI still hit the headlines several times recently. </p> <p>First it had to withdraw almost a thousand domains it issued by mistake. Then a hacker tapped into NSI's database and began redirecting addresses to a single site. Netizens everywhere remain disgruntled. </p> <p>To get yourself that snappy website name requires either skill or cash. The skill comes not in thinking up a neat name, but finding one that's available. Take a random choice such as, say, the unlikely \"monkeyjuice\", and you will quickly find that the name Monkeyjuice.com is taken, as are so many of the precious .com domains. Head to the handy search tool at NSI's site and you'll find all the three letter domains are long gone, even com.com's been snapped up. </p> <p>But once you locate an available domain, follow the instructions (the \"wizard\" after the domain search), add your details then your credit card info and proceed to make your mark in cyberspace. One small step for man, one tiny but important drop in the virtual ocean for you. </p> <p>The British domains are controlled by <a href=\"http://www.nominet.org.uk\">Nominet</a>, a non-profit organisation given powers by NSI. Having recently lowered the cost of registering the co.uk domain, Nominet has seen an explosion of companies offering free, or practically free domains. </p> <p>Additional interactive features like email may cost more. To register a co.uk name yourself, you have to contact one of the many internet service providers (ISPs) listed at Nominet. The database, however, suffered a serious crash on January 12. The website adds: \"The full domain name index has been restored, but recovery of full registrant details continues.\" </p> <p>To register a co.uk domain go to, for example, <a href=\"http://www.usp.net\">www.usp.net</a> and insert your domain of choice into the \"check availability\" box. Follow the instructions, filling in your details and then credit card numbers. </p> <p>If you don't have that skill or very good timing, then obtaining the perfect domain name will now cost you dearly. As the interest in the web has boomed, so has a lucrative cottage industry: playing the domain name game. For any company wanting to make an online impression, a memorable domain name is essential. And www.please/remember/this.sorrywhatdidyousay?simply won't cut it. </p> <p>Many websites are discovered by word of mouth, and in this world \".com\" is king.

      "bodyText": "What's in a name? On the world wide web, perhaps millions of pounds. As e-commerce burst into the public consciousness last year, the scramble to establish a web presence began to reach gold rush proportions. And like shovel sellers who made a fortune from the prospectors, vendors of domain names have flourished now that the latest must-have accessory is a snappy web address. Domain names are the unique part of the web address of a site, and as internet hype has snowballed, so has the rush to stake a claim in cyberspace. In the middle, in charge of this important part of the net's plumbing, is one US-based company: Network Solutions. This fact has upset many people online. Six years ago, when your life was complete without the words \"e-commerce\" and \"MP3\", the US government handed to NSI some obscure rights to domain name suffixes, including those to the all important \".com\" ending. The problems for NSI came when its obscure rights got the company placed right in the middle of one of the greatest revolutions of the 20th century. When other companies saw NSI sitting unchallenged on top the domains goldmine, they began to cry foul. The disagreements were resolved only recently, when the US Department of Commerce chaired an agreement between NSI and a non profit organisation called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann). Headed by Esther Dyson, \"queen of the internet\" and Online columnist, Icann won the right for approved companies to access the Whois database, where all .com, .org and .net info is listed. \"We've all kissed and made up,\" she explained. \"It is now clear... that the Whois database is available to anybody.\" Agreement or not, NSI still hit the headlines several times recently. First it had to withdraw almost a thousand domains it issued by mistake. Then a hacker tapped into NSI's database and began redirecting addresses to a single site. Netizens everywhere remain disgruntled. To get yourself that snappy website name requires either skill or cash. The skill comes not in thinking up a neat name, but finding one that's available. Take a random choice such as, say, the unlikely \"monkeyjuice\", and you will quickly find that the name Monkeyjuice.com is taken, as are so many of the precious .com domains. Head to the handy search tool at NSI's site and you'll find all the three letter domains are long gone, even com.com's been snapped up. But once you locate an available domain, follow the instructions (the \"wizard\" after the domain search), add your details then your credit card info and proceed to make your mark in cyberspace. One small step for man, one tiny but important drop in the virtual ocean for you. The British domains are controlled by Nominet, a non-profit organisation given powers by NSI. Having recently lowered the cost of registering the co.uk domain, Nominet has seen an explosion of companies offering free, or practically free domains. Additional interactive features like email may cost more. To register a co.uk name yourself, you have to contact one of the many internet service providers (ISPs) listed at Nominet. The database, however, suffered a serious crash on January 12. The website adds: \"The full domain name index has been restored, but recovery of full registrant details continues.\" To register a co.uk domain go to, for example, www.usp.net and insert your domain of choice into the \"check availability\" box. Follow the instructions, filling in your details and then credit card numbers. If you don't have that skill or very good timing, then obtaining the perfect domain name will now cost you dearly. As the interest in the web has boomed, so has a lucrative cottage industry: playing the domain name game. For any company wanting to make an online impression, a memorable domain name is essential. And www.please/remember/this.sorrywhatdidyousay?simply won't cut it. Many websites are discovered by word of mouth, and in this world \".com\" is king. There are hundreds of domain names other than the .org, .com and .net suffixes. These include the well known .co.uk, but vary to suit the colourful spectrum of nations whoch is now online [see http://uninett.no/navn/domreg.htm], such as .is or .fm.

      "body": "<p>A gleeful little press release winged its way to most media organisations this week. A survey had shown that <a href=\"http://www.handbag.com\" target=\"_new\">handbag.com</a> - the website launched four months ago with much hullabaloo and the slogan: \"A woman is lost without her handbag.com\" - was the most widely recognised and visited women's website among UK female internet users. Of the 404 women surveyed, 30% said they were aware of the site, launched by Boots and Hollinger Telegraph New Media, compared with 10% awareness for its chief competitor, the Daily Mail's <a href=\"http://www.CharlotteStreet.com\" target=\"_new\">CharlotteStreet.com</a>, and 58% for the well-established <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">amazon.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>Awareness is one thing, enthusiasm quite another. What the survey tells us is that the 300,000 users who have visited the site are staying online for about 10 minutes, with health, beauty, shopping and fashion the most popular channels. What it doesn't tell us is what those women thought of the service they were offered.</p> <p>So let's take a look ourselves. The main offerings yesterday were Wok Around The Clock, about buying and using a wok; an item on millennium celebrations in the Antipodes; an opportunity to discuss sex problems with sex expert Tricia Kreitman; and a health and beauty quiz, with questions like: \"What is the average weight of a UK female?\"</p> <p>CharlotteStreet.com, meanwhile, was concentrating on getting fit after flu, millennium marriages, grandmothers getting IVF and parental leave rights. Oh, and there's shopping. There's always shopping.</p> <p>The internet may have set the world on fire, but these sites, sadly, barely ignite a spark. A quick survey of women working in the net industry confirmed my own impressions: \"banal\", \"patronising\", \"disappointing\" were common reactions.</p> <p>\"Everybody's in a bit of a rush to capture market share,\" says Carol Dukes, founder of thinknatural.com, a website promoting natural health. \"They are going for what they think is a big target market, ie women, but which may prove not to exist. They are trying to be all things to all women. I don't think you can meaningfully target 'women'. Targeting women just as women is about as meaningful as targeting men just as men.</p> <p>\"What the internet does superbly is offer special interest information. Because it's a go-seek medium, you have to have a good reason to go somewhere. The more generalist the site, the harder it is for people to know why they are going there. With TV, people let it wash over them. The internet is different. It serves niche markets.\"</p> <p>Dukes' own site has avoided being gender-specific, but the overall user base is skewed towards women because it is largely women who look after health in the family. \"Everyone's running to do things very, very fast, but the subtlety and the craft of developing a brand personality will take time. It's a skill acquired by print journalism over years. It's still early days on the internet.\"</p> <p>So why the sudden hurry? Recent research has shown a massive growth in women using the net. Five years ago, women made up just 10% of the UK internet community; that figure is now 40% and looks set to keep rising. More women under 24 than men are already on the net. Add to that the fact that women make two-thirds of all purchasing decisions in a household and watch the gold rush.</p> <p>This is one of the key differences in the way women are targeted. They are seen first and foremost as shoppers; everything is dictated by the commercial imperative. Wow, you're surfing the world wide web, you're in cyberspace ... Want to buy some chocolate, a Liberty scarf, some lactating breast pads?</p> <p>Maybe it will all be different when magazine group IPC, which includes titles such as Marie Claire and Woman's Own, launches Beme.com early next month. Its media director, Hilary Burden, promises it will be the \"best site for women in the world\".</p> <p>As Burden is well aware, there is considerable competition from the States where there are already sites for women that are challenging and interesting in a way the UK portals for women are not. There's I-Village.com, where earlier this week you could chat with Hillary Clinton; salon.com, with its Mothers Who Think channel full of high-quality women's writing; and chickclick.com with 30-plus home-grown sites called everything from Disgruntled Housewife to Riotgrrl and Hipmama. Of course the commercial element exists, but the women targeted by these sites are treated as intelligent net users rather than unadulterated shopaholics.</p> <p>Burden admires such sites but says they can't reflect British women's experience. \"We are completely different: CharlotteStreet.com comes out of the Daily Mail and is primarily repeating Mail stories, handbag.com is from the Telegraph, but we come out of an organisation that really knows the female audience. We are not saying Beme is a women's channel - it's for women and by women, but it includes men, too. Of course there's a commercial reality: we don't have a cover price so you need to be able to sell advertising. But we are very, very keen to make it something people can trust. It is an editorial-led site rather than a shopping-led site.\"</p> <p>Ultimately the net is out there for all of us, irrespective of our gender. As more and more women get on-line, as more women get involved in the creation and management of sites (and make their e-fortunes alongside their male counterparts), so the nature of the beast is constantly changing. We're all going to need the internet, whether it's to get the latest global news as it breaks or to email friends across the room. What women don't need is just another excuse to target our credit cards.</p>",

Awareness is one thing, enthusiasm quite another. What the survey tells us is that the 300,000 users who have visited the site are staying online for about 10 minutes, with health, beauty, shopping and fashion the most popular channels. What it doesn't tell us is what those women thought of the service they were offered. So let's take a look ourselves. The main offerings yesterday were Wok Around The Clock, about buying and using a wok; an item on millennium celebrations in the Antipodes; an opportunity to discuss sex problems with sex expert Tricia Kreitman; and a health and beauty quiz, with questions like: \"What is the average weight of a UK female?\" CharlotteStreet.com, meanwhile, was concentrating on getting fit after flu, millennium marriages, grandmothers getting IVF and parental leave rights. Oh, and there's shopping. There's always shopping. The internet may have set the world on fire, but these sites, sadly, barely ignite a spark. A quick survey of women working in the net industry confirmed my own impressions: \"banal\", \"patronising\", \"disappointing\" were common reactions. \"Everybody's in a bit of a rush to capture market share,\" says Carol Dukes, founder of thinknatural.com, a website promoting natural health. \"They are going for what they think is a big target market, ie women, but which may prove not to exist. They are trying to be all things to all women. I don't think you can meaningfully target 'women'. Targeting women just as women is about as meaningful as targeting men just as men. \"What the internet does superbly is offer special interest information. Because it's a go-seek medium, you have to have a good reason to go somewhere. The more generalist the site, the harder it is for people to know why they are going there. With TV, people let it wash over them. The internet is different. It serves niche markets.\" Dukes' own site has avoided being gender-specific, but the overall user base is skewed towards women because it is largely women who look after health in the family. \"Everyone's running to do things very, very fast, but the subtlety and the craft of developing a brand personality will take time. It's a skill acquired by print journalism over years. It's still early days on the internet.\" So why the sudden hurry? Recent research has shown a massive growth in women using the net. Five years ago, women made up just 10% of the UK internet community; that figure is now 40% and looks set to keep rising. More women under 24 than men are already on the net. Add to that the fact that women make two-thirds of all purchasing decisions in a household and watch the gold rush. This is one of the key differences in the way women are targeted. They are seen first and foremost as shoppers; everything is dictated by the commercial imperative. Wow, you're surfing the world wide web, you're in cyberspace ... Want to buy some chocolate, a Liberty scarf, some lactating breast pads? Maybe it will all be different when magazine group IPC, which includes titles such as Marie Claire and Woman's Own, launches Beme.com early next month. Its media director, Hilary Burden, promises it will be the \"best site for women in the world\". As Burden is well aware, there is considerable competition from the States where there are already sites for women that are challenging and interesting in a way the UK portals for women are not. There's I-Village.com, where earlier this week you could chat with Hillary Clinton; salon.com, with its Mothers Who Think channel full of high-quality women's writing; and chickclick.com with 30-plus home-grown sites called everything from Disgruntled Housewife to Riotgrrl and Hipmama. Of course the commercial element exists, but the women targeted by these sites are treated as intelligent net users rather than unadulterated shopaholics. Burden admires such sites but says they can't reflect British women's experience. \"We are completely different: CharlotteStreet.com comes out of the Daily Mail and is primarily repeating Mail stories, handbag.com is from the Telegraph, but we come out of an organisation that really knows the female audience. We are not saying Beme is a women's channel - it's for women and by women, but it includes men, too. Of course there's a commercial reality: we don't have a cover price so you need to be able to sell advertising. But we are very, very keen to make it something people can trust. It is an editorial-led site rather than a shopping-led site.\" Ultimately the net is out there for all of us, irrespective of our gender. As more and more women get on-line, as more women get involved in the creation and management of sites (and make their e-fortunes alongside their male counterparts), so the nature of the beast is constantly changing. We're all going to need the internet, whether it's to get the latest global news as it breaks or to email friends across the room. What women don't need is just another excuse to target our credit cards.",

      "body": "<p>The SS did not class Mauthausen as a death camp, but of 191,938 prisoners who passed through its gates at least 86,185 would die there. People died through medical experiments in which they were injected with typhus and tested with quack cures. Others were starved as the Nazis tested how much malnourishment the human body could endure.</p> <p>Those who did not perish in Mauthausen's gas chambers died working in the nearby stone quarries where prisoners were used as slave labour. Some were crushed as they were made to carry boulders. Five thousand people who could not work or who were mentally handicapped were exterminated under a programme which bore the anodyne file name of 14F 13.</p> <p>Alexander Schweidler says the scale of this human misery passed him by in his three years as a guard, as did the shootings, the hangings and the beatings. Of those who died one third are estimated to have been Jews. Mauthausen also held Poles, Russians, French, Spanish Republicans and Soviet prisoners of war.</p> <p>Mr Schweidler denies any direct knowledge of the mass murder or ill treatment that caused so many to perish.</p> <p>In the bungalow into which he and his wife moved in November last year, Alexander Schweidler looks like the archetypal grandfather in his red woollen hat, cardigan and purple slippers. He is still angry at the United States's decision to throw him out. His wife Anna says: \"Have we done something wrong again?\"</p> <p>In the corner of his front room is an electric organ, on which Mr Schweidler plays German favourites such as the 'beer barrel polka'.</p> <p>The most damning evidence against him concerning alleged war crimes is the document bearing his signature in which he details shooting dead two Russians who were trying to escape.</p> <p>He told US investigators that senior officers had told him to sign the document. But he gave the Guardian a different account, saying the document was \"falsified\". He did not know by whom.</p> <p>He said: \"I never shot anyone, not to my knowledge.\"</p> <p>Later he said: \"I believe the Geneva convention says that if an armed soldier stands guard at a prison camp where soldiers are, and there are some soldiers trying to escape, and the armed guard shoots some of them, that isn't even a war crime... I'm saying still I never did it. They're holding that against me when it might not actually be a war crime.\"</p> <p>He said he did hear talk that there were gas chambers, but never set foot inside the camp, merely patrolled the perimeter.</p> <p>Mr Schweidler maintains he saw no killings. \"In those days I was courting my first wife, I didn't care about anything much except when I could get out and meet her.</p> <p>\"I just forget, one of my bad things is I'm forgetting very easily, I always have.\"</p> <p>Mr Schweidler says that even if he had known, there was nothing he could have done. To have intervened could have cost him his life.</p> <p>He was born in Pressburg, Slovakia, on January 18 1922. He was part of the ethnic German minority, and admits in his youth being a fan of Adolf Hitler: \"What do you know as a 16-year-old boy, everything was nice and rosy.\"</p> <p>Mr Schweidler says he was proud when he was chosen to serve in the SS. He fought in campaigns against Holland and France, and was awarded the Iron Cross.</p> <p>In February 1941 he became a German citizen and was wounded in September of that year. Aged 20 he was posted to Mauthausen, serving from January 1942 until the camp's liberation in May 1945 by American troops.</p> <p>If Mr Schweidler was just a guard he was a lucky one, because by the war's end he had been promoted to sergeant. If his account is correct, all he did was stand on the outer edge of the camp. He said he fled the camp days before the Americans arrived because he feared capture.</p> <p>He moved to Britain in 1948 and became a naturalised citizen in 1964. The next year he went to the US where he worked his way up from a cleaner to become a computer programmer.</p> <p>His retirement to a house with a pool in Florida came to a crashing halt when a routine immigration check flagged him as a suspected war criminal. He chose to return to Britain in 1994 after deportation proceedings began and he is barred from re-entering the US.</p> <p>Looking back at his time at Mauthausen is clearly difficult for Mr Schweidler, but he can remember enough to have regrets: \"It shouldn't have happened. I wish I hadn't been there myself. That's fate.\"</p> <p>It was also John Sowa's fate to end up in Mauthausen. Now settled in Britain, his memories of Mauthausen are clearer than Mr Schweidler's. He survived two years in its notorious stone quarry where prisoners were forced to work with their bare hands. For many the only escape was death.</p> <p>Mr Sowa, 74, who lives in London, is still on plagued by nightmares: \"Anybody who is in a camp, it is with them for life.\"</p> <p>When he left after liberation, he was just skin and bones and spent six months in hospital recovering.</p> <p>Fed on starvation rations, Mr Sowa was forced to pick up rocks in the quarry and carry them to a crushing machine. He had no shoes, just wooden clogs, no socks and no tools.</p> <p>\"A hell of a lot of people died. Everytime we returned to the camp, there were four or five dead. Mauthausen was an extermination camp, just as Auschwitz was. In Auschwitz they sent people to the gas chambers, in Mauthausen they sent you to do work which you simply could not manage.</p> <p>\"I carried the heaviest load, a hundredweight. I don't know how I did it, and loaded it with my bare hands. The sharp ends of the stone cut my hands and they were bleeding.\"</p> <p>Mr Sowa was sent to Mauthausen from Warsaw, and can still recall its sadism. One prisoner who tried and failed to escape had a boulder put on his shoulder. Dogs were then let loose as he tried to run for his life. The dogs killed him.</p> <p>Mr Sowa is in no doubt that all the guards at Mauthausen and its satellite camps were war criminals: \"I will call them murderers, plain murderers. They murdered children, women and men. It gave them pleasure.\"</p> <p>A leading authority on the Holocaust is also in no doubt about the culpability of the guards. Peter Black, senior historian at the US Holocaust museum, said: \"The guards were taught quite explicitly that the prisoners were diehard enemies and that it was quite proper if they encountered resistance to shoot first and ask questions later. The camp system could not have been run in the way it was, with the brutality it was, without the camp guards' assistance.\"</p> <p>The view that all at Mauthausen were criminally responsible for the atrocities was stated by a US military tribunal in 1946: \"The circumstances, conditions and the very nature of the concentration camp Mauthausen was of such a criminal nature as to cause every official - governmental, military and civil - and every employee thereof, whether he be a member of the Waffen SS, Allgemeine SS, a guard or civilian, to be culpably and criminally responsible.\"</p> <p>Whether the past will catch up with Mr Schweidler will be up to the British authorities.

      "bodyText": "The SS did not class Mauthausen as a death camp, but of 191,938 prisoners who passed through its gates at least 86,185 would die there. People died through medical experiments in which they were injected with typhus and tested with quack cures. Others were starved as the Nazis tested how much malnourishment the human body could endure. Those who did not perish in Mauthausen's gas chambers died working in the nearby stone quarries where prisoners were used as slave labour. Some were crushed as they were made to carry boulders. Five thousand people who could not work or who were mentally handicapped were exterminated under a programme which bore the anodyne file name of 14F 13. Alexander Schweidler says the scale of this human misery passed him by in his three years as a guard, as did the shootings, the hangings and the beatings. Of those who died one third are estimated to have been Jews. Mauthausen also held Poles, Russians, French, Spanish Republicans and Soviet prisoners of war. Mr Schweidler denies any direct knowledge of the mass murder or ill treatment that caused so many to perish. In the bungalow into which he and his wife moved in November last year, Alexander Schweidler looks like the archetypal grandfather in his red woollen hat, cardigan and purple slippers. He is still angry at the United States's decision to throw him out. His wife Anna says: \"Have we done something wrong again?\" In the corner of his front room is an electric organ, on which Mr Schweidler plays German favourites such as the 'beer barrel polka'. The most damning evidence against him concerning alleged war crimes is the document bearing his signature in which he details shooting dead two Russians who were trying to escape. He told US investigators that senior officers had told him to sign the document. But he gave the Guardian a different account, saying the document was \"falsified\". He did not know by whom. He said: \"I never shot anyone, not to my knowledge.\" Later he said: \"I believe the Geneva convention says that if an armed soldier stands guard at a prison camp where soldiers are, and there are some soldiers trying to escape, and the armed guard shoots some of them, that isn't even a war crime... I'm saying still I never did it. They're holding that against me when it might not actually be a war crime.\" He said he did hear talk that there were gas chambers, but never set foot inside the camp, merely patrolled the perimeter. Mr Schweidler maintains he saw no killings. \"In those days I was courting my first wife, I didn't care about anything much except when I could get out and meet her. \"I just forget, one of my bad things is I'm forgetting very easily, I always have.\" Mr Schweidler says that even if he had known, there was nothing he could have done. To have intervened could have cost him his life. He was born in Pressburg, Slovakia, on January 18 1922. He was part of the ethnic German minority, and admits in his youth being a fan of Adolf Hitler: \"What do you know as a 16-year-old boy, everything was nice and rosy.\" Mr Schweidler says he was proud when he was chosen to serve in the SS. He fought in campaigns against Holland and France, and was awarded the Iron Cross. In February 1941 he became a German citizen and was wounded in September of that year. Aged 20 he was posted to Mauthausen, serving from January 1942 until the camp's liberation in May 1945 by American troops. If Mr Schweidler was just a guard he was a lucky one, because by the war's end he had been promoted to sergeant. If his account is correct, all he did was stand on the outer edge of the camp. He said he fled the camp days before the Americans arrived because he feared capture. He moved to Britain in 1948 and became a naturalised citizen in 1964. The next year he went to the US where he worked his way up from a cleaner to become a computer programmer. His retirement to a house with a pool in Florida came to a crashing halt when a routine immigration check flagged him as a suspected war criminal. He chose to return to Britain in 1994 after deportation proceedings began and he is barred from re-entering the US. Looking back at his time at Mauthausen is clearly difficult for Mr Schweidler, but he can remember enough to have regrets: \"It shouldn't have happened. I wish I hadn't been there myself. That's fate.\" It was also John Sowa's fate to end up in Mauthausen. Now settled in Britain, his memories of Mauthausen are clearer than Mr Schweidler's. He survived two years in its notorious stone quarry where prisoners were forced to work with their bare hands. For many the only escape was death. Mr Sowa, 74, who lives in London, is still on plagued by nightmares: \"Anybody who is in a camp, it is with them for life.\" When he left after liberation, he was just skin and bones and spent six months in hospital recovering. Fed on starvation rations, Mr Sowa was forced to pick up rocks in the quarry and carry them to a crushing machine. He had no shoes, just wooden clogs, no socks and no tools. \"A hell of a lot of people died. Everytime we returned to the camp, there were four or five dead. Mauthausen was an extermination camp, just as Auschwitz was. In Auschwitz they sent people to the gas chambers, in Mauthausen they sent you to do work which you simply could not manage. \"I carried the heaviest load, a hundredweight. I don't know how I did it, and loaded it with my bare hands. The sharp ends of the stone cut my hands and they were bleeding.\" Mr Sowa was sent to Mauthausen from Warsaw, and can still recall its sadism. One prisoner who tried and failed to escape had a boulder put on his shoulder. Dogs were then let loose as he tried to run for his life. The dogs killed him. Mr Sowa is in no doubt that all the guards at Mauthausen and its satellite camps were war criminals: \"I will call them murderers, plain murderers. They murdered children, women and men. It gave them pleasure.\" A leading authority on the Holocaust is also in no doubt about the culpability of the guards. Peter Black, senior historian at the US Holocaust museum, said: \"The guards were taught quite explicitly that the prisoners were diehard enemies and that it was quite proper if they encountered resistance to shoot first and ask questions later. The camp system could not have been run in the way it was, with the brutality it was, without the camp guards' assistance.\" The view that all at Mauthausen were criminally responsible for the atrocities was stated by a US military tribunal in 1946: \"The circumstances, conditions and the very nature of the concentration camp Mauthausen was of such a criminal nature as to cause every official - governmental, military and civil - and every employee thereof, whether he be a member of the Waffen SS, Allgemeine SS, a guard or civilian, to be culpably and criminally responsible.\" Whether the past will catch up with Mr Schweidler will be up to the British authorities. He is keen to show two letters from Scotland Yard saying that there would be no prosecution of him following an investigation. For Jewish groups, there is no doubt that Mr Schweidler should be reinvestigated. Mr Schweidler's former neighbours believe that he should be left alone. For five years he lived in Milton Keynes two miles away from his current address. Both his neighbours said he and his wife were a lovely couple, and said that talk of Mr Schweidler being a war criminal was a witchhunt. 8 January: War crimes suspect goes to ground Simon Wiesenthal Center The holocaust history project The Home Office: Immigration information",

      "body": "<p>In the pantheon of unkind book reviews, there have been worse slanders. Jessica Duchen's biography of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, the Austrian composer, stood accused of a \"lack of empathy\", a \"failure to enthuse\" and an over-simplicity that reduced it to a work of \"great disapointment [sic]\". The forum was Amazon.co.uk, the online bookshop; the reviewer, an anonymous contributor to the customer comments section signing himself \"a reader from London\". </p> <p>It wasn't the criticism that annoyed Duchen, but the suspicion of foul play behind it. Perhaps the bad spelling tipped her off, or the tautologous prose style (\"further investigate the artist's work further\"), but when Duchen read the review she had an uneasy feeling about its authorship. It was not, she suspected, the response of a disinterested member of the public, but the work of an adversary out to get her. Amazon's bluff entreaty to \"Share your thoughts with other readers!\" had been exploited, she believed, as a licence to \"Trash your rivals and get away with it!\" </p> <p>If this is the case, it represents a stunning inversion of publishers' hopes for Amazon. Authors' much savoured grumble - that, like theatre reviewers, book critics allow professional jealousy to colour their reviews since they are all failed novelists - holds no sway at Amazon, where members of the public provide the bulk of review copy. Those dear, guileless readers have, over the past year, posted 1,921 reviews of Thomas Harris's Hannibal, 370 of Michael Crichton's Timeline, 91 of Alex Garland's The Beach and enjoyed snippy exchanges about the value of the opinions. The concept of a \"reading community\", once defunct almost to the point of oxymoron, suddenly leapt to life and threatened to wrest critical opinion away from the professionals and hand it to the readers. </p> <p>As with most internet forums, Amazon's comment section attracted a fair share of cranks and morons, its \"horrible book - I could have written better\" rants that sensible authors ignored. But the site's combination of anonymity and vast exposure also enabled what Duchen believes to be a more damaging line of spite. </p> <p>Philip Pullman agrees. Pullman's forthcoming book, The Amber Spyglass, has been promoted on Amazon for the past couple of months. In December, the Oxford author received an unexpected call from his US publicists, who had logged on to the book's promotional page and noted with alarm that the section dedicated to author's comments had been filled in by an impostor. \"It was completely illiterate stuff,\" says Pullman. \"Any old twit can log on and review a book, or click on the 'I am the Author' button and post up a load of old rubbish. They hadn't even spelled my name right.\" Amazon swiftly removed the posting, but not before Pullman had converted his initial amusement into anger. \"God knows how many people saw it,\" he says with a shudder. </p> <p>\"The review was posted last February,\" says Duchen of her own misfortune. \"I didn't check it until September and thought, 'My God, what is this?'\" The Korngold biography was Duchen's first book. It was reviewed in the major music magazines and received largely favourable notices, although she insists she wasn't over-sensitive about the bad ones. \"I thought the criticisms were fair and well-expressed. But this was different. It referred to talks I had done on Korngold, outlining my intentions to stir up enthusiasm for the music. The reviewer said this was exactly what I hadn't done. There was a sense that here was a person being nasty for the sake of it.\" </p> <p>Duchen is a critic herself and suspects the phantom reviewer is someone she has crossed in a former article. It is not altogether paranoid. \"Duchen had a point,\" says Kate Pool, editor of the Author magazine. Duchen referred her concerns to the magazine's parent organisation, the Society of Authors, which sustained a \"very lively\" debate about it, but concluded nothing could be done. \"We have always been aware of the potential for trouble,\" says Pool. \"But the whole essence of the internet is freedom of expression, and how could you regulate it anyway?\" </p> <p>Publicly, publishers sympathise with their authors' vulnerability to Amazon's maverick reviewers. Privately, however, there is a sense that they have more to lose in reforming the system. \"We have regular discussions about this area of online reviewing,\" says Joanna Prior, head of publicity at Penguin Books. \"It is open to people using it in a malicious way. I don't know how you would prevent it.\" </p> <p>Don't hold your breath for suggestions. Publishers aren't as innocent in all this as might be expected and, while it is unlikely that they'd stoop to trashing rival books on Amazon, there is little doubt that they use it as an extension of their sales pitch. \"As a publisher, one is tempted to add in favourable reviews about our books,\" admits Katie James, head of Macmillan publicity. \"We have done it once or twice, pretending to be members of the public.\" She giggles. \"I mean, we are members of the public, but we have a professional vested interest.\" </p> <p>The admissions are just as frank at Penguin. \"The more editorial information there is on a book, the more likely people are to buy it,\" says Prior. \"I encourage staff, not necessarily associated with the book, to review it on Amazon. It is a free advert.\" </p> <p>Evidence for this is manifest in the reviews one finds that are dated before the official publication of the book, a discreet indication that they emanate from within the author's publishing house. </p> <p>\"Allowing anonymity opens the service to too much misuse,\" says Duchen. \"If you are honest, you don't need the protection of anonymity. It is an invitation for people to start inventing things.\" But as far as Amazon customers are concerned, the possibility of invention is half the fun of browsing the reviews. Like most features on the internet, you are never quite sure of what is real and what is hoax. The customer comments are valuable, not as measured criticisms, but as gut reactions, spicy dialogues and despatches from bonkersville; as pieces of fiction in their own right, authored by the usual mix of evangelists and the Very Angry. </p> <p>\"I have great fun reading through the readers' comments,\" says Pool at the Society of Authors. \"There was one gem on Aldous Huxley's Brave New World that went, 'I have only read one chapter, but I can already say that, apart from the Bible, this is my favourite book.' You can pretty quickly guess the nature of the reviewer.\" </p> <p>And even if you can't, there is nothing Amazon can do without releasing the contributors' email addresses and they won't do that. Editors at the site take a cursory glance at incoming messages to scout for obscenity but, whilst agreeing that Duchen and Pullman's cases are \"unfortunate\", fail to see what they can do about it. \"We prefer people with vested interests to identify themselves,\" says Judith Catton at the British arm of the company. \"But we can't control it if they don't. We want both good and bad reviews, because it creates debate.\" </p> <p>She is unlikely to face much opposition. Given the choice, after all, most authors would opt for bogus reviews over no reviews at all.</p>",

Authors' much savoured grumble - that, like theatre reviewers, book critics allow professional jealousy to colour their reviews since they are all failed novelists - holds no sway at Amazon, where members of the public provide the bulk of review copy. Those dear, guileless readers have, over the past year, posted 1,921 reviews of Thomas Harris's Hannibal, 370 of Michael Crichton's Timeline, 91 of Alex Garland's The Beach and enjoyed snippy exchanges about the value of the opinions. The concept of a \"reading community\", once defunct almost to the point of oxymoron, suddenly leapt to life and threatened to wrest critical opinion away from the professionals and hand it to the readers. As with most internet forums, Amazon's comment section attracted a fair share of cranks and morons, its \"horrible book - I could have written better\" rants that sensible authors ignored. But the site's combination of anonymity and vast exposure also enabled what Duchen believes to be a more damaging line of spite. Philip Pullman agrees. Pullman's forthcoming book, The Amber Spyglass, has been promoted on Amazon for the past couple of months. In December, the Oxford author received an unexpected call from his US publicists, who had logged on to the book's promotional page and noted with alarm that the section dedicated to author's comments had been filled in by an impostor. \"It was completely illiterate stuff,\" says Pullman. \"Any old twit can log on and review a book, or click on the 'I am the Author' button and post up a load of old rubbish. They hadn't even spelled my name right.\" Amazon swiftly removed the posting, but not before Pullman had converted his initial amusement into anger. \"God knows how many people saw it,\" he says with a shudder. \"The review was posted last February,\" says Duchen of her own misfortune. \"I didn't check it until September and thought, 'My God, what is this?'\" The Korngold biography was Duchen's first book. It was reviewed in the major music magazines and received largely favourable notices, although she insists she wasn't over-sensitive about the bad ones. \"I thought the criticisms were fair and well-expressed. But this was different. It referred to talks I had done on Korngold, outlining my intentions to stir up enthusiasm for the music. The reviewer said this was exactly what I hadn't done. There was a sense that here was a person being nasty for the sake of it.\" Duchen is a critic herself and suspects the phantom reviewer is someone she has crossed in a former article. It is not altogether paranoid. \"Duchen had a point,\" says Kate Pool, editor of the Author magazine. Duchen referred her concerns to the magazine's parent organisation, the Society of Authors, which sustained a \"very lively\" debate about it, but concluded nothing could be done. \"We have always been aware of the potential for trouble,\" says Pool. \"But the whole essence of the internet is freedom of expression, and how could you regulate it anyway?\" Publicly, publishers sympathise with their authors' vulnerability to Amazon's maverick reviewers. Privately, however, there is a sense that they have more to lose in reforming the system. \"We have regular discussions about this area of online reviewing,\" says Joanna Prior, head of publicity at Penguin Books. \"It is open to people using it in a malicious way. I don't know how you would prevent it.\" Don't hold your breath for suggestions. Publishers aren't as innocent in all this as might be expected and, while it is unlikely that they'd stoop to trashing rival books on Amazon, there is little doubt that they use it as an extension of their sales pitch. \"As a publisher, one is tempted to add in favourable reviews about our books,\" admits Katie James, head of Macmillan publicity. \"We have done it once or twice, pretending to be members of the public.\" She giggles. \"I mean, we are members of the public, but we have a professional vested interest.\" The admissions are just as frank at Penguin. \"The more editorial information there is on a book, the more likely people are to buy it,\" says Prior. \"I encourage staff, not necessarily associated with the book, to review it on Amazon. It is a free advert.\" Evidence for this is manifest in the reviews one finds that are dated before the official publication of the book, a discreet indication that they emanate from within the author's publishing house. \"Allowing anonymity opens the service to too much misuse,\" says Duchen. \"If you are honest, you don't need the protection of anonymity. It is an invitation for people to start inventing things.\" But as far as Amazon customers are concerned, the possibility of invention is half the fun of browsing the reviews. Like most features on the internet, you are never quite sure of what is real and what is hoax. The customer comments are valuable, not as measured criticisms, but as gut reactions, spicy dialogues and despatches from bonkersville; as pieces of fiction in their own right, authored by the usual mix of evangelists and the Very Angry. \"I have great fun reading through the readers' comments,\" says Pool at the Society of Authors. \"There was one gem on Aldous Huxley's Brave New World that went, 'I have only read one chapter, but I can already say that, apart from the Bible, this is my favourite book.' You can pretty quickly guess the nature of the reviewer.\" And even if you can't, there is nothing Amazon can do without releasing the contributors' email addresses and they won't do that. Editors at the site take a cursory glance at incoming messages to scout for obscenity but, whilst agreeing that Duchen and Pullman's cases are \"unfortunate\", fail to see what they can do about it. \"We prefer people with vested interests to identify themselves,\" says Judith Catton at the British arm of the company. \"But we can't control it if they don't. We want both good and bad reviews, because it creates debate.\" She is unlikely to face much opposition. Given the choice, after all, most authors would opt for bogus reviews over no reviews at all.",

      "body": "<p>Have you made the typical New Year's Resolutions: lose weight, quit smoking, drink less? How about one more for the hi-tech millennium? Learn to search the web better. Here's a search exercise plan to get you into shape. </p> <p>First, it helps to understand the basics of how search engines get their listings. There are two main ways: human beings or automated \"crawlers\". </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\" target=\"_new\">Yahoo</a> is a great example of a search engine that uses human beings. Its editors classify websites into different categories. So a search for \"travel\" reveals categories such as Travel Booksellers, Travel Companies and Hawaiian Travel. Click on a topic, and you'll be shown a list of sites that an editor has selected for that particular category. </p> <p>In contrast, a search engine like <a href=\"http://www..altavista.com\" target=\"_new\">AltaVista</a> sends robot crawlers out across the web to read automatically a large number of pages. The text is stored in what you can think of as a big book. So when you search for \"travel\", AltaVista flips through its book to displays links to all the individual web pages it has found with those words. </p> <p>In general, use a human-powered search engine when looking for answers to something general. But for something specific, such as \"places to stay in Fort William\", a crawler-based search engine may be more helpful. </p> <p>It is also helpful to understand basic search engine \"maths\". This means that by using symbols such as + or -, you can get better search results. </p> <p>For instance, say you were looking for \"football\" and kept getting answers about the NFL, the National Football League in the United States. Try searching again like this: football-nfl </p> <p>The minus symbol tells the search engine to look for pages that say football then to subtract any pages which contain the word NFL. That makes it more likely you'll get pages about Manchester United, rather than the Miami Dolphins! </p> <p>In fact, you can use the + symbol to get even closer to Man U. Try a search like this: football +manchester +united </p> <p>That tells the search engine to find all the pages with football on them, then to show you only pages that also say \"manchester\" and \"united\". </p> <p>If you were seeking Manchester United information, then the best way would be to search like this: \"manchester united\". </p> <p>Using the quote marks around a series of words tells the search engine to return only pages with that exact phrase on them, in that exact order which greatly increases the odds that they'll be about Manchester United. </p> <p>By searching in lower-case, you'll find both lower and upper-case versions of your words at all major search engines. So save your fingers and stay off the shift key! </p> <p>Another search tip is to always be specific. For instance, if you want to buy tickets for Manchester United matches online, then search that way, such as: Where can I buy tickets for Manchester United matches online? </p> <p>It's fine to use natural language queries like this on any search engine - you don't need to use only Boolean commands or even the maths commands described above. Just start with a specific query, and you may find what you are looking for without having to resort to other attempts. </p> <p>Another way to get better results can be to use multiple search engines. No two search engines are exactly the same, and if you use only one, you might miss good results that another might have. Since they are all free, don't be afraid to try a couple when searching the web. </p> <p>You can even send your query to multiple search engines at the same time, using metasearch engines. Also called metacrawlers, these sites save you time by forwarding your query to several major search engines then bringing back the results to one place. There is even metasearch software that brings back answers from multiple places to sort through. </p> <p>Finally, have you every looked for something to do with Britain and come back with a load of results that made you feel like the entire web is American? Next time, try a British search engine. These services make an extra attempt to ensure the sites they list are either British or about Britain. Just be sure to use the UK option usually located near the search box. </p> <p><strong> The best places to start looking</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Yahoo </strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://uk.yahoo.com\" target=\"_new\">Yahoo.co.uk</a></p> <p> The oldest major human-powered search engine on the web, and a great starting place for any search. Has UK or webwide search abilities.</p> <p> <strong> AltaVista </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.altavista.co.uk \">www.altavista.co.uk</a> </p> <p> Crawler-based service that's an excellent choice for finding unusual or very specific information.

      "bodyText": "Have you made the typical New Year's Resolutions: lose weight, quit smoking, drink less? How about one more for the hi-tech millennium? Learn to search the web better. Here's a search exercise plan to get you into shape. First, it helps to understand the basics of how search engines get their listings. There are two main ways: human beings or automated \"crawlers\". Yahoo is a great example of a search engine that uses human beings. Its editors classify websites into different categories. So a search for \"travel\" reveals categories such as Travel Booksellers, Travel Companies and Hawaiian Travel. Click on a topic, and you'll be shown a list of sites that an editor has selected for that particular category. In contrast, a search engine like AltaVista sends robot crawlers out across the web to read automatically a large number of pages. The text is stored in what you can think of as a big book. So when you search for \"travel\", AltaVista flips through its book to displays links to all the individual web pages it has found with those words. In general, use a human-powered search engine when looking for answers to something general. But for something specific, such as \"places to stay in Fort William\", a crawler-based search engine may be more helpful. It is also helpful to understand basic search engine \"maths\". This means that by using symbols such as + or -, you can get better search results. For instance, say you were looking for \"football\" and kept getting answers about the NFL, the National Football League in the United States. Try searching again like this: football-nfl The minus symbol tells the search engine to look for pages that say football then to subtract any pages which contain the word NFL. That makes it more likely you'll get pages about Manchester United, rather than the Miami Dolphins! In fact, you can use the + symbol to get even closer to Man U. Try a search like this: football +manchester +united That tells the search engine to find all the pages with football on them, then to show you only pages that also say \"manchester\" and \"united\". If you were seeking Manchester United information, then the best way would be to search like this: \"manchester united\". Using the quote marks around a series of words tells the search engine to return only pages with that exact phrase on them, in that exact order which greatly increases the odds that they'll be about Manchester United. By searching in lower-case, you'll find both lower and upper-case versions of your words at all major search engines. So save your fingers and stay off the shift key! Another search tip is to always be specific. For instance, if you want to buy tickets for Manchester United matches online, then search that way, such as: Where can I buy tickets for Manchester United matches online? It's fine to use natural language queries like this on any search engine - you don't need to use only Boolean commands or even the maths commands described above. Just start with a specific query, and you may find what you are looking for without having to resort to other attempts. Another way to get better results can be to use multiple search engines. No two search engines are exactly the same, and if you use only one, you might miss good results that another might have. Since they are all free, don't be afraid to try a couple when searching the web. You can even send your query to multiple search engines at the same time, using metasearch engines. Also called metacrawlers, these sites save you time by forwarding your query to several major search engines then bringing back the results to one place. There is even metasearch software that brings back answers from multiple places to sort through. Finally, have you every looked for something to do with Britain and come back with a load of results that made you feel like the entire web is American? Next time, try a British search engine. These services make an extra attempt to ensure the sites they list are either British or about Britain. Just be sure to use the UK option usually located near the search box. The best places to start looking Yahoo Yahoo.co.uk The oldest major human-powered search engine on the web, and a great starting place for any search. Has UK or webwide search abilities.

The spur to write Storm Damage was the funeral of a teenager from the home, one of two dead children to whom the film is dedicated. </p> <p>\"My foster mother wanted to create a family home. For me, she had made a place that I felt I could always go back to, and that was what she was trying to do for these kids.

But everybody knew this kid who died, and that if you fought him, you had to hope the police would come soon, or that you killed him before he killed you. Yet outside that he really was a sweetheart, a charming boy. </p> <p>\"When I wrote Storm Damage it was with the sense that these kids had gone, 'I'm going to do what I've got to do to make sure I'm all right.'

He was slated to play Adrian Lester's foster brother, but director Cellan Jones thought that playing against type would add more weight to James's character. Certainly, it's different from his most memorable turn to date, playing the sensitive cop Matt Lomas in the BBC drama Undercover Heart.

      "trailText": "<p>Garbo, Valentino, Fairbanks - Carl Davis has worked with all of them.  Michael Billington meets the composer who brought life to more than 30 classics of the silver screen</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Carl Davis is a man with a mission. Or, rather, several missions. One is to renew the audience for classic silent films - which is why he has composed scores for more than 30 features. Another is to win over a lost generation to good music - which is why he stages summer concerts in big tops and football stadiums and is even prepared, on occasion, to don bizarre costumes. But although there's a touch of the showman in the jovial Davis, he seriously believes that music is everyone's birthright and that no one should be barred from enjoying it by lack of either income or education. \"The arts should no more be governed by profit than the underground or the health service,\" he proclaims. </p> <p>At the moment, though, sex is very much on his mind - more precisely, the allure of Greta Garbo, who stars in the 1926 classic Flesh and the Devil, which on Saturday gets a rare screening at the Royal Festival Hall with Davis conducting his own score with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Garbo plays a femme fatale who wrecks the friendship between two Prussian soldiers, and the film is famous for several reasons: for Garbo's torrid on- and off-screen affair with co-star John Gilbert, for Clarence Brown's pioneering use of horizontal love scenes and for technical devices like the minute light bulb Brown put in the tip of Gilbert's cigarette to give the lovers an extra glow. </p> <p>For Davis, who premiered his score in 1982, the challenge lies in matching the movie's eroticism. \"The thing that influenced the musical style is that it's Garbo for the first time being the Garbo we know and recognise. It was her third Hollywood film and up to that point she wasn't a great success. But here the lighting, her performance and the fact that she was having an affair with Gilbert - the love scenes went on long after the director shouted 'Cut!' - all come into play. What I try to do is be part of the make-up and lighting department and make sure that musically she also glows. Before her arrival I've used Strauss-style marches for the scenes in the military barracks and quasi-Wagnerian music for the big blood-oath sworn between the two men. But suddenly Garbo appears and the whole film takes on another dimension along with the sound. I haven't overdone the score when she's around but I've used Mahlerian, even Bergian echoes because the music has to shimmer like the star.\" </p> <p>Davis, 63, has been composing scores for silent classics ever since the landmark restoration of Abel Gance's Napol\u00e9on in 1980, and is now expert at writing music that complements the screen image. But how exactly does he set about creating scores which, in the case of Napol\u00e9on, required a mammoth five hours of continuous music? </p> <p>\"In a modern film you work with a shot list that tells you where music is needed second by second. With a silent film, it's different. In order to learn the film, I actually write a book. I study the film in great detail, using the timings shown on the screen.

      "bodyText": "Carl Davis is a man with a mission. Or, rather, several missions. One is to renew the audience for classic silent films - which is why he has composed scores for more than 30 features. Another is to win over a lost generation to good music - which is why he stages summer concerts in big tops and football stadiums and is even prepared, on occasion, to don bizarre costumes. But although there's a touch of the showman in the jovial Davis, he seriously believes that music is everyone's birthright and that no one should be barred from enjoying it by lack of either income or education. \"The arts should no more be governed by profit than the underground or the health service,\" he proclaims. At the moment, though, sex is very much on his mind - more precisely, the allure of Greta Garbo, who stars in the 1926 classic Flesh and the Devil, which on Saturday gets a rare screening at the Royal Festival Hall with Davis conducting his own score with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Garbo plays a femme fatale who wrecks the friendship between two Prussian soldiers, and the film is famous for several reasons: for Garbo's torrid on- and off-screen affair with co-star John Gilbert, for Clarence Brown's pioneering use of horizontal love scenes and for technical devices like the minute light bulb Brown put in the tip of Gilbert's cigarette to give the lovers an extra glow. For Davis, who premiered his score in 1982, the challenge lies in matching the movie's eroticism. \"The thing that influenced the musical style is that it's Garbo for the first time being the Garbo we know and recognise. It was her third Hollywood film and up to that point she wasn't a great success. But here the lighting, her performance and the fact that she was having an affair with Gilbert - the love scenes went on long after the director shouted 'Cut!' - all come into play. What I try to do is be part of the make-up and lighting department and make sure that musically she also glows. Before her arrival I've used Strauss-style marches for the scenes in the military barracks and quasi-Wagnerian music for the big blood-oath sworn between the two men. But suddenly Garbo appears and the whole film takes on another dimension along with the sound. I haven't overdone the score when she's around but I've used Mahlerian, even Bergian echoes because the music has to shimmer like the star.\" Davis, 63, has been composing scores for silent classics ever since the landmark restoration of Abel Gance's Napol\u00e9on in 1980, and is now expert at writing music that complements the screen image. But how exactly does he set about creating scores which, in the case of Napol\u00e9on, required a mammoth five hours of continuous music? \"In a modern film you work with a shot list that tells you where music is needed second by second. With a silent film, it's different. In order to learn the film, I actually write a book. I study the film in great detail, using the timings shown on the screen. Not only do I write down in longhand what's happening in each scene, but I also work out the story's structure - where the paragraphs and chapter divisions are. It's a long process but then I sit down to write the score without referring to the pictures at all because I've taken away an impression. \"One also has to find a style appropriate to the work: romantic melodrama with Flesh and the Devil, historical pageant with Napol\u00e9on, swashbuckling epic with [the Douglas Fairbanks movie] The Iron Mask, which I recently did for the London Film Festival. In a sense, it's more like writing an opera or ballet than conventional movie music - you provide the complete sound picture.\" What changed Davis's life was the premiere showing of Napol\u00e9on in 1980.

She started acting with Max Reinhardt's theatre company in Berlin, where she appeared in The Weaker Sex and Private Lives, as well as Elizabeth of Austria in Sissi in Vienna. Her name was changed by Louis B Mayer to Lamarr after the silent screen beauty Barbara LaMarr, and also because he thought Kiesler sounded too much like a Yiddish slang word for buttocks. </p> <p>It certainly wasn't her acting that obtained her an MGM contract. As Hedy Kiesler, the 18-year-old had gained international notoriety by appearing fleetingly naked in a couple of scenes in Ecstasy (1932), a Czech film directed by Gustav Machaty. Pope Pius XII denounced it, Hitler banned it, and the offending scenes were excised from most European and American versions. It was much ado about nothing on. The film itself, shot partly on location, is full of lyrical beauty and stylish eroticism, and Hedy's \"kiesler\" is hardly seen. Her husband, German munitions magnate Fritz Mandl, a man in his 50s, spent millions trying to buy up all the prints of the film. As his decorative wife, she entertained dinner guests such as Gustav Mahler, Frantz Werfel, as well as Hitler and Mussolini. </p> <p>Finally, disguising herself as one of her servants, she fled to Paris by train with enough jewels to pay for her passage to New York on board the Normande, on which she met Louis B Mayer. Before the liner had docked, she had secured a new name and a seven-year contract starting at $500 a week. Mayer personally supervised every detail of her star grooming though he was uncertain of what to do with her. </p> <p>In fact, Mayer loaned her out to Walter Wanger for her Hollywood debut in Algiers (1938), in which Charles Boyer did not say, \"Come with me to the Casbah,\" though the phrase stuck to him for most of his life. Lamarr was ravishing enough to tempt the fugitive Boyer out of the Casbah, into her arms and those of the police. More exoticism came in Lady of the Tropics (1939), her first MGM movie after two years under contract. The film, co-starring Robert Taylor, flopped, despite the publicity line of \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\". </p> <p>I Take This Woman (1940), starring Spencer Tracy and Lamarr, took two years to reach the screen, by which time it had been dubbed I Retake This Woman; it had been in and out of production for 18 months with three changes of director and miles of rejected footage. The marital melodrama failed to ignite the public, and Mayer cooled towards Hedy. She only got fourth billing in Boom Town (1940), below Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert and Spencer Tracy, playing \"the other woman\", a role she also took in HM Pulham Esquire (1941), this time enlivening staid Robert Young's existence. </p> <p>As Dolores \"Sweets\" Ramirez in Tortilla Flat (1942), she gave what she herself considered her best performance, and if the film had been a success, MGM might have found better roles for her. Certainly better than the sultry hip-swinging half-caste whispering \"I am Tondelayo\" in White Cargo (1942). At first, MGM considered her for Gaslight (1944), but the studio had lost faith in her, giving the role to Ingrid Bergman instead, who won an Oscar. This led to Lamarr leaving MGM in 1945 to form her own production company, for which she played a number of femme fatales in rather dreary soap operas. </p> <p>She was virtually a has-been when Cecil B DeMille chose her to play the most famous femme fatale of all in Samson And Delilah (1949). In it, she looked gorgeous in a number of Old Testament off-the-shoulder creations by Edith Head, and managed satisfactorily to deliver lines like, \"I shall find the swiftest camels in Gaza, my silver will open the gates that bar your way. All Gaza will be there.\" Samson And Delilah was by far the biggest box-office hit of her career, which seemed about to be relaunched. But when Cecil B.DeMille offered her a role in The Greatest Show on Earth she declined, because she found the director too autocratic, and disliked his obsession with her feet. </p> <p>She made only a few more films, including a Western, Copper Canyon (1950), opposite Ray Milland, took the title role in My Favourite Spy (1951) in which she got an unreluctant Bob Hope in her clutches, and was Joan of Arc screaming \"Attack!\" to her minions in the ludicrous The Story of Mankind (1957). Her final film was The Female Animal (1958), in which she virtually played herself as an ageing movie star. </p> <p>But retirement did not keep her out of the headlines. She was arrested for shoplifting in 1966 and again in 1991, when she allegedly took $25 worth of toiletries from a Florida chemist. She was cleared of the charge both times. She also became litigious, suing the ghost writers of her titillating autobiography Ecstasy and Me, as well as Mel Brooks for using her name without permission in Blazing Saddles, in which a character called Hedley Lamarr is infuriated by being continually called Hedy Lamarr. She gained nothing on both occasions, and was forced to sell many of her valuable possessions. </p> <p>She was married six times: her second husband was screenwriter Gene Markey, her third the actor John Loder (with whom she had two children), her fourth was Texas oil millionaire W Howard Lee, the fifth restaurateur-bandleader Ernest Stauffer, and lastly, her own divorce lawyer, Lewis W Boles Jr. </p> <p>Another aspect of her life was revealed only recently.

The fastest-known Test hundred in terms of balls faced is 56, by Viv Richards for West Indies v England at St John's, Antigua, in 1985-86. It's hard to believe that Engineer's was quicker than that. However, it was a magnificent attacking innings - he was facing a top-class bowling attack, in Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith, Garry Sobers and Lance Gibbs.

He was a dependable middle-order batsman, with a workmanlike rather than classical technique, who reached 1000 runs in a season 16 times. He was particularly effective in one-day cricket, where his trademark was scampering between the wickets and sliding into the crease like a baseball player. He received a late England call-up at 33, and made a monumental 158 in 648 minutes at Auckland in 1977-78 in only his second Test. He toured Australia in 1978-79, but was hit in the face early on and didn't play another Test, finishing with 481 runs (48.10) from eight matches.

Victims have become a magical category, hijacked to justify any erosion of rights because most people can imagine themselves being victims and can't imagine needing legal aid or or a jury.</p> <p>This is a well-honed, public relations mantra.

People like me are appalled by this change to the jury system, but not through ritual adherence to tradition. It is concern about taking a fundamental right away from the citizen, giving the choice about jury trial to magistrates who are largely white and middle-class and not legally qualified. Magistrates do a great job, indeed they handle 97% of all criminal cases, most of which are pleas of guilty. And they come cheap. However, anyone who sits on cases too regularly tends to become case hardened, and cynical about the people who appear in the dock. If I were facing a theft charge or a charge of assault, I would most certainly want the fresh eyes and breadth of human experience that comes with the jury.

However, they affected every citizen in the same way. Jury trial was removed for criminal damage under a certain value and assault on the police became a summary offence, but these changes affected rich and poor, black and white alike. The potential for discrimination with this new legislation is considerable. It is socially and racially divisive. It is as though the debates around Stephen Lawrence's death exist inside a box marked \"police\" and have no relevance to other parts of the justice system where there is also institutional racism.</p> <p>Jack Straw insists that the black community is deluded, citing research which shows black people faring slightly better than whites in the magistrates courts. This is probably because black people are consistently overcharged or wrongly charged in the first place. It has also been suggested to me that those statistics are distorted because the discrimination experienced by black people is shared by the Irish and other minority groups. Placed in the white group, they make the picture for black people look more favourable than it actually is.</p> <p>The other argument spun by the home office is that the Scots do not get to choose the mode of trial, so why should the English? It seems a madness to me that this is being argued when there should be growing recognition that law is cultural and not a set of transferable rules. That is why Britain is resisting those in Europe who want all-consuming legal harmonisation. Jack Straw expresses concern at the rise of rightwing English nationalism in the wake of devolution, but instead of pointing up the good and decent things which are distinctly English he argues for cherrypicking of the Scottish system, which is different on so many counts. These cases would be tried by a judge in Scotland, either with or without a jury, and when he or she does sit without a jury the maximum power of sentencing is three months imprisonment with no power to commit to a higher court for sentence. A very different and more severe set of powers rest with magistrates south of the border.</p> <p>The cost and time-saving arguments are also now exposed as a nonsense. Obliged by the new human rights act to include a right of appeal from the magistrates' decision, there will have to be legal aid for that and cases will ping-pong between the courts. If this is to stop people electing trial and then pleading guilty at the crown court, all you have to do is create sticks and carrots: last-minute pleas can carry additional penalties.

A court order gave the disgraced former Conservative minister until Tuesday night to provide the names of anyone who had put up more than \u00a35,000. A letter received by Mr Fayed's solicitors at 5.25pm on that day listed a sole Hamilton supporter, thought to be the Earl of Portsmouth. The letter also said that neither Mr Hamilton nor his legal team knew the identity of any other wealthy backers, and invited Mr Fayed to contact Lord Harris of High Cross, who co-ordinated the fighting fund. Laurie Mayer, Mr Fayed's spokesman, described the response as delaying tactics, and said the Harrods owner would be seeking a court hearing to force Mr Hamilton to comply with the court order. \"This disappointing reply appears to be an attempt to drag matters out for as long as possible and to compel Mr Fayed to waste as much time and money on legal costs as is necessary,\" said Mr Mayer. In their attempts to recover Mr Fayed's \u00a31m legal costs, his solicitors are now seeking an early court hearing - which may take place at the high court in London next week - and have written to Lord Harris.

      "body": "<p>Shock waves from Tony Blair's pledge to increase NHS spending to European levels have been reverberating across Whitehall from the moment the microphones were turned off on the Frost programme on Sunday morning. While the prime minister's intervention was just what the doctor ordered for Alan Milburn, other ministers were doing a simple calculation: does more money for the NHS mean there's nothing left for me? </p> <p>David Blunkett, for one, has asked whether the NHS commitment is compatible with the government's promise to raise the proportion of national output spent on schools and colleges and the rallying cry of \"education, education, education\". </p> <p>As a result, since Sunday both Downing Street and the treasury have been stressing the caveats carefully mentioned by Mr Blair on Sunday. Raising health spending is now \"an aspiration\" rather than a cast-iron pledge. </p> <p>So how do the numbers stack up? Britain currently spends 6.7% of GDP on health, compared to an EU average of 8%. Given that Britain's GDP is currently just short of \u00a3900bn, that would mean spending on the NHS would have to be around \u00a312bn higher at the end of a five-year-period to close the gap. That means above-inflation increases of around 5% for the next five years. </p> <p>In reality, the increase needed may be slightly higher than that, since the size of the UK economy will grow over the next five years, and the rest of Europe could spend more on health as their economies recover from the spending squeeze imposed as they tried to qualify for monetary union. </p> <p>On the face of it, bringing the NHS into line with other European health systems would empty Gordon Brown's war chest in one fell swoop. The latest treasury forecasts show that by 2003-04 the government will be running a current surplus of \u00a312bn. Mr Blunkett and others have been doing their sums: a \u00a312bn increase in NHS spending wipes out the surplus and leaves nothing for schools, transport, the police, Scotland, Wales and so on. It may also mean playing fast and loose with the chancellor's golden rule - which forbids him from borrowing money over the economic cycle for anything other than infrastructure projects - and Mr Brown is highly unlikely to agree to that. </p> <p>However, the true picture may be more favourable than the treasury is admitting. It is entirely plausible that the government will have enough money to spend an extra \u00a312bn on the NHS and find more money for other priorities. But this will depend on the economy continuing to do well and above-inflation increases in \"sin taxes\" on cigarettes and petrol. </p> <p>Underlying the government's arithmetic is the cautious assumption that the economy grows by 2.25% a year - its long-term trend for the past century. It uses this figure to work out tax revenues and projected spending.

      "bodyText": "Shock waves from Tony Blair's pledge to increase NHS spending to European levels have been reverberating across Whitehall from the moment the microphones were turned off on the Frost programme on Sunday morning. While the prime minister's intervention was just what the doctor ordered for Alan Milburn, other ministers were doing a simple calculation: does more money for the NHS mean there's nothing left for me? David Blunkett, for one, has asked whether the NHS commitment is compatible with the government's promise to raise the proportion of national output spent on schools and colleges and the rallying cry of \"education, education, education\". As a result, since Sunday both Downing Street and the treasury have been stressing the caveats carefully mentioned by Mr Blair on Sunday. Raising health spending is now \"an aspiration\" rather than a cast-iron pledge. So how do the numbers stack up? Britain currently spends 6.7% of GDP on health, compared to an EU average of 8%. Given that Britain's GDP is currently just short of \u00a3900bn, that would mean spending on the NHS would have to be around \u00a312bn higher at the end of a five-year-period to close the gap. That means above-inflation increases of around 5% for the next five years. In reality, the increase needed may be slightly higher than that, since the size of the UK economy will grow over the next five years, and the rest of Europe could spend more on health as their economies recover from the spending squeeze imposed as they tried to qualify for monetary union. On the face of it, bringing the NHS into line with other European health systems would empty Gordon Brown's war chest in one fell swoop. The latest treasury forecasts show that by 2003-04 the government will be running a current surplus of \u00a312bn. Mr Blunkett and others have been doing their sums: a \u00a312bn increase in NHS spending wipes out the surplus and leaves nothing for schools, transport, the police, Scotland, Wales and so on. It may also mean playing fast and loose with the chancellor's golden rule - which forbids him from borrowing money over the economic cycle for anything other than infrastructure projects - and Mr Brown is highly unlikely to agree to that. However, the true picture may be more favourable than the treasury is admitting. It is entirely plausible that the government will have enough money to spend an extra \u00a312bn on the NHS and find more money for other priorities. But this will depend on the economy continuing to do well and above-inflation increases in \"sin taxes\" on cigarettes and petrol. Underlying the government's arithmetic is the cautious assumption that the economy grows by 2.25% a year - its long-term trend for the past century. It uses this figure to work out tax revenues and projected spending. But the treasury believes the economy's trend rate of growth is now 2.5%, largely as a result of there being more people of working age. The difference between the two figures - an extra 0.25 percentage points of growth a year - sounds miniscule, but its impact on the government's finances would be considerable over time. On the basis that the economy's output is worth \u00a31trn, slightly higher growth means GDP is \u00a32.5 bn higher in the first year, but \u00a314bn higher in the fifth year. The cumulative increase in GDP would be around \u00a340bn, of which around two-fifths would be higher government spending. The second piece of good news for spending ministers is that the chancellor's fiscal numbers make two key assumptions, both of which make the public finances look worse than they actually are. One is that there will be no above-inflation increases in tobacco and fuel duties in future budgets following the decision to scrap the automatic real annual increases of 5% on smokers and 6% on drivers. Treasury projections are based on no real increases at all in the coming years, which would cost the government \u00a31.25 bn in 2000-01, building up to \u00a36bn by 2003-04. It seems probable that there will be above-inflation increases in sin taxes, particularly since any extra money raised from cigarettes has been earmarked for the NHS. The second treasury assumption is that unemployment is about to take a sharp turn for the worse. Mr Brown stashed away a total of \u00a35.25bn for the three-year period up to 2001-02 on the basis that unemployment would be 1.55m in the final quarter of 1999, 1.7m by the end of this year and 1.73m by the end of 2001.

      "bodyText": "Bitter hand-to-hand fighting was raging between Russian troops and Chechen guerrillas in the centre of Grozny yesterday in what appeared to be the climactic battle for control of the Chechen capital. Backed by salvoes of artillery shells and air cover, Russian troops advanced from several points on Minutka Square, just south of the centre and the scene of a massacre of Russian troops last month. The Russians said they had taken control of a key city centre bridge over the Sunzha river, a claim contested by the Chechens. \"The fighting in Grozny is getting increasingly intensive and fierce with every hour that passes,\" said Aslanbek Islamilov, chief of the Chechen forces in Grozny. \"Everything is destroyed in Grozny. My house was completely demolished,\" said Hazan Dukayev, a Grozny resident who has just fled east to the town of Gudermes which was visited yesterday by a Council of Europe delegation led by Lord Russell-Johnston. But despite the Russian advance to the city centre and predictions by the Kremlin that the city would fall this week, Malik Saidullayev, a prominent Chechen businessman loyal to Moscow, said the Russian military still had a long way to go to capture Grozny. \"The situation there is far from the one painted by the military reports. Vladimir Putin should double-check the reports because they are 70% untrue,\" he added. And a Chechen commander in the city told the Interfax news agency that the rebels were deliberately luring Russians into the city in order to ambush them. \"The real fighting in Grozny will begin only after Russian troops are drawn fully into the streets and advance to the city centre,\" said Mumadi Saidayev. \"We want armoured vehicles to appear on the streets since the mobile groups that know how to destroy armour are ready for that.\" He conceded the Chechen capital would fall to the Russians but warned that Moscow would pay a \"huge price\". He predicted that the Grozny fighters would spread guerrilla war across Chechnya after receiving orders to abandon the city. Despite the presence of foreign visitors in the region, the Russians pressed home their offensive and one of the Russian commanders, General Gennady Troshev, bluntly told the Europeans: \"The western public must understand that if the terrorists are not eliminated in Chechnya, they may turn up in Europe.\" He predicted that the war would be over by February 26, exactly one month before Vladimir Putin, prime minister and acting president, expects to be elected to succeed Boris Yeltsin. The Russian deputy prime minister in charge of Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, said the conflict would be under control by March. The Russian attempts to control the visit by the delegation from the Council of Europe - which is to consider suspending Russia's membership next week - backfired in Gudermes when local residents complained bitterly about the occupying forces. The Russians took Gudermes with barely a shot being fired in November and have repeatedly asserted that the locals are content to be living in a town garrisoned by the Russians. Mr Koshman is in the process of moving his administration there and has said it will be the new capital of the republic. But yesterday in Gudermes Lord Russell-Johnston was confronted by local women shouting: \"We want them out.\" \"Russia is pretending to own this land, but they treat us all like terrorists,\" one man told reporters travelling with the delegation. \"The Russians have created instability so they could destroy us completely.\" At a refugee camp in Ingushetia, west of Chechnya, the Council of Europe team was encircled by two rings of Russian troops and police in order to minimise the visitors' contact with the homeless Chechens who were shouting for help and support. \"The visit was totally controlled by the [Russian] interior ministry,\" said Peter Boukaert of Human Rights Watch in Ingushetia. Mr Saidullayev said he was negotiating with unnamed Chechen commanders who had not taken part in the war and that he was also in touch with aides to president Aslan Maskhadov of Chechnya.",

It is thought that new evidence of accounting irregularities, uncovered this week, triggered both the SFO move and Mr Clough's suspension. Versailles says its action against Mr Clough - who has been with the company since it was founded in 1989 - had been prompted by information supplied to it on Tuesday night. The group would not elaborate but it is believed one of the two teams of accountants currently combing the group's books has found new problems in terms of accounting irregularities. Baker Tilly are looking at the accounts on behalf of Versailles - which will be required to hand over their findings to the stock exchange - while PricewaterhouseCoopers are conducting an accounting investigation on behalf of Versailles's three bankers - Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and NatWest - who are together owed about \u00a365m.

(It would be tempting to say that Mr Campbell, like members of the royal family, cannot answer back. In fact, he spends his life doing little else. He prefers to get in his answer back before anyone has attacked him in the first place. However, since he isn't an MP - he's far too important to waste time in the Commons - he can't reply on the spot.) The Tory leader pointed out that a junior health minister had promised a 5% rise in NHS funding, whereas Mr Campbell had apparently back-tracked on this promise. \"You must be responsible for your own spokesman.\" The real question is whether Mr Campbell is responsible for Mr Blair, but let that pass. He sat in the gallery, chewing gum and looking pleased. Back came Mr Hague, yet again. There had been a 29% increase in fraud, he said, \"but in your answers it has gone up by 129%.\" At this fairly feeble riposte, the prime minister pulled out his most devastating weapon, the Maxim gun in his armoury: boredom. Gosh, he went on. There are quite large insects that have a shorter lifespan than Mr Blair's answer yesterday. He started with a general tour d'horizon of the French health system, and the various costs it inflicts upon patients and employers. We moved east to Germany for a similar investigation. As bats began to wake for their nocturnal quests, he moved on to the topic of the private finance initiative and its beneficent effect on patients. All over Britain workers were coming to their end of night shifts. Weary clubbers were trying to phone minicabs, but Mr Blair was still on about how private health would not help the NHS. \"Firstly,\" he said. Firstly? Were we no nearer lastly? \"Secondly!\" he exclaimed. \"If you want the true figures ... he proves he has no judgment ...\" Still it was not over. Next time I think I shall try reading the whole of Proust instead.",

      "body": "<p>Pledging to build the \"best multinational administration in the world,\" Neil Kinnock yesterday unveiled proposals for the most drastic reforms the European commission has seen in 40 years.</p> <p>Mr Kinnock, the vice-president for administrative reform, told the European parliament in Strasbourg that he wanted to create a \"modern public service\" in which \"the best in the commission would be typical of the commission\".</p> <p>In a move welcomed by the prime minister, Tony Blair, the former Labour party leader promised speedy changes which would ensure efficiency, accountability, transparency and responsibility in the 22,000-strong Brussels bureaucracy, which implements key areas of European union policy.</p> <p>\"It's root, branch, trunk and trees reform,\" Mr Kinnock quipped.</p> <p>Member states across the EU are anxious to see public faith restored in the commission. Nowhere is this more true than in Britain, where the debate over the single currency has yet to be resolved and where yesterday's Guardian/ICM poll showed opposition to the euro at a record high of 63%.</p> <p>Reform is a key commitment - if not the raison d' \u00eatre - of the new commission under Romano Prodi, which was created after Jacques Santer and his team resigned last year following damaging allegations of corruption, mismanagement, incompetence and cronyism.</p> <p>But critics of the heavily-trailed reform package complained yesterday that it did not address questions such as immunity from prosecution and the bewitching tax-free perks and allowances which have given Eurocrats a reputation for feather-bedding and leisurely lunches.</p> <p>\"They'll be shaking in their Gucci shoes,\" one former official remarked sarcastically.</p> <p>Mr Kinnock, facing difficult talks with six nervous staff unions, repeatedly insisted that he did not want to cut commission jobs or benefits. \"If we want a high-quality administration, we have to attract and retain high-quality people, and they don't come free,\" he said.</p> <p>But Franco Ianiello, head of the Renouveau et D\u00e9mocratie union, said last night: \"We are extremely concerned that the sort of reforms Mr Kinnock is proposing would create a big mess if they are all implemented at once.\"</p> <p>The British commissioner is likely to face calls for more radical changes, which some officials admit are long overdue, pointing to successful internal overhauls at the UN and the World Bank. Mr Kinnock praised the ability of the vast majority of staff, but pointed to problems of poor morale, slow promotion and mismanagement.</p> <p>\"Changing that is going to take time. But what we are doing is providing the equipment and the follow-through according to a very strict timetable, in order to achieve the change,\" he added.</p> <p>Mr Prodi pledged to make sweeping changes and vowed to react to the recommendations last year of three elder statesmen, or \"wise men\", who roundly condemned the Santer commission's management of public money.</p> <p>Mr Kinnock said the commission would revamp its recruitment and disciplinary procedures and set up a new audit service by May this year.</p> <p>A new deputy secretary-general is to be appointed to cut red tape and simplify procedures, while a body to oversee standards in public life - modelled on Britain's Nolan committee - will be created.</p> <p>The commission has already vowed to review the rotation of senior civil servants around departments and to ensure that each of the EU's 15 member states is fairly represented.</p> <p>Recent appointments have been made on merit rather than according to informal national quotas, though the French are annoyed that several key jobs have been given to British officials. With signs of a charm offensive to woo the Eurosceptic British press, Mr Blair's official spokesman said: \"The prime minister believes commission reform has to be the top strategic objective fundamental to rebuilding public confidence.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Neil has proven reform credentials, having reformed the Labour party.\"</p> <p>But the Tories' reaction was predictably negative. The shadow foreign secretary, John Maples, dismissed Mr Kinnock's proposals as \"too little, too late\".</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, said the proposals deserved \"a fair wind\".</p> <p>But he added: \"The test will be whether there is sufficient political will to match the rhetoric with real and lasting reform. The inadequacies of the commission have been a crucial factor in fuelling public discontent with the European union. The commission has a moral responsibility to put its house in order.\"</p> <p><b>Clean-up for commission</b><br> \u0095Strategic planning function to assist commissioners</p> <p>\u0095Deputy secretary-general to cut through red tape</p> <p>\u0095Internal audit service to be set up by May 1 to look at control and management</p> <p>\u0095Comprehensive human resources policy</p> <p>\u0095Audit progress board to ensure follow-up on recommendations</p> <p>\u0095Committee on standards in public life to supervise general code of conduct</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pledging to build the \"best multinational administration in the world,\" Neil Kinnock yesterday unveiled proposals for the most drastic reforms the European commission has seen in 40 years. Mr Kinnock, the vice-president for administrative reform, told the European parliament in Strasbourg that he wanted to create a \"modern public service\" in which \"the best in the commission would be typical of the commission\". In a move welcomed by the prime minister, Tony Blair, the former Labour party leader promised speedy changes which would ensure efficiency, accountability, transparency and responsibility in the 22,000-strong Brussels bureaucracy, which implements key areas of European union policy. \"It's root, branch, trunk and trees reform,\" Mr Kinnock quipped. Member states across the EU are anxious to see public faith restored in the commission. Nowhere is this more true than in Britain, where the debate over the single currency has yet to be resolved and where yesterday's Guardian/ICM poll showed opposition to the euro at a record high of 63%. Reform is a key commitment - if not the raison d' \u00eatre - of the new commission under Romano Prodi, which was created after Jacques Santer and his team resigned last year following damaging allegations of corruption, mismanagement, incompetence and cronyism. But critics of the heavily-trailed reform package complained yesterday that it did not address questions such as immunity from prosecution and the bewitching tax-free perks and allowances which have given Eurocrats a reputation for feather-bedding and leisurely lunches. \"They'll be shaking in their Gucci shoes,\" one former official remarked sarcastically. Mr Kinnock, facing difficult talks with six nervous staff unions, repeatedly insisted that he did not want to cut commission jobs or benefits. \"If we want a high-quality administration, we have to attract and retain high-quality people, and they don't come free,\" he said. But Franco Ianiello, head of the Renouveau et D\u00e9mocratie union, said last night: \"We are extremely concerned that the sort of reforms Mr Kinnock is proposing would create a big mess if they are all implemented at once.\" The British commissioner is likely to face calls for more radical changes, which some officials admit are long overdue, pointing to successful internal overhauls at the UN and the World Bank. Mr Kinnock praised the ability of the vast majority of staff, but pointed to problems of poor morale, slow promotion and mismanagement. \"Changing that is going to take time. But what we are doing is providing the equipment and the follow-through according to a very strict timetable, in order to achieve the change,\" he added. Mr Prodi pledged to make sweeping changes and vowed to react to the recommendations last year of three elder statesmen, or \"wise men\", who roundly condemned the Santer commission's management of public money. Mr Kinnock said the commission would revamp its recruitment and disciplinary procedures and set up a new audit service by May this year. A new deputy secretary-general is to be appointed to cut red tape and simplify procedures, while a body to oversee standards in public life - modelled on Britain's Nolan committee - will be created. The commission has already vowed to review the rotation of senior civil servants around departments and to ensure that each of the EU's 15 member states is fairly represented. Recent appointments have been made on merit rather than according to informal national quotas, though the French are annoyed that several key jobs have been given to British officials. With signs of a charm offensive to woo the Eurosceptic British press, Mr Blair's official spokesman said: \"The prime minister believes commission reform has to be the top strategic objective fundamental to rebuilding public confidence.\" He added: \"Neil has proven reform credentials, having reformed the Labour party.\" But the Tories' reaction was predictably negative. The shadow foreign secretary, John Maples, dismissed Mr Kinnock's proposals as \"too little, too late\". The Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, said the proposals deserved \"a fair wind\". But he added: \"The test will be whether there is sufficient political will to match the rhetoric with real and lasting reform. The inadequacies of the commission have been a crucial factor in fuelling public discontent with the European union. The commission has a moral responsibility to put its house in order.\" Clean-up for commission \u0095Strategic planning function to assist commissioners \u0095Deputy secretary-general to cut through red tape \u0095Internal audit service to be set up by May 1 to look at control and management \u0095Comprehensive human resources policy \u0095Audit progress board to ensure follow-up on recommendations \u0095Committee on standards in public life to supervise general code of conduct",

His only chance is last-minute clemency, but in a state run by George W Bush, that is a very slim chance indeed.</p> <p>In his five years as governor, Mr Bush has approved 116 executions, more than any other US governor in modern times. Lethal injections on death row in Huntsville have become so commonplace that they are barely noted in the press.</p> <p>Michael King, the editor of the Texas Observer, said: \"The politicians, both Democrat and Republican, always compete to say 'I killed more than you did'.\"</p> <p>Thus Mr Bush lost no popularity points for supporting a 1995 law aimed at shortening the delay between conviction and execution, known locally as the \"speed up the juice\" law. Nor was he taking a political risk when he opposed a bill to ban executions of the mentally handicapped or ill.</p> <p>That bill, if passed, would probably have spared the life of Larry Robison, who is due to be executed tomorrow. Robison is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic who was not covered for treatment by his family's health insurance.</p> <p>Despite their appeals for him to be cared for, he was continually released on the grounds he showed no signs of violence. In 1982, responding to voices he said were coming out of clocks, he murdered five people.</p> <p>The Texas board of pardons and paroles also has no history of making allowances for age. No clemency is expected for Glen McGinnis, who was 17 when he shot a laundry attendant in a bungled raid. He is due to die on January 25.</p> <p>Their deaths will almost certainly go unnoticed in a presidential campaign in which all the candidates support the death penalty, as do three out of four Americans.

      "bodyText": "Today will be just another execution day in Texas. David Hicks will be strapped on to a bed and lethal chemicals will be injected into his arm. His only chance is last-minute clemency, but in a state run by George W Bush, that is a very slim chance indeed. In his five years as governor, Mr Bush has approved 116 executions, more than any other US governor in modern times. Lethal injections on death row in Huntsville have become so commonplace that they are barely noted in the press. Michael King, the editor of the Texas Observer, said: \"The politicians, both Democrat and Republican, always compete to say 'I killed more than you did'.\" Thus Mr Bush lost no popularity points for supporting a 1995 law aimed at shortening the delay between conviction and execution, known locally as the \"speed up the juice\" law. Nor was he taking a political risk when he opposed a bill to ban executions of the mentally handicapped or ill. That bill, if passed, would probably have spared the life of Larry Robison, who is due to be executed tomorrow. Robison is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic who was not covered for treatment by his family's health insurance. Despite their appeals for him to be cared for, he was continually released on the grounds he showed no signs of violence. In 1982, responding to voices he said were coming out of clocks, he murdered five people. The Texas board of pardons and paroles also has no history of making allowances for age. No clemency is expected for Glen McGinnis, who was 17 when he shot a laundry attendant in a bungled raid. He is due to die on January 25. Their deaths will almost certainly go unnoticed in a presidential campaign in which all the candidates support the death penalty, as do three out of four Americans. But defence lawyers and human rights activists in Texas say that the state's record on capital punishment should be a national issue. \"A person may be condemned to die in Texas in a process that has the integrity of a professional wrestling match,\" said Stephen Bright, the director of the Southern Centre for Human Rights. There is no state public defender system in Texas and the courts assign poor defendants lawyers who are often on low pay and have few qualifications. One court assigned 14 death penalty appeals to two former law clerks with no experience in capital cases. Court-appointed defence lawyers have even been known to fall asleep during a trial. When asked why he had nodded off, a 72-year-old named John Benn told journalists: \"It's boring.\" In another capital case, the defence lawyer dispensed with a closing summary and proceeded to sing Home on the Range instead. But even if the defence lawyer is awake and competent, he is likely to be enmeshed in a web of political and financial obligations. Maurie Levin, who leads a fairly lonely campaign in Austin against the death penalty, said: \"Judges are elected, and attorneys are dependent on the court for their next job. \"And if a trial judge approves too much money for, God forbid, defence of a murderer, they would not be well-viewed in the next election. Everything is intertwined. There is no independence.\" A convicted murderer's last hope is the pardons board, an 18-member panel appointed by the governor, which decides on issues of clemency.

      "bodyText": "Investigators examining the wreck of the Solway Harvester, the fishing boat which sank in the Irish sea last week, have discovered the body of one of its seven crewmen. The body was discovered by underwater video cameras, probing the wrecked vessel on the seabed 11 miles off the Isle of Man. The scallop dredger is lying in 100ft of water and police said yesterday they were now considering raising the wreck. It has not yet been possible to identify the body, but investigators from the marine accident investigation branch now believe that all seven crewmen are on board the vessel. A survey vessel, the Mansal 18, which had been chartered by the board, returned to harbour yesterday and video evidence from the surveillance cameras was being examined in detail by investigators. The families of the fisherman are all anxious to have the bodies of the men returned home for burial. Mike Culverhouse, chief constable of the Isle of Man, said this would be the investigators' priority. Mr Culver house said the possibility of raising the vessel was being discussed. However, other courses of action to recover the bodies, including diving, were still under consideration. \"All parties will decide on the best course of action, but we want to make sure that whatever we do is within the bounds of safety,\" he added. The body was found on the gutting deck of the wreck, in the centre of the ship below the wheelhouse, by a camera lowered through a porthole. An MAIB spokesman said inspectors on the survey vessel had been able to leave the scene ahead of schedule because enough evidence had been gathered for them to conduct their inquiry. Families of the seven victims, all from the three villages of the tiny community of the Machars of Whithorn in south west Scotland, will travel to Douglas, the Isle of Man capital, if the bodies of the crewmen are raised. The seven were skipper Andrew Craig Mills, 29; his brother Robin Mills, 33; their cousin David Mills, 18; John Murphy, 22; Martin Milligan, 26; David Lyons, 17; and Wesley Jolly, 17.",

      "bodyText": "The Thatcher government held secret meetings with the wives of strikebreaking miners as part of a hidden strategy behind the greatest domestic crisis of the 1980s, it is revealed today. Participants have talked for the first time about four sessions held privately at the House of Commons and attended by the then energy minister, David Hunt, who reported the results directly back to the prime minister. Lady Thatcher was closely interested in the psychology of the split villages because of her own background, according to Elizabeth Peacock, the former Conservative MP for Batley and Spen in West Yorkshire, who helped to organise the meetings. She said yesterday: \"As a wife and mother Mrs T, as she was then, was very concerned about intimidation, all the more so when it took the form of banning strikebreakers' families from corner shops, which struck a chord with her own upbringing.\" The secret gatherings, described tonight on a BBC Close-up North investigation, Divided We Stand, also gave ministers useful insights on the pressures which drove some of the women to persuade their husbands to keep working in spite of the intimidation. The meetings were attended, but never publicly described, by the late Woodrow Wyatt, a key member of an informal group of advisers on breaking the 1984-85 strike. Angry references to intimidation of strikebreakers and their families peppered his News of the World column subsequently, but he gave no hint of the meetings and left them out of his memoirs. The MPs at the meetings were initially concerned about his presence because of his past Labour links, but said that \"he sat in a corner making copious notes and was clearly very discreet\". \"It was all behind the scenes and - remarkably for Westminster - never discovered by anyone else or reported,\" said Mrs Peacock, whose constituency's mining equipment firms made her part of an inner circle of concerned backbenchers regularly briefed by the then energy secretary, Peter Walker. \"Peter was marvellous at keeping people informed - never anything in writing, just calling you into his office to pass on the news. I think that is how these visits came about.\" The \"scab wives\", as they were known in tightly knit communities which detested strikebreakers, gave frightening accounts of smashed windows, slogans carved on the bricks of their houses and being treated like pariahs. Mr Hunt, whose brief as \"coal minister\" made him a principal player in a battle always portrayed by the government as entirely between the national coal board and the National Union of Mineworkers, passed the information straight on. Now Lord Hunt, he said: \"I found it very useful indeed to hear exactly what was happening and of course I took steps immediately afterwards to make the prime minister and other ministers aware of the extent of the intimidation.\" He also passed on accounts to the home secretary whose department coordinated police and covert operations during the bitter, 11-month dispute. No wives involved in the meetings have been prepared to talk openly about them, with divisions still strong in the pit villages and former coalfield areas after 16 years. But strikers' leaders expressed surprise yesterday at the scale of the operation. Peter Heathfield, general secretary of the NUM during the strike, said: \"We knew nothing about this. It's news to me.\" And Ken Capstick, prominent in the Yorkshire NUM during the 1980s, said: \"Mrs Thatcher always said that the government was nothing to do with it, that it was the business of the coal board and the NUM. In fact they were involved in it up to their necks.\"",

The duo said they believed all 40 species of hedylid had evolved moth-like hearing and that the insects that did not develop hearing aids decided instead to show up only when the bats had gone to bed.",

      "body": "<p>Londoners are in the unenviable position of living in the most expensive city in the European Union and the seventh most costly in the world, according to an international survey published today.</p> <p>Manchester enters the top part of the league for the first time, holding the joint number 20 position with Chicago and Schenzen, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's biannual cost of living rankings. Continuing its steady march up the global price index, London has leapfrogged Paris and Geneva for the first time, and now lags behind only Tokyo and Osaka in Japan, Libreville in Gabon, and the non-EU cities of Oslo and Zurich.</p> <p>The survey, which compares the cost of more than 120 goods and services, from a loaf of bread to a full-time maid, confirms Londoners' complaints that they face increasingly prohibitive prices, especially for food, transport and entertainment. For accommodation costs, only Tokyo and Hong Kong are more expensive.</p> <p>London first entered the world's top 10 most expensive places in December 1997. The rise from ninth to seventh position in the rankings over the past year is blamed mainly on the strong pound and the relative weakness of the euro.</p> <p>But Bill Ridgers, the report's editor, said the results would be taken as further evidence of the poor deal enjoyed by British consumers compared to their European counterparts.</p> <p>\"The latest change is almost entirely due to currency fluctuations but the fact that London has been consistently in such a high position brings up the whole rip-off Britain issue again.\"</p> <p>Business leaders also voiced concern that rising living costs are undermining the city's long-term economic prospects, making it too expensive for lower-paid workers, pushing up wage demands for employers, and discouraging companies from locating there.</p> <p>The EIU rankings, covering 126 countries, are regarded by multinational companies as a key guide when setting salary levels and considering relocation plans.</p> <p>\"We are concerned that London is becoming the most expensive city in the EU,\" said Simon Sperryn, chief executive of London chamber of commerce. \"The high cost of living and doing business in London could have serious implications for the capital's future competitiveness.\"</p> <p>Manchester's economic renaissance has taken it to 20th place in the rankings, making it as pricey as Chicago and dearer than every city in Germany, as well as Amsterdam and Helsinki. Dublin, by contrast, has become cheaper to live in over the past year, dropping from 34th to 48th place.</p> <p>European cities have the dubious distinction of holding six of the 10 most expensive places. Paris, consistently the EU's most expensive place, has fallen from fifth to eighth position. The Romanian capital, Bucharest, in 120th spot, is now the cheapest city in Europe.</p> <p>But even Londoners will feel a pang of sympathy for residents of Tokyo, who for the ninth year running find themselves topping the rankings.

      "bodyText": "Londoners are in the unenviable position of living in the most expensive city in the European Union and the seventh most costly in the world, according to an international survey published today. Manchester enters the top part of the league for the first time, holding the joint number 20 position with Chicago and Schenzen, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's biannual cost of living rankings. Continuing its steady march up the global price index, London has leapfrogged Paris and Geneva for the first time, and now lags behind only Tokyo and Osaka in Japan, Libreville in Gabon, and the non-EU cities of Oslo and Zurich. The survey, which compares the cost of more than 120 goods and services, from a loaf of bread to a full-time maid, confirms Londoners' complaints that they face increasingly prohibitive prices, especially for food, transport and entertainment. For accommodation costs, only Tokyo and Hong Kong are more expensive. London first entered the world's top 10 most expensive places in December 1997. The rise from ninth to seventh position in the rankings over the past year is blamed mainly on the strong pound and the relative weakness of the euro. But Bill Ridgers, the report's editor, said the results would be taken as further evidence of the poor deal enjoyed by British consumers compared to their European counterparts. \"The latest change is almost entirely due to currency fluctuations but the fact that London has been consistently in such a high position brings up the whole rip-off Britain issue again.\" Business leaders also voiced concern that rising living costs are undermining the city's long-term economic prospects, making it too expensive for lower-paid workers, pushing up wage demands for employers, and discouraging companies from locating there. The EIU rankings, covering 126 countries, are regarded by multinational companies as a key guide when setting salary levels and considering relocation plans. \"We are concerned that London is becoming the most expensive city in the EU,\" said Simon Sperryn, chief executive of London chamber of commerce. \"The high cost of living and doing business in London could have serious implications for the capital's future competitiveness.\" Manchester's economic renaissance has taken it to 20th place in the rankings, making it as pricey as Chicago and dearer than every city in Germany, as well as Amsterdam and Helsinki. Dublin, by contrast, has become cheaper to live in over the past year, dropping from 34th to 48th place. European cities have the dubious distinction of holding six of the 10 most expensive places. Paris, consistently the EU's most expensive place, has fallen from fifth to eighth position. The Romanian capital, Bucharest, in 120th spot, is now the cheapest city in Europe. But even Londoners will feel a pang of sympathy for residents of Tokyo, who for the ninth year running find themselves topping the rankings. The city's cost of living has risen by 26% in the past year thanks to the economy's revival - making it almost 30% dearer than Hong Kong in third place - and consumers now face exorbitant prices for basic foodstuffs. A 500g pack of supermarket cheese, for example, costs more than \u00a312 on average. At the opposite end of the scale, the Indian cities of New Delhi and Mumbai - formerly Bombay - have usurped Tripoli to become the least expensive places in the world. For less than the monthly rent of a one-bedroom flat in a moderate area of London, residents of New Delhi could live in a fully-furnished three-bedroom house. Tokyo: 25 tea-bags will set you back \u00a31.50 Whereas sightseers in most cities in the world gasp at architectural marvels or great works of art, visitors to Tokyo are just as often bowled over by the astonishing prices they encounter because of the strong yen and land values. Many supermarkets provide only hand baskets, perhaps because it is so expensive to fill up trolleys.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair last night warned Labour activists in London that it is \"time to get serious\" about the race to be Labour's candidate for mayor, telling them Ken Livingstone is not up to the job. Accusing the former GLC leader of \"gesture politics\" and of making a joke of controversial remarks, Mr Blair said: \"I tell you this job is no laughing matter. Crime in London is no joke. Poverty in London is no joke, these are serious issues. This is a serious job, we are a serious party.\" Addressing Labour members with the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in London, Mr Blair promised to back whoever emerges as Labour's candidate when the votes are counted in four weeks. But he made it clear that his former health secretary, Frank Dobson, \"would be the best man for the job\". \"He is experienced, serious, his own man, but a team player too,\" said Mr Blair. Mr Brown described Mr Dobson as \"a loyal member of the party\" who would argue in private but unite in public. Mr Blair said there was \"precious little evidence\" that Mr Livingstone has changed since the turbulent 1980s. Mr Brown yesterday used an article in the London Evening Standard to attack Mr Livingstone's policies. Six new taxes would hit the growth of new businesses in the capital of which there were 40,000 last year - and start \"an 80s-style economic policy and a re-run of the old fights over economic policy,\" the chancellor claimed. Mr Livingstone has attacked the chancellor's \"high interest rate and high sterling\" policies, saying they cost jobs. Mr Blair last night told party activists that the chancellor had done \"brilliantly\". Writing in today's Guardian, Mr Livingstone claims to be the victim of \"huge forces mobilised to stop me\" but insists London loves him. \"It is simply not possible to change Londoners' memories of what the GLC did,\" he said. He admits that he canvassed non-Labour academic experts such as Tony Travers and Peter Hall to join his cabinet - not itself a breach of Labour rules. \"Tony Blair has brought Liberals into a cabinet committee and appointed all sorts of Tory ex-cabinet ministers to all sorts of important posts. I'm just continuing with this inclusive tradition,\" he explained. But he denied a report in yesterday's Guardian that he was organising a slate for the elected Greater London Authority (GLA) that would help him run as an independent if Mr Dobson were to win the party nomination. Jim Fitzpatrick MP, the chairman of the Greater London Labour Party, said last night that Mr Livingstone would suffer an automatic, five-year expulsion from the party only if he filed independent nomination papers. Others, including Clive Soley, the chairman of the parliamentary Labour Party, argue that canvassing for would-be GLA candidates would render Mr Livingstone liable to disciplinary action for \"bringing the party into disrepute\" or \"attacking colleagues\". In his article, Mr Brown defended John Prescott's private partnership plan for restoring the London Underground and attacked the bond issue alternative backed by Liberal Democrats and Mr Livingstone. \"For Ken Livingstone the Tube has become an issue of economic dogma, ignoring the realities of getting the investment needed to improve everyday life for Londoners,\" said Mr Brown. He warned party voters: \"What would threaten jobs and put the economy at risk is to attack the very policies that are creating stability and steady growth - and then to advocate huge business and personal tax rises, an 80s-style economic policy and a re-run of the old fights over economic policy at the heart of the Labour Party.\" Tony Blair cites three examples to back his claim that Ken Livingstone has not changed: Blair's example 'The calls for Gordon Brown, rightly acknowledged throughout the party for his brilliant handling of the economy, to be sacked' Livingstone's reply 'I think Gordon should avoid this policy of high interest rates and an over-valued pound because we have lost 100,000 manufacturing jobs in 1999' Blair's example 'The revelation that Ken does not want to work with our party candidates, and instead is casting around for his own kitchen cabinet.' Livingstone's reply 'The mayor is allowed to appoint a cabinet and I have always made clear that it will not just be Labour party people. It will be anyone with a commitment to London' Blair's example 'Silly and offensive remarks about the riots in Seattle and his views on policing generally' Livingstone's reply 'There were no offensive remarks about [the disrupted World Trade Organisation conference in] Seattle. There was a series of jokes [in The Face magazine], the whole column was a series of jokes. It was only because the No 10 press office and Frank's campaign went berserk that anyone noticed'",

      "body": "<p>Hugo Isaac's face is a picture of concentration. He is driving a Volvo estate carefully through the Docklands in London. In the boot are two web servers worth more than \u00a370,000 and weighing about 100 kilos each. The internal systems manager is driving them to the high-security offices of a new ISP where he hopes they will soon be handling an enormous amount of cyber-based traffic. </p> <p>Back at <a href=\"http://www.moonfruit.com\" target=\"_new\">Moonfruit.com's</a> offices on Oxford Street, Nick Young, known as the \"bug man\", groans as news of yet another computer bug is emailed to him. He adds it to the list to be checked. Tonight he will go to design agency Sixzeds in Soho to sort it out. </p> <p>It's late morning and Wendy Tan, chief executive of Moonfruit.com, is back in the office. She's been working from 8am to midnight most days as well as weekends. Full of flu and drinking Lemsip, she says her partner kicked her out of bed so she didn't miss her meeting with a group of venture capitalists. As she disappears down the corridor, someone shouts: \"Go get us some cash, Wend!\" </p> <p>Welcome to the real world of internet start-ups. This is no place for laid back wannabe e-tycoons. It's fast-paced, highly pressurised and at times exhilarating. The hours are very long and it's impossible to predict some of the problems you have to face. </p> <p>This year thousands of UK internet start-ups will launch with the dream of joining the hallowed ranks of AOL/Time Warner, Yahoo and Microsoft. Whereas once it was said everyone had a book in them, now it appears everyone has a website in them. Already ad agencies are being deluged with demands for campaigns from fledgling dot.coms. By the end of 2000, there will be some successes but the virtual road to cyberspace is certain to be strewn with a large number of net casualties. </p> <p>One of the first start-ups to go boldly into cyberspace is the curiously-named Moonfruit. Barring any last minute unforeseen technical developments, Moonfruit aims to go officially live on the net today. The company is offering free website building kits created using the latest Flash-based technology. Moonfruit hopes UK surfers will use these Flash 4-inspired kits to build and develop their own online communities. </p> <p>But nothing runs smoothly on the internet as most start-ups know to their cost, and for Moonfruit the run up to launch has been immensely frustrating at times. Over the Christmas holiday, a number of technical difficulties were discovered while the service was being beta tested. Some pages were taking ages to download, bugs had surfaced affecting key functions, and the Moonfruit site could not always be accessed. Since then there has been a frenzied burst of activity. </p> <p> The technical team has been rigorously testing computers which meet the minimum specifications to see how well they support the product. Stopwatches have timed how quickly the average Freeserve user can get on to the site and use specific functions. </p> <p>The servers have been \"stress-tested\" to see if they can cope with hundreds of thousands of users, and as an additional safeguard, an idiot's guide to using the Moonfruit service has been produced and will be emailed out on request. </p> <p>The directors have brought in former British army captain and now start-up consultant Naunton Dickins to steady nerves and provide strategic advice. \"The directors are having to deal with everyone's feelings,\" he says. \"It is going up and down like a roller coaster due to technology frustrations. They have to keep the optimism going and keep the team blinkered from the tricky technology issues.\" </p> <p>But remaining optimistic has occasionally been too difficult for some members of the Moonfruit launch team. There have been days when Julia Maeda, customer service project manager has broken down in tears in the office. \"You think you know where you are going and then some feedback comes in and everything changes,\" she explains. \"Something might have happened on the internet or we might have suddenly discovered the product cannot do something.\" </p> <p>The walls of Moonfruit's offices are plastered with posters setting out conditions to be met before the launch. Moonfruit hopes the product speed is now right across all ISPs and browsers in the UK and wants inexperienced users to be able to build a site within about 30 minutes. But, given the rich diversity of the UK internet user market, these are extremely ambitious targets. How, for example, can you anticipate accurately the number of emails from customers? </p> <p>Moonfruit's chief executive, Wendy Tan was formerly e-commerce manager of Egg and she vividly remembers the lessons from its troublesome launch. \"Egg taught me how to cope with a situation which is totally uncertain without giving up. Moonfruit is about to become external. People are going to have a view of us and that is going to be a difficult experience for the whole business. They will either love it or they won't and that is a bit scary. It's like jumping off a cliff.\" </p> <p>Last November I joined Moonfruit on a part-time basis as a freelance writer. I wanted to get as much experience at first hand of what it's really like being in a start-up. Mainly I have been writing on-screen guidance. But it's been difficult. Some people thought it was too risky and others have questioned my independence as a freelance internet writer. But despite these legitimate concerns, and the fact that nearly every day someone confidently tells you that the internet bubble is about to burst, I decided to follow my instincts and join them. </p> <p>So far, Moonfruit has managed successfully to secure backing from Bainlab, the internet investment arm of management consultancy, Bain&amp;Co. The next major investment deal is about to be closed and accountants and lawyers are crawling all over the start-up, checking contracts and interviewing key staff. All this has been going on in the background as the launch date has crept closer. </p> <p>On the whole people appear to like the animated look and feel of the product but they are investing predominantly on potential. To date the company has no meaningful market share and has generated no profits. Like the development of the internet in general, no one really has a clue how far Moonfruit could actually go. </p> <p>But by and large the team at Moonfruit remains optimistic. The staff work on projects which can rapidly change and many say it makes a refreshing change to working in a traditional corporate environment where the roles are usually rigid. The chief executive and the chief technical officer of Moonfruit are both women and they say the new media industry offers them greater opportunities. </p> <p>For many internet entrepreneurs, cyberspace seems to promise a new world, the chance to create a new kind of company from scratch. Moonfruit is no exception. There is a strong sense of idealism running through the organisation. </p> <p>\"I would like Moonfruit to be a company which is a key force in generating exciting online communities and I want as many people here as possible to have a job they love,\" says launch director, Judith Clegg, who was previously operational development manager for Pret A Manger. On the web there are no physical tills and she has found the idea of no face-to- face contact with customers difficult. </p> <p>The hectic world of internet start-ups has a definite Alice in Wonderland-like feel. Moonfruit has backing, but no track record as a business and all the time it is burning cash. Chief financial officer David Stephens explains: \"The whole start-up business is about consuming cash on the promise that one day the jam will come. It is very difficult to generate cash at this stage. It is not possible to have revenues exceeding your costs because the development costs are on-going. </p> <p>\"We are trying to build a brand and market share. It is not like a normal business. The whole process is about running out of money and trying to get some more. Investors just trust us to spend it well.\" </p> <p>Moonfruit is pinning hopes of success on people using its new Flash 4 website kits to create large online communities in the UK which should in turn generate attractive amounts of traffic for potential advertisers. But when the company goes live, it is likely to be vigorously challenged by competitors like Homestead, FortuneCity and GeoCities - not to mention the many other leading portals which already have their own homepage building services. But Moonfruit believes its offering is more enjoyable and entertainment-orientated. </p> <p>At the back of their minds, the directors know that as soon as they launch on the net there is a risk that someone could copy them. Their success will also partly depend on how quickly they can respond to any customer demands for improvements. Already plans are being made for the next phase of the portal's development. </p> <p>The Moonfruit service has been designed in about six months by design agency Sixzeds which also works for the Big Issue and the London School of Economics. Visitors to the futuristic-looking Moonfruit portal enter an interactive online environment where they are met and guided by 3-D characters. </p> <p>Once registered, users can easily create and customise their own sites, selecting different coloured back grounds, typefaces and additional features such as databases by simply clicking with their mouse button. A range of quirky effects, including goldfish which make water-bubbling noises, are also available. Moonfruit's income from this venture will be generated through banner ads which will run at the foot of all the sites. </p> <p>As Moonfruit makes its final preparations before going live, the directors are trying hard to shake off the ghost of Boo.com's unsuccessful launch, which haunts every start-up these days. To avoid staff becoming too launch-centric, management strategy is to encourage people to look ahead to what they will be doing in February or March. But no one knows for certain. It depends largely where the customers and the product leads them. </p> <p>\"When UK web users get hold of a start-up's product, an awful lot of information floods in. There is always a risk that a company like Moonfruit will rock a bit,\" explains Dickins. \"The Moonfruit team have no choice but to keep their heads, be disciplined and stick to the processes and procedures which are now in place.\" </p> <p>There are potentially enormous pots of treasure at the end of the cyber rainbow. But clearly there is no easy ticket to fame and fortune.</p>",

There have been days when Julia Maeda, customer service project manager has broken down in tears in the office. \"You think you know where you are going and then some feedback comes in and everything changes,\" she explains. \"Something might have happened on the internet or we might have suddenly discovered the product cannot do something.\" The walls of Moonfruit's offices are plastered with posters setting out conditions to be met before the launch. Moonfruit hopes the product speed is now right across all ISPs and browsers in the UK and wants inexperienced users to be able to build a site within about 30 minutes. But, given the rich diversity of the UK internet user market, these are extremely ambitious targets. How, for example, can you anticipate accurately the number of emails from customers? Moonfruit's chief executive, Wendy Tan was formerly e-commerce manager of Egg and she vividly remembers the lessons from its troublesome launch. \"Egg taught me how to cope with a situation which is totally uncertain without giving up. Moonfruit is about to become external. People are going to have a view of us and that is going to be a difficult experience for the whole business. They will either love it or they won't and that is a bit scary. It's like jumping off a cliff.\" Last November I joined Moonfruit on a part-time basis as a freelance writer. I wanted to get as much experience at first hand of what it's really like being in a start-up. Mainly I have been writing on-screen guidance. But it's been difficult. Some people thought it was too risky and others have questioned my independence as a freelance internet writer. But despite these legitimate concerns, and the fact that nearly every day someone confidently tells you that the internet bubble is about to burst, I decided to follow my instincts and join them. So far, Moonfruit has managed successfully to secure backing from Bainlab, the internet investment arm of management consultancy, Bain&amp;Co. The next major investment deal is about to be closed and accountants and lawyers are crawling all over the start-up, checking contracts and interviewing key staff. All this has been going on in the background as the launch date has crept closer. On the whole people appear to like the animated look and feel of the product but they are investing predominantly on potential. To date the company has no meaningful market share and has generated no profits. Like the development of the internet in general, no one really has a clue how far Moonfruit could actually go. But by and large the team at Moonfruit remains optimistic. The staff work on projects which can rapidly change and many say it makes a refreshing change to working in a traditional corporate environment where the roles are usually rigid. The chief executive and the chief technical officer of Moonfruit are both women and they say the new media industry offers them greater opportunities. For many internet entrepreneurs, cyberspace seems to promise a new world, the chance to create a new kind of company from scratch. Moonfruit is no exception. There is a strong sense of idealism running through the organisation. \"I would like Moonfruit to be a company which is a key force in generating exciting online communities and I want as many people here as possible to have a job they love,\" says launch director, Judith Clegg, who was previously operational development manager for Pret A Manger. On the web there are no physical tills and she has found the idea of no face-to- face contact with customers difficult. The hectic world of internet start-ups has a definite Alice in Wonderland-like feel. Moonfruit has backing, but no track record as a business and all the time it is burning cash. Chief financial officer David Stephens explains: \"The whole start-up business is about consuming cash on the promise that one day the jam will come. It is very difficult to generate cash at this stage. It is not possible to have revenues exceeding your costs because the development costs are on-going. \"We are trying to build a brand and market share. It is not like a normal business. The whole process is about running out of money and trying to get some more. Investors just trust us to spend it well.\" Moonfruit is pinning hopes of success on people using its new Flash 4 website kits to create large online communities in the UK which should in turn generate attractive amounts of traffic for potential advertisers. But when the company goes live, it is likely to be vigorously challenged by competitors like Homestead, FortuneCity and GeoCities - not to mention the many other leading portals which already have their own homepage building services. But Moonfruit believes its offering is more enjoyable and entertainment-orientated. At the back of their minds, the directors know that as soon as they launch on the net there is a risk that someone could copy them. Their success will also partly depend on how quickly they can respond to any customer demands for improvements. Already plans are being made for the next phase of the portal's development. The Moonfruit service has been designed in about six months by design agency Sixzeds which also works for the Big Issue and the London School of Economics. Visitors to the futuristic-looking Moonfruit portal enter an interactive online environment where they are met and guided by 3-D characters. Once registered, users can easily create and customise their own sites, selecting different coloured back grounds, typefaces and additional features such as databases by simply clicking with their mouse button. A range of quirky effects, including goldfish which make water-bubbling noises, are also available. Moonfruit's income from this venture will be generated through banner ads which will run at the foot of all the sites. As Moonfruit makes its final preparations before going live, the directors are trying hard to shake off the ghost of Boo.com's unsuccessful launch, which haunts every start-up these days. To avoid staff becoming too launch-centric, management strategy is to encourage people to look ahead to what they will be doing in February or March. But no one knows for certain. It depends largely where the customers and the product leads them. \"When UK web users get hold of a start-up's product, an awful lot of information floods in. There is always a risk that a company like Moonfruit will rock a bit,\" explains Dickins. \"The Moonfruit team have no choice but to keep their heads, be disciplined and stick to the processes and procedures which are now in place.\" There are potentially enormous pots of treasure at the end of the cyber rainbow. But clearly there is no easy ticket to fame and fortune.",

Nintendo of America's marketing man, Peter Main, has responded by telling analysts about the company's commitment to the platform, and by giving details of two new machines: Dolphin, and Game Boy Advance. </p> <p>Main listed some forthcoming N64 games with US launch dates. These included Mario Party 2 (January 24), Ridge Racer 64 (February 14), Pok\u00e9mon Stadium (March 6), Perfect Dark (April 10), and Kirby 64 (June 12). Also on the way this year are Banjo-Tooie, Conker's Bad Fur Day, and Pikachu VRS. </p> <p>Main promised more details on the next-generation Dolphin console in the next two weeks: \"We're going to be very very competitive, and we think that both Dreamcast and PlayStation are going to have their hands full.\" </p> <p><strong> Advancing Game Boy</strong><br> What no one disputes is that Nintendo's Game Boy has been a huge success, thanks to the arrival of the colour screen version and Pok\u00e9mon games. Peter Main says that more than 100 new Game Boy games will appear this year, including Perfect Dark, Donkey Kong, and a new Pok\u00e9mon game, Pok\u00e9mon Attack. The next generation hardware, Game Boy Advance, could be launched in Japan in August, and Main said Nintendo of America had pencilled in November 1 for the US launch. GBA could also reach the UK before Christmas, but it is expected to cost at least \u00a390. </p> <p><strong> Christmas sales</strong><br> The UK market looks much like the US, according to Christmas sales figures published by trade magazine Computer Trade Weekly. CTW estimates that Sony shifted 506,000 PlayStations in December, compared with only 55,000 Nintendo 64s. However, the Game Boy handhelds racked up 331,000 sales in December and 900,000 over the full year. </p> <p><strong> Allegiance now open</strong><br> Microsoft has just released a public beta test version of its forthcoming multiplayer online space combat game, Allegiance, at <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/games/allegiance\">www.microsoft.com/games/allegiance</a>. The game includes 36 user- controllable spacecraft and a full 3D world. However, the download is roughly the size you'd expect - 55MB - which will be enough to deter casual gamers. The final release is expected in March. </p> <p><strong> Konami tops</strong><br> Konami was the leading Japanese games publisher last year, according to a top 10 listing published by gamezine <a href=\"http://www.fgnonline.com\">FGN</a> on January 11. Square, creator of the Final Fantasy series, also beat the big names - Sony, Nintendo, Sega - by the number of units sold. The top 10 was: Konami (9.7m games sold), Square (7.7m), Nintendo (7.4m), Sony (6.2m), Capcom (3.3m), Namco (2.9m), D3 Publisher (2.4m), Bandai (2.2m), Sega (2m) and Enix (1.7m). </p>",

Instead of leaving them to moulder, you can put your prize snaps on the web where friends and family will be able to look at them immediately, no matter where in the world they are. </p> <p>Putting pictures on the web also means not having to say you're sorry for forgetting to send people copies of prints. You simply tell them the internet address, and possibly a password, instead. </p> <p>There are already more than a dozen websites designed to make it easy to put your photographs on the internet. They can be divided into two types. The first is aimed at people with digital cameras, and the second at the traditional photographic market. Sites aimed at digital camera users typically offer to convert image files into high quality prints, whereas sites aimed at film camera users convert prints and negatives into image files. In other respects they tend to overlap. </p> <p>There's nothing new about putting digital images on the net. People have been using the free web space at home-builder sites like <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com\" target=\"_new\">GeoCities</a> for years. However, \"family album\" sites such as <a href=\"http://www.photopoint.com\" target=\"_new\">PhotoPoint</a>, <a href=\"http://www.photoloft.com\" target=\"_new\">PhotoLoft</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gatherround.com\" target=\"_new\">GatherRound</a> (owned and operated by Intel), Hewlett-Packard's <a href=\"http://www.cartogra.com\" target=\"_new\">Cartogra</a> and <a href=\"http://www.zing.com\" target=\"_new\">Zing</a> make it easy to put pictures online without the effort of creating web pages or, usually, uploading things the hard way using the file transfer protocol, FTP. </p> <p>PhotoPoint accepts pictures sent by electronic mail, for example, while <a href=\"http://www.shutterfly.com\" target=\"_new\">Shutterfly</a> offers \"drag-and-drop image uploading\". Photo Access has automated the process with its PhotoStreamer technology. \"Just plug your camera into your PC. It's automatically detected, the upload window pops up, and your pictures are extracted,\" it claims. </p> <p>You can then send the web address to friends and relations so that they can look at your pictures, usually by clicking on a link supplied. This is easier than emailing the same image to a dozen or more people, and avoids any problems in decoding and displaying the pictures. </p> <p>Once the pictures are online, the sites have the chance to make money. For a start, they can offer to make prints using large professional printers, which produce better results than cheap colour printers. And most don't stop at paper. For example, PhotoPoint will put your pictures on to greeting cards, photo cubes, puzzles, mouse mats, mugs, coasters, baseball caps, baby onesies and wall clocks, for a fee. </p> <p>PhotoLoft's chief executive officer, Jack Marshall, says: \"a photo personalised item... is never a commodity. It can't be. It contains a picture that is, by definition, of high value to the purchaser.\" </p> <p>But what about the hundreds of millions of people who don't have a digital camera, or a scanner that can convert prints into image files? Film and photographic processing companies have been targeting this market for more than a decade with offers to deliver prints both on paper and on floppy disk or CD-rom. Now they're offering to post them on the web as well. </p> <p>Kodak's <a href=\"http://www.photonet.com\" target=\"_new&quot;target=_new\">PhotoNet</a> service does this in the US. Kodak has also been working with America Online and more than 40,000 retailers to roll out a system called You've Got Pictures, instead of You've Got Mail. Cross the box marked AOL on the photo processing envelope and Kodak will email a set of pictures to your AOL account for an extra $5.95. Seattle FilmWorks runs a similar operation with AT&amp;T's internet service, <a href=\"http://www.worldnet.com\" target=\"_new\">WorldNet</a>, and it has already scanned more than 70 million images. Seattle FilmWorks also offers an innovative service called WeddingWorks, which combines pre-loaded cameras with pre-paid film, processing, and online archiving. </p> <p>Putting pictures online does involve making one decision that wasn't a problem during photography's first hundred years. Do you want to keep your pictures private, or will you let anyone anywhere in the world look at them? </p> <p>Some things must be public. Photo sites are often used to post pictures of things for sale in online auctions, for example, and could be used for missing persons . Others are just as obviously private. </p> <p>In fact, lots of people do make their pictures public, about 20%, according to PhotoPoint. Most online photo sites sort albums into categories and provide a Yahoo-like index to make them easier to access. PhotoPoint, for example, has sections for People (Reunions, Babies, Families), Attractions (Disney, Theme Parks, etc), For Sale &amp; eBay, and Destinations/Travel, among others. </p> <p>Most sites also allow visitors to add comments to a \"guest book\" attached to the photos, and these are often more interesting than the pictures themselves. Sad to say, the photographic quality of most online albums is dire. </p> <p>While online photo sites attract a few sad exhibitionists, they do not seem to have a problem with pornography. They do not have the time or the staff that would be needed to check all the things people put online, but they will look at anything that attracts an unusual amount of traffic, and remove it if they think it's unsuitable. </p> <p><strong> Photo sites</strong></p> <p> <strong> America Online</strong> <br> <a href=\"https://pictures.aol.com/\" target=\"_new\">https://pictures.aol.com</a><br> <strong> Club Photo </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.clubphoto.com/ \">www.clubphoto.com</a> <br> <strong>EZPrints</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.ezprints.com\">www.ezprints.com</a><br> <strong>FotoTime.com</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.fototime.com\">www.fototime.com</a><br> <strong> ForoWire Print Service </strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.fotowire.com\">www.fotowire.com</a> <br> <strong> GatherRound</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.gatherround.com\">www.gatherround.com</a> <br> <strong> Hewlett-Packard Cartogra </strong> <a href=\"http://www.cartogra.com\">www.cartogra.com</a> <br> <strong> Kodak PhotoNet</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.photonet.com\">www.photonet.com</a> <br> <strong> Photo Access</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.photoaccess.com\">www.photoaccess.com</a> <br> <strong> Photo Loft</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.photoloft.com\">www.photoloft.com</a> <br> <strong> PhotoPoint</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.photopoint.com\">www.photopoint.com </a> <br> <strong> Print Room</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.printroom.com\">www.printroom.com</a> <br> <strong> Seattle Filmworks </strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.filmworks.com\">www.filmworks.com</a> <br> <strong> Shutterfly (JC)</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.shutterfly.com\">www.shutterfly.com</a> <br> <strong> Webshots </strong> <a href=\"http://www.webshots.com\">www.webshots.com</a> <br> <strong> Zing</strong> <a href=\"http://www.zing.com \">www.zing.com</a><br> <strong> See also:</strong> <a href=\"http://dir.yahoo.com/ Business_and_Economy/ Companies/Internet _Services/ Web_Services/Photo_Albums\" target=\"_new\">http://dir.yahoo.com/ Business_and_Economy/ Companies/Internet _Services/ Web_Services/Photo_Albums</a></p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> No matter how spirited the press conference, or how high the combined worth of the resulting entity - upwards of $300bn - the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner is as desperate a measure for both partners as it is intelligent. </p> <p>Each company bailed the other out, and just in time. To be sure, celebrations are in order. A company that did not exist two decades ago, in an industry that did not exist two decades ago, has succeeded in absorbing the century's biggest and most influential media conglomerate. </p> <p> Despite widespread predictions to the contrary, America Online founder Steve Case proved that his subscription-only, dumbed-down, parallel universe to the internet could do more than almost any web company: it could be extremely profitable. Expanding on its philosophy that people will pay for good content, America Online now has unlimited and exclusive access to the film, television, and print properties of Time Warner. </p> <p> Time Warner, for its part, gets to keep its name and its pride for at least a while longer. The company's online ventures have failed miserably so far. Time Warner's first interactive television project died before it was launched. An umbrella website for Time's magazines, called Pathfinder, was finally terminated last year due to lack of interest. Then, Time Warner's long- promised online news and entertainment hubs never materialised. The company's best chance for place at the e-table was to merge and merge quickly. </p> <p>Rather than buying into the new media revolution when they had the chance, traditional media companies like Time Warner stood by and smirked while internet startups such as America Online went from being acquisition targets to merger prospects to acquirers themselves. But no matter how long they waited for the prices of these internet stocks to fall in line with their (mostly negative) earnings, the valuations of new media companies only went higher. </p> <p>Meanwhile, old media company's stock prices remained stagnant, as shareholders moved to the high-flying Nasdaq. One by one, the old media companies gave in, accepting engagements with young suitors at increasingly absurd exchange rates.

      "bodyText": "No matter how spirited the press conference, or how high the combined worth of the resulting entity - upwards of $300bn - the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner is as desperate a measure for both partners as it is intelligent. Each company bailed the other out, and just in time. To be sure, celebrations are in order. A company that did not exist two decades ago, in an industry that did not exist two decades ago, has succeeded in absorbing the century's biggest and most influential media conglomerate. Despite widespread predictions to the contrary, America Online founder Steve Case proved that his subscription-only, dumbed-down, parallel universe to the internet could do more than almost any web company: it could be extremely profitable. Expanding on its philosophy that people will pay for good content, America Online now has unlimited and exclusive access to the film, television, and print properties of Time Warner. Time Warner, for its part, gets to keep its name and its pride for at least a while longer. The company's online ventures have failed miserably so far. Time Warner's first interactive television project died before it was launched. An umbrella website for Time's magazines, called Pathfinder, was finally terminated last year due to lack of interest. Then, Time Warner's long- promised online news and entertainment hubs never materialised. The company's best chance for place at the e-table was to merge and merge quickly. Rather than buying into the new media revolution when they had the chance, traditional media companies like Time Warner stood by and smirked while internet startups such as America Online went from being acquisition targets to merger prospects to acquirers themselves. But no matter how long they waited for the prices of these internet stocks to fall in line with their (mostly negative) earnings, the valuations of new media companies only went higher. Meanwhile, old media company's stock prices remained stagnant, as shareholders moved to the high-flying Nasdaq. One by one, the old media companies gave in, accepting engagements with young suitors at increasingly absurd exchange rates. Afraid to be left alone, and sinking under the weight of its own longstanding debt, Time Warner finally cashed itself in for America Online's high-priced stock. (That'll teach Time magazine to make Jeff Bezos, billionaire founder of yet-to-turn-a-profit Amazon.com, its Person of the Year.) Because no matter how well camouflaged, and how much \"synergy\" is alluded to, this was not a marriage, but a purchase.

Case will be the chairman of the board, and America Online will own 55% of America Online-Time-Warner. The 70% premium he paid for Time Warner's shares was a way to preserve the integrity of the brand he was acquiring. But, ultimately, Time Warner wasn't purchased for anything as historically virtuous as its name or its content companies. It was bought for its wire. America Online, choking on its own success, has long suffered from inadequate bandwidth to service its tremendous subscriber base. Since telephone and cable companies began to offer high-speed access to the internet last year, America Online has once again been at a loss for how to secure its own fat pipeline for the future. Steve Case has been engaged in a long, losing, and embarrassing battle with AT&amp;T over the phone giant's reluctance to provide him and his customers with high speed connections.

It has been estimated that in Milan, the heartland of Craxi's political support, bribes worth \u00a360m changed hands annually during the boom years of his premiership: 50% went to the PSI, 20% to the Christian Democrats, 20% to the Communists and the rest to the minor government parties. The system, known as Tangentopoli (Bribesville), collapsed when a combination of increasing political greed and economic recession made the burden unbearable for the businessmen who were footing the bill.</p> <p>Craxi's spectacular style of politics was costly.

He chose as the bride the curvy model Laetitia Casta, recently crowned as the new Marianne, the highest accolade bestowed upon a beautiful woman in France. Tom Ford was not at the show.",

      "bodyText": "The failure this week of a US prototype missile interceptor to hit a mock warhead high above the Pacific ocean could delay Washington's decision on its controversial anti-ballistic missile system until after the presidential elections, defence analysts said yesterday. In a crucial test for the project - sometimes called the Son of Star Wars - the intercepting \"kill vehicle\", launched from Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall islands on Tuesday, failed to hit its target: a Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile fired into space from the Vandenberg air force base in California. The mock warhead was designed to simulate a missile attack against the US. Washington insists that a potential threat - notably from such \"rogue\" states as North Korea and Iran - must be met by a national protective shield. The project is strongly opposed by allies of the US, who say that it would erode Europe's security and unleash a new arms race. Speaking after the failed test, Lieutenant Colonel Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Pentagon's ballistic missile defence organisation, said: \"We did not have an intercept.\" Asked why, he said: \"We don't have any idea. We don't know what happened when it got into space.\" The Pentagon has drawn up a plan to deploy 100 interceptors based in Alaska by 2005 at a cost of nearly $13bn (\u00a38bn). President Bill Clinton had been expected to give the go-ahead to the project later this year and seek congressional approval for an initial $2.2bn for it. But even before Tuesday's failed test, Pentagon officials were warning that the system could be delayed by at least a year because of technical and political problems. A dummy warhead was destroyed in the first test three months ago, but critics claim that the missile might not have found the target without the unintended help of a decoy balloon. \"They don't know whether the results of the first test tell them whether they had a real success or a lucky shot,\" said Tom Collina of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental campaign group. \"This is a system that has grave implications for our relationships with Russia and China and our Nato allies, none of whom like this system.\" A final test is planned for April or May. The US is trying to persuade Moscow to amend the 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty to allow it to go ahead with the project. But despite Washington's insistence that the project is directed at \"rogue\" states - and not Russia, whose large nuclear arsenal would in any case penetrate the system - Moscow says it is opposed to any change in the ABM treaty. China, which has a much smaller nuclear arsenal than Russia, is also strongly opposed to the project, saying it could threaten its security. All the Republican presidential candidates want to press ahead with the national missile defence project, though the Democrat hopefuls - the vice-president, Al Gore, and the former senator Bill Bradley - are more wary. Terry Taylor, the assistant director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an independent research organisation, said yesterday that it could be politically convenient for Mr Clinton to delay a making a decision on the project. \"Unless there is an amazing success in the meantime, it might be delayed until a new president,\" he said. But he said the Europeans could not ignore pressure from the US for the project. Washington has been privately pressing its European allies to draw up their own plans for an anti-ballistic missile system - a prospect they do not want to face, partly because of the potential costs involved in such a project.",

The recovery of the bodies of the men, who were naked and had their hands and feet tied, came after a dramatic shootout in the city on Monday, in which the leader of the hard line Turkish Hizbullah faction, Huseyin Velioglu, was killed by police. After interrogating two senior members of the group who were captured during the exchange of fire, the police cordoned off streets in the early hours of yesterday morning around a run-down house in Uskudar, on the Asian side of Istanbul. Forensic experts picked their way through the house and garden to make a series of grim discoveries. The businessmen, who were all thought to have had Islamist sympathies, had disappeared over the course of the past few weeks. Local media reports say their bank accounts had been emptied before they were killed. It was the fraudulent use of a credit card which led to a breakthrough in the case. The death of Velioglu, who exchanged fire with police marksmen for several hours, is being seen as a big setback to Turkish Hizbullah. \"The organisation has suffered a great blow,\" said Suleyman Ikizer, the head of the police anti-terror department in Istanbul.

It quickly won supporters among rural religious Kurds in the south-east of the country and there have been persistent suggestions that it was initially sponsored by elements within the state in the battle against Abdullah Ocalan's secular Kurdish rebel group, the PKK. But as the military threat from the PKK has decreased, so the level of concern about Hizbullah's activities has risen. There have been hundreds of arrests of alleged Hizbullah sympathisers in the south-east in the past couple of years. The Turkish prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, yesterday hailed the success of the security forces and pledged to continue the campaign against Islamic extremism. \"I believe we will be able to eradicate the Hizbullah in a short time,\" he told a meeting of his parliamentary group, \"just as we have started to eradicate the PKK in Turkey and the world.\" The Turkish military has described Islamic radical groups such as Hizbullah as the biggest security challenge facing the country.

      "body": "<p>On Tuesday at the editorial offices of Reuters in New York about 90 editorial staff threw an \"organised sick-out,\" protesting at the snail's pace of contract negotiations between the company and their union, the New York Newspaper Guild. </p> <p>The matter was swept aside as a little local difficulty and a team of non-unionised staff and editorial managers continued to pump out the news during the dispute. The product did not suffer. </p> <p>Back in London, it is tempting to speculate that Peter Job, who has now notched up a decade in the chief executive's seat at Reuters, probably fancies throwing a quick sickie of his own. </p> <p>Hardly a day goes by without a story appearing somewhere about how this information organisation is struggling to get a handle on how it should adapt to the internet age. Stories on spin-offs - whether the portfolio of start-up investments or the Instinet equity broking division - are re-cooked and re-syndicated, and all the while there is an unending stream of rumours about staff defections, low morale and the like. </p> <p>All this has been fuelled by \"real\" events, such as this week's sudden and unexplained departure of information division chief John Parcell, who is leaving Reuters after 30 years with the firm. He was the internal favourite to take over when Mr Job retires, scheduled for summer next year. A news organisation should know that the suppression of facts simply cranks up a story, and the upshot now in the City is that when analysts are asked to put a price on Reuters stock, they routinely talk in terms of break-up values. </p> <p>Yet this picture of corporate uncertainty fuelling internal crisis is not quite reflected in the performance of the share price. Mr Job himself stepped into the market back in October, spending \u00a350,000 of his own money on shares then priced at 465p apiece. Three months on, he has doubled his money. </p> <p>Some of this performance can be put down to takeover speculation, and we have already had the predictable snap on Reuters setting up a \"bid defence committee\" - which must be just about obligatory for all Footsie companies in the current climate. </p> <p>There is a belief in certain high offices at 85 Fleet Street that some of the recent editorial coverage of its affairs is perhaps slightly tainted (paranoia is just another symptom of the smudging of lines of competition). </p> <p>But it is fair to say that in recent coverage of this company's affairs there have been precious few attempts to explain just how powerful Reuters is when it comes to collecting and disseminating news and financial data. As a brand it carries an aura of \"trust\" which is unmatched by any of its competitors. In any newsroom, if Reuters spells a name one way and, say, Bloomberg another, the former will be printed. This is one piece of \"old media\" which is being substantially undervalued. </p> <p><strong> Twisted tips </strong><br> </p> <p> It's a tricky business, tipping stocks. And in current market conditions, following the wrong tipster can prove very painful for investors - as quite a few readers of the Daily Mirror discovered yesterday. </p> <p>On Tuesday, the newspaper's City Slickers column, aimed at Britain's growing hordes of amateur punters, brought us news that Alan Sugar's Viglen Technology was getting its internet act together and the shares subsequently doubled in price as the story proved correct. </p> <p>So, yesterday's Mirror brought its readers another couple of business exclusives: Dixons boss Sir Stanley Kalms was reported to be lining up a bid for Electronics Boutiques, a little chain of computer games shops, while David Lloyd's MV Sport had apparently \"won the contract to design, construct and have total control of\" a new website for the current school playground cult game Pokemon. A Dixons spokesman had to be wheeled out to deny the Electronics Boutique story, while MV Sports chose to issue a formal statement.

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday at the editorial offices of Reuters in New York about 90 editorial staff threw an \"organised sick-out,\" protesting at the snail's pace of contract negotiations between the company and their union, the New York Newspaper Guild. The matter was swept aside as a little local difficulty and a team of non-unionised staff and editorial managers continued to pump out the news during the dispute. The product did not suffer. Back in London, it is tempting to speculate that Peter Job, who has now notched up a decade in the chief executive's seat at Reuters, probably fancies throwing a quick sickie of his own. Hardly a day goes by without a story appearing somewhere about how this information organisation is struggling to get a handle on how it should adapt to the internet age. Stories on spin-offs - whether the portfolio of start-up investments or the Instinet equity broking division - are re-cooked and re-syndicated, and all the while there is an unending stream of rumours about staff defections, low morale and the like. All this has been fuelled by \"real\" events, such as this week's sudden and unexplained departure of information division chief John Parcell, who is leaving Reuters after 30 years with the firm. He was the internal favourite to take over when Mr Job retires, scheduled for summer next year. A news organisation should know that the suppression of facts simply cranks up a story, and the upshot now in the City is that when analysts are asked to put a price on Reuters stock, they routinely talk in terms of break-up values. Yet this picture of corporate uncertainty fuelling internal crisis is not quite reflected in the performance of the share price. Mr Job himself stepped into the market back in October, spending \u00a350,000 of his own money on shares then priced at 465p apiece. Three months on, he has doubled his money. Some of this performance can be put down to takeover speculation, and we have already had the predictable snap on Reuters setting up a \"bid defence committee\" - which must be just about obligatory for all Footsie companies in the current climate. There is a belief in certain high offices at 85 Fleet Street that some of the recent editorial coverage of its affairs is perhaps slightly tainted (paranoia is just another symptom of the smudging of lines of competition). But it is fair to say that in recent coverage of this company's affairs there have been precious few attempts to explain just how powerful Reuters is when it comes to collecting and disseminating news and financial data. As a brand it carries an aura of \"trust\" which is unmatched by any of its competitors. In any newsroom, if Reuters spells a name one way and, say, Bloomberg another, the former will be printed. This is one piece of \"old media\" which is being substantially undervalued. Twisted tips It's a tricky business, tipping stocks. And in current market conditions, following the wrong tipster can prove very painful for investors - as quite a few readers of the Daily Mirror discovered yesterday. On Tuesday, the newspaper's City Slickers column, aimed at Britain's growing hordes of amateur punters, brought us news that Alan Sugar's Viglen Technology was getting its internet act together and the shares subsequently doubled in price as the story proved correct. So, yesterday's Mirror brought its readers another couple of business exclusives: Dixons boss Sir Stanley Kalms was reported to be lining up a bid for Electronics Boutiques, a little chain of computer games shops, while David Lloyd's MV Sport had apparently \"won the contract to design, construct and have total control of\" a new website for the current school playground cult game Pokemon. A Dixons spokesman had to be wheeled out to deny the Electronics Boutique story, while MV Sports chose to issue a formal statement. Never mind that there are thousands of Pokemon sites on the web, MV has not got a contract to design and build a new one. All that has happened is that it has applied for one of the licenses to make Pokemon branded products. These might be shrugged off as a couple of loose shots - except that real people are getting hit. With so many inexperienced investors now following such wayward stock market tips, a huge transfer of wealth is under way - from the public to a small group of City professionals who have traditionally controlled trading in small and illiquid shares. It is worth noting the Mirror first tipped Electronics Boutique when shares were close to 100p. Yesterday, the price spiked to 37p in the morning before falling back to 32p. MV Sports is a so-called \"penny stock,\" quoted at 3p and of interest only to hardened market gamblers. As for Viglen, the \u00a3125m Mr Sugar (a Mirror columnist) made on Tuesday as the shares surged had shrunk by \u00a310m by the close yesterday.",

      "body": "<p>Dear chairman,</p> <p>I am writing this letter to give you and the other Wednesday shareholders a clearer picture of what the four Sheffield MPs discussed with Charterhouse Bank last Thursday, and the questions we raised. </p> <p>The meeting lasted one hour. Our discussion about the performance of the team and whether the manager could keep it in the Premier League lasted one minute, which received enormous media coverage. Consequently the other major issues of this meeting have still to be aired. </p> <p>We put it to the bank that there was serious concern as to where the debts of \u00a316/18 million (which the club have never denied) had come from. </p> <p>Less than three years ago the bank put \u00a315million into Sheffield Wednesday. Since then the club has received another \u00a350million or so in turnover. So how has this huge debt occurred? </p> <p>You will remember that in 1995 the board decided to spend \u00a38million on building 20 new hospitality boxes for sponsors' lunches etc, three large restaurants, together with new catering facilities for the Euro Championships. </p> <p>Those of us on the board who had doubts were assured that the scheme would be totally self-financing with the income from the box sponsors producing the cash to repay a long-term mortgage loan, and that no money whatsoever would be taken from the team resources or from the other parts of the stadium. </p> <p>Now it would appear that this business plan debt has been lumped together with the other debts for transfer fees and wages, and the interest is in fact being paid by fans on the Kop and from the cash available for the team. </p> <p>Charterhouse admitted to us that if the club were to be sold then all the debts would be lumped together. These debts would of course be a serious deterrent to any prospective purchaser. </p> <p>It might then be thought that if Sheffield Wednesday were to be downsized from a business with a \u00a323million turnover with \u00a318million debts in the Premier League to a First Division club of \u00a39million with no debts it would be much easier to sell the club and regain some of the investment. </p> <p>It therefore seems to the MPs that if this is the business plan of the board the shareholders and the fans are entitled to know. We would remind you personally and the other plc directors that you do not own the club. </p> <p>The directors of Wednesday own less than 10% of it and as such are simply elected trustees. If this business plan is being adopted then it is in the public interest for MPs to ask questions. </p> <p>The clear impression we gained from the bank was that it now anticipates relegation and naturally regard it as their duty to protect their assets. </p> <p>Can I now raise the matter of your own personal position. Last May at Nottingham Forest when you told me you were going to run for the position of chairman of the Premier League and deputy chairman of the FA I reminded you of the old political advice that it is not possible to ride two horses with one arse in a three-ring circus. </p> <p>Nevertheless, you are now chairman of the Premier League and sitting on the top committees of the FA which demands a great deal of time and a large part of the week in London, which in my opinion means that Sheffield Wednesday duties cannot have your undivided attention. </p> <p>Can you now tell the shareholders whether it is your intention to apply for a top paid job as the full-time neutral chairman of the Premier League in April? And where would that leave Sheffield Wednesday? What is the point of you spending weeks this spring negotiating massive BSkyB deals for the Premier League when we may not be in it? </p> <p>You will also remember that after the team's dismal display against Bristol City in the (FA) Cup on December 11, you specifically told me you wanted to stand down from the chairman's job. </p> <p>You will also remember the heated discussion we had at Stamford Bridge on December 29, where you said the club debt was only \u00a36.5million. </p> <p>Quite frankly Mr Richards, this is not the way to run Sheffield Wednesday, and I am not surprised that our beloved team is stranded at the foot of the table. </p> <p>Therefore I suggest to you that you should now answer these very relevant questions which the MPs put to the bank and seriously consider your position as chairman of the club. </p> <p>Yours sincerely</p> <p>Joe Ashton MP </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,124711,00.html\">Ashton turns ire on the chairman</a></p>",

Last May at Nottingham Forest when you told me you were going to run for the position of chairman of the Premier League and deputy chairman of the FA I reminded you of the old political advice that it is not possible to ride two horses with one arse in a three-ring circus. Nevertheless, you are now chairman of the Premier League and sitting on the top committees of the FA which demands a great deal of time and a large part of the week in London, which in my opinion means that Sheffield Wednesday duties cannot have your undivided attention. Can you now tell the shareholders whether it is your intention to apply for a top paid job as the full-time neutral chairman of the Premier League in April? And where would that leave Sheffield Wednesday? What is the point of you spending weeks this spring negotiating massive BSkyB deals for the Premier League when we may not be in it? You will also remember that after the team's dismal display against Bristol City in the (FA) Cup on December 11, you specifically told me you wanted to stand down from the chairman's job. You will also remember the heated discussion we had at Stamford Bridge on December 29, where you said the club debt was only \u00a36.5million. Quite frankly Mr Richards, this is not the way to run Sheffield Wednesday, and I am not surprised that our beloved team is stranded at the foot of the table. Therefore I suggest to you that you should now answer these very relevant questions which the MPs put to the bank and seriously consider your position as chairman of the club. Yours sincerely Joe Ashton MP Ashton turns ire on the chairman",

      "bodyText": "The takeover panel waded into the NatWest bid battle last night, reprimanding advisers to Bank of Scotland for dirty tactics. The takeover watchdog called on CSFB, BoS's financial advisers, to clarify its claims that just two out of some 60 big NatWest shareholders wanted the bank to remain independent. Sir David Rowland, NatWest's chairman, insisted there was little to choose from between the bids by BoS and Royal Bank of Scotland: \"Shareholders can roll the dice with either offer or benefit from the outstanding value and lower risk in a standalone NatWest.\" BoS claims - which it later satisfied the takeover panel were legitimate and based on early soundings of investors - were made as the Edinburgh-based bank revealed it had sent 100 spies to 144 of its prey's branches, which it concluded need \"major surgery\". BoS said it would open 125 new branches in areas where NatWest has gaps - the north east of England, the east coast and south Midlands - close 36 others, modernise 881 from the current \"bandit screen\" environment, modernise and relocate 523 and leave only 274 unchanged. The alleged lack of support for NatWest independence coincided with mounting concerns that the job reduction programme initiated by NatWest in its defence against the bids were being conducted too hastily. \"NatWest may have damaged its revenue growth prospects by key staff cuts in recent weeks,\" said Martin Cross, banking analyst at Teather &amp; Greenwood, one of the few brokers still to offer \"independent\" comment on the bid.

In the first, superior half the focus is on the distrait Hamletesque figure of Don Carlos, who suffers a fatal passion for his stepmother and a furious relationship with his brutal father, Philip II. But, in the intrigue-packed second half, Schiller clearly becomes more fascinated by Philip's isolation and by the complex idealism of the Marquis of Posa, who yearns to free the Netherlands from the Spanish yoke. Posa sacrifices himself to save Don Carlos and the Low Countries; but, theatrically, Schiller sacrifices his titular hero to an exploration of the dynamics of power. </p> <p>If this makes the play somewhat unwieldy, it also throws up a disturbingly ambivalent figure in the character of Posa. What Ray Fearon, in rimless specs and well-cut suit, brings out very well is the fanaticism lurking under Posa's idealism. In his protestations about freedom to Philip II, he is a passionate libertarian. But his manipulation of Carlos, by having him arrested and showing his letters to the king, suggests that he enjoys playing God. The parallel that Fearon brings to mind is the Duke in Measure for Measure, another figure who, in the name of justice, treats people like puppets. </p> <p>Even if the play becomes over-labyrinthine, it yields tremendous scenes and fine gestural acting from a first-rate cast. John Woodvine has done nothing better than his Philip - a testy despot, flinching at his son's touch, but also one racked by guilt, insomnia and fears of his wife's adultery. As the character disintegrates, so Woodvine's performance grows ever stronger. Seizing on the endless Shakespearean references in Robert David MacDonald's sparky translation, Rupert Penry-Jones turns Don Carlos into a capricious Spanish Hamlet clearly more concerned by the expression of his passion for Josette Simon's fiery Elizabeth of Valois than the oppression of Flanders and Brabant. And by a nice irony the grand inquisitor, who finally appears to show where the real power lies, is played by John Rogan not as a majestic prelate but as someone small, wiry and sightless. </p> <p>Each to his taste; but if you have an appetite for romantic tragedy, where private passions intersect with public politics, then Gale Edwards's beautifully designed and lit production is the real, right thing. In short, theatre at its most theatrical. </p>",
