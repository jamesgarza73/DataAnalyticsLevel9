      "body": "<p>Ageism is one of the least explored facets of working life. We all know it is harder to get a job when you are older, but we do not really know why. Few employers will publicly admit to ageism, so The Observer asked a range of people involved in recruitment about their attitudes to older people. </p> <p>'Young PR girls are enormously enthusiastic and will go running around like loonies to put in the extra mile,' says David, 50, a public relations consultant. 'Older employees don't seem to put themselves out as much. Occasionally I go to an educational function in the evening, and it is very noticeable that most of the audience is very young. It's probably a family thing. We want to get back to our families, but the young girls will combine work and social lives, and go out for a drink later.' </p> <p>Anna, a 26-year-old PR consultant, is a good example of this attitude. She works in a company staffed mainly by women of her own age. She has friends who are becoming managing directors in other consultancies by the age of 30. But when they are older they might fall out of the labour market for a while: 'Most of us don't see ourselves as being in a nine-to-five job for the rest of our lives. There are so many options, such as travelling abroad.' </p> <p>Frank Eve, 51, product strategy director of internet mortgage company E-loan, has a different, and more worrying, take on the difference between older and younger employees: 'The older you are, the more difficult it is to accept and adapt to change.' </p> <p>Perhaps this is true. Learning has always been associated with youth - learning to drive, learning a new language. Although many older people surf the web, people who buy financial services through the internet are most likely to be in their thirties. </p> <p>When Eve got his first job, his father congratulated him on the excellent pension scheme he was joining - which shows how different priorities were for that generation. Today, Eve is the oldest of the 50-strong team at E-loan, but he insists the company is not ageist: 'It is very important for a dotcom that people fit culturally. This is not an ageist thing, but a state of mind.' </p> <p>Very few older people applied for work at its Redhill offices - perhaps selecting themselves out of a hi-tech business. Eve and his fellow directors set no age requirements, but do want people who adapt to change. Eve believes the proportion of older people in the workplace is set to grow: 'People coming through now will be more flexible in their approach to employment - more motivated by opportunity than by security.' </p> <p>Michael, a company director, has just taken on a secretary nearly 15 years older than himself. Although he is clearly not ageist - insisting that he looks for people who want to continue learning, regardless of their age - he still notices age issues. 'I don't like it when people send in CVs without their ages on them. I do notice. I think that maybe they are embarrassed by their age.' </p> <p>In an interview, he may be more worried by an older person who is still hopping from job to job every two years; a twentysomething doing the same may just have yet to put down roots. 'We might delve more deeply into their motivation. Most employers still want people who will stay at least two years. In an interview, older applicants have to present themselves as flexible and willing to learn.' </p> <p>Losing touch with new developments can happen at all levels. One healthcare specialist bemoans the way surgeons over 50 are more likely to lag behind younger colleagues in their handling of new technology. A report in the Government's Labour Market Trends magazine in July 1998 highlighted a watershed: 'The age of 50 appears to be a turning point after which people find it more difficult to return to the labour force if they become unemployed or leave work for other reasons.' </p> <p>They are more likely to suffer poor health: 17 per cent of men aged 45 to 49 suffer from long-term health problems, says the same report, compared with 27 per cent of men aged 60 to 64. The over-fifties are more likely to see redundancy as a way of taking early retirement. They put less effort into finding another job, and use 'fewer methods of job search'. </p> <p>The incidence of ageism varies hugely from sector to sector, and between the employed and self-employed. The notoriously ageist IT industry will often pay 'a huge amount of money' to older self-employed consultants whom they would never consider putting on the payroll, says Louise Smith of JM recruitment consultants. </p> <p>Ageism is 'rife' in banking, says Richard Lynch of the finance union Unifi. Between 5 and 6 per cent of bank workers are over 50, he says. Philip Marks, director of financial markets at Jonathan Wren recruitment consultants, says it is very hard for older people to get staff jobs: 'We're always told that older people can't handle the technology and can't keep up with the hours. Employers often say they are investing in training and want someone with a long-term career.' </p> <p>Strangely, the high street banks were all founders of the Employers' Forum on Age, and they all say they want a workforce with a wide span of ages. But by getting rid of older workers in redundancy programmes, they saved a lot of money. In this hierarchical world, older workers had built up plenty of long-service increments and were more expensive to employ. The pension costs of older workers are much higher in the traditional 'final salary' schemes that banks used to run. </p> <p>A cynic might say the banks joined the forum to head off legislation on ageism by suggesting that they were solving the problem internally. If this was their plan, it worked. The Labour Party, once committed to outlawing ageism, introduced a voluntary code of practice when it came to power. This was 'a damp squib' in terms of effectiveness, says employment solicitor James Davies of Lewis Silkin. While there are Government commissions to fight racism, sexism and discrimination against the disabled, there is no such body to tackle age prejudice. </p> <p>Whatever happens, ageism will not go altogether. 'Middle-aged men do like to have young good-looking girls around,' says David the PR.

      "bodyText": "Ageism is one of the least explored facets of working life. We all know it is harder to get a job when you are older, but we do not really know why. Few employers will publicly admit to ageism, so The Observer asked a range of people involved in recruitment about their attitudes to older people. 'Young PR girls are enormously enthusiastic and will go running around like loonies to put in the extra mile,' says David, 50, a public relations consultant. 'Older employees don't seem to put themselves out as much. Occasionally I go to an educational function in the evening, and it is very noticeable that most of the audience is very young. It's probably a family thing. We want to get back to our families, but the young girls will combine work and social lives, and go out for a drink later.' Anna, a 26-year-old PR consultant, is a good example of this attitude. She works in a company staffed mainly by women of her own age. She has friends who are becoming managing directors in other consultancies by the age of 30. But when they are older they might fall out of the labour market for a while: 'Most of us don't see ourselves as being in a nine-to-five job for the rest of our lives. There are so many options, such as travelling abroad.' Frank Eve, 51, product strategy director of internet mortgage company E-loan, has a different, and more worrying, take on the difference between older and younger employees: 'The older you are, the more difficult it is to accept and adapt to change.' Perhaps this is true. Learning has always been associated with youth - learning to drive, learning a new language. Although many older people surf the web, people who buy financial services through the internet are most likely to be in their thirties. When Eve got his first job, his father congratulated him on the excellent pension scheme he was joining - which shows how different priorities were for that generation. Today, Eve is the oldest of the 50-strong team at E-loan, but he insists the company is not ageist: 'It is very important for a dotcom that people fit culturally. This is not an ageist thing, but a state of mind.' Very few older people applied for work at its Redhill offices - perhaps selecting themselves out of a hi-tech business. Eve and his fellow directors set no age requirements, but do want people who adapt to change. Eve believes the proportion of older people in the workplace is set to grow: 'People coming through now will be more flexible in their approach to employment - more motivated by opportunity than by security.' Michael, a company director, has just taken on a secretary nearly 15 years older than himself. Although he is clearly not ageist - insisting that he looks for people who want to continue learning, regardless of their age - he still notices age issues. 'I don't like it when people send in CVs without their ages on them. I do notice. I think that maybe they are embarrassed by their age.' In an interview, he may be more worried by an older person who is still hopping from job to job every two years; a twentysomething doing the same may just have yet to put down roots. 'We might delve more deeply into their motivation. Most employers still want people who will stay at least two years. In an interview, older applicants have to present themselves as flexible and willing to learn.' Losing touch with new developments can happen at all levels. One healthcare specialist bemoans the way surgeons over 50 are more likely to lag behind younger colleagues in their handling of new technology. A report in the Government's Labour Market Trends magazine in July 1998 highlighted a watershed: 'The age of 50 appears to be a turning point after which people find it more difficult to return to the labour force if they become unemployed or leave work for other reasons.' They are more likely to suffer poor health: 17 per cent of men aged 45 to 49 suffer from long-term health problems, says the same report, compared with 27 per cent of men aged 60 to 64. The over-fifties are more likely to see redundancy as a way of taking early retirement. They put less effort into finding another job, and use 'fewer methods of job search'. The incidence of ageism varies hugely from sector to sector, and between the employed and self-employed. The notoriously ageist IT industry will often pay 'a huge amount of money' to older self-employed consultants whom they would never consider putting on the payroll, says Louise Smith of JM recruitment consultants. Ageism is 'rife' in banking, says Richard Lynch of the finance union Unifi. Between 5 and 6 per cent of bank workers are over 50, he says. Philip Marks, director of financial markets at Jonathan Wren recruitment consultants, says it is very hard for older people to get staff jobs: 'We're always told that older people can't handle the technology and can't keep up with the hours. Employers often say they are investing in training and want someone with a long-term career.' Strangely, the high street banks were all founders of the Employers' Forum on Age, and they all say they want a workforce with a wide span of ages. But by getting rid of older workers in redundancy programmes, they saved a lot of money. In this hierarchical world, older workers had built up plenty of long-service increments and were more expensive to employ. The pension costs of older workers are much higher in the traditional 'final salary' schemes that banks used to run. A cynic might say the banks joined the forum to head off legislation on ageism by suggesting that they were solving the problem internally. If this was their plan, it worked. The Labour Party, once committed to outlawing ageism, introduced a voluntary code of practice when it came to power. This was 'a damp squib' in terms of effectiveness, says employment solicitor James Davies of Lewis Silkin. While there are Government commissions to fight racism, sexism and discrimination against the disabled, there is no such body to tackle age prejudice. Whatever happens, ageism will not go altogether. 'Middle-aged men do like to have young good-looking girls around,' says David the PR. 'I don't say this factor has clinched any \u00a3100,000 deals, but it may work subconsciously.' 'George', a politician nearing 50, laughs at the suggestion that he would employ a researcher of about his own age: 'Politicians are quite insecure. It suits them to have younger people who they can dominate. It would be an unusually self-confident politician who would employ a researcher of the same age - someone who could contradict them.'",

'It's the most important measurement.' In this case the verdict was damning: to the consumer the value of a Rover 75 is \u00a315,000 or \u00a316,000, irrespective of the fact that there is \u00a329,000-worth of engineering inside it. </p> <p>VW faces a similar situation with Skoda. These days, all cars have to be functional and reliable. Fundamentally, VW, Audi and Skoda, like Rover and BMW, are pretty similar under the skin.

'The battle isn't about the cars or their intrinsic quality - it's about what goes on between people's ears,' insists Bain. In Rover, 'BMW thought it was buying a strong brand - but it badly underestimated the extent to which it had lost the trust of the British public,' he says.

Admitting that a UK-owned company is simply not able to produce volume cars as well and cheaply as other firms would be hard politically and a bitter pill for the West Midlands. But some observers believe a dose of realism could liberate the wounded Rover brand from this obsession.

The trick is to learn how to say no, but nicely.' \u0095 'I am at the end of my tether ... I have no life. We are like zombies ' Daniel Davids, 30, deputy manager in the retail sector: 'I have become so ill that I am leaving because they will not allow me any time out. I used to work 70-hour weeks in my last job and I loved it. I thought I could handle anything. The problem is when the company demands more and more from you and makes you feel as if you are not capable when you cannot deliver. I am at the end of my tether. 'You get to the point when you start believing that you are no good ... you just work longer and end up achieving less. 'I get up at 5am every day to get in to work by 8am. I don't eat a proper breakfast and I rarely eat a decent lunch. I get home at 9pm and all I'm fit for is a shower. I eat a bowl of cereal or soup. I have no life. We are like zombies at the weekend. 'The worst thing is, you start thinking the abnormal is normal.' \u0095 'We have no time to think. It's sheer volume of work that creates the pressure' Sarah Cook, 55, senior manager for a health trust: 'I love my job but the pressure has got worse and worse because we have been forced into organisational change so often. We are going to be dissolved as a body in March so I am trying to manage that process as well as maintaining the day-to-day running. 'My day starts at 5.30am and I get to work at 8am. After I've done the emails the days are pretty much back-to-back meetings which somehow I have to combine with being a visible manager, walking around and being approachable. There are demands from above and from below. People are frightened they will lose their jobs. 'We have no time to think or plan. It is the sheer volume of work that creates the pressure. I manage my stress by going to the gym, but the number of bottles of red wine I get through has gone up dramatically. All my colleagues say the same.'",

It was doing well, but decided two years ago to seek business nationally. </p> <p>'The internet opens new doors for us,' says spokesman David House. 'From a standing start about 18 months ago, 30 per cent of our business is now generated outside the local area. We can demonstrate the benefits of mutuality. Something very important to us is good service. You have to be able to manage the service.

The culture tends to be much more customer-focused.' </p> <p>Few of London &amp; Country's clients are put off from taking a loan with a small society. Building societies are well-regulated and, after all, they are lending you the money rather than you depositing yours with them. E-loan believes the smaller societies can be extremely innovative. A small but dynamic society lending just \u00a320m a year can easily monitor its new deals, make any changes needed and launch a loan aimed at only 100 homebuyers. Big lenders are far less nimble. </p> <p>Many small societies realise what the internet can do for them. The Cheshire - highlighted by London &amp; Country for its five-year fix, pegged at 6.45 per cent - plans to allow online mortgage applications within a couple of months. 'The internet is making it easy for customers to do business with us,' says director Frank Harrington.

      "body": "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/gilbert-and-george-portrait-artists-young-men\">View the work online</a></p> <p><strong> Artists: </strong> Gilbert Proesch (born Italy, 1943) and George Passmore (born Devon, 1942), who met as students at St Martin\u2019s College of Art in 1967, formed themselves into the entity Gilbert and George, set up an office in Fournier Street, Spitalfields, east London, offering their services as \u201cliving sculptures\u201d making \u201cArt For All\u201d, and have carried on making art together, being art together, still living in Fournier Street and, in their recent photoworks, appearing naked in oceans of blood and urine. </p> <p><strong> Distinguishing features:</strong> This is a very funny work of art. The title suggests all the bursting passions associated with youth: anger, energy, ambition, libido. But we don\u2019t get any of that. Instead, this black-and-white video, which runs on a continuous loop, gives us a study in stasis. It begins with a title card bearing their royal-looking crest, as if this was the start of an old Gainsborough Studios film. The \u201caction\u201d begins. Gilbert and George pose, weakly and lifelessly. They just stand there, in bespoke suits and tight collars, moving ever so slightly, their faces impassive, their hair flattened. George feebly smokes a cigarette. </p> <p>Of all Gilbert and George\u2019s works, this is the one that most acutely raises the question of whether their works are \u201cportraits\u201d, in the sense of representations of a person that tell us who they are and what they are like. Does this artwork contain any personal information, or is the washed-out, superlit image a mask concealing nothing? </p> <p>Gilbert and George have become celebrities on such a scale that it is sometimes hard to see their work at all. They are jokers, storytellers and the patron saints of contemporary British art. Like Andy Warhol before them, Gilbert and George present a flat, unemphatic image to the world and somehow, because of this emptiness, they become charged with meanings from the wider culture. Their art is porous to social history. Indeed, the best way to understand this artwork may be in relation to pop music. </p> <p>The year in which this video was made, 1972, was the peak of Glam in pop culture and this is a Glam work of art. The ultra-stylised poses of Gilbert and George are those of self-con scious decadents, infinitely refined aesthetes, just like the image created by Roxy Music or David Bowie. Even the deeply shadowed, whited-out look of this video, which according to the artists\u2019 instructions must be shown with the contrast unnaturally high, is the same blank aesthetic we see in the portrait of Lou Reed on the cover of his 1972 album Transformer. </p> <p>The title of this work seems to be a joke. James Joyce\u2019s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a study of the development of an artist, of the experiences that make a sensibility. Gilbert and George on the other hand deny they ever \u201cdeveloped\u201d at all. They simply became Gilbert and George one day in a convulsive change, instant and absolute. \u201cWe have never seen a young artist\u201d, they said in an early manifesto. </p> <p>A Portrait of The Artists as Young Men is about masquerade, play-acting, about becoming something other that what you were told you were. Gilbert and George assert the right not just to reinvent themselves but to resemble an alien life form. They are not hiding behind masks but assert that they are the mask, the \u201csculpture\u201d. To be an artist for them is to be a kind of monster, a new species in the world. Like their contemporaries in pop, they liberate themselves by erasing the usual marks of human identity. </p> <p> <strong>Inspirations and influences:</strong> This could be seen as a parody of the very minimalist, very serious, artists\u2019 film of the 60s, exemplified by Michael Snow\u2019s Wavelength (1967), in which the camera zooms in slowly on a patch of wall. Gilbert and George take the deliberate tedium of minimalist film and make it a joke. In this they have a lot in common with conceptual artists such as John Baldessari and William Wegman, who used badly made video art to mock art\u2019s claim to seriousness. </p> <p>Today, young artists are returning to this cruder, funnier age of video. An artist whose works resemble this piece is Hilary Lloyd, who makes video portraits of apparently passive, vacuous young people. </p> <p><strong> Where is it?</strong> Tate Modern, Bankside, London SE1 (020-7887 8000). </p>",

      "bodyText": "\u00b7 View the work online Artists: Gilbert Proesch (born Italy, 1943) and George Passmore (born Devon, 1942), who met as students at St Martin\u2019s College of Art in 1967, formed themselves into the entity Gilbert and George, set up an office in Fournier Street, Spitalfields, east London, offering their services as \u201cliving sculptures\u201d making \u201cArt For All\u201d, and have carried on making art together, being art together, still living in Fournier Street and, in their recent photoworks, appearing naked in oceans of blood and urine. Distinguishing features: This is a very funny work of art. The title suggests all the bursting passions associated with youth: anger, energy, ambition, libido. But we don\u2019t get any of that. Instead, this black-and-white video, which runs on a continuous loop, gives us a study in stasis. It begins with a title card bearing their royal-looking crest, as if this was the start of an old Gainsborough Studios film. The \u201caction\u201d begins. Gilbert and George pose, weakly and lifelessly. They just stand there, in bespoke suits and tight collars, moving ever so slightly, their faces impassive, their hair flattened. George feebly smokes a cigarette. Of all Gilbert and George\u2019s works, this is the one that most acutely raises the question of whether their works are \u201cportraits\u201d, in the sense of representations of a person that tell us who they are and what they are like. Does this artwork contain any personal information, or is the washed-out, superlit image a mask concealing nothing? Gilbert and George have become celebrities on such a scale that it is sometimes hard to see their work at all. They are jokers, storytellers and the patron saints of contemporary British art. Like Andy Warhol before them, Gilbert and George present a flat, unemphatic image to the world and somehow, because of this emptiness, they become charged with meanings from the wider culture. Their art is porous to social history. Indeed, the best way to understand this artwork may be in relation to pop music. The year in which this video was made, 1972, was the peak of Glam in pop culture and this is a Glam work of art. The ultra-stylised poses of Gilbert and George are those of self-con scious decadents, infinitely refined aesthetes, just like the image created by Roxy Music or David Bowie. Even the deeply shadowed, whited-out look of this video, which according to the artists\u2019 instructions must be shown with the contrast unnaturally high, is the same blank aesthetic we see in the portrait of Lou Reed on the cover of his 1972 album Transformer. The title of this work seems to be a joke. James Joyce\u2019s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a study of the development of an artist, of the experiences that make a sensibility. Gilbert and George on the other hand deny they ever \u201cdeveloped\u201d at all. They simply became Gilbert and George one day in a convulsive change, instant and absolute. \u201cWe have never seen a young artist\u201d, they said in an early manifesto. A Portrait of The Artists as Young Men is about masquerade, play-acting, about becoming something other that what you were told you were. Gilbert and George assert the right not just to reinvent themselves but to resemble an alien life form. They are not hiding behind masks but assert that they are the mask, the \u201csculpture\u201d. To be an artist for them is to be a kind of monster, a new species in the world. Like their contemporaries in pop, they liberate themselves by erasing the usual marks of human identity. Inspirations and influences: This could be seen as a parody of the very minimalist, very serious, artists\u2019 film of the 60s, exemplified by Michael Snow\u2019s Wavelength (1967), in which the camera zooms in slowly on a patch of wall. Gilbert and George take the deliberate tedium of minimalist film and make it a joke. In this they have a lot in common with conceptual artists such as John Baldessari and William Wegman, who used badly made video art to mock art\u2019s claim to seriousness. Today, young artists are returning to this cruder, funnier age of video. An artist whose works resemble this piece is Hilary Lloyd, who makes video portraits of apparently passive, vacuous young people. Where is it? Tate Modern, Bankside, London SE1 (020-7887 8000).",

Some of the papers he'd written for himself in the course of his reading helped persuade them that he was serious about doing a degree. Very serious, in fact. He got a gratifying first, went on to secure the coveted BPhil at Trinity College, Oxford, and then netted himself a prestigious junior research fellowship at Queen's, before taking up a teaching post at London University's Heythrop College four years ago. </p> <p>It's precisely the maverick combination of passion, rigour, patience and sedition that makes Law such an engaging writer and teacher.

Less of the supernatural, comic-book stuff, and more of what film people would call the back-story. It is too good, though, to be made into a film. What is clever about it is the way it seems to be absolutely consistent with what has happened before: either Ennis and Dillon worked this all out a long time ago, or they have very busy and productive plotting sessions.</p> <p>We find out the nasty junkie past of one of the characters (Cassidy, the alcoholic Irish vampire); and how Tulip got to be so good with a gun. Here she is finally reunited with Jesse Custer, the preacher with the cornball name and the voice of God. (He only uses it once in this volume, calling up a chat show in order to ask the pundits what it is they really want.) </p> <p>The characters continue to be chipped away at: Custer lost his eye in the previous volume, having it sucked out of its socket by God. We lose pretty much all the sympathy we had for Cassidy, and Starr, the most powerful man in the world, having lost not only an eye, all his hair and a leg, now loses his genitals to an attack dog. \"My cock is in the bitch's mouth,\" he says, \"and not in a good way.\" </p> <p>Steve Dillon and Garth Ennis don't give interviews, so let me speculate for them: about 10 years ago, Dillon, if I recall correctly, started up Deadline, a grown-up, regular comic riding on the back of the success of The Watchmen, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, and all those other graphic novels that were supposed to signal the birth of a new, respectable art form. You got the feeling that Deadline was bought by about 12 people, but they hung on for a couple of years; it became obvious how hard it was simply to fill the pages with decent stuff. (The dreadful Tank Girl film was incompetently adapted from its star strip.) </p> <p>One character, Hugo Tate, ended by emigrating to the States; I wonder if this gave Dillon an idea. You can imagine the Deadline experience - caring about intelligence and originality in a medium unusually resistant to both - depressing anyone; so Preacher represents a spiritual, if not an actual, relocation, a chance to wipe the slate clean. One recurring theme is how wonderful America is, what a great place it is to make a new start - romantic hogwash at direct variance with the facts, particularly if you are not white. </p> <p>Still. It's a comic book, so you don't have to take it all that seriously if you don't want to; and to see such pie-eyed innocence, and indeed patriotic faith, in any narrative medium these days, particularly in this one, is itself something of a novelty. That said, the volume closes with a flash-back episode so outrageously anti-French that would land Ennis and co in some trouble were the slur directed at any other nationality. </p> <p>Anyway, Ennis and Dillon have mastered the medium. They make almost all the other contenders look like amateurs, although the 2000AD stable continues, most of the time, to deliver the goods. How the Preacher series will end - one is led to presume a big, messy showdown with God - is something I very much look forward to seeing. But it is with the human stories that it works best.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Preacher: All Hell's a-Coming Garth Ennis, Steve Dillon and John McCrea (Titan Books, \u00a312.99) Buy it at BOL Volume 8 of the series now, and it still continues to surprise. Less of the supernatural, comic-book stuff, and more of what film people would call the back-story. It is too good, though, to be made into a film. What is clever about it is the way it seems to be absolutely consistent with what has happened before: either Ennis and Dillon worked this all out a long time ago, or they have very busy and productive plotting sessions. We find out the nasty junkie past of one of the characters (Cassidy, the alcoholic Irish vampire); and how Tulip got to be so good with a gun. Here she is finally reunited with Jesse Custer, the preacher with the cornball name and the voice of God. (He only uses it once in this volume, calling up a chat show in order to ask the pundits what it is they really want.) The characters continue to be chipped away at: Custer lost his eye in the previous volume, having it sucked out of its socket by God. We lose pretty much all the sympathy we had for Cassidy, and Starr, the most powerful man in the world, having lost not only an eye, all his hair and a leg, now loses his genitals to an attack dog. \"My cock is in the bitch's mouth,\" he says, \"and not in a good way.\" Steve Dillon and Garth Ennis don't give interviews, so let me speculate for them: about 10 years ago, Dillon, if I recall correctly, started up Deadline, a grown-up, regular comic riding on the back of the success of The Watchmen, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, and all those other graphic novels that were supposed to signal the birth of a new, respectable art form. You got the feeling that Deadline was bought by about 12 people, but they hung on for a couple of years; it became obvious how hard it was simply to fill the pages with decent stuff. (The dreadful Tank Girl film was incompetently adapted from its star strip.) One character, Hugo Tate, ended by emigrating to the States; I wonder if this gave Dillon an idea. You can imagine the Deadline experience - caring about intelligence and originality in a medium unusually resistant to both - depressing anyone; so Preacher represents a spiritual, if not an actual, relocation, a chance to wipe the slate clean. One recurring theme is how wonderful America is, what a great place it is to make a new start - romantic hogwash at direct variance with the facts, particularly if you are not white. Still. It's a comic book, so you don't have to take it all that seriously if you don't want to; and to see such pie-eyed innocence, and indeed patriotic faith, in any narrative medium these days, particularly in this one, is itself something of a novelty. That said, the volume closes with a flash-back episode so outrageously anti-French that would land Ennis and co in some trouble were the slur directed at any other nationality. Anyway, Ennis and Dillon have mastered the medium. They make almost all the other contenders look like amateurs, although the 2000AD stable continues, most of the time, to deliver the goods. How the Preacher series will end - one is led to presume a big, messy showdown with God - is something I very much look forward to seeing. But it is with the human stories that it works best.",

Yet among this torrent of creative energy there has been only one literary event. One of the reasons for this is that very few Brazilian books have been translated into English, while the impact of those that have is slight. Yet there is a storehouse of literary riches there; indeed, the country has produced some of the greatest writers of all time.</p> <p>In Brazil the word for poet is sometimes used as a term of endearment, as in \"How are you, my poet\", although the person addressed may never have written so much as a couplet. Yet there is a long line of magnificent real poets, from Manuel Bandeira and Carlos Drummond de Andrade to Vinicius de Moraes and Jo\u00e3o Cabral de Melo Neto, who are up there in public esteem with Pele (well, almost). </p> <p>However, there are two writers who tower above the rest; neither was a poet. The first of these is Machado de Assis (1839-1908), who is held by many to be not only Brazil's greatest writer but on a par with Henry James, Flaubert and Hardy. While his enchantingly digressive style, sly humour and merciless exposure of hypocrisy and pretentiousness have endeared him to Susan Sontag, Salman Rushdie and Louis de Berni\u00e8res, among many others, his own work stems directly from Tristram Shandy. </p> <p>Of mixed race, epileptic, an orphan, half-educted and myopic, Machado never left Rio de Janeiro, but worked as a civil servant while writing an enormous amount of every kind of literature. His output included four masterpieces of fiction, Don Casmurro, Philosopher or Dog?, Counselor Ayres' Memorial and, perhaps the most captivating, Epitaph of a Small Winner. The first chapter contains the jaunty announcement: \"I am a deceased writer not in the sense of one who has written and is now deceased, but in the sense of one who has died and is now writing.\" Shades of Will Self? Elizabeth Hardwick declared that \"in the sureness of pace, the ingratiating swerve, Machado is peerless\", and that he shares with Borges that \"wonderful musky perfume of the library\". But no dust. </p> <p>The other literary giant is Euclides de Cunha, whose epic Rebellion in the Backlands has been compared to the Seven Pillars of Wisdom. It tells of the year-long resistance of the backlands people to a brutal army campaign against the religious mystic Antonio Consolheiro and his followers in the interior of the state of Bahia. It is filled with drama, humanity and spiritual wisdom, together with dazzling descriptions of people and place. Picador has it in the excellent Travel Classics series. </p> <p>At a different level, but recognised as outstanding writers internationally, are Graciliano Ramos, whose cinematographic version of Barren Light can be seen at the NFT at the moment, Jo\u00e3o Guim\u00e3res Rosa, the Brazilian equivalent of James Joyce, and Clarice Lispector, who is often compared to Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield. Two other names can be mentioned in the same breath: Mario de Andrade, author of Macunaima, and Lima Barreto, author of The Patriot. </p> <p>The two writers best known outside Brazil are Jorge Amado, the hugely popular chronicler of life in Salvador in Bahia (Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon and Dona Flor and her two Husbands), and Paula Coelho, a worldwide bestseller. Other superb writers available in English are the darkly brilliant novelist Rubem Fonseca and the master of the short story Dalton Trevisan, plus Darcy Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Ubaldo Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Gilberto Noll, Chico Buarque, Ana Miranda and Patr\u00edcia Melo. Many more are not available but should be: Raduan Nassar, Moacyr Scliar, Milton Hartoum and Bernardo Carvalho foremost among them. </p> <p>It is surely now time for more publishers to step forward and bring these and many other writers to the attention of the English reading public, so that we can share more of this extraordinary country's riches than its music and its football.</p> <p>\u0095 Liz Calder is publishing director of Bloomsbury.</p>",

But no dust. The other literary giant is Euclides de Cunha, whose epic Rebellion in the Backlands has been compared to the Seven Pillars of Wisdom. It tells of the year-long resistance of the backlands people to a brutal army campaign against the religious mystic Antonio Consolheiro and his followers in the interior of the state of Bahia. It is filled with drama, humanity and spiritual wisdom, together with dazzling descriptions of people and place. Picador has it in the excellent Travel Classics series. At a different level, but recognised as outstanding writers internationally, are Graciliano Ramos, whose cinematographic version of Barren Light can be seen at the NFT at the moment, Jo\u00e3o Guim\u00e3res Rosa, the Brazilian equivalent of James Joyce, and Clarice Lispector, who is often compared to Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield. Two other names can be mentioned in the same breath: Mario de Andrade, author of Macunaima, and Lima Barreto, author of The Patriot. The two writers best known outside Brazil are Jorge Amado, the hugely popular chronicler of life in Salvador in Bahia (Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon and Dona Flor and her two Husbands), and Paula Coelho, a worldwide bestseller. Other superb writers available in English are the darkly brilliant novelist Rubem Fonseca and the master of the short story Dalton Trevisan, plus Darcy Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Ubaldo Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Gilberto Noll, Chico Buarque, Ana Miranda and Patr\u00edcia Melo. Many more are not available but should be: Raduan Nassar, Moacyr Scliar, Milton Hartoum and Bernardo Carvalho foremost among them. It is surely now time for more publishers to step forward and bring these and many other writers to the attention of the English reading public, so that we can share more of this extraordinary country's riches than its music and its football. \u0095 Liz Calder is publishing director of Bloomsbury.",

They have come from a building site and are complete strangers to the intellectual young Cardoso, but they recognised his island features at once.

All the leaders were ex-seminarians from the hill at Dare, in love with poetry and the latest ideas from Europe. Nicolau Lobato, the legendary Timorese general, killed in 1978, was the son of the catechism teacher Master Narciso from the same town, Soibada, as Cardoso\"s father. (Cardoso senior was a rural paramedic, not above administering himself a shot of penicillin in the buttocks.)</p> <p>Cardoso remembers the heroic Lobato (fictionalised in my own 1991 novel, The Redundancy of Courage, as Osvaldo Oliveira) as \"severe, introverted\"; he \"dressed almost monastically, read voraciously and wrote in a firm hand with a fountain pen... he always walked through Dili with a book under his arm... apparently deep in thought as if he had found an internal oasis and had decided to stay there.\" This noble, ruthless and also ambitious man would be tortured to death by the Indonesians. </p> <p>\"Xanana\" (Jose Alexandre) Gusmao, the charismatic soldier-politician who picked up the torch from Lobato and still holds it, is remembered by Cardoso spread-eagled on the ground at peacetime soccer matches: a seminarian goalkeeper \"too busy making up sonnets to actually stop any goals\". A decade later, Gusmao will write a sonnet to his Mauser, a 1914 vintage bolt-action rifle much favoured by the Falintil over Nato-era automatic weapons: its effective range of more than 1,000 metres conferred a greater chance of survival on the firer. </p> <p>The Crossing takes us from Cardoso's early childhood in East Timor (those pages redolent with the fragrance of sandalwood on the Dili dock) to early manhood and the intoxication of Afros, Cuban heels and Marx, and then the severance of exile, with the mournful notes of fado hanging in the back-alleys of Lisbon. </p> <p>Cardoso is not a political seer but the genuine article, a true creative writer - usually a beautiful but useless thing, but in the context of Timor a potent shaper of cultural identity and a reconciler. He has been well served by his translator, who has kept the Lusophone flavour in idiomatic English, and by Jill Joliffe, whose introduction is a fine piece of literary exegesis. </p> <p>This book joins the plethora of literature on East Timor. Much of it is excellent, including the journalism. Jose Ramos-Horta, the former Fretilin foreign minister in exile (like Cardoso, he survived because he was caught overseas when the Javanese invaded in 1975), has himself published memoirs, but Jose - whom I bought an oyster supper in Sydney in 1991 - will not be offended if I say his forte is as a political analyst, not, like Cardoso, as a prose stylist. </p> <p>And what an analyst. I've never seen this recorded anywhere, but it deserves to be: at the height of the Suharto economic boom, with the iron heel of the military on the entire archipelago, Xanana captured that very month, Jose predicted to me over the Chardonnay and shells that his country would win its independence \"in the next ten years\". He said Falintil could not hope to win a military victory on the ground, only to keep the flame alive. Timorese independence would come as the result of a general Indonesian economic collapse - \"you can't have all that corruption and not have a disaster in the end\". It all came true.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last month's Lisbon Book Fair came as something of a shock. Used as we were to the sprawling trade book fairs of Frankfurt, London and Book Expo in the US, the Lisbon fair - held outdoors in the Eduardo VII park with its yellow huts and blossoming jacaranda trees - was a world apart from the usual hustle and commercial hype. Our visit was funded by the Portuguese Arts Trust, a London-based organisation engaged in raising the profile of Portuguese arts in Britain, and our goal was to find out as much as possible about the current post-colonial, post-Salazar literary scene there.</p> <p>Not many people, perhaps, would view Portuguese as one of the major world languages. Yet it is spoken in Brazil, India (in Goa), East Timor and the African countries of Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, Angola and Cape Verde, following in the steps of Portuguese explorers and colonials. This legacy stretches as far as Macau, recently handed back to the Chinese authorities. It was here, so the legend at least goes, that the great poet of Portuguese navigation Cam\u00f5es is said to have written part of his wonderful epic The Lusiads. First published in 1572, this is one of the greatest poems of the Renaissance, mythologising a number of Portuguese voyages, including the story of Vasco da Gama's journey to India. </p> <p>As was the case in English with Rushdie and others in the 1980s, the empire is now \"striking back\" with a late efflorescence of literature from the former colonies. Many of these were handed back - with indecent and clumsy haste - only after the fall of the Salazar dictatorship in 1974. Today, over 200m of the world's population speak Portuguese, and the numbers are rising - so it is a language and a culture to be reckoned with. </p> <p>Arcadia, our own young publishing house, had yet to publish anything Portuguese, although we had dipped our toes into Portuguese waters by publishing the American novelist Richard Zimler's historical thriller The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon, a worldwide bestseller that first appeared in Portuguese. (Although written in English, it was initially turned down in the US and the UK; an adventurous Lisbon publisher, Quetzal, first took it on and turned it into a success in Portugal.) </p> <p>The three weeks of the fair are vital for Portuguese publishers and their authors. Jos\u00e9 Saramago, the grand old man of Portuguese letters and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998, was there, as were a wave of younger writers such as Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Agualusa, an Angolan prize-winning novelist now based in Rio; Pepetela, another Angolan writer, whose book O Desejo de Kianda will be published by Heinemann in their African Writers series; and Mia Couto, from Mozambique, one of the more widely translated and read of Africans writing in Portuguese. Serpent's Tail will publish his novel Under the Frangipani Tree next spring. </p> <p>While Portuguese literature is slowly becoming more widely published in English - especially by independent houses such as Bloomsbury, Carcanet and Peter Owen - and also in French (Portugal was the main theme of this year's Salon du Livre, the Paris Book Fair), foreign fiction is still far more widely translated into Portuguese than vice versa. But there are other types of cross-cultural fertilisation.</p> <p>Two of Arcadia's authors, Richard Zimler and the Dutch novelist Tessa de Loo, live in Portugal, as does Robert Wilson, author of A Small Death in Lisbon. After Lisbon we went to Porto, where we had dinner one evening with novelist and Chatwin biographer Nicholas Shakespeare (John Malkovich was filming Shakespeare's novel The Vision of Elena Silves there); shortly after our trip, Shena Mackay was in Lisbon for the publication of her novel The Orchard on Fire. </p> <p>On the indigenous scene, established publishers are bringing out a wealth of Portuguese writing. At the fair we had an impromptu meeting with the editorial director of Dom Quixote, whose star authors include L\u00eddia Jorge, Portugal's best-known woman writer (also published in the US), and M\u00e1rio Claudio, a prize-winning novelist, essayist and poet from Porto, whose most recent novel Ursamaior details a notorious real-life killing. </p> <p>Two publishers are housed in the Barrio Alto, a maze of narrow streets and small tiled houses. Contexto Editora is the publisher of Rita Ferro, whose bestselling fiction has been compared to the films of Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var, and of Paulo Castilho, currently the Portuguese ambassador to Sweden, whose novel Fora de Horas has won three major literary prizes. Livros Cotovia, a fine top-quality literary house, has on its list Pedro Paixao, whose quirky short stories deal with love and the pain of separation. </p> <p>Like Campo das Letras, Edi\u00e7\u00f5es ASA, Portugal's leading literary house, is based in Porto. Managing director Manuel Alberto Valente singles out the writer Jos\u00e9 Ri\u00e7o Direitinho as \"one of the most serious and promising Portuguese writers for some time\". His award-winning book Brevi\u00e1ro das M\u00e1s Inclina\u00e7\u00f5es has been published in several European languages.</p> <p>Other prominent houses include Relogio d'Agua Editores and Editorial Caminho, publisher of the Cape Verdean writer Germano Almeida, whose Os Dois Irmaos describes the killing of one brother by another. A final sum in the literary equation is the important role of the translator in making foreign fiction known in Britain. So it seems fitting to hail Margaret Jull Costa, who has just been awarded the Weidenfeld Translation Prize 2000 for her translation of Saramago's All the Names (Harvill). </p> <p>We came away with a far better understanding of Portuguese literature - and a desire to publish some of this vibrant writing ourselves. Meanwhile, look out for two new publications, The Crossing by East Timorese writer Lu\u00eds Cardoso and The Tragedy of the Street of Flowers by E\u00e7a de Queir\u00f3s, published next month (Dedalus). A new edition of de Queir\u00f3s's English Letters will be published by Carcanet in November: he was consul in England from the late 1870s. In its Aspects of Portugal series, Carcanet also publishes a wide range of classic texts, including work by Cam\u00f5es and the other doyen of Portuguese poetry, Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935).</p> <p>A strange, fascinating character, Pessoa wrote in radically different styles under a wide variety of names. Whether modernist, psychological (multiple personalities) or even occult, his literary masks looked backwards to a romantic tradition and forward to today's era of richly proliferating Portuguese identities worldwide. As Cyril Connolly wrote: \"Pessoa hived off separate personalities like swarms of bees... I have sought for his shade in those Edwardian caf\u00e9s in Lisbon which he haunted, for he was Lisbon's Cavafy or Verlaine.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Readers who would like to learn more about contemporary Portuguese writing should request a copy of the magazine Exchanging Words, available from the <a href=\"mailto:info@portugal600.demon.co.uk\">Portuguese Arts Trust</a>, tel 020-8748 0884</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last month's Lisbon Book Fair came as something of a shock. Used as we were to the sprawling trade book fairs of Frankfurt, London and Book Expo in the US, the Lisbon fair - held outdoors in the Eduardo VII park with its yellow huts and blossoming jacaranda trees - was a world apart from the usual hustle and commercial hype. Our visit was funded by the Portuguese Arts Trust, a London-based organisation engaged in raising the profile of Portuguese arts in Britain, and our goal was to find out as much as possible about the current post-colonial, post-Salazar literary scene there. Not many people, perhaps, would view Portuguese as one of the major world languages. Yet it is spoken in Brazil, India (in Goa), East Timor and the African countries of Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, Angola and Cape Verde, following in the steps of Portuguese explorers and colonials. This legacy stretches as far as Macau, recently handed back to the Chinese authorities. It was here, so the legend at least goes, that the great poet of Portuguese navigation Cam\u00f5es is said to have written part of his wonderful epic The Lusiads. First published in 1572, this is one of the greatest poems of the Renaissance, mythologising a number of Portuguese voyages, including the story of Vasco da Gama's journey to India. As was the case in English with Rushdie and others in the 1980s, the empire is now \"striking back\" with a late efflorescence of literature from the former colonies. Many of these were handed back - with indecent and clumsy haste - only after the fall of the Salazar dictatorship in 1974. Today, over 200m of the world's population speak Portuguese, and the numbers are rising - so it is a language and a culture to be reckoned with. Arcadia, our own young publishing house, had yet to publish anything Portuguese, although we had dipped our toes into Portuguese waters by publishing the American novelist Richard Zimler's historical thriller The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon, a worldwide bestseller that first appeared in Portuguese. (Although written in English, it was initially turned down in the US and the UK; an adventurous Lisbon publisher, Quetzal, first took it on and turned it into a success in Portugal.) The three weeks of the fair are vital for Portuguese publishers and their authors. Jos\u00e9 Saramago, the grand old man of Portuguese letters and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998, was there, as were a wave of younger writers such as Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Agualusa, an Angolan prize-winning novelist now based in Rio; Pepetela, another Angolan writer, whose book O Desejo de Kianda will be published by Heinemann in their African Writers series; and Mia Couto, from Mozambique, one of the more widely translated and read of Africans writing in Portuguese. Serpent's Tail will publish his novel Under the Frangipani Tree next spring. While Portuguese literature is slowly becoming more widely published in English - especially by independent houses such as Bloomsbury, Carcanet and Peter Owen - and also in French (Portugal was the main theme of this year's Salon du Livre, the Paris Book Fair), foreign fiction is still far more widely translated into Portuguese than vice versa. But there are other types of cross-cultural fertilisation. Two of Arcadia's authors, Richard Zimler and the Dutch novelist Tessa de Loo, live in Portugal, as does Robert Wilson, author of A Small Death in Lisbon. After Lisbon we went to Porto, where we had dinner one evening with novelist and Chatwin biographer Nicholas Shakespeare (John Malkovich was filming Shakespeare's novel The Vision of Elena Silves there); shortly after our trip, Shena Mackay was in Lisbon for the publication of her novel The Orchard on Fire. On the indigenous scene, established publishers are bringing out a wealth of Portuguese writing. At the fair we had an impromptu meeting with the editorial director of Dom Quixote, whose star authors include L\u00eddia Jorge, Portugal's best-known woman writer (also published in the US), and M\u00e1rio Claudio, a prize-winning novelist, essayist and poet from Porto, whose most recent novel Ursamaior details a notorious real-life killing. Two publishers are housed in the Barrio Alto, a maze of narrow streets and small tiled houses. Contexto Editora is the publisher of Rita Ferro, whose bestselling fiction has been compared to the films of Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var, and of Paulo Castilho, currently the Portuguese ambassador to Sweden, whose novel Fora de Horas has won three major literary prizes. Livros Cotovia, a fine top-quality literary house, has on its list Pedro Paixao, whose quirky short stories deal with love and the pain of separation. Like Campo das Letras, Edi\u00e7\u00f5es ASA, Portugal's leading literary house, is based in Porto. Managing director Manuel Alberto Valente singles out the writer Jos\u00e9 Ri\u00e7o Direitinho as \"one of the most serious and promising Portuguese writers for some time\". His award-winning book Brevi\u00e1ro das M\u00e1s Inclina\u00e7\u00f5es has been published in several European languages. Other prominent houses include Relogio d'Agua Editores and Editorial Caminho, publisher of the Cape Verdean writer Germano Almeida, whose Os Dois Irmaos describes the killing of one brother by another. A final sum in the literary equation is the important role of the translator in making foreign fiction known in Britain. So it seems fitting to hail Margaret Jull Costa, who has just been awarded the Weidenfeld Translation Prize 2000 for her translation of Saramago's All the Names (Harvill). We came away with a far better understanding of Portuguese literature - and a desire to publish some of this vibrant writing ourselves. Meanwhile, look out for two new publications, The Crossing by East Timorese writer Lu\u00eds Cardoso and The Tragedy of the Street of Flowers by E\u00e7a de Queir\u00f3s, published next month (Dedalus). A new edition of de Queir\u00f3s's English Letters will be published by Carcanet in November: he was consul in England from the late 1870s. In its Aspects of Portugal series, Carcanet also publishes a wide range of classic texts, including work by Cam\u00f5es and the other doyen of Portuguese poetry, Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935). A strange, fascinating character, Pessoa wrote in radically different styles under a wide variety of names. Whether modernist, psychological (multiple personalities) or even occult, his literary masks looked backwards to a romantic tradition and forward to today's era of richly proliferating Portuguese identities worldwide. As Cyril Connolly wrote: \"Pessoa hived off separate personalities like swarms of bees... I have sought for his shade in those Edwardian caf\u00e9s in Lisbon which he haunted, for he was Lisbon's Cavafy or Verlaine.\" \u0095 Readers who would like to learn more about contemporary Portuguese writing should request a copy of the magazine Exchanging Words, available from the Portuguese Arts Trust, tel 020-8748 0884",

Or maybe it dropped in from outer space. Or then again maybe its white and height are really like a lighthouse that the sea shrank back from then forgot. That doesn't matter any more. What does is how, some forty years ago and recently arrived to settle hereabouts, I made this tower the furthest fixed point of a walk and stood where I am now, four-square inside the circle of its influence, and thought these fields of silver-whiskered barley, dog-rose hedges, gravel lanes ash- and beech-tree spinnies where the roe-deer live their secret lives, would never seem so nearly elements which made a grand design if not for this: incomprehensible and silent at the heart of things. Except the silence broke. It's over there! that's what I heard - a joke against the ear as if a bird had spoken, or the air rubbed hard enough against itself to squeak - a joke I put to rest by saying carefully: there must be men at work inside the tower. It's over there! The same words tumbled down again, by which I understood I must be due for home, so barely heard them as I made my way along those gravel lanes. These gravel lanes, I mean - the same today as then, although I'm killing time in just a visit now, not life at home and what was over there I reached and passed and moved away from years ago, and still can't see - as like the wind parading through the barley while I leave the shadow of the tower and finish here as anything: a single cat's paw dabbing gingerly one minute, then a solid blow which batters down the heads so far I think they won't recover. \u0095 Commissioned by the BBC as part of Poetry Proms, a new series broadcast on Radio 3 during the interval of every Wednesday's Prom.",

He's been shortlisted for the Encore Award, and his second novel has been optioned by FilmFour. </p> <p>So why on earth has wonder boy dished up this appalling pile of garbage? I speak as one who has read all sorts of B-list literature, including much in the pleasant formulaic genre that Thorne is trying to rip off - girl-wants-to-meet-boy-and-discusses-it-endlessly-with-her-friends-in-pubs-and-caf\u00e9s. Yet Dreaming of Strangers is undoubtedly, and I would say objectively, the worst novel I have ever come across. </p> <p>The intriguing question is: why has he done it? I think I know. Being an acquisitive chap, he's noted that the above-mentioned genre - almost invariably written by women for women - generates massive sales. Then he's skimmed a few and decided it's money for old rope. He's bashed one out (how long did it take, Matt? A week?) and is now sitting back waiting for the millions to roll in. It's clear that he considers women readers so thick that they will read absolute trash providing it's about relationships. </p> <p>Well, if they read this in any numbers I'll eat every single published copy of this review.

      "bodyText": "Dreaming of Strangers Matt Thorne Weidenfeld, \u00a39.99, 243pp Buy it at BOL The author of this book is only 25, yet he's already published two novels (Tourist and Eight Minutes Idle) to cries of \"Astonishing!\" (Mail on Sunday), \"Marvellous!\" (The Times), \"Glorious!\" (Daily Telegraph). He's been shortlisted for the Encore Award, and his second novel has been optioned by FilmFour. So why on earth has wonder boy dished up this appalling pile of garbage? I speak as one who has read all sorts of B-list literature, including much in the pleasant formulaic genre that Thorne is trying to rip off - girl-wants-to-meet-boy-and-discusses-it-endlessly-with-her-friends-in-pubs-and-caf\u00e9s. Yet Dreaming of Strangers is undoubtedly, and I would say objectively, the worst novel I have ever come across. The intriguing question is: why has he done it? I think I know. Being an acquisitive chap, he's noted that the above-mentioned genre - almost invariably written by women for women - generates massive sales. Then he's skimmed a few and decided it's money for old rope. He's bashed one out (how long did it take, Matt? A week?) and is now sitting back waiting for the millions to roll in. It's clear that he considers women readers so thick that they will read absolute trash providing it's about relationships. Well, if they read this in any numbers I'll eat every single published copy of this review. I won't bore you with the plot, but let me give you a taste of what I mean. On page 188, Scarlett finally asks Becca to describe her affair with Chris. Becca replies: \"Really, Scarlett, I'm going to disappoint you.

His conclusion is that the right basis for the European Union should be \"liberal constitutionalism\", something like the United States' pattern. It would be better, he says, than any of the three models available in Europe: the French one, which is about \"power\"; the German one, which is about \"authority\"; and the British one, itiated by its \"informality\" and \"idiosyncracy\". </p> <p>But is the European Union, in fact, a state in the making? Siedentop's fundamental mistake is to take for granted that what is emerging in Europe is a version of nation-state government. His explanation of why we should consider the EU as such a thing is embarrassingly thin - confined to a single page.</p> <p>The book asserts that debate about the EU's constitution is \"impoverished\", but Siedentop's explanation - too much \"economics\", not enough \"citizenship\" - misses the obvious reason. The would-be European state is simply unreal. Siedentop does not mention the judgment of the German Constitutional Court on the Maastricht Treaty, which argued that it was questionable whether an alternative European democracy was possible in the absence of a European \"demos\" - a population which could act together. </p> <p>The constitutional debates surrounding German federalism, the French Fifth Republic and the Spanish transition to a decentralised constitutional monarchy - none of them discussed by Siedentop - can hardly be said to be \"impoverished\". But then, Germany, France, Spain and Britain are real countries with real peoples and Europe is not. </p> <p>What Siedentop describes as \"the rapid accumulation of power in Brussels\" is not about making a new state. It is almost entirely related to a single project, now largely complete, of removing legal barriers to the free movement within the Union of goods, services and people. First, this project is largely a negative one - the removal of barriers. Second, with the possible exception of the creation of a single money, the powers accumulated in Brussels are all of the third or second order of political significance - trade, agriculture, business regulation. And third, real power in the \"integration\" process (monetary union and the European Central Bank excepted) remains with the member states. </p> <p>Europe's legitimacy, in short, is derived strictly from the legitimacy of the member states. That it will remain so seems confirmed by the response to Joschka Fischer's recent proposal for a European federal constitution - hostility or deafening silence from all quarters excepting President Chirac, who proposes as an alternative the intensification of the special relationship between the French and German states. </p> <p>But will the creation of Emu lead to the creation of a European state? Siedentop assumes that it will - and many agree: both the integrationists, who believe that a single money cannot survive without an \"economic government\", and the anti-integrationists, especially in Britain, who fear that this is true. </p> <p>But both may be wrong. Beyond the elementary rules of the common currency's Stability Pact - ceilings on public deficits and public borrowing - the success of Emu does not depend upon the same level of direct taxes in member countries and a system of transferring resources from rich to poor. History may well come to see Emu not as the decisive step towards European \"federalism\", but merely as the final step in the creation of the European single market. </p> <p>But that makes Emu nothing more than the Gold Standard in modern dress. And if, meanwhile, most of what \"Brussels\" does is pretty small beer and the member states are always in the driving seat, what remains of Siedentop's emerging European state, crying out for its James Madisons, Alexander Hamiltons and Thomas Jeffersons? Precious little. </p> <p>Having said all this, it is quite probable that, over the next few years, we will find ourselves called upon to agree to something which some may well call a European constitution. The \"competences\" of the different levels of European government will be fixed. The treaties will be tidied up. All this will be greeted with fanfares in some quarters and loathing in others. But the likely \"European constitution\" will just be a decking out in \"European\" clothes of what already exists. Meanwhile, the sinews of the European Union will be slackened by enlargement to 25 states, bringing with it another 100m \"European citizens\". </p> <p>Running through Siedentop's analysis is the conviction that institutions build cultures. But what if the relation runs the other way - what if it is actually cultures that build institutions? Might not Siedentop's \"idealism\" then lead to the creation of institutions that are rejected by the cultures they purport to rebuild, or remain empty because they outstrip the reality of those cultures? </p> <p>There is, however, little danger of this. \"Europe\" will remain what it always has been - a projection of the interests and concerns of its member states.

Yet in its clear sympathies and wrenching satire, Tuff offers a riposte to a world where \"street\" style sells and Puff Daddy does Vogue shoots, but subway riders clutch their belongings at the sight of anyone resembling Winston. Both solemn and very funny, it insistently finds poetry in the projects, dignity on the street.",

This was a huge number on any criterion - except that of Thomas Paine's historic answer to Burke, The Rights of Man, which sold at least 2m.</p> <p>Paine was beaten to the post by an anonymous author who was obviously even more offended by Burke's sonorous snobbery. Only 28 days after the Reflections hit the streets, a furious little book entitled A Vindication of the Rights of Men was produced by the republican publisher Joseph Johnson. It sold so well that Johnson brought out another edition three weeks later. This time the author was revealed as Mary Wollstonecraft, 31, who had written several progressive stories and booklets for Johnson but had not yet tried her hand at political polemic. The revelation of the author's name led to predictable outrage. Horace Walpole, for instance, denounced her as a \"hyena in petticoats\". </p> <p>The hyena had not finished yowling. In January 1792, Johnson brought out another book by Wollstonecraft. This was A Vindication of the Rights of Women, which became a feminist textbook for 200 years and more. Despite its slightly bossy style - which owed a lot to the author's training as a governess - the new book infuriated important men almost as rapidly as it absorbed Johnson's growing female readership.</p> <p>Not all the angry men were reactionaries. William Godwin, whose Political Justice (1793) was very fortunate to escape prosecution for sedition, denounced the Vindication as \"deficient in method and arrangement\". Godwin met Wollstonecraft at literary dinner parties and was irritated by her strong views - and especially by her strong expression of them.</p> <p>In her works and in her conversation, Wollstonecraft directed her fire at received notions, particularly the complementary nature of men and women - he the leader, in Janet Todd's words, \"rational, ambitious and strong\"; she the led, \"emotional, intuitive and tender\". Mary favoured equality and independence for women. \"I do not wish women to have power over men,\" she observed, \"but over themselves.\" </p> <p>Her rebellious spirit reacted in opposite ways to most of her contemporaries. In December 1792, as English exiles flocked out of France to escape the Revolution's turn to the left, she settled as a lone woman in Paris. Her enthusiasm for the Revolution was tested to the full by the persecution and execution of most of her Girondist friends. Todd tells us that Wollstonecraft preferred \"moderate republican bourgeois\" to \"street\" revolutionaries, but she never joined what she called \"the shallow herd who throw an odium on immutable principles because the mere instruments of the revolution were too sharp\". </p> <p>Another of Wollstonecraft's earlier views was then put to the test. In the Vindication she had urged that passion should be controlled by reason, and had deprecated men and women who became slaves to their sexual passions. These views went side by side with her sexual abstinence. Her early crush on the painter Henry Fuseli was not consummated, but in revolutionary France she engaged in a passionate love affair with a self-styled American \"captain\" called Gilbert Imlay.</p> <p>All her inhibitions were swept away by this relationship, which resulted in a little girl, Fanny. The affair lasted for a few glorious months until Imlay, pleading business priorities, abandoned Mary and Fanny. In his romantic biographical adventure, Footsteps (1985), Richard Holmes pleads that Imlay \"stands undefended before the bar of history\", and points out that Imlay, by falsely announcing that he was married to Mary, probably saved her life. But to Todd, Imlay was a \"speculator\", in business and in love.</p> <p>At any rate, his abrupt departure and his refusal to respond to endless pleas to return ruined Wollstonecraft's life. Eventually she followed him to England and agreed to his fantastic proposition that she should travel, with a Parisian maid and her baby, to Scandinavia on a hunt for a ship full of French silver which Imlay believed had been stolen from him.</p> <p>This extraordinary mission - travelling in deep despondency, over dangerous seas and by any rickety transport she could hire, to some of the most remote towns and villages in Europe - makes up the most astonishing part of this biography. Throughout her long \"symphonies of pain\" Wollstonecraft never abandoned her beliefs or gave up hope of a better world. Through her return to England, her final dismissal by Imlay, her thwarted suicide leap from Putney Bridge, her marriage to William Godwin and her utterly sad (and utterly avoidable) death in childbirth, she clung firmly to her principles. \"I am content to be wretched,\" she sighed, \"but I will not be contemptible.\" </p> <p>This is not a hagiography. Wollstonecraft's unpredictable and often contradictory behaviour is not ignored or excused. But although she is once accused, grotesquely, of \"sounding like Burke in his Reflections\", neither is she short-changed. The full force of her achievement emerges more strongly from stern criticism; as does the fact that her life was, above all else, a revolutionary one.</p> <p>My only gripe is that the book is too long. Great academic biographers should have more pity on their readers. I would cheerfully have swapped at least 100 pages of Mary's dreary family for a short summary of her posthumous reputation. There is, for instance, only one reference in all these 500 pages to Shelley, who married Mary's daughter and was all his life inspired by her views. His longest poem, \"The Revolt of Islam\", is dedicated to his wife, but the dedication throbs with admiration and affection for the mother-in-law he never met: </p> <p> They say that thou wert lovely from thy birth, </p> <p>Of glorious parents thou aspiring child. </p> <p>I wonder not - for One then left this earth </p> <p>Whose life was like a setting planet mild, </p> <p>Which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled </p> <p>Of its departing glory; still her fame </p> <p>Shines on thee, through the tempests dark and wild </p> <p>Which shake these latter days.</p>",

But his preference is to follow the shore of Crummock Water past the peninsula of Low Link Crag where's he's often swum and rowed with his family. The finale is crossing the meadows of wild flowers at the head of the lake and walking through Lanthwaite Wood, a plantation of conifers from the 1950s which the National Trust is gradually replanting with hardwood trees - an example of the steady improvement that Melchett sees in the Lake District landscape. </p> <p>Two other examples, he says, are the skillful rebuilding of paths in areas that were heavily eroded, and the recent decision to impose a 10mph speed limit which will curb powerboating on Windermere. \"I think the Lake District has over the years become less spoilt because it's being so well managed,\" he says. </p> <p>\"It's a question of being intelligent and stopping things that do permanent damage, such as new roads, conifer plantations and certain kinds of buildings. The conifer forests planted last century have left scars that will take hundreds of years to repair.\" </p> <p>As an organic farmer, he would like to see an increase in cattle grazing in the Lake District, which would control the bracken which has taken over some hillsides, untouched by sheep because it poisons them: \"There are some beef cattle around - we've seen big Charolais bulls just to the north and east of Loweswater.

As assessment of achievements and disappointments is also going on. </p> <p>Robin Barratt, chairman of the Friends of the Lake District pressure group, said the National Park could take credit for getting speed limits on Ullswater, Coniston, Derwentwater and Windermere, and using its planning powers to help preserve the landscape. </p> <p>But it had failed to prevent many developments that worked against the park's founding principle of \"quiet enjoyment\" and took away a sense of discovery and adventure: \"There is too much signing, too much promotion of everything, including footpaths, everything laid on a plate,\" he said. </p> <p>Bob Cartwright, head of park management at the Lake District National Park Authority, said it had recon ciled huge development pressures with preserving a supremely beautiful landscape.

      "body": "<p>It must have all come as a bit of a shock to the Queen last Tuesday. First she had to contend with the blue and purple abstractions breaking out of the neat sandstone facade of the new British Embassy. Then there was the view from inside the space-age glass bubble that crowns the Reichstag building restored by Norman Foster. </p> <p>And, oh ma'am, what a view. It must have looked to her like some animus horribilis was at work. For Berlin, the self-proclaimed new capital of Europe, is not that easy on the eye just yet. A forest of yellow cranes still towers over the biggest building site in Europe and brave-new-world architecture stands side by side with reclad relics from the collapsed East and scaffolded shells from the war. </p> <p>Beyond this megalopolis in the making, Berlin is not the sort of place that instantly seduces you anyway. It lacks the intimacy of little squares and riverside caf\u00e9s. There's no discernible centre, and the distances between locations are too great to walk. It's difficult to get your head around the geography of the city, but that is hardly surprising given that, until the Wall was torn down almost 11 years ago, it was divided into two cities with two centres, two easts, wests, norths and souths. </p> <p>Which makes what is happening there all the more exciting - the greatest experiment in urban planning in modern times is being matched by an equally uplifting energy in the arts and the nightlife. By day, you can work your way through the Who's Who of architects and trawl through an extraordinary range of galleries. By night, you can hop between designer bars, cocktail lounges and nightclubs - although crawl is probably nearer the mark, as there are no closing times in a city that genuinely doesn't sleep. </p> <p>All of this combines to make Berlin the fourth most popular city destination in Europe after London, Paris and Rome. God knows it needs the injection of tourism cash, as it has sunk billions into building this city of the future. And we Brits are leading the way in Europe, according to the latest figures from the Berlin tourist board, bolstered largely by our bullish pound. A decent hotel room can be had for as little as \u00a370 a night, a good meal for two with wine for around \u00a340 and the beer goes down nicely at \u00a32 a pint. </p> <p><strong> What to see </strong><br> </p> <p> Where to begin? The best way to get your bearings is to sign up for a city tour. The cheapest one is on the top deck of the regular number 100 bus, which passes most of the major sights, all for a DM3.90 ticket. Alternatively, <a href=\"http://www.insidertour.com\">the Insider Tour</a> the Insider Tour is a three-and-a-half-hour guided walk conducted in English (DM20, tel: +49 30 692 3149). Also, lots of boats run up and down the River Spree - the commentary is in German, but the journey is relaxing enough (City Schiffahrt charges DM12 from the back of the Berlin Cathedral). </p> <p>Walk up Unter den Linden from Friedrichstrasse to Alexanderplatz. Much of Berlin's turbulent history is encapsulated in this stretch. There are grandiose edifices built under Frederick II, destroyed in the second world war and rebuilt by the communist authorities. Across the street from the Humboldt University is Bebelplatz, flanked by the State Opera House and St Hedwigs' cathedral, where the Nazis started burning books on May 10 1933. Behind the Berlin cathedral and the Pergamon Museum on Museumsinsel sits the Communist kitsch of the television tower in Alexanderplatz (for 9DM, you can take the elevator up to the observation deck). </p> <p>At the other end of Unter den Linden is the Brandenburg Gate, symbol of the city's division in the Cold War, stranded in no man's land behind the eastern side of the Wall; and the nearby Reichstag building, temple of Germany's re-unification. You can take a tour of the Reichstag and go up to the viewing gallery inside the glass dome, but get there early to avoid the two-hour queues (tours run 9am-10pm, and the building closes at midnight). </p> <p>Potsdamer Platz is the centrepiece of Europe's boom town, a collection of futuristic high-rise office buildings and a pedestrianised forum with shops, cinemas, caf\u00e9s and restaurants designed by some of the world's most celebrated architects. </p> <p><strong> Museums </strong><br> </p> <p> Of the 170 museums, one of the most stunning is the Hamburger Bahnhoff, a converted railway station in Invalidenstrasse, Mitte, that opened in 1997. The interiors are cavernous and light with white glass tiles in the arched roofs, and the exhibits include Andy Warhol drawings from the 1950s and silk-screen prints of Mao and the Mona Lisa. </p> <p>Just up from one of the few remaining segments of the Wall and next to the location of Hitler's secret bunker is the Martin-Gropius-Bau museum (Niederkirchnerstrasse 7, Mitte). This houses the city's millennium exhibition, Seven Hills - images and signs of the 21st century, which has, as its centrepiece, a futuristic installation by set designer Ken Adams of Bond and Dr Strangelove fame. It is breathtaking in its range, featuring 2,000 exhibits from more than 400 sources throughout the world. On until October 29. </p> <p>The Jewish Museum (Lindenstrasse 15, Kreuzberg) is a series of zigzag metal buildings with slashes for windows that suggest scars. The layout and the uneven floors are designed to induce a feeling of dislocation and disorientation, reflecting the Jewish experience during the Holocaust. </p> <p>When the cultural overload starts to kick in - and it will - clear your head with a stroll through the Tiergarten, the sprawling park that had to be replanted after the original trees were chopped down for firewood in 1945. </p> <p><strong> Where to drink </strong><br> </p> <p> Unwind over kaffee und kuchen (cake). One of the most famous spots is Caf\u00e9 Adler (Friedrichstrasse 206) overlooking the site of Checkpoint Charlie, the one-time gateway between East and West. While you're spoiling yourself with strudel (4DM) and sipping milchkaffee from a bowl (5.50DM) in the salon downstairs, bear in mind that at the height of the Cold War the CIA were installed on the third floor and the Stasi were located just over the street. </p> <p>Most caf\u00e9s also serve food and alcohol, but if you want to keep your powder dry for a night on the town, head over to Oranienburger Strasse in the district of Mitte. This strip of designer bars, lounges and restaurants in the former impoverished east has long since stolen the in-crowd away from the once glittering Kuf\u00fcrstendamm in the west. Resident DJs provide a background of chilled-out sounds in most places, and they don't charge an entrance fee. The refreshing thing about Berlin's bars - apart from their cocktails, of course - is that no matter how self-consciously stylish they appear, they welcome all - young and old, hip and square - with none of the snooty attitude of their London counterparts. It's as though, having lived in a divided society for so long, they are no longer willing to tolerate barriers of any sort. </p> <p>Start at the Friedrichstrasse end, opposite the run-down squats colonised by artists when the Wall came down, and kick off with a cocktail from 808 Bar &amp; Lounge (16DM a go). </p> <p>Silberstein, up the road, is a more rigidly stylised venue with absurdly high-backed iron chairs. Here the new black is black. The waiters and waitresses are resting between parts, and the DJ is saving up for his return ticket back from the dark side. </p> <p>Just off Oranienburger is a string of venues in the railway arches in Hackescher Markt. Resist the temptation to go al fresco at Zucca and sit inside under the art-deco chandeliers listening to the latest remixes. </p> <p><strong> Where to eat </strong><br> </p> <p> A civilised way to start the day is over a leisurely DM20 breakfast in the garden of the Caf\u00e9 im Literaturhaus (Fasanenstrasse 23, Charlottenburg), a turn-of-the-century villa that shares a street in the upmarket side of town with the likes of Gucci, Chanel and Cartier. </p> <p>Lunch at Caf\u00e9 Aedes in Hackesche H\u00f6fe (Rosenthaler Strasse, Mitte) - a labyrinth of courtyards housing bookshops, galleries theatres and artists' workshops. A simple bowl of Berlinner Kartofellsuppe und weiner - thick potato soup with slices of sausage - costs DM9.50. </p> <p>In the evening, take a taxi over to Kreuzberg - known as the \"multi-kulti\" sector of town because of the number of alternative types who moved here to dodge conscription and the large Turkish population - for a taste of Austria in Jolesch (corner of Muskauer Strasse and Zeughofstrasse). A meal for two with a bottle of wine weighs in at \u00a330. </p> <p>Or go up to the Dachgarten Restaurant inside the dome at the Reichstag. It's a little pricier, with main dishes from DM45 to DM49, but it's worth it for the view and, if you have a reservation, you automatically jump the queue (tel: +49 30 22 62 99 33). </p> <p><strong> Where to stay </strong><br> </p> <p> Hotels are relatively cheap in Berlin - rooms at the normally heavy-hitting Four Seasons, for instance, start at 510DM for a double, a fraction of the cost of those in other cities. \"Art hotels\", with paintings and installations, have sprung up all over the city, but the original one is <a href=\"http://www.sorat-hotels.com\">Sorat Art'otel</a> in Joachimstaler Strasse, just off the Kuf\u00fcrstendamm in Charlottenburg (+49 30 88 44 70), featuring the work of artist Wolf Vostell.

      "bodyText": "It must have all come as a bit of a shock to the Queen last Tuesday. First she had to contend with the blue and purple abstractions breaking out of the neat sandstone facade of the new British Embassy. Then there was the view from inside the space-age glass bubble that crowns the Reichstag building restored by Norman Foster. And, oh ma'am, what a view. It must have looked to her like some animus horribilis was at work. For Berlin, the self-proclaimed new capital of Europe, is not that easy on the eye just yet. A forest of yellow cranes still towers over the biggest building site in Europe and brave-new-world architecture stands side by side with reclad relics from the collapsed East and scaffolded shells from the war. Beyond this megalopolis in the making, Berlin is not the sort of place that instantly seduces you anyway. It lacks the intimacy of little squares and riverside caf\u00e9s. There's no discernible centre, and the distances between locations are too great to walk. It's difficult to get your head around the geography of the city, but that is hardly surprising given that, until the Wall was torn down almost 11 years ago, it was divided into two cities with two centres, two easts, wests, norths and souths. Which makes what is happening there all the more exciting - the greatest experiment in urban planning in modern times is being matched by an equally uplifting energy in the arts and the nightlife. By day, you can work your way through the Who's Who of architects and trawl through an extraordinary range of galleries. By night, you can hop between designer bars, cocktail lounges and nightclubs - although crawl is probably nearer the mark, as there are no closing times in a city that genuinely doesn't sleep. All of this combines to make Berlin the fourth most popular city destination in Europe after London, Paris and Rome. God knows it needs the injection of tourism cash, as it has sunk billions into building this city of the future. And we Brits are leading the way in Europe, according to the latest figures from the Berlin tourist board, bolstered largely by our bullish pound. A decent hotel room can be had for as little as \u00a370 a night, a good meal for two with wine for around \u00a340 and the beer goes down nicely at \u00a32 a pint. What to see Where to begin? The best way to get your bearings is to sign up for a city tour. The cheapest one is on the top deck of the regular number 100 bus, which passes most of the major sights, all for a DM3.90 ticket. Alternatively, the Insider Tour the Insider Tour is a three-and-a-half-hour guided walk conducted in English (DM20, tel: +49 30 692 3149). Also, lots of boats run up and down the River Spree - the commentary is in German, but the journey is relaxing enough (City Schiffahrt charges DM12 from the back of the Berlin Cathedral). Walk up Unter den Linden from Friedrichstrasse to Alexanderplatz. Much of Berlin's turbulent history is encapsulated in this stretch. There are grandiose edifices built under Frederick II, destroyed in the second world war and rebuilt by the communist authorities. Across the street from the Humboldt University is Bebelplatz, flanked by the State Opera House and St Hedwigs' cathedral, where the Nazis started burning books on May 10 1933. Behind the Berlin cathedral and the Pergamon Museum on Museumsinsel sits the Communist kitsch of the television tower in Alexanderplatz (for 9DM, you can take the elevator up to the observation deck). At the other end of Unter den Linden is the Brandenburg Gate, symbol of the city's division in the Cold War, stranded in no man's land behind the eastern side of the Wall; and the nearby Reichstag building, temple of Germany's re-unification. You can take a tour of the Reichstag and go up to the viewing gallery inside the glass dome, but get there early to avoid the two-hour queues (tours run 9am-10pm, and the building closes at midnight). Potsdamer Platz is the centrepiece of Europe's boom town, a collection of futuristic high-rise office buildings and a pedestrianised forum with shops, cinemas, caf\u00e9s and restaurants designed by some of the world's most celebrated architects. Museums Of the 170 museums, one of the most stunning is the Hamburger Bahnhoff, a converted railway station in Invalidenstrasse, Mitte, that opened in 1997. The interiors are cavernous and light with white glass tiles in the arched roofs, and the exhibits include Andy Warhol drawings from the 1950s and silk-screen prints of Mao and the Mona Lisa. Just up from one of the few remaining segments of the Wall and next to the location of Hitler's secret bunker is the Martin-Gropius-Bau museum (Niederkirchnerstrasse 7, Mitte). This houses the city's millennium exhibition, Seven Hills - images and signs of the 21st century, which has, as its centrepiece, a futuristic installation by set designer Ken Adams of Bond and Dr Strangelove fame. It is breathtaking in its range, featuring 2,000 exhibits from more than 400 sources throughout the world. On until October 29. The Jewish Museum (Lindenstrasse 15, Kreuzberg) is a series of zigzag metal buildings with slashes for windows that suggest scars. The layout and the uneven floors are designed to induce a feeling of dislocation and disorientation, reflecting the Jewish experience during the Holocaust. When the cultural overload starts to kick in - and it will - clear your head with a stroll through the Tiergarten, the sprawling park that had to be replanted after the original trees were chopped down for firewood in 1945. Where to drink Unwind over kaffee und kuchen (cake). One of the most famous spots is Caf\u00e9 Adler (Friedrichstrasse 206) overlooking the site of Checkpoint Charlie, the one-time gateway between East and West. While you're spoiling yourself with strudel (4DM) and sipping milchkaffee from a bowl (5.50DM) in the salon downstairs, bear in mind that at the height of the Cold War the CIA were installed on the third floor and the Stasi were located just over the street. Most caf\u00e9s also serve food and alcohol, but if you want to keep your powder dry for a night on the town, head over to Oranienburger Strasse in the district of Mitte. This strip of designer bars, lounges and restaurants in the former impoverished east has long since stolen the in-crowd away from the once glittering Kuf\u00fcrstendamm in the west. Resident DJs provide a background of chilled-out sounds in most places, and they don't charge an entrance fee. The refreshing thing about Berlin's bars - apart from their cocktails, of course - is that no matter how self-consciously stylish they appear, they welcome all - young and old, hip and square - with none of the snooty attitude of their London counterparts. It's as though, having lived in a divided society for so long, they are no longer willing to tolerate barriers of any sort. Start at the Friedrichstrasse end, opposite the run-down squats colonised by artists when the Wall came down, and kick off with a cocktail from 808 Bar &amp; Lounge (16DM a go). Silberstein, up the road, is a more rigidly stylised venue with absurdly high-backed iron chairs. Here the new black is black. The waiters and waitresses are resting between parts, and the DJ is saving up for his return ticket back from the dark side. Just off Oranienburger is a string of venues in the railway arches in Hackescher Markt. Resist the temptation to go al fresco at Zucca and sit inside under the art-deco chandeliers listening to the latest remixes. Where to eat A civilised way to start the day is over a leisurely DM20 breakfast in the garden of the Caf\u00e9 im Literaturhaus (Fasanenstrasse 23, Charlottenburg), a turn-of-the-century villa that shares a street in the upmarket side of town with the likes of Gucci, Chanel and Cartier. Lunch at Caf\u00e9 Aedes in Hackesche H\u00f6fe (Rosenthaler Strasse, Mitte) - a labyrinth of courtyards housing bookshops, galleries theatres and artists' workshops. A simple bowl of Berlinner Kartofellsuppe und weiner - thick potato soup with slices of sausage - costs DM9.50. In the evening, take a taxi over to Kreuzberg - known as the \"multi-kulti\" sector of town because of the number of alternative types who moved here to dodge conscription and the large Turkish population - for a taste of Austria in Jolesch (corner of Muskauer Strasse and Zeughofstrasse). A meal for two with a bottle of wine weighs in at \u00a330. Or go up to the Dachgarten Restaurant inside the dome at the Reichstag. It's a little pricier, with main dishes from DM45 to DM49, but it's worth it for the view and, if you have a reservation, you automatically jump the queue (tel: +49 30 22 62 99 33). Where to stay Hotels are relatively cheap in Berlin - rooms at the normally heavy-hitting Four Seasons, for instance, start at 510DM for a double, a fraction of the cost of those in other cities. \"Art hotels\", with paintings and installations, have sprung up all over the city, but the original one is Sorat Art'otel in Joachimstaler Strasse, just off the Kuf\u00fcrstendamm in Charlottenburg (+49 30 88 44 70), featuring the work of artist Wolf Vostell. A stylistic snip starting at DM165 a night. Five of the best clubs 1 WMF Ziegelstrasse 23, Berlin-Mitte Cool arrogant DJs draw trendsetters, artists and celebs. 2 KIT KAT@Metropol Nollendorfplatz 5, Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg Dress code demands visitors wear as little as possible. 3 Shark Club Friedrichstrasse, Berlin-Mitte Doorkeepers are tough, but if you have a collection of credit cards and a model in tow, they'll have mercy. 4 Kaffee Burger Torstrasse 60, Berlin-Mitte Psychedelic interior and an eclectic mix of music 5 Tresor Club Leipziger Strasse 126a, Berlin-Mitte Once the cradle of techno, now a party zone for suburban ravers. The practicals Virgin Express (0207 772 0004) flies from London Stansted to Berlin-Sch\u00f6nefeld airport from \u00a358 return. Buzz flies from Stansted to Berlin Tegel for \u00a385 return. German Travel Centre (020 8429 2900) offers return flights for \u00a3100, overnight stays for \u00a3130. A WelcomeCard allows three days travel on all Berlin's public transport systems and costs DM32; it also offers discounts on a number of attractions.

Sarah Kenyon Rail fares in Italy are based on the distance travelled so: Florence to Sienna is 8,000 lire, Sienna to Chiusi 8,000 lire, Chiusi to Rome 14,500 lire. Don't buy a Biglietto Chilo metrico costing \u00a388 in UK. It is valid for 3,000km, but you need to travel nearly the full distance buying second-class tickets as you go before you show a small profit. David Gill You can check out train timetables on www.fs-on-line.it. Gregorius Garber Larger hotels in major towns are as expensive as anywhere, but the low-star hotels are excellent value. Lists available in all towns and from the Italian Tourist Office. Chris and Joyce Peel This week's question My partner and I are planning a walking honeymoon on Mallorca in November. We want to do this as cheaply as possible. Can anyone recommend a good website for flights leaving from either Exeter or Bristol and reasonably-priced accommodation?

The 35-year-old Lane made her stage debut aged six, starred opposite Laurence Olivier in A Little Romance when she was 13, and has been in four of Francis Ford Coppola's films. She lives in LA with her six-year-old daughter.</p> <p><strong>Why would people want to risk their lives to catch fish? </strong></p> <p>I think it's the unpredictability of it and some people really get off on risk. It's in our nature, not to tempt fate, but to push the envelope. I had no idea until I read Sebastian Junger's book about what fishing involved. To go through so much and maybe return with no fish, it's so unfair.</p> <p><strong>Would you be happy to wait at home while your man went to sea?</strong></p> <p>I don't think you choose who you fall in love with, so that's a hard question to answer. I certainly understand what it's like to be frustrated by time and distance and waiting. But this added element of surviving is more intense. I guess if I were married to a stuntman that would be close.</p> <p><strong>The movie's based on a true story, so was it strange playing a woman who is still alive?</strong></p> <p>It's a fine balance. I didn't want to meet her until I had gotten enough of the character on film. I was concerned that she'd give me information that I couldn't use, which is a terrible feeling, because I had no input on the screenplay. I wasn't sure if she'd know that and I was afraid she'd say, \"Here's what really happened.\" She was written as quite an impetuous person in the book, so I didn't know what to expect.</p> <p><strong>So what was Christina like?</strong></p> <p>She's changed quite a bit from the woman that we're portraying in the film. She's a little more mature, a little more patient with herself. It's nine years ago now. We had dinner last night and it was great because I finally got to complete the loop between us. I really wanted her blessing to play her.</p> <p><strong>How hard was it to make the transition from being a child actor to an adult one?</strong></p> <p>Well, the business has changed quite a bit.

I guess old Hollywood was kind of a factory and they controlled everything, so maybe I'm just being naive.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I like to think of myself as something of an expert on theme parks and white knuckle rides, having ridden such rollercoasters as Oblivion, Space Mountain and the Big One, so I was confident that nothing in Port Aventura, Universal Studios' theme park in Spain, could shake me. </p> <p>But even as we approached the 2,000-acre site just outside Salou on the Costa Daurada I could see the tracks of several rides soaring into the sky and realised this was no wimp's scene. This was the real thing: towering heights, dizzying speeds and death-defying drops. </p> <p>The park is divided into five \"worlds\": the Mediterranean, the Far West, Polynesia, Mexico and China, with appropriately themed rides, shops, games and restaurants. My favourite was China, home to the dreaded Dragon Khan, the only rollercoaster in the world with eight loops. </p> <p>This ride even looks scary, with its tangled mass of red metal showing more twists and turns than an episode of Sunset Beach. It leaves your heart in your mouth and your stomach doing somersaults. It begins with a steep nerve-wracking climb up a diagonal track. Then just as you're wondering whether you should have written your will, you're off - a mind-boggling drop followed by a series of angled twists where you feel not just that you will fall out of your seat as you do on most rides, but that the 32-seater car will leave the track altogether. It is this fear and the sensation of being whizzed upside down a staggering eight times and turned on your side that pumps the adrenalin round your body. </p> <p>The big new attraction at Port Aventura that opened in May this year is the \u00a316m Sea Odyssey, which claims to be the world's most technologically-advanced underwater simulator. The concept is that guests are taken on a deep-sea voyage by a research scientist and a talking dolphin to search for and rescue a trapped vessel from a dormant volcano. The effects are achieved by a mixture of a giant screen with high resolution images and moving seats that pitch and shake as you \"travel\" through the ocean encountering various hazards and adventures on route. The experience of being sprayed with water as you battle with sea beasts, dodge the baddies and rescue stranded divers adds to the authenticity. </p> <p>There really is plenty for everyone at Port Aventura. There are more than 90 rides ranging from those for the very small to the older and more daring. We also managed the Stampida, an effectively rackety wooden roller coaster in which two cars race against each other. </p> <p>The water rides are well worth a try although if you start your day with one, as we did, you might be better off not laughingly waving aside the offer of a waterproof coat: the Tutuki Splash, for example, should be renamed the Tutuki Soak. Wet through but wised up, we then saved the Grand Canyon Rapids and the Silver River Flume until last. Getting splashed can, however, be quite refreshing in the Spanish sun. </p> <p>Of course, there were queues, the bane of every theme park visitor's life, but they were not too bad on the day we went.

Not enough white-knuckle rides, but brilliant for families.</p> <p><strong>Anna's top 10 tips</strong></p> <p><strong> 1</strong> Find out in advance where the camera is that's going to capture you at the scariest point. That way, you can prepare a cheeky grin or cool pout. </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> Get a map and plan the day ahead, especially if you are part of a large group - there's nothing worse than arguments over what ride to go on next. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Work your way up to the bigger rides. If you go on them first, all the rest will seem too tame in comparison. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Rides that attract long queues are more accessible during big parades. Queues are shorter in Spain at lunchtime. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Don't wear heels. They're uncomfortable, and you may have to remove them in front of everyone so the park stewards can check your height. </p> <p><strong> 6</strong> Word games can take your mind off long queues and pre-ride nerves. </p> <p><strong> 7</strong> Don't eat a huge meal, double scoop ice cream, can of cola or candy floss just before you go on a ride that involves spinning around. </p> <p><strong> 8</strong> Don't take a heavy bag, just a bum bag or mini rucksack. </p> <p><strong> 9</strong> If nerves get the better of you, don't shut your eyes but try counting out loud or repeating the same sentence until the ordeal is over. </p> <p><strong> 10 </strong> When going on a wet ride, keep your handbag shut.</p>",

But even as we approached the 2,000-acre site just outside Salou on the Costa Daurada I could see the tracks of several rides soaring into the sky and realised this was no wimp's scene. This was the real thing: towering heights, dizzying speeds and death-defying drops. The park is divided into five \"worlds\": the Mediterranean, the Far West, Polynesia, Mexico and China, with appropriately themed rides, shops, games and restaurants. My favourite was China, home to the dreaded Dragon Khan, the only rollercoaster in the world with eight loops. This ride even looks scary, with its tangled mass of red metal showing more twists and turns than an episode of Sunset Beach. It leaves your heart in your mouth and your stomach doing somersaults. It begins with a steep nerve-wracking climb up a diagonal track. Then just as you're wondering whether you should have written your will, you're off - a mind-boggling drop followed by a series of angled twists where you feel not just that you will fall out of your seat as you do on most rides, but that the 32-seater car will leave the track altogether. It is this fear and the sensation of being whizzed upside down a staggering eight times and turned on your side that pumps the adrenalin round your body. The big new attraction at Port Aventura that opened in May this year is the \u00a316m Sea Odyssey, which claims to be the world's most technologically-advanced underwater simulator. The concept is that guests are taken on a deep-sea voyage by a research scientist and a talking dolphin to search for and rescue a trapped vessel from a dormant volcano. The effects are achieved by a mixture of a giant screen with high resolution images and moving seats that pitch and shake as you \"travel\" through the ocean encountering various hazards and adventures on route. The experience of being sprayed with water as you battle with sea beasts, dodge the baddies and rescue stranded divers adds to the authenticity. There really is plenty for everyone at Port Aventura. There are more than 90 rides ranging from those for the very small to the older and more daring. We also managed the Stampida, an effectively rackety wooden roller coaster in which two cars race against each other. The water rides are well worth a try although if you start your day with one, as we did, you might be better off not laughingly waving aside the offer of a waterproof coat: the Tutuki Splash, for example, should be renamed the Tutuki Soak. Wet through but wised up, we then saved the Grand Canyon Rapids and the Silver River Flume until last. Getting splashed can, however, be quite refreshing in the Spanish sun. Of course, there were queues, the bane of every theme park visitor's life, but they were not too bad on the day we went. The longest wait was only 25 minutes - nothing for someone like me who once queued for two hours for a 30-second thrill. For those who don't like being whizzed around all day, there's a wide variety of shops, game stalls and restaurants, both themed and fast food, plus 100 daily shows. We watched two: Fort Frenzee in the Far West section, which would be particularly good for smaller children with its cowboys and cowgirls, horses, fireworks and gunfights, and the Maori dancers in Polynesia - though sit well back unless you want to be roped in for embarrassing audience participation.

Anna's top 10 tips 1 Find out in advance where the camera is that's going to capture you at the scariest point. That way, you can prepare a cheeky grin or cool pout. 2 Get a map and plan the day ahead, especially if you are part of a large group - there's nothing worse than arguments over what ride to go on next. 3 Work your way up to the bigger rides. If you go on them first, all the rest will seem too tame in comparison. 4 Rides that attract long queues are more accessible during big parades. Queues are shorter in Spain at lunchtime. 5 Don't wear heels. They're uncomfortable, and you may have to remove them in front of everyone so the park stewards can check your height. 6 Word games can take your mind off long queues and pre-ride nerves. 7 Don't eat a huge meal, double scoop ice cream, can of cola or candy floss just before you go on a ride that involves spinning around. 8 Don't take a heavy bag, just a bum bag or mini rucksack. 9 If nerves get the better of you, don't shut your eyes but try counting out loud or repeating the same sentence until the ordeal is over. 10 When going on a wet ride, keep your handbag shut.",

T'ai chi, Jacuzzi, acupressure, calligraphy expert, kite maker, massage. A waiting, beaming crew. But how to get on board? </p> <p>She was several hundred yards away, across the muddy shore, and there were several narrow planks to negotiate. It did not quite compare with the gangway of QE2. In abject terror, I held my breath and my wife. The other Senior Saga Somnambulists, a chain gang of 49 souls, were wobbling across the planks; jolly and joking. What it is about the British? Why are they so incredibly stoic? Talk about gallows humour. Dunkirk came to mind. </p> <p>Once onboard, all the survivors relaxed, chatted. Feeling a sense of achievement. We nibbled, drank and started to coalesce. And there was that wonderful complex smell of Chinese food wafting up from the kitchens. Ah! The food! The food! It was continuously spectacular, even better than my local in north London. </p> <p>We were moving. We were off up the Yangtze, the Chang Jiang, heading for the fabled Three Gorges, meandering the heartland of China. </p> <p>Dapper, bearded Mike from Nottingham informed us that the river was 6,300km long, from the Tibetan plateau to the East China Sea. </p> <p>Later, when I entered the Dynasty Lounge, the truth dawned. An ominous gong reverberated in my bones. All my travelling companions were over the hill. Up until now, I had kidded myself that I had been slowly negotiating the early foothills of middle age. \"Erica! How did I get to be 73?\" I went upstairs, resigned to my fate and joined the other inmates on deck. Renee from Harrow on the Hill bee-lined for us. She was well into the hinterland of 70 years. She was urbane, elegant and sophisticated; and still quite sexy. There was still hope for us all. She had been everywhere. </p> <p>\"My husband died 10 years ago. I must have travelled 30 countries since then.\" What energy. What expense. </p> <p>Renee was not unique. This travelling seemed to be an occupation, the method of survival for many of the unattached people on board. Joan was another widow. She was once a mathematician, but now she was an inveterate traveller. Ever since she lost her husband at an impossibly early age, she hadn't been able to settle at home. \"I've been away four times already this year. It's become a sort of obsession.\" </p> <p>I looked out of the window. The misty landscape slowly passed like an intangible dream. The Victoria Pearl was a bit like life. You hardly knew you were moving but suddenly you found yourself at a new destination. Was I the only one wondering if the old man with his scythe would hobble up the gangplank come next stop? </p> <p>The Three Gorges. The gentle lush green mountains like so many soft sweet breasts loomed up in the mist, undulating into the far distance, at once therapeutic, making me feel more serene than I had ever felt since hitting three score and 10. </p> <p>\"Look!\" Mr Romford Essex waxed elegiac for Mrs Romford Essex. \"Look! Just like a Chinese painting.\" </p> <p>Indeed. Painters had been trying to recapture this magic for over 1,000 years. </p> <p>Dapper Michael with the incurable energy and enthusiasm of a schoolboy didn't actually have time to admire the scene. He was running from one end of the ship to another, dashing up and down the decks, clicking away with his camera like the end of the world. Before the end of the journey he would use up 36 reels of film. </p> <p>Michael had had done his homework; seemed to know more about China and the Chinese than anyone else on board. \"Thirteen cities will disappear with the flooding, 140 towns, 1,352 villages. All this will disappear when the great dam is completed in 2009.\" He went on clicking. </p> <p>Going ashore, we all were excited as schoolkids as we zoomed upward by cable car to the top of Zhongshan Lu and looked back down at the Yangtze. She had been free and unfettered for 5,000 years. She had witnessed everything, all the years of Chinese history from the Xia dynasty 2,000 years before Christ to the long march of Mao, and the terrible Cultural Revolution. And now the greatest revolution was about to unfold. </p> <p>The word was \"reform\". A palatable euphemism for the blatant capitalism that was taking place all over this vast land. You wait! In 30 years or so, this mind-blowing country would become the greatest nation on earth. But we, the present passengers of Victoria Pearl, would not be around. We would have long since embarked on SS Styx. </p> <p>It was happy hour: 30% off all drinks in the Yangtze Bar. Later, I went up on deck, sought a quiet corner to re-read my Arthur Waley translation of Li Bai. The moon was shivering on the surface of the Long River. More than 1,000 years ago Li Bai wrote: \"Drinking alone, with no friend near, raising my cup, I beckon the bright moon. My shadow included, we're a party of three.\" </p> <p>Li Bai could match Dylan Thomas when it came to words and drink. In his cups he tried to embrace his beloved moon in the river. And drowned. It was ever thus. </p> <p>All revelry had died on the lower decks. Sleep cocooned the entire ship. I peeped around corridors, hoping to spy at least one superannuated Lothario tapping on the cabin door of an expectant peripatetic widow. Sadly, no throaty voice whispered back. National Health dentures were all safely submerged in tumblers of bottled water in the bathrooms. There would be no orgasmic shrieks from Saga Sirens tonight. </p> <p>Middle England was deep in endlessness. Like Li Bai, I also turned in. But I embraced my sleeping wife and not the Dragon River. </p> <p>Next morning, wild monkeys ambled down from the heights to gape at us gapers. The balmy breezes of the Gorge caused the earlier humidity to vanish. The atmosphere was pure golden wine. </p> <p>The world of the ship was serene, calm, perfect. But the world ashore, in China, was mind-blowing. Impressions kept coming thick and fast. You needed a holiday from this holiday. </p> <p>We arrived at Fengdu. The Ghost City. In the temple horrendous stone ghost figures smashed each other, and ate stone babies. Sinister Tao monks grabbed yuan in exchange for a stick of incense. It was Madame Tussauds on Walpurgis Eve. </p> <p>Our young guide possessed a nice sense of humour; she didn't bombard us with dreary statistics, the expected rice yield for the next five years. But rather she informed us about the lives, dreams, and problems of the local people. Fengdu town was an endless torrent of living people. Dogs, lizards, frogs and pheasants in cages, waiting to be poked and devoured. In two years, all this street life would disappear, drowned by the waters of the Yangtze. That park, the kids at their games. The toothless old men who were still too young to qualify for Saga. I looked up to where the new town was being constructed on top of the mountain above and felt sick. </p> <p>I was amazed at the fortitude of some of the less-mobile travellers among us. Anne and Bob, despite being disabled, managed most of the arduous journeys with incredible humour. Sometimes, they struggled on the arm of a member of the crew, and sometimes they went up and down all the mountains carried in Sedan chairs. </p> <p>\"Having a good time?\" </p> <p>\"Wonderful,\" they both shouted back. They were so brave and so life affirming. Their praise for the staff was absolute. \"Marvellous. So caring.\" No brochure could claim more. Bob and Anne never moaned once. They will remain in my memory. Another shore trip was to witness the great dam under construction. More than 40,000 construction workers; busy, tireless men and women ants, massed on a mound; the largest construction site on earth. Their mission? To build a new China. To seek a glorious future. And in the process to eliminate the Three Gorges, one of the most beautiful sights on the planet. I could hear Kurt Vonnegut sighing. \"So it goes.\" </p> <p>It took three and a half hours to drive to the Yellow Mountains. When we arrived, Jimmy Rea from Glasgow produced his bagpipes and began to coax it to full croak. An astonished crowd of Chinese and Japanese tourists stood around, excited like five year olds as he led us upwards, playing Scotland the Brave. The path was gentle, but there was an awful lot of heavy breathing. And when we reached the summit, one of our three ladies from Galashiels tripped over the edge. It was a mile down. We all died, until she emerged bruised and smiling. A clump of bamboo sticks broke her fall, stopped her from becoming haggis. </p> <p>Back in the coach. Our local guide announced that he would like to sing us a song. People groaned, but this did not stop him immediately plunging into his awful aria: \"Edelweiss. Edelweiss. Everyone morning you greet me . . .\" We clapped like mad when he finished. </p> <p>On the long way back, all I can focus upon was the wonderful, bountiful dinner waiting for us. </p> <p>When we finally clambered off the coach our guide told us how happy he had been to serve us, while his narrowing eyes clocked up the yuan that was pressed into his hand. Total ineptitude sometimes pays. Come to think of it, almost all the local guides were abysmal. But there were two exceptions, and both of these were young women. </p> <p>Suddenly, like life, time quickened. Just as you settled in, you have to settle out. An aura pervaded the ship, telling us that this Saga was all over. The river opened out and we could barely see its banks. But factories in the foggy distance belched fire, and everywhere people were hurrying, scurrying, building. Gargantuan container ships loomed and the Yangtze had lost its close embrace. Its foghorns moaned, warning that Shanghai was fast coming towards us. It was all over. It was time for us to go. </p> <p>I looked back for the last time at the long river. This truly was a Saga. More than 500m people were sustained by its endless journey. This river was the very lifeblood of this impossible and incredible land. It linked all the ages; the long history of China. But for me, it now sang a threnody. China was looking forward and was reinventing herself. </p> <p>In 1956, Mao astonished the world by swimming across this Yangtze. Shortly after, he wrote a poem called Swimming: \"Great plans are afoot . . . To hold back Wushan's clouds and rain. Till a smooth lake rises in the narrow gorges. The mountain God dess, if she is still there, will marvel at a world so changed.\" </p> <p>But 1,000 years ago, Li Bai, that other poet, wrote: \"Looking at the old river,/ From the opposite banks of a yellow ribbon/Like reading an ancient scroll./Pictographs of man's flailing/Against the eddies of oft-told histories.\" </p> <p>Between these two visions, China is delicately balanced. </p> <p>As we got off Victoria Pearl, Sonia from Cardiff and her breathless husband followed behind. \"Did you enjoy yourself?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Immensely,\" she replied. \"But I am a little disappointed. I thought Saga meant Sex and Games for the Aged. All I got were the games.\"</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>The 10-night Yangtze to the Yellow Sea holiday with Victoria Cruises from <a href=\"http://www.saga.co.uk\">Saga Holidays Ltd</a>, Freepost, FO49, Sandgate, Kent CT20 3SE (0800 056 5880) costs from \u00a31,349 per person, including flights and insurance, 10 breakfasts, six lunches and 10 dinners.

Dapper, bearded Mike from Nottingham informed us that the river was 6,300km long, from the Tibetan plateau to the East China Sea. Later, when I entered the Dynasty Lounge, the truth dawned. An ominous gong reverberated in my bones. All my travelling companions were over the hill. Up until now, I had kidded myself that I had been slowly negotiating the early foothills of middle age. \"Erica! How did I get to be 73?\" I went upstairs, resigned to my fate and joined the other inmates on deck. Renee from Harrow on the Hill bee-lined for us. She was well into the hinterland of 70 years. She was urbane, elegant and sophisticated; and still quite sexy. There was still hope for us all. She had been everywhere. \"My husband died 10 years ago. I must have travelled 30 countries since then.\" What energy. What expense. Renee was not unique. This travelling seemed to be an occupation, the method of survival for many of the unattached people on board. Joan was another widow. She was once a mathematician, but now she was an inveterate traveller. Ever since she lost her husband at an impossibly early age, she hadn't been able to settle at home. \"I've been away four times already this year. It's become a sort of obsession.\" I looked out of the window. The misty landscape slowly passed like an intangible dream. The Victoria Pearl was a bit like life. You hardly knew you were moving but suddenly you found yourself at a new destination. Was I the only one wondering if the old man with his scythe would hobble up the gangplank come next stop? The Three Gorges. The gentle lush green mountains like so many soft sweet breasts loomed up in the mist, undulating into the far distance, at once therapeutic, making me feel more serene than I had ever felt since hitting three score and 10. \"Look!\" Mr Romford Essex waxed elegiac for Mrs Romford Essex. \"Look! Just like a Chinese painting.\" Indeed. Painters had been trying to recapture this magic for over 1,000 years. Dapper Michael with the incurable energy and enthusiasm of a schoolboy didn't actually have time to admire the scene. He was running from one end of the ship to another, dashing up and down the decks, clicking away with his camera like the end of the world. Before the end of the journey he would use up 36 reels of film. Michael had had done his homework; seemed to know more about China and the Chinese than anyone else on board. \"Thirteen cities will disappear with the flooding, 140 towns, 1,352 villages. All this will disappear when the great dam is completed in 2009.\" He went on clicking. Going ashore, we all were excited as schoolkids as we zoomed upward by cable car to the top of Zhongshan Lu and looked back down at the Yangtze. She had been free and unfettered for 5,000 years. She had witnessed everything, all the years of Chinese history from the Xia dynasty 2,000 years before Christ to the long march of Mao, and the terrible Cultural Revolution. And now the greatest revolution was about to unfold. The word was \"reform\". A palatable euphemism for the blatant capitalism that was taking place all over this vast land. You wait! In 30 years or so, this mind-blowing country would become the greatest nation on earth. But we, the present passengers of Victoria Pearl, would not be around. We would have long since embarked on SS Styx. It was happy hour: 30% off all drinks in the Yangtze Bar. Later, I went up on deck, sought a quiet corner to re-read my Arthur Waley translation of Li Bai. The moon was shivering on the surface of the Long River. More than 1,000 years ago Li Bai wrote: \"Drinking alone, with no friend near, raising my cup, I beckon the bright moon. My shadow included, we're a party of three.\" Li Bai could match Dylan Thomas when it came to words and drink. In his cups he tried to embrace his beloved moon in the river. And drowned. It was ever thus. All revelry had died on the lower decks. Sleep cocooned the entire ship. I peeped around corridors, hoping to spy at least one superannuated Lothario tapping on the cabin door of an expectant peripatetic widow. Sadly, no throaty voice whispered back. National Health dentures were all safely submerged in tumblers of bottled water in the bathrooms. There would be no orgasmic shrieks from Saga Sirens tonight. Middle England was deep in endlessness. Like Li Bai, I also turned in. But I embraced my sleeping wife and not the Dragon River. Next morning, wild monkeys ambled down from the heights to gape at us gapers. The balmy breezes of the Gorge caused the earlier humidity to vanish. The atmosphere was pure golden wine. The world of the ship was serene, calm, perfect. But the world ashore, in China, was mind-blowing. Impressions kept coming thick and fast. You needed a holiday from this holiday. We arrived at Fengdu. The Ghost City. In the temple horrendous stone ghost figures smashed each other, and ate stone babies. Sinister Tao monks grabbed yuan in exchange for a stick of incense. It was Madame Tussauds on Walpurgis Eve. Our young guide possessed a nice sense of humour; she didn't bombard us with dreary statistics, the expected rice yield for the next five years. But rather she informed us about the lives, dreams, and problems of the local people. Fengdu town was an endless torrent of living people. Dogs, lizards, frogs and pheasants in cages, waiting to be poked and devoured. In two years, all this street life would disappear, drowned by the waters of the Yangtze. That park, the kids at their games. The toothless old men who were still too young to qualify for Saga. I looked up to where the new town was being constructed on top of the mountain above and felt sick. I was amazed at the fortitude of some of the less-mobile travellers among us. Anne and Bob, despite being disabled, managed most of the arduous journeys with incredible humour. Sometimes, they struggled on the arm of a member of the crew, and sometimes they went up and down all the mountains carried in Sedan chairs. \"Having a good time?\" \"Wonderful,\" they both shouted back. They were so brave and so life affirming. Their praise for the staff was absolute. \"Marvellous. So caring.\" No brochure could claim more. Bob and Anne never moaned once. They will remain in my memory. Another shore trip was to witness the great dam under construction. More than 40,000 construction workers; busy, tireless men and women ants, massed on a mound; the largest construction site on earth. Their mission? To build a new China. To seek a glorious future. And in the process to eliminate the Three Gorges, one of the most beautiful sights on the planet. I could hear Kurt Vonnegut sighing. \"So it goes.\" It took three and a half hours to drive to the Yellow Mountains. When we arrived, Jimmy Rea from Glasgow produced his bagpipes and began to coax it to full croak. An astonished crowd of Chinese and Japanese tourists stood around, excited like five year olds as he led us upwards, playing Scotland the Brave. The path was gentle, but there was an awful lot of heavy breathing. And when we reached the summit, one of our three ladies from Galashiels tripped over the edge. It was a mile down. We all died, until she emerged bruised and smiling. A clump of bamboo sticks broke her fall, stopped her from becoming haggis. Back in the coach. Our local guide announced that he would like to sing us a song. People groaned, but this did not stop him immediately plunging into his awful aria: \"Edelweiss. Edelweiss. Everyone morning you greet me . . .\" We clapped like mad when he finished. On the long way back, all I can focus upon was the wonderful, bountiful dinner waiting for us. When we finally clambered off the coach our guide told us how happy he had been to serve us, while his narrowing eyes clocked up the yuan that was pressed into his hand. Total ineptitude sometimes pays. Come to think of it, almost all the local guides were abysmal. But there were two exceptions, and both of these were young women. Suddenly, like life, time quickened. Just as you settled in, you have to settle out. An aura pervaded the ship, telling us that this Saga was all over. The river opened out and we could barely see its banks. But factories in the foggy distance belched fire, and everywhere people were hurrying, scurrying, building. Gargantuan container ships loomed and the Yangtze had lost its close embrace. Its foghorns moaned, warning that Shanghai was fast coming towards us. It was all over. It was time for us to go. I looked back for the last time at the long river. This truly was a Saga. More than 500m people were sustained by its endless journey. This river was the very lifeblood of this impossible and incredible land. It linked all the ages; the long history of China. But for me, it now sang a threnody. China was looking forward and was reinventing herself. In 1956, Mao astonished the world by swimming across this Yangtze. Shortly after, he wrote a poem called Swimming: \"Great plans are afoot . . . To hold back Wushan's clouds and rain. Till a smooth lake rises in the narrow gorges. The mountain God dess, if she is still there, will marvel at a world so changed.\" But 1,000 years ago, Li Bai, that other poet, wrote: \"Looking at the old river,/ From the opposite banks of a yellow ribbon/Like reading an ancient scroll./Pictographs of man's flailing/Against the eddies of oft-told histories.\" Between these two visions, China is delicately balanced. As we got off Victoria Pearl, Sonia from Cardiff and her breathless husband followed behind. \"Did you enjoy yourself?\" I asked. \"Immensely,\" she replied. \"But I am a little disappointed. I thought Saga meant Sex and Games for the Aged. All I got were the games.\" The practicals The 10-night Yangtze to the Yellow Sea holiday with Victoria Cruises from Saga Holidays Ltd, Freepost, FO49, Sandgate, Kent CT20 3SE (0800 056 5880) costs from \u00a31,349 per person, including flights and insurance, 10 breakfasts, six lunches and 10 dinners.

      "bodyText": "In a contest that seems stranger than fiction, followers of the Falun Gong sect persisted in defying the Chinese government on the eve of today's anniversary of the ban on the movement. Sect members appeared in Tiananmen Square yesterday for the fourth day this week, unfurling banners and trying to practise ritual meditation in spite of a strong police presence. The mostly middle-aged followers, some of whom called out \"Falun Gong is good\", were shoved into police vans and driven away, while a few onlookers expressed sympathy for them. Chinese officials claimed to have won \"a major victory\" but admitted in the same breath that the drive to eradicate the movement remains \"a long-term and complex struggle\". The full weight of the state and Communist party apparatus has been brought to bear on the loosely organised movement of ordinary citizens, who are mostly inarticulate and have no apparent political aim. Beijing's propaganda continues to train its heavy guns on the shadowy figure of the group's founder, Li Hongzhi, who issues largely incoherent messages on the internet from his refuge in the US; Mr Li now claims that ban issued on July 22 last year was predicted by the 16th-century French astrologer Nostradamus. Mr Li, who is not known for modesty, recently wrote a poem titled \"The knowing heart\" to rally the spirits of his followers, part of which read: \"With teacher [Mr Li] at the helm,the Fa [Law] saves all beings; one sail is hoisted, 100 million sails follow.\" The poem ended by predicting a \"day of consummation\" when Mr Li would reveal a great truth which \"will leave the world in amazement\". Falun Gong followers claim that thousands of them have been rounded up in the past year, imprisoned, and forced to pay fines if they refuse to recant. Up to 25 are alleged to have died in custody - a charge denied by Beijing. \"This is a living hell,\" guards told a supporter in a detention centre in Shandong province, according to the movement's website. \"Nobody would care if we beat you to death.\" Beijing says that Mr Li forbids his followers from seeking medical help, leading to nearly 1,400 deaths. It has published the last testament of a Communist party member won over by the sect, who repented and denounced Mr Li as he lay dying of cancer. The allegations of both sides are impossible to verify, but police tactics against the demonstrators have been on display in Tiananmen Square this week: they have ranged from quiet persuasion to brute force, with some demonstrators kicked and punched or dragged along the ground. There appears to be a growing sense of frustration that the sect refuses to go away. Many Chinese regard the sect and Mr Li with scepticism, but believe they are harmless. There is a widespread belief that it might have been ignored if it had not staged a mass protest in Beijing in April last year outside the compound where senior leaders work.

In fact, Tony has undergone a feminisation: his hair has turned fluffy, his voice has softened, his expression is girly, his hands move as gracefully as a geisha's.

Back in 1971, he triggered a major fashion moment that saw grown men strutting pigeon-like down the street in loverman Afros, sharp flares and loud overcoats, with that soundtrack playing in their heads. And when Isaac Hayes asked \"Who is the man...?\" every last one of them thought he knew the answer.</p> <p>\"Shaft appealed to everyone - every man wanted to be the sex machine for all the chicks,\" says costume designer Ruth Carter, the woman charged with doing the impossible: trying to update and up the ante on the coolest contemporary screen dude for the return of Shaft, starring Samuel L Jackson as Richard Roundtree's nephew.</p> <p>The original Shaft was right on the money style-wise. Back then, men's fashion was still pretty conservative, until Shaft arrived looking sharp as a knife. But will he strike the right note 30 years on? \"Shaft 2000 is about dressing up and looking good,\" says Carter, so out go the flares, gargantuan lapels and long collars, and in come cashmere turtlenecks and sumptuous simplicity. And that all-important coat.</p> <p>\"The first Shaft was all about the coat,\" explains Carter, referring to Roundtree's long, brown, belted, leather jacket, which was made by the director Gordon Parks's tailor, and spawned a host of imitators. This time, it is a black leather number by Giorgio Armani - very long, very simple, very streamlined. </p> <p>Lucky old Giorgio. There are worse models to hang your designs on than the velvety Samuel L-J. But will our strapping hero have the same fashion clout in 2000 as he did in 1971? So far, the jury is out. \"It's a great coat,\" admits Hal Rubenstein, of America's celebrity fashion bible InStyle, \"but we saw the longer-length leather coat in The Matrix last year, and it didn't catch on. You can't run for a bus in a coat that length. In the end, pragmatism will always win out.\"</p> <p>And there's the rub: we may admire a snappy dresser with an original look, but we are only going to copy them if it is practical. \"You could believe in Shaft,\" says Carter. \"That's what was hot - the fact that he was a 'real' person made all the difference, that's what made people want to buy into it.\"</p> <p>Which presumably is why Gladiator, while an enormous box-office smash, will never inspire a great fashion following, despite shoe designer Cole Haan's rather feeble attempt to get in on the act by advertising Roman sandals. Let's face it, if Gladiator starts any trends at all, it'll be in the stripogram industry.</p> <p>Some looks, however, are instant hits. In the 70s, it was Annie Hall. In the mid 90s, every girl was doing the Pulp Fiction look, wearing Uma Thurman's white, fitted Agnes b shirt and black bootcut trousers. And Demi Moore's black strappy Thierry Mugler evening dress from Indecent Proposal was so simple and sexy that it is still being copied now.</p> <p>Of course, some trends are just easier to follow than others. Audrey Hepburn's wide blonde streaks were de rigueur for 60s chicks after Breakfast At Tiffany's (and again after Mrs Robinson in The Graduate). And which lad didn't shave his head after Trainspotting? Anything that's quick and easy to do is likely to take off: Uma's Chanel Vamp nail varnish in Pulp Fiction set off a fashion frenzy, as did Alicia Silverstone's pale blue Hard Candy polish after she wore it in Clueless (although the trend lasted about as long as the lingo). </p> <p>Sunglasses are another common cinema-inspired craze. Tom Cruise's Ray-ban Wayfarers from Risky Business and Aviators from Top Gun were sooo popular in the 80s, as were Elvis shades after True Romance.</p> <p>The basic rule is that only realistic, contemporary, wearable looks catch on from movies. Take the 50s-fest The Talented Mr Ripley, which has only inspired everyone to go to Rome on holiday: we loved the film, we loved the look, but no one sane wants to wear something so retro it's virtually period costume (only mad old ladies and rockabillies are doing the 50s look right now).</p> <p>However, try telling that to staff at J Peterman, a chain of stores in the States specialising in frankly hilarious \"reproduction vintage apparel inspired by the movies\". They do ranges from Titanic, The Avengers and LA Confidential. Surely they haven't really caught on? </p> <p>\"Someone came in and spent $8,000 buying all of [Titanic heroine] Rose's outfits - dresses, hats, shoes everything - for an Easter Sunday outfit,\" reports a relentlessly cheerful sales assistant at the Grand Central Station store. But isn't the Titanic look, rather, um, dated? </p> <p>\"You'd be surprised. It's a very timeless look, it's not faddish, it's not trendy-trendy.\" It certainly isn't. Yet not even the movie's more downbeat storylines can deter Maison Peterman.</p> <p>\"You know when Rose is having lunch and her fiance slaps her face and turns over the table?\" continues the assistant excitedly. \"We've got that dress! It's cream with a gold collar and rhinestone embroidery.\" And there's more: the dress that Rose wears while considering whether to commit suicide by throwing herself overboard has been lovingly reproduced as \"an ideal wedding dress\".</p> <p>J Peterman not only breaks all laws of taste, decency and credulity, it pretty much breaks all the rules in the handbook of flogging film-inspired fashion. The store is a roaring success.</p> <p>\"You can never predict which fashions are going to catch on after films,\" says Bloomingdale's fashion director Kal Ruttenstein, and he should know. As far back as 1967, the store created one of its first in-store boutiques for Bonnie &amp; Clyde fashions: berets, long skirts, elongated jumpers. Customers were fighting in the aisles (albeit not with machine guns).</p> <p>Promotions followed, with varying success, for Chariots Of Fire (boater hats, red striped ties and blazers, and white summer clothes), Les Liaisons Dangereuses (lingerie with Malkovich-style frilly shirts as ladies' nightgowns) and Evita. Studios now approach the store to do fashion tie-ins.</p> <p>It helps, of course, if the star is pushing the look off-screen. When Madonna was in Evita she took to wearing 40s-style Prada suits off-duty. This begs the question which comes first, the film or the trend? \"Usually it's the film,\" says Ruth Carter, \"but by the time the film is released two years later, the fashion designers have picked up on it.\"</p> <p>The Evita boutique was a huge success, but there is really no guessing what will sell. Six hundred yellow trenchcoats flew out of the store after Warren Beatty's starring role in Dick Tracy.</p> <p>So is Shaft 2000 heading for a fashion moment? Will it be wall-to-wall streamlined leather overcoats on the streets of London and Manhattan this autumn? So far it's looking pretty good, but the difference is that the 1971 Shaft look was fresh. The latest look is not particularly directional - we've seen turtlenecks and leather jackets before, after all. \"Sam looks terrific,\" says Hal Rubenstein, \"but the clothes just aren't that revolutionary.\"</p> <p>This time, though, Shaft is packing a powerful new weapon - all that Armani hype. The Shaft theme tune played at Giorgio's January menswear show, and he invited Samuel L Jackson up onto the catwalk, simpering \"you provide the attitude, I'll provide the wardrobe\".</p> <p>Will the old film and fashion alchemy work again? Shaft's badass jacket has already hit Armani's US stores. The cost is a cool $3,500.

      "body": "<p>It is house-cleaning time in Tinseltown, and all that kicking and screaming you hear is the sound of pampered stars being rudely ejected from their comfy, all-expenses-paid digs on the studio lots. The Hollywood suits are tightening their belts and digging in their heels. The day of the vanity production deal may be over. </p> <p>Perhaps the best way to explain the term \"vanity deal\" is to list a few movies that derive from these sweetheart arrangements between studios and stars. A pattern will emerge, just you wait and see: The Scarlet Letter, Breakfast Of Champions, Crazy In Alabama, The Postman, any recent Barbra Streisand movie you might care to mention, Battlefield Earth, That Thing You Do, I Dreamed Of Africa, Little Man Tate and Nell, The Deep End Of The Ocean and Cop Land. Those names might make you think that vanity deal is a synonym for \"shit movie\", and on the available evidence, that's not far from the truth, but usually it means the star is either producing or directing, and is only being permitted to do so because the studio wants to keep them sweet for the next real movie they want to make with them. </p> <p>A vanity deal is often a reward for egocentric actors with ideas above their station and IQs smaller than their waistlines who've racked up a couple of sizeable hits. The perks are straightforward enough. The studio will give you a certain amount of money to establish your own production company in offices. Your staff of assistants, manicurists, personal chefs, leg-waxers, brothers-in-law, script readers and such members of your retinue that you choose to employ will base themselves here and essentially be paid by the studio. Your benefactor will probably also cough up development funds and money for script acquisitions. The purpose is to make stars feel in charge of the creative side of the production.</p> <p>The early days are exhilarating enough: choosing the wallpaper, the office furniture, the couches, the carpets and so on (\"send the bill to Fox/Sony/Paramount/Universal\"). Then things get uglier, mainly because the movie has to be made (well, it doesn't, as we shall see, but let's assume the star is actually interested in getting it made). All too often the actor, having finally achieved the control he or she has been craving since their first kindergarten Nativity play, finds out what producing really involves, how many people you have to scream and shout at, how little the studio really cares about your Mickey-Mouse, rinky-dink personal movie, and starts to yearn for the security of those zillion-dollar action movies that made them rich and which as creative artists they affect to despise. </p> <p>Which brings us neatly back to that list of movies. This is the stuff the overindulged stars really wanted to get involved with. Often they approved the writer, sought out the director - malleable yes-men are preferred - and had a hand in the casting. The result of giving actors their heads is plain to see. Over here we have the wan, animal-loving antics of Ms Kim Basinger, cuddling lions and making like Joy Adamson redux as the slick, blonde mistress of an African farm in the slack, bland I Dreamed Of Africa. I bet she never dreamed it would vanish from the nation's screens in a fortnight.</p> <p>Over there we can spy the wreckage of Demi Moore's The Scarlet Letter (to say nothing of Nathaniel Hawthorne fighting his way out of his grave to get his hands on Demi) and the almost simultaneously released Striptease. Both of these were worked up by Demi's own production company and apparently owed their existence to Moore's desire to showcase her recent breast-augmentation. The Scarlet Letter, to which critics awarded a scarlet D-minus, contained an unarousing bathtub sex scene not found in the novel. The critical response to Striptease was \"put 'em away, love\". There is a school of thought that says Demi Moore's entire career is little more than one of Bruce Willis's many vanity projects. Universal has since cancelled its deal with Moore's Moving Pictures Company, most likely because of Moore's vertiginous loss of marque-value. </p> <p>Chances are, if the star also directed, it's a vanity project. Here one can cite the directorial oeuvre of Jodie Foster - Little Man Tate, Home For The Holidays - which would very likely not have come into being without the success of The Silence Of The Lambs. Without Clarice Starling there would be no Egg Pictures, the chintzy new-age name of Jodie's production company. Actors often do a little direction as a vacation from huge studio pictures, and some fare OK. That Thing You Do was modest and sweet enough, Robert De Niro's A Bronx Tale was rather good, and Costner's saccharine Dances With Wolves made money, won Oscars and kept audiences happy. Hanks and De Niro have backed off, apparently satisfied that they've proved something to themselves, but Costner, as we know, wasn't happy with just one shot. Having won the Best Director Academy Award for Wolves (against Scorsese for GoodFellas, a sick joke), he had to come back for more. The result, The Postman, is a vanity project writ so large that a million men with brooms were required to sweep up the debris. Kevin directed, starred in and even sang over the final credits with Jennifer Warnes. The result was box-office poison and it and Costner quickly descended to the level of national laughing-stock. </p> <p>Now Tinseltown has had enough. A backlash against sweeteners for stars has been building up ever since 1995, when Columbia/TriStar chairman Mark Canton gave the 18-year-old Alicia Silverstone and her First Kiss production company a $10 million development deal after the success of Clueless. After two years Silverstone had managed, with great difficulty, to get only one movie into cinema, the critically savaged commercial flop Excess Baggage, whose title well describes the way the studios now perceive these deals. Silverstone found out her number was up when Columbia left her name off a list of production deals submitted to Variety. At around the same time, others were being cancelled, including Elle McPherson's office at Miramax, where she was prepping some witless documentary about women's lingerie called Bend Me, Shape Me, and Jason Alexander, who had been developing a white supremacist project for 20th Century Fox. </p> <p>In the new penny-pinching studios, they're off-loading everyone but the most dependable money earners. And access to the studio trough will be regulated even for the biggest players, as Sean Penn discovered when he tried to commandeer a Fox jet for The Thin Red Line promo tour (that movie, incidentally, was some producer's prestige vanity project). Last year Warner Bros closed down development deals it was backing with Tim Burton and Matthew McConaughey, and only retained proven warhorses such as Robin Williams and Sean Connery who, in the words of one studio head \"always pretty much get what they want anyway\". </p> <p>Behind the changes one can detect one of Hollywood's occasional periods of austerity, caused by the cost of making and marketing movies and lower profit margins. The last problem has mainly been caused by the insatiable demands of overpaid movie stars, whose salaries have been hyper-inflated for a decade now. It's pleasingly ironic that when the cutbacks arrive they should fall heavily on stars' hobby projects. </p> <p>Other big names on the way out are Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas, who came a cropper when Crazy In Alabama headed straight for the box-office toilet on its opening weekend. Griffith's company, Green Moon, had been bankrolled for five years by Warners. Result: one $10 million flop that took barely $600,000. Griffith and Banderas - who directed, more vanity! - were asked to vacate their offices. </p> <p>Michelle Pfeiffer also moved on after the failure of her movie The Deep End Of The Ocean, which had taken four years to put together, proved the actress lacked the golden touch her husband David E Kelley has shown on TV. \"She walked away before she was chased off the lot,\" said one Sony executive.</p> <p>Sylvester Stallone has also lost his CopLand Ventures, the last remnant of his desire to be taken seriously, and even Madonna has been denied the chance to re-up at Warners. An office that she has had on the lot since 1990 has just been shut down. \"It was a tidying-up exercise,\" said one executive. \"Her acting career seems to have reached an impasse. Hers may have been the last of the old-fashioned vanity deals. I can't see our shareholders allowing us to sign such deals again.\" </p> <p>You don't hear me moaning.</p>",

And access to the studio trough will be regulated even for the biggest players, as Sean Penn discovered when he tried to commandeer a Fox jet for The Thin Red Line promo tour (that movie, incidentally, was some producer's prestige vanity project). Last year Warner Bros closed down development deals it was backing with Tim Burton and Matthew McConaughey, and only retained proven warhorses such as Robin Williams and Sean Connery who, in the words of one studio head \"always pretty much get what they want anyway\". Behind the changes one can detect one of Hollywood's occasional periods of austerity, caused by the cost of making and marketing movies and lower profit margins. The last problem has mainly been caused by the insatiable demands of overpaid movie stars, whose salaries have been hyper-inflated for a decade now. It's pleasingly ironic that when the cutbacks arrive they should fall heavily on stars' hobby projects. Other big names on the way out are Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas, who came a cropper when Crazy In Alabama headed straight for the box-office toilet on its opening weekend. Griffith's company, Green Moon, had been bankrolled for five years by Warners. Result: one $10 million flop that took barely $600,000. Griffith and Banderas - who directed, more vanity! - were asked to vacate their offices. Michelle Pfeiffer also moved on after the failure of her movie The Deep End Of The Ocean, which had taken four years to put together, proved the actress lacked the golden touch her husband David E Kelley has shown on TV. \"She walked away before she was chased off the lot,\" said one Sony executive. Sylvester Stallone has also lost his CopLand Ventures, the last remnant of his desire to be taken seriously, and even Madonna has been denied the chance to re-up at Warners. An office that she has had on the lot since 1990 has just been shut down. \"It was a tidying-up exercise,\" said one executive. \"Her acting career seems to have reached an impasse. Hers may have been the last of the old-fashioned vanity deals. I can't see our shareholders allowing us to sign such deals again.\" You don't hear me moaning.",

      "body": "<b>Dear Mr Pears</b> <br> Have you been enjoying the summer of sport? On the credit side, sports fans have enjoyed the unexpected European Cup success of the British men's athletics team, the growing prowess of our women's modern pentathlon squad, and the enduring excellence of Lennox Lewis. On the debit side, our swimmers obtained only a modest medal haul at the European Championships, the England football team made a less-than-glorious exit from Euro 2000, and Britain has been relegated from the World Group of the Davis Cup. The England men's cricket team, meanwhile, have managed to cram Himalayan highs and subterranean lows into the space of just a few days. Does any of this matter? I am certainly not among those who believe that sport is more important than life and death. But it would be short-sighted to underestimate the part sport plays in the overall scheme of things. To borrow from CLR James, a sporting event does not reflect the age. It is the age. In a fast-changing world, sport is arguably our most potent expression of local, regional and national identity. It holds up a unique mirror for societies seeking to understand who they are and what they are; it provides a measure of a country's competitiveness and its capacity to succeed. The government wants to demonstrate that the UK is a thriving, dynamic country that can engage with the world and promote itself with confidence. Winning medals in major sports events is a high-profile way of illustrating this. That's one reason sport is climbing up the political agenda. Yours sincerely, <br> Sir Rodney Walker <br> Chairman, UK Sport <br> <br> <p><b>Dear Sir Rodney</b><br><br> Let's be honest, once England departed Euro 2000, this country (and every other one) breathed a huge sigh of relief and settled back to enjoy that festival of beautiful football. As for Wimbledon, we English seem to be divided between those who, upon watching Tim Henman make his thin-lipped and doomed assault on Centre Court, feel their hearts pump faster, and those who cringe. <br><br> The trouble with seeking national self-esteem through sporting success is twofold. First, it involves dominating other people and using sport as a metaphor for war, as opposed to treating sport like an exhilarating dance, in which, with our opponents, we create something beautiful. Second, and this is our own particular Anglo-Brit problem, there is the legacy of our imperial past. We seem to find it impossible to accept who we are and to take a relaxed place among the middle-sized nations of the world. So it's hard to wear our national self-esteem, our patriotism, in the way it should be worn - as a mask for a carnival, a persona for a party.<br><br> I and the people I mix with do not wish to derive our self-esteem from national sporting success. I don't think we even want national self-esteem. We don't want to be proud to be British. Or English. Or male or female, black or white, short or tall. No, nor ashamed, either. But relaxed and comfortable with who we are, and with each other. All sorts of people play sport all around us: young and old, graceful and hopeless. But not enough people. Let's forget national sporting success. Let's just get out there and play.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Tim Pears<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Tim</b><br><br> I am sorry and a little saddened that you find it difficult to take pride in the various manifestations of your identity. A sense of belonging is, after all, one of humanity's most basic needs.<br><br> Actually, I feel most sorry for our sportsmen and women themselves; they deserve a lot better. These days some stand to earn considerable wealth from their sport, but that doesn't mean they don't have to sacrifice a great deal to get to the top. And getting to the top means competing against the best in the world, usually by representing one's country. If sporting talent has to express itself this way, then so be it; let's not deny talented athletes our support, for they are national assets as precious as talented artists, musicians, designers and architects.<br><br> I am surprised, too, that you fail to see the connection between national sporting success and the impulse to \"get out there and play\". Of course, I accept that the behaviour which accompanies certain major sports events can be ugly. But as you yourself hint, the dividing line between carnage and carnival is remarkably thin. Sport has a unique ability to bring nations and peoples together. It is an ability worth fighting for - even when the going gets tough.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Sir Rodney Walker<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Sir Rodney</b> <br><br> You're right, the line between carnage and carnival is thin - as illustrated by the fact that we are debating in a week when one programme devoted to football on terrestrial TV was a celebration of the beautiful game's dirty bastards, as George Best called them.<br><br> George Orwell wrote that \"serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness and disregard of all the rules.\" One has to admit he had a point. The custodians of football did their best to eliminate violent play in Euro 2000, but cheating became ever more prevalent.<br><br> To return to the original question, what do we mean by sporting success? We live in an age when success for the few is the aspiration, and is rewarded with vast wealth. But the real success in sport comes when people play it. I thought the recent fad for books about being a football supporter was really odd - I spent my weekends playing on council pitches in various parts of this country and, to borrow from Albert Camus, learned all I know of life there. <br><br> Unserious sport is bound up with vitality, togetherness, joy. The trouble is that the more national triumph we have, the more we'll sit back and watch it on Sky with our couch-potato children. Meanwhile, school playing fields will continue to be sold off.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Tim Pears<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Tim</b><br><br> We may sometimes struggle to get our message across - but most people would associate the sports councils with the concept of \"sport for all\". Nothing is dearer to us than getting people to play, and seeing them remain involved for the rest of their lives.<br><br> But winning is unavoidably a part of sport. Take away the winning and the whole structure of sport falls apart. Indeed, if people play without, ultimately, trying to win, then it could be argued they are participating in an activity which is not, in fact, sport at all. True, the dirty bastards sometimes win, but the good guys don't always lose. Can't we use sport to teach ourselves - especially our children - how to win in the right way and how to lose in the right way?<br><br> Football is our highest-profile sport, and we all tend to use it as a template for the state of sport in toto. But it is not the only sport, and what happens in the football world is not a model that is slavishly followed by athletes, coaches and managers in other sports. Track and field athletes, swimmers, rowers and cyclists may all overstep the mark from time to time, but I believe those and other sports can still exhibit friendship, camaraderie and the spirit of shared experience - even in a fiercely competitive environment.<br><br> I have no doubt the Sydney Olympics will throw up its fair share of controversy. But I am equally sure they will move us and humble us as well.<br><br> Yours sincerely<br> Sir Rodney Walker<br><br> <b>Dear Sir Rodney,</b> <br><br> Now you're talking! Yes, let's use sport to teach ourselves how to win in the right way and how to lose in the right way. We need to say: \"Of course we try to win, we commit our every nerve and sinew to winning.\" Yet we also need to know that it doesn't matter whether we win or lose, that the purpose of competition is not to beat an opponent, but for opponents to fulfil each other's highest potential, as they create together an event of beauty.<br><br> You quite rightly mention games other than football, and let's take this much wider still: you and I love sport, Sir Rodney, but we also know how many children (especially girls) are put off sport at school by the nature of competitive games. I'm convinced that everyone could experience the joy that sport can give, if they were given access to enough variety to choose from. <br><br> I say, let the children practise yoga in the hall and aerobics in the gym. Let there be table tennis in the classroom and dancing on the desk tops. Give our sons and daughters Ordnance Survey maps so that they may ramble our footpaths, the veins and arteries of this island. Let's wander these green hills, run the wild coastal paths, and stride across our liberated moorlands. <br><br>Let's rollerblade all this dead concrete back to some kind of life, and climb to the tops of the trees that are left in Britain, just so we can sway in the wind.

      "bodyText": "Jack Straw has signed \"gagging orders\" to protect the role of the intelligence agencies in catching the M25 killer Kenneth Noye, one of Britain's most notorious villains. The existence of the orders is the first official confirmation of the involvement of the spying agencies in the capture of Noye. Details of the home secretary's action have been released to the Guardian under John Major's \"open government\" code - in use in advance of the freedom of information bill becoming law next year - following a request from the newspaper. Mr Straw has taken the action in advance of an appeal by Noye against his life sentence for a \"road rage\" murder in 1996. The home secretary signed two gagging orders - officially known as public interest immunity certificates - on February 2 and 8 this year. He said that the certificates were necessary in order to \"prevent real harm\" being inflicted on the confidential work of the intelligence agencies, who now have an important role in catching criminals. Noye, 53, was jailed for life for stabbing to death Stephen Cameron during an argument on the M25 in May 1996. Immediately after the murder, Noye fled abroad. It is believed that the gagging orders keep secret how the intelligence agencies helped to track down Noye by covertly eavesdropping on his mobile telephone calls. It is understood that the security service MI5, and operatives at the government communications headquarters (GCHQ) at Cheltenham, monitored Noye's calls to friends and business associates. After numerous alleged sightings over two years, this apparently enabled police officers to locate the origin of the calls and then home in on Noye's real hiding-place in Spain. Following the end of the cold war and IRA ceasefires, MI5 lobbied fiercely within Whitehall to be given other work to justify its existence. In 1996, its activities were extended to support police in the prevention and detection of serious crime. Critics argued that the obsessive secrecy surrounding MI5 would damage the open criminal justice system because, unlike the police, the organisation would seek to use gagging orders to stop its activities from being scrutinised fairly in court.",

For them, there was only one matchwinner: Alec Stewart.</p> <p>Eight days ago, Stewart was having a one-day series to forget. He was keeping well, but his captaincy was indifferent (England were awful in the first two games) and as an opening batsman, he was playing junior partner to a much younger man, Marcus Trescothick. When Stewart failed for the third time in a row, his career average slipped below 30. He has admitted that as he gets older, he is more interested in statistics. This one was not so much a stat as a scandal. Stewart realised it, and rectified it with successive scores of 79 not out, 101, 100 not out and 97: the purplest patch not just in his one-day career, but in the whole chequered history of the boys in bright blue.</p> <p> Today he was at his imperious best, adjusting to the conditions so well that he barely got a run with his two favourite strokes, the cut and the pull. Instead he was cover-driving, in that distinctive thwacking way of his, and even on-driving, to the delight of a crowd who were traditional enough to know the difference between a cow-shot and real class. It barely mattered that Trescothick and the other young pretender, Andy Flintoff, managed just one run between them. Stewart was on the field for 86.3 overs today, to go with 100 on Thursday, 96 on Tuesday, and the whole match last Saturday. And he was in the thick of the action all that time. Some of the crowd were unhappy that there wasn't a band playing at Lord's today. There was: a one-man band. </p> <p>In one-day tournaments, the team that finishes first is the team that finishes best - that hits form half-way through, and builds an unstoppable momentum. For once, that team was England. Nasser Hussain, with an awful lot of help from Stewart, became only the second England captain of recent times after Adam Hollioake to lift a three-sided trophy.</p> <p>The opposition weren't great, but you still have to do the business and England, as well as having two high-scoring openers (they could have had three if they had played Nick Knight ahead of Flintoff), were much the best bowling side in a bowlers' tournament. Today the third, fourth and fifth seamers - Mullally, Ealham and White - were less miserly than before, but that just made a reasonable game of it. And Gough and Caddick were exceptional. Mullally, rated No. 2 in the world by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, isn't even the second-best one-day bowler in this team.</p> <p>Abroad, on flat tracks, this attack will be too samey, and the tail it entails too long. But in these conditions, it was spot-on. </p> <p>For the Zimbabweans, losing the toss made the game a bridge too far. Their tour ends in defeat, but with the dignity that characterised it from day one. Buffeted by events at home and blown away in the Lord's Test, they fought back strongly and won many friends. Now they are losing two of their few real internationals, Neil Johnson and Murray Goodwin.

      "body": "<p><br><strong>Address: </strong>The Village Pub, Barnsley <br> There is a ritual to the making of a good Bloody Mary, a certain ceremonial stateliness to the ordering of ingredients, adding the dash of this and the splash of that, building up the layers of flavour, keeping a balance and harmony between them, so that, as you taste that first slug, there's the crackle of celery salt, the fruitiness of tomato juice, the round warmth of Worcestershire sauce, the slow burn of Tabasco, the dry crackle of sherry and, finally, the long fingers of alcohol reaching gently up into the brain as the vodka comes into its own. </p> <p>But horseradish? \"Would you like horseradish?\" asked the young lady behind the bar of the Village Pub. Why not, said Philomena, for whom the sacramental Bloody Mary was being prepared. So it came with horseradish, and celery salt crusted around the rim. The perfect, definitive Bloody Mary, said Philomena. Oho, I thought. Ahah. </p> <p>We - that is, Philomena, Room-for-Two Lewis, their son Ben and I - had gone to The Village Pub at the suggestion of two readers. You can find it in the languidly pretty village of Barnsley, just outside Cirencester. The appealing baldness of the name is matched by the appealing comfort of the place. Had the weather been more clement, we could have eaten in the courtyard outside. As it was, proto-Arctic conditions encouraged us to take up a table in the plain, handsome interior. </p> <p>I was right about the wider implications of the Bloody Mary rituals. The Hook Norton bitter, with which Room-for-Two and I settled the nerves, was in exquisite nick, and young Ben's lemonade was Fentimans, a superior brand. If a pub will take such pains over its Bloody Mary, beer and lemonade, you need have no fear about lunch, that's my feeling. </p> <p>The chef is a young fellow by the name of Graham Grafton, who got here by way of The Greenhouse, The Ivy, Le Caprice and Bibendum, a CV that suggests that he knows how to cook sensible food seriously, which is what you want in a pub. You may quibble with the pedigree of a dish such as smoked mackerel Ni\u00e7oise, but you couldn't, according to Room-for-Two, complain about the result. The smoked fish, he said, really benefited from the Ni\u00e7oise treatment, and the smoking actually did things for the salad, too. </p> <p>Ben and Philomena's grilled sardines were as fresh as you could wish, splendidly cooked, and some baked pepper and tomato (a bit of a Delia touch) helped flesh out the dish intelligently. I, meanwhile, had been drawn to a dish of chicken liver and black pudding hash. The job description was a bit misleading -hash, I thought, meant that everything was mashed up together. Here, the hunks of liver, the chunks of soft, French-style pudding and the fried potatoes were arranged separately around a tussock of salad. Still, each element was well-sourced and very well cooked, and the salad was dressed for the occasion. </p> <p>I didn't get quite such a kick from the duck-plums-and-noodles business with which I followed this up, largely because I am not convinced that this is the best way to serve duck. I could have done without the noodles, for one, and the slop of soya gravy.

      "bodyText": "Address: The Village Pub, Barnsley There is a ritual to the making of a good Bloody Mary, a certain ceremonial stateliness to the ordering of ingredients, adding the dash of this and the splash of that, building up the layers of flavour, keeping a balance and harmony between them, so that, as you taste that first slug, there's the crackle of celery salt, the fruitiness of tomato juice, the round warmth of Worcestershire sauce, the slow burn of Tabasco, the dry crackle of sherry and, finally, the long fingers of alcohol reaching gently up into the brain as the vodka comes into its own. But horseradish? \"Would you like horseradish?\" asked the young lady behind the bar of the Village Pub. Why not, said Philomena, for whom the sacramental Bloody Mary was being prepared. So it came with horseradish, and celery salt crusted around the rim. The perfect, definitive Bloody Mary, said Philomena. Oho, I thought. Ahah. We - that is, Philomena, Room-for-Two Lewis, their son Ben and I - had gone to The Village Pub at the suggestion of two readers. You can find it in the languidly pretty village of Barnsley, just outside Cirencester. The appealing baldness of the name is matched by the appealing comfort of the place. Had the weather been more clement, we could have eaten in the courtyard outside. As it was, proto-Arctic conditions encouraged us to take up a table in the plain, handsome interior. I was right about the wider implications of the Bloody Mary rituals. The Hook Norton bitter, with which Room-for-Two and I settled the nerves, was in exquisite nick, and young Ben's lemonade was Fentimans, a superior brand. If a pub will take such pains over its Bloody Mary, beer and lemonade, you need have no fear about lunch, that's my feeling. The chef is a young fellow by the name of Graham Grafton, who got here by way of The Greenhouse, The Ivy, Le Caprice and Bibendum, a CV that suggests that he knows how to cook sensible food seriously, which is what you want in a pub. You may quibble with the pedigree of a dish such as smoked mackerel Ni\u00e7oise, but you couldn't, according to Room-for-Two, complain about the result. The smoked fish, he said, really benefited from the Ni\u00e7oise treatment, and the smoking actually did things for the salad, too. Ben and Philomena's grilled sardines were as fresh as you could wish, splendidly cooked, and some baked pepper and tomato (a bit of a Delia touch) helped flesh out the dish intelligently. I, meanwhile, had been drawn to a dish of chicken liver and black pudding hash. The job description was a bit misleading -hash, I thought, meant that everything was mashed up together. Here, the hunks of liver, the chunks of soft, French-style pudding and the fried potatoes were arranged separately around a tussock of salad. Still, each element was well-sourced and very well cooked, and the salad was dressed for the occasion. I didn't get quite such a kick from the duck-plums-and-noodles business with which I followed this up, largely because I am not convinced that this is the best way to serve duck. I could have done without the noodles, for one, and the slop of soya gravy. The duck breast, on the other hand, was superbly rich and juicy, while the gently tart plums were on hand to discipline any sense of over-indulgence. Ben declared his steak to be the best he had ever had. I noticed that he passed on the creamed leeks, but I put that down to the natural aversion of a 15-year-old boy to all vegetables except chips (which were very good, incidentally). Room-for-Two's Moroccan beef casserole looked and tasted a hit. It was massive, black and glossy; sweet, soft and fibrous; genial and broad-shouldered, with a hint of the exotic. In short, it was very fine eating from every perspective. Philomena was just as entranced by her sea bass, which demonstrated the benefits of not mucking about with a good piece of very fresh fish, other than to cook it with precision.

I hope the evidence from other doctors will show that I showed sympathy, compassion and tender loving care to my patients.\" </p> <p>He said he was \"especially proud\" of his record at Friarage hopspital in Northallerton, North York shire, where he had saved 100% of his elderly cancer patients for at least five years. \"I loved medicine, it was my life and I was wedded to it. It was the greatest privilege,\" he said. </p> <p>He claimed the complaints against him had been orches trated by just two patients and that he had been demonised by the media. </p> <p>He was, he said, \"just an average surgeon, not good and not all bad.\" </p> <p>He admitted he had made mistakes in Canada. To hollow laughter from former patients in the gallery, he offered to take a retraining course in gynaecology in the UK. </p> <p>Once the case is over, there will be questions to answer for both the GMC, which did not take action against Mr Neale after it was informed he had been struck off in Canada, and the hospital trust in Northallerton where Mr Neale was given a \u00a3100,000 pay-off to leave after 10 years and a clean reference in spite of concerns over his competence.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Richard Neale, the gynaecologist found guilty of more than 30 charges of malpractice, was yesterday described as incompetent, arrogant and downright dishonest in hearings before the General Medical Council to decide whether he should be struck off the medical register. But after a searing indictment by the prosecuting counsel, Vivian Robinson QC, of his inadequacies and the damage he has done to women over the 14 years in the UK since losing his licence to practice in Canada in 1985, Mr Neale made a tearful plea to the tribunal, claiming he was always \"a surgeon who put his patients' best interests at heart\". He told the professional conduct committee, which will decide next week whether to strike him off after hearing from character witnesses: \"I do hope that I am not the worst surgeon there has ever been. I hope the evidence from other doctors will show that I showed sympathy, compassion and tender loving care to my patients.\" He said he was \"especially proud\" of his record at Friarage hopspital in Northallerton, North York shire, where he had saved 100% of his elderly cancer patients for at least five years. \"I loved medicine, it was my life and I was wedded to it. It was the greatest privilege,\" he said. He claimed the complaints against him had been orches trated by just two patients and that he had been demonised by the media. He was, he said, \"just an average surgeon, not good and not all bad.\" He admitted he had made mistakes in Canada. To hollow laughter from former patients in the gallery, he offered to take a retraining course in gynaecology in the UK. Once the case is over, there will be questions to answer for both the GMC, which did not take action against Mr Neale after it was informed he had been struck off in Canada, and the hospital trust in Northallerton where Mr Neale was given a \u00a3100,000 pay-off to leave after 10 years and a clean reference in spite of concerns over his competence.",

      "body": "<p>When John Clare died of a stroke on May 20 1864, aged 70, he was almost a forgotten figure. For 23 years he had been confined in the Northampton General Lunatic Asylum, which he called \"the purgatorial hell and French bastile of English liberty, where harmless people are trapped and tortured until they die\". He is now recognised as the finest and most prolific of all English rural poets, as important as his contemporaries Keats, Shelley and Byron. </p> <p>But the growing interest in Clare and increasing demand for new editions of his work have exposed a literary imprisonment almost as cruel, certainly as unusual, as the one he suffered in the \"bastile\" at Northampton. The case has united such high-profile Clare enthusiasts as Seamus Heaney, Tom Paulin and Andrew Motion, the poet laureate, in a campaign to \"free\" the poet. For, amazingly, 136 years after Clare's death, the copyright to most of his writings is still claimed as private property by a single individual. </p> <p>Professor Eric Robinson, a historian at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, has for the past 35 years claimed to own the copyright to Clare's unpublished writings. He has enforced this claim, demanding acknowledgement and often payment from anyone who wishes to publish Clare material. In the view of Tim Chilcott, the effect has been \"the impoverishment of editorial debate compared with other Romantic writers, the absence of challenging alternative views, the deadening hand of the authorised 'definitive version'.\" </p> <p>For 35 years scholars have grumbled, and sometimes tried to resist this singular control of Clare. In recent years, such writers as Zachary Leader and Hugh Haughton have criticised the effects of the copyright claim. But it was not until last July that anyone did anything about it. Then, a young Clare scholar whose PhD I supervised, Simon K\u00f6vesi of the University of Dundee, published a selection of Clare's Love Poems, openly refusing to accept the validity of the copyright claim. </p> <p>Four months later, he and his publisher received letters from Robinson's solicitors, Harbottle and Lewis, claiming a breach of Robinson's \"copyright in those works written by John Clare which were not published during his lifetime\". The letters also claim, for good measure, that poems in the anthology were taken from Robinson's edited texts, and that K\u00f6vesi had defamed Robinson \"both on the internet and to journalists\". K\u00f6vesi and his publisher deny both these accusations. </p> <p>Robinson, said his lawyers, was \"entitled to damages together with an undertaking that you will not infringe, in the future, the copyrights that he holds\". K\u00f6vesi and his publisher were invited to supply, within 21 days, proposals for \"compensating Professor Robinson\", with the threat of \"immediate legal proceedings\" should they fail to supply such proposals. </p> <p>So how did this extraordinary situation come about? </p> <p>As an officially patronised \"peasant poet\", the young John Clare had much of his income tied into trusts, managed on his behalf by two trustees, his London publisher, John Taylor, and his local clergyman, the Reverend Mr Mossop. After the relative popularity of his first two books, Poems Descriptive Of Rural Life And Scenery (1820) and The Village Minstrel (1821), literary success increasingly evaded Clare, and the two other volumes published in his lifetime, The Shepherd's Calendar (1827) and The Rural Muse (1835), were subject to delay and heavy editorial cutting. As he became more prone to depression and illness, Clare worried about the legacy of his copyright and the income from his publications, and drafted several wills, though none was probated on his death. </p> <p>Even as his literary hopes were fading, Clare was writing some of his best poetry, and he would continue to write almost to the end of his life. His two most anthologised poems, \"I Am\" and \"Little Trotty Wagtail\", were written in the asylum, as were more than 1,000 others, many of them transcribed by the asylum attendant WF Knight. During the long asylum years, his loyal supporters made several attempts to revive interest in his work and create new editions of it, but nothing came of any of these plans. After his death, however, more determined efforts began to be made, and this is where the story of Clare's copyright really begins. </p> <p>Under the 1842 Copyright Act which was in force at Clare's death, in the case of published works copyright endured for 42 years after publication or seven years after the author's death, whichever was later. Thus three of Clare's published volumes came out of copyright in 1871, and the fourth in 1877. For unpublished works, however, copyright was a very different matter. Under common law, an author, or after his death his personal representative, retained perpetual control over his work as long as it remained unpublished. This is particularly important in Clare's case, since his four published volumes contained only about 10% of his total output - some 300 poems out of more than 3,000 he wrote in his lifetime. </p> <p>This common law \"perpetual\" loophole for unpublished material was written into the Copyright Acts of 1911 and 1956, and finally replaced in the 1988 Act with a finite, 50-year term of protection (made potentially extendable by a further 25 years in a 1996 Act). In Clare's case, this could extend the copyright claim well into the middle of this century, though, as Jonathan Griffiths of Nottingham Law School has argued, such a claim could be open to challenge under the freedom of expression legislation in the Human Rights Act 1998, due to come into force in October. </p> <p>It is by no means clear whether Clare's personal representative after his death was his widow Patty Clare, or his trustees; nor is it obvious that the enticing legal vision of perpetual power over the work was continuously transmitted through a hundred-year period to the current claim, though a simple provenance can be deduced. The key figure is Joseph Whitaker (1820-95), now remembered for Whitaker's Almanack but known in his time as an astute publisher who was, as the Dictionary of National Biography says, \"recognised as an authority upon copyright\". Planning his own edition of Clare, he made in May 1864 a \"provisional bargain\", presumably verbal, with the dying John Taylor, to pay Patty Clare \u00a310 a year in exchange for manuscripts and publication rights. Then, on 8 August, he signed an agreement with Patty and her children for the transfer of their rights to Clare's copyrights. This agreement, discovered in the archive of the Whitaker publishing house in 1932, was destroyed with the rest of the archive by a German bomb eight years later. </p> <p>Whitaker's edition of Clare never materialised, and although he clearly insisted on his ownership of the unpublished material's copyright in relation to the publication of JL Cherry's Life And Remains Of John Clare (1873), there is evidence to suggest that by the time of his death in 1895 he had either relinquished it, or passed it on to the Peterborough Museum Society, along with the bulk of Clare's manuscripts. Certainly none of the many editions of Clare between 1895 and 1965 acknowledged any general copyright holder. Robinson's purchase from Whitaker's, on 9 July 1965, for \u00a31, of \"all rights whatsoever possessed by the company in the published and unpublished works of John Clare\" initiated the revival of a claim that appears to have been defunct for 70 years. </p> <p>The revival has helped to ensure that Robinson's many editions of Clare have dominated the field for a generation. The positive side of this has been the bringing into the light of thousands of Clare poems unknown to earlier readers, as well as major prose works. The downside is that it has tended to sideline and sometimes blight the work of other scholars, and to make life harder, for example, for Clare enthusiasts such as folk musicians who wish to compile tapes or CDs of Clare material. It is possible to get permission from Robinson's literary agents, Curtis Brown, to use unpublished Clare material, but it is likely to cost money. And, as I discovered last year as the editor of an edition of Clare's writings of 1841, it is a tiresome process that can involve prevarication and delay. Our edition was set back several months. </p> <p>Much more serious problems can also arise. In my 15 years of Clare scholarship I have heard many tales of blighted projects. Perhaps the most notable is the case of the late Geoffrey Summerfield, who believed that the copyright claim was used to press him into rewriting an account of how he came to start working on Clare in the 1950s. </p> <p>The problems created by a single individual controlling the posthumous publications of a major literary figure have been evident in several high-profile modern cases, such as those of James Joyce and Sylvia Plath. With Clare (as with Joyce) there is the vital question of how he is to be edited. </p> <p>The copyright has helped to ensure the overwhelming predominance of a single editing style: the so-called \"textual primitivist\" presentation where nothing of the text is corrected or standardised from the manuscript. After the heavy correction of earlier editions, this seemed to create a refreshingly raw \"authenticity\" in Clare's work, described by John Barrell as being like \"discovering the original of a great painting previously known only through engravings\". But its dominance has also limited Clare's accessibility, denying him the wider audience that his poetry deserves. </p> <p>For Clare is, as the Independent's literary editor Boyd Tonkin recently put it, \"The People's Poet\". He speaks for the common people and for the dispossessed (birds, animals, flowers as well as people). He is important for many who have suffered from mental health problems, for ecologists and for nature-lovers. It is a grotesque anomaly for one person to try to control a poet from the 19th century, particularly one who, as Tim Chilcott notes, \"so tellingly damned all manifestations of 'property', 'possession' and 'enclosure'\". </p> <p>But \"The People\" seem at last to have begun fighting back. K\u00f6vesi's decision to publish and be damned began a continuing campaign. Last week a letter supporting K\u00f6vesi appeared in the TLS signed by Seamus Heaney, Andrew Motion, Tom Paulin and 25 other Clare scholars. The threatening letter from Harbottle and Lewis received a polite but firm reply from K\u00f6vesi's publisher, Mike Gorman of M&amp;C Services, requesting proof that Robinson genuinely owns the copyright to Clare's unpublished works. This has been met with six months of silence. </p> <p>K\u00f6vesi is now preparing his second \"unauthorised\" edition, John Clare: Flower Poems, which will be published in October. \"Until clear proof is offered that the copyright claim is legitimate,\" he says, \"I will continue to publish Clare in accessible and easily available editions, and I would urge others to do the same. I think the copyright claim has damaged Clare studies, and it is now time that it was laid to rest.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Goodridge is reader in English at Nottingham Trent University and editor of the John Clare Society Journal.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Equitable Life's 90,000 guaranteed annuity policyholders scooped the jackpot this week after a three-year legal wrangle which culminated in total defeat for the company and forced the 238-year-old mutual into a takeover. </p> <p>The guaranteed policyholders will see their pension payouts increased by around 25% as a result of the ruling, plus they may be in line for windfalls expected to average \u00a34,000 following the demutualisation and takeover of the company. Michael Simmons (pictured above right), a solicitor with London law firm Finers Stephens Innocent, is typical of the high net worth clients that make up most of Equitable's policyholders. </p> <p>He says he expects his pension income to rise by around \u00a325,000 a year to \u00a3115,000 from the \u00a390,000 before the House of Lords ruling. He says: \"The Law Lords ruling is a great pleasure and relief, combined with sadness that Equitable Life has made such a pig's ear of the whole thing.\" </p> <p>The losers are the many more policyholders, around 500,000 people, who hold policies without the guaranteed element. Equitable Life says they will be hit by the ruling, but is not being explicit as to how. </p> <p>Managing director Alan Nash says: \"We will need to look at the returns guaranteed policyholders will receive, and what impact that may have on other policyholders. As regards the values quoted in December 31, 1999 policies, we can expect those to still apply. Non-guaranteed policy- holders will be hit by this judgment, but we do not expect policy values to fall.\" </p> <p>In other words, the 'hit' on non-guaranteed policyholders is likely to be lower future bonuses. However, this is almost certain to be offset by the money that will be pumped into the company when it is taken over. So non-guaranteed policyholders may still not lose out, and will also, if they have a qualifying with-profits policy, gain from any windfalls. </p> <p>Early indications are that there is a queue of buyers wanting to snap up Equi table, which has an enviable reputation as a highly efficient provider of pension policies to high net worth clients who include high court judges, investment bankers and Harley Street doctors. Analysts are pencilling in a takeover price of around \u00a33.5bn-\u00a34bn, with Barclays and Dutch insurer Aegon named as the likely frontrunners in an auction for the company. </p> <p>Shared between Equitable's 600,000 policyholders, the price tag equates to average windfalls of \u00a36,500-\u00a37,000, in line with the payouts made when Lloyds TSB bought Scottish Widows. However, the windfalls will be deflated by the need for any acquirer to set aside \u00a31.5bn to rebuild Equitable's long-term fund, depleted by the payouts to the guaranteed policies. </p> <p>Therefore windfalls are likely to be reduced to an average of \u00a34,000 or less. The windfalls will be lower than the figures enjoyed in other demutualisations because Equitable has a policy of keeping small reserves and paying out the maximum possible to policyholders. </p> <p>Other insurers regularly squirrel away money to meet future potential liabilities, holding 'free assets' worth around 15%-20% of the with-profits fund. But Equitable's free asset ratio is much closer to 5%, leaving less cash to be paid out on a sale. </p> <p>Independent life insurance analyst Ned Cazalet says: \"The existing policyholders are generating little profit for shareholders to get their paws on, so that will reduce the amount of windfall policyholders can expect.\" </p> <p>But the good news is that the payouts will come sooner rather than later. Corporate financiers expect the sale of Equitable, being handled by Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, to be carried out swiftly. Last year Equitable Life revealed that it had put aside \u00a31.5bn in reserves to meet guaranteed annuity promises, raising questions as to why it now feels it must demutualise. </p> <p>The cost would also have drip-fed its way through Equitable's accounts over many years. But managing director Alan Nash says that while Equitable's solvency position would not have been hit hard by the payouts, it would have constrained its freedom to invest in equities. </p> <p>The extra liabilities created by the guarantees would force the company to buy government stock, known as gilts, and sell shares, thereby reducing its long-term returns. </p> <p>Mr Nash said: \"Our investment freedom would have been so curtailed by the judgment that it would not have been in the interests of policy- holders for Equitable to continue as a mutual.\" </p> <p><strong>Your questions answered</strong></p> <p><strong> I have a guaranteed annuity policy with Equitable. How much more will I now receive?</strong> </p> <p>The average increase is put at around 25%. The exact figure will depend on the level of annuity guarantee written in your contract. Typically, this is around 11%, compared to current annuity rates of around 8% for a 65-year old man. Annuity rates vary with age, so for example, one policyholder, 72-year old Dr David Abrams, will be able to claim an annuity of 14.7% compared to 12% currently on offer. </p> <p><strong> I had a guaranteed policy but took the benefits several years ago. Will I be compensated?</strong> </p> <p>Equitable says yes, but it's not clear how or when. The annuity guarantees only became valuable when market annuity rates fell below the promised rate in the mid-1990s. David Hyman, who brought the case against Equitable, is in this position. \"I took the terminal bonus but didn't get the guarantee. They will now have to put that right.\" </p> <p><strong> Has the guarantee got any strings attached?</strong> </p> <p>Yes. It only applies if you take out a single life annuity. That means that your spouse will not continue to enjoy benefits after you die. </p> <p><strong> I'm one of the policyholders without a guarantee. Am I now worse off?</strong> </p> <p>Equitable says you will take a hit, but (as explained above) the portion of the sale proceeds of the company put into the long-term fund should prevent a decline in bonuses. Bonuses already attached to policies cannot be withdrawn, and Equitable says policy valuations made at the end of last year will not be affected. </p> <p><strong> Where do the figures for \u00a34,000 windfalls come from?</strong> </p> <p>It's anybody's guess what the windfalls will be. The City is expecting a sale price of \u00a34bn, but \u00a31.5bn will immediately go into bolstering the long-term fund to provide for guaranteed annuities. The rest will be split between anybody who has a with profits policy. \u00a32.5bn divided between 600,000 members works out at just over \u00a34,000 each. </p> <p><strong> Will I receive shares in Equitable?</strong> </p> <p>Almost certainly not. It will not be a demutualisation and floatation on the stock exchange in the style of Norwich Union, but a takeover in the same way as Lloyds TSB bought Scottish Widows. </p> <p><strong> Can I carpetbag Equitable?</strong> </p> <p>No. Equitable says: \"Members joining the society from and including July 20, 2000, will not participate in any benefits derived from the sale of the business.\"</p>",

Early indications are that there is a queue of buyers wanting to snap up Equi table, which has an enviable reputation as a highly efficient provider of pension policies to high net worth clients who include high court judges, investment bankers and Harley Street doctors. Analysts are pencilling in a takeover price of around \u00a33.5bn-\u00a34bn, with Barclays and Dutch insurer Aegon named as the likely frontrunners in an auction for the company. Shared between Equitable's 600,000 policyholders, the price tag equates to average windfalls of \u00a36,500-\u00a37,000, in line with the payouts made when Lloyds TSB bought Scottish Widows. However, the windfalls will be deflated by the need for any acquirer to set aside \u00a31.5bn to rebuild Equitable's long-term fund, depleted by the payouts to the guaranteed policies. Therefore windfalls are likely to be reduced to an average of \u00a34,000 or less. The windfalls will be lower than the figures enjoyed in other demutualisations because Equitable has a policy of keeping small reserves and paying out the maximum possible to policyholders. Other insurers regularly squirrel away money to meet future potential liabilities, holding 'free assets' worth around 15%-20% of the with-profits fund. But Equitable's free asset ratio is much closer to 5%, leaving less cash to be paid out on a sale. Independent life insurance analyst Ned Cazalet says: \"The existing policyholders are generating little profit for shareholders to get their paws on, so that will reduce the amount of windfall policyholders can expect.\" But the good news is that the payouts will come sooner rather than later. Corporate financiers expect the sale of Equitable, being handled by Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, to be carried out swiftly. Last year Equitable Life revealed that it had put aside \u00a31.5bn in reserves to meet guaranteed annuity promises, raising questions as to why it now feels it must demutualise. The cost would also have drip-fed its way through Equitable's accounts over many years. But managing director Alan Nash says that while Equitable's solvency position would not have been hit hard by the payouts, it would have constrained its freedom to invest in equities. The extra liabilities created by the guarantees would force the company to buy government stock, known as gilts, and sell shares, thereby reducing its long-term returns. Mr Nash said: \"Our investment freedom would have been so curtailed by the judgment that it would not have been in the interests of policy- holders for Equitable to continue as a mutual.\" Your questions answered I have a guaranteed annuity policy with Equitable. How much more will I now receive? The average increase is put at around 25%. The exact figure will depend on the level of annuity guarantee written in your contract. Typically, this is around 11%, compared to current annuity rates of around 8% for a 65-year old man. Annuity rates vary with age, so for example, one policyholder, 72-year old Dr David Abrams, will be able to claim an annuity of 14.7% compared to 12% currently on offer. I had a guaranteed policy but took the benefits several years ago. Will I be compensated? Equitable says yes, but it's not clear how or when. The annuity guarantees only became valuable when market annuity rates fell below the promised rate in the mid-1990s. David Hyman, who brought the case against Equitable, is in this position. \"I took the terminal bonus but didn't get the guarantee. They will now have to put that right.\" Has the guarantee got any strings attached? Yes. It only applies if you take out a single life annuity. That means that your spouse will not continue to enjoy benefits after you die. I'm one of the policyholders without a guarantee. Am I now worse off? Equitable says you will take a hit, but (as explained above) the portion of the sale proceeds of the company put into the long-term fund should prevent a decline in bonuses. Bonuses already attached to policies cannot be withdrawn, and Equitable says policy valuations made at the end of last year will not be affected. Where do the figures for \u00a34,000 windfalls come from? It's anybody's guess what the windfalls will be. The City is expecting a sale price of \u00a34bn, but \u00a31.5bn will immediately go into bolstering the long-term fund to provide for guaranteed annuities. The rest will be split between anybody who has a with profits policy. \u00a32.5bn divided between 600,000 members works out at just over \u00a34,000 each. Will I receive shares in Equitable? Almost certainly not. It will not be a demutualisation and floatation on the stock exchange in the style of Norwich Union, but a takeover in the same way as Lloyds TSB bought Scottish Widows. Can I carpetbag Equitable? No. Equitable says: \"Members joining the society from and including July 20, 2000, will not participate in any benefits derived from the sale of the business.\"",

      "bodyText": "Opponents of the US embargo on Cuba claimed an important tactical victory yesterday after the US House of Representatives voted to lift the sanctions on food and medicine and relax the ban on Americans travelling to the island. But the vote late on Thursday night does not necessarily mean that the sanctions will be dropped. The proposal was part of a treasury spending bill, and would stop the US treasury enforcing the sanctions. But the Senate version of the bill contains no clauses on Cuba, and the Republican Senate leader, Trent Lott, has refused to let them be added. The 232-186 vote in the house clearly reflected a fundamental shift of opinion in Congress. Sixty Republicans, many from farm states desperate for new export markets, defied their leaders and voted for change. The vote will increase pressure on the Republican leadership to let a compromise bill on Cuba, which was agreed upon last month, go to the Senate for a vote. The compromise bill would allow US exports of food and medicine to Cuba, but not two-way trade. Cuba would only be able to buy US goods with cash or foreign credit. The ban on US tourism in Cuba would stay in place and could no longer be adjusted by presidential decree. For that reason, the compromise bill was opposed by the White House, which claimed it abrogated presidential powers; the legislation appeared to be stuck in limbo. Congressional officials said yesterday that, even after the house vote, it was unclear whether Senator Lott could be persuaded to allow a vote on Cuban sanctions before the end of the year. But Mark Sanford, the South Carolina Republican who proposed the house measures, said the vote was a sign that legislators were increasingly prepared to engage the government of Cuba, just as they had sought to end the isolation of the governments of China and Vietnam. \"This marks the beginning of the an end for an outdated policy towards Cuba,\" Mr Sanford said. \"We've tried 40 years of isolation; it has not worked. The will of the house is that we take this incremental step.\" Republican opponents of the embargo argued that US tourism and exchange programmes with communist countries in the Soviet bloc had contributed to the collapse of the iron curtain, and the same strategy of engagement should be tried with Cuba. But Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who has been a staunch supporter of sanctions, pointed out that even if the house bill became law it would only prevent the US treasury enforcing the ban on travel to Cuba.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Day 8</strong></p> <p> The first XI go back to St Catherine's to play their first XI colts team, known as St Philip's. Again, many of the players are younger than we are, and some double up to play in both the first and seconds, due in part to limited numbers of boys in each year. (Possibly limited also by the weekly commitment to train which Bajan clubs require.) The U12s are at Windward, where we played last Friday.</p> <p>I win the toss and put them in. In these parts, the wicket tends to be wet first thing and the ball will stop and seam for about an hour. Bowling first is a significant advantage and, arguably, my most useful function as captain is to win the toss. St Philip's are too weak for us and we rapidly bowl them out for 88 and knock the runs off in 13 overs or so. As I am still not quite fit, I do not bring myself on to bowl and don't bat either. Our opponents have gone overboard on hospitality and we all eat far too much - I do not know what Nancy Doyle would have made of Bajan food, but it is delicious. Because the game ends early we have time to play with their side informally, which is a lot of fun.</p> <p>Timothy recruits four of our host players to bowl at him. He points out that my season may end on Friday, but he has a Gubby Allen final at Lord's on August 6 and a number of county matches. St Philip's are hoping to go on tour and buy some kit; they plan to finance these activities with a sponsored event. All the parents and the school contribute. Once Mackie, Team Schneider's driver and general <em>homme d'affaires</em>, arrives we have sufficient transport to get everyone home without waiting the extra hour or so for the team bus. On getting back to the team hotel, I learn that the U12s tied.</p> <p><strong>Day 9</strong></p> <p> The first XI is playing the National Sports Council combined side at a club called \"Yorkshire\". Any resemblance was impossible to find. This was a good side with two excellent batsmen in Philips and Steel (who is only 11). Oddly, I think I have met him before. We were to play a 30-over match. They made 148-6 with Philips making 73. At 52-1 we looked in good shape when we lost the first wicket, as we did at 93-2, when I was run out. We then contrived to make very heavy weather of things and got to the last over on 147-9. We ended on 148 all out.</p> <p>As there was no arrangement relating to the loss of fewer wickets, I believe the result was a tie. JC generously concedes defeat. One gentleman tells my father that one-day matches can never end in a tie. Dad points out that he was at the most famous tie of all, the semi-final of last year's World Cup and that a one-day match will end in a tie unless there is agreement to the contrary, as the Laws state that the winner is the side which scores most runs. Vigorous argument ensues over a few beers.</p> <p>RAK wins the dunce of the day for directing three sets of people to the wrong ground to watch the U12s. Worse, one set is the Headmaster and his wife, who have just arrived. He wears the red Ascot hat with aplomb at the evening barbeque.</p> <p><strong>Day 10</strong></p> <p>We have a day off. Most of the team go to Harrison's Caves and on a submarine trip to see the reef. JC, Rupert Haddon and I play golf at Royal Westmoreland. The round takes forever largely due to my completely inept play. Haddon (aged 13) goes round in 81, pars on the last six holes.</p> <p>I have a chance to reflect on the tour so far. It has been a great success. The bat we have presented to each side we have played has been much appreciated. We have given each player a miniature ball from Lord's and a tour brochure. Kit is expensive and is hard to come by for lots of the kids we play. It occurs to me that MCC allegedly have 10,000 new balls that are branded \"Made in England\" but aren't. They cannot be sold in England and are supposed to be a bit hard, but they would make a magnificent gift to youth cricket in the Caribbean and other developing countries.</p> <p>Interestingly, I realise I have never been so upset at getting out than I was yesterday. Perhaps I am learning to take this game sufficiently seriously. It may be only a game, but there is no point playing if you don't play hard.</p> <p>Lastly, whilst our catching has (with certain honourable exceptions) been erratic our ground fielding has been outstanding and much commented upon. On the other hand the ground fielding of all our opponents has been, frankly, poor. Perhaps we do not take the bumpy surfaces for granted. For whatever reason, it is nice to be able to write that an English side has outfielded the opposition.</p> <p><strong>Day 11</strong></p> <p>The first XI is playing at Wanderers. This is the second oldest club in the Caribbean and has a wonderful wooden two-storey pavilion. Our nemesis, Simon Steel, is playing for Wanderers. His father, Malcolm and my mother realise we had all met at the Bridgetown Test in March 1999. Again, I win the toss. At 15-3 and 49-5 it looks a good toss to have won. Unhappily, Steel is not back in the pavilion and he makes a wonderful 65. Eventually he was run out; there was no other way we would have got him. Wanderers reach 143 all out off the full 35 overs. I am not sure we would have held it together so well.</p> <p>Whilst in the field, I notice Timothy in the nets being bowled at by fathers and Wanderers players. His regime seems to be 15-minute net, half-hour rest and then on go the pads and helmet for another net. He tells me at lunch that the break is for the benefit of the bowlers. I enquire about the helmet. He tells me severely that nets have to be as near as being in the middle to be of any use and that he therefore wears his helmet, even for throw downs, and has imaginary fielders in place! When we bat, despite a little wobble, we get home with half a dozen overs in hand, thanks to a rapid fifty from Tom Turney.</p> <p><strong>Day 12</strong></p> <p> Before we go to our respective matches, the entire party is taken to have its photo taken at Kensington Oval, a very nice touch. The square at the Oval is only four pitches wide. It is wonderful to see how much use they get out of a wicket, but hardly surprising. Grounds are lovingly and immaculately maintained, with wickets being rolled between innings and immediately after play even for our schoolboy events. Smaller clubs in outlying areas may supplement ground staff with a complement of native goats, tethered in areas of the outfield in rotation.</p> <p>The first XI is playing the National Sports Council side again at Dover. The ground is actually a football field with two strips in the middle, bounded on three sides by busy local streets. Eight of their side from the other day, including Philips, are playing, but not Steel. A passer-by tells me that the selectors are mad or venal or both for omitting Karim, the quick bowler we met at Windward. If interest in cricket is declining in these parts, it hasn't affected our audience, who spectate noisily from beyond the boundary or atop their hastily parked cars. I lose the toss, but it is of no consequence. We set off at a tremendous rate, keep going and reach 246 all out off exactly 35 overs. Whilst a couple of players make fifties, it has to be recorded that 45 runs were gifted by letting ones become fours. The boundaries are very short, so alert and accurate fielding is essential. Nonetheless, we lunch with quiet confidence.</p> <p>Early on, they are three wickets down. Philips is run out when there was never a run. The non-striker goes past him when Philips is standing six inches outside his crease, sending him back to no avail. Having waited for them to cross, we break the bowler\u0092s end stumps. I am delighted by this display of cricketing brains. I bowl a player around his legs with my first ball. Haddon and Turney both take two wickets with successive balls. At 139-9 off about 30 overs, I bring myself back on and conclude the day's entertainment with my first ball.</p> <p>At the presentation we hand over another bat and can see Tuesday's bat already getting good use!</p>",

He points out that my season may end on Friday, but he has a Gubby Allen final at Lord's on August 6 and a number of county matches. St Philip's are hoping to go on tour and buy some kit; they plan to finance these activities with a sponsored event. All the parents and the school contribute. Once Mackie, Team Schneider's driver and general homme d'affaires, arrives we have sufficient transport to get everyone home without waiting the extra hour or so for the team bus. On getting back to the team hotel, I learn that the U12s tied. Day 9 The first XI is playing the National Sports Council combined side at a club called \"Yorkshire\". Any resemblance was impossible to find. This was a good side with two excellent batsmen in Philips and Steel (who is only 11). Oddly, I think I have met him before. We were to play a 30-over match. They made 148-6 with Philips making 73. At 52-1 we looked in good shape when we lost the first wicket, as we did at 93-2, when I was run out. We then contrived to make very heavy weather of things and got to the last over on 147-9. We ended on 148 all out. As there was no arrangement relating to the loss of fewer wickets, I believe the result was a tie. JC generously concedes defeat. One gentleman tells my father that one-day matches can never end in a tie. Dad points out that he was at the most famous tie of all, the semi-final of last year's World Cup and that a one-day match will end in a tie unless there is agreement to the contrary, as the Laws state that the winner is the side which scores most runs. Vigorous argument ensues over a few beers. RAK wins the dunce of the day for directing three sets of people to the wrong ground to watch the U12s. Worse, one set is the Headmaster and his wife, who have just arrived. He wears the red Ascot hat with aplomb at the evening barbeque. Day 10 We have a day off. Most of the team go to Harrison's Caves and on a submarine trip to see the reef. JC, Rupert Haddon and I play golf at Royal Westmoreland. The round takes forever largely due to my completely inept play. Haddon (aged 13) goes round in 81, pars on the last six holes. I have a chance to reflect on the tour so far. It has been a great success. The bat we have presented to each side we have played has been much appreciated. We have given each player a miniature ball from Lord's and a tour brochure. Kit is expensive and is hard to come by for lots of the kids we play. It occurs to me that MCC allegedly have 10,000 new balls that are branded \"Made in England\" but aren't. They cannot be sold in England and are supposed to be a bit hard, but they would make a magnificent gift to youth cricket in the Caribbean and other developing countries. Interestingly, I realise I have never been so upset at getting out than I was yesterday. Perhaps I am learning to take this game sufficiently seriously. It may be only a game, but there is no point playing if you don't play hard. Lastly, whilst our catching has (with certain honourable exceptions) been erratic our ground fielding has been outstanding and much commented upon. On the other hand the ground fielding of all our opponents has been, frankly, poor. Perhaps we do not take the bumpy surfaces for granted. For whatever reason, it is nice to be able to write that an English side has outfielded the opposition. Day 11 The first XI is playing at Wanderers. This is the second oldest club in the Caribbean and has a wonderful wooden two-storey pavilion. Our nemesis, Simon Steel, is playing for Wanderers. His father, Malcolm and my mother realise we had all met at the Bridgetown Test in March 1999. Again, I win the toss. At 15-3 and 49-5 it looks a good toss to have won. Unhappily, Steel is not back in the pavilion and he makes a wonderful 65. Eventually he was run out; there was no other way we would have got him. Wanderers reach 143 all out off the full 35 overs. I am not sure we would have held it together so well. Whilst in the field, I notice Timothy in the nets being bowled at by fathers and Wanderers players. His regime seems to be 15-minute net, half-hour rest and then on go the pads and helmet for another net. He tells me at lunch that the break is for the benefit of the bowlers. I enquire about the helmet. He tells me severely that nets have to be as near as being in the middle to be of any use and that he therefore wears his helmet, even for throw downs, and has imaginary fielders in place! When we bat, despite a little wobble, we get home with half a dozen overs in hand, thanks to a rapid fifty from Tom Turney. Day 12 Before we go to our respective matches, the entire party is taken to have its photo taken at Kensington Oval, a very nice touch. The square at the Oval is only four pitches wide. It is wonderful to see how much use they get out of a wicket, but hardly surprising. Grounds are lovingly and immaculately maintained, with wickets being rolled between innings and immediately after play even for our schoolboy events. Smaller clubs in outlying areas may supplement ground staff with a complement of native goats, tethered in areas of the outfield in rotation. The first XI is playing the National Sports Council side again at Dover. The ground is actually a football field with two strips in the middle, bounded on three sides by busy local streets. Eight of their side from the other day, including Philips, are playing, but not Steel. A passer-by tells me that the selectors are mad or venal or both for omitting Karim, the quick bowler we met at Windward. If interest in cricket is declining in these parts, it hasn't affected our audience, who spectate noisily from beyond the boundary or atop their hastily parked cars. I lose the toss, but it is of no consequence. We set off at a tremendous rate, keep going and reach 246 all out off exactly 35 overs. Whilst a couple of players make fifties, it has to be recorded that 45 runs were gifted by letting ones become fours. The boundaries are very short, so alert and accurate fielding is essential. Nonetheless, we lunch with quiet confidence. Early on, they are three wickets down. Philips is run out when there was never a run. The non-striker goes past him when Philips is standing six inches outside his crease, sending him back to no avail. Having waited for them to cross, we break the bowler\u0092s end stumps. I am delighted by this display of cricketing brains. I bowl a player around his legs with my first ball. Haddon and Turney both take two wickets with successive balls. At 139-9 off about 30 overs, I bring myself back on and conclude the day's entertainment with my first ball. At the presentation we hand over another bat and can see Tuesday's bat already getting good use!",

However it has been aggressively promoted within British-Asian communities and large crowds are expected. </p> <p>The organisers are confident that gains will be made.

The onus has to be on the community and also on the football authorities, who could be doing a lot more. </p> <p>\"But the fact that the Indian team is here is sending out an important message.

Average league attendances for the city's main clubs are around 50,000. FC Kochin often draw crowds of more than 60,000. Chima Okorie, a striker who who left his native Nigeria to study in India where he was spotted playing for his university and later appeared for all three Calcutta clubs, says: \"The atmosphere is absolutely electric during derby matches or for any important game. In my first match for Mohammadan we played East Bengal and there was a crowd of 150,000. \"For the people football is like life and death; their team means everything to them. If a team beats another in a derby then they will have a massive party that carries on for days.\" Given the Indian team's limited abilities there are fears that the tour could have a negative impact and reinforce stereotypes. However it has been aggressively promoted within British-Asian communities and large crowds are expected. The organisers are confident that gains will be made. Jas Baines, who is involved in the promotion of Asian football, says: \"There are serious concerns about the lack of British Asians within football. The onus has to be on the community and also on the football authorities, who could be doing a lot more. \"But the fact that the Indian team is here is sending out an important message. It is breaking a stereotype and hopefully we will get people who do not normally watch live football to come to stadiums. It's good for the clubs and their community work and it's good for football.\" British Asians with Premier prospects Harpal Singh Leeds United The 18-year-old left-winger has been tipped to be the first Asian to play for England at any level. He was recently voted the most promising player by his academy team-mates. Already established in the reserves, he is close to a first-team call-up. Born in Pudsey, he was spotted playing for a local league club and signed during George Graham's reign. Anwar Uddin West Ham United Also 18, this traditional English-style centre-half established himself in the reserves at Upton Park last season and has excellent first-team prospects. He recently won praise for his performances in a youth tournament in America. Born in Stepney Green, he was spotted playing for an east London boys' club. He is in the final year of a YTS contract.",

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. *Note: in a draw where the scores finish level , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points.

His last two dismissals, however, have turned the attention on to his technique as he has twice been defeated playing forward to balls of extra bounce. A habitual front-foot bully, he would have benefited more than any other young batsman from a season on bouncy Australian pitches. </p> <p>Few will question Hussain's analysis that Trescothick has taken to international cricket more naturally than any English batsman since Graham Thorpe, so much so that even a failure today would be unlikely to prevent a Test debut at Old Trafford on August 3 for the Somerset left-hander. </p> <p>\"People ask whether his one-day performances are valid when considering him with regard to Test cricket, and in this case I think they are very valid. He has something about him,\" said Hussain. </p> <p>Paul Franks did not prosper so readily. His assertive approach has even won respect at Surrey, where they value physical and verbal aggression, but he went wicketless on his one-day debut at Trent Bridge and Andrew Caddick will return today. </p> <p>England's last one-day trophy seems a long time ago. When Adam Hollioake's side won the Singer-Akai Trophy in Sharjah, more than 2 years ago, it was heralded as a new era: Adam Hollioake and Michael Atherton operating as distinct one-day and Test captains leading two very different teams. </p> <p>Hollioake's stock fell as quickly as it had risen, and Alec Stewart's appointment brought to an end the split-captaincy experiment.

This is the evocative terrain of Hetty Pegler's Tump and the Devil's Chimney while on this very ground, we are unreliably assured, the Gloucestershire and England prince of batsmen once hit a golf ball in a post-match challenge from the shadow of the chapel to the distant college lawn. At the present rate of anecdotal licence, the ball will in time have landed to disturb the wildlife amid the blue haze of Cleeve Hill. It looked at one point as if Gloucestershire might need something equally miraculous today to produce that elusive Championship win. Warwickshire were all out for 316 at the close, for a lead of 323, but it could easily have been more. Cheltenham's regulars take the same vantage point for every visit.
