      "body": "<p>Last autumn, when the anti-capitalist protesters were on the streets of Prague, the International Monetary Fund said the global economy was in its finest fettle for a decade. Yesterday, the IMF admitted it had been wrong. </p> <p>Since last September, it said, prospects for world growth had \"weakened significantly\", with a marked slowdown in the once booming US, another false dawn in Japan and a moderation of Europe's expansion. The countries best placed to survive are China and India: both have deliberately chosen to liberalise slowly and integrate with the global economy at their own pace. There will be no violent protests at this weekend's meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, but turmoil of one sort has been exchanged for another. As Harold Wilson might have said, eight months is a long time in economics. </p> <p>Michael Mussa, the IMF's head of economics, said some easing of the breakneck pace of growth in the first part of 2000 had been necessary, but that \"it is now clear that growth is slowing more than was anticipated or was desirable\". It had been assumed the US would gradually slow to a more sustainable rate, enjoying what economists call a soft landing. </p> <p>However, soft landings tend to be about as common as sightings of the Himalayan snow leopard, as the IMF itself admitted yesterday. \"As experience over the past central decades has shown, soft landings are not easy to achieve.\" </p> <p>The IMF identifies two key reasons for what has happened since the middle of last year. First, the US economy has suffered a series of shocks - higher energy prices, a downgrading of corporate earnings prospects accompanied by a sharp fall in equity markets, particularly in the technology sector, and dearer borrowing costs - which have combined to generate a severe slowdown in domestic demand growth and a pronounced weakening in consumer and business confidence. </p> <p>Second, the perennial problem of Japan, where the temporary boost to the economy in the first half of last year petered out as a result of lowered consumer confidence, an easing of investment and lower exports. Unlike in the US, where the IMF is upbeat about the chances of the downturn being short-lived, it sees a sustained recovery in Japan as still some way off. With interest rates already at zero and a huge budget deficit caused by boosts to public spending over the past decade, \"there is limited room for policy manoeuvre\", and the economy remains vulnerable to additional shocks. </p> <p>As a result of these problems in the world's two largest single economies, the IMF's twice-yearly world economic outlook has shaved a full percentage point off its forecast for global growth this year, which is now expected to be 3.2%. </p> <p>The scale and the speed of the downturn in the US means the IMF has more than halved its growth prediction for the US from 3.2% to 1.5%, and Japan has been downgraded from 1.8% to 0.6%. The third biggest economy - Germany - is also likely to underperform last autumn's expectations, growing at 1.9% rather than the 3.3% forecast. </p> <p>With inflation low around the globe, the IMF believes policymakers should be adopting strategies to boost growth. \"Inflation remains a concern in some faster growing European countries and in a number of developing and transition [from communism] countries, but in general inflationary risks do not materially circumscribe policymakers' freedom of action at this stage.\" </p> <p>This can be summed in three short words: go for it. As the IMF sees it, both commodity prices and consumer price inflation have been on a downward trend for the past 20 years. Long-term interest rates - a sign of market expectations of future inflation - have come down too, and that gives central banks and finance ministries an chance to cut short-term rates, thereby boosting growth. </p> <p>This is the approach being followed by the US Federal Reserve, which has cut two percentage points off borrowing costs since January, and it is evident that the IMF thoroughly approves of what Alan Greenspan has been doing. It believes that early action by the Fed, buttressed by the actions of other central banks, means that there is a reasonable prospect that the slowdown will be short-lived. </p> <p>Its baseline scenario is that the US starts to recover in the second half of 2001, Europe remains relatively robust and Japan finally turns the corner in 2002. But having been too optimistic in the autumn, the IMF is more cautious about what happens next. \"This scenario is certainly plausible, but it is far from assured - experience suggests that when turning points are reached, the shift in momentum is often more pronounced than expected.\" </p> <p>This is a polite way of saying that economic forecasting, rather than being an exact science, is actually more of a shot in the dark. In particular, it is impossible to know how US consumers will respond to recent events, and for how much longer foreign investors will retain their faith in the US dollar. US growth prospects would be seriously impaired were consumers to embark on a sustained period of belt-tightening, and the IMF is aware that the imbalances built up over the past five years - high levels of debt, an overvalued stock market, a record current account deficit - could unwind dangerously fast. </p> <p>\"The outlook remains subject to considerable uncertainty and a deeper and more prolonged downturn is clearly possible. Against this background, macroeconomic policies - particularly on the monetary side - will need to be proactive to guard against the possibility of a steeper than expected downturn.\" </p> <p>Again, this may need translating. Stripped of the jargon, it means the IMF fears that come September, it may be force to downgrade its forecasts again - and that the best bulwark against that would be further cuts in global interest rates for those who have already taken action, and for the European Central Bank to wake up to the potential seriousness of the problem. </p> <p>Just in case Wim Duisenberg and his colleagues in Frankfurt failed to get the message, Mr Mussa spelt it out at yesterday's press conference for the world economic outlook's publication. He said the eurozone needed to \"be part of the solution, rather than part of the problem\", and should have cut rates a month ago. </p> <p>These are tricky times for the global economy. Differences between the EU and the US over trade mean there is a rapidly diminishing chance of a new round of trade liberalisation talks commencing in Qatar this autumn. </p> <p>The economic superpowers on either side of the Atlantic seem to be retreating into their own trading blocs. The fact that the ECB is taking such a hard line on interest rates will only make matters worse, since it adds to the feeling in the US that the Europeans are happy to criticise the US for failing to show global leadership over the environment, but are unwilling to take a lead themselves when it comes to underpinning the growth prospects of the global economy. </p> <p>The IMF is right. There is no reason why the world should suffer a recession - provided the right expansionary policies are followed. The ECB stands alone in its belief that inflation is a bigger threat than recession. In Frankfurt, this is seen as principled independence.

Tony Blair lined up three of his cabinet colleagues for a Downing Street press conference to launch what will - if implemented after the coming general election and widespread consultation - be one of Labour's most far-sighted and idealistic proposals. It seeks to ensure that every child enjoys the benefits of savings and inheritance that middle and upper class families take for granted: by introducing both tax free bonds for newborns, which would be topped up over 18 or 21 years to maturity, and a \"savings gateway\" account - in which government would match individual savings pound for pound. Mr Blair presented the scheme as the fourth strand of Labour's post-1997 welfare reforms after improving skills and job opportunities; raising living standards for the worst off; and modernising public services. He called it \"more people getting the benefit of assets and savings.\" Mr Blair said it was a \"financial springboard\" to a meritocratic society - where people had a fair chance to exercise their talents. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, who hopes to announce the full scheme in his 2002 budget, said it opened \"saving and wealth ownership to all\". But the education and employment secretary, David Blunket, grabbed the day's snappiest soundbite after expressing his wish to restore the old working class habits of thrift, reliance and mutual support - embodied through friendly societies and the co-op movement. \"We are replacing 'on your bike' with 'on your tandem',\" he said - with the government helping individuals from the back seat. As reported in yesterday's Guardian the scheme would, subject to detailed discussion with interested parties, provide the New Labour equivalent of a \"trust fund babe\". Every child born after an agreed date, not before April 2003 at the earliest, would get \u00a3500 at birth, topped up with an extra \u00a3100 at five, 11 and 16. The children of better-off families would get half that sum, though ministers are said to believe that making it payable universally is the safest way to protect the scheme from being abolished when the Conservatives next win power. Yesterday the rightwing Adam Smith Institute claimed authorship of the idea, as did the Fabian Society and the IPPR think tanks on the left. But the left fears that the right will seek to gut the scheme or use it to substitute for existing welfare benefits - most obviously for student loans which many 18-year-olds would be seeking just as their funds mature. The \u00a3800 version alone would generate \u00a31,600 in real terms by the age of 18, though a modest family top-up of \u00a35 a month - from parents, uncles or grandparents - plus interest could more than double it. Mr Blair sees it as a down payment on a mortgage, a business or training. Alistair Darling, the social security secretary, later stressed that - as with pensions and Isa savings rules - the system would be policed to prevent abuse of tax-free benefits, though policy-makers admit it will be hard to enforce once the money becomes payable. The savings gateway would allow parents who put aside a modest amount - say \u00a325 a month - to have their funds matched by the government up to a time limit of 3-4 years and a capped total. The idea is that the scheme dovetails with Isas and stakeholder pensions - which ministers are also keen to encourage among the lower-paid as part of a \"savings\" culture. Poverty lobbyists welcomed the plan as a bold first step, though some would like the \u00a31bn it will cost - Mr Brown refused to provide a figure - spent on more urgent poverty via the social fund. Ministers say it is establishing a principle. But the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, said it was giving back to poor people a portion of the extra taxes they have paid - and it was \"frankly insulting\" to expect them to be grateful.",

If you come out exhilarated rather than exhausted, it is because director Michael Boyd and his RSC team offer infinitely more than a carnage-and- cutlery chronicle; instead they offer a consistent vision that embraces all four plays. </p> <p>And what exactly is that vision? Partly that the plays are meditations on time, in which the past permeates the historic present. You see this in the ghostly ubiquity of the dead, culminating in the extraordinary climax when the slaughtered Richard and the suffering Henry VI, apparent polar opposites, confront each other in perverse kinship. But Boyd also matches image to language in a way that makes nonsense of the false division between \"text-based\" and \"visual\" theatre. From myriad moments, the one that lingers is when the militant Talbot, having compared his son to Icarus, sees his offspring's lifeless body winched tragically skywards. </p> <p>Above all, Boyd sees the plays in terms of politics rather than theology - not simply as the working out of a curse on the house of Lancaster, but as a study of power in action. And this inevitably affects Richard III. In isolation, the play becomes an individualistic study of a satanic joker. But when you see Aidan McArdle's Richard of Gloucester developing from Henry VI Part Three, it becomes something entirely different: a continuation of his late father's throne-lust and an extension of the de facto approach to power. </p> <p>I wouldn't deny that there have been many Richards, from Olivier to Antony Sher, who have been more charismatically evil. What McArdle offers is a puckish, bustling, cerebral Richard who plots his route to the throne like a conscienceless chessmaster methodically eliminating the obstructive pieces. Boyd and McArdle don't exculpate Richard; what they make clear is that he is an outsider (\"misshapen Dick\") whose deformity has been a lifelong source of mockery and who has grown up in a corrupt ethos of insatiate crown-hunger. One touch brilliantly shows this. Clive Wood's Duke of York earlier illustrates his claim to kingship with the aid of a bag of stones; McArdle's Richard pathetically produces the self-same stones at the very moment he is to lose both power and life. </p> <p>Echoes and reverberations are the key to Boyd's magnificently unified vision of the tetralogy. The bond between fathers and sons is a constant refrain embodied throughout with despairing tenderness by Keith Bartlett and Sam Troughton. Female militancy is an equally powerful thread, seen in Fiona Bell's astonishing double of Joan la Pucelle and Queen Margaret, and Deirdra Morris's angry Duchess of York. But possibly the strongest theme is the insecure isolation of monarchy - which is what links David Oyelowo's physically weak but morally strong Henry VI to McArdle's obsessive but defeated Richard. </p> <p>The pervading unity is richly enhanced by Tom Piper's design, Heather Carson's lighting and James Jones's music, which compound the sense that one is watching a collaborative vision of national chaos.

      "body": "<p>ly parking itself on the wall of Kent-based packaging firm Crest early this week would have noticed that something seemed to be troubling the workers. Staff gathered furtively in corners to discuss some pressing topic and there was dissent in the air. \u00d2The attitude here is somewhat mutinous,\u00d3 one angry employee told Jobs &amp; Money this week. \u00d2There are lots of very unhappy and worried people here.\u00d3 Some might be surprised to learn that the issue causing so much consternation was the company\u00d5s pension scheme \u00d1 a topic not usually known for its capacity to dramatically stir up people\u00d5s emotions. This week Crest closed down its generous final salary company pension scheme \u00d1 where staff are guaranteed a certain level of pension benefits at retirement \u00d1 and replaced it with a money purchase stakeholder scheme, a type of arrangement which offers no such guarantees and leaves them more vulnerable to the whims of the stock market. \u00d2I think \u00d4kick in the nuts\u00d5 is an expression I could use,\u00d3 says the employee. \u00d2You look around and there are huddles of people and all they are talking about is pensions.\u00d3 Crest, which makes the packaging for products as diverse as Mr Kipling cakes and Linda McCartney frozen vegetarian meals, isn\u00d5t the only company that is tampering with its pension arrangements. Supermarket giant Tesco and business services group Hays are just two of the big-name employers making changes to their company pension schemes which could result in some of their workers losing out, it was revealed this week. Last Saturday Jobs &amp; Money told how BT has just closed its final salary company pension scheme to new entrants. All new employees will only be able to join a money purchase scheme. We asked readers to contact us if their employer had closed its final salary scheme to new entrants or had made other changes that they were concerned about \u00d1 and we got a huge response. Extracts from some of the emails we received are on the right. Many pension experts say final salary (aka defined benefit) schemes offer workers a better deal because they guarantee to pay a pension related to your earnings and length of service at or near retirement. With money purchase (aka defined contribution) schemes, the value of the pension you get when you retire is determined by how much is paid in, investment performance and annuity rates. Switching to a money purchase scheme enables an employer to cut its costs and in effect pass the burden of risk over to the employee. Hays, which employs around 13,000 people in the UK, is doing the same thing as BT. It closed its final salary scheme to most new entrants earlier this year and is bringing in a new money purchase scheme. As was the case with the old scheme, eligible employees will receive pension contributions from Hays on top of what they themselves put in. Provided the employee puts in 2% of their pay, Hays\u00d5s contribution will be 2% for the first two years and 3% after that, though you can put in additional contributions which will also attract extra cash from Hays. This doesn\u00d5t seem to compare well with what some of those staff in the final salary scheme get \u00d1 they contribute 4% of their pay with the employer putting in around 11%, says one Hays employee who contacted Jobs &amp; Money. The company denies the move is designed to save money but says it will make its pension costs more \u00d2predictable\u00d3. Literature being sent out to Hays employees states that money purchase schemes \u00d2are in part a response to changing career patterns ...[and] can work better for people who have several employers during their working lives\u00d3. This is the typical defence given by companies when they make the switch. What they don\u00d5t of course mention is that industry research has found that employers tend to put less money into money purchase schemes. And consulting actuaries Lane Clark &amp; Peacock warns that the move away from traditional final salary schemes towards money purchase means \u00d2increased uncertainty and volatility for the employee, who is far less able to bear the risks of stock market fluctuations than large companies\u00d3. Tesco, which employs 169,000 people in the UK, recently unveiled a major \u00d2modernisation\u00d3 of its pension provision which came into effect this month. A lot of what it is doing is good, but below the surface lurk hazards which employees should be aware of. Tesco has just closed its final salary company pension scheme to new employees and has made a new scheme available which is similar to a final salary arrangement but where the pension you eventually get is based on your average earnings, not your pay just before retirement. The plusses are that, unusually, the new scheme is available to all employees, whether full-time, part-time or temporary. And if you\u00d5re a Tesco employee who works full-time for much of your working life and then goes part-time towards the end, this sort of scheme could actually offer you a better deal than the old final salary one. But the opposite is also true: if you\u00d5re a long-term employee who is promoted later in your career, the fact that your pension isn\u00d5t based on your final salary could make you a loser. Critically, the new scheme is linked to price inflation whereas if you\u00d5re in a final salary scheme each bit of pension you accrue gets bumped up in line with earnings inflation. This is bad news for some Tesco workers joining the new scheme. \u00d2For those employees who do have a long and full career, the pension earned in the early years could end up being less than half of what a final pay scheme would have given for those same years,\u00d3 says employee benefits consultancy William M Mercer. </p>",

German producer prices, a key indicator of future consumer inflation, hit a 19-year high of 4.9% in March. Two-year bond prices slipped immediately after the ECB announcement, with the yield rising 1.8 basis points to 4.484%. The 10-year bund future held steady, however. \"They're [the ECB] not going to be frightened into making any early rate cut,\" said David Brown, an economist at Bear Stearns in London. The IMF said supported the two cuts in interest rates this year from the Bank of England, adding that with inflation subdued there was room for further easing if \"the growth outlook were to deteriorate further\". It shaved its forecast for UK growth this year from 2.8% to 2.6%, noting that the UK was more vulnerable than the eurozone to external events.",

Route one was clearly the path Ireland needed to follow to improve their goal difference. In Niall Quinn's enforced absence, Doherty proved an able replacement. He constantly won set-pieces and there were early second-half chances for Kinsella, whose low shot was superbly turned around the post, and David Connolly, who deflected a Breen shot and forced the recovering goalkeeper into another piece of sure handling. Republic of Ireland (4-4-2) Given; G Kelly, Breen (Staunton, 85min), Dunne, Harte; Kennedy, Kinsella (Finnan, 79), Holland, Kilbane; Doherty, Connolly. Andorra (4-5-1) Alfonso Sanchez; Escura, I Lima, T Lima, Jonas; Luena, Gonzalez (Soria, 87), Ruiz, Sonejee, Jimenez (Pujol, 80); Juli Sanchez (Fernandez, 90). Referee : K Jakobson (Iceland). \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to football.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk",

If they entered this territory, they used simple terms like near or close. If lawyers, they were just as likely to use a term like adjoin or abut - a word you rarely hear nowadays pronounced by people who do not have documents with them.</p> <p>Yet suddenly the word \"contiguous\" is on everyone's lips. This is mostly down to Phoenix, the cuddly soft-eyed calf, which this week melted the hearts of a nation and by all appearances the heart of the prime minister's press secretary too.</p> <p>Contiguous culling was the doctrine that so nearly put Phoenix to death. Therefore, contiguity matters.</p> <p>But what does it mean? That is rarely explained. The newscasters and reporters who let it slip off their tongues in bulletins, the pundits who so gaily toss it about, never stop to define it.</p> <p>Producers who allow its use on Sky News do not flash up a subtitle usefully telling their audience what the word \"contiguous\" means. Maybe only those, a dwindling breed, who once went through a classical education, would grasp its meaning immediately. Yet to them the meaning is very simple. It comes from the Latin and means: to touch with.</p> <p>Collins English dictionary says: <br>\u0095 touching along the side or boundary; in contact<br>\u0095 physically adjacent, neighbouring<br>\u0095 preceding or following in time</p> <p>Longman's says: <br>\u0095 in actual contact, touching along a boundary, or at a point<br> \u0095 (of two angles) adjacent<br>\u0095 next or near in time or sequence</p> <p>Chambers has: <br>\u0095 touching, adjoining<br>\u0095 near</p> <p>By another route, the latin \"con-\" and \"tangere\" (to touch) give us the word contingent.</p> <p>Sometimes when a word enters popular language it lodges there; sometimes it enjoys its moment of fame and then quietly fades away.</p> <p>Since the man one has now come to think of as Robin Cooka Masala made his controversial remarks on race, fierce delight has been taken in dragging tikka masala into contexts where you would not normally hear it. That will not last.</p> <p>However, other speech habits stick. Using, for example, \"I went\" instead of \"I said\", which grates on the ears of anyone over 40, is now an ineradicable practice.</p> <p>Whether the mass employment of \"contiguous\" sticks will depend on how many everyday contexts it can now be employed in. Will people cease, for instance, to refer to \"my neighbours\" and say instead \"the family that we're contiguous with\"? Probably not.</p> <p>Will cricket pundits describe lbw appeals as \"pretty contiguous\" instead of \"pretty adjacent\"? Perhaps.</p> <p>Will civil servants defend some evasive answer on the grounds that what they are saying is \"contiguous with the truth?\" Very likely.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it is not a word to be generally recommended. For, as George Orwell taught, a short, simple word is invariably to be preferred to a cumbersome, pompous one. The word \"contiguous\" is no more inherently cumbersome and pompous than the word \"continuous\", which long ago came into every day use.</p> <p>But if children come back from school next week describing the friends with whom their desks are contiguous, rather than just next door to, please don't encourage them.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a

Collins English dictionary says: \u0095 touching along the side or boundary; in contact \u0095 physically adjacent, neighbouring \u0095 preceding or following in time Longman's says: \u0095 in actual contact, touching along a boundary, or at a point \u0095 (of two angles) adjacent \u0095 next or near in time or sequence Chambers has: \u0095 touching, adjoining \u0095 near By another route, the latin \"con-\" and \"tangere\" (to touch) give us the word contingent. Sometimes when a word enters popular language it lodges there; sometimes it enjoys its moment of fame and then quietly fades away. Since the man one has now come to think of as Robin Cooka Masala made his controversial remarks on race, fierce delight has been taken in dragging tikka masala into contexts where you would not normally hear it. That will not last. However, other speech habits stick. Using, for example, \"I went\" instead of \"I said\", which grates on the ears of anyone over 40, is now an ineradicable practice. Whether the mass employment of \"contiguous\" sticks will depend on how many everyday contexts it can now be employed in. Will people cease, for instance, to refer to \"my neighbours\" and say instead \"the family that we're contiguous with\"? Probably not. Will cricket pundits describe lbw appeals as \"pretty contiguous\" instead of \"pretty adjacent\"? Perhaps. Will civil servants defend some evasive answer on the grounds that what they are saying is \"contiguous with the truth?\" Very likely. Nevertheless, it is not a word to be generally recommended. For, as George Orwell taught, a short, simple word is invariably to be preferred to a cumbersome, pompous one. The word \"contiguous\" is no more inherently cumbersome and pompous than the word \"continuous\", which long ago came into every day use. But if children come back from school next week describing the friends with whom their desks are contiguous, rather than just next door to, please don't encourage them.

      "body": "<p>The Screen Actors' Guild, the US union to which most film stars belong, is poised to go on strike in June. But one summer release may be pioneering the way to make future thespian walkouts an irrelevance. </p> <p>Final Fantasy, due to reach UK screens in August, uses state-of-the-art virtual actors - sometimes known as vactors, or synthespians. The film, a science-fiction thriller set in 2065, has been entirely computer-generated by animation specialist Square. Flesh and blood actors contribute just basic movement data, and voicing. </p> <p>But anyone hoping to be convinced by the female lead, Aki Ross, is likely to be disappointed. A preview last week in London showed that \"she\" may look more human than most characters of software born, but there's still something wrong. Her skin and eyes look lifeless, and when she runs, her movements are somehow too smooth. </p> <p>Some of these problems also affect Eve Solal, a computer-generated character produced by Parisian animator Attitude Studio. In stills - such as \"her\" recent cover shoot for women's magazine Madame Figaro - Solal looks disconcertingly real. But in a short video interview, available on her website, she doesn't quite convince. </p> <p>This is because, when computer animators try to simulate human life, they are trying to trick one of our brain's most reliable processes. \"There is a disproportionate amount of mental capacity used for dealing with faces,\" says Dr Donald Laming, lecturer in experimental psychology at Cambridge University. \"If the face isn't quite right, it's not going to work.\" </p> <p>The brains behind Solal and Ross know they aren't quite there - yet. \"Her face is a bit plastic, and her eyes move a little bit too much,\" says R\u00e9my Brun, motion capture director at Attitude, of Solal. </p> <p>Jun Aida, producer of Final Fantasy and president of Hawaiian-based studio Square, agrees. \"Our goal was not to create photo-real characters. I don't think technically it's possible with animation. In still photos, we can.\" He sees his film as creating a new category of high-quality animation, rather than as a challenge to live-action movies. </p> <p>Virtual actors are not even a cheap alternative to the real thing. Aida says the 60,000 hairs on Ross's head took a fifth of Square's graphic rendering capacity to produce. \"She ended up costing us millions of dollars,\" he says. \"We should have given her shorter hair.\" The resulting hairdo, although one of the more realistic things about Ross, does tend to make her look as if she's just stepped out of the salon even when cheating death - but perhaps that's a screen siren's prerogative. </p> <p>Despite the difficulty in creating faces, realistic body movements are at least as tricky. In Final Fantasy, producers used a technique called motion capture. This involves real people performing the required actions, such as running or walking, while wearing sensors spread around their bodies. Cameras track the sensors, then map them on to the virtual actor. </p> <p>But using this process to create convincing movement is fiendishly difficult, according to Chris Ford, senior product manager for Alias Wavefront's Maya, the software used by many firms to handle three-dimensional models. \"Motion capture is true to life, but it is sampled data,\" says Ford. \"It's a bit like digital versus analogue [sound].\" Motion-captured movements often look odd as a result of poor sampling. </p> <p>With Solal, Attitude has got closer than most to convincing human movement, by basing almost all her actions on those of an actress of a similar build; Final Fantasy's animators, by contrast, have used actors only to model action sequences. \"We chose the actress as we would for theatre or cinema,\" says Brun. \"Often, people use their friends, but acting is 50% of the movement.\" Brun uses 12 cameras running Vicon, a system from UK firm Oxford Metrics, and his eight years of experience in the field, which he describes as \"very high-tech puppetry\". </p> <p>Some animators are experimenting with virtual animals. Although in some respects more difficult - fur or hair is notoriously hard to get right - our eyes are less attuned to any imperfections, and also, the results will often be impossible to obtain in real life. Viewers of the latest surreal Guinness television ad may have noticed the appearance of a group of squirrels, who talk and quaff glasses of the black stuff. They are computer-generated. </p> <p>Sally Goldberg is head of creature animation for Computer Film Company, one of several Soho firms working in this area. She is also virtual mother of the Guinness squirrels. \"We built them from scratch,\" she says. This is unusual, as three-dimensional characters are often designed from a template, such as with the firm's work on Eyes Wide Shut (see box). </p> <p>Goldberg filmed squirrels from an animal rescue centre, and then translated their movements into the three-dimensional models used in the ad. \"When he sat there and held a nut, he looked just like he was drinking beer,\" she says, of the squirrel she based the main character on. </p> <p>It is already possible to fill the screen with computer-generated humans and convince the eye - if you're using thousands of virtual actors, rather than one close up. Mill Film, a few hundred yards south of Computer Film Company, last month won an Oscar for its work on Gladiator, which included a 50,000-strong virtual Roman crowd - an obvious moneysaver for the production company. </p> <p>It is partly financial concerns that hold back use of virtual actors as leads. \"If money's no object, it's possible now,\" claims Dave Throssell, a head of computer animation at Mill. \"But I'd ask, 'are you sure?' You want a real person, then there's thousands of them outside this window.\" He adds that computer generating an actor for a whole film would be expensive even compared to a star demanding $20m. </p> <p>And then there's the Lara Croft effect. Virtual characters to date have been not so much Final Fantasy as Unrealistic Male Fantasy. The somewhat top-heavy star of the Tomb Raider games has recently been joined by two similarly shaped virtual pop stars, TMmy and T-Babe, created by Glaswegian animators. \"Most people who sit in front of computers tend to be male, and that's what they think about 24 hours a day,\" Throssell points out. </p> <p>Attitude's Brun says Eve Solal was deliberately designed to break this stereotype. \"She's 1.62 metres [5ft4in], which is quite short, so she's not a top model. She's good-looking in a way, but she's not Pamela Anderson, or Lara Croft,\" Brun says. </p> <p>The French studio is, however, trying to perfect elements such as Solal's skin, in its quest to make the character more convincing. But it may be a long task. \"In the history of painting, it took several hundred years for artists to learn how to paint in three dimensions, and to draw the human figure and face,\" says Cambridge's Dr Laming, adding that science doesn't yet fully understand how we read each others' body language. \"It's as if computer animators are in the position of those early artists.\" </p> <p>Final Fantasy preview <a href=\"http://www.finalfantasy-themovie.co.uk/\">www.finalfantasy-themovie.co.uk</a> </p> <p>Attitude Studio's virtual creation <a href=\"http://www.evesolal.com\">www.evesolal.com</a> </p> <p>Guiness site, includes stills from the new ad &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.guinness.ie/\"\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.guinness.ie </p> <p>Computer Film Company's home page &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.cfc.co.uk/\"\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.cfc.co.uk </p> <p>Vew the basic models used by experts &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.viewpoint.com/\"\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.viewpoint.com </p> <p>Mill Film's site <strong> <a href=\"http://www.mill.co.uk\">www.mill.co.uk/</a></strong> </p> <p>Virtual pop-singer T-Babe... &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.glasgowrecords.com/tbabe.htm\"\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.glasgowrecords.com/tbabe.htm </p> <p>...and fellow Scot Tmmy <a href=\"http://www.tmmy.co.uk\">www.tmmy.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Too many volunteering organisations are in competition with each other, which is weakening the sector's influence on government policy, according to the chief executive of a high profile national campaign. John Rafferty, of the TimeBank volunteering initiative, said organisations such as the National Association of Volunteer Bureaux, the National Centre for Volunteering and others are often competing for grants from the same funders and there was a lack of collaboration on lobbying. Mr Rafferty said: \"There is no clear, unequivocal voice for volunteering [at government level] and the winners are the bureaucrats.\" The sector now has a prime minister, chancellor, cabinet office minister and home office minister all apparently committed to promoting volunteering, he said, but without a single voice to express the views of volunteering agencies, the sector had not influenced policy sufficiently. Also speaking at the Charityfair 2001 seminar, Directory of Social Change director Mike Eastwood said he was concerned that when the prime minister gave examples of volunteering the government wanted to encourage, he focused on several activities not necessarily related to the voluntary sector, such as the territorial army and adults helping children to read. If extra funds for volunteering were not to end up in health or education budgets the voluntary sector would have to improve its lobbying skills, said Mr Eastwood. Mr Rafferty added: \"With many volunteering organisations bidding for the same funds it is hard to build a consensus, let alone joint working, but that's exactly what we need.\" The way ahead was not mergers, he added, but some form of volunteering alliance that could set the agenda for government initiatives and become the natural group for ministers to consult when considering changes. He said he was concerned about the lack of leadership in the sector at a crucial time, on the brink of a general election: \"Now is the time to look at why we're here and how we can move forward.\" Volunteering also suffered from a lack of coherent and visible marketing, argued Mr Rafferty, suggesting that a single brand and logo, such as TimeBank, could make it easier to communicate with the public. \"TimeBank has only been going a year but there's already high public recognition of the brand,\" he said, adding that the volunteering sector could benefit from a single brand and logo, similar to that for legal aid. TimeBank, he said, was \"the marketing department for volunteering\" and could exploit its high profile to play a wider publicity role for volunteering generally. Mr Rafferty highlighted research carried out by TimeBank into placing volunteers, he said it suggested a dramatic difference between potential volunteers who were simply sent information about volunteering by TimeBank and those that the organisation managed to put in touch with local volunteer coordinators. TimeBank took samples from its 15,000 registered volunteers and found that 15% of those that had been sent information had actually volunteered but that number soared to 39% of those that had been put in touch with a volunteer coordinator in a local charity. \"That suggests there is a big need for more resources to be channelled to existing volunteering practitioners,\" he said. Mr Rafferty referred to Gordon Brown's \u00a3300m boost to volunteering announced in January, which included \u00a320m for a \"new experience corps\" to promote volunteering among older people and \u00a360m on modernisation of volunteering. There had been concerns from some in the sector about how the new experience corps would operate, he said, adding that it was still unclear what the \u00a360m modernisation fund would actually be spent on. These uncertainties only underlined how important it was for the volunteering sector to able to speak with one voice to government, he said, so that initiatives flowed from consultation with those in volunteering rather than being imposed on them by ministers and civil servants.",

It's not a phrase we have ever used.\" The 15 new life peers are: \u0095 Sir Paul Condon, former commissioner of the Metropolitan police \u0095 Sir Herman Ouseley, former executive chairman and chief executive of the Commission for Racial Equality \u0095 Victor Adebowale, chief executive of Centrepoint \u0095 Richard Best, director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation \u0095 Amir Bhatia, businessman \u0095 Sir John Browne, group chief executive of BP Amoco \u0095 Professor Michael Chan, a paediatrician \u0095 Professor Ilora Finlay, a world expert in palliative medicine and vice-dean of the School of Medicine, University of Wales College of Medicine \u0095 Professor Susan Greenfield, director of the Royal Institute of Great Britain \u0095 Sir David Hannay, a former diplomat \u0095 Valerie Howarth, chief executive of Childline \u0095 Lady (Elspeth) Howe of Aberavon, a former chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Commission \u0095 Sir Robert May, president of the Royal Society \u0095 Sir Claus Moser, a former professor of statistics at the London School of Economics and former head of the government statistical service \u0095 Sir Stewart Sutherland, a leading figure of the field of education. The perks of the job are: \u0095 Life membership to the 'most exclusive club in the country' \u0095 A working week often running from Tuesday to Thursday \u0095 \u00a384 accommodation allowance a night, \u00a337 a day for meals and taxis and \u00a3 36 towards a secretary and postage \u0095 Free first class rail or air travel \u0095 A generous allowance of 52.5p a mile \u0095 Use of five luxurious bars and restaurants, including the Peers' dining room, the bishop's bar, the Attlee room, the home room and the Barry room \u0095 Free gym membership \u0095 Use of the Westminster shooting range.

Listeners may well feel threatened or criticised by the speakers, and to combat this, they make people laugh.</p> <p>\"Laughter works because it allows the audience to affiliate with the speaker, to generate a rapport, without automatically suggesting they are taking the underlying point on board. They feel less pinned down.\"</p> <p>Dr Greatbatch and Dr Clark applied to the Economic and Social Reserch Council (ESRC) for funding for their research in 1998 because they felt that the work of management gurus affected not only management practice, but, through a drip-down effect, also the working lives of a large section of the population. \"Very little work had been done on what we perceived to be a very important area,\" said Dr Greatbatch. \"I'm sure that that was one of the reasons our proposal was successful.\"</p> <p>The duo also feel that their \u00a333,000 application, which covered expenses and replacement teaching costs, was accepted because they had already secured access to resources and contacts.</p> <p>Dr Greatbactch said: \"Prior to the application we secured access to about \u00a330,000 worth of video footage which we wanted to carefully go through and analyse. When making an application I think it is vital to demonstrate that what you're proposing is do-able. It also helped us that our methodological approach - looking at videos of real interaction in a management context - was innovative.\"</p> <p>The project is now officially complete, and the researchers now intend to further their investigations into the relationship between public speeches and laughter by turning their attention to politicians. \"We can't assume it'll be the same story there,\" said Dr Greatbatch. \"Politicians may well use humour for an entirely different purpose.\"</p>",

They feel less pinned down.\" Dr Greatbatch and Dr Clark applied to the Economic and Social Reserch Council (ESRC) for funding for their research in 1998 because they felt that the work of management gurus affected not only management practice, but, through a drip-down effect, also the working lives of a large section of the population. \"Very little work had been done on what we perceived to be a very important area,\" said Dr Greatbatch. \"I'm sure that that was one of the reasons our proposal was successful.\" The duo also feel that their \u00a333,000 application, which covered expenses and replacement teaching costs, was accepted because they had already secured access to resources and contacts. Dr Greatbactch said: \"Prior to the application we secured access to about \u00a330,000 worth of video footage which we wanted to carefully go through and analyse. When making an application I think it is vital to demonstrate that what you're proposing is do-able. It also helped us that our methodological approach - looking at videos of real interaction in a management context - was innovative.\" The project is now officially complete, and the researchers now intend to further their investigations into the relationship between public speeches and laughter by turning their attention to politicians. \"We can't assume it'll be the same story there,\" said Dr Greatbatch. \"Politicians may well use humour for an entirely different purpose.\"",

What does it matter what I say about her new solo show at White Cube2, given this level of celebrity? All the things that are irritating about the rent-a-quote, self-dramatising person I watched having a bizarrely hateful conflict with John Humphreys on Have I Got News For You at the weekend were in my mind as I followed the ridiculously huge press crowd into the gallery, to be instantly charmed by a show as gentle as it is extravagant, as disciplined as it is passionate. </p> <p>Birds caw around a lifesize rotting wooden helter-skelter and by the dunes there's a mad little garden with a birdhouse on stilts that you climb up a ladder to peer into. Nearby, a mother and daughter are discussing why the mother doesn't think her child should have a child. You can taste the salty air, hear the rattles and shrieks of the ghost train. Emin has already excavated her Margate past as ruthlessly as a gull sucking out a crab's insides. You would have thought that after all the revelations and confessions she'd be a bit lost for words by now. The memories would have dried up, the stories withered on the vine. Perhaps they have, because her new work is more visual and less explicit than any before. Instead of stopping you like the Ancient Mariner and telling you about the lousy week she spent in her rancid bed, she takes you on a more winding path. </p> <p>The central fact of this show is the helter-skelter whose spiralling slide towers over everything. It's creaky, gothic, mysterious. As she elaborates in a blanket work that describes her life as \"Hellter fucking skelter\", Emin portrays herself as lost in the funfair, both in her life as a celeb and in her relationships. \"You see it's a spirial (sic) which goes down.\" Scary, fragmented insults, sewn in radically distinct shapes and colours, accuse people of envy, plead \"But I love you\". But they don't exhaust the image of the helter-skelter; you don't feel it has all been said. It is not confession. It's art. </p> <p>There is nothing unmediated about Emin's art. Like any successful contemporary artist, she has assistants, fabricators. She wasn't up all hours with a hammer, nailing that slide together. She was too busy appearing on Have I Got News For You. Pure self-expression is, in any case, an impossibility in art. As Ernst Gombrich pointed out in a famous essay on the fallacy of expressionism, all art draws on pre-existing visual schemata; artists do not see the world like Miranda in The Tempest but through previous art. Even Turner began by pastiching Claude. </p> <p>The trouble with Emin, made manifest in her Turner Prize showing, is that she can seem naive about the pitfalls of expressionism to a degree that brings her to the brink of being a really bad artist. Recently she published a self-indulgent article in the Times about her relationship with Munch's The Scream. She seemed to claim a kind of divine communion with it without considering that the painting might be an aesthetic masterpiece, a work of art that communicates through line and colour. She talks about My Bed as if it was the first time anyone had ever thought of doing it, but there is a long history of artists exhibiting their beds: Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Gober and Felix Gonzales-Torres have made poetical bed art. So it's not a pure statement at all, but a mannerist one. </p> <p>Here, however, Emin emerges as an artist, not just a callow diarist. There's a generous imagination at work here that doesn't instantly translate itself into words. Even the words don't instantly translate themselves into words. Her marriage of rhetoric and dyslexia can be playful as well as furious. \"May Day, Be Day, D Day,\" she's scrawled under a sketch of a woman on the bog. Next to a naked woman whose scribbly body sits alone on the white page, she writes, \"It's just an idea of space\". </p> <p>There's a delicacy in a series of little drawings of birds, rough and rapid. Emin juxtaposes her sketched sparrows with the words she imagines them speaking. \"Shall we go to bed?\" asks one. \"I've done that better than I thought I would,\" another congratulates itself, fat on a nice worm. Emin has broken out of the neo- minimalist, ironic conventions of contemporary art to find a voice that is not afraid of emotion or poetry. If it sometimes grates, here it sings. </p> <p>Nearby is Concorde smothered in newspaper, stuck on a pole; the plane that once symbolised perfect flight has become an image of failure, crashing in flames. It's not surprising that as the most famous \"young\" artist in Britain, even more famous than Damien Hirst because she's good on telly, Emin should be full of thoughts of her own destiny - according to the crude narratives of modern fame - which is to crash and burn. But she avoids that narrative cliche by complicating her art. The oddest, most delightful thing in this show is a fantasy dwelling that could have come straight out of Dickens, inhabited by some Mr Cheeribottom eccentric. It's a little wooden contraption on stilts standing over a flower bed, and you climb up a rickety wooden ladder to look in through a tiny peephole. Inside, on video but so close it feels real, a jolly fat man - I think her father - comes towards you bearing a big red flower, which he pushes into your face. </p> <p>At this point those art historical ghosts return. Emin's peepshow recalls the most celebrated peepshow in art, Marcel Duchamp's Etant Donn\u00e9s, the work he spent his last years making. Duchamp's installation invites you to press your eye to a hole in a wooden door, through which you see a naked woman, her legs splayed. Duchamp plays a cruel trick on us. Emin's peepshow appears to be a riposte. Instead of something nasty, she gives us something nice. </p> <p>The return to childhood is more troubling when you sit on a child-sized wooden chair to listen to her mother telling her why she's not cut out for motherhood. Her art is characterised by its texture, the rough-hewn quality of expressionism with a ritualistic use of materials and motifs; blankets, wood, drawings. This is reminiscent of Joseph Beuys, who declared that \"the silence of Marcel Duchamp is overrated.\" Emin is like Beuys in other ways. They both talk nonsense and draw beautifully - the structures and shapes in this show feel like drawings translated into three dimensions. And like Beuys, you can dismiss her as a woolly-minded fraud or hail her as a poet. It depends what side of bed you get out of in the morning. Perhaps the polluted Shoreditch air was depriving my brain of oxygen, but I inclined to the poet side. </p> <p>\u0095 Tracey Emin: You Forgot To Kiss My Soul opens at White Cube2, London N1 (020-7930 5373) tomorrow and runs till May 26.</p>",

There's a generous imagination at work here that doesn't instantly translate itself into words. Even the words don't instantly translate themselves into words. Her marriage of rhetoric and dyslexia can be playful as well as furious. \"May Day, Be Day, D Day,\" she's scrawled under a sketch of a woman on the bog. Next to a naked woman whose scribbly body sits alone on the white page, she writes, \"It's just an idea of space\". There's a delicacy in a series of little drawings of birds, rough and rapid. Emin juxtaposes her sketched sparrows with the words she imagines them speaking. \"Shall we go to bed?\" asks one. \"I've done that better than I thought I would,\" another congratulates itself, fat on a nice worm. Emin has broken out of the neo- minimalist, ironic conventions of contemporary art to find a voice that is not afraid of emotion or poetry. If it sometimes grates, here it sings. Nearby is Concorde smothered in newspaper, stuck on a pole; the plane that once symbolised perfect flight has become an image of failure, crashing in flames. It's not surprising that as the most famous \"young\" artist in Britain, even more famous than Damien Hirst because she's good on telly, Emin should be full of thoughts of her own destiny - according to the crude narratives of modern fame - which is to crash and burn. But she avoids that narrative cliche by complicating her art. The oddest, most delightful thing in this show is a fantasy dwelling that could have come straight out of Dickens, inhabited by some Mr Cheeribottom eccentric. It's a little wooden contraption on stilts standing over a flower bed, and you climb up a rickety wooden ladder to look in through a tiny peephole. Inside, on video but so close it feels real, a jolly fat man - I think her father - comes towards you bearing a big red flower, which he pushes into your face. At this point those art historical ghosts return. Emin's peepshow recalls the most celebrated peepshow in art, Marcel Duchamp's Etant Donn\u00e9s, the work he spent his last years making. Duchamp's installation invites you to press your eye to a hole in a wooden door, through which you see a naked woman, her legs splayed. Duchamp plays a cruel trick on us. Emin's peepshow appears to be a riposte. Instead of something nasty, she gives us something nice. The return to childhood is more troubling when you sit on a child-sized wooden chair to listen to her mother telling her why she's not cut out for motherhood. Her art is characterised by its texture, the rough-hewn quality of expressionism with a ritualistic use of materials and motifs; blankets, wood, drawings. This is reminiscent of Joseph Beuys, who declared that \"the silence of Marcel Duchamp is overrated.\" Emin is like Beuys in other ways. They both talk nonsense and draw beautifully - the structures and shapes in this show feel like drawings translated into three dimensions. And like Beuys, you can dismiss her as a woolly-minded fraud or hail her as a poet. It depends what side of bed you get out of in the morning. Perhaps the polluted Shoreditch air was depriving my brain of oxygen, but I inclined to the poet side. \u0095 Tracey Emin: You Forgot To Kiss My Soul opens at White Cube2, London N1 (020-7930 5373) tomorrow and runs till May 26.",

Instead of blooming in January, they are now flowering a whole month early, in December. She is not the only one to notice these changes.</p> <p>\"It is easier to detect in plants,\" says Tim Sparks, from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Monkswood, Cambridge, \"there's been a three week to one month advance in spring plants over the last 50 years.\" His research, as well as data gathered by other scientists, shows that there is a definite trend towards earlier flowering in plants and reproduction in animals. Now a new mathematical model can help explain how and why climate is having a major impact on our ecology.</p> <p>In Origin of Species, Darwin wrote, \"Climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a species, and periodical seasons of extreme cold and drought, I believe to be the most effective of all checks.\" However, few models of climate change have actively sought to understand how weather can affect sex and death in plants and animals. The model, created by assistant professor of biology, Eric Post, from Penn State University, is the first of its kind, incorporating biology to help quantify ecological responses to climate change.</p> <p>\"We hear with increasing frequency reports about birds nesting earlier and flowers blooming sooner,\" says Dr Post. \"Those reports get a lot of attention because they provide convincing evidence that species are responding to climate change. But if we really want to understand what is happening, and make predictions about what will happen with future climate changes, we need to get at the mechanisms and relationships behind the changes.\" Dr Post used data collected by a botanist for 50 years in Norway on three species of flowering plant: two kinds of anemone and colt's foot. Dr Post included the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to account for climatic variability. The NAO is an alteration in atmospheric pressures over Iceland and the Azores. It's responsible for a third of the variation in rainfall in the Northern Hemisphere, and over half the variation in temperature.</p> <p>What Dr Post and his colleagues discovered was that flowering was directly related to the NAO. After a warm winter, the flowers he studied bloomed earlier. The climate did not impact directly on the plants themselves, but on \"resources\". Resources in the case of plants would be nutrients in the soil, but Dr Post deliberately chose this rather nebulous term so that the model could apply to other species too.</p> <p>The effect was strongest on early blooming plants and those found in southern latitudes. The density of other flowering plants also had an affect. As Dr Post says, the timing of reproduction influences the numbers, growth and viability of offspring. One possible interpretation of the results is that the density of other plants triggers earlier blooming in order to minimise competition for food or pollinators.</p> <p>His theoretical predictions accord with data gathered by Tim Sparks and his colleagues. They have looked at 24 species of flowering plants, such as hazel and wood anemones, between 1891 and 1948. All of them show earlier flowering in response to a milder temperature. A quarter of a decade of data on laying dates for British birds, from great tits to sky larks, shows that eggs are being laid earlier. The warmer winters are prompting aphids and moths to emerge sooner, frogs to spawn and bees to be more active earlier in the year.</p> <p>Dr Post has looked at how the NAO can specifically influence animals. He found that red deer and reindeer breed earlier when the winters are warmer, but that the deer produce smaller calves which grow into smaller, less fertile adults. Climatic fluctuations can even influence what kind of creatures live where and with whom. In a wood near Dlouh\u00e1 Loucka in the Czech republic lives a group of pied and collared flycatchers which have been studied for the past 13 years. The two species compete with one another to the detriment of the pied flycatcher. The collared birds frequently evict the pied species from nest sites, and the latter are forced into poorer territories. Their breeding is delayed and in some cases they are unable to breed at all. Dr Post was able to show that the fate of the pied flycatchers is influenced by the NAO; in warmer winters the collared flycatchers produce more offspring and are able to suppress the breeding rates of the pied flycatchers.</p> <p>Could these warmer winters be a direct result of global warming? Sparks says: \"It is hard to believe that man hasn't had an effect on the climate - though not all Americans think so.\" The real problem for species is variation, according to Dr Post. In general there is a trend for increasingly warmer temperatures, but temperature deviates on a year-by-year basis. Sounding as if he's talking about an Escher painting, he says: \"The change in climate is like a staircase going up, but in profile, you can see it goes up and down.\"</p> <p>Animals have to respond to these changes, those that are unable to die out. Warmer winters could be beneficial, says Sparks. Quite apart from our own desire for a little more heat, butterfly populations could survive longer and increase their range; currently we only have about 60 species, whereas France enjoys 200. However, there is a downside. Not all species can adjust and may be indirectly and adversely affected, such as the pied flycatchers. \"We could have pests we'd rather not have,\" says Sparks, \"insects that carry plant diseases, moths which feed on bark.\" Flowers that bloom early may succumb to a late frost or snow, and those that leaf too soon could be devastated by drought later in the year. Darwin, as usual, was correct; but not even he could have foreseen how human activity could be the most effective of all checks.

One of the founders of modern ethno-botany and ethno-pharmacology, he researched the many uses of plants by native cultures, such as the Amazonian Indians, and documented the medicinal application of more than 2,000 of them.</p> <p>Schultes considered it part of his research to try out preparations, such as coca powder, with the tribesmen with whom he lived. He became the leading authority on hallucinogenic plants such as peyote and ayahuasca, which are used by Indian tribal cultures for ritual purposes.</p> <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, he influenced the likes of Aldous Huxley, William Burroughs and Timothy Leary, and the drug culture to which they helped to give birth. But, more importantly, he gathered some 24,000 Amazonian plant specimens, of which 120 now carry his name, though Schultes always acknowledged the prior botanical knowledge of his Amazonian tutors.</p> <p>In the introduction to his Where The Gods Reside (1988), he wrote: \"A number of years ago, I heard a high ranking South American diplomat describe the Amazon as a 'desert of trees that had to be cleared for the benefit of mankind'. Yet, investigations by Colombian and foreign botanists have recognised an unbelievably rich flora, and the detailed knowledge of it possessed by its native inhabitants. Advancing acculturation and civilisation everywhere spell the doom of extinction of this knowledge faster even than the extinction of species themselves as a result of forest devastation.\"</p> <p>Realising this grave threat, Schultes became a pioneering campaigner on protecting the forests from inappropriate, short-term development. He was one of the first researchers to point out that the conversion of forests to cattle ranches was a folly, because the soils would become infertile in a matter of years. He never tired of telling visitors about his deep concern about Amazonia and its tribal cultures.</p> <p>As a child, Schultes, the son of a Boston plumbing engineer, collected, and dried, plant specimens. Bedridden in early childhood, he became fascinated by Amazonia through reading the 19th-century British naturalist Richard Spruce's Notes Of A Botanist On The Amazon And The Andes. He was educated at East Boston High School and then won a scholarship to Harvard. As an undergraduate, he researched and wrote on the hallucinogen peyote, ritualistically used by Oklahoma's Kiowa Indians. Having received his doctorate - on plants used by the Indians of Oaxaca state in southern Mexico - in 1941, Schultes decided to study the medicinal, narcotic and poisonous plants used by natives of the north-western Amazon, mainly in Colombia.</p> <p>He spent 14 years almost uninterrupted in this area, journeying its rivers in an aluminium canoe. Schultes initially went to the region to investigate the source of curare, a composite hunting poison made by many differ ent tribes from various plant ingredients. Curare's special characteristic is that it kills the animal hit by a hunter's dart or arrow by paralysing its muscles, but does not kill the person eating its meat.</p> <p>These properties were found to make it valuable as a muscle relaxant in hospital surgery. He helped to identify more than 70 plant species that were used to produce different versions of the drug. Since the 1930s, curare has been widely used in medicine. At first it was supplied to American and European hospitals by tribal people themselves, but when it was synthesised in laboratories, the trading relationship with the forest people ended.</p> <p>During the war years, Schultes's work was directed towards the investigation of rubber trees of the genus Hevea, native to the north-western Amazon forests. The main purpose then was to encourage indigenous groups to harvest latex from wild stands of these trees for the war effort after the Japanese occupation of Malaya. After the war, he changed the focus of this work to the collection of living plant material for cultivation in the plantations of tropical countries of Asia and Africa.</p> <p>After going back to Harvard in 1954 to teach botany, he continued to return every year with some of his students. Schultes spent most of his time in the Amazon in the villages of tribal people. His approach acknowledged that people who have lived in a complex natural environ ment for a long time will have acquired a profound knowledge of the botanical riches that it contains and will also have developed complex language systems to match that knowledge.</p> <p>Schultes believed that tribal people should be approached with the respect due to all people. He treated the often fearsome-looking individuals he met with disarming cour tesy and never carried a firearm. \"I do not believe in hostile Indians,\" he said. \"All that is required to bring out their gentlemanliness is reciprocal gentlemanliness.\"</p> <p>After his retirement from Harvard in 1985 - where he was director of the botanical museum - Schultes, professor emeritus, was honoured with botany's \"Nobel prize\", the Gold Medal of London's Linnean Society, in 1992.

      "body": "<p>The foot and mouth crisis has been characterised throughout by a kind of mass lunacy that has beggared belief, but today it reaches its apotheosis. Having consigned millions of animals to a completely unnecessary death, the nation falls head over heels in love with a cuddly Charolais calf called Phoenix.</p> <p>Its fluffy white curls and cute eyes are staring out from most of the newspapers today; it was considered an important enough issue to get a top slot in the BBC news; unbelievably, the decision over whether it was to live or die went all the way up to Downing Street. Has there ever been a prime ministerial statement devoted to the life of a calf before?</p> <p>There was barely a murmur of protest when Phoenix's mother, dozens of cousins and thousands of contemporaries were killed, but suddenly a torrent of frustrated sentimentality is poured into the plight of this calf.</p> <p>So, on the very same day as we hear of the extraordinary brouhaha over Phoenix's survival for five days after a cull, we hear of hundreds of pet dogs being abandoned and off loaded by owners fed up with walking them under the foot and mouth restrictions. Never have the English seemed quite so batty in their attitudes to animals: slavishly mercenary and yet still capable of intermittent deep sentimentality.</p> <p>In fact, the two attitudes are different sides of the same coin: brutality is often masked by a warped tenderness. Now that the virus seems to be finally ebbing, the public is ready to relax their passive quiescence in the horror of this mass cull, and are anxious to reassure themselves that they are not quite so horrible after all.</p> <p>See, we may be in the process of massacring close to 4m animals but we still care for our lovely cuddly four-legged friends. The only sense to emerge from this pantomime (in which even Downing Street was prepared to play along) is that the rules on culling on contiguous farms is to be relaxed.</p> <p>Finally, this grim chapter in recent British history is drawing to a close; in a few more weeks, there will be no more nightly footage of mountains of rotting corpses.</p> <p>What will not fade is how this episode has exposed the brutality of our attitudes towards other living creatures and a sense of breathtaking hypocrisy.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a

      "bodyText": "The foot and mouth crisis has been characterised throughout by a kind of mass lunacy that has beggared belief, but today it reaches its apotheosis. Having consigned millions of animals to a completely unnecessary death, the nation falls head over heels in love with a cuddly Charolais calf called Phoenix. Its fluffy white curls and cute eyes are staring out from most of the newspapers today; it was considered an important enough issue to get a top slot in the BBC news; unbelievably, the decision over whether it was to live or die went all the way up to Downing Street. Has there ever been a prime ministerial statement devoted to the life of a calf before? There was barely a murmur of protest when Phoenix's mother, dozens of cousins and thousands of contemporaries were killed, but suddenly a torrent of frustrated sentimentality is poured into the plight of this calf. So, on the very same day as we hear of the extraordinary brouhaha over Phoenix's survival for five days after a cull, we hear of hundreds of pet dogs being abandoned and off loaded by owners fed up with walking them under the foot and mouth restrictions. Never have the English seemed quite so batty in their attitudes to animals: slavishly mercenary and yet still capable of intermittent deep sentimentality. In fact, the two attitudes are different sides of the same coin: brutality is often masked by a warped tenderness. Now that the virus seems to be finally ebbing, the public is ready to relax their passive quiescence in the horror of this mass cull, and are anxious to reassure themselves that they are not quite so horrible after all. See, we may be in the process of massacring close to 4m animals but we still care for our lovely cuddly four-legged friends. The only sense to emerge from this pantomime (in which even Downing Street was prepared to play along) is that the rules on culling on contiguous farms is to be relaxed. Finally, this grim chapter in recent British history is drawing to a close; in a few more weeks, there will be no more nightly footage of mountains of rotting corpses. What will not fade is how this episode has exposed the brutality of our attitudes towards other living creatures and a sense of breathtaking hypocrisy.

      "bodyText": "The white former boyfriend of black athlete Ashia Hansen set up a brutal \"racist\" attack on himself in the hope of rekindling their dying relationship and making money to pay off his debts, a court in Birmingham heard yesterday Christopher Cotter was slashed across the forehead and knifed three times in the back in the attack near Hansen's house in Birmingham on March 21 last year. He claimed that he had been attacked by neo-Nazi thugs objecting to his relationship with the Olympic triple jumper. But Tim Raggatt QC, acting for the prosecution, told the jury at Birmingham crown court that the 29-year-old financial adviser had arranged for two friends to assault him so that they could sell his story to a newspaper for thousands. He alleged that the trio then sent abusive mail to Hansen and other leading black athletes - including the Olympic gold medallist Denise Lewis, the sprinter Dwain Chambers and hurdler Tony Jarrett - to make the attack seem more convincing. \"They sent a batch of deeply offensive letters to Miss Hansen and - perhaps to give it more credence in the eyes of the world at large - to other household names,\" he said. Mr Cotter, Surgit Clair and Craig Wynn are jointly accused of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and conspiracy to obtain property by deception because of their plans to sell the story. They deny the charges. \"It is a case that is essentially about deceit - about elaborate and carefully thought-out lies,\" Mr Raggatt said. \"It was a confidence trick by these three defendants that was partly about greed, possibly attention seeking behaviour and certainly for Mr Cotter, an attempt to hoodwink Ashia Hansen and persuade her that a relationship she thought was over wasn't and should be resumed. \"In fact, it all failed. He didn't get the girl, he didn't get the money and it all ended in tears.\" He added: \"Mr Clair and Mr Wynn were clearly not part of getting the girl, but they were very much part of getting the profit.\" Mr Raggatt told the court that Mr Cotter, who earned around \u00a320,000 a year in his job at the Prudential, owed creditors including Hansen up to \u00a325,000 and had a substantial mortgage. \"I have no doubt someone will say to you that it is a pretty extraordinary thing that someone will allow himself to be injured with a knife,\" he said. \"If this was a plot, it was a very sophisticated one, designed to deceive people who are by nature sceptics: senior police officers and hard-bitten journalists. It needed to be convincing.\" Over-exuberance He added that the back injuries had been superficial, that the attackers might have caused more damage than they intended to through \"over-exuberance\" and that, according to Hansen, her former boyfriend had an unusually high tolerance of pain. Mr Cotter, who had arranged to have dinner with Hansen on the night of the attack, arrived on her doorstep bleeding heavily and claiming he had been assaulted in a cul-de-sac close to her home, where he had parked. He usually parked directly in front of her house, where there was space that evening. Extensive house to house inquiries by police failed to trace any witnesses to the incident, although the attack Mr Cotter described to police would have been \"protracted, noisy and violent\". The prosecution also detailed the flurry of phone calls between the defendants on the day of the attack. Mr Cotter had called Mr Clair four times within half an hour that evening and received a call from Mr Wynn minutes before the assault. Witnesses spotted a blue N-registered Ford Mondeo estate - the same kind of car as Mr Wynn drove - close to the scene. The court heard that Mr Clair, a sales manager for the Asian Business Directory, and Mr Wynn, a heating engineer, were not only close friends of Mr Cotter but had also acted as sources for the Daily Express in the past. Mr Clair allegedly tipped off a journalist at the Express about the supposed racist attack just an hour after it happened, when even Hansen was unaware of the apparent motive. The paper agreed to buy the story and went as far as drawing a cheque for \u00a36,000 made payable to Mr Cotter, although they never handed it over. Mr Cotter, a former long jumper, met Hansen in 1994. He moved to Birmingham with her two years later so that she could train with the Birchfield Harriers club. The couple split up and bought separate homes in 1997 and, although they continued to see each other, the relationship had entered \"a particularly torrid period\" by last March, the prosecution claimed. Mr Cotter's diaries, which are to be used as evidence, were said to demonstrate his \"strong emotion\" about the situation. Mr Raggatt described Hansen, who is due to give evidence today, as \"a lady of complete integrity\". The triple jumper failed to pick up any medals at the Sydney Olympics last year after suffering injury, despite being tipped for a gold. \"There was a pretty naked attempt to exploit her both personally and emotionally,\" Mr Raggatt said, adding that the public as a whole had also been affected by the plot. \"It was a use, or rather a misuse, of questions involving racially motivated violence, prejudice and that sort of highly emotive topic,\" he said. \"If you make light of matters of that kind and use them for selfish ends, you do considerable harm to the mixed community in which we all live.\" The case continues.",

But the prime minister, Tony Blair, faced angry protests today when he visited Cumbria, the county worst affected by foot and mouth. Farmers from the Cumbria Crisis Alliance gathered with placards to demand help from the government. Elizabeth Skelton, who owns an open farm in Morland just outside Penrith, said she had lost 14 sheep and 21 pigmy goats because she was classed as a contiguous case. \"Today they are telling people on contiguous farms they do not have to slaughter but it has come too late for me,\" she said. Earlier the chancellor, Gordon Brown, had welcomed the reprieve for Phoenix. \"I'm indeed very happy about that, and I'm happy that we are making progress so that Nick Brown can make this announcement this afternoon.\" He said that the government had been considering changing the policy in \"what has been the problem in relation to Phoenix, that is of contiguous farms - farms next door to farms where there is a diseased animal - you don't have to do the culling there in future.\" However, the Conservatives last night called on the government for an urgent explanation of the scientific basis for revising the policy.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>PAT: THAT IS THAT</strong> <br></p> <p>The Fiver never ever wants to go to Italy again. Or maybe we do. After all, that Zinedine Zidane has said some lovely things about us. But wait just one ruddy second: we really love England, and our boss. Even though we slag them off occasionally. Confusing signals alert! Confusing signals alert! Oh dear. The Fiver seems to have contracted Vieira-itis, as we just can't seem to make our minds up. </p> <p>\"Although some major clubs in Italy are interested in me, I won't return. Absolutely not!\" was what veering Viera said last October, only for him to then do a 180-degree U-turn earlier this year. \"I can't say I would never move to a side including Zidane and [David] Trezeguet. My return in Italy is possible\", he said. But today, Pat finally got off his large fence and reached a decision: he's staying at Arsenal until the end of his contract in 2004. \"I want to make it clear to every Arsenal fan that I have no intention of going to Italy or anywhere else,\" he announced. \"I became a better player after coming to England under Arsene Wenger so why should I even consider leaving Arsenal?\" </p> <p>But before the Fiver could interject with a sentence featuring the words \"lucre\", \"filthy\" and \"lots of it, baby\", Vieira was off again. \"It is very clear to the club that I want to stay at Arsenal\", he said. \"I have a contract until 2004 but who knows what will happen after that?\" In the meantime, Pat has predicted a rosy future for the club. \"We have a fantastic group of players here,\" he enthused. \"We were very unlucky in Europe but if we finish second and win the FA Cup, it will still have been a good season for us.\" Which of course, bears no relation to last week's remarks by a certain P Vieira that: \"Even if we manage to reach these two objectives, I would qualify our season as average.\" Is there a doctor in the house?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>TAYLOR STITCHED</strong> <br></p> <p>According to Ronan Keating, \"life is a rollercoaster\". The Fiver is not quite sure what he means by that, having never bothered to listen to the song. But we imagine the observation was only made after careful consideration of the nature of said fairground feature. And we also assume that Peter Taylor, the Foxiest of them all, may find the lyrics somewhat poignant.</p> <p>At the beginning of the season Pete, and the pair of tracksuit bottoms he borrowed from John Gregory, were all the rage. Indeed, the rage spilled over into outrage when talented Taylor wasn't picked for the England job ahead of Svennis the thicko. But if Leicester lose to Newcastle on Saturday, it will be a club-record 8th league defeat on the trot for the Foxes and, according to former Fox Steve Walsh, Taylor's got a bit of a crisis on his hands.</p> <p>\"In eight months, he [Peter Taylor] has systematically dismantled the side,\" says Walsh. The in-no-way-bitter Tamworth Town player, who had been tipped to take the top job at Filbert Street before Taylor won the day, claims that disillusionment is rife at the club (that's Leicester, not Tamworth) and that relegation could be on the cards next term. \"There's definite unrest in the dressing room,\" Walsh said. \"I think it's going to be an eventful summer with some players who can now see the problems.

      "bodyText": "PAT: THAT IS THAT The Fiver never ever wants to go to Italy again. Or maybe we do. After all, that Zinedine Zidane has said some lovely things about us. But wait just one ruddy second: we really love England, and our boss. Even though we slag them off occasionally. Confusing signals alert! Confusing signals alert! Oh dear. The Fiver seems to have contracted Vieira-itis, as we just can't seem to make our minds up. \"Although some major clubs in Italy are interested in me, I won't return. Absolutely not!\" was what veering Viera said last October, only for him to then do a 180-degree U-turn earlier this year. \"I can't say I would never move to a side including Zidane and [David] Trezeguet. My return in Italy is possible\", he said. But today, Pat finally got off his large fence and reached a decision: he's staying at Arsenal until the end of his contract in 2004. \"I want to make it clear to every Arsenal fan that I have no intention of going to Italy or anywhere else,\" he announced. \"I became a better player after coming to England under Arsene Wenger so why should I even consider leaving Arsenal?\" But before the Fiver could interject with a sentence featuring the words \"lucre\", \"filthy\" and \"lots of it, baby\", Vieira was off again. \"It is very clear to the club that I want to stay at Arsenal\", he said. \"I have a contract until 2004 but who knows what will happen after that?\" In the meantime, Pat has predicted a rosy future for the club. \"We have a fantastic group of players here,\" he enthused. \"We were very unlucky in Europe but if we finish second and win the FA Cup, it will still have been a good season for us.\" Which of course, bears no relation to last week's remarks by a certain P Vieira that: \"Even if we manage to reach these two objectives, I would qualify our season as average.\" Is there a doctor in the house? * * * * * * * * * * * * * TAYLOR STITCHED According to Ronan Keating, \"life is a rollercoaster\". The Fiver is not quite sure what he means by that, having never bothered to listen to the song. But we imagine the observation was only made after careful consideration of the nature of said fairground feature. And we also assume that Peter Taylor, the Foxiest of them all, may find the lyrics somewhat poignant. At the beginning of the season Pete, and the pair of tracksuit bottoms he borrowed from John Gregory, were all the rage. Indeed, the rage spilled over into outrage when talented Taylor wasn't picked for the England job ahead of Svennis the thicko. But if Leicester lose to Newcastle on Saturday, it will be a club-record 8th league defeat on the trot for the Foxes and, according to former Fox Steve Walsh, Taylor's got a bit of a crisis on his hands. \"In eight months, he [Peter Taylor] has systematically dismantled the side,\" says Walsh. The in-no-way-bitter Tamworth Town player, who had been tipped to take the top job at Filbert Street before Taylor won the day, claims that disillusionment is rife at the club (that's Leicester, not Tamworth) and that relegation could be on the cards next term. \"There's definite unrest in the dressing room,\" Walsh said. \"I think it's going to be an eventful summer with some players who can now see the problems. It's possible others could leave.\" The great news for Foxy fans is that the names tipped to leave the club include Trevor Benjamin, Ade Akinbiyi, Callum Davidson, and Lee Marshall. Only joking, it's actually the injured Muzzy Izzet and Matt Elliott (and any other good players). But Taylor is sticking to his guns, and claiming injuries are to blame. \"Any side would miss players of the calibre of Izzet and [knee victim Gerry] Taggart, but we will have to battle through without them as best as we can.\" Which, on recent evidence, is not good enough. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"If people want to call me the saviour of Manchester United, that's not a problem for me.\" And what if people want to call you a slick-haired big-nosed spookazoid, eh?

A statement from Emap Elan's chief executive, Barry McIlheney, said Emap had found it \"impossible to sustain the magazine as a long-term publishing proposition\". The publisher was unable to either confirm or deny reports it was in negotiations with travel agents interested in purchasing the magazine. The statement said: \"The Emap Elan Network is committed to finding permanent employment for the four members of staff on the magazine elsewhere across the network and would like to thank everyone on Escape Routes for their hard work and commitment over the last 18 months.\" Escape Routes was launched as the middle-market rival to Conde Nast's successful Conde Nast Traveller by the former OK! editor and News of the World reporter, Sharon Ring. Ms Ring, who doubled OK!'s circulation against Hello!, said at launch that she wanted the magazine to appeal to \"well-off housewives\". But insiders say the magazine failed to establish a niche in the market. It was never audited by the ABC, suggesting that copy sales were too low for an official audit figure, and insiders say it struggled to attract the high-end advertising of Conde Nast Traveller. Meanwhile, Ms Ring has become increasingly involved with the day-to-day running of Heat! magazine, Emap Elan's phenomenally successful celebrity title, whose circulation increased by almost 140% at the last ABCs.

It says the amendment will allow housing associations to exclude homeless families if, for example, they have a policy to bar people that have rent arrears or if they have a tough line on anti-social behaviour.</p> <p>Liz Nicholson, director of Shelter Scotland said: \"This change is a body blow to homeless people and seriously undermines the homelessness provisions in the Scottish executive's flagship housing bill.\"</p> <p>She added: \"To force through this amendment is nothing more than using the most vulnerable people as pawns in a political game.\" </p> <p>The SNP is suspected of trying to wreck the bill because it is against plans in the legislation to transfer council homes to housing associations.

      "bodyText": "Scottish opposition parties have been accused of using homelessness as a political football by providing a loophole for social landlords that will allow them to avoid housing homeless people. Shadow justice minister Fiona Hyslop of the Scottish National Party has successfully amended the housing bill to give more discretion to housing associations about who they house. Under the change, which was supported in committee by Conservative and Liberal Democrat members, councils will have to consider housing association's allocation policies when exercising their duty to house homeless people. Shelter Scotland has reacted with fury. It says the amendment will allow housing associations to exclude homeless families if, for example, they have a policy to bar people that have rent arrears or if they have a tough line on anti-social behaviour. Liz Nicholson, director of Shelter Scotland said: \"This change is a body blow to homeless people and seriously undermines the homelessness provisions in the Scottish executive's flagship housing bill.\" She added: \"To force through this amendment is nothing more than using the most vulnerable people as pawns in a political game.\" The SNP is suspected of trying to wreck the bill because it is against plans in the legislation to transfer council homes to housing associations. But Ms Hyslop said Shelter had over reacted and housing associations would not be allowed to exclude homeless people. She said the amendment would prevent \"local authorities dictating allocation policies to housing associations\". Ms Hyslop also said it would help housing associations keep homes free that had been earmarked for special groups such as older people or black and minority communities. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations said it was opposed to the move. Parliamentary officer David Bookbinder said: \"This is not something that we have asked for or support. It gives the impression that housing associations are trying to get out of their responsibilities.\" He claimed there were other provisions that would prevent the inappropriate allocations of housing. Jackie Baillie, minister for social justice, pledged to attempt to reverse the amendment. She said: \"We cannot leave this loophole open to the few landlords unwilling to accept their responsibilities towards those most in need of a home.\"",

And with that Ganga and Jamuna Shrestha, who were born sharing a skull, officially became two. </p> <p>The joke eased the tension in the packed operating theatre in Singapore general hospital - and what tension there had been. That final snip came after more than 84 hours of unprecedented, non-stop surgery, and 11 months to the day of barely imaginable hardship for two Nepalese babies from a remote mountain village who had never been able to roll over, sit up or even see each other. </p> <p>Any thoughts of breaking out the champagne never even occurred, however, says Dr Ho Lai Yun, the man in charge of their post-operative care: separating the babies was only the beginning. \"It's like climbing Mount Everest,\" he says. \"You have reached the peak and that's an achievement in itself but you still have to get home.\" </p> <p>It all began last August when Dr Keith Goh, a consultant neurosurgeon at the hospital, was told about Ganga and Jamuna by a former tutor, Dr Upendra Devakota, who was then practising in his home country of Nepal. \"He did not know what to do with the babies,\" Goh says, \"but knew that we had previously treated complex cases, so we got talking about it.\" </p> <p>After much arm-twisting and cajoling of hospital administrators and colleagues, Goh decided to bring over the twins, along with their mother Sandhya Shrestha, father KC Bushan, and her father Arjun Dev Shrestha for the operation. </p> <p>\"The large Nepali community here was a big factor,\" he says. \"The family were simple people and if you had placed them in a huge, western city in those circumstances, I think they would not have been able to survive.\" </p> <p>Sandhya had already endured an awful ordeal. Not only had the kindergarten teacher had a crude caesarean in a rural hospital, but it had been three months before she found out that her twins were conjoined. \"She was very ill to begin with,\" says a hospital source. \"And then when she recovered she was at home but the girls were still at the hospital and the family, including her husband, kept deceiving her about the true state of the girls.\" Eventually they ran out of excuses and took Sandhya to see her daughters. \"She burst into tears when she saw them.\" By that stage Jamuna was much larger than Ganga because the latter has a cleft palate and was having trouble feeding. </p> <p>When they arrived in Singapore, the family settled in with the Gurkha community while the honoury consul, MN Swami, started raising funds for the medical expenses. \"The initial goal was about 100,000 Singapore dollars (\u00a338,000),\" he says. \"But the response was so overwhelming we eventually stopped at S$650,000.\" Four thousand Singaporeans gave money. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Goh and his team were getting to know the girls. \"Jamuna is more introvert and behaves like a lady while Ganga is more like a man or a tomboy. She calls people to play with her while the other is more fussy with her food,\" says Dr Chumpon Chan, the leading vascular neurosurgeon on the team. </p> <p>\"They were obviously aware of each other,\" Dr Goh says. \"We sometimes saw them reaching out towards each other and feeling the other's head. When one was crying the other would be asleep and when the other made noise the one that was asleep would wake up and get angry. They would try and turn over and find that they couldn't, and get so frustrated.\" </p> <p>The doctors faced several major problems. The first was that the girls shared a common skull cavity with nothing between the two brains. Then the team discovered the girls shared veins - blood entered their brains via separate arteries but drained by a common vein. But the biggest challenge was finding a way to create enough skin to cover the two brains once they had been separated. </p> <p>\"We knew Jamuna could get complete skin cover,\" Goh says. \"Did that mean we should ensure 100% survival for her and let Ganga take her chances? Or should we treat them as equal and risk losing both?\" </p> <p>After countless discussions, the family made the decision - they wanted both to have an equal chance. Creating extra scalp cover was done by implanting balloon-type expanders into the girls' heads and injecting saline into the sacks. Meanwhile the medical team prepared with the help of nylon composite models and a cutting-edge 3D computer system called a Dextrascope, that superimposed images of the skull, the brains and the blood vessels on top of each other. </p> <p>Everything appeared to be going well until two days before the planned operation date in January, when Dr Lee Seng Teik, the leading plastic surgeon, discovered Ganga's skin expander had stretched the scalp too far and caused an infection. \"There was no way we could go ahead,\" Teik says. \"So we took everything out, allowed the infection to settle and then went in a second time and inserted a second expander.\" </p> <p>Finally they were ready. As Goh stood above the anaethsetised twins at about 4pm on Friday April 6, to make the first incision, he realised he was terrified. \"We were trying to dismantle something that God had put together. I'm not sure about the ethics of that, but there was soul-searching and mental anguish the weekend before.\" </p> <p>Separating them was far from easy. Not only were the two brains lying half on top of each other, but Teik needed the cutting to be done in a certain way to preserve as much skin cover as possible. Initially everything went very smoothly - the surgeons found a clear plane of separation between the brains. \"Each brain was protected by a membrane,\" Goh says. \"It was like a wall between two rooms.\" But the wall ended about a quarter of the way into the brain. The separation then became \"like walking along a garden path covered in leaves and branches and having to decide which to keep and which to move to which side,\" Goh says. \"Except that we were moving a millimetre at a time.\" They helped make decisions by sending electric pulses to different parts of the mass of brain in front of them to see which limb of which girl responded. </p> <p>Chan, who did most of the vascular work, says he had no idea of time passing. \"When you're doing the operation, you're just focusing on what's in front of you,\" he says. \"You hear noises but you don't know what's being said or how long you're taking.\" </p> <p>Seventy-two hours into the operation, after turning the twins over a couple of times - a process which took several hours each time - crisis struck. Blood was flowing from Jamuna to Ganga but not back again. Ganga appeared to be in the most critical condition so the doctors drew blood from Jamuna and physically pumped it into Ganga. They also tilted the operating table to let gravity help. After a couple of hours calm was restored and the girls' vital signs returned to normal. </p> <p>Once separation was completed, Jamuna was covered first because she had the smaller brain and the better natural coverage. Ganga was more problematic because there was eventually a patch of brain the size of a 50p coin that could not be covered. Teik resolved this by using a piece of Integra, an artificial fibrous tissue. </p> <p>The babies' recovery since then has been far from trouble-free. Ganga initially appeared to be in greater peril - she had a more serious infection and persistent fever. But then, last Saturday, during a regular examination, Dr Teik discovered that a 12cm-square section of the pericranium flap on Jamuna's head had not survived. \"The skin graft was lost and we were virtually back to square one,\" he says. \"We had to go in again or we would have lost her.\" \"Going in\" entailed a 19-hour operation on Sunday during which muscle was taken from her back along with more skin from her thigh for a fresh graft. It appears this second graft is healing as it should, he says, touching wood. </p> <p>\"They've come a long way but they're not out of danger yet,\" he says. \"The next six to eight weeks are going to be critical.\" With luck the girls will be heading home in about six months. </p> <p>By then the neurosurgeons should be able to have an idea of how much motor damage the girls have suffered. Goh says the signs so far are promising - neither girl is paralysed. \"We believe we're over the worst, but we have no idea where the end will be or when we will get there.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Gavyn Davies<br>50, Goldman Sachs chief economist, deputy chairman of the BBC</strong><br> Well placed for the job. A friend of Greg Dyke and Gordon Brown. Has a working knowledge of the BBC - until recently made regular appearances on the news as a commentator on the economy and he also chaired the independent review panel on BBC funding. He is a New Labour insider and a highly respected economist who distinguished himself with his controversial recommendation of a digital supplement to the licence fee in 1999. But he would be seen as a Tony crony. With Greg Dyke, a former Labour party member as director general, would be a dangerous appointment, leaving the BBC open to accusations that it was an arm of the Labour party. <strong>Chances: fair</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Lord Cranbourne<br> 56, leftwing Tory </strong><br> Former Tory leader of the Lords, sacked by William Hague after doing a deal with Tony Blair to keep some life peers and to the left of most Tories. Would appease critics who claim the BBC is a Labour poodle. <strong>Chances: very good</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Baroness Jay of Paddington <br> 61, leader of the House of Lords </strong><br> Currently Labour leader of the House of Lords, where she is nicknamed \"posh spice\", but is stepping down at the general election. Jay is Labour aristocracy - she's the daughter of former prime minister Jim Callaghan. If she got the BBC job she would become the boss of ex-husband Peter, the BBC's economics and business editor. Will be forever remembered for having an affair with Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein when Peter was Britain's US ambassador in the 1970s. <br><strong>Chances: good.</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Lord Alli <br>36, member of Labour kitchen cabinet </strong><br> Labour peer and wealthy TV executive. Founded Big Breakfast company Planet 24 with partner Charlie Parsons then sold out to Carlton TV where he briefly held an executive position. Openly gay, he is passionate about campaigning for equal rights for homosexuals and ethnic minorities. Has insider knowledge of both politics and media and has a mischievious streak - he once got into trouble for using the House of Lords address to advertise for staff for a new gay internet website. Chairmanship of the BBC would be a landmark, making him the first Asian to get to such heights, but would be seen as a Tony crony.<br> <strong>Chances: poor </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Michael Heseltine <br> 68, Tory wet</strong><br> Former member of Margaret Thatcher's cabinet whose career came to an abrupt halt over the Westland helicopters affair and later his unsuccessful leadership challenge. His career was resuscitated under John Major when he became chairman of the board of trade, but heart problems forced an abrupt end to his Westminster career. Inside knowledge of both politics and the media - through his 30-year tenure of publishing company Haymarket - makes him a good candidate, as do his Tory leanings. Could be an inspired compromise candidate.<br> <strong>Chances: very good</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Gerald Kaufman<br> 70, Labour backbencher</strong><br> The original culture vulture, the chairman of the Commons select committee on media knows the industry better than most. The MP for Gorton, Manchester since 1983 worked as a journalist on leftwing papers before becoming a Labour spin doctor. He provides better opposition on media issues than the Tories.<br> <strong>Chances: rank outsider </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Alastair Campbell<br> 43, PM's spin doctor</strong><br> Prime minister's press secretary Campbell has been on the left throughout his career, which began in journalism. The former Daily Mirror political editor became Tony Blair's press man in 1994 and has been trying to control the media ever since. He certainly will have spare time on his hands after the general election - he recently announced he would be stepping down to take a more hands-off role at No 10.<br> <strong>Chances: no hope </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Peter Mandelson<br> 47, former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland</strong><br> Another in-the-wilderness MP who has lots of spare time on his hands. The MP for Hartlepool and architect of New Labour has sharp media manipulation skills and would be ideal to take the BBC through the \"modernisation\" process that Greg Dyke has ordered. His pomposity matches that of Sir Christopher's, adding to his chances. And he knows a thing or two about the BBC. Newsnight recently admitted it was biased against him during the Hinduja affair and he famously pressured the BBC into banning references to his homosexuality. But his friendship with Blair, and his propensity to lose jobs makes him too accident prone. Too high risk. <br> <strong>Chances: will fall at first hurdle </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Lord John Wakeham<br> 68, Chairman of the Press Complaints Commission</strong><br> The smooth Press Complaints Commission chairman is as well known for pragmatism and diplomatic skills now as he was for being a powerful \"fixer\" while serving as a Tory MP under both Thatcher and Major. He survived a number of reshuffles and, as chief whip, is said to have run his whips like the chief of police. <br><strong>Chances: medium to good</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Lord Bragg<br> 62, polymath</strong><br> Melvyn Bragg's credentials are excellent - a lifetime in broadcasting, a lifetime promoting Labour and close bonds with Tony Blair. He has published several novels, including the controversial A Time to Dance, but he is best known as presenter of the South Bank Show.

      "bodyText": "Gavyn Davies 50, Goldman Sachs chief economist, deputy chairman of the BBC Well placed for the job. A friend of Greg Dyke and Gordon Brown. Has a working knowledge of the BBC - until recently made regular appearances on the news as a commentator on the economy and he also chaired the independent review panel on BBC funding. He is a New Labour insider and a highly respected economist who distinguished himself with his controversial recommendation of a digital supplement to the licence fee in 1999. But he would be seen as a Tony crony. With Greg Dyke, a former Labour party member as director general, would be a dangerous appointment, leaving the BBC open to accusations that it was an arm of the Labour party. Chances: fair Lord Cranbourne 56, leftwing Tory Former Tory leader of the Lords, sacked by William Hague after doing a deal with Tony Blair to keep some life peers and to the left of most Tories. Would appease critics who claim the BBC is a Labour poodle. Chances: very good Baroness Jay of Paddington 61, leader of the House of Lords Currently Labour leader of the House of Lords, where she is nicknamed \"posh spice\", but is stepping down at the general election. Jay is Labour aristocracy - she's the daughter of former prime minister Jim Callaghan. If she got the BBC job she would become the boss of ex-husband Peter, the BBC's economics and business editor. Will be forever remembered for having an affair with Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein when Peter was Britain's US ambassador in the 1970s. Chances: good. Lord Alli 36, member of Labour kitchen cabinet Labour peer and wealthy TV executive. Founded Big Breakfast company Planet 24 with partner Charlie Parsons then sold out to Carlton TV where he briefly held an executive position. Openly gay, he is passionate about campaigning for equal rights for homosexuals and ethnic minorities. Has insider knowledge of both politics and media and has a mischievious streak - he once got into trouble for using the House of Lords address to advertise for staff for a new gay internet website. Chairmanship of the BBC would be a landmark, making him the first Asian to get to such heights, but would be seen as a Tony crony. Chances: poor Michael Heseltine 68, Tory wet Former member of Margaret Thatcher's cabinet whose career came to an abrupt halt over the Westland helicopters affair and later his unsuccessful leadership challenge. His career was resuscitated under John Major when he became chairman of the board of trade, but heart problems forced an abrupt end to his Westminster career. Inside knowledge of both politics and the media - through his 30-year tenure of publishing company Haymarket - makes him a good candidate, as do his Tory leanings. Could be an inspired compromise candidate. Chances: very good Gerald Kaufman 70, Labour backbencher The original culture vulture, the chairman of the Commons select committee on media knows the industry better than most. The MP for Gorton, Manchester since 1983 worked as a journalist on leftwing papers before becoming a Labour spin doctor. He provides better opposition on media issues than the Tories. Chances: rank outsider Alastair Campbell 43, PM's spin doctor Prime minister's press secretary Campbell has been on the left throughout his career, which began in journalism. The former Daily Mirror political editor became Tony Blair's press man in 1994 and has been trying to control the media ever since. He certainly will have spare time on his hands after the general election - he recently announced he would be stepping down to take a more hands-off role at No 10. Chances: no hope Peter Mandelson 47, former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Another in-the-wilderness MP who has lots of spare time on his hands. The MP for Hartlepool and architect of New Labour has sharp media manipulation skills and would be ideal to take the BBC through the \"modernisation\" process that Greg Dyke has ordered. His pomposity matches that of Sir Christopher's, adding to his chances. And he knows a thing or two about the BBC. Newsnight recently admitted it was biased against him during the Hinduja affair and he famously pressured the BBC into banning references to his homosexuality. But his friendship with Blair, and his propensity to lose jobs makes him too accident prone. Too high risk. Chances: will fall at first hurdle Lord John Wakeham 68, Chairman of the Press Complaints Commission The smooth Press Complaints Commission chairman is as well known for pragmatism and diplomatic skills now as he was for being a powerful \"fixer\" while serving as a Tory MP under both Thatcher and Major. He survived a number of reshuffles and, as chief whip, is said to have run his whips like the chief of police. Chances: medium to good Lord Bragg 62, polymath Melvyn Bragg's credentials are excellent - a lifetime in broadcasting, a lifetime promoting Labour and close bonds with Tony Blair. He has published several novels, including the controversial A Time to Dance, but he is best known as presenter of the South Bank Show. He has made a career of championing upmarket, intelligent television, although he has been accused of dumbing down the arts with documentaries on subjects such as Joan Collins. A downside is he is seen as a Tony crony. Friends, however, say he is \"one to watch\". They claim the PM would be happy to put up with the jibes about the Blair Broadcasting Corporation. \"The Tories have always put their men in, so why won't he?\" Chances: good to very good Liz Forgan 56, TV writer and broadcaster The former head of BBC network radio and director of programmes at Channel 4, Ms Forgan certainly has the pedigree for the job. She has her own production company, Arrowhead Productions. She quit the BBC after clashing with Lord Birt's head prefect Tony Hall - then head of news and current affairs - over the future of radio journalism at the corporation. She could be the first woman to chair the BBC although she may not have the influence in Labour circles to cement the promotion.

The film is interspersed with other interviews, most notably with fellow \"cyberpunk\" author Bruce Sterling and both Bono and The Edge read from Gibson's books. </p> <p>Neale says the film couldn't have been made so cheaply five years ago. \"I was able to operate the whole set-up myself,\" he explains. \"We shot over 50 hours of interview with him [Gibson]; very, very cheaply. Both in terms of what it cost and the practicalities of shooting it with micro-cameras, the film is very much a digital production.\" </p> <p>Initially Neale acted as Gibson's driver in LA, picking him up after publishers meetings and interviewing him as the pair drove back to Gibson's home in Vancouver. Later, the pair drove further afield, visiting New York, Detroit and Austin, Texas. Neale doesn't appear in the documentary.

Neale met Gibson while working on the Channel 4 series, Buzz, in the early 90s. The pair first collaborated at the Seville Expo in 1992. </p> <p>\"He'll talk until the cows come home about literature,\" explains Neale. \"But the stuff he hasn't gone on the record about in the past, things like the loss of his parents, his dodging of the draft and taking drugs took a long time to get out of him. I had to go back and ask him those things several times. But drug culture was such a big part of his life. </p> <p>\"He decided to go on the record in a way that he has very deliberately avoided for a long time. Bits and pieces of his story have come out in interviews over the years, but the full story hasn't been told in its entirety. I suppose he has always been a bit of a recluse.\" </p> <p>Gibson is writing the script for Neuromancer with another British director Chris Cunningham. The film was due to start filming this summer, but both now feel they need to reinvent it as it has been picked bare by so many other science fiction films. </p> <p>Interestingly enough, for a writer who has had such a massive influence on the science fiction films of the last decade, only one of his short stories has been adapted for the cinema. \"A lot of people think that The Matrix or Neal Stephenson originated this stuff,\" says Neale. \"I think that the film is a timely reminder that he started a whole style of science fiction.\"The film has no distributor, but Neale is hoping for a limited theatrical release later this summer. But he sees the real target for No Maps as being the DVD market. Neale hopes to have it in the shops by the autumn.

Lawyers began preliminary arguments today about the three charges faced by the ex-MI5 agent under the Official Secrets Act. The 35-year-old former spy is accused of leaking details of the security services' activities to a Sunday newspaper four years ago. Arriving at the high court in London with girlfriend and ex-MI5 agent Annie Machon and members of his family, Mr Shayler said: \"We are going to put the British state on trial. I have nothing to fear - but they have everything to fear.\" Mr Shayler is expected to claim his prosecution under the Official Secrets Act is incompatible with the Human Rights Act, which protects free speech. Today prosecutor Nigel Sweeney QC told the hearing before Mr Justice Moses: \"By any sensible approach as to what the factual background ought to be, section 1 (of the OSA) is plainly compatible with Article 10 of the ECHR.\" Mr Shayler will only face charges relating to an article in the Mail on Sunday in 1997 and none concerning a whole range of allegations he has made since then about the activities of MI5 and MI6. There is a strong likelihood the case will get no further than the legal argument stage, Mr Shayler insisted this morning. \"It's obvious that this trial will be put back as a result of this preliminary hearing, possibly to appeal at the House of Lords,\" he said. \"If it takes place it will take place after the General Election. \"We plan to subpoena [home secretary] Jack Straw and [foreign secretary] Robin Cook and it is quite obvious they don't want to answer questions in open court right before an election.\" Mr Shayler claimed in the Mail on Sunday that agents in the 1970s tapped the telephone of the former Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, and kept a file on Jack Straw. The ex-agent claimed that he made these disclosures and his later revelations to expose incompetence and malpractice in the security services. Two of the charges relate to unauthorised disclosure of security service information and the third relates to revealing details of telephone taps. Each carries a maximum sentence of two years.

Visit <a href=\"http://www.littlejohnnyengland.co.uk\">www.littlejohnnyengland.co.uk</a> and all will become clear, as it did for me on one of my ambles around the more arcane reaches of the web. Exploring musical cyberspace earns me a few quid - I write about music - but most people do it for love. </p> <p>Nothing short of love could have driven the folk enthusiast Martin Nail to compile <a href=\"http://web.ukonline.co.uk/martin.nail/artists.htm\" target=\"_new\">his page</a> of hotlinks to working folk musicians with websites - more than 120 soloists and nearly 100 bands. These range from well-known names such as Ralph McTell, Fairport Convention and Pentangle (who can all be found through <a href=\"http://www.folkcorp.co.uk\">www.folkcorp.co.uk</a> to the most obscure newcomer. However, if by \"folk music\" you mean the really traditional sort as espoused by Vaughan Williams, go to the extensive and informative site run by the <a href=\"http://www.efdss.org\">English Folk Dance and Song Society</a>. </p> <p>From folk to family funk. My son Will plays bass guitar and spends hours flitting around manufacturers - <a href=\"http://www.fender.com\">www.fender.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.warwickbass.com\">www.warwickbass.com</a> and so on - or keeping an eye on secondhand vendors such as <a href=\"http://www.musical-exchanges.co.uk\">www.musical-exchanges.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guitars2ndhand.com\" target=\"_new\">www.guitars2ndhand.com</a>. Taxiing Will to his gigs has also introduced me to a number of young local bands, most of whom devote loving hours to their DIY websites such as <a href=\"http://www.autonomy1.com\">www.autonomy1.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.mycoolband.co.uk\">www.mycoolband.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>If you're not buying, try selling. Wondering if I could turn my surplus old vinyl into cash, I looked at several of the hundreds of internet barterers. My starting points were <a href=\"http://www.recordbuyer.co.uk\">Record Buyer magazine's site</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vip-24.com\">VIP Events</a>: both listed record fairs across the UK, had links to traders, and included small ads. </p> <p>Fancying a natter about rock and pop, I tried <a href=\"http://www.chat.msn.co.uk/find.asp?cat=\" mu\"\">Microsoft Network's music chat listings</a>. Weed Smokers Lounge sounded promising - at least I'd find silliness and laughter. Well, no, as it turned out: Eminem16: \"I luv Marshall\" </p> <p>Beggar: \"f off em he a gobshite he sux\" <br> HevvyKid: \"yah death to MM cos Bizkit rock\" <br> Eminem16: \"r u a prat or wot\" <br> SlipGirl: \"em16 u wanker\" </p> <p>After a few minutes of this, I gathered that nu-metal kids are a trifle hostile to whitetrash hip hop and left them to bicker into infinity. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\">Yahoo!</a> boasts a wider selection of chatrooms, its banners advertising interactive discussions on music. The day's \"featured room\" was called Groovespace but, predictably perhaps, housed a populace of sub-teen Nirvana dweebs. After 30 seconds of RudeTart, Slutino, Poogrrl (sic) and their pals, I felt extremely old. The rooms devoted to country and western, R&amp;B, jazz, and soul were so dull I began to lose the will to breathe. Surely Yahoo!'s classical music chat would prove more intellectually stimulating? Nope - except to anyone fascinated by a Nebraska 24-Hour Bach Telethon. Mind you, there was some lively debate about the weather around the USA. It's cold in Nebraska. And there was me thinking weather-whingeing was a British foible. </p> <p><a href=\"http://pages.yahoo.com/nhp?h=music\" target=\"_new\">Yahoo!'s Geocities</a> proved much more interesting. Be warned - you can get lost in here for hours! For example, follow the menus to \"song lyrics\" and you get no fewer than 875 collections ranging from nu-metal to old musicals. Or try the arts and entertainment category at <a href=\"http://www.ask.com\">AskJeeves</a>, again narrowing the selection through \"music\" to \"lyrics\" to \"rock and pop\".

      "bodyText": "Little Johnny England. Sounds like a football hooligan? Wrong, it's a collision of rock music and English traditional song. Intrigued? Visit www.littlejohnnyengland.co.uk and all will become clear, as it did for me on one of my ambles around the more arcane reaches of the web. Exploring musical cyberspace earns me a few quid - I write about music - but most people do it for love. Nothing short of love could have driven the folk enthusiast Martin Nail to compile his page of hotlinks to working folk musicians with websites - more than 120 soloists and nearly 100 bands. These range from well-known names such as Ralph McTell, Fairport Convention and Pentangle (who can all be found through www.folkcorp.co.uk to the most obscure newcomer. However, if by \"folk music\" you mean the really traditional sort as espoused by Vaughan Williams, go to the extensive and informative site run by the English Folk Dance and Song Society. From folk to family funk. My son Will plays bass guitar and spends hours flitting around manufacturers - www.fender.com, www.warwickbass.com and so on - or keeping an eye on secondhand vendors such as www.musical-exchanges.co.uk and www.guitars2ndhand.com. Taxiing Will to his gigs has also introduced me to a number of young local bands, most of whom devote loving hours to their DIY websites such as www.autonomy1.com or www.mycoolband.co.uk. If you're not buying, try selling. Wondering if I could turn my surplus old vinyl into cash, I looked at several of the hundreds of internet barterers. My starting points were Record Buyer magazine's site and VIP Events: both listed record fairs across the UK, had links to traders, and included small ads. Fancying a natter about rock and pop, I tried Microsoft Network's music chat listings. Weed Smokers Lounge sounded promising - at least I'd find silliness and laughter. Well, no, as it turned out: Eminem16: \"I luv Marshall\" Beggar: \"f off em he a gobshite he sux\" HevvyKid: \"yah death to MM cos Bizkit rock\" Eminem16: \"r u a prat or wot\" SlipGirl: \"em16 u wanker\" After a few minutes of this, I gathered that nu-metal kids are a trifle hostile to whitetrash hip hop and left them to bicker into infinity. Yahoo! boasts a wider selection of chatrooms, its banners advertising interactive discussions on music. The day's \"featured room\" was called Groovespace but, predictably perhaps, housed a populace of sub-teen Nirvana dweebs. After 30 seconds of RudeTart, Slutino, Poogrrl (sic) and their pals, I felt extremely old. The rooms devoted to country and western, R&amp;B, jazz, and soul were so dull I began to lose the will to breathe. Surely Yahoo!'s classical music chat would prove more intellectually stimulating? Nope - except to anyone fascinated by a Nebraska 24-Hour Bach Telethon. Mind you, there was some lively debate about the weather around the USA. It's cold in Nebraska. And there was me thinking weather-whingeing was a British foible. Yahoo!'s Geocities proved much more interesting. Be warned - you can get lost in here for hours! For example, follow the menus to \"song lyrics\" and you get no fewer than 875 collections ranging from nu-metal to old musicals. Or try the arts and entertainment category at AskJeeves, again narrowing the selection through \"music\" to \"lyrics\" to \"rock and pop\". The Big Index at www.myths.com caught my eye with its proclamation: \"Words to songs which I like\". This bizarrely eclectic one-man listing also offered links to \"real websites chock full of lyrics with search engines and all that stuff\" but I dallied. After comparing Layla with Lola (take away the music and the former is revealed as embarrassing schmaltz while the latter remains a witty take on transvestites) and brushing up on Talking Heads' Life During Wartime, up popped US meteorology again... \"Oklahoma!... where the wind comes sweeping down the plain.\" Cold there too, then. Of course, there's also plenty of mainstream stuff online. I check out the album and singles charts at www.totp.beeb.com/charts/album1 or at www.nme.com each week, and usually catch up on the day's pop news at www.music365.com. I also visit www.allmusic.com frequently. This resource for pop and rock fans offers an extraordinarily comprehensive guide to popular music.

It did not involve any German units, though the occupiers and the Waffen SS had made no secret of their own homicidal intentions towards Polish Jews. The joyous, demented sadists of Jedwabne were Poles to a man (and woman).</p> <p>Jan Gross, who stumbled on the documentary evidence by accident in a Polish archive five years ago, spares us no detail. Jewish men were forced to enact grotesque rituals before being butchered; women were raped and beheaded; babies were trampled to death; finally, more than 1,000 tortured Jews were herded into a barn, drenched with kerosene and torched. The Poles played raucous music in order to muffle their screams. They had surrounded the town to make sure that no Jew could escape (it would appear that there were, in fact, seven survivors).</p> <p>The massacre at Jedwabne had been preceded by similar atrocities in the surrounding region. At Radzilow some 1,500 were massacred; 1,200 in nearby Wsosz. In every instance, rituals of humiliation, of slow torture, of unspeakable bestiality accompanied the killings. Though encouraged and sometimes initiated by the Nazi occupiers, the mass murders were the work of \"local hooligans\".</p> <p>This anodyne phrase masks the involvement, the participation of the vast majority of the local Polish communities, who watched the carnival of Jewish agony with derisive indifference or active approval.

As nauseating, though in a different way, is his implacable exposition of the aftermath. After the liberation of Poland there followed an ice-age of systematic falsehood and amnesia.

These were not shown in Poland. Crimes against the Jews were the doing of the Nazi occupier. This served the interests both of the communist regime and of Polish nationalism. Of course, there had been heroic Polish men and women who had striven to help Jews. Of course, there were postwar voices seeking to speak the truth. But they were not many, and fellow Poles often turned on them in fury. To ask a taxi-driver to take one to the somewhat lamentable ghetto memorial in Warsaw was to risk insult or the assurance that the survival of a Jewish remnant was to be deplored.</p> <p>Gross tracks down the evidence. An investigation into the Jedwabne horror led to the acquittal of 10 defendants, to the release of another dozen well before the end of their sentences, and to the reprieve of the one accused actually sentenced to death.

This was no throwaway line. He returned to it time after time. The cries for help from medics and managers - noted in these columns earlier this week - have not just been taken seriously but addressed. The health secretary set out cogent reasons why Labour had had to be centralist in its first term. He acknowledged the fatigue and cynicism that two decades of chop and change generated. He sensibly expressed sympathy for the pressure under which staff were currently operating. But then he showed them the sunny uplands. Reform was as much in the interests of NHS staff as patients. Work would become more rewarding. Money and decision-taking would be devolved to the front line. It would not be Labour's 10-year plan but the 1m NHS employees'. They would be the people who decided how the reforms would be delivered locally. </p> <p>Of course there are caveats. What happens to public health?

What happens to social service departments under the new regional directors for health and social care? Officials say these posts are purely concerned with joining up the department's internal, not external, divisions. Most important of all, will Alan Milburn change his behaviour? Is it a true conversion? No health boss has been more Stalinist.

This welcome blast of originality is heightened by a plot that turns from \"rescue girlie\" into a full-blown political epic. </p> <p>Actually it is the sheer vastness of SoA that makes it so special; after 20 to 25 hours' play you will suddenly come across a whole new area. </p> <p>Unfortunately there is a problem with the game; random battles. While combat is an integral part of the RPG - victory gives you the points that improve your character - the sheer onslaught here really detracts. </p> <p>Whether it's on your ship or on an island, your exploration will be regularly halted by a turn-based battle. Yes, there is strategy, especially with team management, and welcome variety when fighting with the ship, but after the 900th encounter even the biggest devotee will flag. Amazingly, the sheer addiction and scope of the game soon entices you back in. </p> <p>Guiding an airborne galleon, battling other ships and landing on dungeon-filled islands is as enjoyable as it sounds and when you throw in some of the best graphics this side of Shenmue you have an undoubted success.

So, did Namco exploit that by targeting the home player? </p> <p>Sadly not - unless you count the omission of any kind of two-player mode, which removes almost half the fun. Still, the learning time is close to zero: plug in a G-Con gun, point the barrel at the screen, and begin. </p> <p>The gameplay has not changed much from earlier versions, nor have the colour-coded enemies, which you have to mow down by the score. (Watch out for the red ones. They shoot straight.) However, the pace is frenetic and there are some challenging bosses to add a bit of novelty. There is also a time trial mode, to give the game more longevity. </p> <p>Although presented as a 3-D action adventure, TCPT is basically a series of shooting galleries. The graphics are good, but not exceptional, given the game's static nature. </p> <p>However, there is a lot of action, with baddies somersaulting out of doorways or descending on ropes, before pausing for a split second while you aim to kill. </p> <p>On the whole, the result is somewhat disappointing. It's not that it's bad, it just doesn't take the series anywhere new. You might as well go for Point Blank 3, which is nothing more than a shooting gallery, but does have some humour. </p> <p>If you already play Time Crisis, this sequel provides another excuse to get the light gun plugged in.

What the hell were Team 17 thinking when they released Worms World Party? Here's a wild stab: \"Money, money, money.\" </p> <p>Well, if there's any vestige of justice in this world, they won't get a penny from this barely rehashed dead horse, which has been not just flogged but shot, chopped up into dice-sized cubes and burned. </p> <p>Sure, there may be a couple of new weapons (the longbow, possibly, and maybe the petrol bomb). There may also be some new sound sets, the odd terrain, and a couple of new training missions: with all the incarnations this game has gone through, it's kind of difficult to keep track. On a more positive note, the multiplayer missions mode, whereby two teams compete to attain different goals, is definitely new; indeed, a lot more attention has been paid to the multiplayer experience generally, with competitive and cooperative missions, an online ranking system, and a sophisticated in-game chat facility. </p> <p>But in terms of value for your money, money, money, that's as far as it goes. </p> <p>The training levels are the same as those in Worms: Armageddon; the missions are new, but on such familiar ground as to make no difference.

      "trailText": "<p><strong>The code of mistrust</strong></p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>The code of mistrust</strong></p> <p> If family life is seen as essentially rotten to the core, which other institution could possibly be perceived as good? If parents, brothers and sisters cannot be entirely trusted, how can we have faith in the integrity of more distant acquaintances? This is the message conveyed on a daily basis through television and popular culture. Not a day goes by without another sordid tale of some professional abusing the trust that has been placed in him or her. The suspicion of abuse that hangs over the family has spread like a disease to infect other institutions from schools to Scout and Guide groups. Where once there would have been an assumption of goodwill, dangers are now seen to lurk.</p> <p> An editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine claims that sport is 'the last refuge of child abuse'. 'I know it is going on from hundreds of interviews with athletes but it is difficult to get any statistical evidence', writes Celia Brackenridge. Many sporting bodies have issued guidelines about how to spot potential abusers working in their midst. In December 1998 the Amateur Swimming Association, in conjunction with the NSPCC, set up a helpline for children on the grounds that their sport might be targeted by paedophiles like the Olympic swimming coach jailed for child sex abuse. In 1999, the England and Wales Cricket Board issued child protection guidelines. At least one commentator blamed the collapse of English cricket on paedophiles who made parents reluctant to allow unsupervised children to play the game.</p> <p> Predatory paedophiles have also become an issue with the St John Ambulance service, after three of its officers were jailed for the long-term abuse of cadets in 1998. The British Scout Association has been implicated in sex scandals. After a Coventry Scoutmaster was jailed for indecency offences against two boys and a Hampshire Scoutmaster was sentenced to six years for sexually abusing eight boys, the Association adopted a policy to 'safeguard the welfare of all members by protecting them from physical, sexual and emotional harm.</p> <p> Even religious organizations have been implicated in this, climate of fear. In Australia, Roman Catholic bishops have sought to ban their priests from having any private contact with children. Guidelines drawn up with the approval of the Vatican mean that confessionals have to be fitted with glass viewing panels. Priests are also banned from seeing any child alone with the door closed. Closed doors and private interaction are no longer acceptable to a society fed on a constant diet of mistrust. It is as if by definition the closed door is an invitation to abuse.</p> <p> Any one-to-one contact between adults and children has effectively been stigmatized. A guideline published by the Salvation Army advises its members to ensure that 'an adult is not left alone with a child or a young person where there is little or no opportunity for the activity to be observed by others'. It adds that this 'may mean groups working within the same large room or working in an adjoining room with the door left open'. Salvation Army members were far from happy with this rule since many of their activities involve musical practice. Since band members play different instruments at various levels of proficiency, a lot of the training took place one-to-one in separate rooms. Nevertheless, the new order dictates that doors should be left open - and, presumably, ears closed.</p> <p> A guideline issued by the British Home Office to voluntary organizations recommends that activities 'which involve a single child working with an adult' should 'take place in a room which can be observed easily by others in nearby areas, even if this is achieved simply by leaving doors open'. Scout Association guidelines warn scout leaders to avoid one-to-one situations and contact sports. Guidelines issued by the England and Wales Cricket Board tell coaches not to work with a child 'completely unobserved', and suggest that 'parents should take on the responsibility for their children in the changing rooms '.</p> <p> The return of the medieval chaperone in Britain provides eloquent testimony to the regulation of adult contact with children. In one case a rector at a village church was forced to disband a choir because of new guidelines on child protection. Up to 20 child choristers met weekly for rehearsals and sang every Sunday at St Michael's Church in Northchapel, West Sussex. The Rev. Gerald Kirkham had to stop recruiting because, under the new code, at least two adult chaperones were needed at choir practice.</p> <p> Mistrust of adults, especially of men, has had a destructive impact on working relations between adults and children. Many adults have become wary of volunteering for this sort of work. The British Scout Association faces a shortage of volunteer leaders. 'If a man says he wants to work with young boys, people jump to one conclusion', reported Jo Tupper, a spokeswoman for the Scout Association. A similar pattern is evident in primary education. Research carried out by Mary Thornton of Hertfordshire University suggests that men are turning away from primary school teaching because of fears that they will be labelled 'perverts'. Thornton claimed that men on teacher training programmes 'felt they had no idea how to deal with physical contact'. Some of the trainees asked, for example, whether they 'should cuddle a distressed child'. When physical contact with children comes with a health warning, teachers face a continual dilemma over how to handle routine issues in the classroom. In August 1998, the Local Government Association even went so far as to advise teachers not to put sun cream on pupils because it could lead to accusations of child abuse. Lord Puttnam, the inaugural chairman of the General Teaching Council has warned that when teachers are regarded as potential rapists and paedophiles their authority is seriously undermined.</p> <p> In November 1999, it was reported that 'Teachers, fearful of accusations of any kind of inappropriate touching, are increasingly wary of direct contact with the children in their charge, even if tears are involved.' One school in Glasgow has responded to this 'affectionphobic culture' by introducing special massage classes for children. The idea is that pupils will stay fully clothed and standing upright while they take turns to massage each other's heads, backs and shoulders. While the teacher reads a story, they will also take turns to massage each other's forearms with plain, unscented oil.' A new ritual for an age that dreads physical contact between adult and child.</p> <p> Fear of adults victimizing children is fuelled by a child protection industry obsessed with the issue of abuse. The NSPCC's Safe Open Spaces for Children, launched in August 1999, advised parents never to make their children 'kiss or hug an adult if they don't want to'.

But it is not only professional carers or volunteers who are affected by this climate of paranoia. Suspicion towards them reflects and reinforces a more general distrust of adults. It is assumed that none of us can be expected to respect the line between childhood and adulthood: that we need to be told what almost all of us know by instinct - children are vulnerable creatures who need protection.

If an adult touching a child comes to be regarded with anxiety, how can these relations be sustained?</p> <p> Is it any surprise that many adults are literally scared of badly behaved children. Take the following scene on the lawn of one of Britain's leading universities. Over 200 law lecturers and students are waiting for an official photograph to be taken. A young girl cycles up to the group and plonks herself down in front of the group and refuses to move. She is asked politely to move, but still refuses to do so. Not a single adult in this large group dares to intervene, reprimand the young girl or physically move her on. Afterwards, the lecturers justify their paralysis on the grounds that they feared accusations of assault or abuse if they had attempted to move her out of the way. In this stand-off the young girl emerges as the winner. Twenty minutes later, bored with her easy victory over the disoriented adults, the girl leaves of her own accord.</p> <p> It should really come as no surprise that some children have begun to play off this general distrust of adults to make life difficult for those they don't like. Most children are enterprising creatures, for whom adult insecurities provide an opportunity to exercise their power. Every year hundreds of teachers face false allegations of abuse. A teacher wept openly at the April 2000 conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers as he recounted his three months of agony after being falsely accused of punching a 12-year-old pupil. Other teachers recounted cases of false accusation and demanded that school staff should not be treated as guilty until proven innocent. It is tempting to blame malicious children for making life hell for some of their teachers. But it is not really their fault. They are merely manipulating a dirty-minded world created by obsessive adults.</p> <p> The distrust of adult motives has encouraged a flight from children: a distancing between the generations. In some cases it has led to an avoidance of physical contact, in others the reluctance to take responsibility. The flight from children expresses adult confusions about how to relate to younger generations. Elderly people in particular are often unclear about what is expected of them in dealing with children. An 82-year-old man with numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren provides a classic illustration of this dilemma:</p> <p> I was in a shop and this woman came in who the wife knew, with her little granddaughter. I was eating a sweet, and this little girl looked up at me, so I said, 'would you like a sweetie, duck?' She got all scared and jumped back. And I said, 'well that's the best thing you want to do. Never take a sweetie off nobody'. She done right, but it made me feel cheap, like. It made me feel awful really, to think I was offering a little girl a sweet. And I love kiddies. In the paper you hear there's horrible people about and it's awful, but it made me feel right cheap.</p> <p> This octogenarian has internalized the new mood of suspicion towards adult motives. His mental retreat from following his well-meaning instincts towards the young girl is part of a general pattern. Sadly, this flight from children means that adult collaboration in raising the young rests on a fragile foundation. Parents of course cannot flee from their children. They are left to deal with the damage caused by the erosion of adult solidarity. They are truly on their own. The decline of adult solidarity means that parents must pay the cost for society's estrangement from its children.</p> <p><strong>Parents on their own</strong></p> <p> More than ever parents are on their own. According to Professor John Adams of University College, London, we live in an age of hypermobility, where the car has facilitated a new level of social dispersal. Adams believes that hypermobiliry has led to the increased anonymity of individual households, a decline of conviviality towards our neighbours, a less child-friendly environment and the emergence of parental anxieties towards children's outdoor safety. His concerns are echoed by numerous studies that confirm a palpable sense of social isolation. A survey published by the Royal Mail in 1999 revealed that people now live further away from relatives - though the majority still live within an hour's journey. A quarter of respondents aged under 35 rarely or never spoke to their neighbours. Nearly a third of these respondents said that they would only offer to help neighbours if it was absolutely necessary, and did not want to know them any better. This indifference towards the fate of neighbours underlines the absence of communal affinity. We often live in neighbourhoods without neighbours. The absence of an obvious network of support has important implications for the way that adults negotiate the task of child-rearing.</p> <p> The theme of social isolation is a familiar one to most parents. Mothers and fathers complain about an uneasy sense that they are 'on their own'. Many mothers, especially those who work, are preoccupied with what could go wrong with their childcare arrangements. When there are no relatives near, and you are not on first-name terms with your neighbours, who is to pick up your child when your meeting runs late? Who can stay home and nurse a child off school for two weeks with chickenpox? The absence of an obvious back-up, the tenuous quality of friendship networks and the difficulty of gaining access to quality childcare all helps to create the feeling that life is one long struggle, increasing tensions within the household.</p> <p> The fragmentation of family relations and the diminished sense of community have inevitably helped to make parents feel insecure. Not knowing where to turn in case of trouble can produce an intense sense of vulnerability - especially among lone parents who feel that they are literally on their own. The isolation of parents is not simply physical. The erosion of adult solidarity transforms parenting into an intensely lonely affair. A climate of suspicion serves to distance mothers and fathers from the world of adults. In turn, this predicament invites parents to be anxious and over-react - not just to the danger they see posed by strangers, but to every problem to do with their youngsters' development. As we shall see, paranoid parenting now embraces almost every aspect of child-rearing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The code of mistrust If family life is seen as essentially rotten to the core, which other institution could possibly be perceived as good? If parents, brothers and sisters cannot be entirely trusted, how can we have faith in the integrity of more distant acquaintances? This is the message conveyed on a daily basis through television and popular culture. Not a day goes by without another sordid tale of some professional abusing the trust that has been placed in him or her. The suspicion of abuse that hangs over the family has spread like a disease to infect other institutions from schools to Scout and Guide groups. Where once there would have been an assumption of goodwill, dangers are now seen to lurk. An editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine claims that sport is 'the last refuge of child abuse'. 'I know it is going on from hundreds of interviews with athletes but it is difficult to get any statistical evidence', writes Celia Brackenridge. Many sporting bodies have issued guidelines about how to spot potential abusers working in their midst. In December 1998 the Amateur Swimming Association, in conjunction with the NSPCC, set up a helpline for children on the grounds that their sport might be targeted by paedophiles like the Olympic swimming coach jailed for child sex abuse. In 1999, the England and Wales Cricket Board issued child protection guidelines. At least one commentator blamed the collapse of English cricket on paedophiles who made parents reluctant to allow unsupervised children to play the game. Predatory paedophiles have also become an issue with the St John Ambulance service, after three of its officers were jailed for the long-term abuse of cadets in 1998. The British Scout Association has been implicated in sex scandals. After a Coventry Scoutmaster was jailed for indecency offences against two boys and a Hampshire Scoutmaster was sentenced to six years for sexually abusing eight boys, the Association adopted a policy to 'safeguard the welfare of all members by protecting them from physical, sexual and emotional harm. Even religious organizations have been implicated in this, climate of fear. In Australia, Roman Catholic bishops have sought to ban their priests from having any private contact with children. Guidelines drawn up with the approval of the Vatican mean that confessionals have to be fitted with glass viewing panels. Priests are also banned from seeing any child alone with the door closed. Closed doors and private interaction are no longer acceptable to a society fed on a constant diet of mistrust. It is as if by definition the closed door is an invitation to abuse. Any one-to-one contact between adults and children has effectively been stigmatized. A guideline published by the Salvation Army advises its members to ensure that 'an adult is not left alone with a child or a young person where there is little or no opportunity for the activity to be observed by others'. It adds that this 'may mean groups working within the same large room or working in an adjoining room with the door left open'. Salvation Army members were far from happy with this rule since many of their activities involve musical practice. Since band members play different instruments at various levels of proficiency, a lot of the training took place one-to-one in separate rooms. Nevertheless, the new order dictates that doors should be left open - and, presumably, ears closed. A guideline issued by the British Home Office to voluntary organizations recommends that activities 'which involve a single child working with an adult' should 'take place in a room which can be observed easily by others in nearby areas, even if this is achieved simply by leaving doors open'. Scout Association guidelines warn scout leaders to avoid one-to-one situations and contact sports. Guidelines issued by the England and Wales Cricket Board tell coaches not to work with a child 'completely unobserved', and suggest that 'parents should take on the responsibility for their children in the changing rooms '. The return of the medieval chaperone in Britain provides eloquent testimony to the regulation of adult contact with children. In one case a rector at a village church was forced to disband a choir because of new guidelines on child protection. Up to 20 child choristers met weekly for rehearsals and sang every Sunday at St Michael's Church in Northchapel, West Sussex. The Rev. Gerald Kirkham had to stop recruiting because, under the new code, at least two adult chaperones were needed at choir practice. Mistrust of adults, especially of men, has had a destructive impact on working relations between adults and children. Many adults have become wary of volunteering for this sort of work. The British Scout Association faces a shortage of volunteer leaders. 'If a man says he wants to work with young boys, people jump to one conclusion', reported Jo Tupper, a spokeswoman for the Scout Association. A similar pattern is evident in primary education. Research carried out by Mary Thornton of Hertfordshire University suggests that men are turning away from primary school teaching because of fears that they will be labelled 'perverts'. Thornton claimed that men on teacher training programmes 'felt they had no idea how to deal with physical contact'. Some of the trainees asked, for example, whether they 'should cuddle a distressed child'. When physical contact with children comes with a health warning, teachers face a continual dilemma over how to handle routine issues in the classroom. In August 1998, the Local Government Association even went so far as to advise teachers not to put sun cream on pupils because it could lead to accusations of child abuse. Lord Puttnam, the inaugural chairman of the General Teaching Council has warned that when teachers are regarded as potential rapists and paedophiles their authority is seriously undermined. In November 1999, it was reported that 'Teachers, fearful of accusations of any kind of inappropriate touching, are increasingly wary of direct contact with the children in their charge, even if tears are involved.' One school in Glasgow has responded to this 'affectionphobic culture' by introducing special massage classes for children. The idea is that pupils will stay fully clothed and standing upright while they take turns to massage each other's heads, backs and shoulders. While the teacher reads a story, they will also take turns to massage each other's forearms with plain, unscented oil.' A new ritual for an age that dreads physical contact between adult and child. Fear of adults victimizing children is fuelled by a child protection industry obsessed with the issue of abuse. The NSPCC's Safe Open Spaces for Children, launched in August 1999, advised parents never to make their children 'kiss or hug an adult if they don't want to'. The justification for this proposal was that it would make children confident about refusing the advances of a stranger. From time immemorial, parents have pleaded with their children to kiss or hug grandmothers and aunts. The call to ban this innocent practice is symptomatic of the intense professional mistrust of adult behaviour towards children. All this hysteria about physical contact actually does little to protect children. By casting the net so wide and expecting child abuse to be a normal occurrence, there is a danger of trivializing this dreadful deed. A climate of suspicion will not deter the child abuser, but it will undermine the confidence of all parents. And at the end of the day, confident parents are best placed to educate their children to deal with risks and danger.

      "body": "<p><strong>The precautionary approach to parenting</strong></p> <p> Parental paranoia today is more than simply a worse version of past anxieties. For instance, a common target of child-rearing manuals before the Second World War was the over-protective parent, and guilt-ridden parents worried that they might be 'smothering' their children. But how many times do we hear parents criticized for being over-protective today? Indeed, many of the traits associated with the classic over-protective father or mother are likely to be praised by today's child experts as responsible parenting. Parents are continually urged to do even more to protect their children.</p> <p> Researchers advise parents to supervise children, not only outdoors, but even when they watch television. The term 'coviewing' has been coined to describe the practice of hands-on parents playing the role of a 'media value filter and a media educator'. Other researchers further, claim that parental supervision inoculates children from many of the dangers they face. They contend that 'parental monitoring has been inversely associated with antisocial behaviour, drug use, tobacco use and early sexual activity'. There is obviously some truth in this. The more time a child spends in the company of his or her parents the less time is available for smoking, drinking and sex. But to equate the amount of parental supervision directly with behavioural outcomes tells parents that the more time they manage to spend with their children, the better their offspring will be. This raises the question of where to draw the line. How do parents decide how much monitoring is reasonably required, as opposed to optimally possible?</p> <p> Unfortunately, parental supervision is today always interpreted as a positive virtue so parents can never spend too much time supervising their youngsters. Child-rearing experts occasionally concede that it is simply impossible to keep children and young teenagers under constant adult supervision. But even then they insist that alternative, indirect, forms of child surveillance are employed. One American expert argues that if a child has to be left under self-care, then parents must do whatever they can to supervise in absentia, by liaising with a trusted adult who knows what the youngster is up to. The message is clear: if you are going to shirk your responsibility towards your child even for a few hours, you must at least make sure that somebody else is doing your job for you.</p> <p> Parents are not just advised to supervise their children. In Britain, such advice contains the implicit threat of legal sanction. Although in England and Wales there is no statutory age at which it is illegal to leave your children unattended, a parent who is deemed to neglect, abandon or expose her children to danger can be liable to prosecution. According to Carolyn Hamilton of the Children's Legal Centre, the general view taken by child protection professionals is that a parent should not leave children under 12 alone for more than 20-30 minutes. What a shock this would have been to the parents of 'latch-key' youngsters in the 1970s. At that time debate about the children of working mothers returning from school to empty homes focused on whether it was right for women to have jobs which deprived their children of a welcoming smile and the smell of home baking. The issue was not seen as one of child safety and certainly not abandonment. Yet today's legal experts advise that, while parents are unlikely to face prosecution for a 30-minute absence, the parent of an 11-year-old left alone for three to four hours might face legal action. Even though very few parents are prosecuted in these circumstances, the strict guidelines convey a clear message about what society expects of parents. And that expectation is founded on the premise that parents can never do too much to protect their children.</p> <p> Twenty or thirty years ago, authors of child-rearing manuals had their own way of making parents feel guilty. But they would have reacted with disbelief to the proposition that it was wrong to leave children under 12 alone for more than 20-30 minutes. Fortunately, there are still some societies where the over-protective parent is not promoted as role model. Children in Norway and Finland 'enjoy being at home without their parents from about seven onwards' records Priscilla Alderson, a Reader in Childhood Studies at the Institute of Education in London. According to Alderson, Finnish children start school at 7 years, and sometimes go home at 11 a.m. where they play with friends until their parents arrive home in the late afternoon. In Anglo-American societies, where a paranoid parenting style prevails, such practices would be condemned as child abuse.</p> <p> The view that children cannot survive without the constant presence of a responsible adult is continually reinforced by public campaigns designed to frighten parents. 'Only use baby-sitters who are over 16 and responsible enough to look after your children' warned the NSPCC during its August Safe Open Spaces campaign. Even the time-honoured practice of using 14- or 15-year-olds eager to earn some pocket money through helping parents and dads look after their children is now dismissed as an act of gross irresponsibility.</p> <p> Today's parenting style sees safety and caution as intrinsic virtues.Paranoid parenting involves more than exaggerating the dangers facing children. It is driven by the constant expectation that something really bad is likely to happen to your youngster.</p> <p> Jacqueline Lang, Headmistress of Walthamstow Hall School in Sevenoaks, Kent, has characterized today's parenting style as 'the worst-case scenario approach'. Lang caught the public imagination in 1997 when she remarked to the local media that 'some girls in her school did not own a raincoat because they were ferried everywhere by car'. She identified one of the fundamental principles of paranoid parenting: the fear of taking risks. Her students' parents were simply too scared to allow their girls to walk to school. Children who are strangers to the outdoors do not need raincoats.</p> <p> Apprehension about child safety, and a morbid expectation that something terrible can happen any moment, mean that many risks that are well worth taking because of their stimulating effect on a child's development are simply avoided. Child-rearing today is not so much about managing the risks of everyday life, but avoiding them altogether. As child psychologist Jennie Linden argues, the adult 'preoccupation with risk can create too much emphasis on removing every conceivable source of even minor risk'. The characteristic feature of such an obsession is, according to Linden, 'to speculate excessively on what can go wrong rather than on what children may learn.' It is this precautionary approach which defines the parenting culture of contemporary society.</p> <p> Parents have always been concerned about protecting their children form harm. Asking 'What can go wrong?' is a sensible way of dealing with the many new experiences children encounter. To weigh up probabilities before doing something is an informed way of managing risk. But asking what can go wrong is very different from acting on the assumption that things will go wrong. Such a fatalistic outlook reduces the power of parents to make informed, intelligent judgements. A more appropriate approach might be to follow an assessment of what can go wrong with two other questions - 'Does it matter?' and 'What might the child learn from the experience?' The precautionary approach continually encourages adults to adopt the same one-dimensional response: Beware!</p> <p> It is tempting to interpret the precautionary approach to child- rearing as the irrational reaction of individual mothers and fathers. Child professionals sometimes point the finger at over-anxious parents and advise them to be more sensible about managing the risks their children face. Jacqueline Lang, who is exceptionally sensitive to the consequences of trying to 'inoculate' children against the risks thrown up by life, blames 'a generation of timid parents' for 'stifling the sense of adventure' of Britain's children. However, it is a mistake to reduce the problem to the personalities of some parents. How individual adults relate to their infants at any time is inseparable from the parenting style encouraged by our culture and society.</p> <p> Parents today face strong social pressures to adopt a precautionary approach towards child-rearing. Intimidating public campaigns endlessly remind them about the many risks their children face. It is difficult to retain a sense of perspective when the safety of children has become a permanent item of news.</p> <p><strong>The erosion of adult solidarity</strong></p> <p> Christina Hardyment, in her excellent study on baby-care advice past and present, is struck by the intensity of parental paranoia today. She senses a climate of permanent panic that invites a guilt-ridden style of parenting. The loss of small children's freedom is one consequence.' Children's freedom has never been restricted as it is today. A study by Dr Mayer Hillman of the Policy Studies Institute indicates that while 80 per cent of 7- and 8-year-olds went to school by themselves in 1970, fewer than 10 per cent are now allowed to do so. In the past, not even the archetypal over-anxious parent would have taken the precautionary approach that is now seen as the norm. Even though children have never been safer or healthier, at no time has so much concern and energy been devoted to protecting youngsters from harm.</p> <p> A Glasgow researcher, Stuart Waiton, has produced compelling evidence that counters the fear that children are at greater risk than in previous times. According to Waiton, between 1988 and 1999 the number of children murdered between the ages of and 16 decreased in England and Wales from 4 per million to 3 per million. The total murdered under the age of 5 dropped from 12 per million to 9 per million. Cases of abduction in which the offender was found guilty dropped from 26 to 8 over the same period.</p> <p> Although surveys confirm that paranoid parenting is widespread, there has been little attempt to understand its causes. The most common explanation is that it is all the fault of the sensationalist media. Panics about children's safety are interpreted as 'media-led' and television is accused of making parents unnecessarily apprehensive. 'Increasingly, we are bombarded by the news media with spectacular accounts of violence, illness and health concerns, as well as varied opinions about appropriate diets and child rearing practices', concluded the authors of one study of parental worries in the United States. They certainly have a point. Research into the British media's reporting of the horrific murder of 2-year-old Jamie Bulger by two 10-year-old boys shows that it had a major impact on parents. In a survey of 1,000 parents taken a year later, 97 percent cited the possible abduction of their children as their greatest fear. The Times reported that many of these parents revealed that 'video images of the two-year-old being taken by his killers were still fresh in their minds'.</p> <p> So yes, the media helps shape adults' perception of the risks faced by children. But it is far too simplistic to blame the media for the problems of parenting. Parents do not need high-profile media horror stories to provoke their insecurities. They worry about all manner of everyday things, all of the time. They can be anxious about Mary's weight on Monday, Tim's refusal to eat vegetables on Tuesday, the poor state of Mary's and Tim's education on Wednesday, and so on. A heightened sense of insecurity can attach itself to relatively mundane experiences such as whether a child is too fat or too thin. The media does not cause paranoid parenting. Its main role is to amplify society's concerns, to give shape to our fears. Confusing the messenger with the bad news is an understandable reaction, but not one that will help illuminate the issues at stake.</p> <p> So what is the bad news? In the chapters that follow, it should become clear that a variety of influences help to shape contemporary anxieties about parenting. But if one thing above all others has created the conditions for today's parenting crisis, it is the breakdown of adult solidarity.</p> <p> Adult solidarity is one of those used to take for granted. Most of the time, in most places, adult solidarity is practised by people who have never heard of the term. In most communities throughout the world adults assume a modicum of public responsibility for the welfare of children even if they have no ties to them. When the local newsagent or butcher scolds a child for dropping a chewing-gum wrapper on the road, they are actively assisting that boy's parents in the process of socialization. When a pensioner reprimands a young girl for crossing the road when the light is red, he is backing up her parents' attempt to teach, her the ways of the world. These displays of public responsibility teach children that certain behaviour is expected by the entire community, and not just by their mum and dad.</p> <p> It has long been recognized that the socialization of children relies on a wide network of responsible adults. Parents cannot be expected to act as 24-hour-a-day chaperones. Across cultures and throughout history, mothers and fathers have acted on the assumption that if their children got into trouble, other adults - often strangers - would help out. In many societies adults feel duty-bound to reprimand other people's children who misbehave in public.</p> <p> As every parent knows, in Britain today, fathers and mothers cannot rely on other adults to take responsibility for looking after their children. British adults are hesitant to engage with other people's youngsters. This reluctance to assume responsibility for the welfare of the young is not simply a matter of selfishness or indifference. Many adults fear that their action would be misunderstood and resented, perhaps even misinterpreted as abuse. Adults feel uncomfortable in the presence of children. They don't want to get involved and, even when confronted by a child in distress, are uncertain about how to behave.</p> <p> Take the following scene in a primary school in Bristol during the spring of 2000. The teachers have organized a group of 7-year-olds to go outside the schoolyard to count the cars that pass by. Little Henry is bored and proceeds to poke his head through the railings that separate the schoolyard from the street. He gets his head stuck. The teachers are at a loss to know what to do. A crowd gathers around the trapped child. One teacher finds a jar of cream and applies some of it on the railing to help Henry wriggle out of his predicament. It doesn't work. Parents begin to arrive to pick up the children. The teachers are standing around. Not one of them has attempted to pull Henry out. Not one of them has put an arm around the distressed boy in an act of reassurance. They are afraid of touching the child. Finally, Henry's mum arrives. She takes one look at her son, grabs hold of him, gives him a yank and he is out. Henry's 80-minute ordeal is over.</p> <p> The story was recounted to me in horror by a young teacher, as a statement about the world we live in. When I asked why she hadn't done something to help little Henry, she said that she had already been reprimanded a year earlier for being 'too physical' with one of her pupils.</p> <p> When we live in a society that warns off teachers, traditionally seen as being in loco parentis, it is hardly surprising that strangers hesitate before becoming involved with other people's children. If a teacher is not allowed to cuddle a crying child for fear of the action being misinterpreted, no wonder that passers-by will turn their backs on a weeping infant.</p> <p> Awkward adults uncomfortable in the company of children represent a serious problem for parents. Mothers and fathers feel that they are on their own. Worse, many parents are convinced that it is best if other adults don't interfere in their children's affairs. Parents regard other people not as allies, but as potentially predatory on their young ones. Clumsy adults inept at relating to children and anxious parents concerned about 'stranger-danger' are two sides of the same coin.</p> <p> This breakdown in adult solidarity breeds parental paranoia. The fear of the 'other person' is the most tangible expression of parental insecurity. A 1998 survey carried out by Families for Freedom noted that 89.5 per cent of the respondents had a general sense of foreboding about the safety of their children. This general sense of alarm became more focused when other adults were brought into the equation. It was said by 76 per cent that they were 'very worried' about their children's safety in relation to 'other people'. The other person is the stranger. Research carried out by Mary Joshi and Morag Maclean in 1995 found that more parents gave 'stranger-danger' as a reason for using cars for school journeys than any other reason.</p> <p> Perhaps that is why parents in Britain are more likely to drive their children to school than in Germany, Scandinavia and other parts of Europe where the distance between home and school may be far greater. In societies where neighbours and other adults assume a degree of responsibility for keeping an eye on children, attitudes towards their safety are far less obsessive. A comparative study of children's independent mobility concluded that there is far less parental supervision in Germany than the UK. According to the authors, one reason why German parents are more likely to allow children out on their own is because they expect other adults to keep an eye on them; in turn, German children reported feeling that they were watched over by the adult world. This culture of collaboration creates a sense of security for German parents. The expectation that other adults will do the right thing helps them to take a more relaxed attitude towards letting their children out of the door than might be the case in Britain. One consequence of the erosion of adult solidarity in Britain is that the distance that children are allowed to stray from home has been reduced to one-ninth of what it was in 1970.</p> <p><strong>A poisonous atmosphere for parenting</strong></p> <p> The finger points not only at other adults; British parents themselves have also come under suspicion. The public is frequently warned that children are at risk from their own parents. Parents who find it difficult to deal with the pressures of everyday life have been portrayed as potential abusers. In May 2000, the NSPCC launched its Full Stop campaign. Shocking pictures on billboards show a loving mother playing with her baby. The caption reads: 'Later she wanted to hold a pillow over his face.' Another picture highlights a loving father cuddling his baby. The words 'that night he felt like slamming her against the cot' serve as a chilling reminder not to be deceived by appearances. The NSPCC justified its scaremongering tactics on the grounds that it was telling parents that it is normal to snap under pressure, and that they need to learn to handle the strain. But this alleged link between parental incompetence and abusive behaviour has disturbing implications for every father and mother. If anyone can snap and smash the head of their baby against the wall, whom can you trust?</p> <p> It is easy for a mother or a father to lose control and lash out at their youngster. Regrettably most of us have done it on more than one occasion. Snapping under pressure is a normal is unfortunate fact of life. But when we snap we don't go on to smash our baby's head against the wall. It may be normal for parents to snap, but it is wrong for the NSPCC to suggest that this temporary loss of control 'normally' leads to abuse. The implication that parenting under pressure is an invitation to abuse is an insult to the integrity of millions of hardworking mothers and fathers. It also helps to create a poisonous atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust.</p> <p> A booklet Protecting our Children: A Guide for Parents, sponsored by Labour MP Dan Norris and with a foreword by Prime Minister Tony Blair, explains that anybody might be a paedophile. 'They live in our communities, in our families and may even be someone we know and love', the booklet informs the reader. 'How can seemingly kind and even respectable people abuse children' it asks?' Anyone reading this book is invited to look at people 'we know and love' with a newly suspicious eye. If it is indeed the case that anyone and everyone in our communities and our families should be treated with caution, then trust and collaboration between adults become impossible.</p> <p> Family life, once idealized as a haven from a heartless world, is now widely depicted as a site of domestic violence and abuse. Child protection professionals and press commentators are always warning of the dangers that children face from their 'normal' parents. If victimization within the family is pandemic then clearly we are obliged to mistrust even those closest to us. The focus of anxiety can no longer be the alien stranger or criminal, but our closest family relations, neighbours, friends, lovers and workmates. Such a suspicious attitude towards everyday life redefines how people are expected to relate to those closest to them. This culture of fear places parents in a difficult position. Every year some 120,000 parents experience the nightmare of being wrongly accused of child abuse.' Since normal parents are now portrayed as potential abusers, it is not surprising that so many face investigation on the basis of hearsay and rumour.</p> <p> Scare campaigns that target parents represent a body blow to the authority of every mother and father. Here and there, public figures still pay lip service to the 'great job' performed by parents. But the ceaseless reminders of parental failure take their toll. Campaigns which claim that it is normal for parents to snap and abuse permeate the public imagination, and incite us to be suspicious of our neighbours. When even nice mothers and fathers are potential monsters it is difficult to regard parents in a positive light. Everyone now feels entitled to speculate about what Mary's dad is up to. Under this pressure, parents will openly criticize other mothers and fathers - sometimes in front of the children. A society that expects parents to teach children to avoid strangers and to regard them with dread is storing up big problems for the future. When parents instruct children about stranger-danger these days, they are also communicating a negative statement about the adult world - and, by implication, about themselves.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The precautionary approach to parenting Parental paranoia today is more than simply a worse version of past anxieties. For instance, a common target of child-rearing manuals before the Second World War was the over-protective parent, and guilt-ridden parents worried that they might be 'smothering' their children. But how many times do we hear parents criticized for being over-protective today? Indeed, many of the traits associated with the classic over-protective father or mother are likely to be praised by today's child experts as responsible parenting. Parents are continually urged to do even more to protect their children. Researchers advise parents to supervise children, not only outdoors, but even when they watch television. The term 'coviewing' has been coined to describe the practice of hands-on parents playing the role of a 'media value filter and a media educator'. Other researchers further, claim that parental supervision inoculates children from many of the dangers they face. They contend that 'parental monitoring has been inversely associated with antisocial behaviour, drug use, tobacco use and early sexual activity'. There is obviously some truth in this. The more time a child spends in the company of his or her parents the less time is available for smoking, drinking and sex. But to equate the amount of parental supervision directly with behavioural outcomes tells parents that the more time they manage to spend with their children, the better their offspring will be. This raises the question of where to draw the line. How do parents decide how much monitoring is reasonably required, as opposed to optimally possible? Unfortunately, parental supervision is today always interpreted as a positive virtue so parents can never spend too much time supervising their youngsters. Child-rearing experts occasionally concede that it is simply impossible to keep children and young teenagers under constant adult supervision. But even then they insist that alternative, indirect, forms of child surveillance are employed. One American expert argues that if a child has to be left under self-care, then parents must do whatever they can to supervise in absentia, by liaising with a trusted adult who knows what the youngster is up to. The message is clear: if you are going to shirk your responsibility towards your child even for a few hours, you must at least make sure that somebody else is doing your job for you. Parents are not just advised to supervise their children. In Britain, such advice contains the implicit threat of legal sanction. Although in England and Wales there is no statutory age at which it is illegal to leave your children unattended, a parent who is deemed to neglect, abandon or expose her children to danger can be liable to prosecution. According to Carolyn Hamilton of the Children's Legal Centre, the general view taken by child protection professionals is that a parent should not leave children under 12 alone for more than 20-30 minutes. What a shock this would have been to the parents of 'latch-key' youngsters in the 1970s. At that time debate about the children of working mothers returning from school to empty homes focused on whether it was right for women to have jobs which deprived their children of a welcoming smile and the smell of home baking. The issue was not seen as one of child safety and certainly not abandonment. Yet today's legal experts advise that, while parents are unlikely to face prosecution for a 30-minute absence, the parent of an 11-year-old left alone for three to four hours might face legal action. Even though very few parents are prosecuted in these circumstances, the strict guidelines convey a clear message about what society expects of parents. And that expectation is founded on the premise that parents can never do too much to protect their children. Twenty or thirty years ago, authors of child-rearing manuals had their own way of making parents feel guilty. But they would have reacted with disbelief to the proposition that it was wrong to leave children under 12 alone for more than 20-30 minutes. Fortunately, there are still some societies where the over-protective parent is not promoted as role model. Children in Norway and Finland 'enjoy being at home without their parents from about seven onwards' records Priscilla Alderson, a Reader in Childhood Studies at the Institute of Education in London. According to Alderson, Finnish children start school at 7 years, and sometimes go home at 11 a.m. where they play with friends until their parents arrive home in the late afternoon. In Anglo-American societies, where a paranoid parenting style prevails, such practices would be condemned as child abuse. The view that children cannot survive without the constant presence of a responsible adult is continually reinforced by public campaigns designed to frighten parents. 'Only use baby-sitters who are over 16 and responsible enough to look after your children' warned the NSPCC during its August Safe Open Spaces campaign. Even the time-honoured practice of using 14- or 15-year-olds eager to earn some pocket money through helping parents and dads look after their children is now dismissed as an act of gross irresponsibility. Today's parenting style sees safety and caution as intrinsic virtues.Paranoid parenting involves more than exaggerating the dangers facing children. It is driven by the constant expectation that something really bad is likely to happen to your youngster. Jacqueline Lang, Headmistress of Walthamstow Hall School in Sevenoaks, Kent, has characterized today's parenting style as 'the worst-case scenario approach'. Lang caught the public imagination in 1997 when she remarked to the local media that 'some girls in her school did not own a raincoat because they were ferried everywhere by car'. She identified one of the fundamental principles of paranoid parenting: the fear of taking risks. Her students' parents were simply too scared to allow their girls to walk to school. Children who are strangers to the outdoors do not need raincoats. Apprehension about child safety, and a morbid expectation that something terrible can happen any moment, mean that many risks that are well worth taking because of their stimulating effect on a child's development are simply avoided. Child-rearing today is not so much about managing the risks of everyday life, but avoiding them altogether. As child psychologist Jennie Linden argues, the adult 'preoccupation with risk can create too much emphasis on removing every conceivable source of even minor risk'. The characteristic feature of such an obsession is, according to Linden, 'to speculate excessively on what can go wrong rather than on what children may learn.' It is this precautionary approach which defines the parenting culture of contemporary society. Parents have always been concerned about protecting their children form harm. Asking 'What can go wrong?' is a sensible way of dealing with the many new experiences children encounter. To weigh up probabilities before doing something is an informed way of managing risk. But asking what can go wrong is very different from acting on the assumption that things will go wrong. Such a fatalistic outlook reduces the power of parents to make informed, intelligent judgements. A more appropriate approach might be to follow an assessment of what can go wrong with two other questions - 'Does it matter?' and 'What might the child learn from the experience?' The precautionary approach continually encourages adults to adopt the same one-dimensional response: Beware! It is tempting to interpret the precautionary approach to child- rearing as the irrational reaction of individual mothers and fathers. Child professionals sometimes point the finger at over-anxious parents and advise them to be more sensible about managing the risks their children face. Jacqueline Lang, who is exceptionally sensitive to the consequences of trying to 'inoculate' children against the risks thrown up by life, blames 'a generation of timid parents' for 'stifling the sense of adventure' of Britain's children. However, it is a mistake to reduce the problem to the personalities of some parents. How individual adults relate to their infants at any time is inseparable from the parenting style encouraged by our culture and society. Parents today face strong social pressures to adopt a precautionary approach towards child-rearing. Intimidating public campaigns endlessly remind them about the many risks their children face. It is difficult to retain a sense of perspective when the safety of children has become a permanent item of news. The erosion of adult solidarity Christina Hardyment, in her excellent study on baby-care advice past and present, is struck by the intensity of parental paranoia today. She senses a climate of permanent panic that invites a guilt-ridden style of parenting. The loss of small children's freedom is one consequence.' Children's freedom has never been restricted as it is today. A study by Dr Mayer Hillman of the Policy Studies Institute indicates that while 80 per cent of 7- and 8-year-olds went to school by themselves in 1970, fewer than 10 per cent are now allowed to do so. In the past, not even the archetypal over-anxious parent would have taken the precautionary approach that is now seen as the norm. Even though children have never been safer or healthier, at no time has so much concern and energy been devoted to protecting youngsters from harm. A Glasgow researcher, Stuart Waiton, has produced compelling evidence that counters the fear that children are at greater risk than in previous times. According to Waiton, between 1988 and 1999 the number of children murdered between the ages of and 16 decreased in England and Wales from 4 per million to 3 per million. The total murdered under the age of 5 dropped from 12 per million to 9 per million. Cases of abduction in which the offender was found guilty dropped from 26 to 8 over the same period. Although surveys confirm that paranoid parenting is widespread, there has been little attempt to understand its causes. The most common explanation is that it is all the fault of the sensationalist media. Panics about children's safety are interpreted as 'media-led' and television is accused of making parents unnecessarily apprehensive. 'Increasingly, we are bombarded by the news media with spectacular accounts of violence, illness and health concerns, as well as varied opinions about appropriate diets and child rearing practices', concluded the authors of one study of parental worries in the United States. They certainly have a point. Research into the British media's reporting of the horrific murder of 2-year-old Jamie Bulger by two 10-year-old boys shows that it had a major impact on parents. In a survey of 1,000 parents taken a year later, 97 percent cited the possible abduction of their children as their greatest fear. The Times reported that many of these parents revealed that 'video images of the two-year-old being taken by his killers were still fresh in their minds'. So yes, the media helps shape adults' perception of the risks faced by children. But it is far too simplistic to blame the media for the problems of parenting. Parents do not need high-profile media horror stories to provoke their insecurities. They worry about all manner of everyday things, all of the time. They can be anxious about Mary's weight on Monday, Tim's refusal to eat vegetables on Tuesday, the poor state of Mary's and Tim's education on Wednesday, and so on. A heightened sense of insecurity can attach itself to relatively mundane experiences such as whether a child is too fat or too thin. The media does not cause paranoid parenting. Its main role is to amplify society's concerns, to give shape to our fears. Confusing the messenger with the bad news is an understandable reaction, but not one that will help illuminate the issues at stake. So what is the bad news? In the chapters that follow, it should become clear that a variety of influences help to shape contemporary anxieties about parenting. But if one thing above all others has created the conditions for today's parenting crisis, it is the breakdown of adult solidarity. Adult solidarity is one of those used to take for granted. Most of the time, in most places, adult solidarity is practised by people who have never heard of the term. In most communities throughout the world adults assume a modicum of public responsibility for the welfare of children even if they have no ties to them. When the local newsagent or butcher scolds a child for dropping a chewing-gum wrapper on the road, they are actively assisting that boy's parents in the process of socialization. When a pensioner reprimands a young girl for crossing the road when the light is red, he is backing up her parents' attempt to teach, her the ways of the world. These displays of public responsibility teach children that certain behaviour is expected by the entire community, and not just by their mum and dad. It has long been recognized that the socialization of children relies on a wide network of responsible adults. Parents cannot be expected to act as 24-hour-a-day chaperones. Across cultures and throughout history, mothers and fathers have acted on the assumption that if their children got into trouble, other adults - often strangers - would help out. In many societies adults feel duty-bound to reprimand other people's children who misbehave in public. As every parent knows, in Britain today, fathers and mothers cannot rely on other adults to take responsibility for looking after their children. British adults are hesitant to engage with other people's youngsters. This reluctance to assume responsibility for the welfare of the young is not simply a matter of selfishness or indifference. Many adults fear that their action would be misunderstood and resented, perhaps even misinterpreted as abuse. Adults feel uncomfortable in the presence of children. They don't want to get involved and, even when confronted by a child in distress, are uncertain about how to behave. Take the following scene in a primary school in Bristol during the spring of 2000.

Not one of them has put an arm around the distressed boy in an act of reassurance. They are afraid of touching the child. Finally, Henry's mum arrives. She takes one look at her son, grabs hold of him, gives him a yank and he is out. Henry's 80-minute ordeal is over. The story was recounted to me in horror by a young teacher, as a statement about the world we live in. When I asked why she hadn't done something to help little Henry, she said that she had already been reprimanded a year earlier for being 'too physical' with one of her pupils. When we live in a society that warns off teachers, traditionally seen as being in loco parentis, it is hardly surprising that strangers hesitate before becoming involved with other people's children. If a teacher is not allowed to cuddle a crying child for fear of the action being misinterpreted, no wonder that passers-by will turn their backs on a weeping infant.

Anyone reading this book is invited to look at people 'we know and love' with a newly suspicious eye. If it is indeed the case that anyone and everyone in our communities and our families should be treated with caution, then trust and collaboration between adults become impossible. Family life, once idealized as a haven from a heartless world, is now widely depicted as a site of domestic violence and abuse. Child protection professionals and press commentators are always warning of the dangers that children face from their 'normal' parents. If victimization within the family is pandemic then clearly we are obliged to mistrust even those closest to us. The focus of anxiety can no longer be the alien stranger or criminal, but our closest family relations, neighbours, friends, lovers and workmates. Such a suspicious attitude towards everyday life redefines how people are expected to relate to those closest to them. This culture of fear places parents in a difficult position. Every year some 120,000 parents experience the nightmare of being wrongly accused of child abuse.'

      "bodyText": "There needs to be a cultural change, both on the part of charities and funders, if widespread problems in funding the core costs of voluntary organisations are to be addressed, according to speakers at a Charityfair debate on core costs. Stephen Bubb, chief executive of the Association of Chief Executive of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo), said it was essential for charities to be more assertive with local authorities and other funders. Charities needed to be \"more upfront and shouldn't blush\" about asking for the full costs of projects to be covered, said Mr Bubb. Earlier this year Acevo relaunched its report on funding core costs, Funding our Future, which it hopes will continue to generate debate among charities and funders on how core costs can best be funded. Among the report's proposals is that charities adopt a business model of \"full project funding\" when dealing with funders. \"The problem is that charities have not used this model and so have had to go off and try and find other funding for the extra bits,\" said Mr Bubb, talking about issues such as the costs of staff development and central office resources. \"We should be telling the government, 'if you want these services this is what it costs.'\" For their part, he added, charities needed to be more transparent and accountable and ensure they had good management systems and practices. Toby Johns, director of the Baring Foundation, one of the few charitable trusts that funds core costs, advised charities to segment their funders when developing fundraising strategy. \"Most charitable trusts are interested in the work and causes rather than funding you as an organisation, so you need to look at what particular funders are interested in.\" He said charities needed to take a lead when applying for core costs as part of project funding by being aware of the need for transparency and issues such as how costs are allocated and the benchmarking of core costs. \"For example, [charities need to look at] what sort of overhead charge is reasonable during different stages of a project.\" The Baring Foundation decided to fund core costs in 1995, partly due to a belief that reliance on project funding meant many charities, while growing in income, had become fragile organisations. Mr Johns said one of the main arguments in favour of funding core costs today, was the importance of ensuring the voluntary sector maintained its independence at a time when there is a large degree of convergence with the state. Fundraising consultant Valerie Morton said charities needed to include overhead costs in their project funding applications, such as the proportion of time the chief executive and other managers would need to be involved. For example, she said, the personnel department would be involved in recruiting staff for a particular project and their time would have to be reflected in the overall project costs. She argued that one way forward was for charities to try and diversify their funding base and in particular to seek more unrestricted sources of income. \"Most legacies are unrestricted and so is most direct marketing income and payroll giving,\" she said. Corporate fundraising is another important area for funding core costs, she added. \"If a company's contribution is coming from its marketing budget they're not paying for a single project but for a package.\" If the charity can create a total package that reaches the target audience the company is seeking it can charge more, said Ms Morton. Mr Bubb also highlighted the need for more long-term funding: \"Local authorities usually only provide funding on a one-year basis but, when you're talking about long-term problems you need long-term funding.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong>Making Sense of Parental Paranoia</strong></p> <p>Tony is giving up teaching. Although he would not use the words, it was 'parental paranoia' that drove him out of the West Sussex primary school where he had taught for three years. During his teacher training, Tony had anticipated that he might be stretched by the challenge of dealing with rowdy children. But he was not prepared for the task of coping with 'difficult' anxious parents. The most taxing moments of his working life were to be spent dealing with 'worried mums'. He sighs as he tells of the mother who insisted on driving behind her son's coach to France to ensure that he arrived safely. He wearily recalls how a school trip to the seaside, planned for a class of 5-year-olds was cancelled because two parents were concerned that the trip would involve their children in a 45-minute journey in a private car. Would the cars be roadworthy? Who would accompany a child to the lavatory? Who would ensure correct fitting seat belts? Were these normally non-smoking cars, or would the children be made victims of passive smoking? The planned pirate's day on the beach ended up being confined to the school field - sea, sand and adventure confined to their imagination and many of its education aims undermined. Exasperated by 'problems - all in the minds of parents', Tony sought, and found, a career outside teaching.</p> <p> Of course, it is normal for parents to be concerned about the well-being of their children. Parental anxiety is nothing new. A brief inspection of the pages of The Nursery World from the 1920's and 1930's shows that our grandparents were haunted by many of the doubts, worries and preoccupations that torment fathers and mothers today. A frequently revised topic was: 'Is my child's development normal? Child tantrums, shyness, aggression, jealousy, thumb-sucking, nail-biting, refusal to sleep, were regularly raised in letters from concerned parents. Many begged an answer to what the publication's agony aunt called 'a problem as old as parenthood itself - that of how to get to obey us'.</p> <p> It might seem that not much has changed. But the superficial similarities betray some big differences, in the past, parental anxiety focused on the problems within the family. Infant health - physical, psychological and moral - was an important preoccupation as was preparing children for the outside world - school, career, marriage. And of course, the older generation was often anxious about their children falling in with bad company and generally 'getting up to no good'. But the concerns raised by our grandparents were voiced in a different tone from today.</p> <p> Reading the worries of parents published in the 1920s, the overall impression is something like this: 'Family life is fine, but there is just this one little thing that we need to sort out.' Today the discussions in parenting magazines suggests that family life is far from fine, that most parents feel out of control and that everything is up for question. Instead of a specific concern, parents seem to be suffering a more general loss of confidence.</p> <p> The parents who write in magazines today do not give the impression that they are troubled by one aspect of child-rearing. Many seem overwhelmed by the sheer scale of troublesome issues confronting them. These days it seems that every little issue - how to toilet-train a child, when you can leave them home alone, whether to force them to eat their greens - is made into a bigger problem by an overall crisis of parental nerve. This suggests that there must have been some major changes in the way that adults negotiate the task of looking after youngsters. The clearest symptom of this trend is the public panic about child safety.</p> <p> In recent years, no issue has come under close scrutiny than the question of children's safety. It has become so highly charged that a single incident can spark a major public debate and demands for new regulations. For example, the tragic murder of an English teenage girl while visiting France on an organized school exchange led to a major review of the safety of school trips - despite the fact that the incident was clearly a one-off event. There is no evidence of any increase in attacks on foreign (or French) students in France, and it is unlikely that such an attack will take place again regardless of whether the authorities take new precautionary measures or not. Such measures may make parents feel better, but a murderer intent on getting into a dormitory will probably do so as easily in France as he would in England. Thankfully, such outrages happen rarely - not because of security measures recommended by educational establishments, but because only a tiny number of people are motivated to commit such atrocities. In truth, a 15-year-old girl is probably far safer in a dormitory in St Gerbais than in her 18-year-old boyfriend's Ford Fiesta on the M25.</p> <p> Public concern with safety has reached obsessive proportions. The remote possibility that children might choke on small toys in packets of cereals, chocolates and crisps has provoked demands to ban them. There is no evidence that any child has ever choked to death - but the theoretical possibility that one just might do so one day in undeniable, and that is sufficient to justify the call for a ban. Baby walkers, which have been used for years to allow infants to whiz about before they can walk alone, have been condemned because of the possibility that children may topple over or fall down the stairs. Admittedly this danger is more 'real' than that of death by Pokemon-card ingestion, but it is still triggered by the potential risk that something might happen, and not by specific evidence that it has.</p> <p> Once in place, parental paranoia easily attaches itself to any new experience concerning children. Take in vitro fertilization (IVF) - for many the only root to parenthood. Rather than celebrating the potential of IVF to cerate wanted children, researches have recently warned about hypothetical dangers to the children being given life. There have been warnings that IVF could induce changes in children's genetic make-up and impair their mental development. There has been speculation about whether sperm that have to be assisted to fertilize an egg will produce babies as healthy as sperm that can swim on their own. Psychologists muse about whether people who become parents by artificial means after years of infertility will be able to relate, in an emotionally stable manner, to their much-wanted children. It has even been suggested that IVF children will be loved too much and may not be able to live up to their parents' hopes for them. It is only a matter of time before the fertile imagination succeeds in turning IVF into a child safety issue.</p> <p> The internet has a remarkable potential to enhance young people's lives by providing educational opportunities. Yet it is widely seen as another new technology that poses new dangers to children. Much of the discussion about the World Wide Web has focused on how to protect young people from the perils, to prevent innocents stumbling across 'adult' sites or into the clutches of paedophiles. 'The Internet can be a big and dangerous place for children, but for the price of a phone call, it needn't be', promises a newspaper advertisement for an Internet provider specializing in protecting children in cyberspace. Such manipulative marketing schemes are confident that they can convert parental paranoia into hard cash.</p> <p> Sadly, virtual reality provides infinite space for the exercise of the anxious imagination, an unknown world where our fear of invisible strangers can run riot. Since children are often more adept at negotiating the net, parental control is forced to confront uncomfortable new challenges. 'You don't know what's out there', a group of fathers confided in me. One raised the spectre of paedophile rings lurking in the shadows online, ready to pounce on his unsuspecting teenagers by e-mail. Nobody I talked to had actually heard of any child being damaged, but nevertheless they regarded the Internet as a really big problem. As one parents' guide to the Internet warns: 'You might think you have taken adequate steps to protect your child, but please be aware that a determined child might nonetheless be able to circumvent any protective software or security measure. And apparently there are other risks to worry about. A London conference on parenting in April 2000 was informed by Dr Jane Healy, and American educational psychologist, that computers can also damage children's brain development.</p> <p> Old-fashioned television is often indicted for its negative impact on children. Parents complain that television is teaching their children to be violent shopaholics. They protest that video games distract children form reading or riding a bike. Even parents who rely on the VCR to keep their children busy feel guilty about their pragmatic embrace of the electronic baby-sitter. The experts encourage these concerns. One American study warns that the impact of the media on children 'should be eliciting serious concern, not just from parents and educators but from physicians, public health advocates, and politicians as well'. Parents are encouraged to blame television because, in a world where they already feel pretty powerless, yet another outside influence on their children is experienced as a threat to their authority.</p> <p> Parents mistrust the Internet and television because of a more general unease about having to cope with external influences that bear upon their children. Many of these influences - television advertising, consumerism, the Internet - are portrayed as part of a complex new world that is causing parental insecurity. But adult over-reaction to new technology is a symptom, and not the cause of the problem. Many parents now feel so insecure and fearful of what they do not understand that virtually anything can be turned into a potential childcare crisis.</p> <p> Fear of children's safety has come to dominate the parenting landscape. In 1998 the advocacy group Families for Freedom interviewed 200 parents. The results make frightening reading. Most of these parents paint a picture of a world that is hostile territory for their children. They routinely use words like 'scared' and 'frightened' to describe their feelings about their children, particularly where they are outdoors. When the marketing organization System Three surveyed public opinion on the safety of children in Scotland for the BBC in 1998, the results suggested an overwhelming sense that children were far less safe than 20 years ago. Although the incidence of child murder by a stranger in Scotland is very low and has shown no change in the past 20 years, 76 per cent of respondents thought that there had been an increase in such tragedies, while 38 per cent believed that the increase had been 'dramatic'. A large majority - 83 per cent - also thought that more children were now being knocked down by traffic on the roads of Scotland. In fact the incidence of road injuries to children had decreased by 60 per cent during the previous 20 years. The gap between adult perceptions and the reality of the risks faced by children is confirmed by other studies in the Anglo-American world. A survey of US paediatricians carried out in 1995 claimed that parental anxieties tended to be significantly out of proportion to many real risks. The discrepancy between actual and imagined risks was particularly striking in relation to the dramatic issues of child welfare, such as abduction, environmental poisons and cancer.</p> <p> A culture of fear has led parents to restrict their children's independent outdoor activities. In 1971, eight out of ten 8-year-olds were allowed to walk to school alone. Now it is fewer than one in ten. At age II almost every child used to walk, now it is down to 55 per cent and falling. A report published by the Children's Play Council in 1997 argued that children had become virtual prisoners in their own homes.</p> <p> Paranoid parenting does not only restrict children's freedom to play. It also diminishes the creative aspect of play. There is considerable evidence that children are more creative when their parents are not around to monitor their behaviour. A study by Dale Grubb and Alicia Snyder concludes that adult supervision turns play into a structured activity and that this weakens youngsters' drive to experiment. Unfortunately, the concept of unsupervised children's activity - what used to be called play - is now defined by child professionals as a risk. Restricting children's outdoor activity has predictable consequences for their development, and a sedentary lifestyle is inevitably bad for their health. Research has linked the decline in British children's fitness to the decrease in the amount of time they spend walking and cycling. The First National Travel Survey reported a fall of about 20 per cent in the annual distance walked and 27 per cent in the distance cycled by children between 1985 and 1993. An average British schoolgirl now walks for less than seven minutes a day. Deprived of the opportunity to burn calories by racing around outside, children grow fat. A study published in the British Medical Journal in September found an alarming proportion of pre-school children to be overweight and even obese. Among those aged 2, 15.8 per cent were considered overweight and 6 per cent obese. By the time they reached 5, 18.7 were deemed overweight and 7.2 per cent obese.</p>",

An average British schoolgirl now walks for less than seven minutes a day. Deprived of the opportunity to burn calories by racing around outside, children grow fat. A study published in the British Medical Journal in September found an alarming proportion of pre-school children to be overweight and even obese. Among those aged 2, 15.8 per cent were considered overweight and 6 per cent obese. By the time they reached 5, 18.7 were deemed overweight and 7.2 per cent obese.",

      "bodyText": "The age-old rivalry between Russia and Turkey over influence in the strategic near-east regions of the Caucasus, the Black sea, and the Caspian basin is feeding increasingly into the bloody Chechnya conflict, deepening mistrust on both sides of the Bosphorus. The Turkish foreign minister, Ismail Cem, arrived in Russia today for a four-day visit during which his hosts are certain to give him an earful about perceived Turkish support for pro-Chechen ''terrorists'' and ''extremists'' following this week's hostage drama at a posh Istanbul hotel. When 13 pro-Chechen gunmen took over the Swissotel and held 120 guests and staff hostage for 12 hours, it was the second major act of anti-Russian violence in Istanbul in two months. Last month Chechen gunmen hijacked a Russian aircraft from Istanbul to Saudi Arabia. Three people were killed when Saudi special forces eventually stormed the plane in Medina and freed the hostages. Mohammed Tokcan, a Turk of ethnic Chechen origin who was the ringleader of this week's hostage-taking, was also involved in the 1996 hijacking of a Russian passenger ferry from the Turkish port of Trabzon to the Russian Black sea resort of Sochi. Of the nine men involved in the ship hijack, four, including Tokcan, quickly escaped from jail after being sentenced. After being re-arrested, Tokcan was then amnestied last December. To Russian eyes, such events smack not just of leniency towards convicted hijackers or turning a blind eye to their operations, but of outright complicity with ''terrorists'' in the interests of the Turkish state. In the clash between big Russian nationalism and Chechen separatism, the Turks are broadly sympathetic to their co-religionist Muslim Chechens, whose language is also Turkic. Chechen refugees are welcome in Turkey, where there are estimated to be some 5m people of Chechen origin. That diaspora, Moscow protests, has long been a breeding ground for Chechen guerrillas. The separatists, it is claimed, also undergo training and obtain or purchase weapons in Turkey. Ankara and Moscow have been sparring for centuries for control of the mineral-rich Caspian and Black sea regions. The Kremlin contends that the end of the Soviet Union and the weakening of Russia have boosted Turkish ambitions in the region and that Ankara is now engaged in a frantic cloak-and-dagger campaign to destabilise southern Russia. Russia and Turkey are on opposing sides of the contest to control the gas and oil deposits of the Caspian. As Nato's key south-eastern flank and window into the Middle East, Turkey is also viewed suspiciously in Moscow as a lynchpin of an expanding western alliance bent on encircling Russia. The Kremlin lines up behind Greece and the Greek side of partitioned Cyprus in the Aegean contest and the Kremlin sees Turkey as a troublesome proxy for America following a policy aimed at keeping Russia down. ''The interests of Turkish intelligence are quite clear,'' Vladimir Lutsenko, an ex-KGB officer, told a Moscow newspaper this week. ''They are expanding their influence in the Caucasus and working with the Americans who are extremely keen on weakening Russia. Turkish intelligence is more dependent on the CIA than on its own national leadership.'' According to official leaks to the Moscow press, the Turkish intelligence service, the MIT, has become highly active in southern Russia since the end of the cold war. If the bazaars of Istanbul exert a magnetic pull on hundreds of Russian traders migrating daily across the Bosphorus, the building sites of Moscow and southern Russia are fertile territory for Turkish workers and construction firms. The two-way traffic provides ample scope for espionage. The Moscow investigative reporter, Alexander Khinshteyn, disclosed this week that six Turkish agents were quietly arrested last year alone, most of them in the Stavropol region of southern Russia. Russian officials claim that the alleged Turkish agents operate largely without the knowledge of the civilian government in Ankara, but under the auspices of the Turkish military and secret service, with a remit to promote ''pan-Turkism'' among the millions of Turkic-speaking peoples of southern Russia.

      "body": "<p>An unprecedented shake-up of retail banking is on the cards after the unexpected announcement yesterday of \u00a327bn merger talks between Halifax and Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>News of their negotiations stunned the City and prompted speculation about the long-term future of Abbey National, already being courted by Lloyds TSB, and Alliance &amp; Leicester, which has been linked with National Australia Bank. </p> <p>The surprise negotiations - announced yesterday after reports of the talks leaked - appeared to represent a u-turn by Halifax following its boasts of remaining independent. The disclosure raised concerns about job cuts in the combined 57,000 workforce. </p> <p>There is added uncertainty about whether the head office will be located in Halifax or Edinburgh although early indications are that the England-based bank is ready to make substantial concessions to Scottish national sentiment. </p> <p>BoS has suffered two humiliating defeats in as many years in its attempts to merge and has been seen as an obvious takeover target - perhaps for NAB, which already owns Scotland's Clydesdale. </p> <p>If details can be agreed between Halifax, which initiated the talks, and BoS, the combined bank would create a \"fifth force\" on the high street and save \u00a3300m a year. </p> <p>The combined bank would rival the big four - Lloyds TSB, Barclays, HSBC and NatWest/Royal Bank of Scotland - but a senior industry source last night stressed that the talks were not complete. He described them as \"live, serious and continuing\". </p> <p>News of the talks increased the pressure on BoS and Halifax to reach an agreement quickly. Shares in both banks jumped as much as 8%, in part on expectation that their merger talks might be spoiled by intervention from other financial players such as NAB, Barclays and HSBC. </p> <p>Halifax's shares ended 30p higher at 768p, still below the 774p at which they made their debut on the stock market four year ago, while BoS gained 61p to 803p. Abbey National, with which BoS tried to seal a deal last year only to see Lloyds TSB wade in, also gained. </p> <p>Some City analysts predicted that the Halifax/BoS talks would increase the chances that Lloyds TSB's stalled \u00a318bn bid for Abbey would be cleared by the competition commission when it reports to the Department of Trade and Industry in June. </p> <p>One senior City source expressed surprise that BoS had entered into merger talks with Halifax while the outcome of that competition commission inquiry, regarded as crucial to the future framework of the banking industry, was unknown. The outcome might even clear the way for a resumption of talks between Abbey and BoS. </p> <p>In a terse statement, Halifax and BoS said they were in talks \"regarding a potential merger of equals\", even though Halifax is worth some \u00a317bn and BoS \u00a310bn. </p> <p>They said the deal would be structured at a \"nil premium\" and involve a straight swap of shares, which raised concerns that investors would balk at the terms because they would want to receive some cash for their shares. </p> <p>Mark Thomas, analyst at investment bank Fox-Pitt, Kelton, put the chances of a deal being clinched at greater than 50-50 with potential problem areas being top jobs and location of the head office. </p> <p>Industry sources believe that, under the terms being discussed, leading operations would be retained in Halifax and Edinburgh. Control would be split between Halifax's youthful chief executive, James Crosby, and Peter Burt, the 56-year-old chief executive of BoS. BoS's annual results are due next week.</p>",

The surprise negotiations - announced yesterday after reports of the talks leaked - appeared to represent a u-turn by Halifax following its boasts of remaining independent. The disclosure raised concerns about job cuts in the combined 57,000 workforce. There is added uncertainty about whether the head office will be located in Halifax or Edinburgh although early indications are that the England-based bank is ready to make substantial concessions to Scottish national sentiment. BoS has suffered two humiliating defeats in as many years in its attempts to merge and has been seen as an obvious takeover target - perhaps for NAB, which already owns Scotland's Clydesdale. If details can be agreed between Halifax, which initiated the talks, and BoS, the combined bank would create a \"fifth force\" on the high street and save \u00a3300m a year. The combined bank would rival the big four - Lloyds TSB, Barclays, HSBC and NatWest/Royal Bank of Scotland - but a senior industry source last night stressed that the talks were not complete. He described them as \"live, serious and continuing\". News of the talks increased the pressure on BoS and Halifax to reach an agreement quickly. Shares in both banks jumped as much as 8%, in part on expectation that their merger talks might be spoiled by intervention from other financial players such as NAB, Barclays and HSBC. Halifax's shares ended 30p higher at 768p, still below the 774p at which they made their debut on the stock market four year ago, while BoS gained 61p to 803p. Abbey National, with which BoS tried to seal a deal last year only to see Lloyds TSB wade in, also gained. Some City analysts predicted that the Halifax/BoS talks would increase the chances that Lloyds TSB's stalled \u00a318bn bid for Abbey would be cleared by the competition commission when it reports to the Department of Trade and Industry in June. One senior City source expressed surprise that BoS had entered into merger talks with Halifax while the outcome of that competition commission inquiry, regarded as crucial to the future framework of the banking industry, was unknown. The outcome might even clear the way for a resumption of talks between Abbey and BoS. In a terse statement, Halifax and BoS said they were in talks \"regarding a potential merger of equals\", even though Halifax is worth some \u00a317bn and BoS \u00a310bn. They said the deal would be structured at a \"nil premium\" and involve a straight swap of shares, which raised concerns that investors would balk at the terms because they would want to receive some cash for their shares. Mark Thomas, analyst at investment bank Fox-Pitt, Kelton, put the chances of a deal being clinched at greater than 50-50 with potential problem areas being top jobs and location of the head office. Industry sources believe that, under the terms being discussed, leading operations would be retained in Halifax and Edinburgh. Control would be split between Halifax's youthful chief executive, James Crosby, and Peter Burt, the 56-year-old chief executive of BoS. BoS's annual results are due next week.",

It has forced the British government to take some action, however perfunctory, instead of doing nothing at all. And it has underscored the urgent need for the early convening of the UN's international criminal court, the permanent body that is intended to replace ad hoc tribunals like that in the Hague. Britain and many other countries are in the process of ratifying the Rome treaty that set up the ICC. When it finally comes into being, it is the ICC that will be the natural, impartial forum for hearing cases such as those pursued by Indict. Significantly for people such as Saddam, the ICC will not recognise the right to immunity from prosecution of serving or former heads of state. That the ICC is not already in being is due in some measure to opposition to it from the US government. Washington worries about future ICC prosecutions of members of the US armed forces on service overseas, and its opposition has encouraged other countries that also fear giving extraterritorial jurisdiction to the UN. The irony of this situation will not be lost on Saddam and Aziz, nor should it be ignored by the Bush administration. For it is the Iraqi dictator's staunchest foes who now increasingly appear to be the biggest obstacles in the way of eventually bringing him to justice. Scotland Yard will no doubt do its best. But the surest legal, non-military way of ending Saddam's tyranny is his indictment, arrest and trial before a court comprising all the nations of the world.

Debra Winger stars in husband Arliss Howard's Big Bad Love and Ethan Hawke directs Chelsea Walls with a strong cast including wife Uma Thurman. \"We saw a lot of American films and I turned down films by well-known directors,\" Macia said. \"When it came to choosing between theirs and first films of equal quality, I wanted to take the first-time features.\" The biggest name directors in the line-up are Amos Kollek, who featured at Cannes last year with Fast Food, Fast Women and Sandrine Veysset, who previously directed Will It Snow At Christmas? and this time opens the event with Martha...

Phoenix was adopted by the media as a heartbreaking symbol of the foot and mouth crisis after she was discovered alive under a pile of 15 culled animals.

I became a better player after coming to England under Arsene Wenger so why should I even consider leaving Arsenal?\" he told Football365. \"The people at this club know what is going to happen,\" he added. \"It is very clear to them that I want to stay at Arsenal.

Monthly spending on government advertising soared in March to more than \u00a330m - two-and-a-half times last year's level and almost a quarter of the total spent by the UK's top 20 advertisers combined. According to figures from media monitor AC Nielsen MMS, the most expensive government campaigns last month involved benefit fraud (\u00a33.4m), entitlements to annual leave (\u00a32.5m), anti-smoking initiatives (\u00a32.2m), the UK Online website (\u00a32.1m) and lone parents (\u00a31.2m). The figures prompted accusations the government was using taxpayers' money to fund campaigns trumpeting its achievements. During yesterday's prime minister's question time, William Hague slammed the benefit fraud campaign, calling it an expensive flop. \"The government's own evaluation concluded that... the result of the campaign was respondents perceived benefit fraud as easier to commit than they had thought previously,\" he said. He criticised the government for wasting money it could have spent on promoting Britain as a tourist destination to help the industry recover from the impact of foot and mouth disease.

      "bodyText": "Sir Christopher Bland was today facing pressure to stand down immediately as chairman of the BBC because of a potential conflict of interest. The calls follow this morning's announcement that he is to replace Sir Iain Vallance as chairman of BT. Liberal Democrats said Sir Christopher could not simultaneously head up the BBC's board of governors and be BT chairman. He will earn a double salary topping \u00a3400,000 for both jobs. \"Sir Christopher Bland can't possibly do two jobs at once. He cannot give the BBC his full attention if he believes the job is that part-time,\" said the party's culture spokesman, Norman Baker. \"It confirms the view that the BBC's board of governors is past its sell-by-date. \"There is a clear conflict of interest. The merging of telecommunications with traditional broadcasting will make the BBC and BT potential competitors. \"Sir Christopher must resign his position as chair of the board of governors,\" he added. Sir Christopher is currently paid \u00a372,000 a year at the BBC and at BT he stands to earn another \u00a3350,000 a year. Peter Mandelson, the Hartlepool MP and a former Labour party communications director, said of Sir Christopher's switch: \"I don't think there is any conflict of interest at all in this appointment. \"BBC journalists have clear editorial guidelines to work within, regardless of who the governors are. \"Much more important is maintaining a political balance at the top of the BBC during a general election period. \"Sir Christopher Bland has been an excellent chairman and is not exactly a Labour figure, while the vice-chairman, Gavyn Davies, has a clear Labour background. \"That is a balance that will continue to serve the BBC well, before a replacement for the chairman is found.\" BT's share price rose 2% in early trading this morning, up 10p to 590p. However, the price is far below last year's high of \u00a314.23. Greg Dyke, the director-general of the BBC, said: \"Christopher has been a strong champion and servant of the public interest and the BBC's independence in his stewardship over the last five years.\" Related stories 26.04.2001: comment by Emily Bell 26.04.2001: Sir Christopher quits to join BT 26.04.2001: BT shares fall on news 26.04.2001: BT's poisoned chalice awaits 23.04.2001: BT fights to tame \u00a330bn debt 20.03.2001: How BT got the numbers wrong 17.03.2001: Ailing giant rings the changes to survive 12.03.2001: BTs chiefs face ax 06.02.2001: BT's master unbundler takes centre stage MediaGuardian.co.uk special report The BBC Talk about it Can Bland save BT?

      "body": "<p>Sir Christopher Bland may have thought long and hard about his decision to take the reins at BT, but there will be no quick-fix solutions to help the beleaguered former state telecoms firm out of its current crisis. </p> <p>If anything, the top job at BT is just another poisoned chalice. One City analyst said this morning that Sir Christopher was jumping from the frying pan into the fire. </p> <p>While Sir Christopher is a perfect choice for the job on paper, given his experience of dealing with regulators, red tape and bureaucracy at the BBC and the trucking company, NFC, the City was hoping for fresh blood - someone to drive things forward rather than get bogged down in stonewalling. </p> <p>A massive task awaits Sir Christopher. The telecoms company has a \u00a330bn debt mountain - equal to almost all of its \u00a335bn stock market valuation - and had hoped to repay some of its loans by selling off parts of its business and demerging others as separate listed companies.</p> <p>Last night it finally managed to divest its stake in internet access provider LineOne, but for all its years of funding only received \u00a36.2m in cash and \u00a324.9m in Tiscali shares from the sale of the business. </p> <p>This morning it emerged that BT was close to issuing a record-breaking \u00a35bn rights issues to shore up its finances. Shareholders would be offered the opportunity to buy new shares at a big discount. </p> <p>The rights issue was first mooted in March and BT has since been talking to fund managers to gauge City reaction. The feeling is that the City would support a cash call, but only if Sir Iain Vallance and Sir Peter Bonfield left the company.</p> <p>Gone are the days when BT was the stock market darling. Its value has tumbled by 61% in the past year, from \u00a315 a year ago to \u00a35.40 today. </p> <p>And, although hard to imagine, some commentators believe the company, which was once a utility just like water and gas companies, could disappear altogether unless radical steps are taken. </p> <p>Sir Iain, who is also chairman of the Confederation of British Industry, and Sir Peter are viewed as jointly responsible for the company's predicament, and today cries of scapegoat accompanied news of Sir Iain's departure. </p> <p>BT is no longer the global telecoms giant it once was.

      "bodyText": "Sir Christopher Bland may have thought long and hard about his decision to take the reins at BT, but there will be no quick-fix solutions to help the beleaguered former state telecoms firm out of its current crisis. If anything, the top job at BT is just another poisoned chalice. One City analyst said this morning that Sir Christopher was jumping from the frying pan into the fire. While Sir Christopher is a perfect choice for the job on paper, given his experience of dealing with regulators, red tape and bureaucracy at the BBC and the trucking company, NFC, the City was hoping for fresh blood - someone to drive things forward rather than get bogged down in stonewalling. A massive task awaits Sir Christopher. The telecoms company has a \u00a330bn debt mountain - equal to almost all of its \u00a335bn stock market valuation - and had hoped to repay some of its loans by selling off parts of its business and demerging others as separate listed companies. Last night it finally managed to divest its stake in internet access provider LineOne, but for all its years of funding only received \u00a36.2m in cash and \u00a324.9m in Tiscali shares from the sale of the business. This morning it emerged that BT was close to issuing a record-breaking \u00a35bn rights issues to shore up its finances. Shareholders would be offered the opportunity to buy new shares at a big discount. The rights issue was first mooted in March and BT has since been talking to fund managers to gauge City reaction. The feeling is that the City would support a cash call, but only if Sir Iain Vallance and Sir Peter Bonfield left the company. Gone are the days when BT was the stock market darling. Its value has tumbled by 61% in the past year, from \u00a315 a year ago to \u00a35.40 today. And, although hard to imagine, some commentators believe the company, which was once a utility just like water and gas companies, could disappear altogether unless radical steps are taken. Sir Iain, who is also chairman of the Confederation of British Industry, and Sir Peter are viewed as jointly responsible for the company's predicament, and today cries of scapegoat accompanied news of Sir Iain's departure. BT is no longer the global telecoms giant it once was. It is now regarded as little more than a bit part player on the world stage, and has been condemned from all quarters of industry for being a lumbering, archaic organisation. Rather than rapidly expanding into new markets and rolling out new technologies, BT has dragged its heels on key issues such as ADSL and is now dwarfed by European rivals it once considered its equals. While Vodafone has defiantly marched through world markets to become a genuine global force, BT has failed to create a global company - aborting mergers with the likes of Cable &amp; Wireless and the US company MCI. BT has also failed to fully exploit the internet and found itself sneered over by companies such as Freeserve, which have moved quicker and proved more imaginative with new services and pricing. The City fell out with BT last year, saying its management was spending too much time and energy trying to hold on to its old monopolies and fighting the telecoms regulator. The icing on the cake was when BT paid \u00a310bn more than it should have done to secure a 3G mobile telephone licence. Since then, the City has been baying for blood and demanding the resignations of both Sir Iain and Sir Peter. The latter is said to be clinging on with his teeth, awaiting reaction to Sir Iain's departure before making a decision on his own future with BT. What is certain today is that Sir Christopher won't have much of a honeymoon period when he arrives at BT next week.

      "bodyText": "Michael Winner has attacked departing film critic Barry Norman, who condemned the standard of modern Hollywood films when he announced his retirement this week. Writing in The Mirror, Winner - who directed the Death Wish trilogy - said the film industry is currently enjoying a golden age and he accused Norman of wallowing in hazy nostalgia. Outspoken Winner said actors like Russell Crowe could benefit and hone their talent by studying the work of Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro. Citing Brando as the best, he said the heavyweight star helped change on screen performance from formal, visible acting to charismatic characterisation. And he said the advances in the technical craft of film-making and in special effects are what helped make Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon \"so wondrous\". \"If films aren't as much fun, why are people going to them in ever increasing numbers?\" he said. \"Doubtless Mr Norman would retort that it's because we are of lower intellect and exhibit lesser expectations This is rubbish!\" Winner cited Bambi, Erin Brockovich, The Third Man, Gladiator and Lawrence of Arabia as his five film gems.",

Graham Watson, the Liberal Democrat chairman of the European parliament's citizens rights committee, called the vote a \"roaring rip in the veil of secrecy\". Calls for more freedom of information in Europe increased after the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty, itself seen as a peak of bureaucratic and diplomatic opacity. In 1995 John Carvel, then a Guardian correspondent in Brussels, backed by Denmark and the Netherlands, took the council of ministers to court for refusing access to documents that should have been available under its own rules, and won a knockout victory. Two years later the treaty of Amsterdam, signed by Tony Blair just weeks after taking office, called for the creation of a code of access to documents by this month - which yesterday's vote now makes possible. Freedom of information is a highly sensitive issue. The previous European commission, under Jacques Santer of Luxembourg, was discredited and forced to resign partly over issues of a lack of transparency. Romano Prodi, his Italian successor, has published a list of his correspondence on his website, though not the documents themselves. Britain has been praised for taking an open approach to the code, with diplomats arguing that transparency should increase the EU's popularity. This agreement overturns a controversial decision by Javier Solana, the council's foreign policy chief, to exclude whole categories of documents from public access. Mr Solana argued that Nato would be less willing to share its secrets with fledgling EU defence bodies if freedom of information procedures were too relaxed. Under the code, if a request for information is denied, the applicant may appeal to the ombudsman or the court of justice in Luxembourg. EU institutions can refuse to provide information but must be able to prove that release would be harmful.

WPP, which now derives around half its revenue from the US, said like-for-like revenues excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations rose 6% in the first three months of the year. The figure fell short of even WPP's own estimations of 7% growth, which the company had described as \"conservative\". But the headline figure in today's trading statement showed a 73% rise in revenue for the three months to March 31. This reflected first-time contributions from the US advertising giant, Young &amp; Rubicam, which WPP acquired last year, and the strength of the dollar and European currencies against the pound. WPP said it was on track to lift its operating margin by one percentage point to 15% in 2001. In a statement, the company said the economic slowdown had \"impacted public relations and public affairs, and branding and identity, healthcare and specialist communications the most, advertising and media investment management less so, and information and consultancy the least\".",

      "body": "<p>In what would be one of the more aberrant recent decisions of the French justice system, two pro-pot activists risk spending a year in jail for wearing T-shirts emblazoned with a picture of a cannabis leaf.</p> <p>A zealous public prosecutor this week demanded 12-month prison terms for Jean-Pierre Galland, president of the Cannabis Information and Research Collective, and Laurence Duffy, head of the campaign group's Lyon branch, for contravening article 630 of the French public health regulations.</p> <p>The law bans French citizens from \"portraying in a favourable light and promoting or inciting the consumption of any product classed as a banned substance\". The pair are also accused of selling CDs bearing the deeply suspect title of \"A little piece of hemp music\".</p> <p>This is, of course, an absurdity, something that was pointed out by some 40 people, including philosophers, Green MPs, actors, film-makers and representatives of human rights and Aids groups, who signed an open letter to the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, saying as much.</p> <p>Nor is it the first time that the collective, a nationwide association of committed weed smokers, has run into trouble. The brave Mr Galland has so far incurred fines totalling \u00a310,000 for his activities, the most memorable of which was probably to mail all 577 members of the French parliament a neatly rolled joint along with a letter demanding the relaxation of France's drugs laws, among the harshest in Europe.</p> <p>\"Nurtured and cosseted by enthusiasts, this cannabis, raised under the sweet skies of France, has been generously donated by growers to give to you,\" read the letter poetically. The MPs would now be in the same position as the many thousands of their fellow citizens who had illegally rolled and shared a joint, it continued: \"A law that is broken daily by hundreds of thousands of people is a bad law. It is time for the state to stop treating cannabis enthusiasts like delinquents.\"</p> <p>To be fair, over the past couple of years, Mr Jospin's Socialist-led government has begun edging round to the collective's point of view.

      "bodyText": "In what would be one of the more aberrant recent decisions of the French justice system, two pro-pot activists risk spending a year in jail for wearing T-shirts emblazoned with a picture of a cannabis leaf. A zealous public prosecutor this week demanded 12-month prison terms for Jean-Pierre Galland, president of the Cannabis Information and Research Collective, and Laurence Duffy, head of the campaign group's Lyon branch, for contravening article 630 of the French public health regulations. The law bans French citizens from \"portraying in a favourable light and promoting or inciting the consumption of any product classed as a banned substance\". The pair are also accused of selling CDs bearing the deeply suspect title of \"A little piece of hemp music\". This is, of course, an absurdity, something that was pointed out by some 40 people, including philosophers, Green MPs, actors, film-makers and representatives of human rights and Aids groups, who signed an open letter to the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, saying as much. Nor is it the first time that the collective, a nationwide association of committed weed smokers, has run into trouble. The brave Mr Galland has so far incurred fines totalling \u00a310,000 for his activities, the most memorable of which was probably to mail all 577 members of the French parliament a neatly rolled joint along with a letter demanding the relaxation of France's drugs laws, among the harshest in Europe. \"Nurtured and cosseted by enthusiasts, this cannabis, raised under the sweet skies of France, has been generously donated by growers to give to you,\" read the letter poetically. The MPs would now be in the same position as the many thousands of their fellow citizens who had illegally rolled and shared a joint, it continued: \"A law that is broken daily by hundreds of thousands of people is a bad law. It is time for the state to stop treating cannabis enthusiasts like delinquents.\" To be fair, over the past couple of years, Mr Jospin's Socialist-led government has begun edging round to the collective's point of view. Officially, the use, possession and sale of marijuana is still banned, despite estimates that some 7m of the country's 60m people have tried the drug at least once and about 2m are regular users. But after a number of high-profile admissions by ministers, France's traditionally draconian approach - which theoretically makes the import of few grammes of Dutch weed punishable by up to 30 years in prison - could no longer sensibly be maintained. The Green environment minister, Dominique Voynet, caused uproar among conservative MPs when she admitted having smoked cannabis and favouring decriminalisation. \"I am more worried by the number of French people who need sleeping pills than by the number of people who confess to having smoked a joint,\" she said. The Socialist employment (and formerly justice) minister, Elizabeth Guigou, has also expressed the opinion that smoking the occasional joint was \"no tragedy\" and the health minister Bernard Kouchner is known to support the medical use of cannabis on prescription. Even Mr Jospin, when pressed, will admit to having smoked some hashish in the past. The conservative opposition, headed by the president, Jacques Chirac, has always been hostile to any relaxation. Mr Chirac has repeatedly accused the Netherlands in particular of encouraging trafficking by tolerating soft drugs consumption. \"Consuming soft drugs inevitably leads to hard drugs,\" he said. \"All serious people are aware of this.\" Nonetheless, encouraged in part by similar moves in several other European countries, France's inter-ministerial drugs commission last year recommended a rather softer approach and the justice minister has written to all the country's judges urging them to avoid prison sentences for offences related to cannabis consumption. All of which, as the collective's supporters point out in their letter, makes the demand of the Lyon public prosecutor even more absurd. \"It means,\" they said in their letter to Mr Jospin, \"that in France, the birthplace of human rights, in the year 2001, you can no longer be jailed for consuming cannabis but you can be for 'portraying its consumption in a favourable light'.\" The PM has yet to reply, but the case poses a difficult problem for him: one of the main aims of recent judicial reforms in France was to remove any possibility of government interference with cases coming before the courts. Sadly, Mr Galland's fate is likely to hinge on whether or not the presiding magistrate ever rolled a spliff in his youth.

      "body": "<p>Clara Parker (not her real name) is horribly traumatised by a rape carried out last year by John Archibald at the Buckinghamshire nursing home where she is looked after. She is in the advanced stages of Huntington's disease, a condition that impairs mental and physical ability. Her husband Michael (not his real name), a BBC presenter, had to fight to persuade the crown prosecution service to take on the case but at Reading crown court on Friday, when Archibald was jailed for three years for the rape, Michael had little time to feel vindicated nor Clara to feel safe. Moments after the sentence was passed, Archibald's brother Mark turned to Michael, tried to hit him and said: \"I'll get you for this. I'll have you.\" </p> <p>The next day, a minibus was burnt out in an arson attack outside the home. There is no evidence that it's connected but police are investigating. </p> <p>Bringing to court any sort of rape case is fraught with difficulties and only around one in 10 of the rapes reported to police results in a prosecution. When the victim is especially vulnerable because of a mental or physical illness or a learning disability, the chances of getting a case to court slump even further. The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 contains new provisions to help vulnerable adults give evidence in court, such as judges removing wigs, the erection of screens between witnesses and defendants and video recordings used as evidence. These provisions were supposed to be in place by the end of last year but a Home Office spokesman admits implementation of most could be another year away. </p> <p>Progress has also been slow in the proposed reform of the Sex Offences Act which recommends strengthening the law in cases where a person in a position of trust or responsibility carries out abuse. The Department of Health has guidelines for local authorities to protect vulnerable adults who are abused, but there is no legal requirement to implement them. </p> <p>Tamsin Cottis of Respond, which provides counselling for people with learning difficulties who have been abused, says: \"Decisions can be taken very early on that women like Clara wouldn't make good witnesses. People like her are more vulnerable than others to abuse, yet when they are victims of sex crimes, it is much harder for them to get justice.\" </p> <p>The assumption that Clara would not be a good witness dogged Michael when he tried to get her rape brought to court. Though the crime was witnessed by a wheelchair-bound patient and there was DNA evidence, the CPS said Clara's evidence might not be \"reliable\" because she is a nursing home patient. </p> <p>Michael and Clara met in the early 60s when both worked as journalists on a local paper. They married in 1962 but problems began when Clara developed severe mood swings and obsessional behaviour in her late 40s. The couple separated in the late 80s and it wasn't until 1995 that Clara was diagnosed with Huntington's disease. Michael returned, saying he felt responsible for looking after her, and in January last year she moved into the Buckinghamshire nursing home. </p> <p>The rape took place when another resident invited Clara, a compulsive smoker, into his room for a cigarette. John Archibald, who was visiting a relative, and his brother Mark came too. Mark handed Clara two cannabis cigarettes. She had never tried the drug before and did not know it was in the cigarettes. After smoking them, she tried to return to her room but John Archibald forced her on to the bed and raped her twice. </p> <p>Clara says the attack is the worst thing that has ever happened to her. \"I felt so unclean and they hurt me so badly. My body took weeks to recover.\" </p> <p>The next morning staff told Michael what had happened and Clara was taken to a local rape centre where she was examined by a police doctor and video evidence was taken. However, the CPS decided not to prosecute and it took Michael four months to persuade them to change their minds. \"I believe she was singled out because she was vulnerable. I had to fight for her, she couldn't fight for herself. I kept insisting that it was their duty to pursue the case, that they had DNA evidence, a witness and my wife's testimony.\" </p> <p>The case finally came to court last November and the jury convicted John Archibald of the rape. Clara did not give evidence in court. </p> <p>Often the only course open to a victim if the CPS decides not to pursue the case is to take out a civil action, not against the perpetrator but, in a case like Clara's, against the nursing home for allowing visitors to be left alone with her without supervision. And victims are sometimes unable to communicate what has happened to them or are too terrified to talk. </p> <p>Christiana Horrocks, director of Voice, which provides support for adults and children with learning disabilities who have been abused, says: \"Sometimes the reasons given to victims to stop them talking are even more evil than the abuse. One young woman was raped by a man who knew her mother was in remission from cancer. He told her if she said anything about the attack, her mother would die from the cancer.\" </p> <p>Harriet Wistrich, a solicitor who advises women making complaints about the way their rape investigations have been handled, says women need to be \"perfect victims\" to avoid running into difficulties if the case goes to court. \"Saying a woman consented is often used by the defence,\" she points out. \"Even if there is evidence of serious bruises and other injuries, the defence may say: 'She just liked it rough.' There are so many rapes in children's and residential homes, and psychiatric institutions, because rapists know they can get away with it there.\" </p> <p>Janine (not her real name), a 26-year-old who had been receiving treatment for severe anorexia and a personality disorder, was at a low ebb when she met a man who was kind to her. She had walked out of a hospital psychiatric ward and had nowhere to go. He offered her a bed for the night at the hostel he was staying at. Once there, he trapped her in his bedroom and force-fed her cannabis and crack before raping her four times. The drug cocktail paralysed her for several hours and it was only when her attacker finally fell asleep that she managed to half walk, half fall out of his bedroom, collapsing in the hostel office. Her heart stopped but she was resuscitated and taken to hospital. </p> <p>\"I told the staff what had happened and they reported it to the police. But the officer who came to see me was so hard. He tried to get me to sign a form withdrawing the rape allegations but I refused. He said if I didn't sign, I would put my family through hell and that I already had a history of that because of my anorexia. He said if the CPS threw the case out, they could get me for wasting police time.\" </p> <p>Last December, two measures were introduced to protect alleged rape victims in court: restriction of admissible evidence about their sexual history and an end to cross-examination by the alleged rapist. But there is still a long way to go before all women, and particularly those who are most vulnerable, can get a fair hearing. As Janine says: \"People are hit at their lowest ebb and it's when you get to that point that you are least likely to get support from the criminal justice system.\"</p>",

Blue Dove refers to a fictional pottery owned by the family at the centre of the series. The drama is set in the Potteries region around Stoke on Trent. \"Blue Dove is a contemporary family saga, relating to a pottery family in the Potteries,\" said Nick Elliott, the ITV controller of drama. \"It's a big dynastic struggle with love affairs, business and back-stabbing, in the same genre as the Brothers. \"When the family patriarch hands over the pottery an internecine struggle breaks out between the siblings and others.\" The eight-part series has been written by Ms Gannon and is currently in production. The cast includes former EastEnders star Paul Nicholls and Ruth Gemmell, who played Colin Firth's long-suffering girlfriend in the film adaptation of Nick Hornby's book, Fever Pitch. Blue Dove is being made by Carlton Productions, with the controller of drama, Jonathan Powell, executive producing.",

Home Office figures also showed the backlog of cases waiting for a decision had fallen to 36,390 - down from more than 101,000 in February last year. The proportion of claimants recognised as refugees or given special leave to stay in Britain last month was 25%, with a further 16% refused on technical \"non-compliance\" grounds. </p> <p>Mr Straw said that 9,000 failed asylum seekers were deported in the past 12 months and others left voluntarily. He hoped the target of 30,000 removals over the next year would be met. Immigration officials admitted yesterday it was difficult to send failed asylum seekers back to countries such as Iraq as direct flights were not possible from British airports. </p> <p>Three new immigration arrest teams are to be set up by this autumn in London to track down those who have failed to leave the country. The teams, which have the power to arrest failed asylum seekers without police officers present, will also have access to 150 new mobile fingerprint scanners. Five new x-ray scanners are to be installed in Calais to detect people hiding in lorries. </p> <p>But it is the changes at a European level which are likely to have the greatest impact on the asylum system. Mr Straw acknowledged yesterday that some European countries operated narrower definitions of who qualified as a refugee than Britain. </p> <p>He said: \"There should be a level picture so we have similar definitions which apply across Europe. What I suspect is that under the EU directive we will have common standards. But I can't say whether ours will go up or down.\" </p> <p>Refugee groups and immigration lawyers fear Mr Straw will use the directive to exclude people the courts in Britain have ruled should be given asylum. An immigration lawyer, Nicholas Blake, said: \"He is seeking to change the nature of the UK's obligations by political action at the level of the EU to overturn judicial decisions. That is incompatible with the rule of law.\" </p> <p>Mr Blake said those most likely to be affected were the victims of non-state persecution such as spouses at risk of marital killings, and victims of organised criminal gangs. </p> <p>\u0095 Ferry operator P&amp;O said it had caught 1,600 illegal asylum seekers over the past three months since it had started making mechanised checks - using carbon dioxide detectors - at the start of the year in Calais.</p>",

Official Maff figures suggest 2.06m animals have been killed, with 178,000 awaiting slaughter, and the numbers falling every day. But this disguises the fact that more than 450,000 animals have already been slaughtered and 790,000 animals are still waiting to be killed under the intervention board's welfare scheme. The figures do not take into account 250,000 animals which have been killed under a separate voluntary scheme but are not included in the main statistics. Meanwhile, a group of more than 40 vets has written to the prime minister questioning the government's policy to cull all uninfected animals on contiguous farms. David King, the government's chief scientific adviser, and Roy Anderson, from Imperial College, are both criticised for their lack of veterinary expertise. The letter states: \"Neither of these men have any veterinary training... we are seeing a savage attack on what livestock remains in the north of England and south-west Scotland.\" The number of animals due to be killed, according to Maff, is already more than five times greater than in 1967 when 433,987 animals were slaughtered.

The only other foot and mouth epidemic which has reached these proportions is believed to be the 1997-2000 outbreak in Taiwan when up to 4m pigs were killed or died. New figures released by Maff also suggest that the daily average of animals disposed of in pits, rendered or burnt on pyres is actually declining despite a backlog of disposal cases. Provisional figures for the week ending April 22 state that 32,000 animals were killed and 37,000 disposed of, compared with 61,000 and 56,000 respectively for the previous week.

Paul Tiplady, chief executive of the park said: \"If we don't vaccinate in the next week it will be too late because the cattle are about to be brought out and once sheep and cattle mix, then vaccination will be impossible.\" Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up What's going on?

They want to believe that ministers will deliver public services better in future than they have done hitherto. They want more and better schools, more and better hospitals, more and better policemen, more and better trains that can be better relied on to arrive on time. How ministers set about this is, for many people, a matter of indifference. What they want are results. Quite obviously they have decided that Labour will get closer to achieving some results in the next four years than the Tories have any chance of doing.</p> <p>There's only one disadvantage to this programme. It sounds exceedingly boring. There's not a trace of glamour about it. The speeches it generates are of paralysing tedium. No whiff of danger disturbs the air, as the lists of claims and promises are trotted out. If there's a big idea here, perhaps still called the third way, it's so spacious that nobody can disagree with it. The politics of better public services creates few enemies. Even the Tory party, in this respect, is an inadequate enemy. It has chosen to mimic most Labour pledges, from more spending on health to increasing the minimum wage. So, on the issues people really care about, Mr Blair cannot rely on his opponents to generate the sparks that are absent from his own agenda.</p> <p>This is at odds, however, with Blairism's image. The style isn't right. It's the politics of the roundhead not the cavalier. Blairite propaganda has always placed wearisome emphasis on novelty and excitement. All that terrible garbage, in the early years, about this young country of ours. All the deforming drama of the spin. All the double-claiming for single achievements, clothing repetition in bogus originality. Deep in the character of Mr Blair is an aversion to the political sobriety which is now, in fact, by far the most convincing message he could communicate to the country.</p> <p>Thus, as the Labour election manifesto is poised before the presses, there's a fear that it lacks enough novelty. Policy wonks cast about for wheezes that will please the master's appetite for something different. Whatever they do or don't come up with, we can be sure the manifesto will be described as radical. \"Radical\", unlike \"liberal\", is a word that has retained its proximity to motherhood in new Labour's first term. It's the formulaic label every lefty, in fact just about every politician, wants to appropriate and define to suit himself. But it has been neutered. In the sense of meaning something alarmingly new, \"radical\", in the field of domestic social policy, is the last thing Labour needs to pretend it will be.</p> <p>In the services that matter, people have had enough of novelty. The time has come to make old novelty work, at last. This is the theme running through The Blair Effect, edited by Anthony Seldon and published by Little Brown (\u00a314.99), the indispensable new guide to what has happened so far, which shows what a long way there is to go before Britain becomes a much better country than it was four years ago. A thousand earnest quangos, ten thousand beavering committees, a million personal acts of service testify to Labour people's zealous reformist instincts. But many schools still turn out illiterates, and many hospitals continue to struggle against the tide of demand.</p> <p>The manifesto therefore doesn't need to include any great surprises. For the most part, it just needs to make the right pledges to do better, and see to some kind of completion what Labour began to do already. In this sense, it needs more of the roundhead instincts of Gordon Brown than the cavalier febrility of Tony Blair, whose own long-termism is too often overlaid by the passion for short-term effect that has been the most disappointing weakness of his first four years. Nobody understands better than Brown that if a political thing is worth saying once, it must axiomatically be said 20 times. That would never do for an artist, and is a habit even a political commentator must try to avoid. For a politician, on the other hand, unembarrassed repetition often seems the only effective way to din his message into the public mind.</p> <p>But the case against sudden originality, at this point in the Labour cycle, has another justification. It accords, I think, with the scepticism fair-minded voters retain about the possibilities of government and politics. The overriding demand is for mere competence, getting on and doing the intractable business that service delivery requires. Dull though they sound, therefore, some of the priorities flagged up for 2001-5 seem relevant to the moment. Reform of local government is one, the reshaping of Whitehall another. Not far behind is the sense that higher education is in urgent need of the reformer's hand. The fact that much of this is about structure and system, reliably the stuff of public narcolepsy, is a good sign not a bad one.</p> <p>The next term won't send everyone to sleep. There will be important zones of passion where my apologia for dullness will not apply. They will enliven the election campaign. The argument about ethnic, and historical, and geographical, and psychological Britishness looks set to have a long and rancid life, though one which the manifestos, as distinct from some of the people, will handle circumspectly. Europe will dominate our politics for the next four years, whatever happens to and in the referendum, and nobody can pre tend that's an arid argument.</p> <p>For the rest, though, I look to a considerable change of tone. Having crossed the river into a safe second term, Mr Blair should no longer feel so beholden to the demand for excitement. It's important not to lose momentum, but just as crucial to find a rhetoric that doesn't depend on reinventing bogus initiatives and claiming successes before they can be proved. The media, which have a large part in inventing a public thirst for novelty, will doubtless be the first to chide Blair for not supplying enough of it. I hope, in these engine rooms of state provision, that except for making good the multiple promises to spend a lot more money, he loftily ignores them. Going back to ground-zero for yet another rethink of primary healthcare is not the way to build credibility as a long-term reformer.</p> <p>Some people say the test of Labour's manifesto is whether it outlines a less \"cautious\" second term than the first. Others note that it's rare for second terms to be more truly radical than first terms, though, as Seldon notes in his conclusion, Margaret Thatcher and Franklin Roosevelt offer counter-cases. Except for Europe, it seems to me, caution is not the issue. The vision of 1997 was already incautious, nothing less than the transformation of public service. It hasn't happened.

There is now no one I know from either the libertarian or conservative wing of the party which is opposed to the sex and relationship guidance within schools.\"</p> <p>Asked why he was seen by some as an authoritarian, he replies: \"I don't go along with trends, I don't believe in gesture politics and my roots are in a working class community, and I hope will stay there.\"</p> <p>In an indication that he is not quite the social conservative people claim, he says his concerns over an equal age of consent for gays have been largely set aside by amendments to legislation protecting those who are in a vulnerable position from people in a position of trust, such as residential care. He also insists he is not opposed to a debate on migration pointing out that he has done much to modernise the work permit system to encourage legitimate immigration.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett is keen to ward off those who want to break up the Department of Education and Employment.</p> <p>\"The prime mInister will have to weigh up the pluses and minuses, but I hope in whatever he does he does not break the link between education, skills and employability.\"</p> <p>Despite the achievements of the New Deal, including 1m extra jobs and 74.7% of working age in work, he admits there are still huge challenges ahead.</p> <p>A hard core of unemployed - many of them on drugs, illiterate, on on incapacity benefit or lone parents - remain untouched by the New Deal.</p> <p>He accepts there are still serious pockets of skill shortages especially for graduates in the public sector.</p> <p>\"We are now in a very buoyant labour market and our biggest challenge is to end the inequality in employment based on ethnicity, geography and class background. It is holding us back. We have to get into work people who historically have multiple social problems.\"</p> <p>He cites as an example of new thinking a \u00a340m programme aimed at hard core drug takers on the dole. Benefit will be withdrawn if the invidual refuses to go on a drug treatment programme.</p> <p>\"We will find someone a treatment clinic in one month instead of 12 months, and we will help that person stick with it, that is an enabling state.\"</p> <p>He also praises the year-old employment action zones already securing twice as many job placements for the long term unemployed as trasitional schemes.</p> <p>\"Benefit is absolutely conditional and everyone is given a personal job account to help them with transport, a suit or training to get a job.\"</p> <p>But he admits the raw figures - 280,000 young people off the dole, 60,000 long term unemployed through the new deal and into a job and 100,000 lone parents into a job - disguise a big problem of hidden unemployment.</p> <p>\"In the 80s and early 90s there is no question that the government used incapacity benefit to get people off the job count and avoid social unrest. Ninety per cent of those who go on to incapacity benefit never work again.</p> <p>\"That is an astonishing statistic.

      "bodyText": "David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, is not normally a man for nostalgia, but on the eve of a widely expected promotion to the home secretaryship in a post-election reshuffle he is anxious to revisit his last four years to dispel the suggestion that he is an illiberal statist dragooning people into work. It is a reputation he feels he does not deserve, and he denies outright that he had ever confided that if given the home secretaryship, he would make Jack Straw look like a liberal. \"I have never said that and I do not believe it. \"I am a rational balanced politician who in practice as leader of Sheffield council for seven years, and then in government has always balanced the freedom and liberty of the individual against social good of a rational, balanced social policy. \"My work on sex guidance in schools was highly liberal and highly socially responsible. There is now no one I know from either the libertarian or conservative wing of the party which is opposed to the sex and relationship guidance within schools.\" Asked why he was seen by some as an authoritarian, he replies: \"I don't go along with trends, I don't believe in gesture politics and my roots are in a working class community, and I hope will stay there.\" In an indication that he is not quite the social conservative people claim, he says his concerns over an equal age of consent for gays have been largely set aside by amendments to legislation protecting those who are in a vulnerable position from people in a position of trust, such as residential care. He also insists he is not opposed to a debate on migration pointing out that he has done much to modernise the work permit system to encourage legitimate immigration. Mr Blunkett is keen to ward off those who want to break up the Department of Education and Employment. \"The prime mInister will have to weigh up the pluses and minuses, but I hope in whatever he does he does not break the link between education, skills and employability.\" Despite the achievements of the New Deal, including 1m extra jobs and 74.7% of working age in work, he admits there are still huge challenges ahead. A hard core of unemployed - many of them on drugs, illiterate, on on incapacity benefit or lone parents - remain untouched by the New Deal. He accepts there are still serious pockets of skill shortages especially for graduates in the public sector. \"We are now in a very buoyant labour market and our biggest challenge is to end the inequality in employment based on ethnicity, geography and class background. It is holding us back. We have to get into work people who historically have multiple social problems.\" He cites as an example of new thinking a \u00a340m programme aimed at hard core drug takers on the dole. Benefit will be withdrawn if the invidual refuses to go on a drug treatment programme. \"We will find someone a treatment clinic in one month instead of 12 months, and we will help that person stick with it, that is an enabling state.\" He also praises the year-old employment action zones already securing twice as many job placements for the long term unemployed as trasitional schemes. \"Benefit is absolutely conditional and everyone is given a personal job account to help them with transport, a suit or training to get a job.\" But he admits the raw figures - 280,000 young people off the dole, 60,000 long term unemployed through the new deal and into a job and 100,000 lone parents into a job - disguise a big problem of hidden unemployment. \"In the 80s and early 90s there is no question that the government used incapacity benefit to get people off the job count and avoid social unrest. Ninety per cent of those who go on to incapacity benefit never work again. \"That is an astonishing statistic. As a result of the use of IB in some areas it has made it very difficult to revive these local economies.\" He admits Labour has been unable to slow the trend with 150,000 a year going from being available to work onto incapacity a year. \"We have still have too many going on at too high a rate. I am one of those who believe there is much more to be done.\" Pilot schemes have started to try to check the flow. Mr Blunkett justifies the move: \"If you are employed and go sick, then it would be normal to follow through and make an effort to restore someone to health. \"You don't expect people to move out of work and straight into incapacity benefit for ever.\" However, he admits it may still be a long term agenda to start tackling the 2m pool of unemployed on incapacity benefit. People are very jumpy about the issue. Overall though he argues the supply side policies have transformed the relationship between employment and inflation. \"Traditional economic thinking would have said tight labour market pressure on inflation - therefore you cannot be optimistic about growth in the labour market. Well, that has not proved the case.\"",

The prince was spared the routine questioning at immigration control about whether he had been on a farm in the past fortnight or was carrying any sandwiches. Buckingham Palace had given prior assurances to authorities that the prince had not stepped off the Balmoral estate for the past two weeks and that it is remote from the nearest outbreak of the disease. A spokeswoman for St James's Palace assured the Canadian media: \"The prince accepts that the precautions are of the utmost importance and the clothes of all his party have been properly laundered, shoes disinfected and meat products have not been carried on board his aircraft. There have been no farm visits.\" Members of the royal entourage including valet, equerry, press officer and security staff were similarly disinfected on arrival. Canada, like the United States, has been shown a raft of pictures of burning cows in Britain in recent weeks, though the country's leading newspaper, the Globe and Mail, carried a reassuring headline in its sports section yesterday: \"Golfers shouldn't forgo trips to Britain.\" Its golf correspondent has apparently played all the top courses in the past 10 days without seeing a single charred corpse.

Mr Livingstone launched the Access IT! project yesterday at Friars primary school in Southwark, south London, with the three year aim of recycling 100,000 PCs from companies that are upgrading their equipment, and placing them in London schools at a 10th of a new computer's cost. \"Giving children the chance they need to develop computer skills will... benefit London as a whole,\" he said Organising the campaign is Tools for Schools, supported by the Guardian, which hopes to provide a PC for every classroom desk.

They want longer with their doctor. That's all to the good, but I book to spend 10 minutes with each patient and it often over-runs.\" </p> <p>Not only are more people turning up, but GPs are now being asked to go out and find them. One of the big shifts in healthcare policy taking place is towards prevention. Frameworks for the treatment of diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart disease and mental health require GPs to call in patients for checks and run special clinics, some of which used to be done by hospitals in the past. </p> <p>But the money that was earmarked for fighting coronary heart disease is going into coronary bypass grafts and chest pain clinics run by hospitals and not the extra nurses and drugs that GPs feel they need to carry out their part of the plan. </p> <p>People are being discharged from hospital earlier than they used to be, which is good, say GPs, but they need a higher level of care once they get home. GPs are supposed to be developing services for post-natal depression and protocols for the care of the elderly. There are audits to be done and the training of GP recruits. And now all patients are supposed to be seen by their GP within 48 hours, according to the National Plan. </p> <p>\"Not everybody who says they want to see a doctor needs to see a doctor,\" says Bob Button, a GP representative of the BMA in Wessex. \"If you have a wart on your toe, it doesn't matter when you see the doctor.\" He says the increasing workload, the paperwork and the lack of help has drastically eroded the morale of GPs. \"When I first qualified 40 years ago, I was resentful of the fact I had to retire at 70.

He succeeds Sir Iain Vallance, who is succumbing to mounting shareholder pressure and quitting after a 35-year-career at the company. It is hoped that Sir Christopher, who once headed up the National Freight Corporation, now known as Exel, will turn the company's fortunes around. Sir Christopher will replace Sir Iain on May 1, although the latter is to stay on as \"president emeritus\" until July 2002. The outgoing chairman will not take a seat on BT's board. Sir Iain, who has been chairman of BT for 12 years, has been criticised in recent months as the company's debt mounted and its stock price plummeted. But today he denied he was leaving under pressure. \"For some time now I have felt it right that I should stand down once we could find an able successor,\" he said. \"BT is an excellent company operating in a highly competitive sector,\" said Sir Christopher. \"I look forward to chairing the board through the next challenging and exciting period.\" Sir Christopher planned to remain in his BBC job until the broadcasting company found a new chairman, the BBC reported. His departure will be a blow to the BBC director-general, Greg Dyke. The pair had a close working relationship originally forged at London Weekend Television during the 1980s when Sir Christopher was chairman of the ITV company and Mr Dyke was managing director. Today Sir Christopher denied there would be any conflict of interest in continuing to be chairman of the BBC and BT. \"The independence of the BBC, its editorial independence, is sacrosanct,\" he said on Radio 4's Today programme. He told the BBC interviewer: \"If I have as little influence on stories about BT as I have had about the BBC I am very happy about that.\" Downing Street paid tribute to Sir Christopher's achievements as BBC chairman. A spokeswoman for No 10 said: \"Sir Christopher Bland has been a very fine chairman of the BBC and will no doubt make a huge contribution to BT when he takes over as chairman. \"The government was informed in advance and was pleased to hear he had agreed to stay on at the BBC until a successor has been found.\" Related articles 20.03.2001: How BT got the numbers wrong 17.03.2001: Ailing giant rings the changes to survive 12.03.2001: BTs chiefs face ax 06.02.2001: BT's master unbundler takes centre stage Useful links BT BBC",

The Virgin Mobile brand name is to be emblazoned on the shirts of the Warbury Town players in the newspaper's daily cartoon, Striker. The mobile phone network will sponsor the cartoon for a year beginning on Monday April 30. The sponsorship is being written in to the Striker storyline. Mr Branson had a cameo role in the cartoon himself this week, meeting Warbury's Town's chairman, Fat Eric, to talk about sponsoring the club. The deal will be signed in Saturday's edition and Mr Branson will continue to make occasional appearances in the cartoon. Virgin Mobile and the Sun are to promote the sponsorship by selling Warbury Town football kits, merchandise and Striker-branded mobile phones to the paper's readers. Text messaging competitions, such as \"Guess the football result\", will run later in the year. The deal is being approached like a real football club sponsorship, but as a spokesman for Virgin Mobile said, it is costing significantly less than Vodafone's \u00a330m sponsorship of Manchester United. He added that Striker attracts 3.9m readers.

Norwood says brand name magazines are not out of the game by a long shot. But unless editors get a perfect \"read\" on their \"woman\" - and in 2001 she is a hybrid, neither a feminist like her mother used to be or a home-maker like her grandmother - they may not survive the competition. </p> <p>\"It has taken me a good year to understand what young American women want,\" Norwood says. She revamped Mademoiselle to include more frank talk about sex - only to find that American women wanted her to take a softer line. \"What I learned on Cosmo was that British women are not afraid of sex.

      "bodyText": "Radio adverts are a turn-off for listeners and advertisers must insist on higher creative standards. This was the message delivered at a packed, high-powered conference for the industry, hosted in central London's Royal Lancaster Hotel by the Radio Advertising Bureau. MT Rainey, the co-chief executive of advertising agency Rainey Kelly Cambell Roalfe, told the 500 delegates from brands such as Sainsbury's and Colgate-Palmolive it was time the advertising medium \"tried harder, and more often, to create great advertising\" properly suited to radio. Ms Rainey said while Britain had excelled at television advertising: \"I don't think we have ever really consistently cracked it in radio advertising.\" She added that, while the Americans were worse at all other types of advertising: \"They are so much better at radio than we are.\" She said neither advertisers nor agencies viewed radio in the correct strategic light. During the conference, Ms Rainey noted the uniquely intimate characteristics of radio were not respected by the endless repetition of \"come and get it in your local high street while stocks last\" messages. Even major advertisers often commissioned only one or two versions of their radio adverts - despite the fact they would be repeated frequently - to the annoyance of listeners. Ms Rainey urged advertisers to try for six ot seven versions and to pride themselves on \"beautifully scripted\" work. Too much radio had been shaped by the music culture, she added. Katrina Lowes, head of broadcast communications for BT, described how BT had commissioned 42 versions of its advert promoting cheap local call zones. It had paid attention to the voiceovers to ensure the wrong regional accents did not alienate listeners. Ms Lowes also asked why radio adverts were not talked about in the pub the way television commercials were. She urged advertisers to insist on pre-planning meetings and to hire specialist radio producers and good actors to ensure the finished product was listened to with enjoyment. David Lethbridge, the co-founder of confetti.co.uk, the wedding website, said that by using Graham Norton - a well known but suprising choice - for its voiceovers, the site had received a massive boost in awareness and hits. Ms Rainey concluded by warning advertisers not to buy radio airtime for the frequency of slots: \"The biggest source fo annoyance among consumers in radio advertising is repetition. \"If the best TV and print campaigns have about two or three executions, a good radio campaign should have about five or six,\" she concluded.",

      "body": "<p>Phoenix, the calf adopted by the media after being discovered alive under a heap of 15 culled animals, will be allowed to live as part of a change in the culling policy to be announced today by Nick Brown, the agriculture minister.</p> <p>A relieved Downing Street - inundated by calls for Phoenix to be saved after its photograph appeared in newspapers and on TV news bulletins - announced that the calf will be saved.</p> <p>It is expected that Mr Brown will announce the relaxation of the automatic culling of all animals on farms neighbouring another farm with a confirmed foot and mouth outbreak. Government policy has been to slaughter all animals on contiguous farms within 48 hours. In future, animals on neighbouring farms will be slaughtered only after tests prove they have the disease.</p> <p>The new policy will be restricted to specific areas and follows signs that the culling policy has helped to reduce the number of new foot and mouth outbreaks. The policy had been designed to create a firebreak and prevent the spread of the disease, but was widely criticised as a needless slaughter of healthy animals.</p> <p>Phoenix, a 12-day-old calf, survived a foot and mouth cull at a Devon farm, after spending five days next to its dead mother. It was among a herd of 15 slaughtered cattle. The herd was later found to have been healthy.</p> <p>Maff said last night that there had been confirmed outbreaks of foot and mouth on 1,483 farms with another 3,000 contiguous farms having their animals slaughtered on suspicion. Downing Street said that there had been only four confirmed new cases in Devon between Friday and Sunday.</p> <p>The Conservatives last night called on the government to explain the scientific basis for revising the policy. Tim Yeo, the shadow agriculture minister, said: \"We understand public concern about the slaughter of healthy animals, but we believe at this stage no risk should be taken, and that farms which border those where foot and mouth has been confirmed are obviously at high risk of being infected themselves.</p> <p>\"A sudden change in policy will need to be fully explained if confidence in the industry and among the public about the government's determination to eradicate foot and mouth disease is to be maintained.\"</p> <p>Earlier, the regional director of the National Farmers' Union, Anthony Gibson, had claimed that plans to go ahead with the calf's slaughter \"make King Herod look like a humanitarian\". Some newspapers had been preparing campaigns to save Phoenix and back the farm owner, Fred Board, who was planning to defy Maff's plans to kill the animal.</p> <p>Mr Board said last night: \"I never thought the life of our little calf would go as far as Downing Street but the decision is fantastic and everybody here is very, very pleased.\"</p> <p>Vets have complained in a fresh letter to Downing Street about the slaughter policy. They have complained that the chief scientific officer, David King, is out of touch with the farming community and causing needless pain with his scorched earth policy.</p> <p>However, Mr Brown is likely to tell MPs in a Commons statement today that the limited relaxation of the culling policy is justified by the steady decline in outbreaks. He is expected to argue that the reduced pressure on vets means it is easier to turn around the results on tests on animals more quickly.</p> <p>Mr Brown and customs and excise may also announce new restrictions on the personal import of food.</p> <p>More than 2,600 farms were tonight due to be released from infected area restrictions which have prevented them moving their animals to slaughter.</p> <p>Since April 19, 9,267 farms have had the restrictions lifted.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,474590,00.html\">Explained: vaccination</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/0,6514,180991,00.html\">Explained: The risk to human health</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">Explained: Pigswill's contribution to foot and mouth</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471911,00.html\">Foot and mouth in Europe</a></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,475723,00.html\">20.04.2001: The jab of conscience</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> </p> <p><b>Related articles</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,477960,00.html\">25.04.01: Two more tested for foot and mouth in humans</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,477967,00.html\">25.04.01: US offer of test refused at start of outbreak</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,477950,00.html\">25.04.01: Army cannot cover for stike</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,477954,00.html\">25.04.01: Disease sees off TT races</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\">16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">28.03.2001: Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">29.03.2001: Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth\">Foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/\">Election 2001: foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

Now we have no Concorde and no bright young net darlings with stacks of venture capital to blow. The days of putting on your most alluring smile, hitting the networking parties and trying to pull a million pound investment are over. </p> <p>Toby Stone runs <a href=\"http://www.cityflatshare.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">cityflatshare.co.uk</a>, a website for people seeking and renting shared accommodation in London. He did the networking party-go-round, but arrived just too late to secure the big deal. He's slightly wistful: \"Networking had an air of the Oscars about it. The investors swanned around like Hollywood producers, while we were the starlets.\" </p> <p>Sally Meecham, a director of travel community website <a href=\"http://www.traveldonkey.com\" target=\"_new\">traveldonkey.com</a>, which launched just before the crash, was amazed by the speed with which the bubble burst: \"We were a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre and then the scum of the earth in the space of about three months,\" she says. She was advised by a broker in February last year to seek \u00a35 million as first round funding - by August she was sat in front of an investor asking for a fifth of that sum. He hadn't even bothered to look at their website before the meeting. </p> <p>Sally and Toby did secure some backing. Sally got a \u00a330,000 Small Business Loan from the DTI, while Toby turned to family members and his bank manager. But both are starting to feel the pinch now. </p> <p>Abandoning the networking scene, and approaching private investors directly secured \u00a3127,000 for Andr\u00e9 Edmunds and his two co-directors at <a href=\"http://www.easy-jobs.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">easy-jobs.co.uk</a> - a recruitment website. \"We started looking for funding at exactly the same time as the crash. We managed to attract backing from 16 private investors, ranging from the chief executive of a blue chip, to retired professionals and a student.\" </p> <p>The reality of the post- bubble world for all three entrepreneurs is that finding further funds is extremely tough, even though all have businesses that are up and running and on the verge of generating some money. Toby, Sally and Andr\u00e9 are not for quitting though - they are finding alternative ways to make their businesses succeed. But it is hard work. </p> <p>Finding it increasingly difficult to assess risk in new media investments, investors are running shy of the internet networking scene, and many have taken refuge in angel networks. These investment organisations vet entrepreneurs' business plans before passing them onto the investors - for a fee. Toby and Andr\u00e9 have both tried them but are unimpressed: </p> <p>\"These agents charge \u00a3100 to \u00a3500 to look for investment. They're simply sharks, taking money without any guarantee of results,\" explains Andr\u00e9. \"They still want to take a percentage of the funds raised if they secure a deal.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere, the government remains keen to help internet entrepreneurs, but while Sally and the traveldonkey team managed to get their DTI loan a year ago, she knows from others that attempts to get one now are often impossible if you are a dot.com business </p> <p>\"The government is rather a waste of space,\" says Andr\u00e9. \"They have virtually the same requirements for their DTI Small Firm Loan as the venture capital firms have - not taking the risk until there is no risk.\" </p> <p>Toby feels the government has forgotten the entrepreneurs themselves. \"There are plenty of committees with businessmen, bankers, professors and accountants on them, but they forget to ask the grassroots entrepreneur what's happening on the ground. They are setting up organisations to help us get funding, but these only seem to create more barriers between us and the investors.\" </p> <p>There is a limit to the time and effort anyone is prepared to put into knocking on doors and re-writing business plans. All three have concluded that it is pointless chasing big investment money for now: \"Eventually,\" Sally says, \"we said 'Sod it, let's be poor, put our heads down and create the best travel review product on the internet'.\" </p> <p>Andr\u00e9 agrees: \"We have decided to concentrate on building a foundation of loyal business, funding ourselves from our own revenue. We are wasting our time trying to chase after the investment.\" </p> <p> So for now it's a case of hang up the glad-rags, roll up your sleeves and get on with proving your big idea really works - developing and validating the business, potentially on a smaller scale than you'd previously intended. This is fine in principle, but there is still the problem of paying the mortgage and putting food on the table. Andr\u00e9 has sold everything except his house, including his beloved Lotus Esprit. Toby's car is also on the market. All three are credit card jugglers, buying the groceries on the Selfridges storecard, running out of cash to buy the milk. Personal debts in the region of \u00a350,000 are not unusual. </p> <p>Toby has started giving private English lessons to get some quick cash, while Andr\u00e9 does short stints as a senior project manager. But this is not to admit defeat - it is being flexible. </p> <p>Indeed their experiences suggest that the true test of an entrepreneur's mettle comes after they've had the big idea. Long term success will come from short-term flexibility, harnessing creativity to find ways to solve the problems of funding. </p> <p>The easy-jobs team had a spark of extra originality in the business plan development phase: \"The twist was that we were not giving away any equity. The investors receive a share of the actual revenue - not profit - according to how much they invested for a period of three years. This is a unique investment model,\" explains Andr\u00e9. </p> <p>For Sally and the traveldonkey team, the breakthrough has been strategic alliances. \"In the past month our company has made an extremely important turn,\" she explains. \"We now supply our content and community tools, white labelled, to other sites and portals. We've signed up seven partners including Lycos, Excite and Lineone. We will be producing our first invoices in about three weeks time.\" </p> <p>In the absence of financial backing, Toby has remodelled his business plan, charging users to search the site much earlier than planned and using reciprocal banner advertising arrangements with other websites to help generate traffic. </p> <p>Working with others in the internet community is an increasing theme for all three entrepreneurs. Gone are the days when you did not mention your website's name, or the idea behind your business, for fear that someone would steal it. </p> <p>\"The way the investor world worked fragmented the entrepreneurs and set them against each other quite unnecessarily,\" says Toby. \"Everyone appreciates the chance to share their experiences with the only other people who really understand.\" Sally and Andr\u00e9 share this view. It is encouraging to know others are going through similar hardship - and deriving advantage from their knowledge and experience is immensely valuable. </p> <p>Toby runs a forum to encourage sharing ideas and experience. The desire is to involve DTI-backed matchmaking initiatives as well, and to get entrepreneurs and investors working together towards the common goal of creating successful businesses. </p> <p>Both Sally and Andr\u00e9 see the value in collaboration: \"It would put the 'professional' back with the word 'entrepreneur', something which has been lost in all the hype and crash,\" comments Andr\u00e9. </p> <p>For now, all three businesses are growing. By applying fresh creativity and knuckling down for the long run, today's more wise and wary internet entrepreneurs are shaping up to a future that they believe will be rosy, despite predictions of gloom. </p> <p>\"Investors need companies to invest in,\" says Andr\u00e9. \"The rules need to change and entrepreneurs need to show investors that there are alternative ways of raising money, and that a good idea will succeed. If the investor decides not to invest, tough!\" </p> <p>All three are coming to the point which has been the crunch for many dot.coms - generating revenue. International expansion is on the cards. That is if the cards they currently rely on for their milk and mortgage payments don't get trumped in the next few months. </p> <p>\u0095 The internet entrepreneurs' forum can be found at <a href=\"http://www.wave2.org\">www.wave2.org</a></p>",

For Sally and the traveldonkey team, the breakthrough has been strategic alliances. \"In the past month our company has made an extremely important turn,\" she explains. \"We now supply our content and community tools, white labelled, to other sites and portals. We've signed up seven partners including Lycos, Excite and Lineone. We will be producing our first invoices in about three weeks time.\" In the absence of financial backing, Toby has remodelled his business plan, charging users to search the site much earlier than planned and using reciprocal banner advertising arrangements with other websites to help generate traffic. Working with others in the internet community is an increasing theme for all three entrepreneurs. Gone are the days when you did not mention your website's name, or the idea behind your business, for fear that someone would steal it. \"The way the investor world worked fragmented the entrepreneurs and set them against each other quite unnecessarily,\" says Toby. \"Everyone appreciates the chance to share their experiences with the only other people who really understand.\" Sally and Andr\u00e9 share this view. It is encouraging to know others are going through similar hardship - and deriving advantage from their knowledge and experience is immensely valuable. Toby runs a forum to encourage sharing ideas and experience. The desire is to involve DTI-backed matchmaking initiatives as well, and to get entrepreneurs and investors working together towards the common goal of creating successful businesses. Both Sally and Andr\u00e9 see the value in collaboration: \"It would put the 'professional' back with the word 'entrepreneur', something which has been lost in all the hype and crash,\" comments Andr\u00e9. For now, all three businesses are growing. By applying fresh creativity and knuckling down for the long run, today's more wise and wary internet entrepreneurs are shaping up to a future that they believe will be rosy, despite predictions of gloom. \"Investors need companies to invest in,\" says Andr\u00e9. \"The rules need to change and entrepreneurs need to show investors that there are alternative ways of raising money, and that a good idea will succeed. If the investor decides not to invest, tough!\" All three are coming to the point which has been the crunch for many dot.coms - generating revenue. International expansion is on the cards. That is if the cards they currently rely on for their milk and mortgage payments don't get trumped in the next few months. \u0095 The internet entrepreneurs' forum can be found at www.wave2.org",

      "bodyText": "Another chapter in the First Tuesday story came to an end yesterday when the first stock market listed company born out of the networking group was saved from closure by a multi-millionaire computer games entrepreneur. Kazoo3D, which was founded by a group of software developers who met at a First Tuesday event in late 1999, has agreed a reverse takeover by digital media developer ZOO Media Corporation for \u00a36.8m in shares. ZOO is majority owned by Ian Stewart, the founder of computer games firm Gremlin which was sold to French rival Infogrames for \u00a325m in May 1999. He will become chief executive of the enlarged group with ZOO chairman John Barnes, the former boss of fish and chip chain Harry Ramsden's, becoming non-executive chairman. Mr Stewart said that combining the two Sheffield-based companies would make the most of their assets and opportunities in the digital market place. Kazoo specialises in three-dimensional graphics while ZOO technology is designed to help online marketing campaigns and promotions. Kazoo raised \u00a310m when it floated on Aim in April last year with a valuation of \u00a352m. Its technology did not sell as well as hoped and in January it instigated a strategic review. In the year ended December 2000, Kazoo generated no revenues and made a pre-tax loss of \u00a34.6m. ZOO reported an operating loss of \u00a3373,000 on turnover of \u00a3536,000 in the six months to February 28. Shares in Kazoo fell 14% to 7.5p before being suspended at the company's request until the deal is closed. Kazoo's declining fortunes mirror those of First Tuesday, which has been bought back by its members for \u00a31m from the stricken Israeli firm that paid \u00a333m for it in the summer. The cocktail party-cum-fundraising meeting has declined in popularity as the technology market has taken a downturn with the number of budding entrepreneurs prepared to leave their salaried jobs diminishing by the day.",

BNOC was later dismantled by the Tories.</p> <p>The executive who spurned the approach to become chairman said: \"Railtrack is like Watergate. The more you investigate, the more you uncover and the worse it gets.\"</p> <p>Fears about increasing government control of the group have been heightened by the pending appointment to the board of a public interest director, a person representing passenger views.</p> <p>That appointment, according to Railtrack insiders, is likely to be made in time for the July annual general meeting. Railtrack will make the choice but will be \"guided\" by Mr Prescott and his team.</p> <p>An added concern is the possibility of being associated with corporate manslaughter charges after last October's Hatfield crash, even though the crown prosecution service may be unable to bring such charges.</p> <p>Sir John Parker, chairman of Lattice group, part of the old British Gas empire, ended his interest in the chairmanship on grounds of his wife's ill-health. Others said to have been in the frame include Sir Malcolm Field, outgoing chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority. \"New people have become available since we drew up our shortlist,\" Railtrack sources said.</p> <p>Yesterday Railtrack appointed David Harding, formerly of Rugby group, the building materials business, as finance director. He replaces acting finance director Sebastian Bull, who becomes a business development director. David Jones, former chief executive of National Grid, is to become a non-executive director.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Railtrack has been forced to look overseas for a new chairman because UK business executives approached by its headhunters keep turning down the job they see as a \"poisoned chalice\". This emerged yesterday as the group won back some credibility in the City after its post-Hatfield traumas by appointing three new directors to its board. But fears of creeping renationalisation and potential corporate manslaughter charges are proving hard to overcome. The search for a chairman to replace Sir Philip Beck has, insiders say, been severely hindered by uncertainties over government plans for Railtrack after the election. One non-rail senior executive said he and others had been deterred because it seemed as if John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, and Sir Alastair Morton, the strategic rail authority chairman, favoured a \"BNOC solution.\" The Labour government under Harold Wilson took a 51% controlling stake in the new British National Oil Corpora tion to enable the state to benefit from exploring and producing the rich oil reserves in the North Sea. BNOC was later dismantled by the Tories. The executive who spurned the approach to become chairman said: \"Railtrack is like Watergate. The more you investigate, the more you uncover and the worse it gets.\" Fears about increasing government control of the group have been heightened by the pending appointment to the board of a public interest director, a person representing passenger views. That appointment, according to Railtrack insiders, is likely to be made in time for the July annual general meeting. Railtrack will make the choice but will be \"guided\" by Mr Prescott and his team. An added concern is the possibility of being associated with corporate manslaughter charges after last October's Hatfield crash, even though the crown prosecution service may be unable to bring such charges. Sir John Parker, chairman of Lattice group, part of the old British Gas empire, ended his interest in the chairmanship on grounds of his wife's ill-health. Others said to have been in the frame include Sir Malcolm Field, outgoing chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority. \"New people have become available since we drew up our shortlist,\" Railtrack sources said. Yesterday Railtrack appointed David Harding, formerly of Rugby group, the building materials business, as finance director. He replaces acting finance director Sebastian Bull, who becomes a business development director. David Jones, former chief executive of National Grid, is to become a non-executive director.",

But all are hopelessly flimsy. The only reason Watson thinks the man on the station is Moriarty is because Holmes suggests it. The explanation for the second set of footprints is staring Watson in the face: as he himself records, Holmes persuaded the lad who brought the hoax letter to guide him up to the Falls.

      "body": "<p>Today's European Central Bank meeting should not be a difficult one. Never mind what is happening to business confidence in Germany; inflation is ticking up both there and in Italy. For the ECB to cut interest rates would damage its credibility. </p> <p>The difficulties will start if, as expected, the ECB keeps rates on hold. Most - though not all - of Europe's finance ministers appear to have grasped the idea that trying to push the bank into cutting rates can only lead to a perception of divided councils which in turn unsettles the euro. They have settled for saying as little as possible. </p> <p>Not so outside euroland. The US, in the person of Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill, and the International Monetary Fund's Horst K\u00f6hler are pressing for an ECB cut. Even Gordon Brown, the chancellor, has added his mite. </p> <p>The Bush administration's desire to see someone else take on a share of the burden of keeping global growth going is understandable but its approach smacks of the heavy handed.

Never mind what is happening to business confidence in Germany; inflation is ticking up both there and in Italy. For the ECB to cut interest rates would damage its credibility. The difficulties will start if, as expected, the ECB keeps rates on hold. Most - though not all - of Europe's finance ministers appear to have grasped the idea that trying to push the bank into cutting rates can only lead to a perception of divided councils which in turn unsettles the euro. They have settled for saying as little as possible. Not so outside euroland. The US, in the person of Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill, and the International Monetary Fund's Horst K\u00f6hler are pressing for an ECB cut. Even Gordon Brown, the chancellor, has added his mite. The Bush administration's desire to see someone else take on a share of the burden of keeping global growth going is understandable but its approach smacks of the heavy handed.

He is clearly used to people being nervous in his presence, and while he exudes a statesmanlike dignity he also has a magisterial ability to put us at ease. \"The young lady is reluctant to shake my hand,\" he teases gently when my turn comes to say goodbye. </p> <p>We are on the steps of Mandela's Johannesburg residence with Nitin Sawhney, who has just recorded an interview with Mandela for use on his forthcoming album, Prophesy. It is the culmination of an extraordinary week in South Africa in which we have been welcomed by a children's choir, come within inches of being shot in downtown Soweto, seen the sun rise across the plains of Africa - and now met Nelson Mandela. </p> <p>As the title of Sawhney's album suggests, Prophesy is about visions of the future. And although Mandela has in the past been wary of taking on the prophet's mantle - \"I stand before you not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you, the people,\" he said on his release from prison in 1990 - Sawhney is here to ask him what he foresees not only for South Africa but for the world. Mandela tells Sawhney: \"There are talented and good people, men and women throughout the world with vision and compassion, who realise that without lasting peace there can be no development. And therefore I am optimistic.\" </p> <p>The idea of development is one that is also central to Prophesy. With the album Sawhney wants to challenge the west's definition of the developing world and highlight the contrast between the spiritual impoverishment of the materially rich west and the comparative spiritual wealth of the supposedly undeveloped world. </p> <p>The first stop on our Johannesburg trip is the Rishile School in Soweto's Zone Four. Rishile is known for its school choir and Sawhney has written a song for the children to sing. As we wander across the school's leafy courtyard, past rooms full of small children smiling and waving excitedly at us, we begin to hear the soaring voices of the Rishile choir singing to us in Zulu. By the time we reach their classroom, their animated sound has filled the room and it is impossible not to be moved by the joy on the children's faces. As they sing, lining two sides of the room in their immaculate school uniforms, Sawhney sits down and starts to play along on his guitar. </p> <p>\"The feeling of hope is really strong in South Africa and that's something I noticed last time I was here,\" Sawhney tells me later. \"I was really taken by the amazing optimism that came from the children in the face of oppression and poverty. You see it in the incredible yelps of delight when they see their faces in the camera. It made me think, 'My God, what the hell have we lost in the west?' So I felt that was really appropriate to put on the album.\" </p> <p>For Sawhney, the trip to South Africa is the final lap of a global journey in which he has recorded with Aborigines in Australia, street sellers and tabla players in Bombay, and philosophising taxi drivers and blues singers in Chicago. There have also been Native American Indians on US reservations, Algerian rai singers in Paris and street children in Brazil - not to mention the English Chamber Orchestra and the London Community Gospel Choir in Britain. </p> <p>The link between them can be found in Sawhney's ideas of the future and his musical vision. Each country he visited has had some influence on him musically and each one also provided another outlook on the future. Yet, in contrast to so much that has come out of the vogue for the appropriation of eastern musical styles, Sawhney means it. As a result, he is almost bemused by the celebrity glamour he has recently gained. His 1999 album, Beyond Skin, was nominated for last year's Mer cury prize, and since then Sawhney has been name-checked by Madonna: apparently she does yoga to the album. Before that he had collaborated with Paul McCartney, Sinead O'Connor, Sting and Jeff Beck, and even before that he was part of the original team behind the hit BBC TV comedy Goodness Gracious Me. </p> <p>From the outset, Sawhney's work has centred on issues of cultural and racial identity and explored his own musical heritage as a British Asian. It is an approach that can easily be traced back to his childhood. As one of the few non-white pupils at his Kent grammar school in the 1970s, he was attacked frequently and violently by the then burgeoning National Front. His reaction was to go home and improvise on the piano. By the age of 11 he had reached grade eight, and although he excelled academically, everything else he did was merely a way of passing the time between playing the piano or picking up a guitar. Now, at 36, he says he has come to terms with many of the issues surrounding his identity and recognises that the injustices of the world go further than the facts of his own life. </p> <p>Sawhney's global journey has been filmed for a forthcoming DVD in which the album's title track, Prophesy, is played at different locations at sunrise. Pilanesberg National Park in South Africa is 140,000 acres of open plains, wooded valleys and dense bush, complete with roaming lions, giraffes, elephants, zebras and rhinos, and is therefore the perfect choice. So at 3.30am we drive through the night to a mountain-top viewpoint. The valleys and plains below us seem inexpressibly infinite and you can almost smell the stillness in the air. But, as Sawhney begins to play his guitar, instead of being invasive, the sound seems eerily in harmony with the transformation happening around us. As his music gains pace the sun's orange glow gradually begins to warm the earth and somehow it feels like a genuine awakening. </p> <p>Back in Johannesburg, our final stop is a return to Rishile to present the school with a synthesiser keyboard and CD sound system. Sawhney is aware that by recording the children he is laying himself open to accusations of exploitation, so in each country he has visited he has made a point of giving something back to the people he has recorded, either by means of a financial donation or an appropriate gift. \"It's a very viable accusation and it's something I think about a lot. But I can't see any other way of trying to depict the imbalances of the world from a personal viewpoint unless you do actually go to places and do something like recording a choir in a school in Soweto.\" </p> <p>As we arrive we are amazed to find the entire school waiting for us, seated assembly-style in the school courtyard. Once again, they begin to sing and, once again, it is breathtaking. After welcoming us, they unwrap their gifts. The children shriek with delight and the teachers dance around in a joyous circle of celebration. Later, when their head teacher thanks us in private, her voice shakes with emotion as she tells us that most of these teachers grew up without shoes and that for a black school in Soweto to have a piano of this kind is beyond anything they could ever have dreamed of. \"It's a miracle,\" says teacher Jane Kubayi. \"Our prayers have been answered and our dreams have been met.\" </p> <p>With Prophesy, Sawhney is giving his audience the chance to become passengers on his voyage of discovery. It is a journey that raises as many questions as it answers, through a combination of lush Brazilian strings juxtaposed with, yearning laments, Indian flutes with drum and bass, speech, news and hard rap with rousing blues, and aching ballads with barbed lyrics. </p> <p>But, I wonder, how much of Sawhney's intrinsic message will be fully digested? Does he really believe music can make a difference? \"Music is a universal language,\" he says, \"so it has no barriers. It's also an abstract form of expression that taps into people's subconscious, and that means it affects them much more deeply. So yes, I believe it can.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Prophesy is out on V2 Music on June 4. The South Africa Freedom Day concert in aid of Nelson Mandela's Children's Fund takes place in Trafalgar Square, London on Monday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Australian lapdancers, strippers and topless waitresses are forming a trade union to fight for better pay, related to the amount of flesh put on display and the length of the performance they give. Mystical Melody, spokeswoman for Striptease Artists Australia said she and other erotic dancers decided to set up their own union because \"so far no other organisation wishes to associate with the nature of the striptease industry\". Once it was registered with and recognised by the Industrial Relations Commission, she said, she hoped the union would help provide better professional development for the thousands of erotic performers who work in bars, clubs and pubs throughout Australia. Prostitution and \"adult entertainment\" - unknown to the Aboriginals - arrived in Australia with the first convict ships from England in 1788. The shortage of women -a ratio of one to six men until the 1820s - helped stimulate an industry which has continued to flourish despite draconian laws in some states. In Western Australia, prostitution remains illegal. The state authorities also outlaw the practice of throwing money at barmaids to encourage them to strip, a tradition which developed in pubs in the Kalgoorlie goldfields.",

It also brought the allegation that it amounted to wasting police time. The Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents 26,000 officers in London, said the inquiry was \"posture politics of the worst kind\". The police are investigating the possibility of bringing charges against President Saddam and Mr Aziz for alleged war crimes in connection with the taking of hostages, including Britons, in the run-up to the Gulf war. Human rights campaigners and lawyers protested yesterday against a ruling by the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, that offers the Iraqi president virtual immunity. They said his view that heads of state were immune from prosecution was outdated. Geoffrey Bindman, the human rights lawyer who represented Amnesty International in the Pinochet case, said the world had changed and such immunity no longer applied in cases of torture and other crimes against humanity. Indict, a London organisation set up to try to bring Iraqi leaders to trial for war crimes, which has received $1.5m from the US Congress, passed a dossier to Lord Williams in September urging prosecution of President Saddam and Mr Aziz. Lord Williams passed it on to Scotland Yard at the end of March. When they have read it they will have to decide, in consultation with Lord Williams and the crown prosecution service, whether to investigate further. A Met spokeswoman said: \"The attorney-general thinks it is worth pursuing: we are.\" She added: \"There is still a long way to go.\" But the chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, Glen Smyth, said: \"The man is a dictator and until he is toppled nothing will happen - when he is toppled his own people will take such retribution that will render anything we do in this country as useless.\" A police source, asked whether the investigation was just a paper exercise unlikely to lead to an indictment, was non-committal. But the source pointed to a statement from Lord Williams's office saying that there was no realistic prospect of convicting President Saddam, because he was \"entitled to assert immunity from criminal prosecution\". Human rights campaigners said that Lord Williams ducked the issue of immunity because it is a can of worms. The worry is that other leaders could face indictment: Vladimir Putin for Russian action in Chechnya, Jiang Zemin for China's in Tibet, Ariel Sharon for the West Bank and Gaza, and Tony Blair for Serbia and Iraq. But Indict has received legal advice that heads of state no longer enjoy immunity for crimes against humanity. \"We have to grasp the nettle,\" one of its legal team said. Mr Bindman said: \"The traditional view is that the current heads of state are immune from policies in any circumstances in English courts. \"But there are indications from some of the opinions of the Lords in the Pinochet case that this may not apply to proceedings from torture. Other trends in international human rights law show the position may have changed in relation to torture and other crimes against humanity.\" The international criminal court, in the process of being set up, will not recognise the immunity of heads of state. Ann Clwyd, the Labour MP who heads Indict and was seared by her travels among the Kurdish victims of the Iraqi government, said that yesterday's publicity had prompted more hostages to contact Indict. She said: \"It is pretty obvious that Saddam can claim immunity, but I do not believe British courts would uphold such a claim.

At worst children were still seen as an exploitable commodity and at best as tabulae rasae to be shaped and bullied into the formality of their parents. And if affection and tenderness were thin on the ground in child/parent relation ships, then the atmosphere turned positively glacial where grandparents were concerned.</p> <p>At least that's the archetypal image. But there were exceptions, and a notable one, that of Sir Henry Thornhill, has been given a new lease of life by his great-grandson and great-great grandsons on a website, <a href=\"http://www.ultimategrandparent.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Ultimate Grandparent</a>, which they hope will both entertain and encourage other grandparents to re-evaluate the way they relate to their grandchildren.</p> <p>Sir Henry Thornhill was the quintessential upperclass Victorian colonialist to the last inch of his 6ft 8ins physique. He was born in Agra, India in 1854, but was sent back to England to be educated at Eton. Later he joined the Indian army, where he collected various medals and rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, before retiring from active service and becoming a military magistrate for the Anderman Is lands and the North West Provinces of India. Having turned down a knighthood some years earlier on the grounds that \"it would do little more than add 10% to my bills\", he relented in 1911 and became a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire.</p> <p>Sir Henry had three children, Cudbert, Charles and Madge. In 1912 his first grandchild, Teddy, was born. The nearest that Teddy could get to the word grandpa when he was little was \"kaka\"; and so Kaka was born.

My father thought they might be from my mother's grandfather and suggested I check with uncle Teddy.

      "bodyText": "In any list of the Victorians' many achievements - the industrial revolution and colonising other people's countries, to name but two - bringing up children would feature somewhere near the bottom. At worst children were still seen as an exploitable commodity and at best as tabulae rasae to be shaped and bullied into the formality of their parents. And if affection and tenderness were thin on the ground in child/parent relation ships, then the atmosphere turned positively glacial where grandparents were concerned. At least that's the archetypal image. But there were exceptions, and a notable one, that of Sir Henry Thornhill, has been given a new lease of life by his great-grandson and great-great grandsons on a website, Ultimate Grandparent, which they hope will both entertain and encourage other grandparents to re-evaluate the way they relate to their grandchildren. Sir Henry Thornhill was the quintessential upperclass Victorian colonialist to the last inch of his 6ft 8ins physique. He was born in Agra, India in 1854, but was sent back to England to be educated at Eton. Later he joined the Indian army, where he collected various medals and rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, before retiring from active service and becoming a military magistrate for the Anderman Is lands and the North West Provinces of India. Having turned down a knighthood some years earlier on the grounds that \"it would do little more than add 10% to my bills\", he relented in 1911 and became a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire. Sir Henry had three children, Cudbert, Charles and Madge. In 1912 his first grandchild, Teddy, was born. The nearest that Teddy could get to the word grandpa when he was little was \"kaka\"; and so Kaka was born. Although Kaka had moved back to England, his grandchild was still in India, and he took to sending Teddy a fortnightly postcard which included a story and carefully drawn illustrations. Over the next nine years, Teddy acquired three sisters, Margaret, Elizabeth and Anne, and they too joined Kaka's fortnightly mailing list.

My father thought they might be from my mother's grandfather and suggested I check with uncle Teddy. He produced two albums of his own, and calls to my cousins rounded up four further albums from my aunts, Elizabeth and Anne.

All winter we fretted, convinced she'd been eaten, then one day in late April, out she staggered, alive and well.</p> <p>She's now 20 years old and every winter, we just let her put herself to sleep. We don't feed or water her. In fact she needs no care or attention. Ah, if only children were like that - we might have gone on to have had dozens.</p> <p>She woke up yesterday, bang on time as ever, but this spring she got a bit of a surprise. There to greet her with me was Amelia - my granddaughter, now nearly two, daughter of Jake.</p> <p>Amelia was a bit too young last year to enjoy the full pleasure of Tortee, but now she loves her.

      "body": "<p>It takes an uncommon kind of personality to spend the winter at the Amundsen-Scott research station at the geographic south pole, a blue dome and a scattering of warehouses huddled around a runway scooped out of the ice, dwarfed amid the 5.4 million square miles of Antarctica. In March, when the days draw in and the 200-strong summer teams of US Navy scientists head home, the station is left to a tiny community of 40 or 50 support staff to endure six months of unbroken darkness and some of the most hostile weather on earth. Their navy colleagues call them the Winteroverers.</p> <p>Captain Scott's diary entry on reaching the pole in 1912 - \"Great God, this is an awful place!\" - holds true today, and never more so than in winter, when summer highs of -18C plummet to -62C and below. The Winteroverers are trapped: even if the driving snow and rain were to relent enough to let an aeroplane land, the bitter cold would thicken its fuel to a useless sludge; wingflaps and propellors would cease to operate.</p> <p>Routine struggles to assert itself against remoteness - there is a gym and a snooker hall, a TV room with a stack of films on video - but it is a superficial normality, easily pierced. Winterover Syndrome sets in - a clinically recognised cocktail of depression, irritability, insomnia and the Long-Eye, an amnesiac, dreamlike \"fugue state\". Station folklore abounds with stories of the time a Soviet scientist killed a colleague with an axe over a game of chess, or when a fight broke out 1,350km away, in the base at McMurdo Sound, and two navy cooks were attacked with hammers.</p> <p>So when 59-year-old Ronald Shemenski passed a gallstone earlier this month, and the pains he had thought might be pancreatitis continued, his options were limited. He phoned his employers at Raytheon Polar Services in Colorado, which operates the facility for the navy, but the call came several weeks too late to catch a plane home for treatment. Shemenski took a course of antibiotics, but consultation with doctors in the US via telephone and the internet concluded that a life-threatening relapse could not be ruled out: surgery to remove his gall bladder would be needed.</p> <p>Shemenski did not have the option of receiving surgery from the station's only medical doctor: he was the station's only medical doctor. Instead, two weeks ago, navy authorities decided to embark on a rescue mission of unprecedented audacity. For the first time in history, they would land an aeroplane at Amundsen-Scott in winter, and bring Dr Shemenski home.</p> <p>There have been some high-profile Antarctic rescues before - notably that of Shemenski's immediate predecessor, Dr Jerri Nielsen, evacuated in October 1999 after being diagnosed with breast cancer. But that was autumn: \"We were heading into summer with temperatures trending upwards and light conditions improving: we had daylight,\" Colonel Richard Saburro, co-ordinator of the Shemenski evacuation, told reporters. \"Things are reversed now.\"</p> <p>By April 11, the US national science foundation, responsible for the medical side of the operation, announced that it was \"weighing its options\". By April 13, a decision had been made, and three Hercules LC-130 turbo-propellor transport planes, the only heavy aircraft equipped with skis, were scrambled from New York. It was a gamble - the planes are only safe at temperatures above -55C, and it was -60C at the pole - and eventually the foundation's nerve failed. Halfway to Christchurch, New Zealand - the co-ordinating centre for the operation - the planes were recalled. The rescuers could not afford another such moment of indecision: temperatures were falling fast.</p> <p>Instead, the rescuers opted for two de Havilland Twin Otter light aircraft operated by a Canadian company, Kenn Borek Air. It was a triumph of experience and basic reliability over the LC-130s more advanced technology: Borek Air's Otters had been involved in several major polar emergency missions before, including the rescue of a BBC crew plucked from the Arctic in 1996 after they became marooned on an ice floe while filming polar bears. The only problem - an ominous one - was the reduced fuel capacity of the smaller planes: 1,000 gallons, including tanks stored in the passenger area.</p> <p>To provide the Otters with a coastal Antarctic base, the British Antarctic survey opened up the runway and hangar at its Rothera station on Adelaide Island, normally closed for the winter as its own Winteroverers hunkered down for the dark months. On a week-long journey that took them via Chile, the Otters arrived at Rothera on Monday in wind-chilled temperatures of -140C. One would remain there as backup while the other made the 10-hour, 2,500km flight inland to Amundsen-Scott.</p> <p>\"You're heading into a dark and lonely place, which is very, very cold,\" said Steve Penikett, Calgary-based operations manager at Kenn Borek, who spent much of yesterday in nervy satellite-phone communication with his pilots, Sean Loutitt and Mark Cary. \"That's not insurmountable, but you're carrying one-way fuel on each leg, so the pilot has to assure himself of a successful landing at the other end. It's a weather-driven operation: the pilot has to ask himself: at the end of 10 hours, is the weather going to be suitable for landing? Because I don't have a choice of missing it.\"</p> <p>At 10.34am local time on Tuesday - not that the word has much meaning there at the moment - a window in the weather was deemed suitable, and one of the Otters - carrying the two pilots, an engineer, replacement doctor Betty Carlisle and several containers of fuel - took off into the blackness. At Rothera and Amundsen-Scott, there was nothing to do but wait.</p> <p>\"Even in summer, landing is an in credibly tense business,\" says Sara Wheeler, who spent seven months in the Antarctic, and Amundsen-Scott, for her book Terra Incognito. \"The pilots rarely switch off their engines, because if you turned the engine off you'd never get it on again.\" In winter, though, you just can't get out. \"There aren't many places that is true of. And you've got to remember that you're at two-thirds the height of Mount Everest. Nothing works at that temperature: living takes longer, never mind landing aeroplanes.\"</p> <p>Despite the tensions of coming and going, though, Wheeler remembers her time in the frozen south with deep affection. \"To look at the southern lights there in the winter is an experience given to the few,\" she says. Winteroverers are usually only required to serve a single winter, but many end up returning.</p> <p>At Amundsen-Scott, workers prepared for the Otter's landing by lighting debris and pots of fuel along a 600m strip of ice, and Penikett crossed his fingers.</p> <p>Then, finally, shortly after 8pm local time, news crackled through from Amundsen-Scott to Christchurch and Calgary that the Otter was safely down - the first plane to land at the south pole during the polar winter. Heaters were fixed to the engines to prevent them freezing up.</p> <p>In retrospect, the pilots were nonchalant. Asked to describe the flight, Penikett recalls: \"One of them told me he lost several dollars playing crib. It was uneventful. The weather was pretty good, actually.\"</p> <p>It was a day for dramatic landings: hours earlier, at the McMurdo Station on Ross Island, 800 miles away, a New Zealand Air Force aeroplane had evacuated four sick Americans in another operation that was highly unsual for the time of year.</p> <p>The Amundsen-Scott crew rested for 10 hours yesterday, and Dr Carlisle began her six months of isolation. At 5.47pm, after a spot of fog and a small technical difficulty, the Otter took off for Rothera. All being well, they will be back there early today.</p> <p>The disparate countries that share in the administration of the Antarctic under a 1959 treaty do not always get along perfectly (\"Some say America behaves as if it owns the continent,\" says Wheeler). But the rescue missions seem, temporarily at least, to have united them. \"When you're flying into darkness, at the limit of your range, you are utterly reliant on good-quality meteorological information, and what has come out of it so strongly is how the different agencies have networked, mostly using email, to provide accurate information,\" says John Hall, director of operations at the British Antarctic Survey. \"I've just received a message saying this would make a terrific article for an American meteorological journal,\" he adds, voice cracking. \"I'm sorry, I'm getting excited.\"</p> <p>Shemenski's family have kept their counsel for most of the operation but last week Ronald's brother Robert, also a doctor, was persuaded to break his silence and issued a statement in which he expressed his concern for the safety of those taking part. \"We are aware of the dangerous conditions under which they will be flying,\" he wrote. \"Therefore, we hope they have a very safe round-trip journey.\"</p> <p>And in conveying his family's encouragement to Shemenski's replacement at the research station, the statement ended with the warmest expression of support one can bestow on a Winteroverer at Amundsen-Scott.</p> <p>\"We wish Dr Betty Carlisle a very uneventful six months,\" it said.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The news that the Wag lease has been sold, and that this legendary Soho club will soon become an Irish theme pub, marks the end of an era in British nightlife. Since it opened in April 1981, it has been a focus for clubland innovation, a catalyst for racial integration, and a temple to unremitting hedonism. But more than this, this tiny nightclub also symbolised how profoundly our culture has changed over the past two decades.</p> <p>Soho during the mid-70s was a very different country. Anyone frequenting the area was, by definition, of a dubious character. The area was known for brothels, strip-clubs, gambling and drinking dens, and nasty-looking blokes with big fists hanging around in shop doorways. There were no gay pubs, no fast food restaurants, no 24-hour espresso bars, no trendy members' clubs or all-night supermarkets. Neon signs were confined to Piccadilly Circus. Restaurants were few, snotty and expensive. Pubs were approached with caution if you weren't a local. As per the rest of the country, everything was shut by 11 pm.</p> <p>Except nightclubs. Which is why, aged 17 and yearning for life beyond closing time, I set out from Essex for the West End. My mates reckoned the return ticket was a waste of money. \"You'll get cut,\" they warned, as I boarded the train to Fenchurch Street.</p> <p>In 1974 the Wag was still called the Whiskey-A-Go-Go. A huge black man who looked like an extra from Shaft stood outside in black leather jacket and a black fedora with a white silk band, hissing the words \"coke, mary-jane\" at passers-by. Very few, I think, got his drift.</p> <p>Inside, up a steep flight of stairs, one wall was entirely covered in mirror tiles. The ceiling had been plastered crudely and painted silver-grey to resemble a lunar surface, while the supporting pillars were rough approximations of stalactites. On the dancefloor, a skinny bloke with a patchwork leather trenchcoat and flared jeans strutted his syncopated footwork, while gazing at the reflection of his own hennaed perm. A few girls in clogs and minidresses shuffled around him.</p> <p>Soft drinks only, no licence, they said at the bar. A weasly-looking geezer at the next table put me straight. \"Ask for a can from under the counter,\" he grinned. This advice earned me a light ale. Illegal drinking in a black dance club where people wore patchwork leather coats. Could it get any better?</p> <p>It did. After I had sidled onto the dancefloor and spent an hour copying the bloke with the perm, there was a ruccus at the top of the stairs, followed by shouting and a mad scramble as everyone in the club seemd to dash into the men's toilets. By the time the police had actually gained admission, there were discarded joints all over the floor, and the sound of cisterns being flushed could be heard above the music. Two uniformed coppers half-heartedly frisked a couple of punters, while a detective in a mac disappeared into a back room (presumably to get his \"drink\"). They left as quickly as they had arrived. Fantastic. My first night in Soho, and I had witnessed a police raid.</p> <p>Best of all, the Whiskey lasted till 1 am - desperately late, in those sad, forgotten grey days before punk, New Romantic and acid house. It seemed impossibly exotic, this former Soho R&amp;B club which had been popular with Mods, fallen on tough times, and was now the home of an underground scene where young urban blacks and whites mixed together, rubbing elbows with drug dealers and pimps, dancing to records that were never played on radio, a new kind of brassy, sweaty dance music by people such as James Brown, Fatback Band, Ohio Players, and Kool &amp; The Gang.</p> <p>And when you got talking to doormen, they'd tell you how The Who and Jimi Hendrix would drink here, sometimes even jump on stage and jam, if they were in the mood and there was a decent act playing.

      "bodyText": "The news that the Wag lease has been sold, and that this legendary Soho club will soon become an Irish theme pub, marks the end of an era in British nightlife. Since it opened in April 1981, it has been a focus for clubland innovation, a catalyst for racial integration, and a temple to unremitting hedonism. But more than this, this tiny nightclub also symbolised how profoundly our culture has changed over the past two decades. Soho during the mid-70s was a very different country. Anyone frequenting the area was, by definition, of a dubious character. The area was known for brothels, strip-clubs, gambling and drinking dens, and nasty-looking blokes with big fists hanging around in shop doorways. There were no gay pubs, no fast food restaurants, no 24-hour espresso bars, no trendy members' clubs or all-night supermarkets. Neon signs were confined to Piccadilly Circus. Restaurants were few, snotty and expensive. Pubs were approached with caution if you weren't a local. As per the rest of the country, everything was shut by 11 pm. Except nightclubs. Which is why, aged 17 and yearning for life beyond closing time, I set out from Essex for the West End. My mates reckoned the return ticket was a waste of money. \"You'll get cut,\" they warned, as I boarded the train to Fenchurch Street. In 1974 the Wag was still called the Whiskey-A-Go-Go. A huge black man who looked like an extra from Shaft stood outside in black leather jacket and a black fedora with a white silk band, hissing the words \"coke, mary-jane\" at passers-by. Very few, I think, got his drift. Inside, up a steep flight of stairs, one wall was entirely covered in mirror tiles. The ceiling had been plastered crudely and painted silver-grey to resemble a lunar surface, while the supporting pillars were rough approximations of stalactites. On the dancefloor, a skinny bloke with a patchwork leather trenchcoat and flared jeans strutted his syncopated footwork, while gazing at the reflection of his own hennaed perm. A few girls in clogs and minidresses shuffled around him. Soft drinks only, no licence, they said at the bar. A weasly-looking geezer at the next table put me straight. \"Ask for a can from under the counter,\" he grinned. This advice earned me a light ale. Illegal drinking in a black dance club where people wore patchwork leather coats. Could it get any better? It did. After I had sidled onto the dancefloor and spent an hour copying the bloke with the perm, there was a ruccus at the top of the stairs, followed by shouting and a mad scramble as everyone in the club seemd to dash into the men's toilets. By the time the police had actually gained admission, there were discarded joints all over the floor, and the sound of cisterns being flushed could be heard above the music. Two uniformed coppers half-heartedly frisked a couple of punters, while a detective in a mac disappeared into a back room (presumably to get his \"drink\"). They left as quickly as they had arrived. Fantastic. My first night in Soho, and I had witnessed a police raid. Best of all, the Whiskey lasted till 1 am - desperately late, in those sad, forgotten grey days before punk, New Romantic and acid house. It seemed impossibly exotic, this former Soho R&amp;B club which had been popular with Mods, fallen on tough times, and was now the home of an underground scene where young urban blacks and whites mixed together, rubbing elbows with drug dealers and pimps, dancing to records that were never played on radio, a new kind of brassy, sweaty dance music by people such as James Brown, Fatback Band, Ohio Players, and Kool &amp; The Gang. And when you got talking to doormen, they'd tell you how The Who and Jimi Hendrix would drink here, sometimes even jump on stage and jam, if they were in the mood and there was a decent act playing. But in truth, the Whiskey had never been as glamorous or as popular the Flamingo, the jazz and R&amp;B club which occupied the ground floor premises beneath it. And toward the late 70s it seemed a mere shadow of itself, haunted by memories of better times. In 1981 the Whiskey-A-Go-Go became the Wag club, when musician-turned-club-promoter Chris Sullivan and two business partners bought the lease. Sullivan, bored with the relentless monotony of the electronic music favoured by the New Romantic scene which had sprung up in The Blitz and St Moritz clubs, felt it was time to revive the music of his youth. \"At the time, all the West End clubs were playing shit pop music, so I wanted to open somewhere for me and people like me, a cool club with a great mix of music, whether it be jazz or funk or disco or reggae, a different vibe every night,\" he says. Sullivan's idea of a club that changed atmosphere, music and clientele every night was a fresh and radical departure, and soon there were queues down Wardour Street as a hip young crowd of art students, musicians, designers and shop assistants.

      "bodyText": "Racketeers, some of them members of the Provisional IRA or the dissident Real IRA, are raking in millions of pounds from smuggling fuel across the Irish Republic's border with Northern Ireland. The fraudsters make their profits from the huge difference in taxes and duties - about 35p a litre on diesel and 26p on unleaded petrol - between the two parts of the island, and the disparity between sterling and the punt. They also sell laundered agricultural diesel. But their activities are costing the UK Treasury as much as \u00a3300m a year in unpaid taxes, drastically cutting oil companies' sales to Ulster and driving legitimate petrol retailers to the wall. Overall oil imports have halved from 940,000 litres in 1994 to 440,000 last year, and BP now has just 51 outlets in the province, compared with 98 three years ago. \"Fuel smuggling is a major problem,\" said a police source. \"It has its roots in republican areas, and Pira members and dissidents are involved, although it is not clear to what extent some are making money for their organisations or themselves. But by no means is the entire business run by paramilitaries.\" Fuel smugglers are particularly active in the south Armagh and Derry areas, and industry insiders claimed a growing number of petrol sites were leased to paramilitaries. Customs and excise seized 800,000 litres of illegal fuel (smuggled and laundered) in 1998-99 and 1.5m litres in 1999-2000. Last year, customs officers raided 13 laundering plants, capable of producing a total of 40m litres. Tom Nelis, of the customs press office in Belfast, said: \"The fuel comes over the border in all sorts of vehicles, from curtain-sided lorries to specially concealed compartments.

All the examples she gives of why mothers don't use it - such as out-of-date websites and the difficulty in finding information - apply to everyone, not just mothers. The idea that mothers are a special case - \"unadventurous\" in the words of one of her interviewees - is outrageous. </p> <p>To make matters worse, she says that mothers will soon be able to compare notes with other mothers on the web about how to \"get a baby to sleep\" or \"give up chocolate\". How insulting can you get? I've got better things to use the web for - and if I want to talk about babies, I'll go down to the local mother-and-baby group, thank you. <br><strong> Dr Kim Thomas</strong> <br><a href=\"mailto:kim@concat.demon.co.uk\">kim@concat.demon.co.uk</a> </p> <p>I disagree with Deborah Bee; the net fits in very well with working mothers' time-saving strategies.

Yet, in 1966, along with David Lean, William Wyler, John Schlesinger and Robert Wise (the eventual winner for The Sound of Music), there was an obscure Japanese director, Hiroshi Teshigahara, who has died of leukaemia aged 74.</p> <p>The film for which Teshigahara was nominated, and which remains his masterpiece, was Woman In The Dunes (Suna No Onna, 1964), only his second feature, made independently for $100,000. This poetic, erotic allegory told of an entomologist (Eiji Okada) from Tokyo, who finds an attractive young widow (Kyoto Koshoda) living at the bottom of an enormous sandpit on a deserted beach. He becomes her prisoner and has to carry out the Sisyphean task of endlessly shovelling sand to avoid being engulfed, wondering whether he is \"living to shovel or shovelling to live\". Eventually, he becomes like one of the insects he has been studying. Teshigahara and his cinematographer, Hiroshi Segawa, effectively used extreme close-ups until the characters almost become part of the landscape.</p> <p>Adapted by Kobo Abe from his celebrated novel of the same name, the film deals with one of the recurrent themes in modern Japanese literature: the conflict between eastern and western traditions. The westernised scientist gradually gives up material things, and finally accepts his position in the true order of the universe. Both Kobo and Teshigahara had moved away from Marxist ideology (they had been members of the Japanese Communist party in the 1950s) towards a more Taoist philosophy.</p> <p>The formal beauty of the film reflected the director's artistic background. His father was Sofu Teshigahara, a grand master of the Sogetsu school of ikebana (the art of flower arranging), transforming it into a highly expressive art form. Hiroshi studied painting at the Tokyo Art Institute, where he became interested in surrealism and the avant-garde.</p> <p>After a stint as a film critic, he studied cinema technique, making his debut as director of a short documentary on the painter Hokusai (1953). In direct contrast, he shot another short on the middle-weight boxer Jos\u00e9 Torres in New York in 1959.</p> <p>Teshigahara described his first feature, The Pitfall (1961), made by his own production company for a meagre $50,000, as \"a documentary fantasy\". It was written, like most of his films in the 1960s, by Kobo Abe, and revealed a preoccupation with the bizarre. After Woman In The Dunes gained him his Oscar nomination and the Special Jury prize at Cannes, Teshigahara seemed destined to take his place among his contemporaries, Nagisa Oshima, Shohei Imamura and Yoshishige Yoshida, as a leading light of Japanese cinema. It didn't happen.</p> <p>His following two films, both based on Kobo Abe novels, The Face Of Another (1966) and The Man Without A Map (1968), sombre meditations on alienation and the loss of identity, had only limited success. The former, the more interesting film, was about a scientist whose face was disfigured during an industrial explosion. Subsequently, he hides behind a handsome mask and, in this disguise, he seduces his wife and then accuses her of adultery.</p> <p>Teshigahara's next film, Summer Soldiers (1972), which he also photographed, followed the path of an American GI (Keith Sykes) stationed in Japan, who deserts in order to avoid being sent to Vietnam. He and other Americans hide out with Japanese families, constantly moving from one household to the next to avoid arrest. Questions about the American action in Vietnam are raised that were ignored by American films of the time. Shot in a cinema verit\u00e9 style, the film's main weakness lies in the passive performance of the leading actor, a folk-rock singer from Kentucky.</p> <p>After the film failed, Teshigahara decided to concentrate on the traditional arts, such as pottery. In 1980, after the death of his father and sister, Teshigahara became head of the Sogetsu school, which has 450,000 students. However, he didn't abandon film-making altogether, making a feature-length documentary on the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in 1984.</p> <p>The film, full of mesmeric pans and lingering takes, ends with the words, \"Everything comes out of the Great Book of Nature.

She is in the advanced stages of Huntington's disease, a condition that impairs mental and physical ability. Her husband Michael (not his real name), a BBC presenter, had to fight to persuade the crown prosecution service to take on the case but at Reading crown court on Friday, when Archibald was jailed for three years for the rape, Michael had little time to feel vindicated nor Clara to feel safe. Moments after the sentence was passed, Archibald's brother Mark turned to Michael, tried to hit him and said: \"I'll get you for this.

When the victim is especially vulnerable because of a mental or physical illness or a learning disability, the chances of getting a case to court slump even further. The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 contains new provisions to help vulnerable adults give evidence in court, such as judges removing wigs, the erection of screens between witnesses and defendants and video recordings used as evidence. These provisions were supposed to be in place by the end of last year but a Home Office spokesman admits implementation of most could be another year away.</p> <p>Progress has also been slow in the proposed reform of the Sex Offences Act which recommends strengthening the law in cases where a person in a position of trust or responsibility carries out abuse. The Department of Health has guidelines for local authorities to protect vulnerable adults who are abused, but there is no legal requirement to implement them.</p> <p>Tamsin Cottis of Respond, which provides counselling for people with learning difficulties who have been abused, says: \"Decisions can be taken very early on that women like Clara wouldn't make good witnesses. People like her are more vulnerable than others to abuse, yet when they are victims of sex crimes, it is much harder for them to get justice.\"</p> <p>The assumption that Clara would not be a good witness dogged Michael when he tried to get her rape brought to court. Though the crime was witnessed by a wheelchair-bound patient and there was DNA evidence, the CPS said Clara's evidence might not be \"reliable\" because she is a nursing home patient.</p> <p>Michael and Clara met in the early 60s when both worked as journalists on a local paper. They married in 1962 but problems began when Clara developed severe mood swings and obsessional behaviour in her late 40s. The couple separated in the late 80s and it wasn't until 1995 that Clara was diagnosed with Huntington's disease. Michael returned, saying he felt responsible for looking after her, and in January last year she moved into the Buckinghamshire nursing home.</p> <p>The rape took place when another resident invited Clara, a compulsive smoker, into his room for a cigarette. John Archibald, who was visiting a relative, and his brother Mark came too. Mark handed Clara two cannabis cigarettes. She had never tried the drug before and did not know it was in the cigarettes. After smoking them, she tried to return to her room but John Archibald forced her on to the bed and raped her twice.</p> <p>Clara says the attack is the worst thing that has ever happened to her. \"I felt so unclean and they hurt me so badly. My body took weeks to recover.\"</p> <p>The next morning staff told Michael what had happened and Clara was taken to a local rape centre where she was examined by a police doctor and video evidence was taken. However, the CPS decided not to prosecute and it took Michael four months to persuade them to change their minds. \"I believe she was singled out because she was vulnerable. I had to fight for her, she couldn't fight for herself. I kept insisting that it was their duty to pursue the case, that they had DNA evidence, a witness and my wife's testimony.\"</p> <p>The case finally came to court last November and the jury convicted John Archibald of the rape. Clara did not give evidence in court.</p> <p>Often the only course open to a victim if the CPS decides not to pursue the case is to take out a civil action, not against the perpetrator but, in a case like Clara's, against the nursing home for allowing visitors to be left alone with her without supervision. And victims are sometimes unable to communicate what has happened to them or are too terrified to talk.</p> <p>Christiana Horrocks, director of Voice, which provides support for adults and children with learning disabilities who have been abused, says: \"Sometimes the reasons given to victims to stop them talking are even more evil than the abuse. One young woman was raped by a man who knew her mother was in remission from cancer. He told her if she said anything about the attack, her mother would die from the cancer.\"</p> <p>Harriet Wistrich, a solicitor who advises women making complaints about the way their rape investigations have been handled, says women need to be \"perfect victims\" to avoid running into difficulties if the case goes to court. \"Saying a woman consented is often used by the defence,\" she points out. \"Even if there is evidence of serious bruises and other injuries, the defence may say: 'She just liked it rough.' There are so many rapes in children's and residential homes, and psychiatric institutions, because rapists know they can get away with it there.\"</p> <p>Janine (not her real name), a 26-year-old who had been receiving treatment for severe anorexia and a personality disorder, was at a low ebb when she met a man who was kind to her. She had walked out of a hospital psychiatric ward and had nowhere to go. He offered her a bed for the night at the hostel he was staying at. Once there, he trapped her in his bedroom and force-fed her cannabis and crack before raping her four times. The drug cocktail paralysed her for several hours and it was only when her attacker finally fell asleep that she managed to half walk, half fall out of his bedroom, collapsing in the hostel office. Her heart stopped but she was resuscitated and taken to hospital.</p> <p>\"I told the staff what had happened and they reported it to the police. But the officer who came to see me was so hard.

      "bodyText": "A father of two sacked by his employer for taking time off after the birth of his second child, yesterday won compensation at an industrial tribunal. Backed by the GMB union, bus driver Dean Matthews claimed his dismissal was in breach of recent family-friendly legislation, even though he had been with Stagecoach North East for less than twelve months. Mr Matthews, 23, of Sunderland received a \u00a32,000 payout. A union statement said he had missed a shift when his partner, Karen Priest, was in labour in August last year. It said he returned home after the birth to find a letter telling him a disciplinary hearing was to be held the following day at which he would be dismissed for his poor attendance record. During the pregnancy, Mr Matthews had taken time off to care for his partner when she was ill, and to look after his one-year-old daughter. He challenged the dismissal under section 57a of the Employment Rights Act 1999. His solicitor, David Mole, said it was the first time the laws had been used successfully by a claimant. A GMB union spokesman said: \"This section allows time off to care for dependants such as partners and children from day one of employment rather than the normal 12 month qualifying period for unfair dismissal.\" Mr Matthews said: \"I am delighted to have stood up for the rights of dads and won.\" Stagecoach North East said: \"In the short period of time he worked for us, Mr Matthews had a very poor attendance record and had been through every stage of the formal disciplinary process. \"However, the timing of his dismissal was clearly unfortunate and Stagecoach accept this.\"",

She arranged to pick her up the next evening for a PTA meeting, but late the following morning received a text message from her friend saying she could not go to the meeting as her mother was ill. During the following week, Ms Zeraschi said, she made repeated telephone calls, sent text messages and visited the house, but heard nothing from her friend or the family. By the evening of Sunday, July 23, Ms Zeraschi was \"very concerned\" and called the police after taking a ladder to look through Luke's bedroom window, where she said she saw a \"shape\" in the bed.
