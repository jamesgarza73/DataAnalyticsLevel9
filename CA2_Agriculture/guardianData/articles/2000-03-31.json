HSBC (formerly Midland) has closed \"only\" 53 branches in the last seven years and this week it actually opened a new one. The chosen location is the Waitrose supermarket in Twyford, Berks, a town that has just one other bank branch. It will be open the same hours as the supermarket (seven days a week, for a total of 73 hours) and HSBC indicated that if it is a success, it may open branches in other Waitrose stores.

Mr Obolensky dismissed any suggestion that this is anything other than hard-headed business sense. \"It's not about democracy,\" he insisted. \"It's about the most effective way of getting to a solution a company needs to compete more effectively.

He is chief executive of Redcliffe Magtronics, a small Bristol-based technology business which he is currently trying to turn round. Its history is as a manufacturer of nuclear engineering instrumentation, mainly for the marine division of Rolls-Royce. He believes its future is in magnetic technology, which he describes as \"the next silicon chip\". Mr Parsons signed up for the Tomorrow's Company treatment as part of a process of transforming the business and developing a new strategy supported by all participants. \"We had a fairly significant strategic review and now a strategic plan which I wanted to engage the whole workforce in.

At a stormy annual meeting there were cries of \"shame\" and \"out\" as the chairman, John Roques, defended the decision to throw out the members who backed a conversion campaign coordinated by the website carpetbagger.com. Bournemouth-based Portman terminated their membership in January, saying they had mounted a \"carefully coordinated attack on the society\" which had disrupted the business. While Mr Roques was keen to draw a line under the affair, it emerged later that the leader of the conversion campaign, Richard Yendall, has drawn up resolutions for next year's annual meeting condemning the society's actions as \"anti-democratic\" and calling on the board to apologise personally to each of those expelled. One of these, David Hawkins, of Bampton, Oxfordshire, disclosed he had been offered \u00a350 compensation by the Portman after he complained about the society's actions and threatened to take the matter to court. Mr Hawkins said he had rejected the offer and wanted the society to reinstate him as a full member. During the meeting at the Paragon hotel, in Earls Court, London, one man told the board that in throwing out hundreds of members because they did not like the resolution put forward, they were \"acting as if you were in the Soviet Union in the old days\". All but one of the 377 had been offered the chance to become members again, provided they sign away to charity the right to any future windfall, said Mr Roques.

      "body": "<p>The auction for licences to operate the next generation of mobile phones burst through the \u00a310bn mark yesterday and showed no sign of easing. </p> <p>All 13 bidders that lined up at the beginning of the process four weeks ago are still competing and analysts whose predictions have been dramatically outstripped are reluctant to forecast where it will stop. A price of at least \u00a33bn per licence seems realistic which would take the total to \u00a315bn. </p> <p>At least half the winning bids must be paid immediately to the Treasury with the remainder due over 10 years. </p> <p>The next generation networks, which use the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) standard, will enable high-speed internet access and high-quality video over handsets. The value of the licences is underscored by predictions that mobile phones could overtake personal computers as the main means of accessing the web. </p> <p>At the close of round 91 the Virgin-led SpectrumCo headed the bidding for licence A, the largest licence which has been reserved for new entrants, with an offer of \u00a32.1bn. In licence B, Vodafone had tabled a bid of \u00a32.23bn. </p> <p>MCI WorldCom, the aggressive US telecoms company is leading the auction for licence C with a \u00a31.88bn bid while Spain's national telephone company, Telefonica, tops bids for licence D with \u00a31.89bn. NTL, Britain's biggest cable company, backed by France Telecom, is leading the bids for licence E with a \u00a31.95bn offer. </p> <p>None of the current highest bidders is allowed to make an offer in the next round. </p> <p>\"It's like a game of poker where no one has yet blinked,\" one telecoms analyst said. \"Bidders are moving from one licence to another and it is difficult to unpick anyone's strategies.\" </p> <p>Original analyst estimates suggested the licences would go for a combined \u00a31.5bn-\u00a32bn. The government's combined reserve price for the licences, \u00a3500m, now seems laughably low. </p> <p>There have been suggestions that existing operators were driving up prices to offset damage caused if an new entrant won a licence. \"It may seem cynical but even if you aren't going to win you can make sure all the value of getting a licence disappears from the company that secures them,\" the analyst said. </p> <p>Because of the public nature of the auction, none of the participants wants to be the first to crumble, however. </p> <p>Some observers believed bids have reached a level that could impede take-up of third generation services because of the costs which could be passed on to consumers. The price of building up a network for an existing operator is likely to be around \u00a33bn . </p> <p>Orange, One2One and BT Cellnet remain in contention, along with Canada's TIW, Crescent Wireless, a vehicle for Global Crossing of the US, Nomura subsidiary Epsilon, OneTel, backed by Kerry Packer and Rupert Murdoch, and Eircom subsidiary 3GUK. </p> <p>In April last year the US government raised $4bn from one auction of mobile licences. However, it was forced to repeat the entire process after a number of the winners defaulted on their payments. </p> <p>The second time round the auction raised $412m - just one-tenth of the original closing price.</p>",

A price of at least \u00a33bn per licence seems realistic which would take the total to \u00a315bn. At least half the winning bids must be paid immediately to the Treasury with the remainder due over 10 years. The next generation networks, which use the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) standard, will enable high-speed internet access and high-quality video over handsets. The value of the licences is underscored by predictions that mobile phones could overtake personal computers as the main means of accessing the web. At the close of round 91 the Virgin-led SpectrumCo headed the bidding for licence A, the largest licence which has been reserved for new entrants, with an offer of \u00a32.1bn. In licence B, Vodafone had tabled a bid of \u00a32.23bn. MCI WorldCom, the aggressive US telecoms company is leading the auction for licence C with a \u00a31.88bn bid while Spain's national telephone company, Telefonica, tops bids for licence D with \u00a31.89bn. NTL, Britain's biggest cable company, backed by France Telecom, is leading the bids for licence E with a \u00a31.95bn offer. None of the current highest bidders is allowed to make an offer in the next round. \"It's like a game of poker where no one has yet blinked,\" one telecoms analyst said. \"Bidders are moving from one licence to another and it is difficult to unpick anyone's strategies.\" Original analyst estimates suggested the licences would go for a combined \u00a31.5bn-\u00a32bn. The government's combined reserve price for the licences, \u00a3500m, now seems laughably low. There have been suggestions that existing operators were driving up prices to offset damage caused if an new entrant won a licence. \"It may seem cynical but even if you aren't going to win you can make sure all the value of getting a licence disappears from the company that secures them,\" the analyst said. Because of the public nature of the auction, none of the participants wants to be the first to crumble, however. Some observers believed bids have reached a level that could impede take-up of third generation services because of the costs which could be passed on to consumers. The price of building up a network for an existing operator is likely to be around \u00a33bn . Orange, One2One and BT Cellnet remain in contention, along with Canada's TIW, Crescent Wireless, a vehicle for Global Crossing of the US, Nomura subsidiary Epsilon, OneTel, backed by Kerry Packer and Rupert Murdoch, and Eircom subsidiary 3GUK. In April last year the US government raised $4bn from one auction of mobile licences. However, it was forced to repeat the entire process after a number of the winners defaulted on their payments. The second time round the auction raised $412m - just one-tenth of the original closing price.",

The housing slump that was to many Britons the most unexpected and painful aspect of the early 90s recession can now be consigned to the history books. </p> <p>But have we learned from history and changed our attitudes to housing? Or is yet another housing boom to be followed by repossessions and negative equity? Don't bother to ask moneylenders, for they are falling over each other to fuel the market. Figures from the Bank of England shows mortgage approvals jumping to 105,000, the highest for over two years and well above the average of about 98,000 in the previous three months. </p> <p>Today marks the start of the Easter house-hunting season, with several lenders launching new home loan packages with cheque book grabbing rates. Britannia Building Society has come up with a two-year discounted deal that trims 2.1% off its standard variable rate of 7.64% for buyers with a down payment of at least 10%.The society is even more generous to cash-rich borrowers with a deposit worth at least 25% of the value of the property. They will have repayments pegged at 2.15% below the current variable rate of 7.64% at 5.48% for the next two years. </p> <p>The Bank of Ireland's UK offshoot, Bristol &amp; West, is wooing buyers with a conscience. Its new mortgage package offers a one-year fixed-rate home loan at 5.99% followed by a 1% discount off base mortgage rates for the next two years. Successful applications then trigger a charitable donation equivalent to 1% of the total advance. The three charities it supports are Cancer &amp; Leukaemia in Childhood, the Bristol Children's Hospital and Cancer Research. </p> <p>Birmingham Midshires, is switching to the daily method of charging interest on mortgage balances.This approach means that the mortgage balance on which interest is calculated is immediately reduced when capital is repaid, cutting the outstanding debt more quickly. </p> <p>John Charcol is offering a discounted mortgage whereby the discount drops from 1.75% to 1.55% over three years on a sliding scale. At present borrowers will repay the mortgage at 6% without any penalties for switching lenders in the future. The mortgage adviser has worked out that on a loan of \u00a3100,000 the deal would save around \u00a3145 a month in the first year. </p> <p>And another mortgage broker, Chase De Vere has launched a new mortgage offering a cocktail of a fixed rate, a discount and a flexible redemption penalty policy. Its Three-way Mortgage, which has an upfront fee of \u00a3300, comes with a one-year fixed rate of 5.99% until May 1, 2001, a 1.25% discount stretching to May 1, 2003 and no redemption penalties on 25% of the original loan. </p> <p>But watch out for the 2% early redemption levy on any amount above 25% of the mortgage that you might repay before that date. This is a charge made by your mortgage lender which is payable on certain types of loan - usually discounted or fixed interest rate loans - and is applied if the loan is paid off or part-redeemed within the specified period. </p> <p>This, the lenders argue, is the quid pro quo of benefiting from the constant rates or the low-cost mortgage offered by discounted rates. </p> <p>For the self-employed, the Mortgage Operation has launched two special deals. Its Multi-Purpose Discount deal offers a 1.5% discount until February 1, 2002, with an initial payable rate of 6.28%. And its SelfCert Base Tracker, aimed at borrowers with adverse credit, has a 0.4% discount to March 1, 2002 with an underlying rate which tracks base rate, giving an initial payable rate of 7.24%. </p> <p>\u0095 Money Unlimited, the Guardian's internet operation, is running a competition whereby readers can win a year- long mortgage repayment holiday worth up to \u00a3100,000.

Figures from the Bank of England shows mortgage approvals jumping to 105,000, the highest for over two years and well above the average of about 98,000 in the previous three months. Today marks the start of the Easter house-hunting season, with several lenders launching new home loan packages with cheque book grabbing rates. Britannia Building Society has come up with a two-year discounted deal that trims 2.1% off its standard variable rate of 7.64% for buyers with a down payment of at least 10%.The society is even more generous to cash-rich borrowers with a deposit worth at least 25% of the value of the property. They will have repayments pegged at 2.15% below the current variable rate of 7.64% at 5.48% for the next two years. The Bank of Ireland's UK offshoot, Bristol &amp; West, is wooing buyers with a conscience. Its new mortgage package offers a one-year fixed-rate home loan at 5.99% followed by a 1% discount off base mortgage rates for the next two years. Successful applications then trigger a charitable donation equivalent to 1% of the total advance. The three charities it supports are Cancer &amp; Leukaemia in Childhood, the Bristol Children's Hospital and Cancer Research. Birmingham Midshires, is switching to the daily method of charging interest on mortgage balances.This approach means that the mortgage balance on which interest is calculated is immediately reduced when capital is repaid, cutting the outstanding debt more quickly. John Charcol is offering a discounted mortgage whereby the discount drops from 1.75% to 1.55% over three years on a sliding scale. At present borrowers will repay the mortgage at 6% without any penalties for switching lenders in the future. The mortgage adviser has worked out that on a loan of \u00a3100,000 the deal would save around \u00a3145 a month in the first year. And another mortgage broker, Chase De Vere has launched a new mortgage offering a cocktail of a fixed rate, a discount and a flexible redemption penalty policy. Its Three-way Mortgage, which has an upfront fee of \u00a3300, comes with a one-year fixed rate of 5.99% until May 1, 2001, a 1.25% discount stretching to May 1, 2003 and no redemption penalties on 25% of the original loan. But watch out for the 2% early redemption levy on any amount above 25% of the mortgage that you might repay before that date. This is a charge made by your mortgage lender which is payable on certain types of loan - usually discounted or fixed interest rate loans - and is applied if the loan is paid off or part-redeemed within the specified period. This, the lenders argue, is the quid pro quo of benefiting from the constant rates or the low-cost mortgage offered by discounted rates. For the self-employed, the Mortgage Operation has launched two special deals. Its Multi-Purpose Discount deal offers a 1.5% discount until February 1, 2002, with an initial payable rate of 6.28%. And its SelfCert Base Tracker, aimed at borrowers with adverse credit, has a 0.4% discount to March 1, 2002 with an underlying rate which tracks base rate, giving an initial payable rate of 7.24%. \u0095 Money Unlimited, the Guardian's internet operation, is running a competition whereby readers can win a year- long mortgage repayment holiday worth up to \u00a3100,000. The winner can also visit Money Unlimited for some straightforward advice on how to invest the cash they've saved. Details on www.moneyunlimited.co.uk",

No party has a majority.</p> <p>In imposing unprecedented conditions on the Ashcroft honour, the three-strong public honours scrutiny committee (PHSC), which vetoed the controversial financier's nomination last year, insisted that a foreign-domiciled tycoon could hardly be a working peer, willing to turn up regularly and vote on the legislative treadmill.</p> <p>In last-minute wrangling the committee - Lord Hurd (Tory), Lady Dean (Labour), and its chairman, Lord Thomson (Lib Dem) - did not reject Mr Hague's nominee outright. But they demanded his \"clear and unequivocal assurance\" that he will come home to live and pay his taxes. \"That really is quite unprecedented,\" said one insider.</p> <p>The struggle follows prolonged newspaper criticism of his business track record last year, including claims of money-laundering, leading to an Ashcroft libel suit against the Times, settled out of court.</p> <p>Senior Tories deny claims that Mr Hague had to plead directly with Tony Blair for his candidate. Downing Street said discussions were \"nothing to do with us\", but confined to the PHSC.</p> <p>The dispute was only resolved this week.</p> <p>Last night Labour and Liberal Democrats denounced the new Lord Ashcroft as a \"conditional peer\" for whom the rules had been bent because he had given \u00a33m from his \u00a31bn fortune to shore up the Tories.</p> <p>The Labour MP Peter Bradley warned that Mr Hague would regret his \"coronets-for-cash deal\" on behalf of a tax exile who had been Belize's UN ambassador. Mr Ashcroft has now resigned that post, senior Tories revealed last night.</p> <p>Mr Ashcroft himself said that he was \"thrilled and honoured\" to be able to make a contribution to the Lords \"as a businessman, a campaigner against drugs and as a political party fundraiser\".</p> <p>So close and important is Mr Ashcroft's relationship to Tory party financial affairs that some Labour experts believe his elevation breaches the 1925 Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act, which explicitly forbids attempts to procure honours in return for \"gifts, money or valuable considerations\".</p> <p>The legislation followed the Liberal prime minister Lloyd George's blatant sale of honours. Some Tory MPs and peers are privately appalled, but party HQ loyally stood by the man who pays the bills.</p> <p>The Tories pointed to Labour's nomination of the retired TV executive Alexander Bernstein as a known \u00a35,000 Labour donor, and again accused Mr Blair of \"packing the Lords full of cronies\". In fact No10 found it hard to find people of talent willing to do the work and reputedly trawled the City and academia.</p> <p>Daniel Brennan QC, chairman of the bar council, is on the Labour list. So is the TUC veteran Bill Jordan, and Janet Cohen, an ex-BBC governor and banker. Among the Lib Dem nominees, picked by Charles Kennedy from a list voted for by his party conference, is the grassroots activist and troublemaker Tony Greaves.</p> <p>In his long career as the epitome of bearded and uncompromising Liberalism, untainted by the fleshpots of London, few colleagues would ever have seen Mr Greaves accepting ermine.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Conservative party treasurer, Michael Ashcroft, last night suffered the public indignity of having his long-coveted peerage explicitly made conditional upon his return from tax exile to live permanently in Britain - by the end of this year. The Florida-based billionaire, who has pumped \u00a31m a year into William Hague's defeated Tory party since 1997, is the most eyecatching name on the list of 33 working peers announced this morning. Twenty are Labour, including the economist Richard Layard, the publisher Matthew Evans of Faber &amp; Faber, the academic and race relations expert Professor Bhikhu Parekh, and five hereditary grandees restored to the Lords by Downing Street patronage. With the Conservatives confined to four newcomers and the Liberal Democrats to nine, Labour now has more life peers than the Tories in the half-reformed Lords, 198 to 184. No party has a majority. In imposing unprecedented conditions on the Ashcroft honour, the three-strong public honours scrutiny committee (PHSC), which vetoed the controversial financier's nomination last year, insisted that a foreign-domiciled tycoon could hardly be a working peer, willing to turn up regularly and vote on the legislative treadmill. In last-minute wrangling the committee - Lord Hurd (Tory), Lady Dean (Labour), and its chairman, Lord Thomson (Lib Dem) - did not reject Mr Hague's nominee outright. But they demanded his \"clear and unequivocal assurance\" that he will come home to live and pay his taxes. \"That really is quite unprecedented,\" said one insider. The struggle follows prolonged newspaper criticism of his business track record last year, including claims of money-laundering, leading to an Ashcroft libel suit against the Times, settled out of court. Senior Tories deny claims that Mr Hague had to plead directly with Tony Blair for his candidate. Downing Street said discussions were \"nothing to do with us\", but confined to the PHSC. The dispute was only resolved this week. Last night Labour and Liberal Democrats denounced the new Lord Ashcroft as a \"conditional peer\" for whom the rules had been bent because he had given \u00a33m from his \u00a31bn fortune to shore up the Tories. The Labour MP Peter Bradley warned that Mr Hague would regret his \"coronets-for-cash deal\" on behalf of a tax exile who had been Belize's UN ambassador. Mr Ashcroft has now resigned that post, senior Tories revealed last night. Mr Ashcroft himself said that he was \"thrilled and honoured\" to be able to make a contribution to the Lords \"as a businessman, a campaigner against drugs and as a political party fundraiser\". So close and important is Mr Ashcroft's relationship to Tory party financial affairs that some Labour experts believe his elevation breaches the 1925 Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act, which explicitly forbids attempts to procure honours in return for \"gifts, money or valuable considerations\". The legislation followed the Liberal prime minister Lloyd George's blatant sale of honours. Some Tory MPs and peers are privately appalled, but party HQ loyally stood by the man who pays the bills. The Tories pointed to Labour's nomination of the retired TV executive Alexander Bernstein as a known \u00a35,000 Labour donor, and again accused Mr Blair of \"packing the Lords full of cronies\". In fact No10 found it hard to find people of talent willing to do the work and reputedly trawled the City and academia. Daniel Brennan QC, chairman of the bar council, is on the Labour list. So is the TUC veteran Bill Jordan, and Janet Cohen, an ex-BBC governor and banker. Among the Lib Dem nominees, picked by Charles Kennedy from a list voted for by his party conference, is the grassroots activist and troublemaker Tony Greaves. In his long career as the epitome of bearded and uncompromising Liberalism, untainted by the fleshpots of London, few colleagues would ever have seen Mr Greaves accepting ermine.",

What began in the US as the \"dress-down Friday\" trend has snowballed. Now, many former suit-clad offices are a sea of Gap khakis. </p> <p>The full force of the shift hit me in Sainsbury's when, unable to find what I was looking for, I instinctively scanned the horizon for a shop assistant wearing patterned nylon. No joy - but, on closer inspection, there was a distinctly higher-than-average number of orange fleeces bobbing around. Orange is, of course, very fashionable this season, but I'm under no illusions that anyone will actually wear it. No: the orange fleeces are the new Sainsbury's uniform. </p> <p>Now that dressing down for work has spread from ad agency brainstormings to supermarket aisles, the clothing industry has seized the opportunity to sell us a whole new wardrobe to replace those stuffy old suits. Companies such as Gap and French Connection are reaping the benefits of demand for simply-cut trousers, knitwear and good-quality open-collared shirts. So it was only a matter of time before someone came up with a snappy name for it: clear your wardrobes for \"career casual\". </p> <p>In the US, which is light years ahead of us in the dressing-down stakes, career casual departments are springing up in every store. (Some brands did try to push \"business appropriate\", but the less-than-snappy phrase didn't stick.) For men, there are cotton chinos, open-necked shirts, short-sleeved shirts, v-neck sweaters; for women, separates and knitwear but with detailing - a scalloped hem, a three-quarter length sleeve - that demarcates them from old-school office-wear. Brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and DKNY are planning new ranges aimed at the casual office, while Levi's is making inroads on the same market by investing heavily in the chino boom: for many people for whom jeans are still too casual for the office, chinos have become a staple. The clothes themselves are nothing new, but the signposting is - what retailers have realised is that while most of us prefer a casual dress code, we are as yet unconfident as to the precise boundaries of it. Career casual departments take the uncertainty out of the new working wardrobe. </p> <p>Last week, when New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft announced that it was joining Goldman Sachs &amp; Co and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as part of the first wave of Wall St firms to adopt a casual dress code, it revealed that the company had asked Polo Ralph Lauren to give seminars to its staff on how to dress down. A seminar in the finer points of not doing the top button of your shirt up might seem excessive to those who are comfortable with a casual office, but not everyone is. An employee of a London law firm that has recently gone casual has noticed that \"the older people here seem really uncomfortable about giving up suits.\" </p> <p>Ten years ago, media had turned casual, while business was still formal - but the dot.com frenzy, which has highlighted twentysomethings in jeans as the new business leaders, is changing this. Additionally, law and management consultancy firms whose clients are increasingly casual are following suit. Robert O Link, managing partner of Cadwalader, says: \"A number of our leading clients have gone casual full-time and it is important that they be comfortable around us.\" </p> <p>Men are the easiest prey for the career casual hard sell, because they are less well-versed in the infinite steps on the ladder between beachwear and black tie. Women, on the other hand, are on familiar territory: in any changing room you'll hear women discussing whether this suede skirt is acceptable for work if worn with a sober jumper, or whether that skirt could be dressed up with high heels, or if the colour of that jacket makes it a bit too garish for daytime. Office casual is not, after all, a question of swapping a pinstripe suit for jeans and trainers: each office, even each department, has its own often unspoken rules, which might exclude trainers but include jeans, or include both but not together. In such a minefield, men end up playing safe. Just as women inject more variety into their outfits in a formal office than men do, in a casual office there is often a tighter \"uniform\" among the men - say, khakis and white shirt, or in a more casual office, jeans and a short-sleeved shirt. </p> <p>As personal shopping manager for Harvey Nichols, Christina Abbott has been besieged with calls from men demanding her help. \"Lots of them are the husbands of my clients. Suddenly they've been given a casual dress code at work, and they don't know what to do.\" Abbott has also been targeted by \"lots of city companies\" to help them and their staff get to grips with a casual office. She teaches them about colour and fabric, explaining that if you stick to a neutral palette, you can experiment with more outlandish styles. Some men, of course, are adept at this - the hordes of young men who sport purple or green YSL shirts on a Saturday night have clearly figured out the dress-up power of colour. \"It's the same for women, of course. I wouldn't send someone to work in a hooded sweatshirt if it was in bright pink, but if it was DKNY, say, in a neutral colour and really beautiful wool, and was paired with perfectly tailored trousers, it might look right.\" </p> <p> Despite the pitfalls, most people prefer not having to be suited and booted. A recent US survey found that non-suited workers not only felt happier, but were also perceived by others as \"more reasonable\" and \"nicer\". The casualwear companies are even happier: Anita Borzwszkowska, European PR director for The Gap, admits the casual office trend is \"a tremendous opportunity for us\". Borzwszkowska predicts that the trend will plateau - \"We're not going to be wearing tracksuit bottoms to the office\" - but that more companies will join in. </p> <p>Career casual departments may turn out to be a short-lived phenomenon: many in the retail industry predict that we will move towards a homogenised work-to-weekend wardrobe. The most lasting effect of the casual office trend is likely to be to encourage men to think about what they wear. \"The nice thing about the drive towards smart casual for men is that it smartens up their weekend wardrobe,\" says Abbott. Borzwszkowska agrees: when men can't hide behind a suit, they \"need to put a bit more effort into what they wear. And having to make an effort has taken the stigma out of making an effort.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Economic growth in the United States surged ahead at its fastest pace for nearly 16 years in the final quarter of last year despite repeated attempts by the Federal Reserve to slow it down by raising interest rates. Confirming expectations of more monetary tightening to come, the commerce department said that gross domestic product growth accelerated to a blistering annual rate of 7.3% between October and December, an upward revision from the previously reported 6.9%. It was the most vigorous quarterly growth rate since the 9% recorded in the first quarter of 1984 when the American economy was recovering from recession. The figures showed that growth was evenly balanced, with all the main components strongly up. The Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates five times since last summer in an effort to brake the pace of expansion and prevent inflation taking off. But yesterday's figures reinforced speculation in financial markets of a more aggressive stance in future months. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago president Michael Moskow said incremental rate rises had been appropriate so far, but that the Federal Reserve was reassessing that. Noting that the average US growth rate of 4.5% in the past few years was unsustainable, Mr Moskow said: \"It is appropriate for us to move in the fashion we have in order to maximise the chances that our policy is going to be effective.\" William McDonough, president of the New York Fed bank, said the US central bank was prepared to keep raising interest rates until it saw clear signs of a deceleration in consumer spending.",

Experts had predicted the eruption because of increased seismic activity that began earlier this week, and the evacuation of more than 11,000 people began on Wednesday.</p> <p>Almost immediately after the eruption, volcanic ash began to rain down on nearby towns. Residents downwind were soon also enveloped by the pungent, rotten smell of sulphur. The coast guard, military and police mobilised to evacuate the town of Abuta, which lies between the volcano and the sea. It has a population of 13,000, but thousands had already been evacuated and it was not immediately known how many people were still there.</p> <p>Seven ships, two helicopters and several dozen trucks were deployed amid concerns at the possibility of landslides or mudslides caused by melting snow. Before the eruption, snow 1ft deep covered much of the 2,416-ft volcano. There had been no rumbling, no explosion and no screams. Mount Usu erupted in the afternoon in near silence, just a blue-grey plume of rock and ash billowing over the crater and down the snowy slopes.</p> <p>\"I didn't feel anything, I didn't hear anything,\" said Norimichi Nagao, a resident of nearby Date, which escaped the ash fall. \"I didn't know there was an eruption until I saw it on television.\" With so many residents in the three towns evacuated, the eruption became more of a public spectacle than a threat. People rushed onto the streets and rooftops to take photographs, relaxed and prepared after days of high-level warnings.</p> <p>Cars coming in from other areas around the mountain were covered in dust, however, and Abuta and Sobetsu were ghost towns. \"Some kids and some parents are a bit jittery, but you couldn't call this a panic,\" said Daisuke Kadoaki, an official at the Abuta town office. He said nearly all of the residents had left.</p> <p>The number of people in evacuation centres is however expected to rise. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has warned that evacuees may have to stay put for a while, and said the government would consider building temporary housing. At the centres, where families are marking off private space with blankets and cardboard partitions, officials are concerned about the effects of stress.</p> <p>Two people were killed and 200 homes destroyed in mudslides following Usu's last eruptions, which began in 1977 and continued for several months into the following year. Today, the plume rose from the volcano amid generally clear skies. Within two hours, it had risen to a height of 10,560 feet. Mobile phone service was briefly cut off, but was quickly restored. Some domestic flights to Hokkaido were suspended, but international flights were not delayed.</p> <p>Most of the ash appeared to be wafting northeast over a nearby lake, and not over the more populous areas. \"We are worried that the wind direction will change,\" said Date mayor Hidekichi Kikuya. \"We have been spared so far, but that could change.\"</p> <p>This is the seventh major eruption of Mount Usu in the past 300 years. Fifty people died when the volcano erupted in 1822 in its most lethal eruption. Japan, one of the world's most eruption-prone countries, has not had a fatal eruption since 1991. An eruption of the 4,459-foot Mount Unzen that year sent avalanches of hot rocks sweeping through the outskirts of the town of Shimabara, in southern Japan, killing 43 people and leaving nearly 2,300 homeless. Officials were concerned that Usu would also spew a similar mix of gas and rocks.</p>",

Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has warned that evacuees may have to stay put for a while, and said the government would consider building temporary housing. At the centres, where families are marking off private space with blankets and cardboard partitions, officials are concerned about the effects of stress. Two people were killed and 200 homes destroyed in mudslides following Usu's last eruptions, which began in 1977 and continued for several months into the following year. Today, the plume rose from the volcano amid generally clear skies. Within two hours, it had risen to a height of 10,560 feet. Mobile phone service was briefly cut off, but was quickly restored. Some domestic flights to Hokkaido were suspended, but international flights were not delayed. Most of the ash appeared to be wafting northeast over a nearby lake, and not over the more populous areas. \"We are worried that the wind direction will change,\" said Date mayor Hidekichi Kikuya. \"We have been spared so far, but that could change.\" This is the seventh major eruption of Mount Usu in the past 300 years. Fifty people died when the volcano erupted in 1822 in its most lethal eruption. Japan, one of the world's most eruption-prone countries, has not had a fatal eruption since 1991. An eruption of the 4,459-foot Mount Unzen that year sent avalanches of hot rocks sweeping through the outskirts of the town of Shimabara, in southern Japan, killing 43 people and leaving nearly 2,300 homeless. Officials were concerned that Usu would also spew a similar mix of gas and rocks.",

      "bodyText": "Benot Mariage's The Carriers are Waiting is a feature debut of enormous charm: a real jewel of a film in a crisp monochrome setting with something of Bruno Dumont or Ken Loach, but its own very distinctive seriocomic address to the audience. Roger, an eccentric press photographer (Benot Poelvoorde), maddened by his squalid, dead-end job, harangues his family over dinner that they should make something of their lives - and decides the answer is to enter a local competition for anyone who can beat any existing world record. He forces his hapless son Michel (Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Devigne) to have a crack at the world door-opening record: 40,000 times in 24 hours. Poelvoorde's performance as the tattered paterfamilias is delightful and Michel's practice sessions in the garden, in which a door has been installed, are positively Pythonesque.",

As for casting, \"The family/estate have final say on the scriptwriter, director, and lots of other details, but the studio gets to pick an 'A' list star to headline the picture. Dustin Hoffman was nixed because he's 'not popular enough'.\" Rumours that Nic Cage might play the candyman are still just that. Apparently Dahl hated the 1971 film, starring Gene Wilder. The author had wanted British comedian Spike Milligan to play Willy Wonka, but was overruled.",

Thus: \"Dear AB, Your invaluable suggestions and assistance, not to mention your kindness, in entirely re-writing chapter three, entitles you, surely, to this first copy of 'Tess'. From your old friend, T Hardy.\" </p> <p>O'Brien was one of the greatest comic writers of all time. But don't take my word for it; try those of James Joyce, who said that O'Brien was \"a real writer with the true comic spirit\". Or Dylan Thomas's: \"In the forefront of contemporary Irish writing\". These are the quotations on the back of the Picador edition of O'Brien's novel The Third Policeman. </p> <p>How did O'Brien's publishers come up with these quotes? Did they ply Joyce with expense account luncheons? After all, a quote from a fashionable literary name can add thousands to the sales. If you can get Nick Hornby to write, \"I laughed, I cried, I became a Buddhist and had an irreversible vasectomy. Such is the power of this extraordinary book\", then you can forget about review quotes or literary awards. </p> <p>Links between endorser and endorsee are often prosaic: they tend to share agents, or drink from the same bottle of warm Soave at some West End book launch. The trendy debut novel White Teeth by Zadie Smith, for instance, includes a cover quotation from Salman Rushdie, who is represented by the same firm of literary agents. Lucky woman. </p> <p>Or is she? Does it help a twentysomething literary hipster to be endorsed by some (admittedly Booker-winning, fatwa-enduring) old git, God bless him?

It sanctifies his achievement while seeming to celebrate hers. </p> <p>There is a cost to this cosy celebrity endorsement nonetheless. Many readers are sceptical about the worth of an author's quote on the dust jacket. In literary London, after all, there are rarely three, let alone six degrees of separation between reviewer and reviewed, still fewer between author and endorser. Jamie Holland, for instance, was the PR guy on Jamie Oliver's book The Naked Chef. When Holland's novel One Thing Leads to Another came out recently, it contained this endorsement from Oliver: \"An absolute cracker, a great book about mates, marriage and mating.\" </p> <p>It must have been difficult for the publishers to decide whether this endorsement would reek of literary incestuousness, or whether, given the Naked Chef's success and (putative) hipness, it would be a good idea. </p> <p> But when book editors and marketing departments are thrown back on their own verbal ingenuity, there are sometimes delightfully barmy consequences. Consider The Colour of Hope, the novel by Susan Madison to be published by Bantam Press in June. Apart from the 12-copy dumpbins, the streamers, the backdrop posters, the nationwide press campaign that will reach more than 9.5m people and giant cross-track advertising nationwide (hype which makes me want to go to Kazakhstan and live a life of silent contemplation), is the blurb on the front cover: </p> <p>\"All her life, she had feared death by water. </p> <p>All her life, she had imagined the death would be her own. . .\" </p> <p>Then the killer, though frankly unsourced, cover line: </p> <p>\"Magnificent. Heart-rending. Unforgettable. Out now wherever books are sold.\" </p> <p>I raise my hat to the people at Bantam Press for their devotion to plain speaking. Why bother relying on some flaky author to come up with a quote when you can push potential readers' buttons by alluding to books that they may have loved in the past? And so it is with the blurb for The Colour of Hope, which continues thus: \"For all those who loved The Horse Whisperer and [The] Bridges of Madison County.\" </p> <p>This multiple button pushing is understandable when the reading public is fractured into only occasionally overlapping interest groups. At the same time, it may well mark the insecurity of publishers: it is a kind of carpet bombing which is unlikely, by definition, to miss its target.

A Heart of Stone by Renate Dorrestein.\" </p> <p>No matter at all that there is no such tradition - that, rather, the yanking together of these two famous novelists' names will serve only to suggest, perhaps, that Dorrestein's novel is perhaps as kinky as McEwan and Dunmore can sometimes be. If you can read, there will be no way you can miss Madison's book, as the PR campaign schedule explains: \"Rights sold in 12 countries to date, including US.

      "bodyText": "A feature film version of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has been in development hell for almost 20 years. Austin Powers director Jay Roach has been attached to the project for more than a year now, but there's been little official news beyond that. Film insider gossip website Coming Attractions reports today that things are moving at last. An anonymous source close to the production has sent in two pictures, one of the prototype design for Marvin the Paranoid Android and another of the prototype version of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. \"The script is pretty much done, but Douglas keeps making changes,\" the apparently trustworthy source adds. \"I can say that the scene from the radio show where Zaphod goes to the Guide's offices will be in there and will resemble that bit out of Men in Black in the alien airport thing. (Although it won't suck!)\"",

The Miami relatives said they were outraged by an INS threat to revoke Elian's immigrant status if the undertaking was not signed, paving the way for his repatriation - a threat which provoked street protests in Miami and threats of civil disobedience from local officials.</p> <p>Alex Penelas, the mayor of Miami-Dade county, said: \"We will not lend our respective resources, whether they be in the form of police officers or any other resources, to assist the federal government in any way, shape or form.\"</p> <p>Mr Penelas said Ms Reno would be responsible for any unrest resulting from attempts to repatriate Elian. He was backed up by Joe Carollo, the Miami city mayor, who claimed that federal agents were making secret plans to seize Elian.</p> <p>In an attempt to defuse the tension, the INS deadline for compliance from the Miami relatives was pushed back 24 hours to 9am this morning, and the attorney general called for restraint.</p> <p>Ms Reno said: \"This case has been heartbreaking for everyone involved but we believe the law is clear.</p> <p>\"The father must speak for the little boy, because the sacred bond between parent and child must be recognised and honoured.\"</p> <p>Elian was shipwrecked when the small boat carrying illegal immigrants sank off the Cuban coast.

      "bodyText": "The US attorney general, Janet Reno, appealed for calm and respect for the rule of law yesterday after Miami municipal authorities threatened to stage a mutiny if the government tried to repatriate Elian Gonzalez, the six-year-old Cuban boy shipwrecked off Florida in November. The US Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INS) was yesterday holding negotiations with lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives to avert a street confrontation over the boy's fate. At issue was an undertaking the INS wanted the relatives to sign, in which they would promise to hand Elian over to his Cuban father and forego further appeals if a court case due in May goes against them. On Wednesday, Fidel Castro said that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, would be permitted to travel to the US for the proceedings, once Washington guaranteed the boy's return. \"The passports are ready,\" President Castro said in Havana. An entourage of relatives, teachers and psychiatrists to help Elian to \"re-adapt\" to Cuba has also been granted permission to travel but it is unclear whether they will get US visas. The Clinton administration has found itself entangled in the politically damaging custody battle. The Miami relatives said they were outraged by an INS threat to revoke Elian's immigrant status if the undertaking was not signed, paving the way for his repatriation - a threat which provoked street protests in Miami and threats of civil disobedience from local officials. Alex Penelas, the mayor of Miami-Dade county, said: \"We will not lend our respective resources, whether they be in the form of police officers or any other resources, to assist the federal government in any way, shape or form.\" Mr Penelas said Ms Reno would be responsible for any unrest resulting from attempts to repatriate Elian. He was backed up by Joe Carollo, the Miami city mayor, who claimed that federal agents were making secret plans to seize Elian. In an attempt to defuse the tension, the INS deadline for compliance from the Miami relatives was pushed back 24 hours to 9am this morning, and the attorney general called for restraint. Ms Reno said: \"This case has been heartbreaking for everyone involved but we believe the law is clear. \"The father must speak for the little boy, because the sacred bond between parent and child must be recognised and honoured.\" Elian was shipwrecked when the small boat carrying illegal immigrants sank off the Cuban coast. Elian's mother and 10 others drowned, but Elian survived by clinging to a car inner tube. He was found unconscious by Florida fishermen. The battle of wills over Elian's future has become a cold war throwback, providing a rallying cry for rightwing Miami Cuban exiles in their long struggle against the communist government in Havana. Elian's great uncle in Miami, Lazaro Gonzalez, had said he would hand the boy over if his father came to the US to collect them. But he has now toughened his stance. \"I won't cooperate in anything,\" he said. \"The boy lives in my house, and they'll have to go find him there.\" Elian-mania has been stoked by religious imagery in the Little Havana district of Miami where the boy has been staying. The boy has been compared to the infant Jesus and, as tensions have risen, local people claimed that they have spotted images of the Virgin Mary on the window of a local bank and on the mirror of Elian's bedroom.",

Not much hope then for those of us who think George Lucas peaked with American Graffiti in 1973. The original from this wearisome saga was accused of infantilising the movies, and by making this one not just a prequel but first among prequels, Lucas ensures that nothing grown-up can be allowed to intrude.</p> <p>Its battle scenes have clearly had millions chucked at them but, in this post-Matrix, post-Starship Troopers world, they seem like a quantum leap backwards, as if Lucas was deep-frozen in the 70s and has just been unthawed, Dark Star-style. His battles are cluttered and unfathomable, especially on the small screen. Jar Jar Binks, the vaunted new character, turns out to be Stouffer with a less convincing accent, an alligator snout and rabbity ears.</p> <p>You feel sorry for the film's heroic trio, who have to battle not only with the inevitable office lighting equipment but also with a script that is functional at best. Liam Neeson strides about looking mystic and Celtic in a Conneryish sort of way, Natalie Portman's princess intones her lines as if she's bored out of her mind, and Ewan McGregor, while eager to please, gets the worst lines of all of them, and has many galaxies to cross before he can become Alec Guinness. (\"Oh, don't worry. This hasn't been our day for warm welcomes\" sticks in the mind for sheer lameness.) And around all of it swirls a welter of soupy John Williams strings, wrapping all the pseudo-religious homilies in aural treacle.</p> <p>But what about the good bits? Well, I liked the architecture on Tattooine and, every now and then, you spot an actor who could give it some life. Look! There's Sam Jackson. It's Terence Stamp! But they drift by like asteroids on their way to somewhere better. It seems to be pitched at eight-year-olds but is far too long for them. And speaking of eight-year-olds...</p> <p><strong> South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut </strong><br>Retail (\u00a314.99) and DVD (\u00a319.99) <br>Warner Cert 15 <br> ***</p> <p>South Park's traditional $5 budget is upped to $24.95 for this relatively lavish and surprisingly coherent attack on American values. Cartman and co learn lots of new swear words by sneaking into a film by adult comedians, launching an orgy of censorship among their elders. \"Horrific depictions of violence are OK as long as no one says naughty words,\" as Kyle's mother puts it.</p> <p>The backlash includes a topical (for the UK) Clockwork Orange-style v-chip which electrocutes Cartman whenever he swears. It's as self-reflexive as a Scream movie and as scatalogically obsessed as ever (399 profane words, 128 offensive gestures and 221 acts of violence, according to a useful press release). More shockingly, there's some half-decent animation in a sub-plot set in hell, which Satan shares with Saddam Hussein. Other highlights: Minnie Driver as Brooke Shields, Winona Ryder's ping-pong ball trick, and the death of Bill Gates. Oh, and they kill Kenny.</p> <p><strong> Pocahontas II </strong><br>Retail and DVD (\u00a315.99) <br>Buena Vista Cert U <br> **</p> <p>From the opposite end of Toontown, Disney's follow-up to Pocahontas is released directly to video. Pocahontas is Mulan's twin, a heroine feisty and feminist but still cute enough for the catwalk. Actually, she's a dead ringer for Barbara Carrera, circa 1974.</p> <p>Pocahontas has quite a nice line in put-downs and a Hugh Grantish Englishman to use them on. Before long, they sail to England on a peace mission, where she attends the hunt ball, the film gets to put the boot into snobbery and racism, and the illustrators get to show off strong compositions and colours and a flair for action sequences. There's a song every 10 minutes and if you don't mind the relentless prettification, it's an enjoyable watch with little ones. Disney is also lobbing seven of its back catalogue, including The Jungle Book, 101 Dalmatians and Lady and the Tramp on to DVD at \u00a319.99.</p>",

You feel sorry for the film's heroic trio, who have to battle not only with the inevitable office lighting equipment but also with a script that is functional at best. Liam Neeson strides about looking mystic and Celtic in a Conneryish sort of way, Natalie Portman's princess intones her lines as if she's bored out of her mind, and Ewan McGregor, while eager to please, gets the worst lines of all of them, and has many galaxies to cross before he can become Alec Guinness. (\"Oh, don't worry. This hasn't been our day for warm welcomes\" sticks in the mind for sheer lameness.) And around all of it swirls a welter of soupy John Williams strings, wrapping all the pseudo-religious homilies in aural treacle. But what about the good bits? Well, I liked the architecture on Tattooine and, every now and then, you spot an actor who could give it some life. Look! There's Sam Jackson. It's Terence Stamp! But they drift by like asteroids on their way to somewhere better. It seems to be pitched at eight-year-olds but is far too long for them. And speaking of eight-year-olds... South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut Retail (\u00a314.99) and DVD (\u00a319.99) Warner Cert 15 *** South Park's traditional $5 budget is upped to $24.95 for this relatively lavish and surprisingly coherent attack on American values. Cartman and co learn lots of new swear words by sneaking into a film by adult comedians, launching an orgy of censorship among their elders. \"Horrific depictions of violence are OK as long as no one says naughty words,\" as Kyle's mother puts it. The backlash includes a topical (for the UK) Clockwork Orange-style v-chip which electrocutes Cartman whenever he swears. It's as self-reflexive as a Scream movie and as scatalogically obsessed as ever (399 profane words, 128 offensive gestures and 221 acts of violence, according to a useful press release). More shockingly, there's some half-decent animation in a sub-plot set in hell, which Satan shares with Saddam Hussein. Other highlights: Minnie Driver as Brooke Shields, Winona Ryder's ping-pong ball trick, and the death of Bill Gates. Oh, and they kill Kenny. Pocahontas II Retail and DVD (\u00a315.99) Buena Vista Cert U ** From the opposite end of Toontown, Disney's follow-up to Pocahontas is released directly to video. Pocahontas is Mulan's twin, a heroine feisty and feminist but still cute enough for the catwalk. Actually, she's a dead ringer for Barbara Carrera, circa 1974. Pocahontas has quite a nice line in put-downs and a Hugh Grantish Englishman to use them on. Before long, they sail to England on a peace mission, where she attends the hunt ball, the film gets to put the boot into snobbery and racism, and the illustrators get to show off strong compositions and colours and a flair for action sequences. There's a song every 10 minutes and if you don't mind the relentless prettification, it's an enjoyable watch with little ones. Disney is also lobbing seven of its back catalogue, including The Jungle Book, 101 Dalmatians and Lady and the Tramp on to DVD at \u00a319.99.",

But when American football comes up, an iron curtain of alienation comes down.</p> <p>The US shrugs at the rest of the world by treating soccer as a game for children, but its passion for football really is a religion - a cold, puritanical religion at that, with its joyless emphasis on work and rigid military strategies.</p> <p>One of the most extraordinary scenes in Any Given Sunday, Oliver Stone's chest-beating epic about the national game, is when the testosterone-enriched giants of the Miami Sharks, dazed with Demerol and confused with cortisone, huddle in the changing room in a team prayer, presided over by their official Christian padre.</p> <p>It's not ironic; nor does it betoken any particularly transcendental insight. (If there are any Muslims on the team, they kneel obediently with the rest.) And it's after the game, so there's no secular motive for revving up the troops. This solemnity is of a piece with the rest of the picture - a film which promises us a tough, searching look at the fanatical world of pro football, but which inevitably ends up bowing the knee to this unsmiling, parochial obsession. </p> <p>Al Pacino once again does a lot of expressionless shouting as Tony D'Amato, the ageing, has-been coach. This time he does it from the sidelines, wearing a mike headset. He's tough on the players. He's tough on himself. But he's on the skids, and that's tough. </p> <p>The Miami Sharks have been losing game after game, and their owner - a friend and protector of Tony's - has died, bequeathing them to his beautiful, ruthless business-minded daughter Christina (Cameron Diaz). Of course, all she cares about is money, and she has no feeling for the \"purity\" of the game. </p> <p>Christina imperiously insists on visiting the steamy locker-room to make a kind of congratulatory royal progress while her big black gladiators are in a state of undress. There is a real frisson of sex, power and money as she coolly approaches her stars before they have had a chance to cover their manhood. And the crunch comes when the superstar new quarterback \"Steamin\" Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) starts hitting on her.</p> <p>Beamen is the crux of the picture, and Stone has his finest moment with a brilliant sequence with a kind of montage-riff taking off from the rap video Willie has made for his multi-million dollar high-energy drink endorsement deal. And there is something very sleek and sexy about the players dehumanising themselves into robo-warriors. Many is the crunch, the clench, the creak of ruined tendon, the snap of bone: and even an eye torn out and left on the Astroturf. There are three or four or five shots of the spinning, floating, torpedo ball.</p> <p>In anyone else's hands, this might look like displacement activity for suppressed sexual violence or martial aggression. In End Zone, novelist Don DeLillo found in it a metaphor for the nuclear strike, and in Tom Wolfe's A Man In Full, the superstar running back Fareek \"The Cannon\" Fanon is the locus of all sorts of political tensions. But, ultimately, Stone is just intoxicated with football for itself, the harsh power and slo-mo poetry of stegosaurus-proportioned men and their contest for glory. </p> <p>This makes for exhilarating cinema at first - but this is a long film, and non-football fans are entitled to ask if there is anything more to it than The Game. Stone peppers his football sequences with black-and-white fragments and snatched memories of games and players past. In JFK or Nixon, this technique disturbingly demonstrated a secret history, a sense of hidden fracture and violation in the past. Here, however, it is just dewy-eyed ancestor worship and an invocation of the great tradition of football.</p> <p>The racial tensions are resolved pretty painlessly; Beamen gives the white paternalist coach some fierce attitude at the beginning of the picture, but ends up sentimentally endorsing his authority, and there's no question of ever actually getting it on with the nordic Cameron. </p> <p>The Miami Sharks also have another cliche on the team: the sinister, cynical physician Dr Mandrake (James Woods), who unscrupulously feeds the guys medicines to keep them going at all costs - even though it means risking their health. </p> <p>Stone takes it all in with a great panoramic sweep; coyly awarding himself a (pretty big) cameo as a TV commentator whooping and punching the air at what's happening on the field - thus sending a pretty unsubtle message about how he regards it, and how we ought to regard it too. </p> <p>It's a film which suggests you might win or lose on any given Sunday - but can you win or lose like a man, a mensch, an hombre? The win-at-all-costs mentality is criticised. But there's no prizes for guessing how the last game of the film ends. Much of this is muscular, exciting film-making but, in the end, it's for fans only.</p>",

There is a real frisson of sex, power and money as she coolly approaches her stars before they have had a chance to cover their manhood. And the crunch comes when the superstar new quarterback \"Steamin\" Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) starts hitting on her. Beamen is the crux of the picture, and Stone has his finest moment with a brilliant sequence with a kind of montage-riff taking off from the rap video Willie has made for his multi-million dollar high-energy drink endorsement deal. And there is something very sleek and sexy about the players dehumanising themselves into robo-warriors. Many is the crunch, the clench, the creak of ruined tendon, the snap of bone: and even an eye torn out and left on the Astroturf. There are three or four or five shots of the spinning, floating, torpedo ball. In anyone else's hands, this might look like displacement activity for suppressed sexual violence or martial aggression. In End Zone, novelist Don DeLillo found in it a metaphor for the nuclear strike, and in Tom Wolfe's A Man In Full, the superstar running back Fareek \"The Cannon\" Fanon is the locus of all sorts of political tensions. But, ultimately, Stone is just intoxicated with football for itself, the harsh power and slo-mo poetry of stegosaurus-proportioned men and their contest for glory. This makes for exhilarating cinema at first - but this is a long film, and non-football fans are entitled to ask if there is anything more to it than The Game. Stone peppers his football sequences with black-and-white fragments and snatched memories of games and players past. In JFK or Nixon, this technique disturbingly demonstrated a secret history, a sense of hidden fracture and violation in the past. Here, however, it is just dewy-eyed ancestor worship and an invocation of the great tradition of football. The racial tensions are resolved pretty painlessly; Beamen gives the white paternalist coach some fierce attitude at the beginning of the picture, but ends up sentimentally endorsing his authority, and there's no question of ever actually getting it on with the nordic Cameron. The Miami Sharks also have another cliche on the team: the sinister, cynical physician Dr Mandrake (James Woods), who unscrupulously feeds the guys medicines to keep them going at all costs - even though it means risking their health. Stone takes it all in with a great panoramic sweep; coyly awarding himself a (pretty big) cameo as a TV commentator whooping and punching the air at what's happening on the field - thus sending a pretty unsubtle message about how he regards it, and how we ought to regard it too. It's a film which suggests you might win or lose on any given Sunday - but can you win or lose like a man, a mensch, an hombre? The win-at-all-costs mentality is criticised. But there's no prizes for guessing how the last game of the film ends. Much of this is muscular, exciting film-making but, in the end, it's for fans only.",

      "body": "<p>What goes around comes around. Back in the mid-80s, Jim Jarmusch was the last word in cinema chic, the coolest kid on the independent-movie block. Sixteen years and seven feature films later, Jarmusch stands as the last of a dying breed, defender of the purist faith. Jarmusch himself hasn't changed; his new film, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai is packed with the genre tricks and mordant humour that have characterised all his output. But after drifting, unloved and unappreciated, in a cinematic limbo for most of the 90s, the world has started, once again, seeing things Jarmusch's way. </p> <p>His appearance only adds to the effect. Now 47, Jarmusch is practically identical to the Ohio-born, NYU-educated hipster who used his $12,000 film school scholarship money to make his first low-budget feature, Permanent Vacation. His second, Stranger Than Paradise, cost even less.</p> <p>Jarmusch's trademark upswept silver hairdo is perfectly in place; keen eyes ever eager to communicate some heartfelt idea; slow voice measuring out the words. \"One thing that flipped me out,\" he says, \"when we made Stranger, we were very conscious that it was 1982. Though it was post punk, style was still very rock'n'roll. We lived in that milieu in New York, but we wanted characters who weren't connected with that. We wanted them to look more like guys you'd see at the racetrack. And then two years later everyone started dressing like that. It's funny how things happen.\" </p> <p>Funny, indeed. Between 1984 and 1989, Jarmusch spearheaded the independent film movement, alongside Spike Lee and Michael Moore, with a trilogy of perfectly executed, thoroughly individual films. Stranger Than Paradise, Down By Law, and Mystery Train all shared a three-part structure, a wistful nostalgia for American pulp culture, and a downbeat, low-key narrative style borrowed from European and Japanese models. Jarmusch - in contrast to Lee's playful promotion of African-American consciousness, and Moore's self-help political radicalism - definitely occupied the high end of 80s alternative film-making, purveyor of an unflappable existential world-weariness that heralded the rise of a new wave of American auteurism. </p> <p>These days, however, Jarmusch is reluctant to dwell on past glories. \"I don't look back,\" he says. \"Especially not at my own work. I don't know why. It's not healthy for me. Looking back, in work and in life, is something I'm hesitant to do. I try not to. It's funny, though, I'm transferring all my films to digital masters, for future DVD release, and it's really excruciating for me to watch them again. Down By Law, or whatever. I leave really depressed.\" </p> <p>Jarmusch began the 90s with Night on Earth, his most ambitious film to date, boasting a pedigree cast that included Winona Ryder and Gena Rowlands, and a tricky five-city schedule. Despite Night on Earth, however, Jarmusch's career stubbornly refused to take off - unlike Lee, who was gearing up to make Malcolm X for Columbia. \"My films are hand-made in the garage,\" says Jarmusch, \"so it takes me a little while to get them together. My friend Aki Kaurismaki calls me the world's slowest film director, after Kubrick. My rhythm is my rhythm, and - how can I say this? - I'm not ambitious, and I'm not career-orientated in that way. If I were, I'd make different kinds of films. I'm lucky and happy and want to keep making work, but I have no desire to be more prolific.\" </p> <p>\"But then I see someone like Aki, who works in the same way, or Claire Denis. They make films more often than I do. But I'm always telling them to slow down. I want them to be happy and healthy; they worry me because they get stressed out by working too much. I'm happy with my rhythm, slow as it may be. It's how I talk.\" </p> <p>It... sure... is..., Jim... Jarmusch, however, has suffered in other ways. As Night on Earth ambled into cinemas worldwide, another force was gathering the momentum that was to end up eclipsing Jarmusch's gentle, cosmopolitan tale-spinning. Quentin Tarantino's early oeuvre trod the same paths as Jarmusch through cinematic self-reference, the poetry of street talk, and loose jigsaw-like structures - but also offered a souped-up pace and a massive injection of blood-letting.</p> <p>Even more galling are the string of direct replays: the ghost of Elvis that appeared in True Romance popped up in Mystery Train, as does Four Rooms' hotel-bellboy linking device. Suddenly Jarmusch's slouching pulp fictions stopped seeming half as exciting when Tarantino's thrill-rides hit the screen. </p> <p>\"Quentin,\" mumbles Jarmusch, with characteristic generosity. \"I like his films. But look, in the 70s I was into Jim Thompson and Charles Willeford and all that, and we used to argue with academics about it. No one was interested. You can't tell us that Jim Thompson is less important than Dante; you can't tell us that Gustav Mahler's music is more important than the Ramones. Now I find myself in the same argument, but on the other side, don't tell us Jim Thompson's more important than Dante, like don't buy into that hierarchical bullshit. We're arguing about the same things, but the polarity's reversed.\" </p> <p>The mid-90s were Jarmusch's lowest ebb, a seemingly redundant film-maker tossed aside by fickle fashion. He kept himself busy appearing in friends' pet projects - a documentary on Sam Fuller's unfinished film Tigrero, a cameo in Wayne Wang's impro-happening Blue in the Face - and adding to Cigarettes and Coffee, his personal short film cycle. Then he embarked on Dead Man, a long mulled-over western - which resulted in a dangerous clash with Miramax chairman Harvey Weinstein. </p> <p>Jarmusch protests his misfortune in an amiable, level-headed manner. \"I felt that Miramax did not keep their word to me. I'm not bitter, and I did not expect Dead Man to be a commercial success. But I wanted it handled in a classy way. And it was handled, as one critic put it, with tongs by Miramax. I don't want to go into the whole thing, but Harvey Weinstein and I had problems with each other about him keeping his word to me. Because he bought a finished film; and then wanted me to change it. This was insulting to me and, ultimately, I felt punished - because I didn't do what he wanted, he didn't distribute the film in a classy way. But that's all business: I don't hate Harvey Weinstein. I just approach the world with a different code than he does.\" </p> <p>If this sounds a little samurai, then it will be no surprise to learn that Jarmusch's longtime affection for Japanese culture in general, and cinema in particular, underpins Ghost Dog. Though it mixes in elements from hip hop movies and the mafia genre, Ghost Dog's central conceit is that Forest Whitaker - another Jarmusch pal - is a ghetto assassin who loves to read from the Hagakure, the 18th century collection of meditations on Bushido (the \"code of the warrior\").</p> <p>Jarmusch's Japanese orientation stretches way back: at the outset of his career, he was plugging his interest in classical masters like Kurosawa and Ozu; Mystery Train gave Japanese star Masatoshi Nagase his first break in movies; and the same film saw the commencement of Jarmusch's financial relationship with JVC Entertainment, (which also injected funds into Night on Earth and Ghost Dog). </p> <p>Moreover, Jarmusch has attached a list of \"personal thanks\" to Ghost Dog's end credits. Along with Jean-Pierre Melville (Le Samourai), Mary Shelley, the Wu Tang Clan and Miguel de Cervantes are Akira Kurosawa and, most intriguingly, Seijun Suzuki, Japan's maverick master gangster-movie director.</p> <p>\"I got to meet him a few weeks ago, in Tokyo,\" says Jarmusch, getting almost excited as he recalls an encounter with one of his idols. \"Spent a whole evening talking to him. He's amazing, almost like a Japanese Sam Fuller; not the same aesthetic, but old school. At first he was very nice and polite about Ghost Dog; then he had a few drinks, and I asked him, tell me what you don't like, and he did. It was great; it was so interesting. He said, I like the atmosphere very much, it takes him too long to go and kill everyone. I would get him there, kill 'em all, I don't have time for all this. They want the tension of a more classical story. And then he had a long thing about people dying in the street. This is a bad place to die - where you die is as important as when and how you die. So I said, in American ghetto culture the street is not negative. He wants to make a new film too. I'm trying to get JVC to help him.\" </p> <p>Here, you sense, is the answer to the riddle as to how Jarmusch has made it through the bad times - he likes people, and people like him. No other film-maker appears so dedicated to the art of simply hanging out, of making friends wherever he goes. Equally at ease with Hollywood veterans like Fuller (\"I wish Sam was still alive,\" he says sadly), as music industry players like Wu Tang's RZA (who provided all of Ghost Dog's original soundtrack), Jarmusch has always surrounded himself with friends who double as collaborators, and vice versa. Roberto Benigni, Kaurismaki, Wim Wenders, Beatrice Dalle, Neil Young... these are just a few of the names in Jarmusch's gilt-edged Rolodex, a web of acquaintance that spans the globe. </p> <p>His breakthrough movie, Stranger Than Paradise, culled its stars (John Lurie, Richard Edson) from Jarmusch's dabblings in New York's late-70s art-rock scene; Ghost Dog, his latest, is merely continuing the trend. Despite the fact that Jarmusch's work instantaneously became the pet subject of graduate theses, he's as keen as ever to point up the collaborative nature of his film-making.</p> <p>\"To me, the auteur thing is a lot of bullshit, because you collaborate on a film in every way, with everyone - even with whoever's stopping traffic. But I'm contradictory, because I'm a control freak to the point that I want to know every prop, every ashtray, every colour, everything that's in the set. But at the same time I'm collaborating with other people, who are helping me find those things. I would like to work in a more free way, but I don't have that luxury because I don't have that kind of budget.\" </p> <p>If nothing else, Jarmusch's long run demonstrates that you get what you give, that the love you take is equal to the love you make, that - indeed - what goes around comes around. And it's just as well he's content with his lot. \"I don't want to be mainstream,\" he says. \"I like being in the margins. I'm happy where I exist. The things that inspire me I find in the margins. I'm not consciously trying to be marginal, it's just where I end up and where I live. There's a gift in there for me and I'm happy to have that gift.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai opens on April 28.</p>",

Ms Conran, who famously declared that \"Life is too short to stuff a mushroom\" in her bestseller Superwoman, said it was time to put an end to the damaging long hours culture, in which achievement is measured in terms of employees' presence in the office - \"presenteeism\" - rather than their output. \"The long hours culture threatens the health of everyone who practises it, and it has a domino effect on their families,\" she said. \"One in five British children has a stress-related health problem.

Her reaction, he wrote, was entirely appropriate. Nuclear weapons are so inherently absurd that rational argument about their use is scarcely possible. </p> <p>In these matters, instinct is often the best guide. Reasonable discourse can lead in dangerous directions: each step may appear reasonable, and yet the whole sequence be the reverse of reasonable. This is the context in which it can be said that some of the arguments about deploying a limited missile defence system in the US are not unreasonable, and some of the arguments against are not particularly strong. Yet, even though this is so, the ultimate effect of deployment could well be profoundly damaging to the security of all countries, including America. </p> <p>Britain's agreement in principle to changes at the Fylingdales early warning station that prepare the way for this deployment, as reported in the Guardian yesterday, was probably inevitable. In defence matters, the government strives alternately to satisfy both the EU and the US. One for Europe was represented by Tony Blair's recent decision in favour of a European air-to-air missile. One for the US is represented by this potential adjustment at Fylingdales. No doubt the government reserves its position on the much more critical changes that would come later, if the station was to be refurbished to deal with alleged threats from the Middle East as well as from North Korea. </p> <p>At that moment Britain would be vulnerable to missiles which the US, thanks in part to early warning from Yorkshire, would be able to shoot down. That is, if there are genuine threats; if America's huge array of nuclear weapons were not sufficient to deter them; if a \"rogue state\" did then target Britain; if the American missile defences actually worked. These \"ifs\" are a measure of how the rational and the irrational are so riskily muddled in these arguments. </p> <p>Britain, of course, is only a detail in the big picture. At the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London last week an American and a Russian debated the broader issues. The Russian expert on American affairs, Sergei Rogov, arguing that deployment would be destabilising, was reasonable. The former American diplomat and aide to Ronald Reagan, Arnold Kanter, arguing that it need not be, was also reasonable. </p> <p>It was possible to imagine these two men, or men like them, arriving at a Russo-American agreement under which America would get its anti-missile system and Russia would get a more favourable nuclear balance, at much lower levels on both sides, with the US. It is possible, too, that China could be reassured and Europe's doubts overcome, particularly if Russia drops its objections. In fact this is now the thrust of moderate, informed opinion in the US. Since national missile defence has become inevitable, says this school of thought, the key objective should be to lodge it in a series of agreements and understandings with other countries. At the end of the process the US, Russia, and Europe might all congenially share an interconnected set of anti-missile defences. </p> <p> Yet all this reasonableness conceals the real force behind the drive for new missile defences. That force is an angry American nationalism which sees the rest of the world as suspect and potentially malign, and makes a fetish of nuclear weapons. It also clings to the idea that America's superior technology can give it invulnerability while allowing it to intervene forcibly around the world whenever it wishes to do so. </p> <p>This is summed up in a phrase quoted by Rogov: \"Freedom to attack, and freedom from attack.\" It may not be the nationalism of most Americans, but it is the nationalism of a section of the Republican party, and it has outposts elsewhere. Ordinary Americans, the polls show, favour arms control. But naturally, when asked whether the country should defend itself, they tend to favour that as well. </p> <p>It is the job of serious politicians to explain that some forms of defence can reduce rather than increase security. But there are many in America who do the opposite. After the Senate voted to reject the Test Ban Treaty, majority leader Trent Lott deemed that the next objective should be to \"strengthen American nuclear deterrence\". This in a country with the capacity to blow up the world many times over. </p> <p>In the face of such attitudes, the facts matter little. North Korea could peaceably unite with South Korea, Saddam Hussein could fall, Iran could abandon its weapons programmes - men like these would soon find fresh demons. Representatives of the people of this calibre might well reject an amended ABM Treaty with Russia, one crafted to secure Russian agreement to new US anti-missile deployment, because they would prefer that treaty to collapse altogether. </p> <p>Let it be admitted that, at some point in the future, it might be easier for the US and its allies to deal with a hostile country that had a handful of unsophisticated nuclear weapons if there was little chance that those weapons would get through. But look at the price to be paid for that notional capacity in that notional situation. It is a large one, even if the moderates succeed in bringing it in with some measure of international agreement. The price is that the idea of controlling, reducing and ultimately taking nuclear weapons to as close to vanishing point as possible is slipping off the American and therefore the international agenda. </p> <p>That changes the atmosphere in which other states will make decisions, as it already has in the sub- continent. It points to a future in which the advanced states will keep their weapons and more of the poorer states will acquire them. Not necessarily a large number. As Martin van Creveld implies, nuclear weapons are stupid things to have and, whatever seemed to be the case 40 or 50 years ago, when most of the present owners acquired them, many countries now are smart enough not to want them. </p> <p>But it might not take many to contrive a disaster, particularly in a world where America had made the wrong choice, as William Pfaff has put it, between \"international balance and accommodation... and... global preponderance and hegemony.\" Even if a nuclear exchange continues to be avoided - and it may be - this is still not a world in which it is going to be pleasant to live.

Though the petrol situation was easier, commuters had seen five-hour queues rewarded with five-litre rations; lorries and commuter buses had to wait six hours for diesel.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Zimbabwean government continued to pile the blame for the problems on to Britain, with an attack on the Foreign Office minister Peter Hain by Zimbabwe's information minister, Chen Chimutengwende, who accused him of acting as though he were \"governor of Rhodesia\".</p> <p>With elections only weeks away that may lead to President Robert Mugabe losing power after 20 years, clashes are erupting throughout the country between supporters of the ruling Zanu-PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).</p> <p>A teenage MDC supporter died in the Mvurwi area of northern Zimbabwe on Tuesday, two days after being stoned by Zanu-PF members. He was on the back of a lorry taking people to a rally.</p> <p>In a separate incident, two white visitors from South Africa were seriously beaten by a gang identified as Zanu-PF supporters; one is in a coma and has been airlifted to South Africa for treatment.</p> <p>The two visitors were assaulted in the central city of Kwekwe on Tuesday night. Their attackers had apparently decided to assault some whitepeople to demonstrate their support for Mr Mugabe. Police have arrested 14 people in connection with the beatings.</p> <p>The number of properties invaded by veterans of the war against Rhodesian rule rose to 800 yesterday, well over 20% of the country's commercial farms. A number of people have been beaten by the squatters but, on Mr Mugabe's orders, the police have failed to take any action.</p> <p>The farm invasions were led by Chenjerai \"Hitler\" Hunzvi, who has threatened to take the country to war if the opposition wins the parliamentary elections.

      "bodyText": "The political crisis in Zimbabwe worsened yesterday as more white-owned farms came under occupation from war veterans and the first reports came through that the confrontation was turning more violent. In Harare, city workers remained on strike for a fourth successive day, leaving water supplies either cut off or undrinkable. Though the petrol situation was easier, commuters had seen five-hour queues rewarded with five-litre rations; lorries and commuter buses had to wait six hours for diesel. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwean government continued to pile the blame for the problems on to Britain, with an attack on the Foreign Office minister Peter Hain by Zimbabwe's information minister, Chen Chimutengwende, who accused him of acting as though he were \"governor of Rhodesia\". With elections only weeks away that may lead to President Robert Mugabe losing power after 20 years, clashes are erupting throughout the country between supporters of the ruling Zanu-PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). A teenage MDC supporter died in the Mvurwi area of northern Zimbabwe on Tuesday, two days after being stoned by Zanu-PF members. He was on the back of a lorry taking people to a rally. In a separate incident, two white visitors from South Africa were seriously beaten by a gang identified as Zanu-PF supporters; one is in a coma and has been airlifted to South Africa for treatment. The two visitors were assaulted in the central city of Kwekwe on Tuesday night. Their attackers had apparently decided to assault some whitepeople to demonstrate their support for Mr Mugabe. Police have arrested 14 people in connection with the beatings. The number of properties invaded by veterans of the war against Rhodesian rule rose to 800 yesterday, well over 20% of the country's commercial farms. A number of people have been beaten by the squatters but, on Mr Mugabe's orders, the police have failed to take any action. The farm invasions were led by Chenjerai \"Hitler\" Hunzvi, who has threatened to take the country to war if the opposition wins the parliamentary elections. Mr Hunzvi has received backing from Mr Mugabe. On Wednesday, Mr Hunzvi led a group of 70 to the farm of professional hunter Richard Pascal. Claiming that Mr Pascal was running a \"training camp\" for MDC supporters, Mr Hunzvi and his gang broke down the locked gate, beat up a young black visitor, took Mr Pascal's handgun and stormed into his house. The group seized 11 guns and other weapons from Mr Pascal before leaving the property. The weapons, all legally registered, are being held by police. The bewildering dispute between Britain and Zimbabwe continued with the attack from Mr Chimutengwende, who spent 12 years in Britain when Ian Smith's illegal regime ruled Rhodesia, and worked as a freelance journalist (contributing once to the Guardian) and journalism lecturer. \"I used to vote Labour myself when I was there. But it was always the same. We were always disappointed,\" he said. \"The trouble with Labour is that they are so paternalistic. \"Mr Hain makes statements on any issue in Zimbabwe, whether it concerns Britain or not. He behaves as though he were governor of Rhodesia, and he is very emotional about it. I think he suffers from a colonial mentality.\" The minister said there was nothing fundamentally wrong with Anglo-Zimbabwean relations, and he declined to comment on Mr Mugabe's continuing claims that Britain was run by a government of gay gangsters. Some diplomatic sources suggest that, despite the insults, efforts are continuing at official levels to ease the tension, both between the governments and in the countryside. Even so, with the Zimbabwean government under siege from all directions, there is no sign yet that it is ready for a show of humility. Mr Chimutengwende said: \"The British should keep out of internal affairs and stop making statements about what is good for us and what is not good for us.\"",

      "body": "<p>Dr Ryuzo Yanagimachi, first master of the young science of cloning mice, has produced 200 of the little creatures in his laboratory in the idyllic setting of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. Now he would like to try his hand at something larger. It's warm in Hawaii. But not too warm, perhaps, for a mammoth. </p> <p>Yanagimachi and his colleague Teruhiko Wakayama belong to one of several research teams around the world that have applied to the academic guardians of a frozen mammoth carcass, recently sawn out of the Siberian permafrost, for a sample of the extinct creature's cells. They want to examine the cells' core of genes to see if they have survived intact after tens of thousands of years in deep freeze. If the DNA looks OK, well, why not acquire elephant eggs, hollow them out, put the ancient genes inside, insert the fertilised egg into an elephant and wait 22 months for the birth of a cloned mammoth? \"Why do it? Scientific curiosity,\" says Yanagimachi. \"Also, if you can do it with a mammoth, maybe you can save many extinct species. It's a challenge for me.\" </p> <p>On the face of it, to jump from cloning mice to mammoths in such a short time shows how far and how fast the field of cloning has moved since February 1997 when the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first mammal cloned from an adult cell, was announced to the world. </p> <p>The truth is that the pace of change has been dictated by the shock of the revolution Dolly represented. Reproductive biologists had been convinced that cloning could not be done. Now they are racing to make up for lost time. \"What we really believed, deep in our hearts, was that this was one biological feat we could never master,\" confessed the Princeton biologist Lee Silver in his book, Remaking Eden. \"It was impossible, we thought, for a cell from an adult mammal to become reprogrammed.\" </p> <p>So many different species have now been successfully cloned, with new ones reported almost every quarter - rabbits are rumoured to be next - that society, at first stunned then dismayed by the concept of cloning, seems to have become almost blas\u00e9 at the notion of identical animals conceived without sex. The public uproar over genetically modified foods and irradiated foods has masked the fact that we are capable of shrugging our shoulders over equally radical interventions in nature, such as the international frozen bull semen trade or the extreme breeding techniques which have given us giant, flavourless Californian strawberries. </p> <p> Yet the greatest cause of unease, the idea of cloning human beings, while it may have receded, remains to be rekindled. Cloning researchers - many of whom have had to turn away grieving relatives seeking the rebirth of a dead child or dying partner - have made strenuous efforts to reassure the world that human cloning is neither necessary, easy nor right. </p> <p> The fourth truth they are reluctant to add is that the breadth of cloning experience acquired in other animals in the three years since Dolly was born, and the relative simplicity of the equipment required, makes human cloning more feasible today than ever. \"Things are calmer now,\" says Dr Harry Griffin, assistant director at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh where Dolly was born and still thrives. \"You can't maintain a heightened sense of fear about human cloning indefinitely. Scientists around the world who are involved in cloning have been uniformly outgoing in explaining the limitations of the technology, that success rates are very low, that there are differences in all species and that in no circumstances should people be experimenting on young women. </p> <p>\"I think that message has got through to some of those enthusiasts who think human cloning is just like in-vitro fertilisation and to those who don't understand that if you clone an adult human being you get a child. </p> <p>\"We have very low success rates, like one in 100. A woman going through IVF would generally provide 10 eggs. There's a bit of a shortfall there. Cloning is never going to be as effective as IVF. I'm sure none of the men who have shown an interest in human cloning have ever discussed it with their wives.\" </p> <p>Everyone knows Neil Armstrong. Few remember the second man on the moon. Soon after Dolly appeared, she was joined by Noto and Kaga, two calves cloned in Japan. They will be two in July; about 100 calves have been cloned since they were born. </p> <p>While much of the British research into cloning has focused on replicating transgenic animals - livestock genetically tweaked to produce vital human proteins in milk, or provide organs for human transplantation - Japanese researchers have been most aggressive in trying to get clones from the laboratory to the dinner plate. There was some consumer angst in Japan last year when it emerged that beef produced using an earlier, limited cloning technique - a bit like artificially provoking identical twins or triplets - had been on sale, unlabelled, since the mid-90s. The beef is now labelled, but the government argues that there is nothing to distinguish it from any other meat. It is not genetically modified; factually, if not philosophically, it is no more peculiar than a plant grown from a cutting, which is also a clone. </p> <p>The Roslin Institute reckons that if the international price of a cloned cow embryo could be brought down to around the $100 mark, 85% of herds could be clones eventually: identical copies of the best milkers, the best breeders and the meatiest beef cows. Researchers are now looking at the minimum number of \"originals\" required as sources for the clones in order to preserve a vestige of diversification in farm animals. </p> <p>In Hawaii, Yanagimachi's first cloned mouse, Cumulina, is two and a half years old - pensionable age. \"She's in pretty good shape,\" he says. Biotechnology researchers use mice by the truckload in experiments, and exact multiple copies of the same mouse would enable them to make precise comparisons of the effects of drugs and disease. The Honolulu team has improved the success rate of cloning: now one in 10, instead of the original one in 100, of its cloned embryos survives to birth. </p> <p>In early March, in a Virginia research centre run by the Scottish firm PPL Therapeutics, the first cloned pigs, Millie, Christa, Alexis, Carrel and Dotcom, were born. This major achievement paved the way to the start of organ farming for transplant into humans; the next step is to clone \"knockout\" pigs, which have a gene knocked out that would otherwise cause a human body to reject transplanted organs. </p> <p>Goats have been cloned in the US; horses, cats and dogs have yet to be cloned, but it seems only a matter of time. In Texas, an anonymous wealthy couple have invested $2.3 m (\u00a31.37m) in a research centre to clone their beloved dog, Missy. The project, Missyplicity, has a commercial offshoot, Genetic Savings and Clone, which offers to freeze and store genetic samples of any favourite animal against the day when they can be reliably and economically cloned. </p> <p>\"Regardless of whether the animal in your care is a champion bull, a rare white tiger, or a beloved mutt,\" announces the Missyplicity website, \"Genetic Savings and Clone is the safest place to store its DNA.\" </p> <p>Advances in cloning are not straightforward. The Dolly breakthrough was one of those moments in science which creates a mystery rather than solving one. Before Dolly, it was known that the genetic core of an embryonic cell - a cell from the first tiny cluster of cells which grows after conception - could be detached, inserted into a donor egg and used to create another embryo. Ian Wilmut and his Roslin team shattered biology dogma when they showed that the genetic material from a non-embryonic cell- a cell which had already settled into its specialised lifetime role, in the case of Dolly, forming part of an adult ewe's udder - could be inserted into a donor egg and reprogrammed by the egg to become an embryonic cell. How strange is this? As much as waking up to find find that your hand is turning into a foot or a tongue. </p> <p>The trouble is, nobody yet knows why the egg is capable of doing this. And while the technology for cloning may be relatively simple, the technique remains fiendishly hard, with a low success rate. At the Regional Primate Centre in Oregon, Don Wolf and his colleagues achieved early success four years ago with a simpler form of cloning than the Dolly method when they produced twin rhesus monkeys, Netti and Ditto. But they have not been able to repeat the feat. \"It's one step forward and two steps back,\" said Wolf. \"We still have the same set of goals, to produce animals for biomedical research and vaccine development, but it's slow.\" </p> <p>Yanagimachi agrees. \"The success rate is low. Most cloned embryos die. We need another breakthrough.\" </p> <p> Yet even the gloomiest cloners have moved far away from the doubts which lingered for months after Dolly was born, when some biologists refused to believe she really was a clone; perhaps they had simply stumbled on an embryonic cell, known as a stem cell, by mistake. </p> <p>Hawaii and Japan have routed the sceptics. \"Now it's simply a matter of working out the challenges of each species,\" says Wolf. </p> <p>\"Eventually it will be proven that you can clone each of the million or so species on the planet.\" </p> <p>Including, presumably, ourselves. The early flirters with human cloning have gone to ground: Richard Seed, the American who announced plans to set up a human cloning clinic in Japan, has not been heard of since that country followed the lead of most of the big western states by banning the practice. There is no suggestion that Clonaid, the company set up by the Raelians, the religious cult which believes the resurrected Christ was a man cloned by aliens, has managed to emulate its extraterrestrial patrons. Like Missiplicity, Clonaid is offering to freeze-store cell samples for future cloning - but of humans, not animals. </p> <p>A more serious human cloning effort was carried out in August 1998 at a fertility clinic in South Korea, where doctors obtained six eggs from two women undergoing fertility treatment, implanted them with cell nucleii from the same women, and managed to grow one to the four-cell stage before deliberately destroying it - the stage at which it could have been implanted in the womb. If true, this was the first recorded case of a human clone. And with hundreds of fertility clinics with similar levels of expertise around the world, all poring over the technical details in scientific journals and patent applications, no-one can be sure that a wealthy individual, able to buy the large number of human eggs which would need to be sacrificed for human cloning to succeed, has not already been cloned, and that his or her infant twin is not already growing. </p> <p>Not only are there powerful incentives, selfish or altruistic, for individuals to seek cloning - infertility, same-sex couples, single men or women who wish to have children without a partner, early loss of a loved one, need for compatible transplant tissue - but some of the ethical issues have already been confronted. In 1990, a young Californian leukaemia patient's life was saved by a bone marrow transplant from her baby sister. Their parents had the second child - the mother was 42, the father needed a reverse vasectomy - only because they needed a source of marrow. Ethicists were dismayed, yet both children went on to grow up healthy in a loving family. </p> <p>The transplant issue - and, indeed, the South Korean furore - highlight why cloning researchers dislike the terms of the human cloning debate. For many animal cloners do want to carry out what is, effectively, human cloning but not to create human replicas. They call it \"therapeutic cloning\" - using the egg's ability to reprogramme cells to manufacture replacement human tissue. Growing replacement brain cells for victims of Parkinson's disease is one of the areas that excites the Roslin researchers. </p> <p>There was disappointment among medical scientists in Britain last year when the government rejected recommendations to ban whole human cloning but permit experiments into cloning human tissue. The government temporarily banned both: it is due to announce within the next few weeks whether it will lift the ban on the second type of cloning. This would allow scientists to experiment with cloning human cells without actually allowing them to clone people. </p> <p>Researchers' enthusiasm to differentiate between the two types of human cloning has made them great promoters of the virtues of old-fashioned sex as the best procreation method. After all, as Yanagimachi points out, a human child is a half-clone of each parent. \"Few species reproduce by cloning. Sexual reproduction produces diversity. Mother Nature somehow chose this method. There must be a reason for that. No one is perfect and they look in their mate for something missing in themselves so that their children are better.\" </p> <p>Griffin agrees. \"I would very much regret this technique being used to clone a human being, but I don't think cloning is going to be popular. Sex is always going to be viewed as cheaper and more enjoyable.\"</p>",

No one is perfect and they look in their mate for something missing in themselves so that their children are better.\" Griffin agrees. \"I would very much regret this technique being used to clone a human being, but I don't think cloning is going to be popular. Sex is always going to be viewed as cheaper and more enjoyable.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Foreign Office minister, Peter Hain, admitted yesterday that Labour's promise to conduct an ethical foreign policy had become an albatross for the government. Mr Hain said the policy had obscured advances that the government had made in various areas and he described it as a \"hook\" on which the government had found itself. The admission was the closest a minister has come to saying in public what Foreign Office diplomats say in private - that Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, made a blunder immediately after the general election in promising to introduce an ethical dimension to foreign policy. The declaration exposed Mr Cook to accusations of hypocrisy after each revelation of arms sales to dubious regimes, in particular Indonesia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. There have also been accusations, highlighted yesterday in the government's response to the Commons foreign affairs select committee, that the government has soft-pedalled on China over Tibet, on Russia over Chechnya and on Saudi Arabia over human rights. The official Foreign Office line is that the announcement of an ethical dimension was not a mistake but it has been misrepresented by the press, which has used it as an unrealistic measure for everything the government does overseas. Mr Hain, who is close to Mr Cook, said in an interview with the New Statesman: \"We don't live in an ethical world and we don't live in a perfect world. I think, if there was a mistake made, it was in allowing the policy to be presented as if we could have perfection.\" He said that British and socialist values, based on principles and morality, would be applied \"as best we can, wherever we can, and we do whatever we can\". He said that China and Russia were difficult cases but both Mr Cook and Tony Blair devoted a lot of time to pressing the human rights case when they met leaders such as the newly-elected Russian president, Vladimir Putin. \"The other thing I would say is: because you can't do everything, is that a reason for doing nothing? I don't think we as a government have been very good at explaining what we are doing in this area. \"I am very struck in the Foreign Office that we are probably more besieged in terms of criticism than any other department over a period.

The only role of the state is to use force when needed.\" Mr Aven, both of whose whose grandfathers died in Stalin's gulag, denied that he was urging a return to the repression of the Soviet era. But he said rampant criminality and corruption could not be tackled by applying the law. \"You can't always fight criminals by staying within the law. You can't always do it peacefully.\" Russia's powerful regional governors would also have to toe the line, he said, and since they were certain to defend their fiefdoms ruthlessly Mr Putin would have \"to use force to suppress them\". Mr Aven, a former foreign Russian trade minister, is well regarded as an economist. Mr Putin, he said, did not have an economic policy, but he had the right economic instincts and leadership qualities.",

At a special summit in Lisbon last week European Union leaders agreed on strategies to help Europe catch up on the United State's daunting lead in e-business. This is Labour's first contribution. The target, agreed with the e-minister, Patricia Hewitt, and Ian McCartney, the minister for e-government, will be to put all government services - now to use the new \"UK Online\" logo - on the internet through PCs, telephone and digital television by 2005. It is an ambitious goal, officials admit, and will include applications for drivers licences and passports. Services already online include NHS Direct, Companies House and the Number 10 website - on which the press secretary's daily briefing is visited far more often than the prime minister's own, more formal offerings. Other services due to join them include tax returns - with discounts of up to \u00a3110 for small businesses who e-file their returns - vehicle excise duty and VAT registrations and the the small business advice service. The prime minister himself has been slow to use the new technolgies - although he is having lessons. Ministers, however, still cannot easily talk to other departments, let alone exchange email with other ministers through the Whitehall network.

Sergei Yastrzhembsky, his war spokesman, conceded yesterday that a unit of 49 interior ministry troops was ambushed at Zhani-Vedeno, 30 miles south-east of the Chechen capital, Grozny, and pinned down for hours by guerrilla fire. He said 16 managed to escape. The bodies of three killed could not be recovered and the rest of the men were missing. A convoy of more than 100 reinforcements was also pinned down by rebel fire when it got within 600 yards of ambushed troops, and had to retreat with at least 20 wounded, Itar-Tass news agency reported. The latest setback came as Moscow said it was stationing up to 25,000 troops permanently in Chechnya, and its special envoy, Nikolai Koshman, called on Mr Putin to establish direct presidential rule in the breakaway republic. Russian military headquarters said an army motorised division of 16,000 men was being deployed permanently to four bases in Chechnya, plus a police brigade of 8,000 men. Before his landslide victory in last weekend's presidential election, Mr Putin said he might impose direct presidential rule on Chechnya, despite there being no legal basis for this.

      "body": "<p>The pre-school movement was not built by women who believed their place was in the home (Playgroup perils, March 29). The playgroup movement was created by concerned parents who didn't need politicians or experts to tell them that their children would benefit from nursery education. In the absence of state provision, they created their own. Forty years later, there are still hundreds of thousands of parents who feel the same way. About half of them are out at work, but they still welcome the chance to be stakeholders in their children's early development.</p> <p>A study to be published shortly by the National Institute of Adult and Continuing Education reports on the experiences of more than 140 parents involved in community-based pre-schools in areas of social and economic disadvantage and shows that pre-schools are far more than just nurseries or playgroups. Dr Veronica McGivney says: \"They deliver a far more holistic service than just childcare ... are a vital family and community resource ... providing social contact, practical and emotional support, education training and employment opportunities and information, help and advice on parenting, education, health, social security and housing matters.\"</p> <p>So why are pre-schools closing? Education Minister Margaret Hodge was sufficiently concerned a year ago to set up a panel of experts to investigate. The panel made 55 recommendations, but the key ones on funding are gathering dust. Could it be that the neat and tidy solution of having all children in school from age three is, secretly, more appealing to education ministers?</p> <p>The loss of children - and, yes, many parents do feel pressured to take a school place for their four-year-olds (Legal challenge to school start, March 30) - has combined with the impact of the national minimum wage and working-time directive to create a financial shortfall which is killing off nurseries and pre-schools which have been in existence for more than 25 years. It may come as a surprise, but staff in pre-schools do have to be paid. The conception of an entirely volunteer workforce ceased to be a reality, like so many other assumptions in Angela Phillips's piece of invective, 20 years ago. <br><b>Margaret Lochrie </b><br> Chief executive, Pre-School Learning Alliance</p> <p>\u0095 Angela Phillips's argument might be all very well if the four-year-olds she is referring to were attending nursery schools or classes. But they are not. They are taking up places in school reception classes which do not necessarily meet their needs. Encouraging under-fives into reception classes in large numbers is just another way of providing pre-school education on the cheap. <b><br> Christine Guedalla </b><br> London</p> <p>\u0095 Playgroups can never compete with the resources of the maintained sector, but they can offer something more valuable. Learning to use limited resources to have fun, improvising joyfully from scrap, can result in far more useful lessons in life and imagination than access to all the latest equipment.</p> <p>Playgroups are less recognised for the contribution they have made to restoring confidence and building employable skills in women who have left the workforce to have children. Thousands of women (not a few of them MPs) found that joining the local playgroup, receiving training (possibly for the first time since leaving school) and perhaps taking part in the management committee enabled them to go on other education jobs, voluntary sector work or even into politics. Playgroups have often transformed women's lives at a time when they had thought they were at the bottom of the heap. <br><b>Frances Ipson</b><br> Bradford</p>",

The playgroup movement was created by concerned parents who didn't need politicians or experts to tell them that their children would benefit from nursery education. In the absence of state provision, they created their own. Forty years later, there are still hundreds of thousands of parents who feel the same way. About half of them are out at work, but they still welcome the chance to be stakeholders in their children's early development. A study to be published shortly by the National Institute of Adult and Continuing Education reports on the experiences of more than 140 parents involved in community-based pre-schools in areas of social and economic disadvantage and shows that pre-schools are far more than just nurseries or playgroups. Dr Veronica McGivney says: \"They deliver a far more holistic service than just childcare ... are a vital family and community resource ... providing social contact, practical and emotional support, education training and employment opportunities and information, help and advice on parenting, education, health, social security and housing matters.\" So why are pre-schools closing? Education Minister Margaret Hodge was sufficiently concerned a year ago to set up a panel of experts to investigate. The panel made 55 recommendations, but the key ones on funding are gathering dust. Could it be that the neat and tidy solution of having all children in school from age three is, secretly, more appealing to education ministers? The loss of children - and, yes, many parents do feel pressured to take a school place for their four-year-olds (Legal challenge to school start, March 30) - has combined with the impact of the national minimum wage and working-time directive to create a financial shortfall which is killing off nurseries and pre-schools which have been in existence for more than 25 years. It may come as a surprise, but staff in pre-schools do have to be paid. The conception of an entirely volunteer workforce ceased to be a reality, like so many other assumptions in Angela Phillips's piece of invective, 20 years ago. Margaret Lochrie Chief executive, Pre-School Learning Alliance \u0095 Angela Phillips's argument might be all very well if the four-year-olds she is referring to were attending nursery schools or classes. But they are not. They are taking up places in school reception classes which do not necessarily meet their needs. Encouraging under-fives into reception classes in large numbers is just another way of providing pre-school education on the cheap. Christine Guedalla London \u0095 Playgroups can never compete with the resources of the maintained sector, but they can offer something more valuable. Learning to use limited resources to have fun, improvising joyfully from scrap, can result in far more useful lessons in life and imagination than access to all the latest equipment. Playgroups are less recognised for the contribution they have made to restoring confidence and building employable skills in women who have left the workforce to have children. Thousands of women (not a few of them MPs) found that joining the local playgroup, receiving training (possibly for the first time since leaving school) and perhaps taking part in the management committee enabled them to go on other education jobs, voluntary sector work or even into politics. Playgroups have often transformed women's lives at a time when they had thought they were at the bottom of the heap. Frances Ipson Bradford",

      "body": "<p>The list of new life peers makes dismal reading. Most names are lacklustre: Sebastian Coe was a distinguished athlete, but not much cop as a legislator - yet he wins a seat in our parliament on the whim of his party leader, whom he serves as judo partner and bag-carrier-in-chief. The Conservative party treasurer Michael Ashcroft must be the first peer-to-be whose elevation comes on condition that he deigns to live in the country whose laws he seeks to write. He has survived controversy, so the ermine will be his. Who else? Labour has reversed its previous distaste for the hereditary peerage by recalling seven of the bluebloods, five of whom will take the Labour whip. Thanks to this manoeuvre, it has now recovered one quarter of the hereditary caucus in the Lords it lost last November: quite a feat. There are some pleasing inclusions. The Labour historian and biographer Kenneth Morgan is one; Matthew Evans, who has kept Faber and Faber an independent-minded publisher, is another. So too is that eloquent advocate of multiculturalism, Bhikhu Parekh. But mostly they are a pretty bland bunch.</p> <p>But what makes this morning's list truly depressing is the headed notepaper on which it arrives: 10 Downing Street. For even though this is the 21st century, and even though we are in the third year of a reforming, Labour government, this woeful practice of prime ministerial appointment to the second chamber continues. Make no mistake, the source of this list - whatever camouflage may be used to disguise the fact - is the office of Tony Blair. We remain governed by a system which allows the executive to handpick one half of our legislature. It is worse than an anomaly; it is an affront to democracy.</p> <p>The indictment amounts to more than the kneejerk criticism that the Lords is being stuffed with Tony's cronies. As it happens, and as Michael White made clear in yesterday's paper, the upper house has been a far from supine creature since the hereditaries were sent packing. It has rebelled repeatedly, inflicting 10 defeats on the government - with the revolts occasionally led by the very Labourites branded \"cronies\". The Lords were right to rebel when they defended the right to trial by jury, right again to insist that candidates in London's mayoral election should get a free mailshot to voters. They were wrong, in our view, to defend Section 28. But the problem is not the merits of the rebellions, but the right of the Lords to stage them. In each case, the government has been able to dismiss these challenges from the Lords as illegitimate. Since they are unelected, says Labour, they have no right to hold up the elected Commons.</p> <p>That suits Labour just fine. Whenever the Lords create trouble, they can be rubbished - even though they sit in an interim second chamber of the government's own making. This is what makes full-blooded reform of the Lords so urgent. As things stand, peers cannot do the job which our system cries out for, acting as a check and balance on the executive. That is not because the wrong people are chosen - as we have seen, one-time cronies can fast become troublemakers. It is because their basis of selection remains so undemocratic. As long as this interim, limbo period remains the Lords will always be dubbed a house of placemen, their challenges to the government waved aside as illegitimate. Yet we need that challenge. To get it, we need to finish the job of reforming our second chamber. That requires not the minimum of elective democracy apparently favoured by Downing Street - but the maximum.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The list of new life peers makes dismal reading. Most names are lacklustre: Sebastian Coe was a distinguished athlete, but not much cop as a legislator - yet he wins a seat in our parliament on the whim of his party leader, whom he serves as judo partner and bag-carrier-in-chief. The Conservative party treasurer Michael Ashcroft must be the first peer-to-be whose elevation comes on condition that he deigns to live in the country whose laws he seeks to write. He has survived controversy, so the ermine will be his. Who else? Labour has reversed its previous distaste for the hereditary peerage by recalling seven of the bluebloods, five of whom will take the Labour whip. Thanks to this manoeuvre, it has now recovered one quarter of the hereditary caucus in the Lords it lost last November: quite a feat. There are some pleasing inclusions. The Labour historian and biographer Kenneth Morgan is one; Matthew Evans, who has kept Faber and Faber an independent-minded publisher, is another. So too is that eloquent advocate of multiculturalism, Bhikhu Parekh. But mostly they are a pretty bland bunch. But what makes this morning's list truly depressing is the headed notepaper on which it arrives: 10 Downing Street. For even though this is the 21st century, and even though we are in the third year of a reforming, Labour government, this woeful practice of prime ministerial appointment to the second chamber continues. Make no mistake, the source of this list - whatever camouflage may be used to disguise the fact - is the office of Tony Blair. We remain governed by a system which allows the executive to handpick one half of our legislature. It is worse than an anomaly; it is an affront to democracy. The indictment amounts to more than the kneejerk criticism that the Lords is being stuffed with Tony's cronies. As it happens, and as Michael White made clear in yesterday's paper, the upper house has been a far from supine creature since the hereditaries were sent packing. It has rebelled repeatedly, inflicting 10 defeats on the government - with the revolts occasionally led by the very Labourites branded \"cronies\". The Lords were right to rebel when they defended the right to trial by jury, right again to insist that candidates in London's mayoral election should get a free mailshot to voters. They were wrong, in our view, to defend Section 28. But the problem is not the merits of the rebellions, but the right of the Lords to stage them. In each case, the government has been able to dismiss these challenges from the Lords as illegitimate. Since they are unelected, says Labour, they have no right to hold up the elected Commons. That suits Labour just fine. Whenever the Lords create trouble, they can be rubbished - even though they sit in an interim second chamber of the government's own making. This is what makes full-blooded reform of the Lords so urgent. As things stand, peers cannot do the job which our system cries out for, acting as a check and balance on the executive. That is not because the wrong people are chosen - as we have seen, one-time cronies can fast become troublemakers. It is because their basis of selection remains so undemocratic. As long as this interim, limbo period remains the Lords will always be dubbed a house of placemen, their challenges to the government waved aside as illegitimate. Yet we need that challenge. To get it, we need to finish the job of reforming our second chamber. That requires not the minimum of elective democracy apparently favoured by Downing Street - but the maximum.",

Roger Whittaker, who recorded three verdicts of unlawful killing at Halifax coroner's court, West Yorkshire, said the confusion that saw families in Britain, Switzerland and Germany receive the wrong bodies in November 1997 was \"a matter of much regret and should not be allowed to happen again\". Mr Whittaker said three generations of a family had been machine-gunned to death at the temples of Luxor on what they had described as their \"holiday of a lifetime\" travelling down the Nile. Shaunnah Turner, five, who had been allowed time off from her school at Ripponden, near Halifax, died with her mother Karina, 24, and grandmother Joan, 53, as six Muslim fundamentalists fired on a coach party on November 17 1997. They were among 51 tourists, mostly Swiss, and seven local people killed. All the terrorists died in the siege and gun battle that followed. The bodies of Joan Turner, a social services coordinator for elderly people, and her daughter, an air stewardess, were misidentified and sent to bereaved families in Switzerland and Germany, whose own relatives' bodies were sent to Yorkshire. Mr Whittaker played a leading role in overcoming red tape in the four countries involved.

Was he familiar with Norwegian blues - a reference to the Sun front page which screamed Tories Dead Official, depicting him as the dead parrot of the Monty Python sketch. \"I thought we agreed there weren't going to be any wisecracks,\" warned Judge Guy Whitburn at Newcastle crown court. Mr Hague was appearing as a prosecution witness in the case against his constituent Harry Sissen, 61, of Northallerton, north Yorkshire, who is accused of four counts of smuggling parrots and two charges of illegally selling a palm cockatoo and a hyacinthine macaw. Sissen is alleged to have confessed to Mr Hague during a meeting at the constituency surgery in October 1998 that he had smuggled parrots. Mr Hague told the court: \"He came to see me to ask me to take up his complaint about the activities of customs and excise which had taken birds away from his premises. \"He was emphatic that he had not in general smuggled birds and eggs into the country and that he was not in general guilty of wrongdoing,\" he said. \"But he did say he smuggled three birds from Yugoslavia. \"He said the violence [in that region] was one of the reasons why he had done this as an exceptional act.\" The prosecution claims that Sissen smuggled three Lear's macaws and six blue-headed macaws into Britain from dealers in Yugoslavia and the Czech Republic between 1997 and 1998. Sissen denies all the charges. The case continues.",

Last October it was revealed that a surgeon working in gynaecology and obstetrics had infected one of his patients at the Pilgrim hospital, in Boston, Lincolnshire. A blood sample he had given in 1993 was then checked and proved to contain the virus. Some 1,400 women on whom he had operated since then at hospitals in Boston, Torbay, Exeter and Southampton were contacted. Three were found to have hepatitis C. The action announced yesterday by the Department of Health is partly an extension of that inquiry back to 1978, the year in which the surgeon started work in the NHS. A further 2,500 patients in 11 hospital trust areas have been told that they may be at risk, including children born by caesarean section. The investigation is being further broadened to include 2,000 patients of a surgeon in London who is thought to have given hepatitis C to two patients last year. Patients the surgeon treated at three London hospitals between 1994 and the end of 1999 have been contacted and invited to seek advice and blood tests. The hospitals are Central Middlesex at Park Royal, and two private hospitals, the Princess Grace, where members of the royal family have been treated, and the Clementine Churchill in Harrow, north west London. \"The chances of a patient being infected with hepatitis C while they receive treatment are very small,\" said Pat Troop, deputy chief medical officer, yesterday. The virus is transmitted from blood to blood, so patients can become infected only if their doctor or surgeon cuts him or herself and the blood enters the patient's wound. But the consequences of infection are serious. Hepatitis C can disappear completely after six months, or lay dormant, or it can attack the liver, causing cirrhosis or cancer. Treatment is expensive. A Bristol woman who does not know how she contracted the virus and is not in any of the at risk categories - although she has had three major operations in the past eight years - is fighting for a six-month course of drugs costing \u00a34,300 to safeguard the healthy part of her liver. Avon health authority has put aside only enough money to treat 30 of the 200 local people who need the drugs. Only four health care workers are known to have been infected with hepatitis C, according to the Department of Health. There has been one previous case in Spain and one in the UK in 1994 which resulted in 300 patients being investigated, but none was found to have been infected. The present inquiry may lead to a change in the rules. Because the virus had so rarely been passed from doctor to patient, there are no restrictions on health care workers who are carrying the hepatitis C virus treating patients unless they have previously transmitted the infection. The government's advisory group on hepatitis is examining the problem. \u0095 Useful sites Hepatitis Foundation British Liver Trust HepNet",

      "bodyText": "Myra Hindley, the moors murderer, is to take her case to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg after her challenge to the home secretary's decision that she should stay in prison for life was decisively rejected yesterday by five law lords. Lawyers for Hindley, 57, argued that the \"whole life\" tariff was unlawful and should not have been used in her case. But Lords Browne-Wilkinson, Nicholls, Steyn, Hutton and Hobhouse held that the tariff was lawful since the home secretary, Jack Straw, had not ruled out reconsidering the decision in future. Hindley was convicted with Ian Brady in 1965 of the murders of Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17. In 1987 the pair confessed to involvement in the murders of three other children. A spokesman for Hindley's solicitors, Taylor Nicholl, said: \"We are obviously disappointed by the outcome of this appeal.

After six days of deliberation at the end of a nine-week trial in the high court, the jurors unanimously found the Sunday Times had failed to prove, on \"the balance of probabilities\", that the secret committee of Protestant dignitaries, loyalist terrorists and RUC officers had never existed. The decision will add force to calls for renewed inquiries into accusations of RUC involvement in loyalist paramilitary killings. David Trimble, Northern Ireland's first minister and leader of the Ulster Unionists, is one of 19 alleged members of the committee and gave evidence at the trial that the allegation was \"simply not credible\". Last night he was swift to insist the verdict was not proof that the committee had existed. Mr McPhilemy was awarded \u00a35,000 less than the \u00a3150,000 limit for libel damages. Outside court he said that it had taken seven years to clear his name, and thanked those who had helped him, and his wife Kathleen and four children for standing by him, through what he called his ordeal. Channel 4, which commissioned the 1991 programme, The Committee, and transmitted it while acknowledging it was \"a risk\", said: \"This verdict confirms how everyone involved in making the programme acted with integrity throughout.\" Times Newspapers Ltd, which faces legal costs of more than \u00a31m, announced it would appeal. \"Nineteen out of 21 alleged members of the committee appeared in court for the Sunday Times. They stated their innocence, and their evidence wasn't challenged,\" said a spokesman. \"In these circumstances, the jury's verdict causes us obvious concerns.\" The case was brought by Mr McPhilemy when the Sunday Times published an article in May 1993 accusing his programme of being \"little more than a collage of unsubstantiated rumours and fabrications\", in which the main source had been paid \u00a35,000 and coached to read scripts. In court the newspaper admitted it could not prove that the source, Jim Sands, a self-professed liar who later retracted his claims, had been paid, but asserted that Mr McPhilemy, 52, had engaged in a \"quite deliberate\" deception. It also alleged he had made \"nasty\" allegations about respectable people, named in a book based on the documentary as committee members and associates, and published seven years later in America. Some of those named, including Mr Trimble, are engaged in separate libel actions against the book's US distributors. The documentary and the book arose after the Irish programme-maker decided in 1990 to investigate whether, as the documentary was to put it, \"a hidden hand might be guiding the loyalist death squads to their targets\". His suspicion had been aroused by stories about leaked security force montages featuring terrorist suspects, and collusion between the security forces and loyalists - collusion that was confirmed by an inquiry by Sir John Stevens, now the commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Mr McPhilemey's researcher, Ben Hamilton, met Mr Sands, who claimed he was a member of the Ulster Central Coordinating Committee, a group of 50 to 60 Protestant businessmen, lawyers and pillars of the community that met regularly with paramilitaries such as Billy Wright (former head of the Loyalist Volunteer Force, killed in the Maze in 1997) to plot the murders of republicans and innocent Catholics.

I saw blood on his chest. It was dreadful. I was screaming and crying for someone to help me. Then Stephen collapsed on the floor.\"</p> <p>Another witness, Alan Decabral, saw Mr Noye smile as he sped from the scene, the court was told.</p> <p>Ms Cable, 21, was giving evidence yesterday afternoon during the first day of the trial of Mr Noye, 52, who is accused of murdering Mr Cameron on Sunday May 19 1996.</p> <p>Sitting in the dock in a grey open-neck shirt and matching cardigan, his eyes darting around the room, Mr Noye heard Julian Bevan QC, prosecuting, describe how Mr Cameron's murder shortly after 1pm at the Swanley interchange of the M25 in Kent was born of \"anger and pride\" following a \"punch-up\" between the two men.</p> <p>He went on to describe how within minutes of the attack, Mr Noye, of West Kingsdown, Kent, set about covering his tracks and fleeing the country carrying a briefcase full of cash.</p> <p>\"What he did following this [attack] clearly tells its own story.\"</p> <p>Mr Noye, he said, made several calls from his mobile phone to associates and his wife, Brenda, and arrangements were swiftly made to fly him out of the country by helicopter to France and then by private jet to Madrid, Spain, before another trip to the south of the country.</p> <p>There was evidence, Mr Bevan told the jury, that the car he was driving, a Land Rover Discovery, had been disposed of.</p> <p><b>Spanish hideout</b></p> <p>Detectives finally tracked Mr Noye to his hideout in Spain in August 1998, the Old Bailey heard.</p> <p>Ms Cable was flown out with a police escort and identified him as he sat in a restaurant.</p> <p>Mr Noye's immediate arrest and extradition last May, following several appeals, led her to face him again - the first time since Mr Cameron died - in a tense hearing in front of Mr Justice Latham at the Old Bailey yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Bevan said the incident which led to Mr Cameron's death and Mr Noye's subsequent escape from the country was sparked by a trivial episode of poor driving.</p> <p>Mr Noye, he claimed, had swerved in front of a small red van driven by Ms Cable, who had passed her driving test seven months before, as she drove with Mr Cameron to London.</p> <p>Mr Cameron shook his head in disapproval and when the two vehicles came to a stop at the next set of traffic lights, Mr Noye got out of his car and walked towards the couple, \"angry at the way in which that van had been driven\".</p> <p>\"Stephen Cameron's decision to get out of that red van and deal with this potentially ugly situation cost him his life.\"</p> <p>The men, who did not know each other, became involved in a \"violent exchange\", the jury was told.</p> <p>Mr Noye punched Mr Cameron hard in the eye and he retaliated by kicking him, the court heard.</p> <p>Ms Cable described how she saw Mr Noye, who had a blank expression on his face, fumbling in the pockets of his short-sleeve jacket as if he was trying to find something.</p> <p>She had pleaded with her boyfriend to get back in the van, but he had told her to stand back.</p> <p>\"He [Noye] broke away from Mr Cameron,\" said Mr Bevan. \"He went towards his Discovery... and it appears he acquired a knife. He returned to face Stephen with the knife in his hand, ready for use with the blade out. Stephen Cameron remained unarmed, empty handed. He lunged at [him] and stabbed him twice in the chest.\"</p> <p>During her evidence, Ms Cable said the knife was four inches long and that Mr Noye had approached her boyfriend with \"his hand out, the blade towards Steve\".</p> <p>\"He was kicking at him. I was scared. I was screaming and running, calling for someone to help me because I was frightened. The next thing I saw was Steve coming towards me. The other man was driving off.\"</p> <p>Mr Bevan described how the first wound went to a depth of 16cm (6in) and penetrated Cameron's heart.</p> <p>\"The direction of the wound was upwards, backwards and inwards.\"</p> <p>The second wound went to a depth of 18cm and penetrated his liver.</p> <p>\"According to one of the pathologists, [Stephen] was rotating away from the knife when he was stabbed.

      "bodyText": "The fianc\u00e9e of a man allegedly killed by Kenneth Noye in a road rage attack fought back tears yesterday as she described seeing her unarmed boyfriend desperately trying to kick a knife away from Mr Noye's hand before being stabbed in the heart. In a faint voice, with her hands trembling by her side, Danielle Cable told the Old Bailey how Stephen Cameron, 21, stumbled towards her with blood seeping from the two wounds as Mr Noye raced away in his car. \"I saw Steve clutching his chest,\" she told the jury yesterday. \"He said, 'he stabbed me Dan, take his number plate.' I saw blood on his chest. It was dreadful. I was screaming and crying for someone to help me. Then Stephen collapsed on the floor.\" Another witness, Alan Decabral, saw Mr Noye smile as he sped from the scene, the court was told. Ms Cable, 21, was giving evidence yesterday afternoon during the first day of the trial of Mr Noye, 52, who is accused of murdering Mr Cameron on Sunday May 19 1996. Sitting in the dock in a grey open-neck shirt and matching cardigan, his eyes darting around the room, Mr Noye heard Julian Bevan QC, prosecuting, describe how Mr Cameron's murder shortly after 1pm at the Swanley interchange of the M25 in Kent was born of \"anger and pride\" following a \"punch-up\" between the two men. He went on to describe how within minutes of the attack, Mr Noye, of West Kingsdown, Kent, set about covering his tracks and fleeing the country carrying a briefcase full of cash. \"What he did following this [attack] clearly tells its own story.\" Mr Noye, he said, made several calls from his mobile phone to associates and his wife, Brenda, and arrangements were swiftly made to fly him out of the country by helicopter to France and then by private jet to Madrid, Spain, before another trip to the south of the country. There was evidence, Mr Bevan told the jury, that the car he was driving, a Land Rover Discovery, had been disposed of. Spanish hideout Detectives finally tracked Mr Noye to his hideout in Spain in August 1998, the Old Bailey heard. Ms Cable was flown out with a police escort and identified him as he sat in a restaurant. Mr Noye's immediate arrest and extradition last May, following several appeals, led her to face him again - the first time since Mr Cameron died - in a tense hearing in front of Mr Justice Latham at the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr Bevan said the incident which led to Mr Cameron's death and Mr Noye's subsequent escape from the country was sparked by a trivial episode of poor driving. Mr Noye, he claimed, had swerved in front of a small red van driven by Ms Cable, who had passed her driving test seven months before, as she drove with Mr Cameron to London. Mr Cameron shook his head in disapproval and when the two vehicles came to a stop at the next set of traffic lights, Mr Noye got out of his car and walked towards the couple, \"angry at the way in which that van had been driven\". \"Stephen Cameron's decision to get out of that red van and deal with this potentially ugly situation cost him his life.\" The men, who did not know each other, became involved in a \"violent exchange\", the jury was told. Mr Noye punched Mr Cameron hard in the eye and he retaliated by kicking him, the court heard. Ms Cable described how she saw Mr Noye, who had a blank expression on his face, fumbling in the pockets of his short-sleeve jacket as if he was trying to find something. She had pleaded with her boyfriend to get back in the van, but he had told her to stand back. \"He [Noye] broke away from Mr Cameron,\" said Mr Bevan. \"He went towards his Discovery... and it appears he acquired a knife. He returned to face Stephen with the knife in his hand, ready for use with the blade out. Stephen Cameron remained unarmed, empty handed. He lunged at [him] and stabbed him twice in the chest.\" During her evidence, Ms Cable said the knife was four inches long and that Mr Noye had approached her boyfriend with \"his hand out, the blade towards Steve\". \"He was kicking at him. I was scared. I was screaming and running, calling for someone to help me because I was frightened. The next thing I saw was Steve coming towards me. The other man was driving off.\" Mr Bevan described how the first wound went to a depth of 16cm (6in) and penetrated Cameron's heart. \"The direction of the wound was upwards, backwards and inwards.\" The second wound went to a depth of 18cm and penetrated his liver. \"According to one of the pathologists, [Stephen] was rotating away from the knife when he was stabbed. Danielle Cable was hysterical.\" Cameron collapsed, never to regain consciousness, and was declared dead at hospital 50 minutes later. Stabbed Mr Bevan said Mr Noye now admitted that he had stabbed Mr Cameron - he had denied being the second driver during the extradition proceedings - but would insist that he had been acting in self-defence. \"It's the crown's case that this stabbing to death of Stephen Cameron was not merely unlawful, it was murder,\" he said. As Mr Cameron's life slipped away, Mr Noye was busy on his mobile phone, probably believing that someone had taken down the registration number of his car, the court heard. He had bought it in 1995 from a man called Terence Hole and registered it in the name of Anthony Francis, quoting an address in Bridgen Road, Bexley, Kent, owned by a friend of his, Peter Horton. Mr Noye called Mr Hole and Mr Horton on several occasions in the hour after the attack. He also spoke with his wife Brenda and son Kevin, and at 10.42pm called a private aviation company owned by an associate. \"He took the necessary steps to stop anyone telling the police the true identity of the driver,\" said Mr Bevan. The following day, he flew out of the country by private helicopter from the Bristol area to a golf course in France, taking a briefcase full of cash. He was wearing a flat cloth cap, which he left in the aircraft, and from there he went to Spain, probably using a false passport with the name of Mr Green. Mr Bevan said the Land Rover Discovery driven by Mr Noye had never been found, but offered the jury two intriguing tales. False name and address Witnesses had seen a vehicle similar to Mr Noye's being taken to a car yard owned by one of his friends, Tommy Lee, in Dartford, Kent, where it might have been destroyed. An AA membership card in the name of Kenneth Noye was found there by detectives. And the day after the killing, a man giving the false name of John Grittins bought a Land Rover Discovery from a dealer in north London, paying \u00a312,000 in cash from a plastic bag. The address the man gave was false and the car was later found outside Mr Noye's home. During cross-examination by Stephen Batten QC, for Mr Noye, Ms Cable admitted Mr Noye did not look angry when he got out of his car. He suggested that Mr Cameron had initiated the fight and had had the upper hand. \"Is it the fact that you told the police, and indeed told us, far less than you really saw because you found it, perhaps totally naturally, difficult to admit that any of this was Stephen's fault?\" Ms Cable replied: \"No, I don't believe it was his fault at all.\" When asked if her fiance had \"something of a temper\", she said she had never seen it. Mr Batten asked if she knew about him losing his temper at their engagement party when he urinated on a neighbour's fence and banged on his door. She admitted that she had seen them fighting. Mr Batten asked: \"Would you say that Stephen was a young man who thought he could take care of himself without too much difficulty? Jurors to be given escorts Jurors are each to be given escorts throughout the trial. Lord Justice Latham said: \"It is I, am afraid, necessary to take these steps just to ensure there is no problem about people trying to approach you. There are many people who have an interest in this case and its outcome. \"I have arranged for you to be provided with escorts that will, I am afraid, affect your daily life to some extent.\" But he insisted that this should not be seen to be \"in any way prejudicial\" to the defendant. \"It is absolutely vital... that Mr Noye is given a fair trial,\" he said. Miss Cable said: \"Yes, I suppose he thought he could take care of himself.\" The case continues tomorrow.",

Fears of a unionist backlash against the report, which called for the removal of royal symbols from Northern Ireland's courts, proved unfounded as Ulster Unionist supporters of the Good Friday agreement made clear they could live with its findings. The response to the review of the criminal justice system, set up under the Good Friday agreement, was welcomed by the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson. The report, likely to be implemented after a six-month consultation period, would introduce sweeping changes to Northern Ireland's legal system to remove what nationalists see as overtly British symbols. Judges would no longer swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen, and an independent commission would be set up to increase the number of nationalists sitting as judges. In the most controversial area of the report, all royal symbols would be removed from inside Northern Ireland's courts. However, the Royal Coat of Arms would remain on the outside of existing courthouses and the union flag would continue to fly. The report's authors underlined their determination to strike a balance between unionists, who see royal symbols as an important sign of Northern Ireland's position within the United Kingdom, and nationalists who regard such symbols as alien. \"We considered the removal of all symbols but felt that this could be misinterpreted as being inconsistent with Northern Ireland's constitutional position,\" the report said. \"On the other hand, we are conscious that the presence of the Royal Coat of Arms in a prominent position in the courtroom could be regarded by some as inconsistent with the need for court proceedings to take place in a neutral environment.\" Their even-handed approach was welcomed by allies of Mr Trimble, the Ulster Unionist party leader.

The ITV version of the Mayor of Casterbridge has already been in the planning for two years (OK, not that long considering it was written 114 years ago). It was put on the back-burner because of a costume drama bottleneck (cue vision of carriages jammed in authentic looking mud-drenched London square) before Alan Bleasdale's Oliver Twist got out of the way at Christmas. </p> <p>But what will be appearing on ITV this 'season' is Skinner and Baddiel Unplanned. A re-version of the duo's sofa-bound comedic chat show, the programme will put them on the spot like never before. They've promised not to script a single line, leaving their wits to do the talking on cue from the audience. </p> <p>And to make life even harder for themselves Frank Skinner and David Baddiel are thought to have promised - on their team's lives - not to talk about football. Could be very tricky, considering the show will start just days before this year's Euro 2000 championship. How will they resist the temptation? But then, you'd expect them to have to do something to earn the \u00a3600,000 they're reported to have secured for the show. </p> <p> Lucy Rouse is editor of Broadcast magazine</p>",

      "bodyText": "ITV kicked off the round of spring/summer programme launches this week. Like the summer sales, this is the annual process by which each and every broadcaster tells us what it's got in store for the season - with one subtle difference: we're meant to flock in our millions to view the programmes on offer, not expect cut-price bargains to take away with us. Headlining the ITV line up is drama: the costume variety with Nicholas Nickleby and the Mayor of Casterbridge both set to grace our screens. But because of the lead-times involved in flounce-tastic numbers like this, we won't see these before the leaves begin to fall this autumn. The ITV version of the Mayor of Casterbridge has already been in the planning for two years (OK, not that long considering it was written 114 years ago). It was put on the back-burner because of a costume drama bottleneck (cue vision of carriages jammed in authentic looking mud-drenched London square) before Alan Bleasdale's Oliver Twist got out of the way at Christmas. But what will be appearing on ITV this 'season' is Skinner and Baddiel Unplanned. A re-version of the duo's sofa-bound comedic chat show, the programme will put them on the spot like never before. They've promised not to script a single line, leaving their wits to do the talking on cue from the audience. And to make life even harder for themselves Frank Skinner and David Baddiel are thought to have promised - on their team's lives - not to talk about football. Could be very tricky, considering the show will start just days before this year's Euro 2000 championship. How will they resist the temptation? But then, you'd expect them to have to do something to earn the \u00a3600,000 they're reported to have secured for the show. Lucy Rouse is editor of Broadcast magazine",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair is bracing himself for Labour's worst electoral performance in nearly a decade at next month's local elections, according to a secret cabinet memo seen by the Guardian. Ministers, who are gathering at Chequers today for a pre-general election brainstorming session, have been warned that the Tories are on course to win back control of a series of councils throughout England won by Labour at the height of John Major's unpopularity in 1996. The memo, written by Hilary Armstrong, the local government minister, and Ian McCartney, the cabinet office minister, comes as the normally loyal Labour leader in local government, Sir Jeremy Beecham, mounts an attack on the way Downing Street is centralising power in Whitehall and belittling the role of councillors. Complaining of a gung-ho approach in Downing Street and the death of local democracy, Sir Jeremy warns that the government's \"frontline first\" rhetoric and more ring-fencing of funds \"is pushing relentlessly in the direction of government central control\". Sir Jeremy, in a Guardian article intended as a warning shot to Mr Blair, writes: \"The belittling of the role of local councillors by government is not confined to local funding decisions. Their role in leading communities and representing the interests of communities is also under relentless attack.\" Ministers will be parachuted in to try to whip up support among disillusioned traditional Labour voters before May 4. The memo candidly admits that the party faces large losses - mainly to the Tories.

      "bodyText": "William Hague yesterday gave his backing to a Conservative drive to recruit more women as parliamentary candidates, as it became clear that the party is failing to select women for winnable seats. The Women into Public Life campaign will include \"talent spotting\" of potential candidates, a national programme of events to encourage women to move into local and national politics, and more advising of prospective women parliamentarians. However, it stops short of introducing quotas. The campaign, launched yesterday alongside a document called Choices to highlight Conservative policies affecting women, reflects unease among party strategists that it will once again return only a handful of female MPs. Of the 196 constituencies that have so far selected a candidate for the next general election, only 32 - 16% - have chosen women, and among the party's top 10 target seats only one women is running. Senior figures in the party acknowledge that it has been left behind by the government in addressing women's issues and must listen to their concerns if it is to win back those whose votes were lost to Labour at the last election. The drive to add more women MPs to the Tories' current 14, compared with Labour's 101, follows two highly critical reports by Tory-leaning think tanks which said the party was failing women and would be punished at the polls. Conservative Women, by Tessa Keswick for the Centre for Policy Studies, said too many party members \"hanker for the days of the subservient family woman\" and urged the leadership to \"set out a new strategy based on the full and equal participation of women\". In 1997 the swing from Tory to Labour was higher among women than men, and among women aged 18-35 Labour had a 22% lead. While electoral necessity will push the Tories to address female concerns - market research has identifed \"Florida woman\", one who holidays in America, as a key voter to target - they will steer clear of Labour's strategy of defining issues, such as equal pay, which affect women. Launching Choices yesterday, the shadow education and employment secretary, Theresa May, said the government had wrongly \"compartmentalised\" women's issues. The Conservatives plan a \"family scholarship\" scheme to help women to return to their careers after bringing up children, the extension of closed circuit TV in stations and car parks, and universal testing for HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer.",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair today moves to create greater parity between Labour and the Conservatives in the House of Lords with the appointment of 33 new working peers to the second chamber.</p> <p>In a step towards the government's pledge to rebalance the once Tory-dominated Lords to reflect parties' share of the vote at the last general election, the new intake will comprise 20 Labour peers, nine Liberal Democrats and four Conservatives.</p> <p>The new influx, which follows the exit of all but 92 hereditary peers last November, leaves the upper house with almost 700 members. Of those, 202 are Labour, 236 Tory, 63 Lib Dem and 161 cross bench (without party affiliation), plus 26 archbishops and bishops.</p> <p>Among the new recruits are a clutch of exotically-named aristocrats, including Thomas Orlando Lyttleton (Viscount Chandos); Julian Pascoe Francis St Leger (Baron Grenfell); and Anthony Fitzhardinge Gueterbock (Baron Berkeley).</p> <p>The three are among five former Labour hereditary peers brought back to the Lords, together with a string of figures from the public sector, academia and trade unions.</p> <p>The nine Lib Dems - fewer than the 15 the party had sought but almost double the five it was originally offered - include another Tony Greaves, a former councillor in Pendle, Lancashire and an energetic party activist known for his bobble hat and ability to get up the nose of a series of party leaders.</p> <p>The Tory new intake includes Sebastian Coe, the Olympic gold medal-winning runner and Conservative leader William Hague's chief of staff.</p> <p>Together, the 29 Labour and Lib Dems peers are regarded as fresh ammunition in Mr Blair's battle to push the repeal of section 28, which bans the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities.</p> <p>Despite the exodus of the hereditaries, the part-reformed Lords has rejected both the repeal of the clause and a government attempt to push through a compromise of new pro-family sex education guidance for schools, as well as inflicting a string of other defeats on the government this year over issues ranging from the London mayor and Greater London authority elections to the regulation of private hospitals and homes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair today moves to create greater parity between Labour and the Conservatives in the House of Lords with the appointment of 33 new working peers to the second chamber. In a step towards the government's pledge to rebalance the once Tory-dominated Lords to reflect parties' share of the vote at the last general election, the new intake will comprise 20 Labour peers, nine Liberal Democrats and four Conservatives. The new influx, which follows the exit of all but 92 hereditary peers last November, leaves the upper house with almost 700 members. Of those, 202 are Labour, 236 Tory, 63 Lib Dem and 161 cross bench (without party affiliation), plus 26 archbishops and bishops. Among the new recruits are a clutch of exotically-named aristocrats, including Thomas Orlando Lyttleton (Viscount Chandos); Julian Pascoe Francis St Leger (Baron Grenfell); and Anthony Fitzhardinge Gueterbock (Baron Berkeley). The three are among five former Labour hereditary peers brought back to the Lords, together with a string of figures from the public sector, academia and trade unions. The nine Lib Dems - fewer than the 15 the party had sought but almost double the five it was originally offered - include another Tony Greaves, a former councillor in Pendle, Lancashire and an energetic party activist known for his bobble hat and ability to get up the nose of a series of party leaders. The Tory new intake includes Sebastian Coe, the Olympic gold medal-winning runner and Conservative leader William Hague's chief of staff. Together, the 29 Labour and Lib Dems peers are regarded as fresh ammunition in Mr Blair's battle to push the repeal of section 28, which bans the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities. Despite the exodus of the hereditaries, the part-reformed Lords has rejected both the repeal of the clause and a government attempt to push through a compromise of new pro-family sex education guidance for schools, as well as inflicting a string of other defeats on the government this year over issues ranging from the London mayor and Greater London authority elections to the regulation of private hospitals and homes.",

The home secretary's latest proposals have infuriated four of parliament's leading figures who yesterday announced they have tabled changes to his bill when it comes back to the Commons next week. The rebellion is being led by four Commons committee chairmen - three Labour and the fourth a surprise Tory rebel - who want to strengthen the public's \"right to know\" under the legislation. They were expected yesterday to become a rallying point for some 200 Labour rebels who have signed a parliamentary motion demanding stronger legislation to end Whitehall secrecy. So serious are ministers taking the revolt that Mike O' Brien - Jack Straw's trusted deputy handling open government - is carrying a list of the rebels in his ministerial red box for instant reference. The four senior rebels are David Davis, Tory chairman of the public accounts committee; Giles Radice, chairman of the Treasury committee; Tony Wright, chairman of the Commons public administration committee; and Robin Corbett, chairman of the home affairs committee. They were joined yesterday by former minister Mark Fisher; Tory freedom of information campaigner, Richard Shepherd and Liberal Democrat constitutional affairs spokesman, Robert Maclennan.

      "body": "<b>Michael Ashcroft </b> <br>Michael Ashcroft's struggle to convert his billion pound fortune into the kind of respectability that ends in a peerage has been one of the bloodiest in living memory. <p>Ashcroft, 52, is the son of a civil servant and as a boy lived in Belize, then a British colony but later, as an independent state, to figure largely in his financial dealings. He attended Norwich grammar school. </p> <p>He was 26 when he borrowed \u00a315,000 to set up a cleaning business that, four years later, he sold for \u00a31m. His talent for deal-making was impressive but made colleagues in the City jealous and nervous. In 1984 he moved his interests to Florida, took over the ADT security firm for \u00a3600m, then moved to Belize, attracted by lax banking laws he helped set up. </p> <p>Throughout his rise he had enemies who said he sailed too close to the wind, though friends describe him as unorthodox. Only when he emerged from the wreck of the Tory defeat in 1997 as donor and treasurer to William Hague, did the fight get really dirty. </p> <p>The Spectator called him \"The Man who Bought the Tory party\" and the Times ran articles which hinted that his complex interests were involved in laundering drug money from the Caribbean - suggestions which it denied making when both sides backed down last year over Mr Ashcroft's libel suit. </p> <p>He has bought a \u00a32m home 200 yards from the Lords and promised to start paying UK taxes again. <br>Michael White </p> <p><b>Matthew Evans</b><br>If everyone has a book in them, then the one inside Matthew Evans, chairman of publishers Faber and Faber, at the moment is probably How To Lose Friends And Alienate People. </p> <p>For a man noted for his charm and ability to smooth the most febrile of egos, his first day as the government's \"museums tsar\" was unfortunate to say the least. A robust speech to launch the new Museums, Libraries and Archive Commission - which he will head - managed to rub everyone up the wrong way. Museums, he maintained, needed to change drastically or risk turning into the \"cultural version of Marks and Spencer\". Even institutions at each others' throats over charging united in horror at this interloper who merrily admitted knowing little about them. They were not to know that Evans, a founder of the Groucho Club, has a dry sense of humour. </p> <p>Evans, of course, was right about the most salient fact, attendances are falling and no one quite knows what to do. The next day, well aware of the upset caused, culture secretary Chris Smith delivered the gentlest of raps on the knuckles. As a publisher, though, few would disagree that Evans is without peer. Irreverent, indiscreet, entertaining and astute, he managed to modernise once fusty Faber without sacrificing its commitment to writing of the highest quality and the writers that produce it. </p> <p>Twice married, he has a home in the Cotswolds, and a seat on the board of the Royal Court theatre.<br>Fiachra Gibbons</p> <p><b>Sebastian Coe</b> <br>A peerage for Coe, 43, is reward for his service as deputy chief of staff then private secretary, and judo sparring partner, for William Hague. The Loughborough university-educated middle distance runner was made an MBE in 1982 and OBE in 1990.

      "bodyText": "Michael Ashcroft Michael Ashcroft's struggle to convert his billion pound fortune into the kind of respectability that ends in a peerage has been one of the bloodiest in living memory. Ashcroft, 52, is the son of a civil servant and as a boy lived in Belize, then a British colony but later, as an independent state, to figure largely in his financial dealings. He attended Norwich grammar school. He was 26 when he borrowed \u00a315,000 to set up a cleaning business that, four years later, he sold for \u00a31m. His talent for deal-making was impressive but made colleagues in the City jealous and nervous. In 1984 he moved his interests to Florida, took over the ADT security firm for \u00a3600m, then moved to Belize, attracted by lax banking laws he helped set up. Throughout his rise he had enemies who said he sailed too close to the wind, though friends describe him as unorthodox. Only when he emerged from the wreck of the Tory defeat in 1997 as donor and treasurer to William Hague, did the fight get really dirty. The Spectator called him \"The Man who Bought the Tory party\" and the Times ran articles which hinted that his complex interests were involved in laundering drug money from the Caribbean - suggestions which it denied making when both sides backed down last year over Mr Ashcroft's libel suit. He has bought a \u00a32m home 200 yards from the Lords and promised to start paying UK taxes again. Michael White Matthew Evans If everyone has a book in them, then the one inside Matthew Evans, chairman of publishers Faber and Faber, at the moment is probably How To Lose Friends And Alienate People. For a man noted for his charm and ability to smooth the most febrile of egos, his first day as the government's \"museums tsar\" was unfortunate to say the least. A robust speech to launch the new Museums, Libraries and Archive Commission - which he will head - managed to rub everyone up the wrong way. Museums, he maintained, needed to change drastically or risk turning into the \"cultural version of Marks and Spencer\". Even institutions at each others' throats over charging united in horror at this interloper who merrily admitted knowing little about them. They were not to know that Evans, a founder of the Groucho Club, has a dry sense of humour. Evans, of course, was right about the most salient fact, attendances are falling and no one quite knows what to do. The next day, well aware of the upset caused, culture secretary Chris Smith delivered the gentlest of raps on the knuckles. As a publisher, though, few would disagree that Evans is without peer. Irreverent, indiscreet, entertaining and astute, he managed to modernise once fusty Faber without sacrificing its commitment to writing of the highest quality and the writers that produce it. Twice married, he has a home in the Cotswolds, and a seat on the board of the Royal Court theatre. Fiachra Gibbons Sebastian Coe A peerage for Coe, 43, is reward for his service as deputy chief of staff then private secretary, and judo sparring partner, for William Hague. The Loughborough university-educated middle distance runner was made an MBE in 1982 and OBE in 1990. He became MP for Falmouth and Camborne in 1992, serving as a parliamentary aide to defence ministers and then Michael Heseltine as deputy prime minister, before losing his seat in 1997. He is married with two sons and two daughters. Janet Cohen Mrs Cohen, 59, is a leading merchant banker and BBC governor. A non-executive director and consultant at Charterhouse bank since 1988, she is a Cambridge law graduate and qualified as a solicitor in 1965. She was a senior civil servant for 13 years, before joining Charterhouse. She also became an associate fellow of Newnham College, 1988-91. Mrs Cohen, married with three children, also enjoys a successful second career as a thriller writer, writing under her maiden name Janet Neel. Richard Layard One of the architects of the government's flagship New Deal project to get the long term unemployed back to work, he is director of the Centre of Economic Performance, and professor of economics at the London School of Economics. He is also an adviser to David Blunkett, the education secretary.

Until this week, lower military officials had taken the blame for the estimated 3,000 people who were murdered or went missing. Many of the killings were carried out by Gen Pinochet's security police. Now, in a macabre version of a Latin soap opera, one retired army officer after another has used the midnight television news to reveal details of grisly executions they insist were ordered by Gen Pinochet in the early years of his 1973-90 dictatorship. They include two notorious incidents: the 1976 car-bombing of the Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier in Washington and the \"caravan of death\", in which at least 75 political prisoners were taken from jails throughout Chile in 1973 by an elite squad and executed after torture. The unit was commanded by General Sergio Arellano Stark. Under interrogation by Juan Guzman, the Chilean judge who is building a case against Gen Pinochet, former general Oscar Haag Blaschke and captain Patricio Diaz Araneda have fingered the former dictator. According to press leaks, Gen Blaschke, who was in the \"caravan\" squad, told Mr Guzman that he was shown a document naming Gen Stark as the \"official delegate of the commander in chief and president of the government [Pinochet]\". The \"caravan of death\" is the most prominent of the 78 criminal cases being investigated by Chilean justice officials. It forms the basis for moves to have Gen Pinochet stripped of his legal immunity as a senate, the first step towards putting him on trial. The lawyer for Manuel Contreras, the former secret police chief who is in prison for planning assasinations abroad during the coup years, has warned in a press conference that his client may soon unleash a host of new documents - some expected to link Gen Pinochet directly to killings. In addition, the Chilean historian Patricia Verdugo has published a damning secret military document in which a senior intelligence officer under Gen Pinochet, Brigadier Pedro Espinoza, claims that he was \"pressured to only blame my direct commander [for Letelier's assassination], not allowing me to also hold responsible the president of the republic\". Ms Verdugo says that the document, and others, were sent to her by an anonymous Chilean officer who was troubled by his conscience. In the document, Brig Espinoza, who is in prison for the assassination, complains that he is paying \"a very high and unjust price\" for the crime, then alludes to a chain of command through which he received his orders. The accusations against Gen Pinochet have mounted at such a rate that some worry that he is being transformed into a scapegoat. \"I fear that this is part of an operation to cast all the blame on Pinochet so the others involved don't assume responsibility for their participation,\" said one Socialist congressman, Juan Pablo Letelier, the son of the murdered diplomat.

      "bodyText": "About 350 computer hackers from around the world fought off security interrogations, attempts to silence them and an all-around bad image to complete the first hacker convention in Israel yesterday. The two-day Tel Aviv gathering, which included \"hack these sites\" and \"spot the feds\" competitions, was the first such gathering since hackers disabled the Yahoo and eBay sites in February. At the request of MPs, the police had considered banning the conference, but the attorney general, Eliyakim Rubinstein, gave it the go-ahead. The police did prevent the organisers publishing a list of Israeli commercial websites vulnerable to break-in. To compile the list, participants attacked sites offered by Israeli companies. The site owners were confident that no one could thwart them, but were proved wrong. The hackers said that 28% of the Israeli internet was vulnerable. One of the hackers, John Draper of Freemont, California, said they wanted to put a better face on the practice. \"A hacker is developing programs to make them better,\" he said. \"They aren't people who break into computer systems. That's a cracker.\" Mr Draper helped to launch the hacker phenomenon in 1971 when he discovered that a toy whistle reproduced the tone needed to open a free telephone line. AP",

Portugal, the current holder of the European Union presidency, announced it would raise the issue at a forthcoming meeting of interior ministers, despite formal insistence from London that nothing illegal was taking place. Britain and the US both wrote to the EU's enterprise commissioner, Erkki Liikanen of Finland, to say that they were doing no wrong, but a heated European parliament debate on the Echelon electronic surveillance system left open the possibility that MEPs would demand a formal investigation into the allegations. And Britain's letter, written by its EU ambassador Sir Stephen Wall, fuelled speculation by referring to \"safeguarding the nation's economic well-being\" as one of the reasons for which telecommunications could be legally intercepted. But he denied that British facilities were used by other states to gain commercial advantage. Echelon, established during the cold war and operated by the US, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, is reportedly capable of intercepting millions of telephone, fax and email messages. James Woolsey, who headed the CIA from 1993-95, has already admitted what to many had long seemed obvious - that the US secretly collects information on European firms. He wrote in last week's Wall Street Journal: \"That's right, my continental friends, we have spied on you because you bribe. When we have caught you at it, you might be interested, we haven't said a word to the US companies in the competition. \"Instead we go to the gov ernment you're bribing and tell its officials that we don't take kindly to such corruption.\" He insisted however that it only targeted firms which violated UN sanctions or offered bribes to gain business. Jonathan Faull, spokesman for the European commission, called Mr Woolsey's comments an \"outrageous slur\" intended to justify spying. Until yesterday, Echelon was a minor issue rumbling along almost unnoticed in the European parliament. But Portugal's surprise decision to raise it in the council of ministers puts it into a different league. It will alarm British ministers concerned about the image of an either-or-choice between the US or Europe. It will also boost interest in the intelligence services at a time when allegations about Libyan dirty tricks and the loss of laptops by secret agents is attracting unwelcome attention. \"We really don't think its necessary for EU ministers to discuss this,\" said one Whitehall official. \"But we will stand our ground.\" Duncan Campbell, the British investigative journalist, has claimed that the US used Echelon to beat the European consortium Airbus to a major plane deal with Saudi Arabia in 1994. Portugal's interior minister, Fernando Gomes, who said the matter would now be referred to ministers, added that no evidence existed to confirm a 1998 parliamentary report saying European firms lose several billion dollars per year as a result of corporate espionage. The European parliament is not about to lose interest in the subject. Jean-Claude Martinez, an MEP from the far-right French National Front said during yesterday's debate: \"We were told that Austria's Haider was the real threat to the EU. Now we see it is Tony Blair.\" Robert Evans, a Labour MEP, said British MEPs would block calls for an investigation.",

While Mr Giuliani has concentrated on tapping into a well-funded network of conservative donors, Hillary has run a campaign focused on issues New Yorkers care about such as education, health care and the economy.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's funding revelation marks the lowest point in the Mr Giuliani's bid for the senate seat to date. This week he lost ground in the polls after facing criticism of his handling of the latest police shooting of an unarmed black man.</p> <p>Mr Giuliani took the unprecedented step of authorising the release of court and police records related to Patrick Dorismond after he was killed by an undercover policeman two weeks ago. His refusal to offer his condolences to the Dorismond family while congratulating the police officers involved was largely blamed for sparking the outrage that led to violent protests at Mr Dorismond's funeral.</p> <p>A report in yesterday's New York Times also revealed that Mr Giuliani's stance is causing concern among New York police officers.</p> <p>Half of the people polled by Marist College disapproved of Mr Giuliani's handing of the Dorismond incident.</p> <p>Friends of Giuliani, the campaign team for the mayor, was not available for comment yesterday. It has not yet been revealed how much the mayor has raised in the first quarter which ends today. Republicans typically raise more than Democrats in New York because of their connections with Wall Street but Mrs Clinton has been assiduously fund-raising since last year.</p> <p>She has attended investment bank breakfasts and tapped the support of the media and entertainment industry with glitzy fund-raising events.</p> <p>In a radio interview yesterday, Mr Giuliani played down his slide in the polls, saying his poll numbers were still good, considering the criticism he had faced since the Dorismond shooting. \"There are few names I haven't been called in the last 12 days,\" he said.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Mr Giuliani also conceded defeat in his battle with the Brooklyn Museum of Art over its showing of the Sensation exhibition of modern art. The mayor had taken offence at a painting of the Virgin Mary adorned with elephant dung.</p>",

Campaign staff for Mrs Clinton's race against mayor Rudolph Giuliani in New York said no other candidate had ever raised so much money in the first quarter of an election year. News of Mrs Clinton's overflowing war chest came on the same day that a poll released by Marist College showed that the Mr Giuliani and Mrs Clinton are running neck and neck as his ratings fell to their lowest level since last October. The previous record for campaign fund-raising in this race was held by the Republican Oliver North, the Irangate officer, who raised $2.9m in his campaign against Senator Charles Robb, in Virginia. This dubious precedent did not prevent the Clinton team from pointing out that Mr Giuliani had employed one of Mr North's leading finance consultants, Richard Viguerie, to advise his campaign. Howard Wolfson, the Clinton campaign spokesman, called the fund-raising success \"outstanding\". He said: \"Hillary's candidacy has energised people across New York state. While Mr Giuliani has concentrated on tapping into a well-funded network of conservative donors, Hillary has run a campaign focused on issues New Yorkers care about such as education, health care and the economy.\" Yesterday's funding revelation marks the lowest point in the Mr Giuliani's bid for the senate seat to date. This week he lost ground in the polls after facing criticism of his handling of the latest police shooting of an unarmed black man. Mr Giuliani took the unprecedented step of authorising the release of court and police records related to Patrick Dorismond after he was killed by an undercover policeman two weeks ago. His refusal to offer his condolences to the Dorismond family while congratulating the police officers involved was largely blamed for sparking the outrage that led to violent protests at Mr Dorismond's funeral. A report in yesterday's New York Times also revealed that Mr Giuliani's stance is causing concern among New York police officers. Half of the people polled by Marist College disapproved of Mr Giuliani's handing of the Dorismond incident. Friends of Giuliani, the campaign team for the mayor, was not available for comment yesterday. It has not yet been revealed how much the mayor has raised in the first quarter which ends today. Republicans typically raise more than Democrats in New York because of their connections with Wall Street but Mrs Clinton has been assiduously fund-raising since last year. She has attended investment bank breakfasts and tapped the support of the media and entertainment industry with glitzy fund-raising events. In a radio interview yesterday, Mr Giuliani played down his slide in the polls, saying his poll numbers were still good, considering the criticism he had faced since the Dorismond shooting. \"There are few names I haven't been called in the last 12 days,\" he said. Earlier this week, Mr Giuliani also conceded defeat in his battle with the Brooklyn Museum of Art over its showing of the Sensation exhibition of modern art. The mayor had taken offence at a painting of the Virgin Mary adorned with elephant dung.",

The reality has been very different. We didn't really know what we were doing - a lot of eggs didn't hatch, and a lot of chicks died.\"</p> <p>The breeders' market was soon saturated, and, with birds being sold for slaughter, prices plummeted from \u00a35,000 to just \u00a3250 per head. \"We had got into it without having buyers for the meat, and there were no UK slaughterhouses licensed to deal with ostriches until five years ago,\" says Cook. \"The government was completely unhelpful - there were no grants to help set up.

A lot of people have suffered massive financial problems.\"</p> <p>Cook remains optimistic - although things are fraught at the moment. \"It's the breeding season,\" he says. \"Ostriches are very territorial and run very fast. I've had a couple of narrow escapes. But business is finally picking up.

Tesco pulled both ostrich and kangaroo from their shelves 18 months ago. Spokesman Alan McLaughlin says, \"They did well to start with because of all the publicity about BSE, but sales soon fell off as beef bounced back.

Or tuck into something more substantial at lunchtime, be it homity pie, or lentil and cumin pastie or vegetable pastie for \u00a33.05, a spinach turnover, or jacket potatoes with vegetable curry (a princely \u00a32.85) and mushroom bordelaise.

His mother was a singer. Bruce was shunted around a number of boarding schools, finishing his education at Bedales. Somewhere on the way, aged about 14, he first met Lucian Freud, who became a life-long friend. </p> <p>He went on to St Martin's School of Art, but left, drifting round the corner to Soho, in the 1950s the most cosmopolitan and lively part of London. He worked as a scene-shifter and in sporadic white-collar jobs, but most of all he found his milieu among artists and writers, meeting Francis Bacon for the first time in 1949. </p> <p>He went on, by a devious, accidental route, to become picture editor for a part-work, the History Of the 20th Century, for Purnell. He moved to the Sunday Times magazine as picture researcher in 1972, soon becoming picture editor, a post he held until 1980. Here, he produced Photodiscovery, a personal history of the photograph, which became a much-sought-after book. </p> <p>His eye for photographs, and his belief that the photographic image was at least the equal of the paintings he admired, led him to have the best, and most analytic, response to photography I have encountered. </p> <p>He had a shrewd, passsionate eye, and was possessed of one of the most acute bullshit detectors I have ever encountered. For a long time, I was a bit afraid of him. In the early 1980s, we lived in the same house beside the British Museum, and at first I was more aware of the sounds of nightly pacing, and Beethoven booming through the floorboards, than of the near-invisible Bruce. </p> <p>One night I ended up in his room, filled with photographs, Lucian Freud etchings and piles of books. We'd drink, and he'd stand in the centre of the room, arms to his side - just as Freud has him in his later portraits - Britten and Pears's setting of William Blake's Rose Thou Art Sick booming round the room. </p> <p>Having left the Sunday Times, Bernard went on to be picture editor for the Independent magazine, then in its heyday, and worked on a marvellous book about Van Gogh, Vincent By Himself, which juxtaposed Van Gogh's paintings and drawings with excerpts from the letters to Theo Van Gogh, and a book about paintings of the Virgin Mary. His short articles (often produced pseudonymously - Joe Hodges and Deirdre Pugh being favourite monikers) were terse, unaffected by art or photography jargon and, in the manner of the painters he admired, hard-won. </p> <p>He travelled, he disappeared to his studio (from whence, no paintings or drawings ever emerged), he continued to drink in Soho and to chronicle, in photography, the life about him - and, in particular, his friendships with Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Michael Andrews and Freud, with whom he sometimes used to breakfast at the Savoy. Yet it would be a mistake to see Bernard as a figure whose life was bounded by Soho. I discovered he was a great friend both of Don McCullin, and also of Robert Mapplethorpe. His curiosity about images, whatever their source, whatever their medium, was voracious, critical and driven by a passionate understanding of their power. </p> <p>Bernard was sometimes depicted, in Michael Heath's hilarious and bitter Private Eye cartoon chronicle of Soho barflies, the Regulars, as Napoleon. He could be dismissive, curmudgeonly, not so much difficult as impossible. At the same time, his silent presence could be immensely reassuring in times of difficulty, and his enthusiasm for what he believed in was truly infectious. He had huge fallings-out - notably with Francis Bacon, about whom Bruce was making a book shortly before the artist's death. Suddenly, for no good reason, Bacon pulled the plug. He also fell out with his brother, Jeffrey; it was a continuing theme of their relationship. </p> <p>As well as compiling the definitive survey of the work of George Rodger, co-founder of Magnum, and curating an exhibition of the work of photographer John Deakin for the Victoria and Albert Museum, Bernard went on to curate a photographic exhibition for the Barbican gallery in 1994 and to show his own photographs. His portraits of Leigh Bowery and Lucian Freud (about whom he produced an excellent, image-based monograph), Francis Bacon in the studio doorway, Euan Uglow trapped by the string sight-lines which measure the space of his studio, are incredibly powerful.
