Hartson, who has been linked with a move to virtually every club in Britain except Grimsby in the past fortnight, forced Danny Coyne into two early saves and probably should have scored with the first. His strike partner Jason Euell, another multi-million pound man, had a header stopped before the pair got their angles right. Euell's ball sent Hartson into the area and the Welshman crossed for Euell to tap in. The Wimbledon fans were just getting over that Euell-tide cheer when the second arrived just before half-time, Trond Andersen heading in Par Karlsson's corner. Neal Ardley was given a chance to increase Wimbledon's lead not long after the interval but shot wide from just outside the area, and Damien Francis should certainly have scored in the 56th minute. From Euell's excellent cross, though, he glanced a header wide. The 21-year-old was to pay for that. Two minutes later a neat Grimsby move sent Stuart Campbell scampering down the left wing and from his low cross Nielsen, on loan from Copenhagen, scored emphatically. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

But this is also a transitional time for the videogame industry, with older machines reaching the end of their natural lifespan and two major new consoles arriving next year. </p> <p>So buyers must also consider how much juice is likely to be left in the box they choose. The Nintendo 64 (\u00a374.99) is a case in point. Though technically superior to its rival PlayStation, it has always suffered from a lack of software support. </p> <p>Even now, it can boast no top-flight beat-'em-ups or driving games. Yet if its back catalogue is small, it is also glorious: Goldeneye, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, Wave Race. </p> <p>Like its predecessor the SNES, the N64 has been bowing out in style this year, with the flawed but impressive Perfect Dark, the wonderful Mario Tennis, and now the latest masterpiece from Japanese legend Shigeru Miyamoto, Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. </p> <p>Those who already own the machine will be more than happy, but only die-hard Pok\u00e9mon nuts - Pok\u00e9mon Stadium and Pok\u00e9mon Snap aren't available for any other console - will actually go out and buy one for the first time now. </p> <p>What of Nintendo's old rival? Sony's PSone (\u00a379.99) is a repackaged version of the original PlayStation, in a smaller, rounded white box, and with a snap-on LCD screen promised for next year. The PlayStation is now cheap enough to be a toy. But the technology inside it is still five years old, and showing its age with warped textures and coughing framerates. </p> <p>There is of course a new Lara Croft vehicle out this Christmas (Tomb Raider Chronicles), but there will be no more ground-breaking games on this format. The back catalogue, even so, is wide and impressive, with such benchmarks as Gran Turismo, Metal Gear Solid, Tekken 3, Time Crisis et al available at reduced prices. </p> <p>Since PSone's technology is now so well understood and relatively cheap to develop for, the console might yet enjoy an Indian summer as the medium for inexpensive, experimental videogames, such as this autumn's bizarrely fascinating Vib Ribbon, or the new Incredible Crisis. </p> <p>Gamers looking for the cutting edge, however, will know it is time to move on. I only hope there are not too many tearful children on Christmas morning unwrapping one of these when they wanted a PlayStation 2. Beware of tragic parental confusion. </p> <p>So should you go for a PlayStation 2 (\u00a3299)? It's kind of a moot point, since Sony managed to ship only 165,000 of the beasts to the UK. If you haven't already got one, you won't officially be able to buy one until well into the new year - but there are some enterprising companies out there offering to sell mysteriously acquired machines at a premium. </p> <p> The PS2 is certainly a sleek and sexy beast: ribbed black, with understated highlights, it resembles a serious slab of hi-fi entertainment gear. It also plays back DVD movies, although the quality is not stunning. </p> <p>Connectivity-wise, it's pretty future-proof: USB and i.Link ports, a promised broadband internet adapter, a promised slot-in hard drive. But it's criminal that Sony has provided only two controller ports, forcing you to spend an extra \u00a330 on a multitap to play three-way or four-way games. </p> <p>So what can you play on it? There's the rub. Of all the games available from now until the new year, the only \"must-have\" product is Timesplitters (Eidos). Programmed by Free Radical Design, who were part of the original Goldeneye design team, it's an uproarious first-person shooter with a beautifully fast and smooth four-player mode. </p> <p>Because PS2 is backward-compatible with original PlayStation software, it has a ready-made library of old games, but it will take a while before developers exploit the full potential of its idiosyncratic computing architecture. That might not happen, in fact, before next autumn's Metal Gear Solid 2, a game already so desirable that a five-minute DVD trailer for it has been selling like hot sak\u00e9 in Japan. </p> <p>But by that time, Sony will have to fend off the twin challenges of Microsoft's Xbox (currently selling itself on unproven polygon numbers) and Nintendo's Gamecube (wisely not claiming any numbers at all). </p> <p>My guess is that it will do just fine, once the price is cut to something more sensible, but for now only gadget freaks really need one. </p> <p>And so we come to Sega's Dreamcast (\u00a3149). It had some teething troubles when it launched a year ago: notably, the slipping of high-profile games and the failure of its internet service. But since then, things have started to go right. </p> <p>It is still the only console to ship with a built-in modem, albeit a slow 33.3kbps model (a 56k unit is promised next year), and so out of the box it can function as a basic email and web-browsing unit. Owners of the excellent Dreamcast port of Quake III: Arena can participate in multiplayer fragging contests online as well. </p> <p>Despite the PS2 hype, the Dreamcast has always been a very capable 128-bit machine itself, and its software catalogue is now superb. The evergreen Soul Calibur is still eye-searingly beautiful; there are perfect conversions of Sega arcade games such as House of the Dead 2 and Crazy Taxi; and recent major launches such as Metropolis Street Racer, Jet Set Radio and Shenmue, as well as the delicious maraca-shaking party game Samba de Amigo, have consolidated its position. </p> <p>Dreamcast is by no means certain to be blown out of the water by the new boys next Christmas either. Consider also that current high-street bundles around the \u00a3149 mark offer the console with two or three free games, and that for \u00a3299 or less you can also get it with an excellent multi-region DVD player (the Encore DV-450S), and there is really no contest. Sega is the undisputed champion for videogamers this Christmas. </p> <p>\u0095 Steve Poole is the author of Trigger Happy: The Inner Life of Videogames (Fourth Estate, \u00a312)</p>",

I only hope there are not too many tearful children on Christmas morning unwrapping one of these when they wanted a PlayStation 2. Beware of tragic parental confusion. So should you go for a PlayStation 2 (\u00a3299)? It's kind of a moot point, since Sony managed to ship only 165,000 of the beasts to the UK. If you haven't already got one, you won't officially be able to buy one until well into the new year - but there are some enterprising companies out there offering to sell mysteriously acquired machines at a premium. The PS2 is certainly a sleek and sexy beast: ribbed black, with understated highlights, it resembles a serious slab of hi-fi entertainment gear. It also plays back DVD movies, although the quality is not stunning. Connectivity-wise, it's pretty future-proof: USB and i.Link ports, a promised broadband internet adapter, a promised slot-in hard drive. But it's criminal that Sony has provided only two controller ports, forcing you to spend an extra \u00a330 on a multitap to play three-way or four-way games. So what can you play on it? There's the rub. Of all the games available from now until the new year, the only \"must-have\" product is Timesplitters (Eidos). Programmed by Free Radical Design, who were part of the original Goldeneye design team, it's an uproarious first-person shooter with a beautifully fast and smooth four-player mode. Because PS2 is backward-compatible with original PlayStation software, it has a ready-made library of old games, but it will take a while before developers exploit the full potential of its idiosyncratic computing architecture. That might not happen, in fact, before next autumn's Metal Gear Solid 2, a game already so desirable that a five-minute DVD trailer for it has been selling like hot sak\u00e9 in Japan. But by that time, Sony will have to fend off the twin challenges of Microsoft's Xbox (currently selling itself on unproven polygon numbers) and Nintendo's Gamecube (wisely not claiming any numbers at all). My guess is that it will do just fine, once the price is cut to something more sensible, but for now only gadget freaks really need one. And so we come to Sega's Dreamcast (\u00a3149). It had some teething troubles when it launched a year ago: notably, the slipping of high-profile games and the failure of its internet service. But since then, things have started to go right. It is still the only console to ship with a built-in modem, albeit a slow 33.3kbps model (a 56k unit is promised next year), and so out of the box it can function as a basic email and web-browsing unit. Owners of the excellent Dreamcast port of Quake III: Arena can participate in multiplayer fragging contests online as well. Despite the PS2 hype, the Dreamcast has always been a very capable 128-bit machine itself, and its software catalogue is now superb. The evergreen Soul Calibur is still eye-searingly beautiful; there are perfect conversions of Sega arcade games such as House of the Dead 2 and Crazy Taxi; and recent major launches such as Metropolis Street Racer, Jet Set Radio and Shenmue, as well as the delicious maraca-shaking party game Samba de Amigo, have consolidated its position. Dreamcast is by no means certain to be blown out of the water by the new boys next Christmas either. Consider also that current high-street bundles around the \u00a3149 mark offer the console with two or three free games, and that for \u00a3299 or less you can also get it with an excellent multi-region DVD player (the Encore DV-450S), and there is really no contest. Sega is the undisputed champion for videogamers this Christmas. \u0095 Steve Poole is the author of Trigger Happy: The Inner Life of Videogames (Fourth Estate, \u00a312)",

      "body": "<p>hi ! <br> Having sacrificed breakfast to write my weekly report last week, I returned to Team Commonwealth van (I objected to the name Team Ozzie) to complete the long trip to Banff. It was so cold that the water in the van had frozen - we were all anticipating cold times ahead. </p> <p>Lake Louise was one of our first major places to visit. It looks like a postcard, with the Rockies huge and snowy behind it. The lake itself was totally frozen so we (that is, me, Ange, Nic, Lisa and Hayden) ice-skated across it (<a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery/0,8563,399240,00.html\">look at the picture gallery</a>) in trainers until our feet went numb and we had to go into the hotel to thaw out. </p> <p>Carrying on to Banff, the town itself is as beautiful as Louise was. However, the cost of living in Banff is very high. We stayed at the HI Banff, which for the price had none of the atmosphere or even facilities of Vancouver's Global Village. In the evening we went looking for a good spot to drink and ended up in an Irish-style pub. We met some total oddballs from Quebec, but had an ok evening anyhow. </p> <p>The next day I did start to wonder whether Banff had been a good idea. It was expensive, freezing, and I still had to return to Vancouver. I blame my morning's mood on excess drinking, because I soon realised that if I hadn't come I would have regretted it - after all, I still plan to see everywhere if possible! </p> <p>That afternoon myself and Lisa booked a snowboarding lesson for the next morning. Feeling more positive, I had a home-cooked meal of spag bol - courtesy of Nic, and an early night. </p> <p>Our boarding lesson the next morning was pretty early, and we managed to get there late, but it didn't matter. This is the first time I'd ever been boarding, and everybody had warned me it would be a painful day! Not to mention that it was now -20C outside, which is cold enough to get frostbite. The lesson was pretty frustrating, as I spent half of it falling on my arse, but I was determined to get the hang of it. After lunch and a rest I went back up the hill, and though I can't claim that I got good, I certainly got better, and had a lot of fun along with it (<a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery/0,8563,399240,00.html\">look at the picture gallery</a>). </p> <p>In the evening we had our last 'family' outing to the pub, as I had decided to return to Vancouver for my last week in Canada, Lisa was off to Toronto and Nic and Ange had found jobs. They managed to get work in just two days - I would definitely say have a visa if you want to work in Banff. </p> <p>That evening at the pub I had a mini panic, because the ATM there refused to accept my visa. Although we reckoned on it being a temporary problem, Nic said she'd pay my part of the car hire cost, and I could give it to her parents when I got to Sydney. There you go - that's a pretty public IOU! </p> <p>The night bus back to Vancouver was long, and I was sat next to a kid who'd been booted out of school and home, and was in the midst of a 92-hour journey to California! Everyone I meet seems to have a story to tell - there are so many weird and wonderful people round the world.</p> <p>When I returned to the Global Village hostel on Monday morning I had every intention of resting. Which I should of known never happens! I met an Aussie named Will after five minutes, who introduced me to the delights of peanut butter and banana on toast (it really is incredibly good). He put the idea of working for Fox Studios at Sydney into my head, then he invited me to meet up with a friend of his who worked at CBC (the Canadian equivalent of BBC) for lunch. In the end we met up with two others, Yanick and Jacques, who were lovely men from Quebec. The four of us had lunch and discussed the differences between English and Canadian TV, freedom of broadcasting etc. So I have had some intelligent conversation since I left home! </p> <p>In the afternoon Will and I went to Deep Cove, which is basically a crystal clear lake backed by the mountains. We had eggnog latte and banana cake for dinner, and then went to The Roxy, which is a terrible club, its only virtue being that it's free if you're from the hostel, and you get a free beer (which wins us over every time). </p> <p>I took a trip to Granville Island the next day with Ken, an English hosteller. Someone has written asking for my opinion on the best beer at the brewery, so I felt it was my duty to find out! The tour itself was small but intimate - as Ken and I were the only two on it. The guide, Larney was lovely - he really knew his beer. And for the record, their best two are unquestionably honey lager, and their seasonal Christmas ale. </p> <p>Now with five days left in Vancouver I've decided to go to Victoria Island tomorrow. It was a wrestle between my want and my wallet, but in the end my desire to see the place, and the many recommendations I've received won, so I'll be up early!! </p> <p>Until next week (when I may finally be warmer), <br>Milly</p>",

      "bodyText": "hi ! Having sacrificed breakfast to write my weekly report last week, I returned to Team Commonwealth van (I objected to the name Team Ozzie) to complete the long trip to Banff. It was so cold that the water in the van had frozen - we were all anticipating cold times ahead. Lake Louise was one of our first major places to visit. It looks like a postcard, with the Rockies huge and snowy behind it. The lake itself was totally frozen so we (that is, me, Ange, Nic, Lisa and Hayden) ice-skated across it (look at the picture gallery) in trainers until our feet went numb and we had to go into the hotel to thaw out. Carrying on to Banff, the town itself is as beautiful as Louise was. However, the cost of living in Banff is very high. We stayed at the HI Banff, which for the price had none of the atmosphere or even facilities of Vancouver's Global Village. In the evening we went looking for a good spot to drink and ended up in an Irish-style pub. We met some total oddballs from Quebec, but had an ok evening anyhow. The next day I did start to wonder whether Banff had been a good idea. It was expensive, freezing, and I still had to return to Vancouver. I blame my morning's mood on excess drinking, because I soon realised that if I hadn't come I would have regretted it - after all, I still plan to see everywhere if possible! That afternoon myself and Lisa booked a snowboarding lesson for the next morning. Feeling more positive, I had a home-cooked meal of spag bol - courtesy of Nic, and an early night. Our boarding lesson the next morning was pretty early, and we managed to get there late, but it didn't matter. This is the first time I'd ever been boarding, and everybody had warned me it would be a painful day! Not to mention that it was now -20C outside, which is cold enough to get frostbite. The lesson was pretty frustrating, as I spent half of it falling on my arse, but I was determined to get the hang of it. After lunch and a rest I went back up the hill, and though I can't claim that I got good, I certainly got better, and had a lot of fun along with it (look at the picture gallery). In the evening we had our last 'family' outing to the pub, as I had decided to return to Vancouver for my last week in Canada, Lisa was off to Toronto and Nic and Ange had found jobs. They managed to get work in just two days - I would definitely say have a visa if you want to work in Banff. That evening at the pub I had a mini panic, because the ATM there refused to accept my visa. Although we reckoned on it being a temporary problem, Nic said she'd pay my part of the car hire cost, and I could give it to her parents when I got to Sydney. There you go - that's a pretty public IOU! The night bus back to Vancouver was long, and I was sat next to a kid who'd been booted out of school and home, and was in the midst of a 92-hour journey to California! Everyone I meet seems to have a story to tell - there are so many weird and wonderful people round the world. When I returned to the Global Village hostel on Monday morning I had every intention of resting. Which I should of known never happens! I met an Aussie named Will after five minutes, who introduced me to the delights of peanut butter and banana on toast (it really is incredibly good). He put the idea of working for Fox Studios at Sydney into my head, then he invited me to meet up with a friend of his who worked at CBC (the Canadian equivalent of BBC) for lunch. In the end we met up with two others, Yanick and Jacques, who were lovely men from Quebec. The four of us had lunch and discussed the differences between English and Canadian TV, freedom of broadcasting etc. So I have had some intelligent conversation since I left home! In the afternoon Will and I went to Deep Cove, which is basically a crystal clear lake backed by the mountains. We had eggnog latte and banana cake for dinner, and then went to The Roxy, which is a terrible club, its only virtue being that it's free if you're from the hostel, and you get a free beer (which wins us over every time). I took a trip to Granville Island the next day with Ken, an English hosteller. Someone has written asking for my opinion on the best beer at the brewery, so I felt it was my duty to find out! The tour itself was small but intimate - as Ken and I were the only two on it. The guide, Larney was lovely - he really knew his beer. And for the record, their best two are unquestionably honey lager, and their seasonal Christmas ale. Now with five days left in Vancouver I've decided to go to Victoria Island tomorrow. It was a wrestle between my want and my wallet, but in the end my desire to see the place, and the many recommendations I've received won, so I'll be up early!! Until next week (when I may finally be warmer), Milly",

The reason is that Father Christmas is a Macroscopic Quantum Object.</p> <p>Let me explain. It is a feature of the quantum world that particles - such as electrons - can be in more than one place at a time, provided that nobody is watching. In a famous experiment known as the \"two-slit\" test, physicists have been able to fire a single particle at an opaque plate with two separate slits in it. The diffraction pattern seen on the other side of the slits suggests that the particle passes through both holes at once and interacts with itself. However, if detectors are placed at the slits, to see which slit the particle passes through, the diffraction pattern disappears, and the particle can be seen to pass through either one slit or the other, but not both.</p> <p>The key lies in the fact of observation. Provided that nobody seeks to measure the effect with more than a certain amount of precision, the particle keeps all its options open. But if someone looks too closely, the particle makes its choice. In the language of physics, its quantum wavefunction collapses.</p> <p>Now, let's think of Father Christmas as a particle, obeying the rules of the quantum world. Following the logic of the two-slit experiment, it is perfectly possible for him to visit all the good children of the world simultaneously, provided that he does so unseen. If he is spotted, his wavefunction will collapse and he will be revealed as your Dad with a comedy beard after all. The quantum nature of Father Christmas explains the taboo against seeing him do his job - which Dawkins does not explain.</p> <p>But there's more. It is possible to object that Father Christmas is far too large, rubicund and jolly to be a particle. In the real-life, macroscopic world of people, elves and flying reindeer, the quantum behaviour of each of the squillions of particles from which we are made averages out, so what we see is the everyday phenomenon of causes preceding effects, and people who can never be in two places at once.</p> <p>Cynics might attribute this last consequence to the deficiencies of Railtrack, but it is a fact that real people, even bearded men with red hats and big boots, tend to be found in discrete locations, irrespective of whether they are being watched or not.</p> <p>This objection doesn't wash, however, because it is possible to have macroscopic quantum objects that are larger than single particles. Scientists have managed to choreograph large clusters of atoms to behave as if they were just one particle, in a kind of nanoscopic Busby Berkeley routine.

OK, so neither of these places gets as chilly as absolute zero, but it must count for something that no deserving child would address their wish list to hot places such as, say, Borneo or Brazil.

I am a big Robbie Fowler fan. Always have been, since he burst into the Liverpool side in 1993. Roughly the same age as me, he had all the cheek and the flair I would have liked had I been any good at football. He scored great goals with effortless ease in a league which was otherwise pretty mediocre - an age when Anders Limpar was still considered a luxury player. What's more, he seemed a good laugh, and once wore a politically contentious t-shirt.</p> <p>So watching Robbie last night and, to be honest, over the past couple of years, was like having Father Christmas bludgeoned to death in front of you. Sluggish, slow and with his head constantly down, Robbie looked nothing like the world beater I always thought he would become. He wasn't fast enough to find space and often didn't even attempt to - standing still when he should have been running, hanging back when Emile Heskey needed his support up front.</p> <p>Even more galling was his lack of imagination. I remember Fowler scoring when nobody expected him to. One of his two goals against Aston Villa in the 1996 FA Cup semi-final sticks in the mind: Fowler standing at the right-hand side of the Aston Villa area, looking like crossing the ball, but instead leaning back and with the outside of his golden left foot, curling the ball past Mark Bosnich and inside the far post. He was known at Anfield as God. Last night, Fowler's most creative moment came when he smashed a ball off Steve Finnan in the hope of getting a corner.</p> <p>Whatever happened to the likely lad? Well, there's the usual extenuating circumstances trotted out whenever Fowler is mentioned nowadays. The long periods out through injury, the publicly-denied rumours of cocaine addiction (which persist to this day), the disbanding of the Spice Boys and in particular the departure of best pal Steve McManaman. But that was all supposed to be in the past by now, and with Gerard Houllier nursing \"the most natural finisher in Europe\" back into the first team, we should have seen the old Robbie once more.</p> <p>But the fact is that we haven't. And it's been a long time since we have. Fowler may have only scored five goals this season - including three against Stoke - but his totals over the last three seasons are 13, 18 and four respectively. He has never shown signs of forming a partnership with Michael Owen, who by contrast, pairs up with Heskey as easily as Nicole Appleton with high-profile rock stars. He also looks to be testing the patience of Gerard Houllier, whom Fowler interestingly describes on his website as his \"greatest influence\".</p> <p>I have spent many hours lately wondering what the problem is. Perhaps in the new spangly Premiership, Robbie has become just another player - something I refuse to believe. Perhaps he is just slowly feeling his way back to form, although a year-long cruciate injury didn't slow Roy Keane any. Perhaps, after so long out of touch, he's lost confidence in his ability. Perhaps, despite all the protestations to the contrary, he isn't at ease with Gerard Houllier's new regime and must leave the club to succeed elsewhere. But perhaps we will never actually see the old Robbie again. Perhaps, just perhaps, God is dead.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

He was known at Anfield as God. Last night, Fowler's most creative moment came when he smashed a ball off Steve Finnan in the hope of getting a corner. Whatever happened to the likely lad? Well, there's the usual extenuating circumstances trotted out whenever Fowler is mentioned nowadays. The long periods out through injury, the publicly-denied rumours of cocaine addiction (which persist to this day), the disbanding of the Spice Boys and in particular the departure of best pal Steve McManaman. But that was all supposed to be in the past by now, and with Gerard Houllier nursing \"the most natural finisher in Europe\" back into the first team, we should have seen the old Robbie once more. But the fact is that we haven't. And it's been a long time since we have. Fowler may have only scored five goals this season - including three against Stoke - but his totals over the last three seasons are 13, 18 and four respectively. He has never shown signs of forming a partnership with Michael Owen, who by contrast, pairs up with Heskey as easily as Nicole Appleton with high-profile rock stars. He also looks to be testing the patience of Gerard Houllier, whom Fowler interestingly describes on his website as his \"greatest influence\". I have spent many hours lately wondering what the problem is. Perhaps in the new spangly Premiership, Robbie has become just another player - something I refuse to believe. Perhaps he is just slowly feeling his way back to form, although a year-long cruciate injury didn't slow Roy Keane any. Perhaps, after so long out of touch, he's lost confidence in his ability. Perhaps, despite all the protestations to the contrary, he isn't at ease with Gerard Houllier's new regime and must leave the club to succeed elsewhere. But perhaps we will never actually see the old Robbie again. Perhaps, just perhaps, God is dead. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

For example: he can insouciantly pull his team out of relegation bother without once looking up from the Racing Post; he can effortlessly give post-match interviews while letting his face gently melt to the floor; and he can keep Paolo Di Canio ringfenced from wandering Italian hands - Lazio are alleged to be back in with a \u00a34m bid - while he makes a few tasty deals of his own.</p> <p>You see, Arry's been on the blower to football's Mr Mohair Coat, John Gregory.

He liked having the two jobs and thought he was the luckiest Svennis on earth. On Sundays he would watch Lazio and shout things at the players, and on Wednesday he would meet his friend Tord and ask him whether that Alan Shearer was any good or not. That made Svennis very happy.</p> <p>But not everybody was as happy as Svennis. Sometimes Sergio Cragnotti would get upset when he looked at Lazio's listing on the Italian stock exchange. Sometimes Sergio would think that, despite having spent lots and lots of his hard-earned money, Lazio were not winning enough games. So, one morning, before a very important match with Roma, Sergio went to the Lazio training ground and said: \"This is the most important derby since I became president. The match will be crucial for our season.\" Then Sergio's son Massimo turned up. And he said: \"I hope Eriksson is right when he says all will be right with the team.\"</p> <p>This made Svennis a little scared. He did not want to go to England just yet, he liked the sun in Italy and the FA hadn't had time to sort out his office. So Svennis decided to pretend he wasn't worried about losing his job, and told the men who worked for the newspapers: \"The derby is important, but not decisive.\" The men from the newspapers all laughed, and went off to prepare pages with black borders. Poor little Svennis.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"No one individual is bigger than the club and I will be making that message very clear\" - Aberdeen manager Ebbe Skovdahl trots out the old clich\u00e9, and just as he was about to sign Figo too.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>DAUM TIME</strong></p> <p>Thanks to the power of modern technology, a flight from Orlando, United States, to Bogota, Columbia now takes a mere five hours and 35 minutes. A fact that might just tickle the fancy of Dyson-nosed German manager Christoph Daum - if he wasn't so busy doing something else. Like using his \"new laptop with email access\" to tell \"his fans\" how popular he is, for example. Today Daum - who has been bunkered up in Florida after testing positive for a Siberian winter's worth of cocaine - let it be known that Jesus Gil, the chairman who makes Kuddly Ken Bates seem strangely sane, wants to him to coach Atletico Madrid. </p> <p>\"It is a concrete offer and they want me to join straight away but I have decided to start working again only next summer,\" a nonchalant Daum claimed at 7.19am this morning, just before nicking the last sunbed by his Florida pool. But unfortunately for Daum, Athletico director general Miguel Angel Gil Marin soon rubbished his claims. \"I don't know where this came from, but it is totally false. Nobody has rung Daum,\" he thundered, before undermining himself by insisting that present coach Marcos Alonso still had the \"confidence of Mr Gil\". </p> <p>Even so, the Fiver can't help wondering about Charlie Daum's other claims. Has he really \"never taken drugs in his life\"? Is he really planning to remain in Florida for a while to work on a project to set up a training centre? And, more crucially still, has he really - as he claimed on his personal website yesterday - been offered the job of managing Iran? (\"I am honoured by this offer and I have had several positive experiences with Iranian players.\") The fact is we just don't know any more. And neither, if we're being totally honest, do we care.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Paris Saint Germain chairman Laurent Perp\u00e8re has denied making an \u00a318m bid for Ronaldinho - and has claimed that Leeds have been tracking the Brazilian striker. \"We have approached him, but nothing has been signed. On principle, I am not optimistic for this case and am very cautious,\" said Perp\u00e8re. \"But you have to know, the Brazilian side already refused a 500m Francs [\u00a346m] offer from Leeds!\"</p> <p>Arsene Wenger is interested in Carlisle striker Scott Dobie, according to the Star - but the Third Division side want \u00a31m for him.</p> <p>Another Arsenal target, Czech international Tomas Rosicky, has declared he wants to join Bayern Munich. \"I would like very much to play for Bayern,\" the 20-year-old, who scored for Sparta Prague against Arsenal in Big Cup this season, told German magazine Kicker.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Matthew Jones hopes to emulate the success of Neil Lennon after completing a \u00a33m move from Leeds to Leicester today. \"I am very proud to say that I am the new number seven at Leicester,\" he admitted. \"To be given Lennon's shirt is a great honour for me and I've now got to go and show the fans that I can do his job.\"</p> <p>Joe Cole has rubbished rumours that he will shortly be leaving West Ham. \"I fell in love with West Ham when I was 12 and don't ever want to leave. There's no chance of me leaving, I don't even think about it.\" the 19-year-old said today.</p> <p>Lucas Radebe has agreed to a new deal with Leeds that will see him end his playing career at Elland Road.</p> <p>Nigel Worthington has been told he has \"weeks rather than months\" to prove he is the right man to take the manager's job at Norwich on a permanent basis. Meanwhile Arsenal midfielder Paolo Vernazza has turned down a \u00a3500,000 move to the Canaries while central defender Craig Fleming has signed a new two-year contract with the club.</p> <p>A Frankfurt state prosecutor today called for a suspended jail term of 18 months for Ghanaian striker Tony Yeboah, who is facing tax evasion charges.</p> <p>Former Danish international Brian Laudrup has dismissed media reports that he is planning a comeback. \"The story is an overblown balloon,\" Laudrup told Copenhagen daily newspaper Politiken.</p> <p>Jack Cowan, Dundee's left-back from the League Cup winning team of 1951, has died after a long illness.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>ITV: World Football (3.20am) Wasn't this on last night?</p> <p>Channel 4: Football Italia (2.50am) And this?</p> <p>Channel 5: Jonathan Pearce's Football Night (11.55pm) We're pretty sure this wasn't though.

Although people have traditionally left urban areas for the countryside when they have finished their working lives, this trend is forecast to increase as people live longer and enjoy a greater affluence. The map shows that over the next 20 years, rural areas will tend to have much older populations than urban areas. The main reason for this is migration. Young people tend to migrate to cities for economic opportunities and the urban lifestyle. Retired people tend to migrate to rural and coastal areas for the slower more relaxed pace and the natural beauty. In between in suburban areas suits the needs of people in mid-life who have young families. A further migratory factor is that immigrants tend to settle in urban areas and also tend to be younger with children. These general migration patterns, along with a population that is ageing, means that rural and coastal areas will experience the greatest amount of age-related problems. An older population presents many problems including strain on the state earnings related pension scheme, higher healthcare costs and a shortage of working age people. The office for national statistics predicts that the proportion of the population of England over 65 years of age will grow from 15.6% in 2000 to 19.2% by 2021. West Somerset will have the highest proportion of retirement age people in 2021 at 30.7%. This contrasts with Tower Hamlets, where it is expected that slightly less than 9% of the population will be over 65. Although the increase is not as high as other EU countries such as Germany or Italy, it does represent potential problems. These extreme examples highlight the rural/urban split of the ageing population in England. Rural and coastal areas are also characterized by other traits that pose potential problems to older populations. \u0095 Access to basic services such as food shops, banks and post offices is more difficult in rural areas due to a more dispersed population. \u0095 Average distances to these basic services are greater.

Increased levels of immigration will keep the populations of countries like the United States younger as a whole, but as mentioned earlier immigrants overwhelmingly settle in urban areas where populations are already young. Immigration may help solve problems related to national pension schemes but it does not address the problems of local areas with significantly older populations. Since many of the problems of an ageing population relate to access to services innovative ways to improve transport and delivery of services need to be sought. Recent advances in information and communications technologies offer possible solutions to some of these problems. These technologies have the potential to reduce the travel needs of citizens. The internet can offer information services as well as a way in which to purchase and then receive delivery of goods and services direct to peoples' homes.

In an eight-minute transatlantic telephone call from Warwick University - where Mr Blair is speaking with the US president, Bill Clinton - the prime minister said that he personally, and the UK as a whole, would be a good friend and supporter to Mr Bush. Downing Street said that during the conversation, Mr Bush stressed that he was \"very aware of the special relationship\" between Britain and the US. He added that he was pleased that this was the first telephone call he had received from a foreign leader since becoming president-elect. Both leaders looked forward to having a \"very close\" working relationship and agreed they should meet as soon as Mr Bush settled into the job, Downing Street said. Mr Bush \"recalled fondly\" a visit he made to Scotland when he was working in the oil industry, No 10 added. Later, Mr Blair paid a fulsome tribute to Mr Clinton in his speech at Warwick University, describing him as a \"true leader of the western world\". And he added: \"He has been a friend and a counsel to me and many other political leaders right round this world.\" Of Mr Bush, the prime minister said: \"I know he will be a friend of Britain and Europe ... Britain will be a friend to him and America. \"The world needs a strong America and America is strong today, and I'm sure under president-elect Bush it will continue to be so. \"I offer to President Bush, on behalf of a country proud to call itself America's strongest ally, our unwavering support.\" The Texas governor was today attending a morning service of worship and music at an Austin church - his first act as president-elect after his muted victory speech. His adviser Karen Hughes said: \"The governor decided that he wants to start this on a message of prayer and healing,\" A ceremony was scheduled for later today opening the doors of a government-run transition office to the Bush transition team headed by the vice president-elect, Dick Cheney. Opening his speech at the university, Mr Clinton paid tribute to the \"unusual\" friendship between himself and Mr Blair and their respective families. Earlier, Mr Clinton complimented Mr Bush on for the \"generosity\" of his remarks and urged the nation to \"follow vice-president Gore's lead\" and unify behind Mr Bush and his new administration. Mr Clinton, who was up past 3am watching the concession and acceptance speeches from Chequers, Mr Blair's country retreat, invited Mr Bush to the White House during a four-minute phone call. Mr Bush and Mr Gore are to meet on Tuesday in Washington. Mr Clinton said: \"I pledged to president-elect Bush my efforts and the best efforts of every member of our administration for a smooth and successful transition. The president also spoke with Mr Gore. Mr Bush is expected to move quickly to name a White House staff and a prospective cabinet, with top billing going to retired general Colin Powell as the secretary of state. He has already picked Andrew Card, transportation secretary in his father's term, as his White House chief of staff. Talk about it What do you think?

He added: \"We take our responsibilities as an impartial and balanced broadcaster very seriously and decided to broadcast Ask the Prime Minister only after careful consideration.\" Failure to comply with the legally binding ITC directive would be a breach of STV's licence. Tuesday night's Ask the Prime Minister, a 60-minute peak-time Q&amp;A with Tony Blair, has already caused a row south of the border with opposition parties demanding similar coverage from ITV. But ITV argued that Mr Blair was appearing in his capacity as prime minister and not as Labour leader. The broadcaster also said it was not bound by rules governing political impartiality, because Ask the Prime Minister was broadcast outside a general election.",

Real wages grew at 5% a year between the early 80s and mid-90s in east Asia and southeast Asia, countries that were repressive of trade unions in their early stages of development. But the pace of growth led to the expansion of the formal economy at the expense of the informal sector, leading not only to better labour standards but a very considerable expansion of unionisation.</p> <p>Singh and Zammit say that higher labour standards in the south would require faster economic growth and structural change, which would involve measures to reduce poverty and inequality that would include labour market policies. Such a process would be helped if advanced countries themselves were growing faster.</p> <p>Their solution, in short, is one where the burden of economic adjustment falls on creditor as well as debtor nations, where developing countries are given special and preferential treatment in trade agreements, where a floor is put under commodity prices and where controls on the free movement of capital permit more rapid economic expansion.</p> <p>Those who have read the final volume of Robert Skidelsky's three-part biography of John Maynard Keynes (Fighting For Britain, Macmillan, \u00a325) will know that such a scheme was proposed in the build-up to the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, but was rejected in favour of the more limited, and harsher, US alternative. There is a route to people-friendly globlalisation but there is a long struggle ahead. Having the right answers is not enough, because while Britain had the arguments, the Americans had the power.

Those who have read the final volume of Robert Skidelsky's three-part biography of John Maynard Keynes (Fighting For Britain, Macmillan, \u00a325) will know that such a scheme was proposed in the build-up to the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, but was rejected in favour of the more limited, and harsher, US alternative. There is a route to people-friendly globlalisation but there is a long struggle ahead. Having the right answers is not enough, because while Britain had the arguments, the Americans had the power. And that is what counts. The South Centre, Chemin du Champ du Camp d'Anier 17, Case Postale 228, 1211 Geneva 19, Switzerland",

But the supreme court splits by a 5-4 vote along ideological conservative and liberal lines in deciding that new recounts should not be ordered to remedy the problem. Democratic National Committee Chairman Ed Rendell calls for Mr Gore to concede the election, although he later says the vice-president has \"every right\" to review the decision. <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,409734,00.html\">December 11</a><br> The US supreme court hears oral arguments in Bush v Gore.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,409376,00.html\">December 9</a><br> Just hours after several Florida counties started the court-mandated hand recounts, the US supreme court grants Mr Bush's plea to halt them temporarily pending a hearing on his challenge to the recounts. All counting stops. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,409032,00.html\">December 8</a><br> In a stunning reversal of fortune, the Florida supreme court keeps Mr Gore's hopes alive by reversing Judge Sauls and ordering a manual recount of 9,000 disputed votes in Miami-Dade County and any other disputed ballots in other Florida counties. But suits concerning absentee ballots brought by Gore supporters in two Leon County courts in Tallahassee are rejected. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,408373,00.html\">December 7</a><br> The Florida supreme court hears Mr Gore's appeal of Gore v Harris. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,406976,00.html\">December 4</a><br> The US supreme court sets aside the Florida supreme court ruling in the hand-count deadline, giving temporary victory to Mr Bush; Mr Bush also wins when Judge Sauls rejects Mr Gore's suit to challenge Florida's certified result.

The case, Gore v Harris, is assigned to Leon County Circuit Court Judge N Sanders Sauls. The US general services administration, which acts as federal landlord and office manager, refuses to turn over transition office space to the Bush team. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,403440,00.html\">November 26</a><br> Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris certifies Mr Bush as winner of Florida's 25 electoral votes. Mr Bush claims victory and appoints Mr Cheney to head his transition team. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,402836,00.html\">November 24</a><br> The US supreme court agrees to hear arguments in the Bush lawsuit challenging Florida supreme court's decision to allow continued hand counts of votes. Mr Cheney is released from hospital. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,401650,00.html\">November 22</a><br> Officials in Miami-Dade County, the largest of three counties conducting manual vote recounts, abandon the effort, saying they will not meet the November 26 certification deadline. Republican vice-presidential candidate Dick Cheney suffers a slight heart attack. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,401291,00.html\">November 21</a><br> As the court deliberates, hand recounts continue in three Florida counties. In Broward county, Al Gore gains 118 votes, fewer than Democrats had hoped for. Late in the day, the Florida supreme court rules 7-0 that Florida's secretary of state, Katherine Harris, must include the hand recounts in the state's final result: this is the news Al Gore had been hoping for.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,400451,00.html\">November 20</a><br> Republicans and Democrats present their cases to the Florida high court on whether the results of hand recounts should, after all, be included in the final result for Florida. Katherine Harris defends her claim that they should not be. Meanwhile, another judge declares that he lacks authority to call for a revote in Palm Beach.</p> <p> <b>November 19</b><br> Palm Beach county resumes its recount. Early indications suggest that the hand recounts are finding far fewer extra votes than expected for Al Gore. In a string of small court cases, Republican efforts to block the recounts are rejected.</p> <p><b>November 18</b> <br>An unofficial tally of the result including all postal votes puts George W Bush further ahead, with a lead of 930 votes. Democrats put their hope in hand recounts, which are expected to cut into this lead.</p> <p><b>November 17</b><br> The deadline for receipt of overseas postal votes arrives. Florida's secretary of state, Katherine Harris, makes it clear that she expects to declare a final result for the state the next day, regardless of any recounts under way. A local court approves of this decision - to the Democrats' dismay - but later the Florida supreme court blocks Ms Harris from announcing a result until the hand recounts are complete. A Republican appeal to a federal court to halt recounts is also rejected.</p> <p><b>November 16</b><br> At the federal appeals court, Republicans and Democrats battle over the conduct of hand recounts. Meanwhile, a separate case at the Florida supreme court allows Palm Beach and Broward counties to carry on with their recounts - a key victory for Mr Gore. By now there are about 27 court cases under way involving the election.</p> <p><b>November 15</b><br> Katherine Harris applies to the Florida supreme court to block all hand recounts. This application is denied, allowing the recounts to continue - although Ms Harris says she will render them irrelevant by ignoring all hand recounts when she announces the final results, due on November 18. Meanwhile, the Palm Beach recount continues and Broward county decides to conduct a full hand recount. A judge rules that Palm Beach officials can set their own rules on determining which ballot papers are valid - good news for Al Gore.</p> <p><b>November 14</b><br> The Gore move fails when a Florida court upholds Ms Harris's right to enforce the deadline. However, after suspending its hand recount, Palm Beach county votes to resume it the following day, in defiance of the deadline. </p> <p><b>November 13</b><br> The legal move by Mr Bush to block the counts fails, but he gets better news when Florida's secretary of state, Katherine Harris, announces that she will not extend a 5pm EST, November 14 deadline for the final certification of votes in Florida. She announces that she will ignore the results of any hand recounts which miss this deadline. The Gore campaign announce that they will go to court to overturn her decision and protest that Ms Harris is an active Republican and known Bush supporter. </p> <p><b>November 12</b><br> Volusia county and the larger Palm Beach county carry out manual recounts. Since manual counts allow more ballot papers to pass as valid than machine counts, this is good news for Al Gore. George W Bush applies to a federal court to block the counts.</p> <p><b>November 10</b><br> The full machine recount of votes across Florida is declared. Some estimates put Mr Bush ahead of Mr Gore by only 327 votes. </p> <p><b>November 9</b> <br> Confusion reigns. Al Gore demands a hand recount of votes in four largely Democratic counties, including Palm Beach. </p> <p><b>November 8</b><br> At 12am GMT polls close in Florida. Within an hour, Associated Press and major TV networks use exit polls to declare Al Gore the victor in the state. Bush supporters in Austin, Texas, cannot hide their dismay. Mr Gore appears to be on his way to the White House. </p> <p>By 2.30am, actual returns from Florida show Mr Bush is doing better than the exit polls suggested. At 3am, TV networks admit that the Florida result is uncertain and withdraw it from the list of Gore victories. At 7.15am, the networks declare Mr Bush the winner in Florida, and announce that he has won the election. </p> <p>Soon after Mr Gore calls Mr Bush to concede the election. He leaves his headquarters, intending to make a concession speech to his supporters - but on learning that the Republican lead in Florida is suddenly much smaller than expected, he returns to his headquarters and calls Mr Bush to retract his concession.</p> <p>At 9.15am, major television networks withdraw their claim that George W Bush has won the election. Later, final tallies in Florida put Mr Bush ahead by 1,725 votes - close enough to trigger an automatic recount using the scanning machines which normally count votes in Florida.</p> <p>In a development which initially receives lavish attention, it becomes clear that a complex \"butterfly\" ballot paper in one Florida county confused many voters: 19,000 votes in the county are disqualified and others go unexpectedly to Reform candidate Pat Buchanan. This leads to the first of many court cases, when Palm Beach electors demand a revote in their county.

      "bodyText": "New BBC vice-chairman Gavyn Davies is no stranger to being accused of new Labour cronyism in his dealings with the corporation. The Tories levelled exactly this charge against the Goldman Sachs economist last summer, when the government advisory committee he chaired recommended a digital licence fee to meet the BBC's funding needs. The accusation made by the Conservatives was that Mr Davies' new Labour credentials meant his review was not truly independent and the result therefore meaningless, because the chairman had already made up his mind that the BBC should have more money. Mr Davies easily brushed off the criticism, saying the committee produced a \"balanced report, not a new Labour solution\". However, there is no getting away from his close ties to new Labour and in particular chancellor Gordon Brown. Nor is there any doubt about his broad support for the BBC's public service broadcasting remit, or - following his involvement in the funding review last year - his intimate knowledge of the BBC's sprawling media empire and the challenges it faces moving forward into the digital age. Mr Davies' links with the governing party go back to the old Labour days of the 1970s, when he was economic advisor to prime minister Jim Callaghan. These days his wife, Sue Nye, runs Mr Brown's private office. He first set out his views on the future funding of the BBC in a 1997 co-authored essay for a pamphlet commissioned by the corporation, which advocated an increase in the licence fee. But if after reading this tract, BBC insiders were expecting an easy ride in the review of BBC finances that Mr Davies chaired last year, they were in for a shock. Although it accepted some of the BBC's arguments for extra funding, the Davies committee also urged further cost-cutting, the sell-off of BBC Resources, the sale of a minority stake in BBC Worldwide and for the corporation's finances to be opened up to National Audit Office scrutiny. Sir John Birt, then BBC director-general, was certainly not pleased, accusing Mr Davies of authoring an illogical report that threatened the corporation's independence. Long before he was drawn into the highly politicised world of BBC governance and funding, Mr Davies had fashioned a highly successful City career with leading investment bank Goldman Sachs. He rose to become a partner in the firm and its chief international economist. Last summer Mr Davies, along with other senior executives, became seriously rich from share options when Goldman Sachs became the last of the old-school Wall Street investment banks to go public.",

The students get paid \u00a35 a week for six mornings' work, logging in names such as Anatalie Mukasirire. A subsistence farmer aged 34, and the head of a family, she was killed with a machete in April 1994, in her home because of her ethnic group.

Final year students, who pay about 80p a month for a card which gives them an hour's use a day, are writing emails to friends, looking at chess problems, and researching. </p> <p>Computers in Rwanda are used, as in the other room, for assessing the tragedy which struck the country, but also for reconstruction, education, looking forward. The university, along with the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in the Rwandan capital, has the cheapest, fastest internet access in the country, thanks to help from the Leland Initiative, a US scheme to extend internet connections to more than 20 African countries, which has given them a year's free internet access through the VSAT (very small aperture terminal) system. </p> <p>The university has 160 computers now, of which 54 have internet access, and should soon have 250. Most NUR students had never seen the internet before they got here. </p> <p>The new 31-student computer studies department is thriving and looking to expand and the department is planning to rent out the internet access to others in the city, to schools and foreign businessmen and NGO (non-governmental organisation) staff. </p> <p>KIST is doing the same, and even offered free internet access to a cybercafe for six months to help it get on its feet. </p> <p>The Rwandan government has latched on to information and communications technology (ICT) as an engine to deliver what would be a stunning transformation of its economy. \"ICT are offering Rwanda a window of opportunity to leapfrog the key stages of industrialisation and transform her subsistence agriculture dominated economy into a service-sector driven, high value information and knowledge economy that can compete on the global market,\" said the government in February. \"The vision for Rwanda - to be transformed into an information-rich knowledge based society and economy within 20 years.\" </p> <p>Rwanda wants to become what it describes as the Dubai of east Africa, providing low-cost offshore banking, data entry and insurance services for small and medium sized businesses in Europe at a third of the cost, and exploiting the rarity of having both English and French as official languages by offering cheap simultaneous translation services. </p> <p>The vision is born of an assessment as much of Rwanda's weaknesses as its strengths. \"Rwanda has no natural resources. The only resources we have are human beings,\" says Albert Nsengiyumva, the head of NUR's computing centre. \"The only way to promote the country is to provide skills for our people. We need to figure out how Rwanda, without natural resources, can provide some services so that we can improve our economy.\" </p> <p>Landlocked, and with more than 90% of the population working on subsistence farms, Rwanda has hardly any geographic advantages. But if the internet can make geography irrelevant, that gives Rwanda a chance. </p> <p>Claver Gatete, a senior adviser to president Paul Kagame, thinks ICT can also link the country's agrarian base to export markets. Whereas there is no competitive advantage in trying to export low-cost, high-bulk potatoes and bananas, Rwanda could find a market for cheap roses and carnations, for instance. The web can give the country more clout in tourism, by tempting visitors to Dar es Salaam and Mombasa to travel on through to Rwanda. </p> <p>But in a country where six years ago a high proportion of educated and skilled people were killed or exiled, the digital divide is an ocean wide. So education is at the core of the government's ICT strategy. </p> <p> Whereas in the development of the internet in many other countries education has often had to play catch-up with commerce, here it is in at the beginning. The government wants people to be both edu cated to use IT, and educated through IT. The potential shortcuts can be liberating, enabling students to access learning material, even top-quality lecturers, without them having to be imported at great expense. </p> <p>\"The internet means sharing, it means the cheapest way to communicate,\" says Nsengiyumva. \"We need to train people, to sensitise people, how the internet can be useful in a country like Rwanda.\" </p> <p>Britain is doing its bit, with Rwanda one of two lead pilots for the Imfundo project, which will be launched by Tony Blair next year, a government public/private scheme to help developing countries with IT. </p> <p>Imfundo plans to support the development of the Rwanda Education Network (Rednet), linking education institutions with each other and to government offices. But its most ambitious scheme is to help launch an in-service training scheme for the country's 30,000 teachers, 25,000 of whom are untrained. It will develop courses through the Kigali Institute of Education, the main teacher training institution, which will be connected to 10 regional centres. </p> <p>\"We have got far apart from identifying the centres we are going to use,\" says Beatrice Mukabaranga, vice-rector of KIE . \"We feel that if it succeeds it's going to bring dramatic changes.\" </p> <p>The education minister, Emmanuel Mudidi, an enthusiast for decentralisation, sees it as a way of keeping people working within their regions, improving their skills and their earning power without having to rush to the cities. At NUR and KIST, there are already distance learning courses being conducted through the African Virtual University, a World Bank-inspired scheme, mainly delivered through video in Rwanda but with some internet links. But though the radio is the most effective form of communication in Rwanda, and will remain so for years, probably decades, the universities are not interested in running courses that way. </p> <p>But the critical issue for the burgeoning IT industry in Rwanda is how to train people to run it, and how to keep them in the country once they are trained. NUR, KIST and Rwandatel, the state-owned telecommunications company which provides most of the internet access, each sent two people to the University of Maryland in the US recently. NUR also has links with Michigan State University. NUR's lead technician, Clemintine Nsanzineza, is going to Koblenz, Germany, to complete her training. </p> <p>But this is expensive. Just as with the shortage of teachers, Nsengiyumva is looking towards the time when the stabilisers provided by foreign experts are gone. When he came here in 1997 to open the computer centre, he says, \"people were never thinking about training technicians - they were all looking at just equipment. They now see that is a big mistake\". </p> <p>The scale of the vision can seem unlikely. The computers kept crashing at NUR in the summer because the dam producing electricity for the site was hit by a three-month drought. The government has very few computers, and many schools have none. </p> <p>Merithe Nzaramba, head of the FAWE girls school, is very pleased with the four computers they were given by president Paul Kagame and is supportive of the ICT vision.

They reckon the Rwandan government has tapped into the worldwide craze for IT buzzwords; that it has calculated the most effective way to attract investment from abroad, from foreign governments and dot.coms with a conscience.

The Tory leader will call for a restoration of sweeping stop-and-search activities even though they were criticised in the report for being used disproportionately against black people. In a Centre for Policy Studies lecture today, he will claim that Sir William Macpherson's report, with its allegations of institutional racism inside the Metropolitan police, has damaged the morale of the force and contributed to a fall in police numbers in London. Mr Hague will attack the way he claims the Home Office used the report to bring about a reduction in stop-and-search powers in London. The Tory leader is expected to say: \"It is time to take on and defeat the liberal elite who now want us to believe the police are all racist.\" The Met commissioner, Sir John Stevens, has recently claimed that there is a crisis in his service, blaming the fall in police numbers and the \"self-inflicted\" wounds of the Lawrence inquiry. Sir William's criticism of the police for misusing stop-and-search powers was one of the most contentious aspects of his report. Last night Sir William expressed sadness that Mr Hague had chosen to target the report and rejected any suggestion that it had been responsible for damaging morale in the force. \"To say two years after the report that police morale had been damaged is a condemnation not of the report but of the police,\" he said. \"If anyone bothered to read the report they would see that at no point did it recommend a reduction of proper stop-and-search. But of course we were critical of discriminatory stop-and-search.

But it is a neglected matter today, ignored by an opposition instinctively hostile to the minimum wage and quietly side-stepped by a government anxious not to alienate new found friends in business. However, without an uprating mechanism, the value of the minimum wage will be at the mercy of the whims of the political process. </p> <p>Between 1985 and the 1997 general election, the Labour party had an automatic uprating mechanism for the minimum wage, based on the growth of male earnings.

The USA has had a federal minimum wage since 1938. There is no automatic mechanism for increasing it; any increase requires a bill to be passed by Congress and signed into law by the president. Increases are infrequent. </p> <p>The lack of an adequate uprating mechanism has severely diminished its value. As a percentage of average annual hourly wages, from a peak of 56.1% in 1968, it had fallen to 42.3% by 1997. This decline contributed to growing income inequality. The electoral cycle is a more important factor in any increase than the needs of working families. The working poor dependent on minimum wages have their income held captive to the whims of the political process.</p> <p>Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, said: \"Politicians don't want the minimum wage to be indexed because they like to fight over it. Democrats want to show their constituents, like labor, how hard they fight to raise the minimum wage.

The US increases of 1990/91, though staged, were a 27% rise. </p> <p>The virtue of an adequate uprating mechanism is that it should be reasonably predictable, enabling employers to anticipate and plan ahead.

Indeed, an adequate uprating mechanism would encourage stability, certainty and long termism, virtues that the Chancellor has sought in his economic policy.</p> <p>The nature of the uprating mechanism is also important. Tying minimum wage rates to increases in the cost of living defeats the very purpose of indexing the wage floor - to protect the earnings of low-paid workers not only from inflation but also in relation to more highly paid workers. </p> <p>The French minimum wage, the \"salarie minimum interprofessionnel de croissance\" (SMIC), has an approach that is both flexible and more reliable than that of the US. There is a three-fold process of uprating: the minimum wage must rise with prices and with at least half the increase in the real value of average earnings, with provision for an additional annual increase to be made by decree.</p> <p>The effect of this, as noted by the OECD, is that, while in most European countries the value of minimum wages relative to earnings has declined over time, in France \"it has been relatively stable\". The SMIC, which is partially automatic, is rendered adequate by occasional boosts from its non-automatic element, while retaining the flexibility absent from other formulas. </p> <p>The issue of uprating will need addressing soon. The government should look across the Channel rather than the Atlantic for advice. The case for an adequate mechanism that maintains the value of the minimum wage, as the French approach does, is a strong one, as it avoids the pitfalls of other methods. </p> <p>If Labour wins the next general election, there is potential for a new political consensus around an uprating mechanism that an future Conservative government, especially as it now accepts the principle of the minimum wage, might find hard to break. Instead, it could become part of the day-to-day landscape of life, uncontroversial and widely accepted. For low-paid workers this would be a welcome change. </p> <p>\u0095 Sanjiv Sachdev is a senior lecturer in human resource management at Kingston University</p> <p> Feedback: do you agree?

The case for an adequate mechanism that maintains the value of the minimum wage, as the French approach does, is a strong one, as it avoids the pitfalls of other methods. If Labour wins the next general election, there is potential for a new political consensus around an uprating mechanism that an future Conservative government, especially as it now accepts the principle of the minimum wage, might find hard to break. Instead, it could become part of the day-to-day landscape of life, uncontroversial and widely accepted. For low-paid workers this would be a welcome change. \u0095 Sanjiv Sachdev is a senior lecturer in human resource management at Kingston University Feedback: do you agree?

      "body": "<p>One of the most important jobs in US politics is still to be decided - that of US treasury secretary.</p> <p>The economics job in George W Bush's cabinet will be one of the most challenging in Washington. It is also likely to prove one of the most difficult to fill.</p> <p>Imagine the job advertisement: \"Political bruiser needed to privatise social security and cut $1.3 trillion from American taxes. An ability to win support for such controversial policies from a deeply divided Washington would be much appreciated. The successful candidate must be well versed in the ways of business as well as finance; an extraordinary career in either and friends in both are necessary. In addition, he or she should be prepared for the challenges of a recession after a decade of unprecedented growth.\"</p> <p>The last qualification is making Dubya's decision particularly difficult. America's economy, which has performed so spectacularly for his archenemy Bill, is slowing down. The signs are everywhere: thousands of car workers made redundant, internet companies going out of business quicker than you can say dot.com and rapacious lawyers (for whom the president has discovered a new regard) switching over to insolvency work in packs. Such evidence prompted the ever-cheerful Dick Cheney to remark that America \"may well be on the front edge of a recession\" last weekend.</p> <p>Marshall Whittman, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, says the appointment of a treasury secretary is a key one for a Bush. \"One of the great frustrations for his father was that he never got the credit for the recovery. The son now really doesn't want to take the blame for the recession.\"</p> <p>George W's decision has been made more difficult, however, by the lack of a true front runner for the job. Larry Lindsay, the avid supply-sider who has served as the Bush campaign's adviser on economic issues, was once the obvious choice. However, the former central bank governor and academic has recently been tipped for a job inside the White House rather than in the separate treasury department. His relatively weak links to Wall Street are seen by some Beltway observers as one of the reasons for this.</p> <p>This is partly because of the success of Robert Rubin, the former co-head of the investment bank Goldman Sachs and Clinton's first treasury secretary. His handling of the Mexican peso crisis and partnership with Alan Greenspan, the revered head of the Federal Reserve Board, in managing the astonishing resurgence of the US economy made Rubin a tough act to follow. Larry Summers, the present incumbent, faced some objections to his succession even though he was Rubin's choice.</p> <p>So who are the contenders for the top job? While George W has made much of his desire to increase diversity with his choice of a cabinet, there are no women or minorities on the list of those thought most likely to be the next treasury secretary.

      "bodyText": "One of the most important jobs in US politics is still to be decided - that of US treasury secretary. The economics job in George W Bush's cabinet will be one of the most challenging in Washington. It is also likely to prove one of the most difficult to fill. Imagine the job advertisement: \"Political bruiser needed to privatise social security and cut $1.3 trillion from American taxes. An ability to win support for such controversial policies from a deeply divided Washington would be much appreciated. The successful candidate must be well versed in the ways of business as well as finance; an extraordinary career in either and friends in both are necessary. In addition, he or she should be prepared for the challenges of a recession after a decade of unprecedented growth.\" The last qualification is making Dubya's decision particularly difficult. America's economy, which has performed so spectacularly for his archenemy Bill, is slowing down. The signs are everywhere: thousands of car workers made redundant, internet companies going out of business quicker than you can say dot.com and rapacious lawyers (for whom the president has discovered a new regard) switching over to insolvency work in packs. Such evidence prompted the ever-cheerful Dick Cheney to remark that America \"may well be on the front edge of a recession\" last weekend. Marshall Whittman, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, says the appointment of a treasury secretary is a key one for a Bush. \"One of the great frustrations for his father was that he never got the credit for the recovery. The son now really doesn't want to take the blame for the recession.\" George W's decision has been made more difficult, however, by the lack of a true front runner for the job. Larry Lindsay, the avid supply-sider who has served as the Bush campaign's adviser on economic issues, was once the obvious choice. However, the former central bank governor and academic has recently been tipped for a job inside the White House rather than in the separate treasury department. His relatively weak links to Wall Street are seen by some Beltway observers as one of the reasons for this. This is partly because of the success of Robert Rubin, the former co-head of the investment bank Goldman Sachs and Clinton's first treasury secretary. His handling of the Mexican peso crisis and partnership with Alan Greenspan, the revered head of the Federal Reserve Board, in managing the astonishing resurgence of the US economy made Rubin a tough act to follow. Larry Summers, the present incumbent, faced some objections to his succession even though he was Rubin's choice. So who are the contenders for the top job? While George W has made much of his desire to increase diversity with his choice of a cabinet, there are no women or minorities on the list of those thought most likely to be the next treasury secretary. There have been a few Democrats touted, notably the incumbent Summers, but few believe that Bush will entrust such a tough job to a member of the Gore camp. Most pundits believe a Wall Street insider will be chosen. The problem is that there are question marks over all the most likely contenders: Donald Marron, the head of PaineWebber, a US brokerage firm that was taken over by the Swiss bank UBS this summer; Walter Shipley, the retired chairman of Chase Manhattan; and John Hennessy, a former junior member of the Nixon administration who is now at Credit Suisse First Boston. While these men have been ardent fundraisers for Bush, they are not known for the sort of charm and pizzazz helpful for such a tough job. It is whispered that Dubya would not recognise them at a party. Another choice could be Ted Forstmann, the New York billionaire financier. His liaison with Liz Hurley would provide a little glamour at least. Yesterday, the Bush campaign team was trying to maintain a dignified silence on his cabinet \"out of respect for the vice-president\". But the choice of US treasury secretary, difficult though it is, is likely to be announced before Christmas. It would be fun to think that someone exciting will fall out of the cracker, but don't hold your breath.

Sir David selected his post-Watergate grilling of President Nixon as the highlight of the collection. It drew a record global audience for a news interview. \"That interview ranks as the most important, and we had to take so many risks to get it,\" said Sir David. Ever since he began his TV career in the 1960s, the world-famous journalist has kept hold of the rights to his shows through his Paradine production company. Sir David has made millions over the years from TV production, film-making, book writing and other investments. Newsplayer plans to put the clips on DVD and syndicate them to other websites and internet service providers. Sir David, 61, rose to fame with the satirical 1960s BBC programme That Was The Week That Was, which drew regular complaints from offended politicians. The Frost Report soon followed, and is best known for starting the careers of Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett, aka The Two Ronnies, and John Cleese. He went on to become a journalistic star on both sides of the Atlantic, attracting the rich, famous and powerful to the interview sofa.

The leader-writer echoes the self-congratulation which has pervaded the election saga: \"It's been said, and it's worth repeating, that we had a bitterly contested election that essentially ended in a tie, but there were no soldiers taking over the streets, no general or colonel assuming control of the country. Our differences were settled in a court of law according to the time-honored institutions, often-tested rules and governing traditions of our nation. Once again the Constitution, the collected wisdom of the Founders, has met the test of democracy.\"</p> <p>The leader writer of the <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/\" target=\"_NEW\"> Minneapolis Star Tribune</a> leaves little doubt about where the paper's heart lies: \"Vice President Al Gore was magnificent Wednesday night. This man whom many deride for being wooden and pedantic was neither. He spoke with conviction, warmth and magnanimity. As he conceded the highest office in the land, an office he believes he won, he gave a masterful talk. Gov. George W. Bush gave an acceptable speech. He was gracious to Gore and to Democrats generally - pledging truly to reach across the chasm now separating the two parties in search of bipartisanship. But he went too far, at precisely the wrong time, in promoting his own policy agenda. In doing so, he misjudged the moment.\"</p> <p>In its distinctive staccato style, the tabloid <a href=\"http://www.nypostonline.com\" target=\"_new\">New York Post</a> wishes the president-elect well in setting up his new administration: \"Bush will be refining his agenda, and picking his staff, in the shortest timespan of any incoming president in decades, now that the transition period has been sliced in half. But he mustn't let that serve as an excuse for delay; from the moment he takes office on Jan. 20, the nation - and the world - will be looking for signs of stability and competence at the helm of the planet's sole superpower.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.gopbi.com/partners/pbpost/epaper/editions/today/\" target=\"_new\">Palm Beach Post</a>, which has been at the heart of the Florida recount battle, is still sniffy about the intervention of the US Supreme Court: \" It remains our opinion that the Supreme Court never should have taken this case.

      "byline": "Kirsty Regan",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Unison Scotland</strong><br> Unison's Scottish Organiser for Health, Jim Devine said: \"This document is the start of the re-nationalisation of the Scottish health service. The internal market the Tories introduced brought nothing but conflict, confusion and competition to the National Health Service in Scotland. This is now at an end. The plan sends a powerful message, that co-operation, co-ordination and comprehensive healthcare is the new priority of this administration.\"</p> <p><strong>Scottish Association of Health Councils</strong><br> Andy Carver, research manager with the Scottish Association of Health Councils, said: \"I'm pleased to say we haven't been abolished. We support the new investment in information for patients. Scotland has been lagging behind what has being going on in England and this will redress the imbalance. The commitment to national standards is both necessary and welcome - now evidence about good quality care will have to be implemented in all areas.\"</p> <p><strong>Scottish National Party</strong><br> Shadow Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon MSP said the government's previous pledge on reducing waiting lists had been omitted from the plan:</p> <p>\"They have already failed to deliver on their key pledge to reduce waiting lists and even worse they have omitted any mention of this pledge in the health plan. It appears therefore the best way to deal with a pledge that they have problems achieving is to remove it from any future publications.\"</p> <p><strong>Scottish Conservative &amp; Unionist Party</strong><br> Scots Tory health spokesperson Mary Scanlon MSP accused health minister Susan Deacon of \"rehashing the same old tired, discredited ideas\".</p> <p>She said: \"I agree with Susan Deacon that the key is implementation. In that case I have to ask the minister why she has produced enough glossy brochures, plans, strategies, reviews consultations and focus group documents to fill an entire library. </p> <p>\"And we can look forward to a cancer plan and a heart disease strategy next year. We wait years for action on top clinical priorities, and the best they can think of to do is publish another document.\"</p> <p><strong>Scottish NHS Confederation</strong><br> Scottish NHS Confederation chairman Caroline Thomson said she would adopt a \"wait and see\" approach to the announcement that NHS trusts and boards are to be amalgamated into unified boards.</p> <p>She said: \"Having several NHS organisations in each area has been confusing for many people. The introduction of unified boards could cause concern that decision making will be too far removed from patients. </p> <p>\"However, we recognise the potential advantage of having a single NHS body in each area with which patients can more readily identify and on which they can have a more direct impact.\"</p> <p><strong>Scottish Royal Colleges</strong><br> Professor Jim Petrie, chairman of the Scottish Royal College, welcomed the \"strong strategic direction\" of the plan but warned that immediate action must be taken on workforce planning.</p> <p>He said: \"Ensuring quality of care across all aspects of the health service will have resource implications for the NHS in Scotland and we will have to find ways of ensuring that staffing levels are of sufficient strength to deliver these objectives whilst ensuring that staff are given time to update their skills and to continue their professional involvement.\"</p> <p> <strong>BMA Scotland public health committee</strong><br> Dr Charles Saunders, chairman of the BMA Scotland's public health committee said: \"Everybody working in the NHS in Scotland will welcome the minister's commitment to reducing the burden imposed by hospital acquired infection. At any one time, one in 10 of all hospital patients suffer from an infection they picked up while in hospital. The consequences of these infections range from a few extra days in hospital to premature death. Up to a third are entirely preventable\"</p> <p><strong>Royal Pharmaceutical Society In Scotland</strong><br> Alison Strath , chairman of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in Scotland, said she was \"delighted\" at the announcement of a pharmacy strategy in the plan.</p> <p>\"What I'm pleased about is the inclusive nature of the announcement and the recognition that the 'NHS family' is not just about doctors and nurses. Statistics tell us that 17% of all admissions to hospital are related to adverse drug reactions. In the Tayside region alone, there are reckoned to be 7,000 tonnes of wasted medicines each year. Through an increased involvement in repeat prescribing, medicine monitoring and reviews, pharmacists can play a key role in improving the quality of the patient journey through the NHS in Scotland.\"</p> <p><strong>The Royal College of Nursing</strong><br> James Kennedy, RCN Scottish board secretary warned that it was important that the plan's pledges and promises \"become reality,\" and that nurses were given a key role in implementing it. </p> <p>\"Nurses provide around 80% of direct patient care so it is vital that the voice of nurses is heard on these new boards. </p> <p>\"No one would contemplate running a school without listening to teachers How can we have a health service that puts the views of directors of finance above directors of nursing?\"</p> <p>He praised the plan's emphasis on family-friendly policies and said it would help with nurse retention, and even attract people back to nursing. </p> <p> <strong>Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA)</strong><br> Rita Miller, COSLA's health spokesperson, was underwhelmed by the lack of emphasis on local government's role in partnership working with the NHS.</p> <p>\"We feel the references to local government are neither strong enough nor specific enough to make us feel that we are equal partners in what must clearly be a joint agenda. </p> <p>\"It is disappointing that, while there are significant proposals for councils - particularly developing them as public health organisations and the inclusion of a local government voice on the new NHS boards - we do not believe that the importance of local government has, as yet, been fully recognised.\"</p> <p><strong>Action on Smoking and Health</strong><br> Maureen Moore, Chief Executive of ASH Scotland, welcomed the plan's commitment to consult on offering nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) via GP prescription as \"a great step forward\".</p> <p>She said: \"Making NRT freely available on prescription is a positive and cost-effective public health measure. Tobacco use kills one in five Scots every year yet, historically, little has been done to help the majority of smokers who wish to quit. </p> <p>\"Many smokers have been deterred from using NRT because of the high cost ,so this is a great step forward. NRT is a safe and effective way of helping smokers to quit and overcome their addiction to nicotine.\"</p> <p> <strong>BMA Scotland</strong><br> The BMA warned that the \"aspirational\" spirit of the proposals needed to be met with \"concerted effort\" from all professions to implement the plan. </p> <p>Dr John Garner, chairman of the Scottish Council of the BMA, said:\"The health plan delivers a clear set of goals for improving healthcare in Scotland and sets out detailed aspirations that are shared by all. The task ahead is to turn the plan's rhetoric into reality and develop practical improvements in patient care.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Unison Scotland Unison's Scottish Organiser for Health, Jim Devine said: \"This document is the start of the re-nationalisation of the Scottish health service. The internal market the Tories introduced brought nothing but conflict, confusion and competition to the National Health Service in Scotland. This is now at an end. The plan sends a powerful message, that co-operation, co-ordination and comprehensive healthcare is the new priority of this administration.\" Scottish Association of Health Councils Andy Carver, research manager with the Scottish Association of Health Councils, said: \"I'm pleased to say we haven't been abolished. We support the new investment in information for patients. Scotland has been lagging behind what has being going on in England and this will redress the imbalance. The commitment to national standards is both necessary and welcome - now evidence about good quality care will have to be implemented in all areas.\" Scottish National Party Shadow Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon MSP said the government's previous pledge on reducing waiting lists had been omitted from the plan: \"They have already failed to deliver on their key pledge to reduce waiting lists and even worse they have omitted any mention of this pledge in the health plan. It appears therefore the best way to deal with a pledge that they have problems achieving is to remove it from any future publications.\" Scottish Conservative &amp; Unionist Party Scots Tory health spokesperson Mary Scanlon MSP accused health minister Susan Deacon of \"rehashing the same old tired, discredited ideas\". She said: \"I agree with Susan Deacon that the key is implementation. In that case I have to ask the minister why she has produced enough glossy brochures, plans, strategies, reviews consultations and focus group documents to fill an entire library. \"And we can look forward to a cancer plan and a heart disease strategy next year. We wait years for action on top clinical priorities, and the best they can think of to do is publish another document.\" Scottish NHS Confederation Scottish NHS Confederation chairman Caroline Thomson said she would adopt a \"wait and see\" approach to the announcement that NHS trusts and boards are to be amalgamated into unified boards. She said: \"Having several NHS organisations in each area has been confusing for many people. The introduction of unified boards could cause concern that decision making will be too far removed from patients. \"However, we recognise the potential advantage of having a single NHS body in each area with which patients can more readily identify and on which they can have a more direct impact.\" Scottish Royal Colleges Professor Jim Petrie, chairman of the Scottish Royal College, welcomed the \"strong strategic direction\" of the plan but warned that immediate action must be taken on workforce planning. He said: \"Ensuring quality of care across all aspects of the health service will have resource implications for the NHS in Scotland and we will have to find ways of ensuring that staffing levels are of sufficient strength to deliver these objectives whilst ensuring that staff are given time to update their skills and to continue their professional involvement.\" BMA Scotland public health committee Dr Charles Saunders, chairman of the BMA Scotland's public health committee said: \"Everybody working in the NHS in Scotland will welcome the minister's commitment to reducing the burden imposed by hospital acquired infection. At any one time, one in 10 of all hospital patients suffer from an infection they picked up while in hospital. The consequences of these infections range from a few extra days in hospital to premature death. Up to a third are entirely preventable\" Royal Pharmaceutical Society In Scotland Alison Strath , chairman of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in Scotland, said she was \"delighted\" at the announcement of a pharmacy strategy in the plan. \"What I'm pleased about is the inclusive nature of the announcement and the recognition that the 'NHS family' is not just about doctors and nurses. Statistics tell us that 17% of all admissions to hospital are related to adverse drug reactions. In the Tayside region alone, there are reckoned to be 7,000 tonnes of wasted medicines each year. Through an increased involvement in repeat prescribing, medicine monitoring and reviews, pharmacists can play a key role in improving the quality of the patient journey through the NHS in Scotland.\" The Royal College of Nursing James Kennedy, RCN Scottish board secretary warned that it was important that the plan's pledges and promises \"become reality,\" and that nurses were given a key role in implementing it. \"Nurses provide around 80% of direct patient care so it is vital that the voice of nurses is heard on these new boards. \"No one would contemplate running a school without listening to teachers How can we have a health service that puts the views of directors of finance above directors of nursing?\" He praised the plan's emphasis on family-friendly policies and said it would help with nurse retention, and even attract people back to nursing. Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) Rita Miller, COSLA's health spokesperson, was underwhelmed by the lack of emphasis on local government's role in partnership working with the NHS. \"We feel the references to local government are neither strong enough nor specific enough to make us feel that we are equal partners in what must clearly be a joint agenda. \"It is disappointing that, while there are significant proposals for councils - particularly developing them as public health organisations and the inclusion of a local government voice on the new NHS boards - we do not believe that the importance of local government has, as yet, been fully recognised.\" Action on Smoking and Health Maureen Moore, Chief Executive of ASH Scotland, welcomed the plan's commitment to consult on offering nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) via GP prescription as \"a great step forward\". She said: \"Making NRT freely available on prescription is a positive and cost-effective public health measure. Tobacco use kills one in five Scots every year yet, historically, little has been done to help the majority of smokers who wish to quit. \"Many smokers have been deterred from using NRT because of the high cost ,so this is a great step forward. NRT is a safe and effective way of helping smokers to quit and overcome their addiction to nicotine.\" BMA Scotland The BMA warned that the \"aspirational\" spirit of the proposals needed to be met with \"concerted effort\" from all professions to implement the plan. Dr John Garner, chairman of the Scottish Council of the BMA, said:\"The health plan delivers a clear set of goals for improving healthcare in Scotland and sets out detailed aspirations that are shared by all. The task ahead is to turn the plan's rhetoric into reality and develop practical improvements in patient care.\"",

And earlier this year, she directed her first feature, April Captains, Portugal's most expensive film ever, which chronicles the defining moment in recent Portuguese history: the April Revolution of 1974. </p> <p>De Medeiros's crime, for certain Portuguese critics, is to have treated seismic political events in a light-hearted and even flippant way. The actress-director is dismissive of such accusations. She argues that the revolution was every bit as chaotic as she portrays it: the mutineering soldiers really didn't know whether to stop their tanks at the traffic lights; they really did manage to lock themselves out of the car that had all the weapons in it; and, en route to topple dictator Marcello Caetano, they really were harassed by gays. </p> <p>All this, de Medeiros insists, is a matter of historical record. It was written about by the army leaders behind the coup. She interviewed them and they confirmed the old stories. \"I would be untrue to this revolution if I didn't show the funny aspect of it,\" de Medeiros says. </p> <p>April Captains thus features surreal scenes of tanks trundling down busy Lisbon roads, a painfully comic episode in which hapless soldiers take over a radio station (\"It's a coup d'etat - can we come in?\"), shots of couples sneaking off to make love in the tanks, and a sequence in which the two sides (the fascists and the mutineers) try to work out how to bargain with one another. (\"Who's in charge?\" an old officer asks. \"We all are,\" the revolutionaries answer.) At times, it's as if we're watching a Carry On version of a Costa-Gavras or Pontecorvo film. </p> <p>The coup was indeed a revolution with a difference. Sparked off by the broadcasting of an outlawed song, Grandola, on the radio, it was lead by young army officers, most of them barely into their 30s. They managed the unlikely feat of toppling a dictatorship that had ruled Portugal for 48 years, without killing a single person. (The only casualties were three men shot by the detested Pide secret police.) </p> <p>Once the revolution was over, the \"captains\" faded back into obscurity. Some became entangled with the new political parties that sprang up, but most, de Medeiros insists, were \"incorruptible\". They stayed in the army, where they conspicuously failed to have spectacular careers. </p> <p>Today the Portuguese don't like to talk about their revolution. \"I think we can be proud about it,\" de Medeiros says. \"It was an act full of respect and generosity for the people. The soldiers didn't shoot. But, for some reason, it's a kind of taboo. I think it's an oedipal complex. The civilian class was put in charge by these guys [in the army] and they prefer to forget who gave them that power.\" </p> <p>De Medeiros was nine when the revolution happened, living in exile with her parents in Austria. Her mother was a political journalist, her father a composer. \"I had very young parents. I saw them so happy - literally jumping around the living room. I understood something really important had happened.\" The family moved back to Portugal immediately. They no longer had a home and so took up residence in a Lisbon hotel along with hundreds of other returning exiles: \"I remember that in the bar of that hotel the constitution was being written.\" </p> <p>The immediate aftermath of the revolution was exhilarating. Citizens stuffed the barrels of the soldiers' weapons with flowers. Everybody began to discuss politics. \"People of my generation in Portugal fell into the magic potion of political ideas,\" de Medeiros recalls. \"What was very funny about this revolution was that it did not bring wealth to the Portuguese. But it brought language, ideas. You'd go to the fish market and all the women who were selling fish would call each other fascist, communist. It looked like a political meeting and it was just people talking. I remember my parents quarrelling. They would talk as if they were against each other's ideas about Trotsky, but it was just a couple arguing.\" </p> <p>Inevitably, the excitement died down and the Portuguese forgot that there had ever been a revolution. De Medeiros was one of the few to remember. She was 14 when she was first introduced to Salgueiro Maia, the young captain who had forced Caetano (Antonio de Oliveira Salazar's replacement) to resign. \"Then, when I was 21, I decided there was a movie to be made. I went to see him at the barracks. He was a very shy man. I was very shy, too. It was funny meeting him there. At that time, there were no girls allowed in the barracks. He was so generous. He immediately gave me all the information that he had, including papers that had not been published.\" </p> <p>Maia, who died of cancer in 1992, supported the project, but was not the type to seek the limelight.\"I am certain of at least one thing: no one can do everything. I recognise my incompetence in politics,\" he commented when politicians tried to talk him into joining the government. He probably would not have enjoyed seeing himself played on screen by Italian heart-throb Steffano Accorsi. </p> <p>Ironically, the Portuguese army had no objections to the film, but the intelligentsia did. April Captains has provoked fierce arguments in the Portuguese press. De Medeiros blames it on old-fashioned chauvinism. \"The left-wing thinkers and intellectuals have been more misogynist with me than the army,\" she says, complaining about their \"paternalistic, condescending\" attitude toward her. \"They can't accept that a young woman is able to think and they underestimate the intellectual work and study I might have done. They ask who is the man behind me.\" </p> <p>Even without the support of the intellectuals, the film, which took 13 years to make, has been a huge hit in Portugal. Ninety-two-year- old Portuguese auteur Manoel de Oliveira, who has worked with de Medeiros in the past, gave it his seal of approval, as did many of the country's leading politicians. De Medeiros talks about screenings at which audiences stood up and joined in the revolutionary songs. Through out the 1990s, financiers and actors passed in and out of the frame. Javier Bardem, Spain's biggest star, was briefly attached to the project. At one stage, de Medeiros even tried (unsuccessfully) to co-opt British playwright Edward Bond into helping her write the screenplay. The film ended up being financed by a hodge-podge of European backers. Needless to say, no British distributor has shown much interest in acquiring it for the UK. </p> <p>De Medeiros is now back in France, concentrating on her acting in various new European films. (Like Ana\u00efs Nin, she suggests, she's a foreigner everywhere, with a bit of an accent in every language.) Yes, she gets criticised for not staying put in her homeland. \"But I like to dream about Portugal and it's less easy when you are there.\" </p> <p>She hopes, at least, that April Captains will have reminded the Portuguese that their freedom can't be taken for granted. \"You have to cultivate it, and sometimes you don't realise you have lost it already. That was the message that the captains gave me. It's always easier to obey than to disobey - but we must keep in the corner of our mind a little voice saying we may have to disobey now_\"</p>",

The initiatives are expected to include: \u0095 Retaining local health councils as the local health services watchdog - the equivalent body in England and Wales, community health councils, were abolished in the English NHS plan. \u0095 Cutting waiting times for heart treatment - one of Scotland's biggest public health problems - so that patients wait no longer than 12 weeks for tests or 24 weeks for surgery by 2002. \u0095 Abolishing trusts and health boards, and creating in their place a single area body, called, for example, NHS Glasgow. \u0095 The introduction of voluntary smart cards for patients containing details of their medical records. The plan is the most important policy announcement to come out of the Scottish Executive this year, and is being seen as the first big test for new first minister Henry McLeish. It comes nearly five months after the publication of the NHS plan for England and Wales.",

There was \"remarkable consensus about the important issues before us\", he said.</p> <p>\"Our nation must rise above a house divided,\" Mr Bush said. But with Republicans now in control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives for the first time since the 1950s, Mr Bush also sketched out the domestic agenda which he now intends to pursue in the hardhat political atmosphere of Washington.</p> <p>\"These priorities are not merely Republican concerns or Democratic concerns, these are American responsibilities,\" Mr Bush said. \"I will give it my all,\" he promised.</p> <p>In his own no less minutely scrutinised televised concession speech last night, Mr Gore - standing with his wife, Tipper, four children and running mate, Joe Lieberman - finally said the words that Republicans had ached to hear for so long: \"I offer my concession.\"</p> <p>Mr Gore telephoned Mr Bush in Austin ahead of his speech - just as he had on November 8. \"Just moments ago I spoke with George W Bush and congratulated him on becoming the 43rd president of the United States. And I promised him I would not call him back this time,\" he joked.</p> <p>Mr Gore struck an unambiguously patriotic and conciliatory tone, touched with moments of self-deprecating humour, in a seven-minute address from his White House office in which he called on Americans to \"unite behind our next president\".</p> <p>In what must have been a searingly disappointing moment for a man who has yearned for the presidency for much of his adult life, Mr Gore said that \"partisan feeling must yield to patriotism\" and that America must \"heal the wounds\".</p> <p>Mr Gore said he strongly disagreed with the supreme court's decision to throw out his challenge to the election in Florida but said he would accept it. \"I accept the finality of this outcome,\" he said.</p> <p>In his often graceful and dignified concession, Mr Gore said he did not know what the future held for him. \"I don't know the answer to that one yet. I know I'll spend some time in Tennessee and mend some fences, literally and figuratively,\" he said.</p> <p>But as he left his office, supporters chanted \"Gore for 2004\".</p> <p>Mr Bush, 54, was due to name the first official members of his new Republican administration today but there was little mood of celebration in the almost deserted streets of Austin, Texas.</p> <p>The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said before Bush had voiced his own thoughts: \"I am absolutely confident that George W Bush will reach out and bring this country together. He needs to reassure the American people.\"</p> <p>The supreme court in effect handed the election to Mr Bush when its conservative majority, headed by the chief justice, William Rehnquist, voted by five votes to four to overturn the verdict of the Florida supreme court. They ordered an end to further counting of the disputed ballots in the state whose 25 electoral college votes will now go to Mr Bush.</p> <p>The ruling prompted a fierce new debate and there were accusations that the highest court in the land had acted in a partisan way. Mr Rehnquist and fellow judge Clarence Thomas took the unusual step of denying any political motives behind the court's judgment.</p> <p>One of the dissenting judges, John Paul Stevens, suggested that the real winner of the 2000 election might never be known, adding: \"The identity of the loser is perfectly clear - it is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush can now look forward to a 271 to 267 electoral college victory over Mr Gore on December 18. He will be sworn in as the 43rd president of the US next month.</p> <p>Mr Gore won the national popular vote by 50.2m to 49.8m. That makes Mr Bush the first US president since 1888 to fail to win a popular majority.</p> <p>Mr Bush is today expected to complete plans to travel with his wife Laura to Washington, perhaps as early as tomorrow.</p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7cad5\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,411232,00.html\">Full text: Bush victory speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,411233,00.html\">Full text: Gore concession speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,411170,00.html\">Jonathan Freedland: Can a system which allows the winner to lose go unreformed?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,411227,00.html\">Gore concedes after fight of his life</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,411178,00.html\">Gore's thoughts turn to the campaign of 2004</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,411169,00.html\">Seven key players in incoming cabinet</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,408820,00.html\"> Bush in quotes</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,408777,00.html\">Bush's transitional cabinet</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,410029,00.html\">George W Bush: key policies</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,398516,00.html\">Election glossary</a></p> <p><b>Interactive quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/quiz/questions/0,5961,387782,00.html\">Do you know your Bushisms?</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,409877,00.html\">After the vote, before the concession</a></p> <p><b>Interactive: results</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/flash/0,5543,394350,00.html\">Results declared, state by state</a></p> <p><b>Audio report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/1213kettle.ra\">Martin Kettle in Washington DC (3mins 40)</a></p> <p><b>Official Bush links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.georgewbush.com/\" target=\"_new\">George W Bush: official site</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bush2000.com/issues/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Bush's policies</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bushcheneytransition.com/\">Bush/Cheney: official transition site</a></p> <p><b>Unofficial Bush links</b><br><a href=\"http://politics.slate.msn.com/Features/bushisms/bushisms.asp\" target=\"_new\">Bushisms</a><br><a href=\"http://www.georgewbushspeaks.com/\" target=\"_new\">George W Bush speaks</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bushfiles.com/\" target=\"_new\">The Bush files</a><br><a href=\"http://www.sonofbush.com/\" target=\"_new\">Son of Bush</a><br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3750/bush.htm\" target=\"_new\">Bush watch</a></p> <p><b>Key rulings</b><br><a href=\"http://www.supremecourtus.gov/florida.html\" target=\"_new\">US supreme court rulings</a><br><a href=\"http://www.flcourts.org/pubinfo/election/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Florida supreme court rulings</a></p>",

He spoke less than an hour after his Democratic opponent, Al Gore, had finally conceded defeat following 36 days of election disputes that have left the US political system bruised and bleeding. \"I was not elected to serve one party but to serve one nation,\" Mr Bush said in his speech from the Texas House of Representatives in Austin. \"The president of the United States is the president of every single American, of every race and every background.\" Calling bipartisan cooperation \"the challenge of our moment\", Mr Bush said he hoped that \"the long wait of the last five weeks will heighten a desire to move beyond the bitterness and partisanship of the recent past\". There was \"remarkable consensus about the important issues before us\", he said. \"Our nation must rise above a house divided,\" Mr Bush said. But with Republicans now in control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives for the first time since the 1950s, Mr Bush also sketched out the domestic agenda which he now intends to pursue in the hardhat political atmosphere of Washington. \"These priorities are not merely Republican concerns or Democratic concerns, these are American responsibilities,\" Mr Bush said. \"I will give it my all,\" he promised. In his own no less minutely scrutinised televised concession speech last night, Mr Gore - standing with his wife, Tipper, four children and running mate, Joe Lieberman - finally said the words that Republicans had ached to hear for so long: \"I offer my concession.\" Mr Gore telephoned Mr Bush in Austin ahead of his speech - just as he had on November 8. \"Just moments ago I spoke with George W Bush and congratulated him on becoming the 43rd president of the United States. And I promised him I would not call him back this time,\" he joked. Mr Gore struck an unambiguously patriotic and conciliatory tone, touched with moments of self-deprecating humour, in a seven-minute address from his White House office in which he called on Americans to \"unite behind our next president\". In what must have been a searingly disappointing moment for a man who has yearned for the presidency for much of his adult life, Mr Gore said that \"partisan feeling must yield to patriotism\" and that America must \"heal the wounds\". Mr Gore said he strongly disagreed with the supreme court's decision to throw out his challenge to the election in Florida but said he would accept it. \"I accept the finality of this outcome,\" he said. In his often graceful and dignified concession, Mr Gore said he did not know what the future held for him. \"I don't know the answer to that one yet. I know I'll spend some time in Tennessee and mend some fences, literally and figuratively,\" he said. But as he left his office, supporters chanted \"Gore for 2004\". Mr Bush, 54, was due to name the first official members of his new Republican administration today but there was little mood of celebration in the almost deserted streets of Austin, Texas. The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said before Bush had voiced his own thoughts: \"I am absolutely confident that George W Bush will reach out and bring this country together. He needs to reassure the American people.\" The supreme court in effect handed the election to Mr Bush when its conservative majority, headed by the chief justice, William Rehnquist, voted by five votes to four to overturn the verdict of the Florida supreme court. They ordered an end to further counting of the disputed ballots in the state whose 25 electoral college votes will now go to Mr Bush. The ruling prompted a fierce new debate and there were accusations that the highest court in the land had acted in a partisan way. Mr Rehnquist and fellow judge Clarence Thomas took the unusual step of denying any political motives behind the court's judgment. One of the dissenting judges, John Paul Stevens, suggested that the real winner of the 2000 election might never be known, adding: \"The identity of the loser is perfectly clear - it is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.\" Mr Bush can now look forward to a 271 to 267 electoral college victory over Mr Gore on December 18. He will be sworn in as the 43rd president of the US next month. Mr Gore won the national popular vote by 50.2m to 49.8m. That makes Mr Bush the first US president since 1888 to fail to win a popular majority. Mr Bush is today expected to complete plans to travel with his wife Laura to Washington, perhaps as early as tomorrow. Talk about it What do you think?

      "body": "<p>The future of the supreme court, highest judicial body in the US, was thrown into the spotlight yesterday after it issued an early-morning majority ruling that caused uproar among Democrats and prompted the condemnation of some of its own judges.</p> <p>Judge John Stevens, the main dissenter on the nine-member panel, issued a swingeing indictment of the ruling, by 5-4, that Florida had run out of time to stage proper recounts of disputed ballots from the November 7 vote. He warned that the decision had wounded the backbone of the rule of law - confidence in judges - by questioning the impartiality of Florida courts.</p> <p>\"Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law,\" he said.</p> <p>The Democrat Jesse Jackson said he disagreed with the outcome \"with every bone in my body and every ounce of moral strength in my soul\". He accused the US supreme court of acting as a \"willing tool of the Bush campaign\" and of orchestrating a \"velvet legal coup\".</p> <p>The historic verdict was handed to the waiting world early on Wednesday morning. Earlier, members of the court were spotted leaving their Capitol Hill offices looking tired and drawn. They had been called upon to resolve the nation's argument and they seemed to buckle under the weight of that responsibility.</p> <p>More than 60 pages of opinion and rulings made up its judgment in the case of Bush v Gore. Some of the dissenting judgments were eloquent and pointed. But it was the 13 pages of the unsigned majority verdict that will be remembered by Mr Bush and his supporters with undying gratitude for finally paving the Republican's way to the White House.</p> <p>\"None are more conscious of the vital limits on judicial authority than are the members of this court,\" the majority wrote in a dramatic conclusion which was condemned by Gore supporters as a historic piece of judicial hypocrisy.</p> <p>\"When contending parties invoke the process of the courts, however, it becomes our unsought responsibility to resolve the federal and constitutional issues the judicial sys tem has been forced to confront. The judgment of the supreme court of Florida is reversed.\"</p> <p>Only 10 days ago, in its earlier ruling on Bush v Palm Beach county, the nine member court had made more than a show of reluctance to become involved in what has traditionally been an area of state law.</p> <p>\"As a general rule, this court defers to a state court's interpretation of a state statute,\" it concluded, sending Mr Bush's complaint against the Florida supreme court back to Tallahassee.</p> <p>That earlier cautious judgment was consistent with the doctrine of \"judicial restraint\" which has generally characterised the work of the US supreme court under the conservative chief justice, William Rehnquist.</p> <p>But last Saturday, when it intervened to stop the latest recount ordered by the Florida court, the Rehnquist court began to signal a change of approach.</p> <p>Tuesday night's ruling in Bush v Gore carried the abrupt change of course further. Basing itself firmly on the constitutional principle of equal protection under the law, the majority crossed the federalist frontier with scarcely a backward glance, wading deep into Florida law to unpick and rewrite the state's election rules in an exceptionally detailed way with wide implications for the conduct of all future elections.</p> <p>It is not just the right to vote that must be equally protected, the majority ruled, but the manner in which the right is exercised.</p> <p>That means that any recounts which examine the voter's intent where that is not immediately clear need to be subject to \"specific rules designed to ensure uniform treatment\", the court ruled.</p> <p>The real sting of the judgment came in the tail. Having established that there was a constitutional problem of unequal protection, the five conservatives on the court then decided that there was no way of remedying it.</p> <p>\"It is obvious that the recount cannot be conducted in compliance with the requirements of equal protection and due process without substantial additional work,\" the majority concluded. Federal law was designed to meet a December 12 deadline for selecting members of the electoral college. \"That date is upon us,\" the judges observed as they issued their ruling at 10pm on that very date.</p> <p>At the heart of critics' arguments last night was one central point: that the supreme court had said the Florida election was full of unfairness, and yet they had then decreed that that unfairness must not be remedied.</p> <p>That decision in effect gave the presidency to Mr Bush, the candidate for whom all of the five justices in the majority are likely to have voted, if indeed they voted at all.</p> <p><b>Rival factions on the bench</b></p> <p><b>Opinion of the supreme court (majority ruling):</b></p> <p>It is obvious that the recount cannot be conducted in compliance with the requirements of equal protection and due process without substantial additional work. It would require not only the adoption of adequate state-wide standards for determining what is a legal vote... but also orderly judicial review of any disputed matters that might arise.</p> <p>The supreme court of Florida has said that the legislature intended the state's electors to \"participate fully in the federal electoral process\", as provided in 3 USC Sec 5. That statute, in turn, requires that any controversy or contest that is designed to lead to a conclusive selection of electors be completed by December 12. That date is upon us. Because it is evident that any recount seeking to meet the December 12 date will be unconstitutional for the reasons we have discussed, we reverse the judgment of the supreme court of Florida ordering a recount to proceed.</p> <p><b> Justice John Paul Stevens's dissent, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer:</b></p> <p>What must underlie petitioners' entire federal assault on the Florida election procedures is an unstated lack of confidence in the impartiality and capacity of the state judges who would make the critical decisions if the vote count were to proceed. Otherwise, their position is wholly without merit. The endorsement of that position by the majority of this court can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the land. It is confidence in the men and women who administer the judicial system that is the true backbone of the rule of law.

      "bodyText": "The future of the supreme court, highest judicial body in the US, was thrown into the spotlight yesterday after it issued an early-morning majority ruling that caused uproar among Democrats and prompted the condemnation of some of its own judges. Judge John Stevens, the main dissenter on the nine-member panel, issued a swingeing indictment of the ruling, by 5-4, that Florida had run out of time to stage proper recounts of disputed ballots from the November 7 vote. He warned that the decision had wounded the backbone of the rule of law - confidence in judges - by questioning the impartiality of Florida courts. \"Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law,\" he said. The Democrat Jesse Jackson said he disagreed with the outcome \"with every bone in my body and every ounce of moral strength in my soul\". He accused the US supreme court of acting as a \"willing tool of the Bush campaign\" and of orchestrating a \"velvet legal coup\". The historic verdict was handed to the waiting world early on Wednesday morning. Earlier, members of the court were spotted leaving their Capitol Hill offices looking tired and drawn. They had been called upon to resolve the nation's argument and they seemed to buckle under the weight of that responsibility. More than 60 pages of opinion and rulings made up its judgment in the case of Bush v Gore. Some of the dissenting judgments were eloquent and pointed. But it was the 13 pages of the unsigned majority verdict that will be remembered by Mr Bush and his supporters with undying gratitude for finally paving the Republican's way to the White House. \"None are more conscious of the vital limits on judicial authority than are the members of this court,\" the majority wrote in a dramatic conclusion which was condemned by Gore supporters as a historic piece of judicial hypocrisy. \"When contending parties invoke the process of the courts, however, it becomes our unsought responsibility to resolve the federal and constitutional issues the judicial sys tem has been forced to confront. The judgment of the supreme court of Florida is reversed.\" Only 10 days ago, in its earlier ruling on Bush v Palm Beach county, the nine member court had made more than a show of reluctance to become involved in what has traditionally been an area of state law. \"As a general rule, this court defers to a state court's interpretation of a state statute,\" it concluded, sending Mr Bush's complaint against the Florida supreme court back to Tallahassee. That earlier cautious judgment was consistent with the doctrine of \"judicial restraint\" which has generally characterised the work of the US supreme court under the conservative chief justice, William Rehnquist. But last Saturday, when it intervened to stop the latest recount ordered by the Florida court, the Rehnquist court began to signal a change of approach. Tuesday night's ruling in Bush v Gore carried the abrupt change of course further. Basing itself firmly on the constitutional principle of equal protection under the law, the majority crossed the federalist frontier with scarcely a backward glance, wading deep into Florida law to unpick and rewrite the state's election rules in an exceptionally detailed way with wide implications for the conduct of all future elections. It is not just the right to vote that must be equally protected, the majority ruled, but the manner in which the right is exercised. That means that any recounts which examine the voter's intent where that is not immediately clear need to be subject to \"specific rules designed to ensure uniform treatment\", the court ruled. The real sting of the judgment came in the tail. Having established that there was a constitutional problem of unequal protection, the five conservatives on the court then decided that there was no way of remedying it. \"It is obvious that the recount cannot be conducted in compliance with the requirements of equal protection and due process without substantial additional work,\" the majority concluded. Federal law was designed to meet a December 12 deadline for selecting members of the electoral college. \"That date is upon us,\" the judges observed as they issued their ruling at 10pm on that very date. At the heart of critics' arguments last night was one central point: that the supreme court had said the Florida election was full of unfairness, and yet they had then decreed that that unfairness must not be remedied. That decision in effect gave the presidency to Mr Bush, the candidate for whom all of the five justices in the majority are likely to have voted, if indeed they voted at all. Rival factions on the bench Opinion of the supreme court (majority ruling): It is obvious that the recount cannot be conducted in compliance with the requirements of equal protection and due process without substantial additional work. It would require not only the adoption of adequate state-wide standards for determining what is a legal vote... but also orderly judicial review of any disputed matters that might arise. The supreme court of Florida has said that the legislature intended the state's electors to \"participate fully in the federal electoral process\", as provided in 3 USC Sec 5. That statute, in turn, requires that any controversy or contest that is designed to lead to a conclusive selection of electors be completed by December 12. That date is upon us. Because it is evident that any recount seeking to meet the December 12 date will be unconstitutional for the reasons we have discussed, we reverse the judgment of the supreme court of Florida ordering a recount to proceed. Justice John Paul Stevens's dissent, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer: What must underlie petitioners' entire federal assault on the Florida election procedures is an unstated lack of confidence in the impartiality and capacity of the state judges who would make the critical decisions if the vote count were to proceed. Otherwise, their position is wholly without merit. The endorsement of that position by the majority of this court can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the land. It is confidence in the men and women who administer the judicial system that is the true backbone of the rule of law. Time will one day heal the wound to that confidence that will be inflicted by today's decision. One thing, however, is certain. Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.

      "bodyText": "Athlete Diane Modahl today lost her high court damages action over a ban imposed in the wake of drug-taking allegations. Mrs Modahl, 34, had alleged bias on the part of a disciplinary committee which imposed the four-year ban in December 1994 - six months after urine tests in Lisbon allegedly showed a high level of testosterone. An independent appeal panel lifted the ban in July 1995 after doubts were cast on the accuracy of the tests. She was claiming \u00a3480,000 spent on legal and medical advice, plus a similar figure in punitive damages over the way the case was handled by the British Athletic Federation, now in administration and superseded by UK Athletics. Her solicitor-advocate, Anthony Julius, had told the court that the case was about injustice and the loss of livelihood. \"She makes a legal case which is also a moral case. It's a case about bias and it's therefore a case about the proper administration of justice,\" he told Mr Justice Douglas Brown. The BAF argued that the doping charge was fairly dealt with and that there was \"no substance\" to the allegation of actual or apparent bias. Dismissing her case, the judge said that his conclusion was that Mrs Modahl had a \"fair deal\". He said: \"The constitution of the disciplinary committee was carefully and fairly chosen to give a balance of skills and representation and provide Mrs Modahl trial by at least some of her peers.\" The evidence, apart from the \"unsuccessful attempts to tarnish\" the committee chairman, Dr Martyn Lucking, and another committee member, Al Guy, was unchallenged, the judge said. He added that he was compelled to the view that the committee had \"carried out its function conscientiously and fairly\". The hearing process provided for an appeal as of right and by way of re-hearing conducted by a QC and two other members and \"no sensible criticism\" could be made of their adjudication or the decision. He emphasised that the issue of Mrs Modahl's guilt or innocence was not in question. The judge said that Mrs Modahl's action must fail although her innocence \"was established with clarity and forever\" by the decision of the independent appeal panel, which had also concluded that the disciplinary committee reached a reasonable decision on the evidence before it. The judge also said that the claim could not succeed because crucially there was no contract between the BAF and Mrs Modahl, of Sale, Greater Manchester. The judge dismissed the allegation that Dr Lucking was guilty of apparent bias in that the test procedure was based on suspicion of all athletes. He also said that Mr Guy was \"a truly impressive witness, obviously imbued with a sense of fairness\". A suggestion that he was in any way biased failed completely.

Jon Rouse, 32, winner of the MBA finance award from Nottingham's business school, has asked for the \u00a350 prize to be donated to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. \"Accepting money legitimises an organisation that trades in a product that kills people,\" he said. The business school set off the controversy by taking BAT's money to open an international centre for corporate social responsibility. \u0095 Europe's powerful tobacco lobby suffered a big setback yesterday after Euro MPs backed tough new rules forcing manufacturers to put shocking images of cancerous lungs and rotting teeth on cigarette packets. In a vote in Strasbourg, the parliament approved legislation obliging the industry, by 2003, to cover 30% of the front of every packet sold in the EU with a health warning. At the moment, in the UK, 6% of a packet's surface is taken up with a warning. There was immediate retaliation from the tobacco lobby which claimed that several of the measures approved by the parliament risked thousands of jobs, many in the UK. British American Tobacco warned that the decision to ban European factories from making cigarettes with a tar content of more than 10mg per cigarette for domestic consumption and export could be particularly damaging to employment. A representative of BAT said: \"This will act as a de facto export ban threatening the loss of 1,800 jobs in BAT factories, mainly in the UK, and a further 6,000 jobs among suppliers. \"We are calling upon the Council of Europe ministers - and Alan Milburn, the secretary of state for health - to help eliminate the export clause before it is too late.\" The industry now has one last chance to try to derail the measures as the final text of the directive will be hammered out between EU health ministers and Euro MPs in the new year with the European commission acting as go-between.

      "bodyText": "The future of Melody Maker is in the balance after IPC chief executive Sly Bailey failed to rule out closure for the rock bible. Her remarks have fuelled speculation that the 73-year-old magazine could be closed as part of the forthcoming review of the IPC's music and sport titles under its new managing director, Mike Soutar. Asked whether the magazine, which has seen its circulation dwindle to 30,000, would be dropped or sold, Ms Bailey said: \"We are constantly reviewing our magazine portfolio. \"New Eden - a new-age gardening magazine which closed earlier this year - was a brave new launch which failed to live up to our expectations. I can't rule out any closures or new launches.\" The threat to Melody Maker comes just two weeks after Emap closed the Britpop magazine Select, claiming that the market no longer existed for a rock-oriented title. Melody Maker saw its circulation drop by 21% in the six months to May. This represents a huge fall from its 1970s heyday, when it used to sell around 250,000 copies. Melody Maker, once the stalwart of the rock 'n' roll press, has come under increasingly stiff competition from newer dance magazine launches and online music sites. Earlier this year, IPC moved its sports magazines out of the division, prompting speculation that the music and sport division was due for a rebranding. Mr Soutar and former Emap director Tim Brook are looking at a restructure. Ms Bailey said the company planned to pour \u00a315m into the company's new digital strategy, which could include moves into television production. MediaGuardian.co.uk reported a few months ago that IPC had had preliminary talks with MTV about joint TV deals. IPC announced a pre-tax profit of \u00a315.1m on sales of \u00a3387.9m. Ms Bailey said IPC's revenues had taken a knock from price-cutting to protect IPC's market-leading TV listings magazine, What's On TV? She said: \"In a year when there's been a major assault on the TV listings market, which is one of our core markets, I'm particularly pleased that we've managed to stave this off.\"",

      "bodyText": "Some 200,000 private tenants, many of them elderly, will have breathed a huge sigh of relief following a landmark ruling from the House of Lords that allows the government to cap the rents of private tenants. By making rents more affordable, particularly in high-cost areas such as London, ministers hope to keep most of those 200,000 in their homes and off the housing benefit books. The judgment affects the large lump of secure tenants who still enjoy rent protection because they took out their tenancies before the 1988 Housing Act came into force. Their rents are currently set by a local rents officer, who reviews charges every two years. But the new cap will mean the officers cannot increase rents by more than inflation plus 10% at the next review, and 5% thereafter. The policy was threatened in January, when the court of appeal said the government could not place the ceiling on rent rises. In a case brought by Manchester landlord Spath Homes, the appeal court judges said that housing minister Nick Raynsford had exceeded his powers by issuing the Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Act) 1999 order, which was designed to prevent over the top rent rises for secure tenants living in private accommodation. But last week's ruling confirms the validity of that order. Jackie Peacock of the Brent Private Tenants' Rights Group, who was in the vanguard of moves to reverse the appeal court judgment, was delighted by the Lords' ruling. \"This is wonderful, wonderful news and the best Christmas present tenants have ever had,\" she said. The ruling would remove a great source of uncertainty for many mainly elderly tenants who would otherwise have faced escalating rent rises and been pushed onto housing benefit if it had remained in place, she said. Tenants living in the capital, where Ms Peacock is based, have felt the brunt of the appeal court ruling because rent increases there are likely to be higher there than in other parts of the country. Her joy was mirrored by the gloom of Richard Lambert, spokesman for commercial landlords' body the British Property Federation (BPF), who had pressed for the order to be scrapped. \"This is hugely disappointing,\" he said. \"The finding that the procedure used by the government was lawful should not obscure the fact that the rent capping has been a political gesture from the start.

Also a crucial source of those IRA agents you said you'd be needing to implement new taxation policies.</p> <p><b> 5 Iraq </b><br><br> The fate of the Kurds is simply a tragic waste of human life, seeing as how they are perfectly well qualified to do all the menial jobs on oilfields supplying fuel to the US - and all in exchange for a few packets of aspirin. Also probably worth forging closer diplomatic relations, what with more and more American imports coming from overseas and everything.

Recently, however, has curiously metamorphosed into a hotbed of evil narcotic exporters whom all decent Americans must surely wish to see eradicated once and for all.</p> <p><b> 9 Russia </b><br><br> A confusing one these days. Recent reports suggest that the Russian government is seething with corruption, its labyrinthian offices and corridors staffed by indolent good-for-nothings with a history of heavy drinking. As such, few points of similarity with a Bush administration, and probably therefore not a priority.</p> <p><b> 10 Canada </b><br><br> A winter-sports town that is popular with vacationing Americans. Sizeable minority of population speak in unidentified foreign language. Cf: Greece.</p> <p><b> 11 Cuba </b><br><br> Vast, evil empire funded by cigar exports. This sinister nation exerts a massive and dangerous influence on global security which must be held in check at all costs. The rest of the world is in full agreement with the Bush administration that Fidel Castro represents a significant threat to world security, as opposed, say, to being a laughable speechifying bore with comical facial hair whose biggest achievement to date is failing to have suppressed the Buena Vista Social Club.</p> <p><b> 12 Mexico</b> <br><br>Population that is roughly evenly divided into a) an excellent source of cheap labour for major US corporations and b) hordes of reprehensible wetbacks.</p> <p><b> 13 Alaska </b><br><br> America's last true wilderness, a haven for wolves, reindeer and caribou. Which is kind of stupid when you think about it, given the untapped oil reserves that lie underneath all that snow. With just a little bit of mining, why, you could easily turn this into a landscape which is just as visually stunning as, oooh, central Texas.</p> <p><b> 14 Greece </b><br><br> Reportedly the home to a large population of Grecians. Evidently this is not worth taking seriously, since any mention of said Grecians in interviews seems to provoke uncontrollable laughter on the part of listeners.</p> <p><b> 15 Rogue States, Madmen, Terrorists And Stuff </b><br><br> Initial CIA briefings indicate significant security risks. We don't know where they are, but they're there, and we don't know who \"they\" are, but there is a they, and the they that there is are there. Wherever that is.

Also a crucial source of those IRA agents you said you'd be needing to implement new taxation policies. 5 Iraq The fate of the Kurds is simply a tragic waste of human life, seeing as how they are perfectly well qualified to do all the menial jobs on oilfields supplying fuel to the US - and all in exchange for a few packets of aspirin. Also probably worth forging closer diplomatic relations, what with more and more American imports coming from overseas and everything. (Support of leader could also provide a useful Middle Eastern bridgehead for combating all the madmen and terrorists of this world, eg Saddam Hussein.) 6 Slovakia See Slovenia. 7 Slovenia See Slovakia. (Although, on second thoughts, probably best not to bother.) 8 Colombia Formerly an extremely convenient source of cocaine for young and irresponsible scions of wealthy American dynasties. Recently, however, has curiously metamorphosed into a hotbed of evil narcotic exporters whom all decent Americans must surely wish to see eradicated once and for all. 9 Russia A confusing one these days. Recent reports suggest that the Russian government is seething with corruption, its labyrinthian offices and corridors staffed by indolent good-for-nothings with a history of heavy drinking. As such, few points of similarity with a Bush administration, and probably therefore not a priority. 10 Canada A winter-sports town that is popular with vacationing Americans. Sizeable minority of population speak in unidentified foreign language. Cf: Greece. 11 Cuba Vast, evil empire funded by cigar exports. This sinister nation exerts a massive and dangerous influence on global security which must be held in check at all costs. The rest of the world is in full agreement with the Bush administration that Fidel Castro represents a significant threat to world security, as opposed, say, to being a laughable speechifying bore with comical facial hair whose biggest achievement to date is failing to have suppressed the Buena Vista Social Club. 12 Mexico Population that is roughly evenly divided into a) an excellent source of cheap labour for major US corporations and b) hordes of reprehensible wetbacks. 13 Alaska America's last true wilderness, a haven for wolves, reindeer and caribou. Which is kind of stupid when you think about it, given the untapped oil reserves that lie underneath all that snow. With just a little bit of mining, why, you could easily turn this into a landscape which is just as visually stunning as, oooh, central Texas. 14 Greece Reportedly the home to a large population of Grecians. Evidently this is not worth taking seriously, since any mention of said Grecians in interviews seems to provoke uncontrollable laughter on the part of listeners. 15 Rogue States, Madmen, Terrorists And Stuff Initial CIA briefings indicate significant security risks. We don't know where they are, but they're there, and we don't know who \"they\" are, but there is a they, and the they that there is are there. Wherever that is. (See also: Middle East and Pakistan's leader, General \"General\".) 16 Florida Unpredictable independent republic bordering Alabama. Ruling junta is thought to be sympathetic to a Bush White House, but has yet to embrace American principles of democracy and fair elections, and is highly vulnerable to coups d'\u00e9tat.

A survey for the Royal College of Nursing shows that to meet the target, the NHS will need to recruit 110,000 nurses to replace the 90,000 expected to leave in the next three years.

Just moments ago, I spoke with George W Bush and congratulated him on becoming the 43rd president of the United States, and I promised him that I wouldn't call him back this time.</p> <p>I offered to meet with him as soon as possible so that we can start to heal the divisions of the campaign and the contest through which we just passed.</p> <p>Almost a century and a half ago, senator Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, \"Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I'm with you, Mr president, and God bless you.\"</p> <p>Well, in that same spirit, I say to president-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancour must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country.</p> <p>Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road.

Yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honoured institutions of our democracy.</p> <p>Over the library of one of our great law schools is inscribed the motto, \"Not under man but under God and law\".</p> <p>That's the ruling principle of American freedom, the source of our democratic liberties. I've tried to make it my guide throughout this contest as it has guided America's deliberations of all the complex issues of the past five weeks.</p> <p>Now the US supreme court has spoken. Let there be no doubt, while I strongly disagree with the court's decision, I accept it.</p> <p>I accept the finality of this outcome which will be ratified next Monday in the electoral college. And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.</p> <p>I also accept my responsibility, which I will discharge unconditionally, to honour the new president-elect and do everything possible to help him bring Americans together in fulfilment of the great vision that our Declaration of Independence defines and that our constitution affirms and defends.</p> <p>Let me say how grateful I am to all those who supported me and supported the cause for which we have fought. Tipper and I feel a deep gratitude to Joe and Hadassah Lieberman who brought passion and high purpose to our partnership and opened new doors, not just for our campaign but for our country.</p> <p>This has been an extraordinary election. But in one of God's unforeseen paths, this belatedly broken impasse can point us all to a new common ground, for its very closeness can serve to remind us that we are one people with a shared history and a shared destiny.</p> <p>Indeed, that history gives us many examples of contests as hotly debated, as fiercely fought, with their own challenges to the popular will.</p> <p>Other disputes have dragged on for weeks before reaching resolution. And each time, both the victor and the vanquished have accepted the result peacefully and in the spirit of reconciliation. So let it be with us.</p> <p>I know that many of my supporters are disappointed. I am too. But our disappointment must be overcome by our love of country.</p> <p>And I say to our fellow members of the world community, let no one see this contest as a sign of American weakness. The strength of American democracy is shown most clearly through the difficulties it can overcome.</p> <p>Some have expressed concern that the unusual nature of this election might hamper the next president in the conduct of his office. I do not believe it need be so.</p> <p>President-elect Bush inherits a nation whose citizens will be ready to assist him in the conduct of his large responsibilities.</p> <p>I personally will be at his disposal, and I call on all Americans - I particularly urge all who stood with us to unite behind our next president. This is America. Just as we fight hard when the stakes are high, we close ranks and come together when the contest is done.</p> <p>And while there will be time enough to debate our continuing differences, now is the time to recognise that that which unites us is greater than that which divides us.</p> <p>While we yet hold and do not yield our opposing beliefs, there is a higher duty than the one we owe to political party. This is America and we put country before party. We will stand together behind our new president.</p> <p>As for what I'll do next, I don't know the answer to that one yet. Like many of you, I'm looking forward to spending the holidays with family and old friends. I know I'll spend time in Tennessee and mend some fences, literally and figuratively.</p> <p>Some have asked whether I have any regrets and I do have one regret: that I didn't get the chance to stay and fight for the American people over the next four years, especially for those who need burdens lifted and barriers removed, especially for those who feel their voices have not been heard. I heard you and I will not forget.</p> <p>I've seen America in this campaign and I like what I see. It's worth fighting for and that's a fight I'll never stop.</p> <p>As for the battle that ends tonight, I do believe as my father once said, that no matter how hard the loss, defeat might serve as well as victory to shape the soul and let the glory out.</p> <p>So for me this campaign ends as it began: with the love of Tipper and our family; with faith in God and in the country I have been so proud to serve, from Vietnam to the vice presidency; and with gratitude to our truly tireless campaign staff and volunteers, including all those who worked so hard in Florida for the last 36 days.</p> <p>Now the political struggle is over and we turn again to the unending struggle for the common good of all Americans and for those multitudes around the world who look to us for leadership in the cause of freedom.</p> <p>In the words of our great hymn, \"America, America, let us crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea.\"</p> <p>And now, my friends, in a phrase I once addressed to others, it's time for me to go.

Haycraft sees herself as a backstop. \"Any emergency and I'll drop everything else and put them at the top of my list,\" she says. \"It's a flaming nuisance, but there it is. That's family.\" </p> <p>\"The idea that your children are off your hands at 18 is just nonsense,\" says one tired grandmother of four. \"The moment they've got children of their own you're on permanent standby. One day they're on the phone saying, 'Don't come round this afternoon, so-and-so is going to be there and you'll only say something embarrassing.' And then, the next day, it's, 'I'm working today and the au pair's sick. Can you possibly hold the fort? Oh, and ask dad if he can collect Sam from James Simmond's birthday party, and he's got to be there at five on the dot.' \" </p> <p>This grandmother says she is not surprised to learn that 46% of all childcare in this country is now done by grandparents. That works out at 13m hours of babysitting each year, estimates Age Concern. Paid at the national minimum wage, that would cost parents nearly \u00a350m a year. </p> <p>Of course, money is not what it is all about. Most grandparents love their grandchildren and take comfort in being needed, particularly today's grannies. Many are the feminists of the 60s and 70s, still carrying around a burden of guilt because they went out to work instead of staying at home with their children. Now these grown-up children only have to press a panic button and the grannies come running. </p> <p>A friend of mine, the director of a London public relations company, drops everything and drives down to Wiltshire to look after her granddaughter every time her daughter, an accountant, rings to say that her childminding arrangements have gone haywire. On one of these mercy dashes she had to cancel a client and lost the account. \"I just knew that I'd rather spend time with Jemima than keep that client,\" she said. She admitted later that another motive propelling her along the M3 was the thought of the Other Woman - the homely other granny - being summoned instead of her. </p> <p>The television presenter Joan Bakewell, now chair of the British Film Institute, says that although she and her film producer husband, Jack Emery, have busy careers, they always try to keep space in their diaries during school holidays and half-terms. </p> <p>\"It does mean forgoing some income,\" she admits, \"but I think family ties are far more important.\" </p> <p>Felicity Kendal, now shimmering seductively around the London stage in Fallen Angels, admits to dropping everything when her granddaughter comes round. She keeps open house for her children and the children and granddaughter of her sister, who died of cancer. They all have a key to her house. </p> <p>The columnist and agony aunt Katharine Whitehorn, a grandmother of two, does a regular childminding stint every Thursday to allow her daughter-in-law, a violinist, to train as a music therapist. </p> <p>\"I insisted she did it,\" says Whitehorn, \"and a regular time is easy to work around. The other day my son phoned and said could they leave Ruby, who is three, with us for the day. We had 11 people coming to lunch, so I said, 'No, certainly not.' \" </p> <p>It is nice to be wanted, not so good to be taken for granted. Why does it never occur to the young couples who go back to work when their children reach school age that all schools have half-terms and long holidays? Is it because their perception of a grandmother is still the stereotypical image of a lovable old dear nodding indulgently at a four-year-old having a temper tantrum. \"We'll bring Jonathan over to you nice and early so you can have him for the whole day.\" And they really, truly believe they are doing you a favour. </p> <p>Don't they realise how tiring children are when you're over 40? How cumbersome the collapsible pushchair that won't collapse, the complicated car seat that needs a Kwik-Fit mechanic to install it, the disposable nappies that come in different sizes, for God's sake? </p> <p>\"I had my grandchildren for the weekend recently, and was on my knees and dying for a whisky by their bedtime,\" says a 62-year-old grandmother. \"They love running up and down the stairs - and falling down them, too. They are your responsibility but somebody else's children, and you can't take your eyes off them for a minute.\" </p> <p>Tessa Blackstone summed up for the government in a recent Lords debate on grandparenting, but in Grandmothers of the Revolution, a fascinating miscellany of grandmotherly views edited by Geoff Dench, she recalls her own feelings of rueful inadequacy when she was left to babysit.

A small child chucking food around the table and shouting \"Go away! Shan't!

How about a nice banana?\" </p> <p>Of course, grandparents have always stepped in when a mother dies, or is physically or mentally incapable of looking after her children, but the increase in teenage pregnancy combined with the breakdown of families means that one in four families with children are now headed by a single parent. Add to that the fact that both parents go out to work in two-thirds of two-parent families with children, and you can see why grandparents are now so popular. </p> <p>For some it is a full-time job. The Children Act of 1989, which encouraged the courts to keep children in the family instead of putting them into care, up for adoption or with foster parents, \"so long as the grandparents or other relatives can do it\", has resulted in no empty nest for these second-time-around parents; no nest egg either. In these families, it's trainers for the teenagers instead of G&amp;Ts for Grandma and Grandpa.

      "body": "<p>Thank you very much. Good evening my fellow Americans, I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you tonight. Mr speaker, lieutenant governor, friends, distinguished guests.</p> <p>Our country has been through a long and trying period, with the outcome of the presidential election not finalised for longer than any of us could have ever imagined.</p> <p>Vice president Gore and I put our hearts and hopes into our campaigns; we both gave it our all. We shared similar emotions.</p> <p>I understand how difficult this moment must be for vice president Gore and his family. He has a distinguished record of service to our country as a congressman, a senator and as vice president.</p> <p>This evening I received a gracious call from the vice president. We agreed to meet early next week in Washington and we agreed to do our best to heal our country after this hard fought contest.</p> <p>Tonight, I want to thank all the volunteers and campaign workers who worked so hard on my behalf, I also salute the vice president and his supporters for waging a spirited campaign and I thank him for a call that I know was difficult to make.</p> <p>Laura and I wish the vice president and senator Lieberman and their families the very best. I have a lot to be thankful for tonight. I am thankful for America and thankful that we are able to resolve our electoral differences in a peaceful way.</p> <p>And I am thankful to the American people for the great privilege of being able to serve as your next president.</p> <p>I want to thank my wife and our daughters for their love. Laura's active involvement as first lady has made Texas a better place, and she will be a wonderful first lady for America.</p> <p>I am proud to have Dick Cheney by my side, and America will be proud to have him as our next vice president. Tonight, I chose to speak from the chamber of the Texas house of representatives because it has been a home to bipartisan co-operation.</p> <p>Here, in a place where Democrats have the majority, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to do what is right for the people we represent.</p> <p>We've had spirited disagreements, and in the end, we found constructive consensus. It is an experience I will always carry with me, an example I will always follow.</p> <p>I thank my friend, house speaker Pete Laney, a Democrat, who introduced me today. I want to thank the legislators of both political parties with whom I worked. Across the hall in our Texas capitol is the state senate, and I cannot help but think of our mutual friend, the former Democrat lieutenant governor Bob Bullock.</p> <p>His love for Texas and his ability to work in a bipartisan way continue to be a model for all of us. The spirit of co-operation I have seen in this hall is what is needed in Washington. It is the challenge of our moment.</p> <p>After a difficult election, we must put politics behind us and work together to make the promise of America available for every one of our citizens.</p> <p>I'm optimistic that we can change the tone in Washington DC. I believe things happen for a reason, and I hope the long wait of the last five weeks will heighten a desire to move beyond the bitterness and partisanship of the recent past.</p> <p>Our nation must rise above a house divided. Americans share hopes and goals and values far more important than any political disagreements. Republicans want the best for our nation. And so do Democrats. Our votes may differ, but not our hopes.</p> <p>I know America wants reconciliation and unity. I know Americans want progress. And we must seize this moment and deliver.</p> <p>Together, guided by a spirit of common sense, common courtesy and common goals, we can unite and inspire the American citizens.</p> <p>Together, we will work to make all our public schools excellent, teaching every student of every background and every accent, so that no child is left behind. Together, we will save social security and renew its promise of a secure retirement for generations to come.</p> <p>Together, we will strengthen Medicare and offer prescription drug coverage to all of our seniors. Together, we will give Americans the broad, fair and fiscally responsible tax relief they deserve.</p> <p>Together, we'll have a bipartisan foreign policy true to our values and true to our friends. And we will have a military equal to every challenge, and superior to every adversary.</p> <p>Together, we will address some of society's deepest problems one person at a time, by encouraging and empowering the good hearts and good works of the American people.</p> <p>This is the essence of compassionate conservatism, and it will be a foundation of my administration. These priorities are not merely Republican concerns or Democratic concerns, these are American responsibilities.</p> <p>During the fall campaign, we differed about details of these proposals - but there was remarkable consensus about the important issues before us: excellent schools, retirement and health security, tax relief, a strong military, a more civil society.</p> <p>We've discussed our differences; now it is time to find common ground and build consensus to make America a beacon of opportunity in the 21st century.</p> <p>I'm optimistic this can happen. Our future demands it, and our history proves it. Two hundred years ago, in the election of 1800, America faced another close presidential election. A tie in the electoral college put the outcome into the hands of Congress.</p> <p>After six days of voting, and 36 ballots, the house of representatives elected Thomas Jefferson the third president of the United States. That election brought the first transfer of power from one party to another in our new democracy.</p> <p>Shortly after the election, Jefferson, in a letter titled reconciliation and reform, wrote this: \"the steady character of our countrymen is a rock to which we may safely moor ... unequivocal in principle, reasonable in manner, we shall be able I hope to do a great deal of good to the cause of freedom and harmony.\"</p> <p>Two hundred years have only strengthened the steady character of America. And so as we begin the work of healing our nation, tonight I call upon that character. Respect for each other. Respect for our differences. Generosity of spirit. And a willingness to work hard and work together to solve any problem.</p> <p>I have something else to ask of you, I ask every American. I ask for you to pray for this great nation. I ask your prayers for leaders from both parties.</p> <p>I thank you for your prayers for me and my family, and I ask you to pray for vice president Gore and his family. I have faith that with God's help we as a nation will move forward together, as one nation, indivisible. And together we will create an America that is open, so every citizen has access to the American dream.</p> <p>An America that is educated, so every child has the keys to realise that dream. And an America that is united in our diversity and our shared American values that are larger than race or party.</p> <p>I was not elected to serve one party, but to serve one nation. The president of the United States is the president of every single American, of every race and every background.

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much. Good evening my fellow Americans, I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you tonight. Mr speaker, lieutenant governor, friends, distinguished guests. Our country has been through a long and trying period, with the outcome of the presidential election not finalised for longer than any of us could have ever imagined. Vice president Gore and I put our hearts and hopes into our campaigns; we both gave it our all. We shared similar emotions. I understand how difficult this moment must be for vice president Gore and his family. He has a distinguished record of service to our country as a congressman, a senator and as vice president. This evening I received a gracious call from the vice president. We agreed to meet early next week in Washington and we agreed to do our best to heal our country after this hard fought contest. Tonight, I want to thank all the volunteers and campaign workers who worked so hard on my behalf, I also salute the vice president and his supporters for waging a spirited campaign and I thank him for a call that I know was difficult to make. Laura and I wish the vice president and senator Lieberman and their families the very best. I have a lot to be thankful for tonight. I am thankful for America and thankful that we are able to resolve our electoral differences in a peaceful way. And I am thankful to the American people for the great privilege of being able to serve as your next president. I want to thank my wife and our daughters for their love. Laura's active involvement as first lady has made Texas a better place, and she will be a wonderful first lady for America. I am proud to have Dick Cheney by my side, and America will be proud to have him as our next vice president. Tonight, I chose to speak from the chamber of the Texas house of representatives because it has been a home to bipartisan co-operation. Here, in a place where Democrats have the majority, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to do what is right for the people we represent. We've had spirited disagreements, and in the end, we found constructive consensus. It is an experience I will always carry with me, an example I will always follow. I thank my friend, house speaker Pete Laney, a Democrat, who introduced me today. I want to thank the legislators of both political parties with whom I worked. Across the hall in our Texas capitol is the state senate, and I cannot help but think of our mutual friend, the former Democrat lieutenant governor Bob Bullock. His love for Texas and his ability to work in a bipartisan way continue to be a model for all of us. The spirit of co-operation I have seen in this hall is what is needed in Washington. It is the challenge of our moment. After a difficult election, we must put politics behind us and work together to make the promise of America available for every one of our citizens. I'm optimistic that we can change the tone in Washington DC. I believe things happen for a reason, and I hope the long wait of the last five weeks will heighten a desire to move beyond the bitterness and partisanship of the recent past. Our nation must rise above a house divided. Americans share hopes and goals and values far more important than any political disagreements. Republicans want the best for our nation. And so do Democrats. Our votes may differ, but not our hopes. I know America wants reconciliation and unity. I know Americans want progress. And we must seize this moment and deliver. Together, guided by a spirit of common sense, common courtesy and common goals, we can unite and inspire the American citizens. Together, we will work to make all our public schools excellent, teaching every student of every background and every accent, so that no child is left behind. Together, we will save social security and renew its promise of a secure retirement for generations to come. Together, we will strengthen Medicare and offer prescription drug coverage to all of our seniors. Together, we will give Americans the broad, fair and fiscally responsible tax relief they deserve. Together, we'll have a bipartisan foreign policy true to our values and true to our friends. And we will have a military equal to every challenge, and superior to every adversary. Together, we will address some of society's deepest problems one person at a time, by encouraging and empowering the good hearts and good works of the American people. This is the essence of compassionate conservatism, and it will be a foundation of my administration. These priorities are not merely Republican concerns or Democratic concerns, these are American responsibilities. During the fall campaign, we differed about details of these proposals - but there was remarkable consensus about the important issues before us: excellent schools, retirement and health security, tax relief, a strong military, a more civil society. We've discussed our differences; now it is time to find common ground and build consensus to make America a beacon of opportunity in the 21st century. I'm optimistic this can happen. Our future demands it, and our history proves it. Two hundred years ago, in the election of 1800, America faced another close presidential election. A tie in the electoral college put the outcome into the hands of Congress. After six days of voting, and 36 ballots, the house of representatives elected Thomas Jefferson the third president of the United States. That election brought the first transfer of power from one party to another in our new democracy. Shortly after the election, Jefferson, in a letter titled reconciliation and reform, wrote this: \"the steady character of our countrymen is a rock to which we may safely moor ... unequivocal in principle, reasonable in manner, we shall be able I hope to do a great deal of good to the cause of freedom and harmony.\" Two hundred years have only strengthened the steady character of America. And so as we begin the work of healing our nation, tonight I call upon that character. Respect for each other. Respect for our differences. Generosity of spirit. And a willingness to work hard and work together to solve any problem. I have something else to ask of you, I ask every American. I ask for you to pray for this great nation. I ask your prayers for leaders from both parties. I thank you for your prayers for me and my family, and I ask you to pray for vice president Gore and his family. I have faith that with God's help we as a nation will move forward together, as one nation, indivisible. And together we will create an America that is open, so every citizen has access to the American dream. An America that is educated, so every child has the keys to realise that dream. And an America that is united in our diversity and our shared American values that are larger than race or party. I was not elected to serve one party, but to serve one nation. The president of the United States is the president of every single American, of every race and every background. Whether you voted for me or not, I will do my best to serve your interests, and I will work to earn your respect. I will be guided by president Jefferson's sense of purpose: to stand for principle, to be reasonable in manner, and, above all, to do great good for the cause of freedom and harmony. The presidency is more than an honour, it is more than an office. It is a charge to keep, and I will give it my all. Thank you very much, and God bless America.

Lazio and Bayern Munich sold an average of 41% of seats during the opening stage, with Juventus and Valencia managing 51%. </p> <p>Certainly there is high-level support for slimming down the existing format, which features 157 matches and means the finalists must play 17 times. \"With 32 teams, the Uefa Champions League has become too big, the players have no recovery time and too much is expected of the fans,\" said the Bayern Munich president Franz Beckenbauer.

It also stressed that nothing would alter next season. </p> <p>\"The season after next is a possibility,\" said Mike Lee, Uefa's head of communications, \"but I wouldn't say a strong possibility. The current commercial arrangements and television arrangements run to 2003.\" </p> <p>A survey of supporters carried out by Uefa last month showed that 68% wanted the Champions League to continue in its current format. </p> <p>Uefa's executive committee will also examine the possibility of turning the Uefa Cup into a league competition and is concerned by threats from 11 clubs, including Celtic and Rangers, to form a breakaway \"Euroleague\", which would help guarantee a better redistribution of money from television, sponsorship and marketing. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Although stadiums were fuller for this year's first phase than for last, it has not escaped Aigner's attention that many leading clubs have been playing to small crowds. Lazio and Bayern Munich sold an average of 41% of seats during the opening stage, with Juventus and Valencia managing 51%. Certainly there is high-level support for slimming down the existing format, which features 157 matches and means the finalists must play 17 times. \"With 32 teams, the Uefa Champions League has become too big, the players have no recovery time and too much is expected of the fans,\" said the Bayern Munich president Franz Beckenbauer. Manchester United's chairman Martin Edwards favours a knockout competition after the first round. The Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale, however, jumped to the defence of the existing structure. \"We find it a privilege to be in the competition and we wouldn't change it for anything,\" he said. \"It would be disappointing if, after such a short time with the current format, they started tinkering with it.\" Uefa said yesterday that no alternatives had been drawn up and that change was a matter for discussion and consultation rather than a certainty. It also stressed that nothing would alter next season. \"The season after next is a possibility,\" said Mike Lee, Uefa's head of communications, \"but I wouldn't say a strong possibility. The current commercial arrangements and television arrangements run to 2003.\" A survey of supporters carried out by Uefa last month showed that 68% wanted the Champions League to continue in its current format. Uefa's executive committee will also examine the possibility of turning the Uefa Cup into a league competition and is concerned by threats from 11 clubs, including Celtic and Rangers, to form a breakaway \"Euroleague\", which would help guarantee a better redistribution of money from television, sponsorship and marketing. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

There are increasingly audible whispers that Robinson extracted far cannier terms than Mackay. </p> <p>Mackay yesterday conceded that it was the complexity of the deal which had spooked the markets, and that the structure of the arrangement was designed to prevent Granada from facing a \u00a31.5bn tax bill. </p> <p>The transaction goes like this: two companies merge, spin off Granada Media to leave a focused hospitality group and then sell off all Granada's hotels. </p> <p>The end result, for Compass, is to add a cluster of restaurants and service stations to its contract catering operations. Granada, meanwhile, achieves its ambition of concentrating on \"new economy\" communications. </p> <p>So, why did Mackay go along with such an elaborate tax dodge? In order, he says, to avoid paying a premium for Granada's collection of eateries. </p> <p>It is odd that Compass found these businesses so attractive in the first place - after all, Little Chefs are hardly at the cutting edge of international hospitality. We have it on trust from Compass that after stripping out thousands of esoteric accounting issues, profits from Granada's restaurants rose by a modest 7%. </p> <p>Mackay may eventually succeed in turning motorway service stations into exciting businesses. But after this year's bloodbath in Compass shares, which has been aggravated by a profits warning from Granada Media, it is doubtful whether the year-long transaction will have been worth all the effort put into it. </p> <p>Compass should have stuck to what it does best - doling out hot dogs to unfussy football fans. </p> <p><strong>Lloyds calls tune</strong><br> </p> <p>Terry Eccles of JP Morgan, and Matthew Greenburgh of Merrill Lynch, the oh-so-dynamic investment banking duo promoting Lloyds TSB's phoney bid for Abbey National, have wrapped its chief executive, Ian Harley, in a particularly aggressive bear-hug. </p> <p>Yesterday's menacing statement from Lloyds, while wholly expected, had a clear message: if Abbey tries to merge with its preferred partner, Bank of Scotland, then Lloyds will launch a hostile bid. </p> <p>Since BoS has made it clear that it has no stomach for a three-pronged fight, Lloyds has effectively imposed a stalemate. Mr Harley is faced with a stark choice. He can either sell out to Lloyds, reserving as big a portion of the synergy savings for his shareholders as he can negotiate, and then watch Abbey as we know it razed to the ground. Alternatively, he can try to sit it out, and watch BoS find a new partner - allowing Abbey to slip lower and lower in the banking rankings along the way. </p> <p>Is this fair? In short, no. It is anti-competitive. </p> <p>It is worth noting that in its original letter to Abbey, Lloyds stated categorically that it had received advice that its takeover would receive regulatory clearance. </p> <p>For some reason, this confidence had evaporated from yesterday's statement, which simply said that banking generally is a competitive market and that \"Lloyds TSB would put a submission to the competition authorities for their consideration at the appropriate time.\" </p> <p>This is rather important. Setting price aside, Mr Harley has every justification in doubting whether he should allow Abbey to go through a gruelling four-month competition investigation with no prior indication that the pain and disruption (which has a tangible cost) might be worth it. </p> <p>It is easily forgotten that the Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest deal (which Lloyds' advisers cite as the key precedent-setter) made it through the competition commission during a period when everyone thought the internet was rewriting the business models used by banks and everyone else. </p> <p>Our big lenders thought they were in danger of being Amazoned - a worry which has now subsided. </p> <p>If it is the case that Lloyds' prime motivation in all of this is to prevent an Abbey-BoS merger (and there seems little evidence to the contrary), then the only way Mr Harley will get of the squeeze is by hot-footing it round to the takeover panel. </p> <p>It has a code which is designed to stop such abuses. It is about time it was imposed.</p>",

Granada, meanwhile, achieves its ambition of concentrating on \"new economy\" communications. So, why did Mackay go along with such an elaborate tax dodge? In order, he says, to avoid paying a premium for Granada's collection of eateries. It is odd that Compass found these businesses so attractive in the first place - after all, Little Chefs are hardly at the cutting edge of international hospitality. We have it on trust from Compass that after stripping out thousands of esoteric accounting issues, profits from Granada's restaurants rose by a modest 7%. Mackay may eventually succeed in turning motorway service stations into exciting businesses. But after this year's bloodbath in Compass shares, which has been aggravated by a profits warning from Granada Media, it is doubtful whether the year-long transaction will have been worth all the effort put into it. Compass should have stuck to what it does best - doling out hot dogs to unfussy football fans. Lloyds calls tune Terry Eccles of JP Morgan, and Matthew Greenburgh of Merrill Lynch, the oh-so-dynamic investment banking duo promoting Lloyds TSB's phoney bid for Abbey National, have wrapped its chief executive, Ian Harley, in a particularly aggressive bear-hug. Yesterday's menacing statement from Lloyds, while wholly expected, had a clear message: if Abbey tries to merge with its preferred partner, Bank of Scotland, then Lloyds will launch a hostile bid. Since BoS has made it clear that it has no stomach for a three-pronged fight, Lloyds has effectively imposed a stalemate. Mr Harley is faced with a stark choice. He can either sell out to Lloyds, reserving as big a portion of the synergy savings for his shareholders as he can negotiate, and then watch Abbey as we know it razed to the ground. Alternatively, he can try to sit it out, and watch BoS find a new partner - allowing Abbey to slip lower and lower in the banking rankings along the way. Is this fair? In short, no. It is anti-competitive. It is worth noting that in its original letter to Abbey, Lloyds stated categorically that it had received advice that its takeover would receive regulatory clearance. For some reason, this confidence had evaporated from yesterday's statement, which simply said that banking generally is a competitive market and that \"Lloyds TSB would put a submission to the competition authorities for their consideration at the appropriate time.\" This is rather important. Setting price aside, Mr Harley has every justification in doubting whether he should allow Abbey to go through a gruelling four-month competition investigation with no prior indication that the pain and disruption (which has a tangible cost) might be worth it. It is easily forgotten that the Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest deal (which Lloyds' advisers cite as the key precedent-setter) made it through the competition commission during a period when everyone thought the internet was rewriting the business models used by banks and everyone else. Our big lenders thought they were in danger of being Amazoned - a worry which has now subsided. If it is the case that Lloyds' prime motivation in all of this is to prevent an Abbey-BoS merger (and there seems little evidence to the contrary), then the only way Mr Harley will get of the squeeze is by hot-footing it round to the takeover panel. It has a code which is designed to stop such abuses. It is about time it was imposed.",

      "bodyText": "The Equitable Life crisis deepened last night when the Liberal Democrats accused the financial services authority of \"failing to protect consumers\" and raised the issue of possible compensation to policyholders who have lost out. As worried Equitable customers continued to flood the insurer with calls, Dr Vincent Cable MP, the Liberal Democrat shadow trade and industry secretary, said there \"seems to be evidence of serious regulatory negligence\" on the part of the FSA which needs to be investigated. Some commentators have claimed the watchdog should have taken earlier action against the insurer and criticised its decision to allow Equitable to carry on selling new policies until late last week. There have also been reports - denied by the FSA - that the regulator allegedly approved accounting procedures that allowed Equitable artificially to boost its capital base last year, making it appear more financially robust. Howard Davies, the FSA chairman, this week defended the watchdog's handling of the crisis, saying it had acted \"appropriately\". But Dr Cable said this was the latest incident in which the FSA had \"taken its eye off the ball and failed to act to protect small investors\". He added that if it is established that there has been a regulatory failure, there would be \"a very strong moral obligation\" on the government to pay compensation to those who have lost out as a result of its incompetence. Equitable has left many policyholders worried and confused after warning up to 1m of them that they can expect lower investment returns in future, and will be hit with a 10% penalty if they transfer their funds to another provider. Dr Cable has pledged to pursue the issue during a Commons adjournment debate on the subject of Equitable scheduled to take place on Tuesday. Yesterday also saw the FSA say that it is on the look-out for unscrupulous investment firms that may be exploiting the Equitable Life crisis by \"unnecessarily panicking\" policyholders into moving their money away from the insurer. The City watchdog said it is monitoring rival insurance companies and independent financial advisers because of concern that some might try to pressurise policyholders into \"making an unwise choice\". Equitable last night denied it was seeing a flood of customers seeking to move their money. \"[There is] no indication of people rushing away,\" said a company spokesman. On Friday Equitable closed its doors to new business and announced it was changing its investment strategy after failing to find a buyer.",

Insomniac's third and last Spyro game will appeal to players of all ages and sexes, and all skill levels. The only essentials are a PlayStation and a sense of humour. </p> <p>And YOTD is not just a cute platform game, it's a compendium of great mini-games, ranging from a superb skateboard park - and a dragon pulling stunts is well worth seeing - to a pastiche of Quake. (Not so strange: Insomniac's first game was a shooter called Disruptor.) </p> <p>It doesn't get five stars because the basic game is the same as it was in the first two Spyro titles. You play a small purple fire-breathing dragon, and you run, fly and swim around well-drawn 3D cartoon worlds collecting jewels and bashing bad guys. </p> <p>Your task is to save about 150 eggs, each of which gives birth to a small Pok\u00e9mon-type animated creature, which promptly disappears. </p> <p>But you're not stuck with being Spyro forever. In one level in each world you play a different character such as Sheila (a kangaroo), Sergeant Byrd (a flying penguin), Bently (a yeti), and Agent 9 (a space monkey). </p> <p>Although YOTD does not have the rich inventiveness of the Sonic and Super Mario series, the different characters and the wide range of mini-games provide a lot of variety. </p> <p>Insomniac has also done a good job of making YOTD accessible to all-comers. </p> <p>The opening level is instantly playable, and there are characters standing around to tell you which buttons to push if you get stuck. </p> <p>The game also features an \"auto challenge tuning\" (ACT) system that is said to adjust the difficulty level to the player's expertise. The company says it means the game can provide a challenge for hardcore gamers without becoming unplayable by the rest of us. However, as a solo player, you can't tell whether ACT is doing anything or not. </p> <p>The gameplay is great, the graphics are superb, the voice acting better than average, and the background tunes don't seem to get too annoying, which all adds up to an outstanding game. </p> <p>The first Spyro title has now shifted about 4 million copies world wide, and YOTD deserves to do even better. (JS)</p> <p><strong> Tom &amp; Jerry in House Trap</strong> <br>Sony PlayStation \u00a319.99 Ubisoft ***<br> In the red corner: you know them, you love them, they are arguably the perfect videogame material - the ultra-violent cartoon cat and mouse, Tom and Jerry. In the blue corner: the depressing, time-honoured videogames dictum that All Merchandising Licences Are Dire. </p> <p>So who wins? Boringly, neither. Things sure could have been worse: for a start, the delinquent duo have not been spuriously transplanted into a new milieu (although Tom &amp; Jerry Racer and Kat &amp; Mouse Kombat are doubtless in the pipeline). No, in House Trap, Tom and Jerry are firmly where they belong - in their house, using household implements to beat seven bells out of each other. </p> <p>What's more, the game does a decent job of capturing the essence of the 40s toon (we do not, ah, mention the 60s remake). The visuals, the sound effects, even the chirpy music are within forgiving distance of the real deal. </p> <p>Even better, the game itself is fun, frenetic and, blow me, mildly original. Playing on a split screen, you take the part of Jerry against the computer's Tom (in two-player mode, a friend takes Tom). The object is simple: use everything at your disposal (lawnmower, drawing pins, ironing board) to set traps for your opponent. If the traps fail, you can always pick up the nearest domestic item (bowling ball, goldfish bowl) and beat him over the head. </p> <p>So much for the cheese. Now for the trap: sorely limited gameplay. The action stretches over just 15 rooms, most of which offer similarly superficial slapstick (face flattened by frying pan, face flattened by shovel, yada yada). The single-player campaign becomes repetitive long before the end, and even EastEnders fans will tire of the two-player option eventually. (A four-player option with Spike and the cute little duck on the other hand...) </p> <p>All in all, House Trap is a good laugh, which, with just a little more inventiveness and variety, could have been a great one. Still, it's only \u00a320. (AB)</p> <p> <strong> Timesplitters</strong><br> Sony PlayStation 2 \u00a339.99 Eidos *** <br> The PlayStation 2, then. A new dawn of interactive entertainment, or just an overpriced DVD player? </p> <p>Despite the machine's undoubted potential, the PS2's launch games haven't exactly set the world alight.

But, while the computer opponents display a devious amount of artificial intelligence (AI), Timesplitters is best played against humans, especially when showing signs of IS (inebriated stupidity). </p> <p>Indeed, the multiplayer game, in all its guises - from deathmatch to capture the flag - is where the lack of plotline makes sense. Kill or be killed, move or die, Timesplitters is gaming in its most (im)pure form. </p> <p>As you would expect from the developer's history, there are lots of extra bits to discover as you play through the game, with immense satisfaction gained from finding a new character or weapon. </p> <p>So, plot or not, there is plenty to do.

      "body": "<p>He is the self-appointed champion of the homeless, a former rough sleeper who found fame as founder of the Big Issue. Now, John Bird MBE says the next front in the fight against homelessness is cyberspace - and he's going to launch a raft of websites to prove it. </p> <p>It's 10am, Tuesday morning at a famous black cab caf\u00e9 near Euston Station. An unlikely time and place for a press conference, maybe. But a huddle of photographers, reporters and supportive friends have gathered for the launch of <a href=\"http://ABCtales.com/\" target=\"_new\">ABCtales.com</a>, Bird's new storytelling website and literary magazine. There is no champagne, but a fair bit of backslapping as Bird swaps quips with the cabbies. They tell the tallest tales in London, he says with a wink. </p> <p>\"The reason I'm doing all this is because the Big Issue has only had one product for nine years,\" explains Bird. \"We need to find a way of creating wealth and opportunity for homeless people as there are few big providers of work for the homeless out there.\" </p> <p>To do this, Bird explains that he has formed a new company with chair of the Body Shop Gordon Roddick and Red Pepper supremo Tony Cook. The trio have raised nearly \u00a3500,000 of venture capital to create Burgeon Creative Ideas (BCI). Half will go on ABCtales and the rest will be distributed between a number of other sites. </p> <p>Bird says ABCtales will make money through a combination of advertising, sponsorship and e-tailing. It is a storytelling site that asks its users to upload stories. Even before its official launch, the site has attracted nearly 10,000 visits a week. It has 300 stories ready for publication and has received stories from as far away as Hanoi and San Francisco. The best stories on the site will be published in a monthly magazine, to be given away free on the tube and in the Body Shop. </p> <p>The site also plans to publish anthologies of the best writing from the website. Bird anticipates that it will take two to three years to see any profits. </p> <p>Bird claims BCI will help the homeless in two ways. First, 20% of post-investment profits will be poured back into the Big Issue. </p> <p>Second, the company will act as an incubator for a number of new media sites. Initially, the sites will be commissioned and built in-house, but if profitable, Bird claims pitches from the homeless will be actively encouraged. The other 80% of potential profits will be shared among the staff of each site. At the moment Bird gets a wage from the Big Issue, but no dividends. </p> <p>ABCtales is the second website launch in a month for Bird. Two weeks ago saw the launch of <a href=\"http://www.getethical.com\" target=\"_new\">Get Ethical</a> - a kind of virtual Arndale Centre that aims to \"promote and advance ethical capitalism.\" The Big Issue (ie not BCI) bought a 28% stake in the site, which is owned by the left/green political magazine Red Pepper.

      "bodyText": "He is the self-appointed champion of the homeless, a former rough sleeper who found fame as founder of the Big Issue. Now, John Bird MBE says the next front in the fight against homelessness is cyberspace - and he's going to launch a raft of websites to prove it. It's 10am, Tuesday morning at a famous black cab caf\u00e9 near Euston Station. An unlikely time and place for a press conference, maybe. But a huddle of photographers, reporters and supportive friends have gathered for the launch of ABCtales.com, Bird's new storytelling website and literary magazine. There is no champagne, but a fair bit of backslapping as Bird swaps quips with the cabbies. They tell the tallest tales in London, he says with a wink. \"The reason I'm doing all this is because the Big Issue has only had one product for nine years,\" explains Bird. \"We need to find a way of creating wealth and opportunity for homeless people as there are few big providers of work for the homeless out there.\" To do this, Bird explains that he has formed a new company with chair of the Body Shop Gordon Roddick and Red Pepper supremo Tony Cook. The trio have raised nearly \u00a3500,000 of venture capital to create Burgeon Creative Ideas (BCI). Half will go on ABCtales and the rest will be distributed between a number of other sites. Bird says ABCtales will make money through a combination of advertising, sponsorship and e-tailing. It is a storytelling site that asks its users to upload stories. Even before its official launch, the site has attracted nearly 10,000 visits a week. It has 300 stories ready for publication and has received stories from as far away as Hanoi and San Francisco. The best stories on the site will be published in a monthly magazine, to be given away free on the tube and in the Body Shop. The site also plans to publish anthologies of the best writing from the website. Bird anticipates that it will take two to three years to see any profits. Bird claims BCI will help the homeless in two ways. First, 20% of post-investment profits will be poured back into the Big Issue. Second, the company will act as an incubator for a number of new media sites. Initially, the sites will be commissioned and built in-house, but if profitable, Bird claims pitches from the homeless will be actively encouraged. The other 80% of potential profits will be shared among the staff of each site. At the moment Bird gets a wage from the Big Issue, but no dividends. ABCtales is the second website launch in a month for Bird. Two weeks ago saw the launch of Get Ethical - a kind of virtual Arndale Centre that aims to \"promote and advance ethical capitalism.\" The Big Issue (ie not BCI) bought a 28% stake in the site, which is owned by the left/green political magazine Red Pepper. The site has been live for two weeks. \"Everybody's always banging on about giving people things. But if you are a giver then you create takers, if you create takers then you create dependency,\" says Bird. \"I'm not saying that business is the answer to all things, but I don't think charity is either. We can come up with a hybrid that uses business acumen and skills to create work and social transformation and at the same time have charitable intentions.\" The conversion from old-style social entrepreneur to new media wannabe started when Bird was in Los Angeles, struggling to establish a LA version of the Big Issue. \"I found that I couldn't get anyone to sell the paper because homeless people didn't warm to this neon sign above them saying 'failure',\" he admits. So Bird began employing homeless workers (in the UK vendors work freelance), starting them as distributors, then training them up to work in an office. This was when Bird began to see the internet, in particular some of the wealth creation schemes of the new economy, as a potential source of employment for homeless people. Ideas for other sites are in the pipeline. In February the company will launch a site with the working title of Dr Checkoff. A bright idea that will attempt to collect the 101 most useful checklists (buying a house, coping with the menopause, questions to ask your insurance broker, and so on). The site will be launched in the US first, and in the UK in April. Bird says he will then launch another website and magazine based around reviews provided by the general public. Beyond that, Bird wants to move into investment banking and he is currently under consideration by the Financial Services Authority. He has already formed another company - Social Brokers Limited - that he intends to grow into an investment bank, to fund entrepreneurial projects that will benefit homeless people. Also, the Big Issue will be expanding its website. The magazine will not be going online, but Bird says he wants to turn it into \"a powerful campaigning website\". True, Bird wants to make some money for himself and, true, it will take more than a few websites to get tens of thousands off the streets of our towns and cities. But there is no doubt that the down and outs' current champion caught more than a bit of sunshine while he was out in California. So with Christmas around the corner and a government campaign urging people not to give to beggars, what should we do? Give to charity or give spare change in the street? Consider another solution, says Bird. If you can, why not give an opportunity instead?",

Toybuilders began when owner Karl Denton's daughter Shelby told him she wanted a sceptre and crown, just like one she had seen on television. However, she could not remember the name of the show. On a computer, Karl and his daughter started to draw a new sceptre. \"We used a computer-aided design program that let us make the three-dimensional model,\" recalls Denton. \"We then picked colours for it, and I sent it away to a company that had machinery capable of taking the image and making it into something physical.\"</p> <p> Toybuilders now builds all kinds of toys, as well as action dolls, with each new model priced individually. The toys range in price from $25 to $25,000. \"Having set up Toybuilders, the aim was that people would send in their children's drawings and we could make them into three-dimensional objects,\" says Denton. \"I knew the idea would be limited by what ideas people came up with, but even I was surprised by what people started asking me to do.\" Particularly popular are new pieces for Monopoly sets - from replicas of the owners' houses to game pieces that look like items of furniture, or even members of the family. </p> <p>There were also requests for chess sets made up of family mementoes, as well as pieces for role-playing games and Cluedo. \"It was only a matter of time before someone requested an action doll with their likeness,\" says Denton. \"That has started to happen with loved ones getting dolls made of their partners, artists getting dolls made of their own creations and so on. \"We make them, then add specific details, and then make clothing as requested. It can be normal clothes, job specific clothes or soccer strips, as long as we have pictures for reference.\" (CM)</p>",

The phone has a talktime of 2.5 to 4.5 hours and a stand-by time of 55 to 260 hours. It is available via most networks priced at around \u00a3150. Telly surfers French TV viewers will soon be able to surf the net and send emails using Microsoft software. The company has teamed up with set manufacturer Thomson to launch 12 new televisions in France that sport an interactive facility called TAK. The service, a joint venture between Microsoft and Thomson, also gives the user access to a range of interactive facilities, including an on-screen TV guide. The duo intends to roll out televisions featuring TAK technology across Europe in the next 12 months. A UK launch is expected in 2001. In addition to full net access via the set's on-board modem, the service enables each family member to have an individual mailbox and has the ability to view different types of attachments. (AN) Toys are you Web company Toybuilders has come up with what it believes is the most origianl present you can buy - a doll-sized replica of yourself. Toybuilders takes pictures of customers and then converts that image into plastic and makes a 12-inch doll, dressed in similar clothing to the owner. Toybuilders began when owner Karl Denton's daughter Shelby told him she wanted a sceptre and crown, just like one she had seen on television. However, she could not remember the name of the show. On a computer, Karl and his daughter started to draw a new sceptre. \"We used a computer-aided design program that let us make the three-dimensional model,\" recalls Denton. \"We then picked colours for it, and I sent it away to a company that had machinery capable of taking the image and making it into something physical.\" Toybuilders now builds all kinds of toys, as well as action dolls, with each new model priced individually. The toys range in price from $25 to $25,000. \"Having set up Toybuilders, the aim was that people would send in their children's drawings and we could make them into three-dimensional objects,\" says Denton. \"I knew the idea would be limited by what ideas people came up with, but even I was surprised by what people started asking me to do.\" Particularly popular are new pieces for Monopoly sets - from replicas of the owners' houses to game pieces that look like items of furniture, or even members of the family. There were also requests for chess sets made up of family mementoes, as well as pieces for role-playing games and Cluedo. \"It was only a matter of time before someone requested an action doll with their likeness,\" says Denton. \"That has started to happen with loved ones getting dolls made of their partners, artists getting dolls made of their own creations and so on. \"We make them, then add specific details, and then make clothing as requested. It can be normal clothes, job specific clothes or soccer strips, as long as we have pictures for reference.\" (CM)",

      "byline": "Victor Keegan",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The single pervasive theme of the 21st century has already been decided. It is the Digital Divide and whether it can be bridged. Seldom has a potential social malaise engaged so many minds everywhere at the same time. It is as if concerned people around the world have simultaneously decided not only that the problem should be solved but that it actually can be. </p> <p>Every one is getting in on the act, from the United Nations and the Group of Eight at the top, to university departments and community groups at the other end of the scale. In Britain, Tony Blair has promised \"universal access\" (whatever that means) by 2005 and is putting plenty of money where his mouth is - including \u00a3250m for disadvantaged communities to go online, \u00a3250m to train teachers, and increased pressure on BT to deliver broadband. </p> <p>But what medium is best suited to deliver universal access? The PC may peak at around 60% penetration and digital television is unlikely to cover more than 70% of the population, leaving 30% disenfranchised. </p> <p>Most social problems of this magnitude are only debated after the event. It is only when global developments have produced social chasms - whether involving health, wealth, gender or ethnicity - that the conscience of the world is stirred and remedies explored. The digital divide is unusual in that a solution is being sought in real time - while the revolution itself is being unrolled. </p> <p>The initial success is mildly encouraging, at least in the industrialised world, even though it has been triggered by the driving force of the technology rather than human endeavour. The speed at which people in richer countries have adopted the net is far faster than adoption rates for previous technologies such as telegraph, radio, television, fax and video. </p> <p>Fast adoption has been driven by rapidly improving technology in all the key areas - computers, telecommunications, storage, bandwidth, digital cameras etc - accompanied by an equally rapid fall in real prices. </p> <p>Within some subsections of the IT revolution the adoption rates, particularly among youngsters, has been phenomenal. Sending text messages by mobile phone, unheard of 18 months ago, has now reached 10bn, overtaking email in popularity. </p> <p>Since mobile phone penetration has already reached 90% among some categories of young people, the problem of digital disadvantage has been solved even before companies and governments have started to work out what role phones should have in the digital revolution. </p> <p>That is exceptional but it underlines the fact that there is no single digital divide but lots of overlapping ones: between old and young, men and women, rich and poor, blacks and whites, northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere and, above all, between developed and developing nations. </p> <p>This is the area where the creation of a vast new underprivileged digitariat, even more dispossessed than now seems inevitable unless dramatic action is taken. </p> <p>The bald statistics are depressingly familiar: barely 2% of the world's population of more than 6bn are linked to the internet; most people on the planet have not even made a telephone call, let alone accessed the web; there are more telephone lines in a big city like Tokyo than in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa. In the US, internet access costs a user only 1% of average monthly income, whereas in Uganda it costs more than a month's average (per capita) income. </p> <p>Most of the new business opportunities in the next few decades will either be the creation of digital goods (such as music, audio and films) or the application of digital and internet techniques to old economy products (such as mapping and monitoring systems in cars or intelligent fridges). Those developing countries whom the internet has passed by, will be doubly hit by all this. They will not be making any of the new economy goods that people increasingly want to buy, while at the same time their traditional markets (such as commodities) will be squeezed by the price deflation brought about by the creation of giant electronic marketplaces on the internet. Meanwhile, what little international investment has been going their way will be diverted to the more exciting prospects (even after the experience of the past year) of internet-related projects generated by the information-rich countries. </p> <p>The US provides a strong contrast with the prospects for the Third World. According to the organisation monitoring the <a href=\"http://www.digitaldivide.gov/\">digital divide</a>, the share of households with internet access has soared from 26.2% in December 1998 to 41.5% in August this year. More than half of all households now have computers. But the interesting thing is that while net access is still disproportionately the prerogative of richer people, the digital divide is being tackled. During the most recently recorded 20 months, the number of black households with internet access at home has more than doubled from 11.2% to 23.5%. Hispanic households have experienced similar growth (from 12.6% to 23.6%). This is still way behind the access of white households and also Asian and Pacific Islanders, who have the highest access rates of all (56.8%), but it is moving in the right direction. </p> <p>In Britain, a Guardian/ICM poll earlier this year predicted that almost half of all adults in the UK would be online early next year. But, whereas 59% of the most affluent AB social group would be online, only 14% of the poorest DE social class, which includes the unskilled, would be in a similar position. However, Professor Patrick Dunleavy of LSE reminds us, that all expensive new goods sell first to the wealthy classes. He points to figures from the British Market Research Bureau showing that in the year to mid-1999 the growth in internet access was 33% for the rich AB social group but 44% for C1s and 44% for C2s. Even among the retired and unemployed DE group access grew by 50% over that period. In August 2000 the proportion of ABs and C1s who used the net during the previous month rose by 33% compared with a year earlier, while C2s, Ds and Es rose by 70% to 80%. </p> <p>George Gilder, the US guru, argues that the wealthiest 20% are paying for all the false starts and glitches that plague any new technology, thus bringing it down the learning curve, where everyone else can get it a few years later at a quarter the price. He says:\"That's the digital divide. The rich provide the investment and the rest reap the rewards.\" </p> <p>David Elstein, former head of Channel Five, told a roundtable on the digital divide (reported in this week's New Statesman) that every new innovation, from radio to the Consumers' Association, divides society. Online evangelists, he claimed, had not yet proved what you needed to do for the net revolution that you did not for the others. </p> <p> The answer, maybe, is that not having electricity or a phone in an industrialising society is less of a handicap than net access because of the all- pervasive nature of the new revolution. Not to have access to information in an information-driven age, when most jobs require techie or keyboarding skills, is to risk total exclusion. Information moves so fast these days that sending an email has a definite advantage over a letter. </p> <p>In the information economy, knowledge is vital and most of it is locked inside peoples' heads. That is partly why the dot.com companies were so ludicrously overvalued this year. But once knowledge becomes a digital product - a document, a music file or a video - it can be transmitted instantly to millions of consumers at no extra cost. </p> <p>This offers a tantalising prospect for the Third World. Countries in Africa which, 150 years on, have not yet even experienced the effects of the industrial revolution, have the potential to leapfrog into the information age. Some indeed are already starting to experiment (see Online, page 12). It is not necessary any longer to have an expensive network of copper wires because the wireless revolution can beam appropriate information to remote villages from some of the satellites that fly over Africa virtually unused. What is needed is a new generation of international social entrepreneurs to harness the unused technology of the multi-nationals to the needs of the poorest countries. </p> <p>Of course, as Bill Gates has pointed out, what deprived people need is not computers but basic things such as medicine. Jubilee 2000 has pointed out that you could vaccinate 2,000 children against six killer diseases for the price of a computer. That is true. Also, as Kevin Watkins of Oxfam points out, in much of sub-Saharan Africa more than half of primary-age children are denied the opportunity of even a rudimentary primary education and fewer than one third make it to secondary school. </p> <p>All of this puts technology transfer in a depressing context.

      "bodyText": "The single pervasive theme of the 21st century has already been decided. It is the Digital Divide and whether it can be bridged. Seldom has a potential social malaise engaged so many minds everywhere at the same time. It is as if concerned people around the world have simultaneously decided not only that the problem should be solved but that it actually can be. Every one is getting in on the act, from the United Nations and the Group of Eight at the top, to university departments and community groups at the other end of the scale. In Britain, Tony Blair has promised \"universal access\" (whatever that means) by 2005 and is putting plenty of money where his mouth is - including \u00a3250m for disadvantaged communities to go online, \u00a3250m to train teachers, and increased pressure on BT to deliver broadband. But what medium is best suited to deliver universal access? The PC may peak at around 60% penetration and digital television is unlikely to cover more than 70% of the population, leaving 30% disenfranchised. Most social problems of this magnitude are only debated after the event. It is only when global developments have produced social chasms - whether involving health, wealth, gender or ethnicity - that the conscience of the world is stirred and remedies explored. The digital divide is unusual in that a solution is being sought in real time - while the revolution itself is being unrolled. The initial success is mildly encouraging, at least in the industrialised world, even though it has been triggered by the driving force of the technology rather than human endeavour. The speed at which people in richer countries have adopted the net is far faster than adoption rates for previous technologies such as telegraph, radio, television, fax and video. Fast adoption has been driven by rapidly improving technology in all the key areas - computers, telecommunications, storage, bandwidth, digital cameras etc - accompanied by an equally rapid fall in real prices.

      "body": "<p>The way John Ciba learned that his 30 years as a Vauxhall employee could end in 15 months time hurt almost as much as the message itself.</p> <p>\"The phone rang yesterday at about one o'clock,\" he said. \"I was getting ready for my shift and it was my daughter. She said: 'You'd better switch on the radio, dad, there's something about the plant closing'.\"</p> <p>Standing outside the plant that has dominated Luton's skyline for 95 years and buffeted by a chill wind, he said: \"So I switched it on and I heard about it that way, through the media. That's typical Vauxhall. The girl on the checkout in Safeway knew before the workers did. It's gutless and it's heartbreaking.\"</p> <p>Mr Ciba has been making the journey up St Anne's Hill to the plant from his home near Luton since he was an apprentice. He says he has become used to being let down by Vauxhall. But he never expected that the Luton plant, held up as a model of productivity by unions and management alike, would close. This year workers received a \u00a3700 profit share payment and last year the firm made an underlying profit of \u00a380m.</p> <p>Much of this, says Mr Ciba, is down to the hard work, flexibility and tolerance of staff. \"We've given them everything they've asked for. When they asked us to double up on the line, effectively doing two men's jobs, we did. We've agreed to do it all and this is how we're rewarded.\"</p> <p>Many of his contemporaries at the Luton plant share his fear that this job will be the last. \"At 51 I'm not going to get another job am I? And if I don't get a pension then what good is a payout of 40 grand? That will all be gone by the time I'm retirement age. The problem is I either accept the offer they put on the table or I'm out of work in 15 months. It's not much of a choice.\"</p> <p>He feels let down by the Labour government and its failure to adopt the social chapter in full. The feeling of colleagues is that Luton's workers are cheaper to sack than their German counterparts and that they are helpless in the face of decisions taken far off in Detroit.</p> <p>One union convener at the plant described the move as \"the unacceptable face of globalisation\", a feeling echoed by the hundreds who stood to heckle and vent their anger yesterday evening at Nick Reilly, the firm's UK chairman.</p> <p>\"We've been sold down the river and there's nothing you can do about it,\" cried one man. Mr Reilly could only nod his tacit agreement.</p> <p>Bill McKenzie, the leader of Luton council, fears the bleak future for Vauxhall workers will be shared by others in the town. Fifteen years ago it used to be said that when Vauxhall caught a cold the whole town sneezed; the plant has since lost importance for the area but the ancillary industries that thrive off it could see up to 5,000 jobs lost.</p> <p>\"This is a real blow for the town. The impact on morale has already been huge,\" Mr McKenzie said. \"Vauxhall has been a pillar of Luton for nearly a century, but now it seems the lights are going out. We'll survive though, this is a tough town and somehow we'll be stronger for this.\"</p> <p>He has some reason to be optimistic. Vauxhall ceased to be the town's main employer after the expansion in the 1990s of Luton airport. Home to budget airline Easyjet, the airport now employs about 8,000. Some 35,000 people are working in the service industry, and there are another 12,500 employed in manufacturing.</p> <p>Nevertheless for those like Pamela Pugh, owner of the Greedy Guts cafe on Kimpton Road, alongside the plant, replacing the hole left by Vauxhall will not be easy.</p> <p>\"I've been here eight and a half years and at least 50% of my business comes from Vauxhall or associated workers. I think it's going to be bleak,\" Ms Pugh said.\"People here now are very depressed and they don't know what the future's going to hold. It's all right for some of the younger lads who will be able to get jobs, but for the older blokes it's going to be a tough time.\"</p> <p>Above her cafe counter she had hung a Happy Christmas banner which she had rearranged into an anagram. It read \"This Crappy Sham\". \"Just about sums up this year, doesn't it?\" she said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The way John Ciba learned that his 30 years as a Vauxhall employee could end in 15 months time hurt almost as much as the message itself. \"The phone rang yesterday at about one o'clock,\" he said. \"I was getting ready for my shift and it was my daughter. She said: 'You'd better switch on the radio, dad, there's something about the plant closing'.\" Standing outside the plant that has dominated Luton's skyline for 95 years and buffeted by a chill wind, he said: \"So I switched it on and I heard about it that way, through the media. That's typical Vauxhall. The girl on the checkout in Safeway knew before the workers did. It's gutless and it's heartbreaking.\" Mr Ciba has been making the journey up St Anne's Hill to the plant from his home near Luton since he was an apprentice. He says he has become used to being let down by Vauxhall. But he never expected that the Luton plant, held up as a model of productivity by unions and management alike, would close. This year workers received a \u00a3700 profit share payment and last year the firm made an underlying profit of \u00a380m. Much of this, says Mr Ciba, is down to the hard work, flexibility and tolerance of staff. \"We've given them everything they've asked for. When they asked us to double up on the line, effectively doing two men's jobs, we did. We've agreed to do it all and this is how we're rewarded.\" Many of his contemporaries at the Luton plant share his fear that this job will be the last. \"At 51 I'm not going to get another job am I? And if I don't get a pension then what good is a payout of 40 grand? That will all be gone by the time I'm retirement age. The problem is I either accept the offer they put on the table or I'm out of work in 15 months. It's not much of a choice.\" He feels let down by the Labour government and its failure to adopt the social chapter in full. The feeling of colleagues is that Luton's workers are cheaper to sack than their German counterparts and that they are helpless in the face of decisions taken far off in Detroit. One union convener at the plant described the move as \"the unacceptable face of globalisation\", a feeling echoed by the hundreds who stood to heckle and vent their anger yesterday evening at Nick Reilly, the firm's UK chairman. \"We've been sold down the river and there's nothing you can do about it,\" cried one man. Mr Reilly could only nod his tacit agreement. Bill McKenzie, the leader of Luton council, fears the bleak future for Vauxhall workers will be shared by others in the town. Fifteen years ago it used to be said that when Vauxhall caught a cold the whole town sneezed; the plant has since lost importance for the area but the ancillary industries that thrive off it could see up to 5,000 jobs lost. \"This is a real blow for the town. The impact on morale has already been huge,\" Mr McKenzie said. \"Vauxhall has been a pillar of Luton for nearly a century, but now it seems the lights are going out. We'll survive though, this is a tough town and somehow we'll be stronger for this.\" He has some reason to be optimistic. Vauxhall ceased to be the town's main employer after the expansion in the 1990s of Luton airport. Home to budget airline Easyjet, the airport now employs about 8,000. Some 35,000 people are working in the service industry, and there are another 12,500 employed in manufacturing. Nevertheless for those like Pamela Pugh, owner of the Greedy Guts cafe on Kimpton Road, alongside the plant, replacing the hole left by Vauxhall will not be easy. \"I've been here eight and a half years and at least 50% of my business comes from Vauxhall or associated workers. I think it's going to be bleak,\" Ms Pugh said.\"People here now are very depressed and they don't know what the future's going to hold. It's all right for some of the younger lads who will be able to get jobs, but for the older blokes it's going to be a tough time.\" Above her cafe counter she had hung a Happy Christmas banner which she had rearranged into an anagram. It read \"This Crappy Sham\". \"Just about sums up this year, doesn't it?\" she said.",

On the eve of a key meeting in Brussels, the foreign ministry in Paris insisted that planning for the EU's nascent rapid reaction force be \"independent\" of Nato. The latest French statement came as the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, again warned against \"decoupling\" the US from Europe. Mrs Albright, meeting fellow ministers today, said that Nato risked becoming a \"relic of history\" if the EU set up a caucus within the alliance and established rival structures. Nato diplomats are furious at the way France has tried to put the maximum distance between the planned 60,000-strong force and the alliance, despite a commitment by the EU's 15 member states to a \"strategic partnership\" between the two.

      "bodyText": "The government will order an effective takeover of Railtrack operations by the strategic rail authority if the company's recovery plan is not working by the end of January. Downing Street said it would use new powers in the Transport Act that come into force in February to instruct the strategic rail authority to produce its own recovery strategy for Railtrack. In theory the SRA could order Railtrack to lift many of its speed restrictions, but is unlikely to do so unless it has the support of the health and safety executive. The threat backs up Tony Blair's promise in an ITN interview to get a grip on the railways if timetables are not returning to normal by the end of January. However, the suspicion remains that the government does not in reality have a detailed plan available to coerce Railtrack. Lord Macdonald, the transport minister, is strongly opposed to the government taking a financial stake in Railtrack, even though over 70 Labour backbenchers are backing the move. In the Commons, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said the SRA would be producing a strategic plan for the railways at the end of January, which would \"make for a more modern railway\". The threats came as the transport select committee delivered a vitriolic broadside against the quality of Railtrack management, accusing them of staggering from one crisis to another. The committee accused the company of losing sight of its \"core responsibility\" to run a safe and efficient railway in the run up to October's Hatfield crash. Railtrack suffered from \"systematic, often-repeated failings in the company's management systems and leadership which the resignation of Gerald Corbett as chief executive and a cosmetic reshuffling of the board will not resolve\". The MPs attacked the make up of the Railtrack board, with only two of the seven executive directors having had significant experience in the rail industry, while just one was a qualified engineer. The report said the appointment of the board's only engineer, commercial director Richard Middleton, to the new post of technical director did not go far enough, and that more senior people were needed with \"knowledge and experience appropriate for running the railway\". The report also attacked Railtrack's management of contractors Balfour Beatty, responsible for maintenance on the east coast main line where the Hatfield crash occurred, saying controls had been \"totally inadequate\". The committee did not take a clear view on whether Railtrack should bring in sub-contracted maintenance back in house. But it said the sudden programme of 3,000 track inpsections suggested that \"it is not confident that its contractors have adequately maintained the network. Railtrack responded: \"We remain of the belief that the actions taken were correct and the imposition of speed restrictions was taken to protect passengers while we assessed the implications of what had happened at Hatfield.\" The company added that it believed it was \"in a position to make the right judgments on which speed limits can be raised\".",

      "bodyText": "The governmment is to ask for \u00a3200m from the national lottery to help cover the disastrous bankrolling of the Millennium Dome, which twice nearly went bankrupt this year. The announcement will be made today by Lord McIntosh, the culture minister in the House of Lords, and will be coupled with a move to extend the life of the millennium commission for the next eight months. Lord Falconer, the dome minister, who has been severely criticised for his handling of the project, is expected to be present but silent on the issue. The need for the extra money follows the transfer of \u00a3179m from the commission in the last year to bail out the dome. Two of the extra transactions, totalling \u00a376m, were opposed by Mike O'Connor, the commission's director. The proposal for extra cash is to be fiercely contested by the Tories, who have tabled a motion opposing the move. If successful, the motion would force the millennium commission to close down on New Year's Eve, the last day the dome is open. The extra cash for the dome has left the commission short of the money it had agreed to invest in new projects that need funding next year. Altogether the commission was given \u00a32.1bn to invest in thousands of projects across the country. This will now have to rise to \u00a32.3bn to ensure that final tranches of cash can be given to millennium projects that will open in 2001. The commission's life, originally five years, is to be extended to administer the payment of the last sums of cash. The commission is getting an extra \u00a321m in lottery money to add to \u00a335m already earmarked to bolster 14 science projects funded by the lottery.

      "body": "<p>The easy thing to say is that all is well. Baritone America sends out oak-smoked voices of reassurance. Embassies tell us the system has emerged triumphant. The result will hold, the people will support it, the country will unite, democracy is secured. The US, we're told, is bigger that any of the puzzles that could not be resolved in the last five weeks. Now the definitive answer is declared. There's no meltdown in the markets, no army in the streets. Election 2000 was just a blip on history's screen.</p> <p>I'm afraid this is not true. The election has been a calamity without precedent. Its result is unacceptable, will not be accepted by large numbers of Americans. What they see before them is the brute fact of several thousand uncounted votes that would have made a difference. That's a detail everyone can understand. Beyond the legal argument, the twists and turns of what might or might not be constitutional, the prohibition on counting all the votes has an elemental simplicity. Nobody will forget it. Democracy, quite simply, was poisoned to put George W Bush in the White House.</p> <p>So were most of the institutions this election touched: presidency, federal court, state court, state officialdom, election invigilators, the very mechanism of balloting itself. The US Congress, it might be said, was an exception. Its elections were decided fair and square. But it is in the divided theatre of the Congress that the bitterness to which this flawed process has given rise will now, with untamed ferocity, be played out.</p> <p>One institution is damaged worse than any other. The circumstances of Bush's election may make him weak for four years, but they will corrupt the reputation of the US supreme court, which presided over their working-out, far beyond that. At the moment when the country needed the timeless, almost sacred qualities the court alone has habitually supplied, these were withheld at best by perverted legalism, at worst by a partisanship that was as righteous as it was, of course, unadmitted.</p> <p>Previous cases put the court in the same white-hot cauldron of political controversy, and did not find it wanting. Over both the Pentagon Papers and Watergate, presidents had everything at stake, but the court's intervention was not seen as political. Its reputation wasn't threatened but enhanced. In those days, the political provenance of the justices was seldom an issue, because enough of them quickly established a pattern of judicial behaviour at odds with what their presidential appointers expected. They rose above their origins. They became demonstrably dispassionate. They did judicial not political things. Public trust in them deepened.</p> <p>The case of Gore v Bush has ruined this trust, as some of Tuesday night's judgments regretfully acknowledged. Taking the case in the first place was a political act, transgressing the court's historic restraints against interfering in state elections. It came peculiarly from a rightwing court, whose thrust under Chief Justice Rehnquist has been in favour of states' rights on all matters. Such a deviation from their norm showed that politics had well and truly triumphed over intellect.</p> <p>The process continued right to the end, with the final judgment of the majority in the 5-4 split. The effect was best depicted by the other side. The majority strained every intellectual muscle to smash the credibility of the Florida supreme court, which had said that counting votes was what mattered and had ordered it to be resumed. By endorsing Mr Bush's attack on the impartiality of the Florida judges, Justice Stevens said, \"the majority of this court can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of judges throughout this land\". There might be no clear winner of the election, he added, but the identity of the loser was clear: \"It is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.\"</p> <p>For this terrible verdict, the Bush campaign is substantially responsible. The Gore people were not blameless. They stopped at nothing in the titanic political struggle. But Bush, who had assailed Gore's use of the courts, then deployed them himself every time it looked as though the votes might start to be fully counted. His entire purpose was to ensure that a proper count, rectifying the defects of the machines, did not take place. That's the legacy he's stuck with. It will be perhaps the only merit in the victory of this strangely unformed, inadequate man. He must now somehow make sense of the anti-democratic whirlwind which he was mainly responsible for sowing. His partisanship, rather than the other guy's, now faces the challenge of converting itself into leadership of the nation.</p> <p>An irony lies behind this. Partisanship in America has never, in recent decades, been more destructive than it has now become. The two parties' activists view each other with hostility. Yet the issues that split them are quite narrow. There's no broad pervasive difference over the economic or social principles by which America should be run. Every Republican and Democrat is a full-blooded capitalist. They may typically disagree about guns and abortion and, to some extent, about tax. But Bush and Gore spent the campaign not emphasising these differences, with the exception of tax, but burying them, in attempts to appeal to the swinging voters whose very elusiveness consists in the fact that they are not partisan at all.</p> <p>The partisanship, in other words, is essentially personal. It is about tribe, power and possession, not about ideas. It sits on top of a country that does not disagree about very much, but has just exhibited an unfortunate capacity for dividing its vote precisely down the middle - a reflection not of how different the parties are, but how little there is to choose between them.</p> <p>This ought to be material a new president could work with. The nation is not profoundly at odds with itself. Though there's a rough geographical divide between one faction and another, the heart of America contains the stuff of compromise - more so than Britain or continental Europe, with their ideological parties. But the American system, and its political class on both sides, are the enemies of that. Neither the system nor the class serves the people well. For all his bitter denunciations of Washington, Mr Bush will be a president who got there as the product of that system and the creature of that class. The public's trust that he truly represents them will be almost impossible to muster.</p> <p>The strength of the court used to be that, when all else failed, such trust continued to repose there at least. But when Bush embarks on his task, a bastion of the American system will be missing. Its purity has been dismantled, at his command and with the connivance of five justices who let judgment surrender to politics. Justice Stevens said hopefully that \"time will one day heal the wound\". The trouble is that the inflicting of it has drawn blood that's only now beginning to flow. One of Bush's first ambitions may be to enlarge the majority that put him where he is. He's often said he wants more conservatives on the court.

      "body": "<p>A key project to put computers into every classroom in Northern Ireland collapsed yesterday - and wiped \u00a345m off the value of educational software group RM. </p> <p>Its shares tumbled 47.5p to 520p - half the price they were changing hands at in the summer - valuing the company at \u00a3485m. </p> <p>The trouble has been caused by Classroom 2000, a \u00a3300m, 10-year joint venture project with Fujitsu's ICL unit - and financed under the government's private finance initiative - to put managed computer services into all schools in Northern Ireland. The deal would have been worth \u00a315m a year to RM. </p> <p>The problems with the PFI negotiations were first flagged by RM back in September when the firm warned the project was facing delays and announced it was making a provision of \u00a35.5m to cover the costs associated with the project. But the talks have foundered. </p> <p>\"We have invested considerable effort to design an exciting an innovative ICT solution for schools in Northern Ireland, so it is of course disappointing to finally report that we have been unable to agree on commercial terms,\" said chief executive Richard Girling. </p> <p>At the time of its annual results in November, when RM turned in a profit of \u00a315.5m, the company said the project had cost \u00a35.4m and warned its shareholders not to expect any income from the contract for the foreseeable future. Spending on the project has now been slashed to be accommodated within normal sales and marketing revenue and yesterday the company confirmed it would not be making any money from Classroom 2000 this year. </p> <p>RM is training 100,000 teachers how to use technology and manages 20,000 desktops in schools. Some 250,000 students use RM software. </p> <p>House broker Warburg said the Classroom 2000 problems were factored into the price and it did not intend to change its \u00a317m profit forecast for the year to 2001. The shares are a \"hold\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "A key project to put computers into every classroom in Northern Ireland collapsed yesterday - and wiped \u00a345m off the value of educational software group RM. Its shares tumbled 47.5p to 520p - half the price they were changing hands at in the summer - valuing the company at \u00a3485m. The trouble has been caused by Classroom 2000, a \u00a3300m, 10-year joint venture project with Fujitsu's ICL unit - and financed under the government's private finance initiative - to put managed computer services into all schools in Northern Ireland. The deal would have been worth \u00a315m a year to RM. The problems with the PFI negotiations were first flagged by RM back in September when the firm warned the project was facing delays and announced it was making a provision of \u00a35.5m to cover the costs associated with the project. But the talks have foundered. \"We have invested considerable effort to design an exciting an innovative ICT solution for schools in Northern Ireland, so it is of course disappointing to finally report that we have been unable to agree on commercial terms,\" said chief executive Richard Girling. At the time of its annual results in November, when RM turned in a profit of \u00a315.5m, the company said the project had cost \u00a35.4m and warned its shareholders not to expect any income from the contract for the foreseeable future. Spending on the project has now been slashed to be accommodated within normal sales and marketing revenue and yesterday the company confirmed it would not be making any money from Classroom 2000 this year. RM is training 100,000 teachers how to use technology and manages 20,000 desktops in schools. Some 250,000 students use RM software. House broker Warburg said the Classroom 2000 problems were factored into the price and it did not intend to change its \u00a317m profit forecast for the year to 2001. The shares are a \"hold\".",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It would be wrong to pretend that I was not pleased to join the privy council. In truth I was delighted. After \"shadowing\" Margaret Thatcher for three years, I had hoped to replace her at the Department of Education. But Harold Wilson, offended by a speech in which I had attacked the public schools, exiled me to the Foreign Office to do penance as minister of state. The official letter, telling me that the Queen was \"minded\" to make me Right Honourable, was, I thought, proof that the prime minister had forgiven me.</p> <p>I was wrong. Joining the privy council did, however, improve my formal status. As soon as I promised to defend the Queen against \"all foreign princes, persons, prelates, states or potentates\" I became Right Honourable for life. From then on every postman knew that I was (or had been) a big noise in Whitehall and Westminster. And that is the privy council's principal purpose. Membership is a medal. Old politicians wear the distinction as if it were part campaign ribbon and part wound stripe.</p> <p>Traditionalists and romantics still pretend that the privy council is more than a footnote to the \"dignified\" - that is to say outdated - part of our constitution. Harold Wilson once assured Richard Nixon that, because he was addressing ministers who had taken the privy council oath, he could speak freely about nuclear strategy. No doubt the secrets of the Pentagon remained secure. But I doubt if it was the promise \"not (to) know or understand of any manner of thing to be attempted, done, or spoken against Her Majesty's person, honour, crown, or dignity royal\" which prevented the president's audience from running out of Downing Street to phone the Soviet embassy.</p> <p>Quoting those words from the privy council's oath is certainly an offence and possibly treason. Members are required to \"keep secret all matters committed and revealed unto you or that shall be treated secretly in council\". So I should not describe the Gilbertian meeting at which I promised to \"defend all jurisdictions, pre-eminences and authorities granted to Her Majesty\".</p> <p>I can, however, reveal that, during the rehearsal which preceded the main event, the secretary to the council felt it necessary to explain why he was anxious about what was to follow. Wallace Rawling, prime minister of New Zealand, had been made Right Honourable in absentia. He would therefore be \"sworn\" separately. The Queen did not like the privy council to drag on.</p> <p>Joel Barnett (chief secretary to the Treasury) then explained that he wished to swear his oath of allegiance on an Old Testament. Brian O'Malley (minister of state at the Department of Social Services) added that he must have a Douay Bible. Shamed by their bravery into confessing my own heresy, I exercised the dissenter's right to affirm. That left a judge to perform the usual ritual in the first of five separate ceremonies.</p> <p>The Queen remained calm. But, as we left the audience chamber, Jim Callaghan, one of the old hands who had been on duty that day, led me towards an archbishop (I think he was York) who was about to do what is required of archbishops before they assume their archdioceses. Putting an avuncular arm round my shoulder, Jim enquired \"Have you met Roy Hattersley? Her Majesty had to keep you waiting because he wouldn't swear on the Bible\".</p> <p>In the 25 years since that fateful day, I have attended only one privy council meeting. Like most cabinet ministers I was reluctant to waste my time - though at least (unlike some of my colleagues) I was never required to travel to Balmoral for a pointless ceremony which is, at best, a convenient legal fiction built round the senior ministers, judges and archbishops who become Right Honourable as a matter of course.</p> <p>At worst the privy council is neither an instrument of baronial tyranny nor the last bastion of monarchist power. It is simply pointless. The usual complaint against it (normally made by Tony Benn) is that it is the institution through which orders in council are made and the royal prerogative exercised - both potential abuses of our parliamentary system. But the blame lies with ministers. The privy council only provides the flummery which camouflages their autocracy.</p> <p>Orders in council are often no more than the mechanism which activates secondary legislation - clauses of an act of parliament which come into force when the orders are made. The real danger to democracy is the royal prerogative. It began life as the instrument by which the monarch overruled Lords and Commons. But after the sovereignty of parliament was established, ministers, acting in the monarch's name, used the prerogative to legitimise decisions which they took without parliamentary approval.</p> <p>Ten years ago, a progressive chief constable - who did not wish to change the character of his police force by equipping it with CS gas - was warned that, unless he \"voluntarily\" accepted the Home Office's instruction, the policy would be imposed on him \"under the royal prerogative\". There was even some talk of John Major using the device to ratify the Maastricht Treaty if the House of Commons would not pass the necessary resolution.</p> <p>No government could have survived so gigantic an affront to parliamentary government. But the royal prerogative is still used to legitimise smaller acts of autocracy. In other democracies, appointments to the cabinet are ratified (or not) by the legislature and dates of elections are decided by statute. In Britain, ministers take office and parliament is dissolved under the royal prerogative. Do not blame \"the Queen in council\". Power lies with politicians. So does the opportunity for power's abuse.</p> <p>That does not mean that its judicial committee - which meets from time to time to consider cases of especial constitutional significance - is either powerless or pointless. But, like the House of Lords \"acting in its judicial capacity\", it is just a fancy name for a collection of senior judges. The aura of the privy council is attached to both institutions because of two peculiarly English diseases - the belief that association with the sovereign reinforces authority and the conviction that antiquity increases respect.</p> <p>So the privy council is not just an anachronism. It is one of those elements in our constitution which, because they have arcane rules and archaic associations, exist to prove that real power lies in places remote from everyday life. The mystery and magic of the monarchy and everything which flows from it are meant to be living proof of the distinction between them and us. The privy council is part of the deferential society. A genuinely radical government - anxious to promote the idea either of equality or meritocracy - would politely suggest to the Queen that she confirmed her desire to modernise the monarchy by announcing that she no longer needed \"privy\" advisers.</p> <p>Yet most meetings of the privy council, although shrouded in secrecy, are concerned only with trivia. The one item of business which I recall was \"to appoint the chaplain of Wadham College, Oxford\", a duty to which the Queen reasonably reacted by asking \"Why do I do this?\" Michael Foot, lord president of the privy council, was ready with an explanation. \"Wadham,\" he began, \"was my college\".</p> <p>There followed a fascinating account of Oxford history from medieval times. We had just arrived at the Reformation when the Queen - with brilliant timing and perfect courtesy - thanked him and declared the privy council over. That is exactly the right attitude towards the whole unnecessary business.</p> <p><b>Those Right Honourables</b></p> <p>There are currently just over 500 members of the privy council, including all senior members of past and present governments. This \"magic circle\", with regency offices in Carlton Gardens near Buckingham Palace, has a staff of two dozen officials, mostly dealing with miscellaneous appeals and university matters.

      "bodyText": "It would be wrong to pretend that I was not pleased to join the privy council. In truth I was delighted. After \"shadowing\" Margaret Thatcher for three years, I had hoped to replace her at the Department of Education. But Harold Wilson, offended by a speech in which I had attacked the public schools, exiled me to the Foreign Office to do penance as minister of state. The official letter, telling me that the Queen was \"minded\" to make me Right Honourable, was, I thought, proof that the prime minister had forgiven me. I was wrong. Joining the privy council did, however, improve my formal status. As soon as I promised to defend the Queen against \"all foreign princes, persons, prelates, states or potentates\" I became Right Honourable for life. From then on every postman knew that I was (or had been) a big noise in Whitehall and Westminster. And that is the privy council's principal purpose. Membership is a medal. Old politicians wear the distinction as if it were part campaign ribbon and part wound stripe. Traditionalists and romantics still pretend that the privy council is more than a footnote to the \"dignified\" - that is to say outdated - part of our constitution. Harold Wilson once assured Richard Nixon that, because he was addressing ministers who had taken the privy council oath, he could speak freely about nuclear strategy. No doubt the secrets of the Pentagon remained secure. But I doubt if it was the promise \"not (to) know or understand of any manner of thing to be attempted, done, or spoken against Her Majesty's person, honour, crown, or dignity royal\" which prevented the president's audience from running out of Downing Street to phone the Soviet embassy. Quoting those words from the privy council's oath is certainly an offence and possibly treason. Members are required to \"keep secret all matters committed and revealed unto you or that shall be treated secretly in council\". So I should not describe the Gilbertian meeting at which I promised to \"defend all jurisdictions, pre-eminences and authorities granted to Her Majesty\". I can, however, reveal that, during the rehearsal which preceded the main event, the secretary to the council felt it necessary to explain why he was anxious about what was to follow. Wallace Rawling, prime minister of New Zealand, had been made Right Honourable in absentia. He would therefore be \"sworn\" separately. The Queen did not like the privy council to drag on. Joel Barnett (chief secretary to the Treasury) then explained that he wished to swear his oath of allegiance on an Old Testament. Brian O'Malley (minister of state at the Department of Social Services) added that he must have a Douay Bible. Shamed by their bravery into confessing my own heresy, I exercised the dissenter's right to affirm. That left a judge to perform the usual ritual in the first of five separate ceremonies. The Queen remained calm. But, as we left the audience chamber, Jim Callaghan, one of the old hands who had been on duty that day, led me towards an archbishop (I think he was York) who was about to do what is required of archbishops before they assume their archdioceses. Putting an avuncular arm round my shoulder, Jim enquired \"Have you met Roy Hattersley? Her Majesty had to keep you waiting because he wouldn't swear on the Bible\". In the 25 years since that fateful day, I have attended only one privy council meeting. Like most cabinet ministers I was reluctant to waste my time - though at least (unlike some of my colleagues) I was never required to travel to Balmoral for a pointless ceremony which is, at best, a convenient legal fiction built round the senior ministers, judges and archbishops who become Right Honourable as a matter of course. At worst the privy council is neither an instrument of baronial tyranny nor the last bastion of monarchist power. It is simply pointless. The usual complaint against it (normally made by Tony Benn) is that it is the institution through which orders in council are made and the royal prerogative exercised - both potential abuses of our parliamentary system. But the blame lies with ministers. The privy council only provides the flummery which camouflages their autocracy. Orders in council are often no more than the mechanism which activates secondary legislation - clauses of an act of parliament which come into force when the orders are made. The real danger to democracy is the royal prerogative. It began life as the instrument by which the monarch overruled Lords and Commons. But after the sovereignty of parliament was established, ministers, acting in the monarch's name, used the prerogative to legitimise decisions which they took without parliamentary approval. Ten years ago, a progressive chief constable - who did not wish to change the character of his police force by equipping it with CS gas - was warned that, unless he \"voluntarily\" accepted the Home Office's instruction, the policy would be imposed on him \"under the royal prerogative\". There was even some talk of John Major using the device to ratify the Maastricht Treaty if the House of Commons would not pass the necessary resolution. No government could have survived so gigantic an affront to parliamentary government. But the royal prerogative is still used to legitimise smaller acts of autocracy. In other democracies, appointments to the cabinet are ratified (or not) by the legislature and dates of elections are decided by statute. In Britain, ministers take office and parliament is dissolved under the royal prerogative. Do not blame \"the Queen in council\". Power lies with politicians. So does the opportunity for power's abuse. That does not mean that its judicial committee - which meets from time to time to consider cases of especial constitutional significance - is either powerless or pointless. But, like the House of Lords \"acting in its judicial capacity\", it is just a fancy name for a collection of senior judges. The aura of the privy council is attached to both institutions because of two peculiarly English diseases - the belief that association with the sovereign reinforces authority and the conviction that antiquity increases respect. So the privy council is not just an anachronism. It is one of those elements in our constitution which, because they have arcane rules and archaic associations, exist to prove that real power lies in places remote from everyday life. The mystery and magic of the monarchy and everything which flows from it are meant to be living proof of the distinction between them and us. The privy council is part of the deferential society. A genuinely radical government - anxious to promote the idea either of equality or meritocracy - would politely suggest to the Queen that she confirmed her desire to modernise the monarchy by announcing that she no longer needed \"privy\" advisers. Yet most meetings of the privy council, although shrouded in secrecy, are concerned only with trivia. The one item of business which I recall was \"to appoint the chaplain of Wadham College, Oxford\", a duty to which the Queen reasonably reacted by asking \"Why do I do this?\" Michael Foot, lord president of the privy council, was ready with an explanation. \"Wadham,\" he began, \"was my college\". There followed a fascinating account of Oxford history from medieval times. We had just arrived at the Reformation when the Queen - with brilliant timing and perfect courtesy - thanked him and declared the privy council over. That is exactly the right attitude towards the whole unnecessary business. Those Right Honourables There are currently just over 500 members of the privy council, including all senior members of past and present governments. This \"magic circle\", with regency offices in Carlton Gardens near Buckingham Palace, has a staff of two dozen officials, mostly dealing with miscellaneous appeals and university matters. The Labour government's leader of the house, Margaret Beckett, has the job of organising regular meetings of privy councillors with the Queen.

Railtrack's move was seen in the industry as an attempt by the company to buy off its strongest critic. The PO has voiced concerns over Railtrack's decision to commandeer part of the west coast main line over Christmas and its severe restrictions on speed limits. These have imposed heavy delays on PO rail deliveries. The possible appointment of Mr Williams was also seen as a way for Railtrack to head off legal action by the Post Office for loss of business, now running to millions of pounds. The hiatus over the strengthening of the board is partly seen as a move by Railtrack to protect itself from charges of incompetence or even corporate manslaughter by outside groups. The arrival of Mr Williams, it is argued, woulld make it difficult for the Post Office to seek compensation against Railtrack. Changes at senior level at Railtrack have not been achieved smoothly. Richard Middleton, the company's most senior executive, threatened to resign if his position was usurped by a new man from Yorkshire Water, appointed to head Railtrack's operations. Sir Philip Beck, Railtrack's chairman, is looking for an energetic replacement from next July. Several captains of industry and a number of leading politicians, including Kenneth Clarke, Michael Heseltine and Steven Norris, have all been mentioned for the job. The company is desperately looking for a well known businessman or politician who can take the heat off Railtrack's chief executive during a crisis to allow him to get on with the job of running the company.",

The bill passed 67-35 on first reading, but must go through three more votes before it becomes law and opens the way for the former Likud party boss to challenge Ehud Barak, the current Labour party prime minister. The knesset vote followed one of the heaviest gunbattles of the past 11 weeks in Gaza, which left four Palestinian policemen dead and dealt another blow to Mr Barak's aspirations of concluding a peace deal before the elections. The policemen were killed by Israeli forces near the Khan Younis refugee camp in an exchange of gunfire that raged for hours. Yesterday's hostilities began when Palestinians opened fire on Israeli troops at around 1am. The soldiers returned fire, according to the Israeli army. Palestinians, however, alleged that the fighting began when an Israeli bulldozer tried to remove a sand embankment erected by Palestinians to protect civilians from what they said had been regular Israeli shooting. Major Yarden Vitikay, the Israeli army spokesman, said the Palestinians had built the embankment to provide cover as they shot at Israelis. The army decided to destroy it after gunmen fired into a classroom at the nearby Neve Dekalim Jewish settlement on Tuesday. As machine-gun fire and explosions awoke the refugees at Khan Younis, loudspeakers called on residents to confront the Israelis. \"We appeal to every man with a weapon to come to defend his land and honour to drive out the Israeli invasion,\" the loudspeakers urged. Witnesses said up to 1,000 Palestinian gunmen heeded the call. The Palestinian security chief, General Abdel-Razek al-Majaydeh, warned Israel that any of its soldiers trying to raid Palestinian areas again would not get out alive. Visiting the camp's hospital, the Palestinian minister of health, Dr Riad Za'anoun, said 33 people, including three children, had been wounded. He said the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, had \"been informed of the ugly attack on the people in Khan Younis\". In the West Bank city of Hebron, a Palestinian was shot dead in front of his shop by Israeli soldiers. The militant group Hamas said the man was a member of its military wing and called his killing an assassination. Mr Netanyahu's return to political office, after resigning his seat last year, has been impeded by a law which says that only members of parliament can stand in February's election. A beleaguered Mr Barak, who was elected last year on a agenda of peace, resigned last Sunday. The newly proposed law would allow any citizen to run for the prime minister's position in a special election.

      "body": "<p>'We are a grandmother,\" Margaret Thatcher once famously said. In fact, one in three adults is - or are, if you prefer - a grandparent. Despite the fact that many women now postpone having their first child until they are 30, the average age to become a grandparent is still just 50. Most of these maintain regular contact with their grandchildren: as today's Guardian poll shows, well over a third of Britain's grandparents put in the equivalent of a three-day week looking after grandchildren. It seems only proper, then, that 40% of parents admit that their working lives would be impossible without the childcare provided by their parents.</p> <p>Demographic change is fuelling the rise of grandparents as a social force: people are living longer, they are more affluent in middle age and retirement, and they lead more active lives. While much has been said about children getting old younger, there is a counterphenomenon of pensioners getting young older. My parents' generation - children of the 30s and 40s - were lucky if they had both parents, let alone one or two grandparents. Half a century of medical advances - and no major wars - mean that for my children's generation, children of the 90s, it is common to have three or even four grandparents.</p> <p>Because nearly half of marriages end in divorce and single parents now represent a quarter of families with children, grandparents are being dragooned into helping with the grandkids as never before - as mother's helpers, cost-free childminders, even surrogate parents. As Shirley Lowe's article attests, nearly half of the childcare in this country is provided by grandparents - a vast iceberg of domestic labour that is unpaid, unseen and largely unrecognised. Grandparenting is required to be its own reward. Freely given, in every sense, this time may be, but it also brings its pressures and resentments: a recent poll found that four out of 10 grandparents wished for a life with fewer family responsibilities.</p> <p>The sociologist Michael Young, who with Peter Willmott wrote a seminal study of family and kinship in London's east end in the 1950s, has observed the emergence of a new type of extended family. The 21st-century family is not extended laterally - as those 50s working-class families were, with many members of the same generation living in close proximity - but vertically. The ties that bind now leapfrog generations, from grandparent to grandchild.</p> <p>And those ties are very real. For grandparents, the experience is one to savour: now there is time to enjoy the children of their children. For many, it may even seem like a second chance at parenting. For parents, too, presenting their mother and father with grandchildren is a deeply felt rite of passage, a sign that they have assumed the mantle of adult responsibility. Grandchildren provide a new focus for family relationships, rekindling a kind of intimacy that is exciting and gratifying to all. Grandparenting offers the chance to reunite generations separated by a gulf of cultural experience.</p> <p>The cultural affiliations of different generations are as significant a factor behind the new grandparents as demographic shifts: grandparenting has become important because the baby boomers are doing it. That peculiarly self-conscious and contentious generation that came of age in the 1960s, which grew up with pop, protest and the pill, put off having children longer than their parents had while they enjoyed an extended adolescence. But history and human evolution have caught up with them willy-nilly. Think about it: Mick Jagger is a grandad, for God's sake! No wonder we're getting interested in this inter-generational business. Grandparenting is groovy, man.</p> <p>This year saw Britain's first grandparenting conference, yet its organiser, the Family Policy Studies Centre, acknowledges that the study of grandparenting is still (improbable phrase) in its infancy. Policy-makers, certainly, are behind the curve. Last week the government published a green paper which should eventually bring the UK more or less in line with other European countries on the provision of leave for working parents. But the Asda supermarket chain is a step ahead, recently introducing a seven-day \"grandparents' leave\" allowance and enabling staff to opt for further unpaid leave of up to three months after the birth of a grandchild.</p> <p>Whether as the object of public policy or the subject of their own experience, grandparents have become a social force to be reckoned with. The Guardian has always tried to recognise when the emerging forms of social and cultural change have reached critical mass - and to give them a voice. In the 1960s, on its women's pages, it became the first national newspaper to seriously engage with feminism. In 1992, it launched its parents pages to tackle growing concerns with the balance between work and children. Now it is time for grandparents to have a space of their own.</p> <p>This is why every month the Guardian will now be publishing a grandparents page in G2. Parents constantly wax lyrical about the pleasures and pains of parenthood. Yet we rarely pause to reflect that our experience might not be unique (or uniquely interesting). If we stop to listen, our own parents might still have something to teach us.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'We are a grandmother,\" Margaret Thatcher once famously said. In fact, one in three adults is - or are, if you prefer - a grandparent. Despite the fact that many women now postpone having their first child until they are 30, the average age to become a grandparent is still just 50. Most of these maintain regular contact with their grandchildren: as today's Guardian poll shows, well over a third of Britain's grandparents put in the equivalent of a three-day week looking after grandchildren. It seems only proper, then, that 40% of parents admit that their working lives would be impossible without the childcare provided by their parents. Demographic change is fuelling the rise of grandparents as a social force: people are living longer, they are more affluent in middle age and retirement, and they lead more active lives. While much has been said about children getting old younger, there is a counterphenomenon of pensioners getting young older. My parents' generation - children of the 30s and 40s - were lucky if they had both parents, let alone one or two grandparents. Half a century of medical advances - and no major wars - mean that for my children's generation, children of the 90s, it is common to have three or even four grandparents. Because nearly half of marriages end in divorce and single parents now represent a quarter of families with children, grandparents are being dragooned into helping with the grandkids as never before - as mother's helpers, cost-free childminders, even surrogate parents. As Shirley Lowe's article attests, nearly half of the childcare in this country is provided by grandparents - a vast iceberg of domestic labour that is unpaid, unseen and largely unrecognised. Grandparenting is required to be its own reward. Freely given, in every sense, this time may be, but it also brings its pressures and resentments: a recent poll found that four out of 10 grandparents wished for a life with fewer family responsibilities. The sociologist Michael Young, who with Peter Willmott wrote a seminal study of family and kinship in London's east end in the 1950s, has observed the emergence of a new type of extended family. The 21st-century family is not extended laterally - as those 50s working-class families were, with many members of the same generation living in close proximity - but vertically. The ties that bind now leapfrog generations, from grandparent to grandchild. And those ties are very real. For grandparents, the experience is one to savour: now there is time to enjoy the children of their children. For many, it may even seem like a second chance at parenting. For parents, too, presenting their mother and father with grandchildren is a deeply felt rite of passage, a sign that they have assumed the mantle of adult responsibility. Grandchildren provide a new focus for family relationships, rekindling a kind of intimacy that is exciting and gratifying to all. Grandparenting offers the chance to reunite generations separated by a gulf of cultural experience. The cultural affiliations of different generations are as significant a factor behind the new grandparents as demographic shifts: grandparenting has become important because the baby boomers are doing it. That peculiarly self-conscious and contentious generation that came of age in the 1960s, which grew up with pop, protest and the pill, put off having children longer than their parents had while they enjoyed an extended adolescence. But history and human evolution have caught up with them willy-nilly. Think about it: Mick Jagger is a grandad, for God's sake! No wonder we're getting interested in this inter-generational business. Grandparenting is groovy, man. This year saw Britain's first grandparenting conference, yet its organiser, the Family Policy Studies Centre, acknowledges that the study of grandparenting is still (improbable phrase) in its infancy. Policy-makers, certainly, are behind the curve. Last week the government published a green paper which should eventually bring the UK more or less in line with other European countries on the provision of leave for working parents. But the Asda supermarket chain is a step ahead, recently introducing a seven-day \"grandparents' leave\" allowance and enabling staff to opt for further unpaid leave of up to three months after the birth of a grandchild. Whether as the object of public policy or the subject of their own experience, grandparents have become a social force to be reckoned with. The Guardian has always tried to recognise when the emerging forms of social and cultural change have reached critical mass - and to give them a voice. In the 1960s, on its women's pages, it became the first national newspaper to seriously engage with feminism. In 1992, it launched its parents pages to tackle growing concerns with the balance between work and children. Now it is time for grandparents to have a space of their own. This is why every month the Guardian will now be publishing a grandparents page in G2. Parents constantly wax lyrical about the pleasures and pains of parenthood. Yet we rarely pause to reflect that our experience might not be unique (or uniquely interesting). If we stop to listen, our own parents might still have something to teach us.",

It is a family member, close to kale, cabbages, calabrese, broccoli, kohlrabi, Brussels sprout and cauliflower, which in turn are all one species. These are all descended from some cliff-dwelling, kale-like progenitors from the Mediterranean region, and then honed into astonishingly different varieties by centuries of selection and cross-breeding. Together, these plants were worth probably \u00a3200m to the UK; one other brassica, oilseed rape, is worth more than \u00a3400m to the UK economy. They will all soon be indebted to the knowledge won from their tiny cousin. </p> <p>\"Things which affect growth of crops, their post-harvest ability to survive on the shelves or be resistant to disease, can be studied in detail in arabidopsis and we are now applying that in brassicas,\" says Graham King of the HRI. \"Brassicas have larger chromosomes, more DNA and longer life cycles, so that's why they haven't been used as a model system.

A source at the UN in New York said yesterday that a resolution proposed in the summer by the secretary-general, Kofi Annan, to raise the number of UN peace-keepers in Sierra Leone from 13,000 to 20,000 has had to be \"put on a backburner\". Western diplomats are sceptical that the current ceasefire in Sierra Leone will hold in the next few weeks as UN forces attempt to move into areas controlled by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to monitor the ceasefire. Mr Annan is said to be disappointed at the lack of countries, especially western nations, willing to commit troops. A UN official said: \"It is reminiscent of other African peace-keeping operations, not least Rwanda, when we were begging countries for troops and no one was forthcoming.\" He added that many developing countries were unhappy at contributing troops because the US and Europeans were holding back: \"Western countries [in the UN security council] are making decisions about sending in troops and expecting developing countries to provide troops.\" He exempted Britain, whose contribution in Sierra Leone he described as faultless.

The UN asked the Indians, who had been involved in a row with Nigerian troops, to stay but they agreed to only one concession, to phase their withdrawal. Ukraine has promised to send a specialist unit and talks are also taking place with Pakistan and Nepal. The transition represents a vulnerable time for peace-keepers but the UN says it has no intelligence that the RUF might want to exploit this by mounting an offensive. The prime minister, Tony Blair, who also asked the Indians to stay, phoned European Union partners asking them to contribute troops but to no avail. Approaches have also been made to Turkey. A Foreign Office spokesman played down the issue, saying that some other European countries who might have contributed had already promised troops to a peace-keeping force for the Eritrean-Ethiopian border. The spokesman said force numbers were not the issue: \"Focusing on a finite number of troops is pointless unless they have been properly trained and have a proper command structure. That is much more important than actual numbers.\" He added that Nigerian troops, currently being trained by US forces, were also due to go to Sierra Leone and would take the numbers beyond 13,000. Although a ceasefire is holding, the RUF is unlikely to give up the key diamond-producing areas. Most of the diamonds end up in neighbouring Liberia, whose president, Charles Taylor, has been accused of supporting the rebels. A UN panel set up to look at diamonds in Sierra Leone is due to publish its findings tomorrow and is set to criticise the part played by Mr Taylor. The UN is then likely to apply \"smart\" sanctions, such as refusing visa applications by Mr Taylor and his inner-circle and putting a ban on diamonds from Liberia. The UN needs a success in Sierra Leone. Without one, the UN will find it even harder to gather forces for the more complex conflict in the Congo.",

      "body": "<p>Basic science more than pays for itself through its technological spin-offs, right? Most politicians seem to take a lot of convincing. So let us switch off our PCs and let the politicians see what life is like without the information revolution, which is based on a fundamental idea revealed exactly 100 years ago today - quantum theory. The first quantum theory emerged from the brain of a leading German theorist, Max Planck.</p> <p> He was working with a group of government-funded experimenters investigating a subject so laughably abstruse that most people would be amazed it could be of any interest to anyone outside academia. On December 14, 1900, the 42-year-old Max Planck stood before his colleagues at the German Physical Society in Berlin to report on a new piece of work. He was laying the foundation stone in quantum theory, which eventually taught us that nature at the sub-microscopic level is granular, not smooth. As every physics student learns today, the energy of an atom jiggling around in a solid is quantised - its values are discrete, they don't vary smoothly as we might expect from looking at energy on the everyday scale. But all that would have been news to Planck a century ago. </p> <p>His first quantum theory was a brilliantly cobbled together lash-up, designed to make theory fit data taken by his experimenter colleagues. He wanted to derive, from first principles, a formula for the comparative brightness of each colour in the electromagnetic spectrum from a tiny hole in a special oven at a range of steady temperatures. </p> <p>Planck found that the only way he could explain the data was to savage some orthodox theoretical ideas. He had to assume that the total energy of all the atoms in the wall of the atoms, at each frequency of vibration, came in discrete lumps, or \"quanta\". </p> <p>Planck was a deeply conservative thinker. He introduced the quantum idea unwillingly and against his instinct to stick with proven theoretical ideas. He later said: \"I did not give it much thought except for this: that I had to obtain a positive result, under any circumstances and at whatever cost.\" </p> <p>True to this indifference, he scarcely published anything else on the quantum for the next four-and-a-half years. But during that time he tried hard to use pre-quantum ideas to understand a new quantity (now called Planck's constant h ) that he had introduced as part of his new theory. He failed because h was a truly fundamental constant, not derivable from another theory - the only such constant to be introduced in the entire 20th century. It now features in almost every equation of quantum theory. </p> <p>Planck loathed the very idea of an uprising against the classical scientific ideas about energy that he cherished. The true beginner of the quantum revolution was Albert Einstein, who read of Planck's quantum idea and studied it while he was working in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905, Einstein wrote a paper that gave the great Planck a physics lesson, correcting a serious error in his early quantum derivation, and putting forward the idea that the energy of light, and all other radiation, comes in quanta. Planck was a huge admirer of Einstein, whom he dubbed \"the new Copernicus\", but he abominated Einstein's idea of radiation quanta and went to his grave in 1947 unconvinced. </p> <p>By the late 1920s, other physicists had come up with a fully fledged quantum theory of the atom. Quantum theory has since formed the basis of our understanding of the micro-world, enabling technologists to develop increasingly effective transistors, microprocessors, lasers and fibre-optic cables. The highlight of the theory's technological applications occurred in 1947, when a group of physicists (including the quantum theorist John Bardeen) invented the transistor, one of the components of microprocessors, which power every PC. </p> <p>But the theorists could never have begun the revolution without experimenters. They, in turn, would not have been able to take their results without state-of-the-art facilities in their institution, the Imperial Institute of Physics and Technology. Founded by the German government and the wealthy industrialist, Werner von Siemens, the institution later became the model for the UK's National Physical Laboratory. </p> <p>The institute was set up to preserve German's industrial pre-eminence. The experiments that Planck's friends were doing were designed to help the German heating and gas-lighting industries understand how lights radiate heat, and so how to make these devices more efficient. It turned out to be the perfect technology foresight project. But, as usual, the relationship between the foreseen benefits and the pay-off was tenuous. </p> <p>So would you consider switching off your PC to con template the impact of fundamental research? I thought not. But next time your machine goes down and you are cursing, spare a thought for today's underfunded quark and string theorists, Planck's successors. What might be the spin-offs of their research in the year 2100? </p> <p> \u0095 Graham Farmelo is head of science communication at the Science Museum. He is editor of a collection of essays, It Must Be Beautiful, published next year by Granta.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Basic science more than pays for itself through its technological spin-offs, right? Most politicians seem to take a lot of convincing. So let us switch off our PCs and let the politicians see what life is like without the information revolution, which is based on a fundamental idea revealed exactly 100 years ago today - quantum theory. The first quantum theory emerged from the brain of a leading German theorist, Max Planck. He was working with a group of government-funded experimenters investigating a subject so laughably abstruse that most people would be amazed it could be of any interest to anyone outside academia. On December 14, 1900, the 42-year-old Max Planck stood before his colleagues at the German Physical Society in Berlin to report on a new piece of work. He was laying the foundation stone in quantum theory, which eventually taught us that nature at the sub-microscopic level is granular, not smooth. As every physics student learns today, the energy of an atom jiggling around in a solid is quantised - its values are discrete, they don't vary smoothly as we might expect from looking at energy on the everyday scale. But all that would have been news to Planck a century ago. His first quantum theory was a brilliantly cobbled together lash-up, designed to make theory fit data taken by his experimenter colleagues. He wanted to derive, from first principles, a formula for the comparative brightness of each colour in the electromagnetic spectrum from a tiny hole in a special oven at a range of steady temperatures. Planck found that the only way he could explain the data was to savage some orthodox theoretical ideas. He had to assume that the total energy of all the atoms in the wall of the atoms, at each frequency of vibration, came in discrete lumps, or \"quanta\". Planck was a deeply conservative thinker. He introduced the quantum idea unwillingly and against his instinct to stick with proven theoretical ideas. He later said: \"I did not give it much thought except for this: that I had to obtain a positive result, under any circumstances and at whatever cost.\" True to this indifference, he scarcely published anything else on the quantum for the next four-and-a-half years. But during that time he tried hard to use pre-quantum ideas to understand a new quantity (now called Planck's constant h ) that he had introduced as part of his new theory. He failed because h was a truly fundamental constant, not derivable from another theory - the only such constant to be introduced in the entire 20th century. It now features in almost every equation of quantum theory. Planck loathed the very idea of an uprising against the classical scientific ideas about energy that he cherished. The true beginner of the quantum revolution was Albert Einstein, who read of Planck's quantum idea and studied it while he was working in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905, Einstein wrote a paper that gave the great Planck a physics lesson, correcting a serious error in his early quantum derivation, and putting forward the idea that the energy of light, and all other radiation, comes in quanta. Planck was a huge admirer of Einstein, whom he dubbed \"the new Copernicus\", but he abominated Einstein's idea of radiation quanta and went to his grave in 1947 unconvinced. By the late 1920s, other physicists had come up with a fully fledged quantum theory of the atom. Quantum theory has since formed the basis of our understanding of the micro-world, enabling technologists to develop increasingly effective transistors, microprocessors, lasers and fibre-optic cables. The highlight of the theory's technological applications occurred in 1947, when a group of physicists (including the quantum theorist John Bardeen) invented the transistor, one of the components of microprocessors, which power every PC. But the theorists could never have begun the revolution without experimenters. They, in turn, would not have been able to take their results without state-of-the-art facilities in their institution, the Imperial Institute of Physics and Technology. Founded by the German government and the wealthy industrialist, Werner von Siemens, the institution later became the model for the UK's National Physical Laboratory. The institute was set up to preserve German's industrial pre-eminence. The experiments that Planck's friends were doing were designed to help the German heating and gas-lighting industries understand how lights radiate heat, and so how to make these devices more efficient. It turned out to be the perfect technology foresight project. But, as usual, the relationship between the foreseen benefits and the pay-off was tenuous. So would you consider switching off your PC to con template the impact of fundamental research? I thought not. But next time your machine goes down and you are cursing, spare a thought for today's underfunded quark and string theorists, Planck's successors. What might be the spin-offs of their research in the year 2100? \u0095 Graham Farmelo is head of science communication at the Science Museum.

What if officials in Miami-Dade county had not been so rattled by a Republican near-riot, protesters pounding on the doors of the counting room, that they suspended their effort when only a fifth of the votes had been recounted?</p> <p>And, in the last days, what if Gore's lawyer, David Boies, had done more to convince the supreme court's waverers that December 12 was not an iron deadline - that there was plenty of time to conclude a recount by the real deadline of December 18?</p> <p>What if, what if, what if? These questions may well plague Al Gore, forcing him to sweat through the nights of the next four years, weighing on his heart as he sees Bush - a man he regards as his political and intellectual inferior - swearing the oath of office next month, delivering the state of the union address or generally enjoying a job Gore be lieves rightfully belongs to him. Perhaps these nagging questions will act as a spur, forcing an astonishingly determined man to fight on to the next round: a grudge match against President Bush in 2004. But maybe they will drag him down, torturing him still when the rest of America has moved on.</p> <p>Unless the rest of America does not move on so easily. For these 36 long days have taken their toll on the United States, exposing to the light failings and divisions within the country which the prosperity of the past eight years had done much to conceal. The presidential contest of 2000 became the election that wouldn't die - and the pain it has caused may not fade quickly.</p> <p>First, there will be the bitterness, felt keenest among Democratic partisans but shared, too, by many of the 50m-plus Americans who cast their ballots for Al Gore. A clean knock-out blow on November 7 would have been hard, but they would have lived with it. But what happened in the early hours of yesterday morning does not feel like a fair defeat. \"It was a raw seizure of power,\" said one Clinton administration official, insisting that five Republican-appointed judges had in effect anointed George W Bush to the presidency - by refusing a count of legal votes \"because they feared the result\".</p> <p>Now Republicans will control all three branches of government - White House and both chambers of Congress - for the first time in nearly 50 years. And yet the arguments of the court majority were so weak, so full of holes, that nothing in the final ruling can reassure Democrats that in the end fairness, however harsh, prevailed. They will for ever doubt the legitimacy of the government that rules them.</p> <p>For Gore and his supporters will look back on these five long weeks as a series of Republican attempts - in one court or other - to stop citizens' votes being counted for fear of what they might reveal. Whether it was the constant delays that kept volunteers stewing in the heat of Palm Beach county, stopping them counting when time was already precious, or the endless procedures in assorted courts - county, circuit or supreme, state and federal - it all boiled down to one theme. The Republicans did not want all Florida's votes to be counted, and that has offended American democrats - with both a large and a small D. The talk of a virtual coup d'\u00e9tat will grow.</p> <p>Others less committed will also hold long memories of these 36 days of postelection madness. It was in these weeks, for example, that they got their first glimpse of how their new president reacts in a crisis. It was not a pretty sight.</p> <p>For Bush seemed to crack under pressure. The symbolic image was - and will remain - the boil that bubbled up on his cheek a day or two after polling. The image stuck because it seemed to fit a man barely able to handle stress.</p> <p>Instead he headed almost instantly for his Texas ranch. Even his friends admit that Bush did not follow the postelection campaign: while Gore watched the supreme court on CNN, Bush was in the gym. Indeed, the clearest impression to have emerged of Bush these past weeks is of an exercise fanatic - a man who has replaced his much-documented earlier addiction to alcohol with a fitness compulsion.</p> <p>There was more revealing imagery. The lead was taken throughout by James Baker, the veteran hardman and loyal retainer of the Bush dynasty, and Dick Cheney, the vice president-to-be and former defence secretary to Bush's father. Baker did the groundwork in Florida, while Cheney sorted out the transition. The impression formed of a Bush administration run by Daddy's friends, with George W as the callow youth allowed to serve as frontman - a dauphin in a restoration monarchy. As one acerbic New York columnist put it, Baker, Cheney, and the former Gulf war general Colin Powell are the \"grown-ups who keep sending poor George W off to play\".</p> <p>That's how it was during this strange period of election extra-time - and that's how it may well be for four more years. Bush will get to play with the toys - Air Force One, the White House situation room - while Daddy's country club friends do what the hell they like.</p> <p>Gore, by contrast, appeared like a new man in the post-election twilight. Americans had known that he was stubborn - that \"he would do anything to get elected\". But they also saw an Al Gore who remained apparently calm and smiling, even under the most intense pressure.</p> <p>Among Democrats who had previously had their doubts about the vice president, his stock began to rise. His doggedness was an asset: if that's how hard he would fight for his job, they wondered, imagine how he would battle for America.</p> <p>That perception, coupled with the belief that he was robbed, might act as the rocket fuel for a second Gore attempt on the White House in 2004. It is rare in the television era for a failed nominee to get a second chance, but everything about this contest was rare, if not unprecedented. Besides, Americans love a good story, and the sheer narrative appeal of a Bush-Gore rematch may prove irresistible.</p> <p>But the real legacy of the surreal days of autumn 2000 may well outlive both of these flawed men. Americans may finally look back on this episode as the moment when they realised they had to start taking their own medicine.</p> <p>For some Americans are already arguing that the US can no longer travel the world, telling smaller, weaker nations to embrace democracy, when their own leader has been installed in a courtroom fix. Instead, they might have to make some changes.</p> <p>There could be a flood of claims from voters saying that the systems of their particular state were also patchy and therefore unconstitutional, under the new standard set by the supreme court. The result may well be a drumbeat for a modern, standardised voting system - using new technology - across the country.</p> <p>More fundamentally, Americans are coming to see their own constitution more clearly. For the second time in two years, that 224-year-old document has been strained to breaking point as it was forced to apply to the 21st century. As with the impeachment affair, a text written for an age of horse carriages and quill pens had to cope with the demands of satellite TV and 24-hour news cycles.</p> <p>It was revealed to be creaking at the edges. Now, at last, Americans may see that a system which can allow the loser to win and the winner to lose cannot remain unchanged. Perhaps they will realise at last that the beauty of their constitution is that it contains within it the possibility of its own reform. Americans have that power.</p> <p>After the long, Alice-in-Wonderland autumn of 2000, they may finally decide to use it.</p> <p><br><b>What happens next</b></p> <p><b> December 18</b> Electoral college members meet in each state capital and send votes to Washington.</p> <p><b> December 27</b> Deadline for arrival of electoral college votes.</p> <p><b> January 3</b> New Congress convenes in Washington.</p> <p><b> January 5</b> Senate and House of Representatives count electoral college votes in joint session, and hear any objections.</p> <p>Gore will preside in twin roles as US vice president and president of the Senate.</p> <p><b> January 20</b> Inauguration day.

They will for ever doubt the legitimacy of the government that rules them. For Gore and his supporters will look back on these five long weeks as a series of Republican attempts - in one court or other - to stop citizens' votes being counted for fear of what they might reveal. Whether it was the constant delays that kept volunteers stewing in the heat of Palm Beach county, stopping them counting when time was already precious, or the endless procedures in assorted courts - county, circuit or supreme, state and federal - it all boiled down to one theme. The Republicans did not want all Florida's votes to be counted, and that has offended American democrats - with both a large and a small D. The talk of a virtual coup d'\u00e9tat will grow. Others less committed will also hold long memories of these 36 days of postelection madness. It was in these weeks, for example, that they got their first glimpse of how their new president reacts in a crisis. It was not a pretty sight. For Bush seemed to crack under pressure. The symbolic image was - and will remain - the boil that bubbled up on his cheek a day or two after polling. The image stuck because it seemed to fit a man barely able to handle stress. Instead he headed almost instantly for his Texas ranch. Even his friends admit that Bush did not follow the postelection campaign: while Gore watched the supreme court on CNN, Bush was in the gym. Indeed, the clearest impression to have emerged of Bush these past weeks is of an exercise fanatic - a man who has replaced his much-documented earlier addiction to alcohol with a fitness compulsion. There was more revealing imagery. The lead was taken throughout by James Baker, the veteran hardman and loyal retainer of the Bush dynasty, and Dick Cheney, the vice president-to-be and former defence secretary to Bush's father. Baker did the groundwork in Florida, while Cheney sorted out the transition. The impression formed of a Bush administration run by Daddy's friends, with George W as the callow youth allowed to serve as frontman - a dauphin in a restoration monarchy. As one acerbic New York columnist put it, Baker, Cheney, and the former Gulf war general Colin Powell are the \"grown-ups who keep sending poor George W off to play\". That's how it was during this strange period of election extra-time - and that's how it may well be for four more years. Bush will get to play with the toys - Air Force One, the White House situation room - while Daddy's country club friends do what the hell they like. Gore, by contrast, appeared like a new man in the post-election twilight. Americans had known that he was stubborn - that \"he would do anything to get elected\". But they also saw an Al Gore who remained apparently calm and smiling, even under the most intense pressure. Among Democrats who had previously had their doubts about the vice president, his stock began to rise. His doggedness was an asset: if that's how hard he would fight for his job, they wondered, imagine how he would battle for America. That perception, coupled with the belief that he was robbed, might act as the rocket fuel for a second Gore attempt on the White House in 2004. It is rare in the television era for a failed nominee to get a second chance, but everything about this contest was rare, if not unprecedented. Besides, Americans love a good story, and the sheer narrative appeal of a Bush-Gore rematch may prove irresistible. But the real legacy of the surreal days of autumn 2000 may well outlive both of these flawed men. Americans may finally look back on this episode as the moment when they realised they had to start taking their own medicine. For some Americans are already arguing that the US can no longer travel the world, telling smaller, weaker nations to embrace democracy, when their own leader has been installed in a courtroom fix. Instead, they might have to make some changes. There could be a flood of claims from voters saying that the systems of their particular state were also patchy and therefore unconstitutional, under the new standard set by the supreme court. The result may well be a drumbeat for a modern, standardised voting system - using new technology - across the country. More fundamentally, Americans are coming to see their own constitution more clearly. For the second time in two years, that 224-year-old document has been strained to breaking point as it was forced to apply to the 21st century. As with the impeachment affair, a text written for an age of horse carriages and quill pens had to cope with the demands of satellite TV and 24-hour news cycles. It was revealed to be creaking at the edges. Now, at last, Americans may see that a system which can allow the loser to win and the winner to lose cannot remain unchanged. Perhaps they will realise at last that the beauty of their constitution is that it contains within it the possibility of its own reform. Americans have that power. After the long, Alice-in-Wonderland autumn of 2000, they may finally decide to use it. What happens next December 18 Electoral college members meet in each state capital and send votes to Washington. December 27 Deadline for arrival of electoral college votes. January 3 New Congress convenes in Washington. January 5 Senate and House of Representatives count electoral college votes in joint session, and hear any objections. Gore will preside in twin roles as US vice president and president of the Senate. January 20 Inauguration day. George W Bush and vice president-elect Dick Cheney are sworn in. They take office.",

In two of the four test cases, the environment secretary had \"called in\" planning applications to determine them himself after local authorities indicated they intended to grant planning permission for a car salvage operation and a leisure centre, both in Essex. The third case involved proposals to build warehouses on Alconbury airfield, Cambridgeshire, which is Ministry of Defence land. The MoD had entered into a profit-sharing deal with the developers, and the government, therefore, had a financial interest in the outcome of a planning appeal.

In exceptionally promising economic circumstances, the party has failed to place itself at the centre of American politics. The political prospects of Mr Gore himself are also now in question. For an incumbent vice-president to be ousted from the White House at a time of sustained economic prosperity, domestic tranquillity and international peace - and when the outgoing administration enjoyed record approval ratings - ought to be politically unforgiveable.</p> <p>If this were November 8, the political obituary writers would say that Mr Gore threw it away and that his career as a major national politician must be over. But his prospects have changed. Last night's expected concession speech might even have been the opening shot of the 2004 Gore-Bush rematch.</p> <p>Senator Kent Conrad, a Democrat, said last night that it was \"very hard to know\" whether Mr Gore could try again in four years.</p> <p>\"That is several lifetimes in politics and that makes it hard to predict. There are lots of other capable people who, no doubt, will step forward.\"</p> <p>But Mr Gore's achievements in defeat in the 2000 election cannot be lightly dismissed.

      "bodyText": "Democrats reacted with anger to Al Gore's defeat last night, with some senior officials barely able to conceal their bitterness at an election they claimed had been fixed. \"There was a campaign of voter suppression in Florida which has left very bitter feelings,\" a senior aide to President Bill Clinton said. \"Gore won but he was robbed.\" For the first time in half a century the Democrats now control neither the White House, the Senate, nor the House of Representatives. In exceptionally promising economic circumstances, the party has failed to place itself at the centre of American politics. The political prospects of Mr Gore himself are also now in question. For an incumbent vice-president to be ousted from the White House at a time of sustained economic prosperity, domestic tranquillity and international peace - and when the outgoing administration enjoyed record approval ratings - ought to be politically unforgiveable. If this were November 8, the political obituary writers would say that Mr Gore threw it away and that his career as a major national politician must be over. But his prospects have changed. Last night's expected concession speech might even have been the opening shot of the 2004 Gore-Bush rematch. Senator Kent Conrad, a Democrat, said last night that it was \"very hard to know\" whether Mr Gore could try again in four years. \"That is several lifetimes in politics and that makes it hard to predict. There are lots of other capable people who, no doubt, will step forward.\" But Mr Gore's achievements in defeat in the 2000 election cannot be lightly dismissed. He won more votes on November 7 than any Democratic presidential candidate in history - more than Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, John Kennedy or Lyndon Johnson. Only Ronald Reagan has ever won more support from Americans than Mr Gore did last month. And no candidate since 1888 has won more votes than his opponent and not moved into the White House. For all the talk about bipartisanship under a Bush administration there will be no magnanimous job offer to Mr Gore - and he would not accept it anyway. A Los Angeles radio station has offered Mr Gore a $200,000 a year contract to host a show but that seems even less likely.

He is another Texan oilman who sees the world through an oilman's eyes, with an inherent tendency to equate US interests with those of American big business. He was put on the ticket to compensate Bush Jr's inexperience in foreign affairs. This is, after all, a president elect who has been overseas fewer than half a dozen times in his life. It is reasonable to assume Mr Cheney will be taking the lead White House role in foreign policy-making in at least the first months of the new administration. Like Al Gore, he is likely to wield more power than has traditionally been the case for running mates. But unlike the outgoing veep, he is unlikely to be spending much of his power or time at global warming conferences. </p> <p><b>Colin Powell</b><br> </p> <p>Another face from the old Bush court who as national security adviser helped run the Gulf war campaign alongside Mr Cheney. He is almost certain to become the new secretary of state, replacing Madeleine Albright's enthusiasm for humanitarian intervention (Kosovo is still thought of as \"Madeleine's war\") with the caution and pragmatism of a soldier who rose to the top by taking few risks and making few mistakes. </p> <p><b>Condoleezza Rice</b><br> </p> <p>Ms Rice, who is expected to become President elect Bush's national security adviser, is cut from similar cloth. The Stanford academic is a generation younger than her two colleagues but she shares their mindset. As the Russian affairs adviser in the first Bush White House, she is a child of the cold war, with a much more hawkish view on Russia and China - as rivals rather than partners. She has also led the withdrawal from humanitarian intervention, promising Americans that their armed forces \"are not the world's 911\", an emergency service on 24-hour call. </p> <p><b>Paul Wolfowitz </b><br> </p> <p>Mr Wolfowitz is likely to become the fourth corner of the new foreign policy. Mr Cheney's undersecretary in the old Bush regime is another cold war veteran who has been biding his time since as dean of the Johns Hopkins University's school of advanced international studies in Washington. A cold war hawk, he has been highly critical of the outgoing administration's handling of relations with Russia and China. </p> <p><b>Larry Lindsey</b><br> </p> <p>One of the godfathers of supply-side economics, under which economic growth is fostered by tax cuts for the rich. Mr Lindsey is a former governor of the federal reserve and served the president elect's father as a White House economic policy guru. He is tipped to replace Larry Summers at the treasury, although it is possible that job will be given to a financier to build a bridge to Wall Street. In that case, Walter Shipley, the retired Chase Manhattan chairman, or Donald Marron, the head of investment house PaineWebber, could get the job, in which case Mr Lindsey might be compensated with the top job at the White House national economic council thinktank set up by President Clinton. </p> <p><b>Andrew Card</b><br> </p> <p>Andy Card was deputy chief of staff under the governor's father, and has already been selected as a White House chief of staff. As a former lobbyist for General Motors, he is likely to be a friendly gatekeeper, opening the gates on Pennsylvania Avenue wide for big business, which donated a record amount to the Bush campaign and will be looking for a return on its investment. </p> <p><b>Katherine Harris</b><br> </p> <p>The Florida secretary of state's future will be closely watched, since she played such a significant role in the events of the past month. She is a citrus heiress, who before becoming forever associated with dimpled ballots and hanging chads was Florida's cultural tsar.

The charges were brought by British Transport police after an investigation into the death of Sophie George, seven, on July 29 at Ynyslas, near Borth, Mid Wales. Sophie's friend, Kymberley Allock, eight, was also killed in the accident last July. British Transport police last night charged Sophie's stepfather, Gareth Edwards, 33, and her mother, Amanda Edwards, 34, over both deaths. They were bailed to appear before Aberystwyth magistrates on December 20. The tragedy shocked the village community of Tre'rddol where the families of both girls lived. The girls and Kymberley's brother Mathew, 11, were being looked after by Sophie's parents when the accident happened. Sophie and Kymberley were struck by a two-coach Shrewsbury-Aberystwyth train as they played on the bridge after a Saturday afternoon picnic. The driver of the train was treated for shock after the accident. It is thought that the girls had been throwing stones into the water from the bridge and had not seen the train approach. The spot, two miles from the village and accessible only on foot, is midway between Ynyshir nature reserve and the holiday village of Ynyslas. It is a popular haunt for local young people, with many visiting it to catch flatfish or collect cockles. A public footpath and stile ends near the bridge, which crosses the River Clettwr, and when the tide is in it has been the custom for people to walk over the railway line to reach the other side. After the incident, Kymberley's father Tony Allcock, 39, said: \"They were not dare devils in any shape or form. They were innocent young children who were taken away for no reason at all. \"At the moment, my family and I do not blame anyone for this tragedy, but answers have to be found.\" He demanded safety measures on the railway bridge.

      "bodyText": "The impeachment trial of the Philippines' president, Joseph Estrada, entered its most critical phase yesterday when the main prosecution witness, the provincial governor who made the initial corruption allegations, began giving evidence. However, Governor Luis Singson, a former drinking and gambling buddy of the president, failed to offer the extraordinary new revelations he had promised in a morning radio interview. He spent hours going through an extremely detailed ledger explaining how he had collected \u00a35.5m in protection money from illegal lottery gangs and passed it on to Mr Estrada, his relations and cronies in fortnightly instalments. The president is facing four indictments: bribery, corruption, betrayal of public trust and violating the constitution. If two-thirds of the country's 22 senators, who are acting as judges, convict him of any of the charges he will be removed from office. \"I was the one who actually handed the money to President Estrada,\" Mr Singson told the hushed court in proceedings broadcast live across the country. The president's name was not on the ledger, but Mr Singson said the initials AS referred to Asiong Salonga, the name of a character played by Mr Estrada, a former movie star. The evidence varied little from the initial claims he made in October when he first blew the whistle on alleged presidential complicity in the numbers-game scam. Mr Singson said yesterday that operators of the game, called jueteng, were asked to send 3% of their earnings to the president. During testimony that included him brandishing a $100,000 (\u00a369,000) cheque made payable to cash that allegedly ended up in Mr Estrada's account, Mr Singson also claimed that he collected \u00a31.8m in taxes that were meant to be spent on improving tobacco farmers' welfare. Hours before beginning his testimony in the five-day hearing Mr Singson told a radio station that he would give explosive new details of the president's corruption. \"I promise to drop a new bomb,\" he said. \"I'm not going to tell you now because it won't be a new bomb any more.\" Mr Singson was initially scheduled to begin testifying on Tuesday but prosecutors held him back for a day, until December 13, in the hope that it would prove unlucky for the extremely superstitious Mr Estrada. However, Mr Estrada was as ebullient as ever yesterday, reiterating his innocence. \"I have not received a single cent from any form of illegal gambling,\" he said. \"My conscience is clear. I am not hiding anything from our people and I believe that in the end the truth will prevail.\" The court has already heard from six other witnesses how they had passed money on to members of Mr Estrada's inner circle. None of their evidence, however, is considered strong enough to convict Mr Estrada by itself. It is still unclear whether prosecutors have enough votes to secure a conviction. Prosecutors on Tuesday tried to demonstrate that Mr Estrada accepted bribes from Mr Singson. They played excerpts of a press conference which took place on November 10 when Mr Estrada admitted being offered \u00a32.8m, but insisted he rejected it. The money ended up in the account of a foundation Mr Estrada controlled, a fact he never declared, claiming he was \"too busy\".

A Japanese tanker reportedly picked up four people but hopes of finding other survivors from the two small vessels which were carrying a total of 167 people appear slim. The asylum seekers, thought to be from the Middle East, had paid smugglers to be taken from Indonesia, across the Timor Sea to the remote Australian island of Ashmore Reef, 200 miles north-west of the mainland Australia. Australia's hard-line immigration minister, Philip Ruddock, described the deaths as \"tragic\" but said it should act as a deterrent to others seeking refuge in Australia. \"I think it's appropriate that people are aware of the very significant risks involved,\" he said. \"If people are intent on getting into vulnerable vessels on very dangerous seas then there are risks associated with it. \"We're dealing here with a group of people whose intention was to arrive without no tice, clandestinely, on vessels that really don't have the sort of navigational devices and identification equipment that would enable a search-and-rescue operation to be mounted,\" said Mr Ruddock. Conditions in the Timor Sea were \"atrocious\", Mr Ruddock said, following the 175mph winds of Cyclone Sam which battered the north-west coast over the weekend. A search of Australian waters by the navy, customs service and federal police will resume tomorrow. The route from Indonesia to Ashmore Reef is well-travelled by refugees, usually taking two to three days. Australia has a permanent customs patrol stationed in the area, and more than 1,000 \"boat people\" have been intercepted since July, most en route to the reef. \"Recently we've seen people from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria and a small number of Palestinians,\" Mr Ruddock said. Indonesian authorities said that the smuggling ringleader who chartered the boats which sank yesterday had fled Indonesia, fearing reprisals. More than 250 suspected illegal immigrants were feared drowned in April after three boats went missing between Indonesia and Australia. Mr Ruddock estimated that a third of all boats trying to smuggle people into Australia never arrive. Canberra has met increasing international criticism over its treatment of asylum seekers. Three United Nations reports have condemned Canberra's human rights record this year, criticising the detention of asylum seekers aged under 16 and attacking the two-year wait immigrants endure to receive social security benefits. Guidelines from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees say that asylum seekers should only be detained during the initial assessment and that children should be spared detention. The Australian government places all asylum seekers, including women and children, in privately run detention camps while their claims are assessed. A government-led internal investigation is currently under way at the Woomera detention centre, in South Australia, after widespread claims of ill-treatment and child abuse. The former conservative prime minister Malcolm Fraser called Woomera a \"hell hole\", while Amnesty International has requested access to the centre to investigate reports that children were restrained with plastic handcuffs. Mr Ruddock claims that the detention camps, which provide basic facilities inside barbed-wire compounds, act as an important deterrent to asylum seekers considering Australia as a possible refuge.

      "body": "<p>Julian Dixon, one of the most influential and well-regarded black members of the US House of Representatives, has died suddenly aged 66. In November, the Los Angeles suburban district he had represented for the past 22 years returned him to Washington with 84% of its vote. The area bears no resemblance to the common stereotype of a Los Angeles black-majority neighbourhood.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The German opera director G\u00f6tz Friedrich, who has died of cancer in Berlin aged 70, leapt into the spotlight in 1972 with a Bayreuth staging of Tannh\u00e4user that presented the Pilgrims' Chorus as modern socialist workers shaking clenched fists at the well-heeled, dinner-jacketed audience. Frederic Spotts's 1994 history of the Wagner festival called it \"the most blatantly ideological production ever\" at Bayreuth.</p> <p>The policy of Wieland and Wolfgang Wagner, after the festival was allowed to restart in 1951, had been to avoid politics. At Bayreuth, Hitler's ghost still walked. Frau Winifred, their English-born mother, continued to entertain old Nazis and loathed the new Bayreuth style. But Friedrich was from East Germany, and a leading disciple of Walter Felsenstein at the Berlin Komische Oper.</p> <p>Ironically, despite the clenched fists, he defected to the west within a few months - heading for posts in Hamburg, and a historic Covent Garden partnership with Colin Davis and the new Ring production which sealed it. But, unlike his fellow East German Ruth Berghaus, who was to prove a more potent and substantial operatic innovator, he was never really an ideologue (though he was always proud of the role his father played, as an ordinary soldier, in the generals' plot to assassinate Hitler).</p> <p>There should not have been any opening for Friedrich at the Royal Opera. But in 1971 Peter Hall had parachuted out of his planned Covent Garden partnership with Davis, intended as replacement for Georg Solti's regime, and the general administrator John Tooley was desperate to find a substitute. Friedrich's succ\u00e8s de scandale at Bayreuth happened at just the right time, and Tooley - no doubt with trepidation - persuaded Friedrich to come and direct Covent Garden's new Ring cycle to mark the work's centenary. Friedrich initially hoped for his Tannh\u00e4user designer, Jurgen Rose. But Tooley needed the security of a more renowned name and slotted in the brilliant Czech Josef Svoboda.</p> <p>What Friedrich brought to the Royal Opera, both while building his Ring and in other work like Freischutz, Idomeneo and Lulu that he undertook as principal producer, was an operatic professionalism in depth that had never actually been part of the establishment there before. The German training for a career in the theatre was something that simply had (and has, alas, still) no equivalent in Britain.</p> <p>Friedrich studied theatre history for four years in Weimar, and then went straight to the Komische Oper as an assistant to Felsenstein, with whom he remained for two decades, teaching dramaturgy. Like Felsenstein's other leading disciples, Joachim Herz and Harry Kupfer, who were part of the same influential wave of East German imports in London and Cardiff in the 1970s, he was totally committed to the concept of \"realistic music theatre\".</p> <p>Opera was basically not to be seen as something culinary for browsing bourgeoisie - just a matter of taste. Rather, it was like the work of Brecht's Berliner Ensemble - in earnest. Which was the only justification, as Friedrich told me, for spending all that taxpayers' money. \"If opera had no social function,\" he once said, \"there would be no reason to keep this sound museum going.\"</p> <p>The Komische Oper in East Berlin was where the artistic policy of English National Opera originated. After the war, Felsenstein (with certainly no sentiment for communism) was determined that his audience should fully understand their opera, and have a thrillingly theatrical experience. Singing was to be less important, which suited the then financial realities. The quality of the Komische product depended on the fact that directors were working with a company and within a house style.</p> <p>Friedrich, according to Eleanor Fazan, who was often his movement director at Covent Garden, was extraordinarily passionate about his artistic objectives. \"He would shout and scream, and of course the stage management hated him for it. But he was tremendous to work with. If you were responsive to his ideas he loved it, and would take great pains to involve you in his vision.\"</p> <p>His assistant on the Royal Opera's Ring, completed in 1976, was Elijah Moshinsky, for whom the director's exercise of power was a forceful example.</p> <p>After the opening night of his G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung at the Royal Opera in 1976, Friedrich told me, \"I know in some ways I'm a foolish producer giving hostages to the critics by talking very theoretically in advance about what I'm trying to do. But yesterday I felt that, for all those long six hours, the audience was not shifting in their seats. It was like an audience watching a thriller.\"</p> <p>He also felt that, though Covent Garden then was technologically terrible, \"I, as a foreigner, know that this Ring could not have been done in any other house in Europe. People here were working 14 or 16 hours a day.\"</p> <p>Friedrich was not a teamwork man, but a dictator. \"He was difficult because he doesn't give you any freedom\", Elisabeth Soderstrom, his Jenufa in Stockholm in 1975, said. \"I had perhaps other ideas about the reactions of Jenufa. It took me a very long time to bring them out through his pattern. But when I saw the rest of the jigsaw puzzle around me I understood him better.\"</p> <p>Josef Svoboda's Ring design for Friedrich used a powerful piston to raise, swivel and incline a platform, sometimes like the lid of a box, sometimes like a stage floor. This was very suggestive of a world below what you could see (Niebelhem) or just offstage, enormously enhancing the sense of epic fantasy. Jurgen Rose's Bayreuth Tannh\u00e4user presented the Wartburg like a wedding cake iced with wooden flooring: Friedrich got Gwynneth Jones as Elisabeth to throw herself exuberantly into the role, racing along the top of this platform before launching into \"Dich teure halle\".</p> <p>Svoboda's ideas for Friedrich's first Covent Garden Ring were much more compelling, in a middle European expressionist style, than Peter Sykora's ideas for Friedrich's later, 1991, Berlin and Washington Ring which Covent Garden picked up as a poor substitute for the failed Yuri Lyubimov Ring in 1988. This was a sign of desperation, and really done just to help Bernard Haitink have his own Ring staging.</p> <p>The limitation of Friedrich's work in the opera tended to be his fairly conventional visual taste - in terms of prevailing German expressionism. Leather greatcoats, what looked like swimming caps covering women's hair, heavy rather ungainly clothes, a kind of theatrical costuming that belonged nowhere except in the theatre - these became the tired norms of his work. In fact his aesthetic insensitivity made it difficult for him to move beyond the standard visual references of German operatic theatre. A director like Patrice Chereau, whose Bayreuth Ring was even more of a resonating scandal and success than Friedrich's Tannh\u00e4user, was always more aesthetically sophisticated - more romantic perhaps, and no less interpretative. Friedrich's Ring suffered by comparison with Chereau's.</p> <p>His interpretative style and vision were never as original or challenging as Chereau's and Berghaus's best work - though many early productions, such as his Meistersinger in Stockholm, were deservedly admired. Like many who get fame as enfants terribles for a brief time, Friedrich was overtaken by younger, more lively talents as the 1980s wore on. What he liked about his Ring designer Svoboda, he told me, was that Svoboda was neither picturesque nor pictorial, but understood the true expressive nature of the theatre space. \"Aesthetic in the theatre is for me - this sounds awful - function. It must function. I don't mean only the technical function, but narrative, epic, dramaturgical, poetic.\"</p> <p>In 1981 Friedrich became one of the most powerful figures on the German operatic scene, as Intendant of the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, the Western sector of the city's answer to the East's old Staatsoper. Berlin's problem, that since reunification it has too much operatic plant for one city, still awaits successful rationalisation.</p> <p>Friedrich's work at its best was true both to the music and to the meaning. He didn't believe it would be appropriate to mess around with the overt narrative of a Puccini opera, for example. But his Aida at the circus theatre, the Carre in Amsterdam, was a superb ritual - set in the round, which, while it made the final incarceration of the pair of doomed lovers problematical, made the public scenes in the first half very thrilling.</p> <p>He was not a director for The Marriage of Figaro. He didn't have much interest in comedy. At Bayreuth, that initial Tannh\u00e4user and the later Parsifal in a sort of time-travel science fiction tower were startling and intensely effective. At the Royal Opera House his Lulu, his Caspar David Friedrich-inspired Freischutz, and his 1970s (first) Ring cycle were among the most accomplished opera productions Covent Garden has enjoyed.</p> <p>When he decamped to the west Friedrich left behind his first wife, actress Ruth Maria Kubitschek, and his son Alexander. His second wife, with whom he also had a son, Johannes, was the American opera-singer Karan Armstrong - Lulu in his 1981 Covent Garden staging of the Berg. His final staging - Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors - was premiered only last week in Berlin.</p> <p>\u0095 G\u00f6tz Friedrich, opera director and producer, born August 4 1930; died December 12 2000</p>",

The quality of the Komische product depended on the fact that directors were working with a company and within a house style. Friedrich, according to Eleanor Fazan, who was often his movement director at Covent Garden, was extraordinarily passionate about his artistic objectives. \"He would shout and scream, and of course the stage management hated him for it. But he was tremendous to work with. If you were responsive to his ideas he loved it, and would take great pains to involve you in his vision.\" His assistant on the Royal Opera's Ring, completed in 1976, was Elijah Moshinsky, for whom the director's exercise of power was a forceful example. After the opening night of his G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung at the Royal Opera in 1976, Friedrich told me, \"I know in some ways I'm a foolish producer giving hostages to the critics by talking very theoretically in advance about what I'm trying to do. But yesterday I felt that, for all those long six hours, the audience was not shifting in their seats. It was like an audience watching a thriller.\" He also felt that, though Covent Garden then was technologically terrible, \"I, as a foreigner, know that this Ring could not have been done in any other house in Europe. People here were working 14 or 16 hours a day.\" Friedrich was not a teamwork man, but a dictator. \"He was difficult because he doesn't give you any freedom\", Elisabeth Soderstrom, his Jenufa in Stockholm in 1975, said. \"I had perhaps other ideas about the reactions of Jenufa. It took me a very long time to bring them out through his pattern. But when I saw the rest of the jigsaw puzzle around me I understood him better.\" Josef Svoboda's Ring design for Friedrich used a powerful piston to raise, swivel and incline a platform, sometimes like the lid of a box, sometimes like a stage floor. This was very suggestive of a world below what you could see (Niebelhem) or just offstage, enormously enhancing the sense of epic fantasy. Jurgen Rose's Bayreuth Tannh\u00e4user presented the Wartburg like a wedding cake iced with wooden flooring: Friedrich got Gwynneth Jones as Elisabeth to throw herself exuberantly into the role, racing along the top of this platform before launching into \"Dich teure halle\". Svoboda's ideas for Friedrich's first Covent Garden Ring were much more compelling, in a middle European expressionist style, than Peter Sykora's ideas for Friedrich's later, 1991, Berlin and Washington Ring which Covent Garden picked up as a poor substitute for the failed Yuri Lyubimov Ring in 1988. This was a sign of desperation, and really done just to help Bernard Haitink have his own Ring staging. The limitation of Friedrich's work in the opera tended to be his fairly conventional visual taste - in terms of prevailing German expressionism. Leather greatcoats, what looked like swimming caps covering women's hair, heavy rather ungainly clothes, a kind of theatrical costuming that belonged nowhere except in the theatre - these became the tired norms of his work. In fact his aesthetic insensitivity made it difficult for him to move beyond the standard visual references of German operatic theatre. A director like Patrice Chereau, whose Bayreuth Ring was even more of a resonating scandal and success than Friedrich's Tannh\u00e4user, was always more aesthetically sophisticated - more romantic perhaps, and no less interpretative. Friedrich's Ring suffered by comparison with Chereau's. His interpretative style and vision were never as original or challenging as Chereau's and Berghaus's best work - though many early productions, such as his Meistersinger in Stockholm, were deservedly admired. Like many who get fame as enfants terribles for a brief time, Friedrich was overtaken by younger, more lively talents as the 1980s wore on. What he liked about his Ring designer Svoboda, he told me, was that Svoboda was neither picturesque nor pictorial, but understood the true expressive nature of the theatre space. \"Aesthetic in the theatre is for me - this sounds awful - function. It must function. I don't mean only the technical function, but narrative, epic, dramaturgical, poetic.\" In 1981 Friedrich became one of the most powerful figures on the German operatic scene, as Intendant of the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, the Western sector of the city's answer to the East's old Staatsoper. Berlin's problem, that since reunification it has too much operatic plant for one city, still awaits successful rationalisation. Friedrich's work at its best was true both to the music and to the meaning. He didn't believe it would be appropriate to mess around with the overt narrative of a Puccini opera, for example. But his Aida at the circus theatre, the Carre in Amsterdam, was a superb ritual - set in the round, which, while it made the final incarceration of the pair of doomed lovers problematical, made the public scenes in the first half very thrilling. He was not a director for The Marriage of Figaro. He didn't have much interest in comedy. At Bayreuth, that initial Tannh\u00e4user and the later Parsifal in a sort of time-travel science fiction tower were startling and intensely effective. At the Royal Opera House his Lulu, his Caspar David Friedrich-inspired Freischutz, and his 1970s (first) Ring cycle were among the most accomplished opera productions Covent Garden has enjoyed. When he decamped to the west Friedrich left behind his first wife, actress Ruth Maria Kubitschek, and his son Alexander. His second wife, with whom he also had a son, Johannes, was the American opera-singer Karan Armstrong - Lulu in his 1981 Covent Garden staging of the Berg. His final staging - Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors - was premiered only last week in Berlin. \u0095 G\u00f6tz Friedrich, opera director and producer, born August 4 1930; died December 12 2000",

It (almost) makes our 100% hand-count electoral system seem sophisticated and fair. Steve Norman Edinburgh Norm1962@hotmail.com \u0095 It is worth reflecting once again that the winner is the candidate with the fewer votes, largely because of an arcane system which was specifically designed to temper the expression of the will of the people. The chance to rectify this situation was disallowed because votes could not be counted properly. As Jim Royle might say: \"World's greatest democracy? My arse!\" Rod Lipscombe Faversham, Kent rodlipscombe@yahoo.com \u0095 I seem to remember the law lords' decision on Pinochet being rescinded because one of them was perceived to have a conflict of interest due to his connections with Amnesty International. Isn't the lesson of the US election that it is folly to have a judiciary which is politically appointed and partisan? Martin Fey Bristol martin.fey@capitafhe.co.uk \u0095 Al Gore wins 300,000 more votes yet Dubya, aided by his father (former director of the CIA), his brother (governor of Florida) and his cousin (Fox TV anchorman who fed sensitive information to the Bush camp on election night) is declared the winner. Hail to the thief. Brian Glancey Airdrie, Lanarks \u0095 Talk of the similarity of the current American electoral chaos to that of 1876 prompts me to a second comparison, one that offers hope to the beleaguered Gore camp. In 1828 another leading Tennessee Democrat stormed to victory in the presidential contest. The basis of Andrew Jackson's campaign was that, having received the highest popular vote four years earlier, he had been deprived of the presidency after a \"corrupt bargain\" between his opponents.

Aides who worked nearly two years on Gore's presidential campaign betrayed on Wednesday - in not-for-attribution remarks and casual asides - their bitterness about a split Supreme Court ruling they viewed as partisan and about Republican advantages they saw as stacked against them. Gore had mounted his recount in a state where Bush's brother, Jeb, is governor and the Republican secretary of state who certified Bush's victory was also co-chairwoman of his Florida campaign. Outside the residence, where Gore was with wife and their four children, two of whom hastened from homes out of town, a lone supporter held a \"Gore 2004\" sign. Gore must leave the house before Republican Dick Cheney is sworn in as his replacement on January 20. For the eight years they lived there, the Gores loaned brother-in-law Frank Hunger the Arlington, Virginia, home where Tipper Gore grew up and they raised their own family. Associates said Gore, 52, had been so focused on the five weeks of legal wrangling that he never spoke - out loud, at least - about where his life might turn in defeat. Aboard Air Force Two one September night, the one-time newspaper reporter mused about maybe being \"a writer of some kind.\" Some who know him well speculated he might turn to academia. Both Princeton and Harvard, his alma mater, will have vacancies at the helm next year.

Although they never actually seemed likely to lose a listless quarter-final, it was not until the night had been dragged into a period of extra-time that they seemed even remotely interested in winning it. Liverpool now meet Sunderland or Crystal Palace for a place in the final of a tournament they once dominated. \"I'm simply happy to be through because I knew that this would prove a difficult night for us,\" said the Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier. Fulham's voyage of discovery had turned into a genuine adventure, a Boys' Own caper awash with heroes and villains. Yes, they came unstuck last night but they will shed few tears, safe in the knowledge that the next time they visit Anfield they will certainly be contesting Premiership points. It is not difficult to understand why their progress has been so impressive for they do constitute a genuine team, a smart, authoritative unit within which the more flamboyant individual elements are submerged for the collective good. Their work ethic is sound, they boast discipline where it matters - at the heart of defence and in central midfield - and there is a general air of efficiency to Jean Tigana's side. The same can usually be said of the modern Liverpool but on a cold and inhospitable night, the Merseysiders' potential was diluted by the loss of key men to untimely injury - that and the lack of cohesion so frighteningly apparent at the weekend when Ipswich had ended their lengthy unbeaten home sequence. Dietmar Hamann and Christian Ziege did not make it and Michael Owen became the latest household name to discover that Houllier's desire to run with a Chelsea-style squad rotation system will occasionally bring the sort of disappointment that, bearing in mind the Frenchman's ruthless streak, is best borne stoically and silently. Predictably, in the wake of Sunday's defeat, Emile Heskey was restored to the front line and he it was who caused the odd early flicker of consternation in a defence that was otherwise resolute. Fulham's intricate passing game actually drew the best out of their hosts, for Liverpool seemed determined that they would not only dominate but dominate in style. The chances mostly fell Liverpool's way. Heskey deposited a header on the roof of the net and Igor Biscan, on his full debut, steered in a shot that would have found its target had it not clipped a Fulham boot.

      "bodyText": "Europe's powerful tobacco lobby suffered a big setback yesterday after Euro MPs backed tough new rules forcing manufacturers to put shocking images of cancerous lungs and rotting teeth on cigarette packets. In a vote in Strasbourg, the parliament approved legislation obliging the industry, by 2003, to cover 30% of the front of every packet sold in the EU with a health warning. At the moment, in the UK, 6% of a packet's surface is taken up with a warning. There was immediate retaliation from the tobacco lobby which claimed that several of the measures approved by the parliament risked thousands of jobs, many in the UK. British American Tobacco warned that the decision to ban European factories from making cigarettes with a tar content of more than 10mg per cigarette for domestic consumption and export could be particularly damaging to employment. A representative of BAT said: \"This will act as a de facto export ban threatening the loss of 1,800 jobs in BAT factories, mainly in the UK, and a further 6,000 jobs among suppliers. \"We are calling upon the Council of Europe ministers - and Alan Milburn, the secretary of state for health - to help eliminate the export clause before it is too late.\" The industry now has one last chance to try to derail the measures as the final text of the directive will be hammered out between EU health ministers and Euro MPs in the new year with the European commission acting as go-between. John Bowis, the Conservatives' health spokesman, yesterday said that the directive as agreed could be challenged in the courts and argued that the decision to extend the rules to cigarettes earmarked for export was a step too far. But MEPs were adamant that they had acted in the public interest and confident that agreement over the final wording of the text would be swift and uncontroversial. \"There's quite a lot of common ground between the parliament and ministers and we should be able to see a final result by spring at the latest,\" said a source.

A few familiar signposts are still there. The heroine, who kips under a cloak of ash, is bullied by her stepsisters and finally gets her prince. But she is prey to self-doubt and is under the thumb of her stepmother, while her prince is an exiled Asian isolated and unhappy in his new country. </p> <p>Wertenbaker's biggest innovation is to suggest that the forest en route to the palace is populated by an animalised version of the Seven Deadly Sins, which are out to destroy humanity. She even adds a further allegorical figure, Sadness, who tries to tempt the ash girl towards death and battles with the Fairy in the Mirror for her soul. The result is a like a mix of CS Lewis and Sondheim's Into the Woods: an eclectic fairytale anthology. In packing so much in, Wertenbaker sometimes muddies the narrative. I couldn't work out why, if the cardinal vices were seeking to corrupt mankind, they didn't attack their prey on their way to, rather than from, the ball. </p> <p>Where Wertenbaker scores is in her eye for eccentric detail. One of the stepsisters doesn't even much fancy the prince - \"I only want a microscope,\" she petulantly announces. And the benign fairy, instead of being the usual wand-waving wonderwoman, is blessed with a studied vagueness. \"I have to change you into something horrid,\" she tells the cruel stepmother, as if she can't quite remember what. The truth is that the Cinderella myth is so rooted in our culture that it can take any number of variations; and Wertenbaker's version, which advises you to say no to your mother if she asks you to do something stupid such as amputating your toe, has an anarchic subversiveness that should appeal to children. </p> <p>Lucy Bailey's production and Angela Davies's designs also offer plenty of visual magic: letters whiz through the sky, arachnoids dangle over our heads and silhouetted figures process down castle steps as in an avant-garde Macbeth. Stephanie Pochin is a prettily introverted ash-girl, Rachel Smith is suitably snotty as her prince-spurning stepsister and, though I could have lived without the Seven Deadly Sins, I warmed to Alex Jones's Brummagem Slothbird, who scarcely had the energy to drag himself across the stage.

      "body": "<p>Zoe Rahman, a young, animated British pianist with a pigtail that threatens to get under her feet, is the perfect antidote to the fashionable view of the major labels that young people want cross-over, not straight-ahead, jazz. Rahman, who won the Perrier Young Jazz Musician of the Year award a couple of years ago, is a hugely promising musician of powerful technique, group sympathy and compositional skill, but for much of the time she's as straight-ahead as they come. The Central Bar in London's Old Street is the perfect intimate room in which to hear an inventive piano trio, except in one respect - it doesn't have a piano. Rahman had to use an electric keyboard, which detracts from her subtlety of nuance and dynamic control. But if her own considerable contribution wasn't ideally displayed, her group's collective expressiveness was consistently absorbing. Jeremy Brown is a quick, soft-toned, melodically original bassist, and Winston Clifford is one of the UK's most interesting small-group drummers - an ideal complement to any pianist. On Joe Henderson's Isotope (the leader apologising that the piece had to double as the sound-check), Rahman was still settling in. </p> <p>She often fell back on a favourite device, the percussively repeated single note against shifting chords - though Clifford's brushwork was like a constant, encouraging whisper in her ear. The original ballad Never Enough evolved into an entrancing dialogue with Clifford's hand-drumming, and a Danilo Perez Latin arrangement of Thelonious Monk's Bright Mississippi found Rahman's phrasing increasingly assured, crisply expressed and balancing spare lines against dancing Latin-jazz chording. The up-tempo original Apple Pie filled the small space with its emphatically rolling, McCoy Tyner-like theme, and a haunting How Long Has This Been Going On confirmed that Rahman's youth and ebullient swing are no obstacles to patient, meditative harmonic exploration. Rahman tours the north with this trio next month, so watch out for her.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Zoe Rahman, a young, animated British pianist with a pigtail that threatens to get under her feet, is the perfect antidote to the fashionable view of the major labels that young people want cross-over, not straight-ahead, jazz. Rahman, who won the Perrier Young Jazz Musician of the Year award a couple of years ago, is a hugely promising musician of powerful technique, group sympathy and compositional skill, but for much of the time she's as straight-ahead as they come. The Central Bar in London's Old Street is the perfect intimate room in which to hear an inventive piano trio, except in one respect - it doesn't have a piano. Rahman had to use an electric keyboard, which detracts from her subtlety of nuance and dynamic control. But if her own considerable contribution wasn't ideally displayed, her group's collective expressiveness was consistently absorbing. Jeremy Brown is a quick, soft-toned, melodically original bassist, and Winston Clifford is one of the UK's most interesting small-group drummers - an ideal complement to any pianist. On Joe Henderson's Isotope (the leader apologising that the piece had to double as the sound-check), Rahman was still settling in. She often fell back on a favourite device, the percussively repeated single note against shifting chords - though Clifford's brushwork was like a constant, encouraging whisper in her ear. The original ballad Never Enough evolved into an entrancing dialogue with Clifford's hand-drumming, and a Danilo Perez Latin arrangement of Thelonious Monk's Bright Mississippi found Rahman's phrasing increasingly assured, crisply expressed and balancing spare lines against dancing Latin-jazz chording. The up-tempo original Apple Pie filled the small space with its emphatically rolling, McCoy Tyner-like theme, and a haunting How Long Has This Been Going On confirmed that Rahman's youth and ebullient swing are no obstacles to patient, meditative harmonic exploration. Rahman tours the north with this trio next month, so watch out for her.",

It went into rehearsal at Covent Garden but, probably due to a row between Smollett and the management, the project was pulled before it reached the stage. </p> <p>Handel's score survives but Smollett's text is lost, so to perform the work the English Bach Festival have had to turn it into a kind of masque. The parts of the story that would have been declaimed by actors are presented in mime instead, and other Handel operas have been plundered to provide music for the extended ballet sequences. The resulting work, premiered 11 years ago but now brought \"home\" to WC2 for the first time, is a paradox: an attempt to recreate in a slavishly authentic manner a work that was never conceived in this format in the first place. </p> <p>The English Bach Festival came into being nearly 50 years ago pledging to present operas of this period \"as authentically as historical research will allow\". It is valid to have these traditions preserved but, in sticking to inflexible rules, the company risks having the audience catch a whiff of formaldehyde. The baroque gestures and dance movements employed with great sincerity throughout Alceste (in Tom Hawkes's direction and Sarah Cremer's choreography) can't help but look awkward to a 21st-century audience. Although lovingly recreated by Terence Emery, the costumes - tall feathered headdresses for the men, crinolines drawn up like Austrian blinds to display the women's feet - also provoked giggles rather than gasps. </p> <p>Musically, things were better, the small orchestra sounding neat and poised even in the Linbury's uncharitable acoustic. Conductor Lawrence Cummings shaped phrases energetically while driving the musicians along from the harpsichord. </p> <p>The singing was rather mixed, but Yvonne Barclay charmed the audience with her soft tone in Gentle Mor pheus, and Graeme Broadbent made a solid, resonant Charon.

In short, the three will be linked. A company won't be able to do well financially if it has a dubious environmental and social record because legislation, taxation and penalties will eat into its bottom line. And in many ways, they maintain, this is already happening. In the UK, a climate change levy and landfill tax are gradually driving up the cost of energy usage and waste disposal. Companies exist to make money, so if something is eating into their profits, you can be sure the board of directors will do something about it.",

Born in 1941, he was unable to support his family during the economic crisis that accompanied Russia's transition to capitalism, and was forced to move to Britain. </p> <p>Tuesday's concert at the Royal Festival Hall marked Shoot's most concentrated exposure on the London stage, although his work has already begun to establish itself internationally. Most significantly, the BBC commissioned his 1998 High Cross Symphony, which was premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Martyn Brabbins. </p> <p>With members of the Philharmonia, Brabbins was again the expert guide in two of Shoot's smaller-scale works for chamber ensemble: the 1992 Sinfonia da Camera No 4, scored for strings and tam-tam, and the 1997 Divertimento, for vibraphone, strings and solo recorder. </p> <p>The Sinfonia was composed just before Shoot emigrated, and the music's tightly wrought lyricism may speak of the torments of his financial situation. Yet this was actually a musically productive time for Shoot. As he says, \"The only thing that remained intact was music itself, for it didn't come in bank notes and couldn't succumb to inflation.\" In fact, the Sinfonia is more a technically accomplished essay than a tortuous lament. Compared with the overwhelming ferocity achieved by his older compatriot Galina Ustvolskaya, with a similar post-tonal language, Shoot's composition is tranquillity personified. Even the tam-tam is here a vehicle of colouristic restraint. </p> <p>The Divertimento synthesises Shoot's concert idiom with the film music style he created in his last years in Moscow, work he did simply to survive. Written for recorder virtuoso Piers Adams, this was music of an overt but inelegant populism. Shoot conjured bright colours, with whistling string harmonics set against the avian piping of the soloist - but not enough to sustain interest beyond the obvious curiosity of the form. </p> <p>Given the size and scope of Shoot's catalogue - and his predilection for larger forces - an orchestral showcase of Shoot's music would surely reveal more substantial sides of this intriguing output.</p>",

Born in 1941, he was unable to support his family during the economic crisis that accompanied Russia's transition to capitalism, and was forced to move to Britain. Tuesday's concert at the Royal Festival Hall marked Shoot's most concentrated exposure on the London stage, although his work has already begun to establish itself internationally. Most significantly, the BBC commissioned his 1998 High Cross Symphony, which was premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Martyn Brabbins. With members of the Philharmonia, Brabbins was again the expert guide in two of Shoot's smaller-scale works for chamber ensemble: the 1992 Sinfonia da Camera No 4, scored for strings and tam-tam, and the 1997 Divertimento, for vibraphone, strings and solo recorder. The Sinfonia was composed just before Shoot emigrated, and the music's tightly wrought lyricism may speak of the torments of his financial situation. Yet this was actually a musically productive time for Shoot. As he says, \"The only thing that remained intact was music itself, for it didn't come in bank notes and couldn't succumb to inflation.\" In fact, the Sinfonia is more a technically accomplished essay than a tortuous lament. Compared with the overwhelming ferocity achieved by his older compatriot Galina Ustvolskaya, with a similar post-tonal language, Shoot's composition is tranquillity personified. Even the tam-tam is here a vehicle of colouristic restraint. The Divertimento synthesises Shoot's concert idiom with the film music style he created in his last years in Moscow, work he did simply to survive. Written for recorder virtuoso Piers Adams, this was music of an overt but inelegant populism. Shoot conjured bright colours, with whistling string harmonics set against the avian piping of the soloist - but not enough to sustain interest beyond the obvious curiosity of the form. Given the size and scope of Shoot's catalogue - and his predilection for larger forces - an orchestral showcase of Shoot's music would surely reveal more substantial sides of this intriguing output.",
