Ramsay was besotted from their first encounter, and initially made a forlorn attempt at seduction. Later their relationship settled into a mind-bogglingly dedicated exchange of confidences, letters and gifts (not least an entire flat for Callow), a rather touching romance that was to last until her death. 'Dear, dear, dear Simon,' one of Peggy's letters breathes, 'you have a temperament that vibrates at the fall of a leaf.'

April's real home is the kind of place where 'near relations mount each other', as our heroine delicately puts it, and Ellen would like nothing better than for her to return there. What follows is almost the pure Lite romantic comedy implied by the book's repulsively Chic-Lit jacket, but not quite.

      "body": "<p>A debate between history and literature has opened in New York over Susan Sontag's acclaimed new novel In America, published here next week. Sontag is accused by amateur historian Ellen Lee of failing to credit sources.</p> <p>Sontag's historical fiction is about a Polish actress, Maryna Zalezowska, who ventures from Poland to an experimental Californian farming community. Instead of staying there she returns to acting and becomes a star. The book explores themes of emigration, exile, belonging and self-regeneration.</p> <p>The plot echoes the career of real-life actress Helena Modjeska, the particular interest of Lee, who helped found the Modjeska foundation in California. Now, Lee has told the New York Times that passages in the novel resembling parts of books about Modjeska, and her diaries, should be credited.</p> <p>The debate invokes the non-existence of attribution rules governing historical fiction and the question of how rules of acknowledgement that govern academic work can apply to fiction when it creates characters by using what author Thomas Mallon - supporting Sontag - calls 'scraps and traces of history'.</p> <p>Among the sources Lee believes should have been credited are books about the actress, Polish verse, old newspaper articles, and Modjeska's own Memories and Impressions . Lee says borrowing references is unacceptable. Sontag, however, is surprised by such a reaction.</p> <p>Sontag's eclectic oeuvre encompasses fiction, essays, films and plays, and has been important in developing the historical novel genre.</p> <p>Debating Lee in the New York Times, Sontag did not contest similarities between texts; rather, she posits counter-rules for historical fiction whereby a novelist is not required to annotate everything. Many are whimsical literary references, she says. 'The sources themselves are working with other sources, and they are using quotations from actual words,' says Sontag. Much of the other work mentioned by Lee, for instance, is from newspapers that Sontag traced.</p> <p>'All of us who deal with real characters in history,' she says, 'transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain. I've used these sources and completely transformed them.</p> <p>'There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "A debate between history and literature has opened in New York over Susan Sontag's acclaimed new novel In America, published here next week. Sontag is accused by amateur historian Ellen Lee of failing to credit sources. Sontag's historical fiction is about a Polish actress, Maryna Zalezowska, who ventures from Poland to an experimental Californian farming community. Instead of staying there she returns to acting and becomes a star. The book explores themes of emigration, exile, belonging and self-regeneration. The plot echoes the career of real-life actress Helena Modjeska, the particular interest of Lee, who helped found the Modjeska foundation in California. Now, Lee has told the New York Times that passages in the novel resembling parts of books about Modjeska, and her diaries, should be credited. The debate invokes the non-existence of attribution rules governing historical fiction and the question of how rules of acknowledgement that govern academic work can apply to fiction when it creates characters by using what author Thomas Mallon - supporting Sontag - calls 'scraps and traces of history'. Among the sources Lee believes should have been credited are books about the actress, Polish verse, old newspaper articles, and Modjeska's own Memories and Impressions . Lee says borrowing references is unacceptable. Sontag, however, is surprised by such a reaction. Sontag's eclectic oeuvre encompasses fiction, essays, films and plays, and has been important in developing the historical novel genre. Debating Lee in the New York Times, Sontag did not contest similarities between texts; rather, she posits counter-rules for historical fiction whereby a novelist is not required to annotate everything. Many are whimsical literary references, she says. 'The sources themselves are working with other sources, and they are using quotations from actual words,' says Sontag. Much of the other work mentioned by Lee, for instance, is from newspapers that Sontag traced. 'All of us who deal with real characters in history,' she says, 'transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain. I've used these sources and completely transformed them. 'There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.'",

In DM Thomas's radical reworking of Jane Eyre, the Rochesters find that married life does not run quite as smoothly as Charlotte Bront\u00eb had led us to believe it would. This alternative ending is, we learn, a personal fantasy jotted down by Miranda, a lecturer in women's studies who has been invited to Martinique to deliver a talk on Bront\u00eb. It is, Miranda muses, a way of exploring 'some of the repressed issues' in this much-loved novel. Naturally, 'repressed issues' means sex. 'Reader, you will expect me to draw a veil over the intimacies which transpire between a man and his wife. I am sorry to disappoint and offend you...' </p> <p>According to Miranda's imaginings, the Rochesters' marriage is never consummated. (We have strayed from the Bront\u00eb narrative immediately after the wedding - long before the birth of their son.) It takes two years for Jane to realise that something is wrong, but during a frank exchange with the former Miss Temple, her mentor at Lowood, Jane discovers that her relations with Rochester are, indeed, rather unconventional. After Jane has confronted her husband gingerly about this, he rides off in a fury and is thrown from his horse. At his funeral, she loses her faith and, discovering that there is in fact a Rochester heir, a boy who was left behind with Bertha's family (which comes, puzzlingly, from Martinique, rather than Jamaica, as in the source novel), sets off to find him for financial as well as personal reasons. </p> <p>This narrative is entwined with the sexual questings of Miranda, mistakenly addressed as 'Madame Bront\u00eb' by a Martinique official who misreads her details on arrival. Far away from her husband David, who is designing the Faith Zone in the Dome - as if it didn't have enough problems - Miranda sees the island as a happy hunting ground, and sweatily seduces a bartender, a cane-cutter and a transvestite. The Literary Review 's 'Bad Sex' judges will find a wealth of material here. </p> <p>Though Miranda professes to be madly political ('Columbus. Cortez. Nato. Bastards') and is deeply affected by the tale of Carib chiefs throwing themselves off cliffs in order to escape the white invaders, she is oblivious to the politics of her own situation: a bored Caucasian woman on holiday, industriously seducing the local population.</p> <p>If these chaps misunderstand, get too involved, then she loses her temper: 'Reader, I told him to piss off.' It's impossible to empathise with this hardboiled creature who, as the novel gets going, makes so much noise that she almost entirely drowns out poor old Jane. Miranda, whether abroad or at home playing up to her sicko dad, Ben, is a badly drawn satire; a clumsy poke in the eye of women's studies, which has celebrated the mad woman in the attic. </p> <p>There are some truly disturbing bits in the novel, but they're usually the bits that show how very wonky Thomas's horizon is, how skewwhiff his moral perspective. On Martinique, one of Miranda's more obliging conquests tells her that his girlfriend was delighted to hear about their encounter: 'She feel proud of me. Her man could get a lovely white woman.'</p> <p>Miranda makes it clear that her notebooks began as a lie, a forgery, to distract her father Ben from 'this Brooklyn Jewish harridan' who was threatening their intimacy. There's more than a nod in the direction of The Tempest: a bibliophile like Prospero, Ben has been abandoned - cast adrift! - by the rest of the family, for reasons which he finds a bit rich. 'What is this fucking puritan, politically correct modern world, where it's fine to fuck a dozen men up the bum in a bathhouse, but you can't make your own granddaughter giggle with a tickle of her little patate?' he fulminates. </p> <p> Jane Eyre has proved repeatedly that it's robust enough to endure - occasionally be enriched by - endless reworkings, of which Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea has been the most effective. Charlotte, on the other hand, sheds no light on the original, being embarrassingly self-indulgent. At heart, it fails because it does not engage with the characters drawn by Bront\u00eb, being far more interested in the rapacious cyphers who populate the contemporary part of the novel. DM Thomas, once f\u00eated for The White Hotel, bangs on so relentlessly about sex that before long you're desperate to treat him as you would an embarrassing party drunk, and order him a taxi, sharpish. But no matter. Charlotte Bront\u00eb can take whatever DM Thomas chooses to throw at her. Too much of the time, he is firing blanks.</p>",

It is, Miranda muses, a way of exploring 'some of the repressed issues' in this much-loved novel. Naturally, 'repressed issues' means sex. 'Reader, you will expect me to draw a veil over the intimacies which transpire between a man and his wife. I am sorry to disappoint and offend you...' According to Miranda's imaginings, the Rochesters' marriage is never consummated. (We have strayed from the Bront\u00eb narrative immediately after the wedding - long before the birth of their son.) It takes two years for Jane to realise that something is wrong, but during a frank exchange with the former Miss Temple, her mentor at Lowood, Jane discovers that her relations with Rochester are, indeed, rather unconventional. After Jane has confronted her husband gingerly about this, he rides off in a fury and is thrown from his horse. At his funeral, she loses her faith and, discovering that there is in fact a Rochester heir, a boy who was left behind with Bertha's family (which comes, puzzlingly, from Martinique, rather than Jamaica, as in the source novel), sets off to find him for financial as well as personal reasons. This narrative is entwined with the sexual questings of Miranda, mistakenly addressed as 'Madame Bront\u00eb' by a Martinique official who misreads her details on arrival. Far away from her husband David, who is designing the Faith Zone in the Dome - as if it didn't have enough problems - Miranda sees the island as a happy hunting ground, and sweatily seduces a bartender, a cane-cutter and a transvestite. The Literary Review 's 'Bad Sex' judges will find a wealth of material here. Though Miranda professes to be madly political ('Columbus. Cortez. Nato. Bastards') and is deeply affected by the tale of Carib chiefs throwing themselves off cliffs in order to escape the white invaders, she is oblivious to the politics of her own situation: a bored Caucasian woman on holiday, industriously seducing the local population. If these chaps misunderstand, get too involved, then she loses her temper: 'Reader, I told him to piss off.' It's impossible to empathise with this hardboiled creature who, as the novel gets going, makes so much noise that she almost entirely drowns out poor old Jane. Miranda, whether abroad or at home playing up to her sicko dad, Ben, is a badly drawn satire; a clumsy poke in the eye of women's studies, which has celebrated the mad woman in the attic. There are some truly disturbing bits in the novel, but they're usually the bits that show how very wonky Thomas's horizon is, how skewwhiff his moral perspective. On Martinique, one of Miranda's more obliging conquests tells her that his girlfriend was delighted to hear about their encounter: 'She feel proud of me. Her man could get a lovely white woman.' Miranda makes it clear that her notebooks began as a lie, a forgery, to distract her father Ben from 'this Brooklyn Jewish harridan' who was threatening their intimacy. There's more than a nod in the direction of The Tempest: a bibliophile like Prospero, Ben has been abandoned - cast adrift! - by the rest of the family, for reasons which he finds a bit rich. 'What is this fucking puritan, politically correct modern world, where it's fine to fuck a dozen men up the bum in a bathhouse, but you can't make your own granddaughter giggle with a tickle of her little patate?' he fulminates. Jane Eyre has proved repeatedly that it's robust enough to endure - occasionally be enriched by - endless reworkings, of which Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea has been the most effective. Charlotte, on the other hand, sheds no light on the original, being embarrassingly self-indulgent. At heart, it fails because it does not engage with the characters drawn by Bront\u00eb, being far more interested in the rapacious cyphers who populate the contemporary part of the novel. DM Thomas, once f\u00eated for The White Hotel, bangs on so relentlessly about sex that before long you're desperate to treat him as you would an embarrassing party drunk, and order him a taxi, sharpish. But no matter. Charlotte Bront\u00eb can take whatever DM Thomas chooses to throw at her. Too much of the time, he is firing blanks.",

You can tell that Findley is enjoying life; he radiates contentment, the kind of happiness that comes from knowing you are in exactly the right place, doing exactly what you love most. Canada's leading writer is 70 now, and he's worked hard for this; nine novels, three short-story collections, two volumes of memoir and three plays. </p> <p>His ninth novel, Pilgrim (Faber, \u00a310.99), has just been published here, and he's greatly excited because, despite his importance in the United States and Canada and a raft of honorary degrees and awards (including the prestigious Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres), he hasn't been published in the UK for nearly 15 years and has never been here to promote a book before.</p> <p>We're on the terrace of his hotel in Bloomsbury, and on the next table Bill Whitehead, Findley's partner of more than 30 years, is also contentedly chain-smoking and cradling a glass of wine, looking out over the gardens. 'Sometimes he needs my memory,' Bill confides in a stage whisper; Findley ('Tiff', as he is known to everyone) pretends to be annoyed. Sometimes they finish each other's sentences. They are both neatly dressed, charming, kindly, funny and with a slight whiff of the theatre about them, a vestige of their previous career. They are, in short, lovely; they make you want to spend all day with them, be a part of their world. </p> <p>That Findley should be so little known in this country is extraordinary, when the others of his generation (which he describes without a trace of self-importance as 'the golden age of Canadian literature') are internationally feted: Margaret Atwood, Alice Munroe, Mordecai Richler, Michael Ondaatje. Findley is convinced that he fell from grace with the British literary world because of our fierce loyalty to the royal family. In 1986, his fourth novel, Famous Last Words, which features the Duke and Duchess of Windsor as fictional characters, was published here to surprisingly hostile reviews, though it had been well received by US critics. </p> <p>'I've never read anything so cruel,' he says, looking sad, and you immediately want to beat up anyone who would be mean to him. 'Their attitude was really, \"How dare this upstart colonial insult our royals?\". But the papers were very unkind about the book, so I think publishers were wary of taking me on after that.' </p> <p>Their caution meant that British readers missed out on two of Findley's finest novels, Headhunter and The Pianoman's Daughter. But he is delighted that it is Pilgrim - already a bestseller in Canada, heaped with critical acclaim in the US press and tipped as a likely Booker contender - that marks his return to the British literary arena. </p> <p>Pilgrim is a daring novel, one which broaches hefty and complex questions about the 'big themes' - art, death, consciousness, humanity. It's also impossible to put down, serious and funny with deep resonances and a cast of wonderful characters. Pilgrim is a man who has lived for ever; like the prophet Tiresias, he cannot die and has been both male and female.</p> <p>In 1912, after another fruitless suicide attempt, he is taken to the Burgholzi Clinic in Zurich, where he becomes a patient of an ambitious, unorthodox young doctor named Carl Gustav Jung. Through Pilgrim, Jung begins to understand the collective unconscious; Pilgrim, meanwhile, being prescient, can see the approaching horror of the First World War and in response, sets out on a journey of destruction, obliterating the landmarks of European art which, he feels, can have no place or meaning to a humanity bent on destroying itself. Findley's prose is beautifully poised, his sentences carefully weighed and precise. Each evening, he asks Bill to read aloud the pages he has written that day, wanting to hear their rhythm, feeling that if the tongue trips on the words, the mind will too. </p> <p>Findley's great strength is his feel for dialogue, a talent nurtured during the 15 years he spent working as a professional actor. He had his first acting job at 17, but his break came when he was cast with Alec Guinness and Irene Worth at the inaugural Shakespeare Festival at Stratford, Ontario in 1953. 'For a young actor it was wonderful,' he says, blue eyes shining with pleasure as he remembers. 'Good God, here I was at 22 and I was working with these people - I even had a whole scene with Guinness! Well, he thought very highly of me as a young actor, so he and Tyrone Guthrie put together some money for me to come and study in London.' </p> <p>He trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama and was ambitious in his stage career until, at the age of 32, he wrote a short story in order to win an argument with the actress Ruth Gordon. 'I thought, there's only one way I can win this argument, and that's by being the only voice. So I went home and I wrote a story, which I had never done before, and when she read it she put her arms around me and said, \"Oh, Tiffy, you must give up acting just as fast as you can!\" And I thought, I beg your bloody pardon - I want to be Laurence Olivier, I want to be Alec Guinness, I'm not giving up! But she said, \"Because you are a born writer, and there are so few that we can't afford to lose one.\" Isn't that lovely?' </p> <p>Life hasn't always been so happy for Findley. He cared for his brother who died slowly of alcoholism, and Findley has had his own battles on that front. 'But through therapy, and through Bill, I've managed to solve it. I now drink nothing but wine.' He twinkles, lifting his glass. 'I think you can give up so easily and say, oh, the suffering is beyond me - well, if you didn't have some suffering, how would you ever grow up? And the how the hell would you know how to write? It doesn't mean you provoke it, or wallow in it, but I do believe that you couldn't write if there wasn't an awareness of suffering. It's one of the ingredients of all good writers.' But he does admit that 'if I didn't have a foot truly anchored on the ground, and a man to live with who saves my sanity every day, I don't know why I wouldn't just sink into alcoholism and get out of here.' </p> <p>For now, though, there is a lot to look forward to. His new play, Elizabeth Rex, is about to open in Stratford, Ontario, then he and Bill leave for their house in Provence. 'We're going on a special dispensation,' he says. 'Usually you can't leave Canada for more than six months at a time or you lose your pension and your benefits. But if you're near the end of your life, they let you make a special trip, just once, to stay longer.' </p> <p>It's odd to hear him say that, as if a cloud has suddenly passed over. But he's hard at work on another novel, and there are other ideas, possible titles scribbled on the backs of cigarette packets, other characters waiting to appear. Tiff is still in the sun.</p>",

      "byline": "Mick Imlah",

      "body": "<p><strong>The Complete Poems of William Empson</strong>edited by John Haffenden<br>Allen Lane \u00a330, pp512<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501003673,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> The poet and critic William Empson, who died in 1984, was the newly risen star of Cambridge English in its heyday of the late Twenties, and seemed, with his probing, scientific cast of mind, to exemplify the spirit of the place then. He came to literature via mathematics. In September 1930, at the age of 24, he published Seven Types of Ambiguity, the classic statement of the techniques of close reading championed by his tutor, I.A. Richards. </p> <p>Before this moment of triumph, however, he had been banished from his fellowship at Magdalene, after contraceptives had been discovered among his possessions by a porter; he spent the rest of his life as an itinerant university teacher, mostly in Japan and China, latterly in Sheffield, where his marvellously dedicated editor, John Haffenden, has since inherited his chair. </p> <p>As he had already, before his expulsion, written half the poems he was ever to publish, many commentators, including F.R. Leavis, have characterised Empson's career as a falling away from these brilliant beginnings. He was certainly not prolific. Of this monumental volume's 500 pages, an almost comically small proportion - barely 100 - have poems on them. The rest is annotation.</p> <p>Empson's two collections of verse had as much explicatory prose in them as they had poetry; not, as is said of the notes to The Waste Land, to bring small books up to size, but from a conviction that the writer might be able to explain the whole meaning of his poem. These notes are supplemented here, sometimes repetitively, by information volunteered by the author in letters and interviews, and then again by the panoply of Haffenden's work on the poems; so that this is a complete edition of the poems and an exhaustive companion to them. </p> <p>But should any poems need to be buttressed by so much apparatus? Leavis regretted what he judged to be Empson's 'unprofitable obscurity', and not all the notes in the world could make easy going of a poem like 'Bacchus', Empson's longest exercise in the cryptic mode, impressive and exasperating alike to Peter Porter, who called it 'the most difficult poem in the world'. Empson wanted his poems to be complicated in the way that life is, and since he thought that 'life involves maintaining oneself between contradictions that can't be solved by analysis', it's little wonder if they sometimes seem to close themselves off from the reader. </p> <p>When Empson's verse has been in favour, notably in the early Fifties, it was for qualities that might be summarised as sanity: intelligence, formal assurance, the charm of his eccentric perceptions (a juggler whose apples are rotten, etc); qualities resembling those of the metaphysical poets of the early seventeenth century. Yet Haffenden's labours encourage us now to a different reading of the poems' reserve and obscurity.</p> <p>Empson acknowledged in retrospect that his poems were attempts to objectify and so to control what he called 'neurotic [uncaused] fear'. His sufferings from nervous illness will, no doubt, be detailed in Haffenden's forthcoming biography. Meanwhile, it is evidently no coincidence that he wrote (or preserved) hardly a line of verse after his marriage in 1941, when he was 35. His first poems, so exacting in their allusiveness, are revealed as those of a boy afraid of a girl; the second crop, collected in The Gathering Storm in 1940, are those of a world in fear of war. </p> <p>Empson's poems have always seemed deeply felt at the same time as they are extravagantly imagined or intricately argued. We have his sanction here to categorise them as 'Despair Poetry'; and he excelled at forms like the villanelle, where single lines repeat with numbing or imprisoning effect: 'It is the pain, it is the pain endures', or 'Slowly the poison the whole blood stream fills', or 'The heart of standing is you cannot fly'. A poem called 'This Last Pain' seems to define Empson's motive and method, his setting of wit against terror, his narrow but unique achievement, when it concludes: 'Imagine.../ What could not possibly be there,/ And learn a style from a despair.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Complete Poems of William Empsonedited by John Haffenden Allen Lane \u00a330, pp512 Buy it at BOL The poet and critic William Empson, who died in 1984, was the newly risen star of Cambridge English in its heyday of the late Twenties, and seemed, with his probing, scientific cast of mind, to exemplify the spirit of the place then. He came to literature via mathematics. In September 1930, at the age of 24, he published Seven Types of Ambiguity, the classic statement of the techniques of close reading championed by his tutor, I.A. Richards. Before this moment of triumph, however, he had been banished from his fellowship at Magdalene, after contraceptives had been discovered among his possessions by a porter; he spent the rest of his life as an itinerant university teacher, mostly in Japan and China, latterly in Sheffield, where his marvellously dedicated editor, John Haffenden, has since inherited his chair. As he had already, before his expulsion, written half the poems he was ever to publish, many commentators, including F.R. Leavis, have characterised Empson's career as a falling away from these brilliant beginnings. He was certainly not prolific. Of this monumental volume's 500 pages, an almost comically small proportion - barely 100 - have poems on them. The rest is annotation. Empson's two collections of verse had as much explicatory prose in them as they had poetry; not, as is said of the notes to The Waste Land, to bring small books up to size, but from a conviction that the writer might be able to explain the whole meaning of his poem. These notes are supplemented here, sometimes repetitively, by information volunteered by the author in letters and interviews, and then again by the panoply of Haffenden's work on the poems; so that this is a complete edition of the poems and an exhaustive companion to them. But should any poems need to be buttressed by so much apparatus? Leavis regretted what he judged to be Empson's 'unprofitable obscurity', and not all the notes in the world could make easy going of a poem like 'Bacchus', Empson's longest exercise in the cryptic mode, impressive and exasperating alike to Peter Porter, who called it 'the most difficult poem in the world'. Empson wanted his poems to be complicated in the way that life is, and since he thought that 'life involves maintaining oneself between contradictions that can't be solved by analysis', it's little wonder if they sometimes seem to close themselves off from the reader. When Empson's verse has been in favour, notably in the early Fifties, it was for qualities that might be summarised as sanity: intelligence, formal assurance, the charm of his eccentric perceptions (a juggler whose apples are rotten, etc); qualities resembling those of the metaphysical poets of the early seventeenth century. Yet Haffenden's labours encourage us now to a different reading of the poems' reserve and obscurity. Empson acknowledged in retrospect that his poems were attempts to objectify and so to control what he called 'neurotic [uncaused] fear'. His sufferings from nervous illness will, no doubt, be detailed in Haffenden's forthcoming biography. Meanwhile, it is evidently no coincidence that he wrote (or preserved) hardly a line of verse after his marriage in 1941, when he was 35. His first poems, so exacting in their allusiveness, are revealed as those of a boy afraid of a girl; the second crop, collected in The Gathering Storm in 1940, are those of a world in fear of war. Empson's poems have always seemed deeply felt at the same time as they are extravagantly imagined or intricately argued. We have his sanction here to categorise them as 'Despair Poetry'; and he excelled at forms like the villanelle, where single lines repeat with numbing or imprisoning effect: 'It is the pain, it is the pain endures', or 'Slowly the poison the whole blood stream fills', or 'The heart of standing is you cannot fly'. A poem called 'This Last Pain' seems to define Empson's motive and method, his setting of wit against terror, his narrow but unique achievement, when it concludes: 'Imagine.../ What could not possibly be there,/ And learn a style from a despair.'",

Then, three lengthy fragments of 'life-writing' by Scholes, one on Linnaeus, the eighteenth-century scientific writer and traveller, one on Galton, the nineteenth-century mental researcher, now damned for his views on eugenics, and one on Ibsen. 'A taxonomist, a statistician, a dramatist: students in their own ways of the connectedness of things and people.' Then, a shoebox of Scholes's leavings, including file cards of quotations by or about his three figures. Last, a report of his presumed drowning, with a photograph, not of his face, which Phineas has never seen, but of an empty boat. </p> <p>Phineas's quest takes him from a quiet, solitary existence into a network of emotional and erotic adventures: with two apparently charming gay travel agents in a highly specialised travel agency called Puck's Girdle; with a Swedish pollination ecologist called Fulla Biefeld, encountered at the Linnaean Society, and with Scholes's palely beautiful niece, Vera Alfrage, a radiographer. Gradually, Phineas's attempt to write a clinical account of his biographical pursuit mutates into a passionate autobiography. His changed life, with his two loves, his travels and new interest in nature, begins rather to resemble that of - Elmer Bole. </p> <p>The novel's meditation on the art of biography stacks up whole shoeboxes full of metaphors for biography's attempt to embody the life of another, its negotiation between generalisations and particulars, its remembering of the dismembered.

      "body": "<p>The rich and famous usually create their own financial crises - by wild extravagance or fighting rash libel actions. Disgraced former Tory MP Jonathan Aitken was driven to bankruptcy by the costs of a libel suit, as was Coronation Street star William Roache. The Duchess of York's debts mounted because of an expensive wanderlust that would have shamed Jules Verne. </p> <p>For the rest of us, crises usually have more mundane causes, such as a business failure, accepting too much of the credit thrown at us, or a life-changing event such as redundancy, divorce, the birth of children or the death of a spouse. Bizarrely, education is now a major debt-maker: more and more students leave university owing \u00a315,000 or more. </p> <p>Survival means either repaying your debt, reducing it to manageable proportions or, if all else fails, accepting bankruptcy so that what you owe is eventually discharged. </p> <p>Debt generally is currently rising to levels not seen since the late Eighties. The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (Nacab) dealt with 268,000 consumer debt problems in the six months to last September, 7 per cent more than a year earlier. Researcher Mintel says the country's personal debt total, including mortgages, is \u00a3600 billion - or \u00a310,000 per head of the population. And the number of individual insolvencies last year, 28,806, was the highest since 1994. Sue Edwards, money advice officer at Nacab, says problems are brought to a head by something like a notice of eviction, the imminent arrival of bailiffs, or a house or car being repossessed. 'It takes an awful lot for most people to seek help.' </p> <p>Many try to borrow their way out of debt by simply taking on more loans - and then see their problems escalate. Others fall for offers of debt 'consolidation'. This is not a bad idea in itself, but the new loan must be cheaper than the debt it replaces; and beware of replacing unsecured debt, such as credit card bills, with a loan secured on your house. </p> <p>There is usually no easy answer to a crisis, but the right steps will help you to cope: </p> <p> <strong> Step One </strong> Assess the situation calmly. 'Take a good long, hard look at your finances,' says Edwards. 'Then look at your income and your necessary outgoings, and work out a budget that doesn't include any debts unless they are essential.' </p> <p>That may mean drastic cuts in your spending - from cancelling holidays or removing your children from private schools, to spending less on food and nights out. </p> <p> <strong> Step Two </strong> Prioritise your debts. Most unsecured creditors will not make you bankrupt. Nacab's Edwards says: 'A high-priority creditor is anyone who has a serious sanction against you.' </p> <p>These include your mortgage lender, who can repossess your house, your landlord, who may evict you, or your local authority - failure to pay council tax can lead to prison. The Inland Revenue and Customs &amp; Excise are top priority for self-employed people. They can have your property seized and instigate bankruptcy proceedings. The Child Support Agency can have you jailed for failing to pay maintenance. Utility debts are urgent, too: your water, fuel and telephone can be cut off. </p> <p>Non-priority debts for most people include credit cards, bank overdrafts and loans, store cards and other traders' bills. You may prefer to pay some of these people before the taxman, but it's best to recognise who will compromise and who will not. </p> <p>Hire-purchase payments vary in priority, says Edwards. If your car is essential for work, it may be a disaster to lose it. But if the washing machine goes, you can always use a launderette. </p> <p> <strong> Step Three </strong> Seek advice. There are several reputable sources of help. Apart from citizens advice bureaux, there is National Debtline, and specialists such as the Bankruptcy Advisory Service and the Bankruptcy Association. </p> <p>Solicitors or accountants may also be helpful. Beware of 'ambulance chasers', though. Some firms exploit people in trouble for their own gain. </p> <p>'You need advice from somebody who has no vested interest in the advice they give, and whose charges are low,' says Gill Hankey of the Bankruptcy Advisory Service. </p> <p>An experienced adviser will help you to prioritise your debts; will know your legal rights; may help you to negotiate with creditors; and may point you to any additional sources of support such as state benefits. </p> <p> <strong> Step Four </strong> Talk to your creditors. 'Most will do their best to accommodate you,' says Gill Hankey. 'But if you don't contact them for months, they're likely to lose patience.' </p> <p>Try for a gradual repayment of your debt - for example, monthly payments to Customs &amp; Excise to sort out a VAT bill - or a partial repayment. Unsecured creditors know that if you go bankrupt they will probably get nothing. </p> <p>Edwards says: 'A mortgage lender will expect you to be able to meet your existing monthly repayment, and to repay all arrears over the remaining period of the mortgage. If you are a local authority tenant, the authority may accept as little as \u00a32.60 a week if you are on benefits.' </p> <p>Work out how much income is left after essential living costs and priority debts, then offer the other creditors a pro-rata distribution of your remaining income. For example, if you have \u00a3100 a month left after paying your mortgage and utility bills; and you have other debt repayments of \u00a3300 a month, you should offer each creditor a third of the amount due. </p> <p>This process can be formalised in an Individual Voluntary Agreement. However, IVAs can be expensive to set up, and a high proportion fail, usually because the debtor ends up agreeing to a higher level of repayments than they can realistically meet. </p> <p> <strong> Step Five </strong> Think about whether you have any assets that could be used to help repay your debts. It would make little sense to risk bankruptcy over \u00a330,000 of debt if you have an endowment policy that could be cashed in early for a similar amount. If your creditors refuse to compromise, they could ultimately send in bailiffs, seize your possessions, and auction them. You are likely to get a far better price for valuables if you sell them yourself. </p> <p> <strong> Step Six </strong> If your debts are truly overwhelming, consider making yourself bankrupt. 'Once you are in bankruptcy, your creditors can't pursue you any further, and can't take any further action such as sending round bailiffs,' points out Hankey of the Bankruptcy Advisor Service. </p> <p>As a bankrupt, you are not allowed to hold credit cards or raise credit, but if you were in severe debt, you would have little chance of doing this anyway, she points out. </p> <p>However, bankruptcy can mean the permanent loss of your professional status if you are a solicitor, an accountant or a surveyor. And if you have a personal pension, that money can be seized along with your other assets. </p> <p>John McQueen, founder and chief executive of the Bankruptcy Association, says: 'Whether you opt to go bankrupt should depend to a large extent on whether you are under direct pressure - if you have bailiffs knocking at your door, for example.' </p> <p>Those who have least to lose from bankruptcy are people with few assets or little disposable income. If you are young, espe cially, you may eventually be able to put your bankruptcy behind you and start afresh. </p> <p> <strong> Step seven. </strong> Even in the depths of a crisis, don't take your eye off the ball. 'I've just had a guy come to see me who's 64 years old, and the Official Receiver has told him they are going to sell his house,' says McQueen. 'Five years ago, when he was made bankrupt, the house was in negative equity, and he could have bought it back from the Receiver for \u00a31, but now it has risen in value and he's going to lose it.' </p> <p>Some people eventually pull through simply by taking stock of their situation, talking to creditors, and reordering their lives to reflect their new circumstances. Others go through the pain of bankruptcy, with the knowledge that at the end of three years - or two if the amount owed is less than \u00a320,000 - their debt will be discharged. Within another five years the record of the bankruptcy should be expunged from credit reference agencies' records. </p> <p>Still other people manage to just keep their head above water for years, with no prospect of the cloud of debt lifting. This is arguably the worst course. </p> <p>Hankey says: 'I always like to see a solution to the problem. I had a lady who came to see me who's just 24 years old. She owes \u00a313,000 but only earns \u00a3600 a month, and she had been advised to pay off her debt at \u00a31 a month. I would question the validity of that advice, because this lady will never be free of the debt.' </p> <p> <strong>Victim of 'vindictiveness'</strong></p> <p>John Yate's bankruptcy was triggered by the failure of his business, which was in turn the result of a six-week postal strike in Birmingham during 1998. Yates's company, a sort of mail order version of Ann Summers, had been trading successfully since 1973. He had 25 people on the payroll when the business was brought to a standstill by the postal workers' dispute. </p> <p>Ironically, the Post Office was among the first to withdraw credit, and the business went into receivership with debts estimated by the Official Receiver at \u00a31 million. For Yates, now 53, that spelt much more than the loss of his livelihood; he had signed personal guarantees to a finance company to obtain loans for refinancing company equipment. Now they wanted their money back. </p> <p>'When I signed the guarantees, the agent for the finance company told me: \"Don't worry, they never act on these guarantees\",' says John, who now concedes he was naive. He tried to strike a deal with this creditor, proposing a Company Voluntary Agreement, then an Individual Voluntary Agreement. But, he says, they refused to discuss it, and seemed determined to make him bankrupt, even though that meant they would probably get nothing. 'I just couldn't get over the uncommercial vindictiveness of it,' he says. </p> <p>One of the greatest shocks, he says, was realising how little there was available in the way of help. His bank was unsympathetic, and the only support he found was from his doctor and a couple of suppliers, as well as the Bankruptcy Association. 'But there was no agency that I could go to to broker a deal with creditors.' </p> <p>Yates says he was hit 'really hard' by bankruptcy when it came in January 1999. 'People were shocked when they saw me - my self-esteem disappeared and I really lost the will to live.' He believes that bankruptcy is the lowest status society can bestow on an individual. 'I feel useless; sometimes I feel dirty.' </p> <p>Nearly 18 months into bankruptcy, John is still confused about its implications. The family home was safe: it had always been in his wife's name. He has also found work with the company that bought most of the assets. But he is not sure whether his pension is safe, and it remains to be seen whether creditors will accept his settlement offer. </p> <p>The main lessons he has learnt are not to sign personal guarantees, and not to trust 'the system'. 'I went to business school but I was never taught how easy it is to bankrupt someone. Bankruptcy is the only situation where you don't get a second chance.'</p> <p><strong>Help on way for the honestly unlucky</strong></p> <p>A Government consultation paper published earlier this year has proposed that the laws on bankruptcy be significantly relaxed, as part of a drive towards encouraging entrepreneurial activity in the UK. </p> <p>Introducing the paper, Trade Secretary Stephen Byers said: 'Bankruptcy law currently makes no distinction between those who are honest but unlucky or undercapitalised, and the reckless or fraudulent.' </p> <p>The paper proposes that 'honest' bankrupts be discharged much more quickly - in six months rather than the current norm of three years. It points out that in the UK, the proportion of bankruptcies relating to business failure - 65 per cent - is far higher than in countries such as the US, where more than 90 per cent of bankruptcies involve consumer debt. In the US there is no fixed period before you are discharged: in most cases it takes only three to four months. </p> <p>Another proposal is that those declared bankrupt be entitled to keep a part of the equity in their home, without it being seized by the Official Receiver. In parts of the US, this is called a 'homestead allowance', and the idea is that it would lower the risk of borrowing money for a business, and consequently reduce the widespread problem of under-capitalisation. </p> <p>For those deemed to have acted fraudulently or irresponsibly, however, the Green Paper proposes a harsher regime. The Official Receiver would be able to seek an order which would prolong the restrictions on bankrupts obtaining credit, trading under another name, or directing a company, for a period of up to 15 years. </p> <p><strong>Retired, but still in fear of the last stubborn creditors</strong></p> <p> Financial difficulties began for Gwen Marshall and her husband, Jim, when Gwen lost her job as a secretary at a City bank. It was 1990 and mortgage rates had rocketed; the repayments on their Home Counties bungalow had risen from \u00a3500 to over \u00a31,000, and they had the additional cost of an endowment policy to meet. </p> <p>Gwen found a job, but her pay fell from \u00a316,000 to \u00a39,000, and the couple were soon struggling. 'I was in poor health with arthritis and asthma, so I wasn't up to commuting to London every day,' Gwen explains. 'And local pay was much lower.' </p> <p>By 1993, the Marshalls were three months behind with their repayments; then a repossession letter arrived from their lender. They sold the house themselves, but having borrowed less than \u00a370,000 initially, they found they now owed the mortgage company more than \u00a3110,000. Once they had paid it off, they had exactly \u00a375 left. </p> <p>The council helped them find private accommodation, but in 1994 Gwen was made redundant again, and other creditors were making urgent demands. 'We were getting demanding letters, people knocking on the door threatening to take our things, and even talking to our neighbours,' says Gwen. They went to their local citizen's advice bureau in desperation. Here a financial adviser wrote to the creditors - 15 in all - asking for details of the sums owed. Their debts amounted to \u00a332,000. </p> <p>The CAB helped draw up a financial statement of incomings and outgoings, and an offer was made to repay creditors monthly with no further interest accruing. All 15 accepted. 'We were so happy, because we had never thought there could be a way out,' says Gwen. 'The amounts were not too bad.' </p> <p>The couple continued with their repayments until this year, when Jim retired. He opted to take a lump sum as part of his pension in the hope of a final settlement with creditors. So far, most have accepted, but a handful have declined. Gwen says: 'We're still a bit frightened, but we hope they will come round so we can enjoy our retirement.' </p> <p>She believes the onerous conditions attached to their mortgage made their problems much worse and advises anybody taking a home loan to check the details very carefully. </p> <p>She adds: 'I don't know what would have happened without the citizen's advice bureau. Without them, we'd have been on the streets.' </p> <p>\u0095 Names have been changed</p>",

      "bodyText": "The rich and famous usually create their own financial crises - by wild extravagance or fighting rash libel actions. Disgraced former Tory MP Jonathan Aitken was driven to bankruptcy by the costs of a libel suit, as was Coronation Street star William Roache. The Duchess of York's debts mounted because of an expensive wanderlust that would have shamed Jules Verne. For the rest of us, crises usually have more mundane causes, such as a business failure, accepting too much of the credit thrown at us, or a life-changing event such as redundancy, divorce, the birth of children or the death of a spouse. Bizarrely, education is now a major debt-maker: more and more students leave university owing \u00a315,000 or more. Survival means either repaying your debt, reducing it to manageable proportions or, if all else fails, accepting bankruptcy so that what you owe is eventually discharged. Debt generally is currently rising to levels not seen since the late Eighties. The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (Nacab) dealt with 268,000 consumer debt problems in the six months to last September, 7 per cent more than a year earlier. Researcher Mintel says the country's personal debt total, including mortgages, is \u00a3600 billion - or \u00a310,000 per head of the population. And the number of individual insolvencies last year, 28,806, was the highest since 1994. Sue Edwards, money advice officer at Nacab, says problems are brought to a head by something like a notice of eviction, the imminent arrival of bailiffs, or a house or car being repossessed. 'It takes an awful lot for most people to seek help.' Many try to borrow their way out of debt by simply taking on more loans - and then see their problems escalate. Others fall for offers of debt 'consolidation'. This is not a bad idea in itself, but the new loan must be cheaper than the debt it replaces; and beware of replacing unsecured debt, such as credit card bills, with a loan secured on your house. There is usually no easy answer to a crisis, but the right steps will help you to cope: Step One Assess the situation calmly. 'Take a good long, hard look at your finances,' says Edwards. 'Then look at your income and your necessary outgoings, and work out a budget that doesn't include any debts unless they are essential.' That may mean drastic cuts in your spending - from cancelling holidays or removing your children from private schools, to spending less on food and nights out. Step Two Prioritise your debts. Most unsecured creditors will not make you bankrupt. Nacab's Edwards says: 'A high-priority creditor is anyone who has a serious sanction against you.' These include your mortgage lender, who can repossess your house, your landlord, who may evict you, or your local authority - failure to pay council tax can lead to prison.

The Child Support Agency can have you jailed for failing to pay maintenance. Utility debts are urgent, too: your water, fuel and telephone can be cut off. Non-priority debts for most people include credit cards, bank overdrafts and loans, store cards and other traders' bills. You may prefer to pay some of these people before the taxman, but it's best to recognise who will compromise and who will not. Hire-purchase payments vary in priority, says Edwards. If your car is essential for work, it may be a disaster to lose it. But if the washing machine goes, you can always use a launderette. Step Three Seek advice. There are several reputable sources of help. Apart from citizens advice bureaux, there is National Debtline, and specialists such as the Bankruptcy Advisory Service and the Bankruptcy Association.

      "body": "<p>Pensioners' incomes are likely to be a major issue in the next general election. That is the safest conclusion you can draw from last week's political battles. </p> <p>Conservative leader Will-iam Hague started the debate when he announced plans for an extra weekly increase in the Basic State Pension - of between \u00a35.50 and \u00a310 - for each pensioner or pensioner couple. This payment would start from April next year, if there were an election before then and a Conservative victory. </p> <p>Labour counterclaimed that pensioners would be only a tiny amount better off under these plans - 42p a week for a single pensioner under 75. What is the truth? </p> <p>Most commentators - including the Conservative spokespeople - now accept that there is very little new money in the Tory plans for pensioners. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) calculates that, on average, the 11 million pensioners would get an extra \u00a330 a year each. </p> <p>This is because money for the \u00a32 billion increase would come from stopping benefits pensioners already get - the \u00a310 Christmas bonus, for instance, the \u00a3150 Winter Fuel Payment, the extra 25p-a-week for the over-85s and the free TV licence for the over-75s. The only new money proposed for pensioners is another \u00a3320 million - which would be taken by scrapping the New Deal scheme for lone parents, slashing emergency help for people on Income Support and by denying a newly won right of Winter Fuel Payments to men aged 60 to 64. </p> <p>But there would be winners and losers in the Tory proposals, according to the IFS. 'The people with most to win would be couples who have both built up Basic State Pension rights,' says spokeswoman Sarah Smith. This is because they would both, if under 75, get a \u00a35.50 increase, worth \u00a3572 a year together, and would lose \u00a3170 (their \u00a310 Christmas bonuses and the \u00a3150 Winter Fuel Payment paid per household, not per person).

      "bodyText": "Pensioners' incomes are likely to be a major issue in the next general election. That is the safest conclusion you can draw from last week's political battles. Conservative leader Will-iam Hague started the debate when he announced plans for an extra weekly increase in the Basic State Pension - of between \u00a35.50 and \u00a310 - for each pensioner or pensioner couple. This payment would start from April next year, if there were an election before then and a Conservative victory. Labour counterclaimed that pensioners would be only a tiny amount better off under these plans - 42p a week for a single pensioner under 75. What is the truth? Most commentators - including the Conservative spokespeople - now accept that there is very little new money in the Tory plans for pensioners. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) calculates that, on average, the 11 million pensioners would get an extra \u00a330 a year each. This is because money for the \u00a32 billion increase would come from stopping benefits pensioners already get - the \u00a310 Christmas bonus, for instance, the \u00a3150 Winter Fuel Payment, the extra 25p-a-week for the over-85s and the free TV licence for the over-75s. The only new money proposed for pensioners is another \u00a3320 million - which would be taken by scrapping the New Deal scheme for lone parents, slashing emergency help for people on Income Support and by denying a newly won right of Winter Fuel Payments to men aged 60 to 64. But there would be winners and losers in the Tory proposals, according to the IFS. 'The people with most to win would be couples who have both built up Basic State Pension rights,' says spokeswoman Sarah Smith. This is because they would both, if under 75, get a \u00a35.50 increase, worth \u00a3572 a year together, and would lose \u00a3170 (their \u00a310 Christmas bonuses and the \u00a3150 Winter Fuel Payment paid per household, not per person). They would end up about \u00a34 a week better off each. The Tories are also proposing to raise tax thresholds for pensioners, so that they do not immediately lose some of this gain in tax. Obvious losers are men aged 60 to 64. They have recently won the right to Winter Fuel Payments in a sex equality case with women who officially become pensioners five years earlier than men, at 60. But these men are not yet entitled to the Basic State Pension and would simply lose their \u00a3150 Winter Fuel Payment: they would be about \u00a33 a week worse off.

When he lifts them to remove his glasses and wipe his eyes, they are shaking uncontrollably.</p> <p>David Trimble, Ulster Unionist leader, will never admit it. But he knows the stakes today on so many fronts will never be higher. He says: \"This process is much more robust than many people think, but there is no doubt Saturday is important. I refuse to discuss what happens if we lose, because I know what the headlines will be. I am not going to get into the back-me-or-sack me approach.</p> <p>\"They are grown people in the Ulster Unionist Council. They don't like to be manipulated with emotional blackmail, as the anti-agreement camp will find out. Its literature has been a turn-off.\"</p> <p>It has been a gruelling week. He is near hoarse after a whirlwind round of meetings, with the aim personally to address all 860 delegates attending today's meeting of his party's ruling council.</p> <p>None of the locations were revealed in advance, apparently for fear of tipping off protesters. On at least one night this week his family's unprepossessing home in the Co Down village of Lambeg, which gives its name to the booming drum beloved of Orangemen, has been picketed until the early hours. An aide revealed hardliners were even shining laser guns into the living room of the house, home to Trimble, his wife Daphne, and four young children. Police finally arrived to disperse them.</p> <p>Worst of all, Trimble half jokes, was having to give away the pair of tickets he had secured weeks ago for last Monday's Royal Opera House staging of Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg. Richard Wagner is his favourite, and his only extravagance is a most expensive music system on which to play his huge, eclectic collection.</p> <p>So, instead of five hours and 40 minutes exhilaration and escape, he was addressing party members near Antrim on the merits of the IRA's unprecedented offer to put arms beyond use. He was then off to go head to head on television with his would-be nemesis, Jeffrey Donaldson, the ambitious anti-agreement MP.</p> <p>As he breakfasts this morning he will be pondering whether it might be the last meal of a condemned politician. Three hours or so later, he will have his answer.</p> <p>Lose today and Trimble, 55, can kiss his five-year leadership of the 95-year-old majority party of Unionism goodbye. He has hinted it might come as a relief, a thought that somehow rings hollow.</p> <p>More, though, is at stake: the Ulster Unionists would be split as never before, possibly irrevocably, sparking a potentially regressive realignment; while the two-year-old Good Friday agreement could be considered deceased. What impact that would have on the IRA is anyone's guess.</p> <p><b> Blame</b><br></p> <p>He will be blamed for each consequence. Many Ulster Unionists will blame him for destroying their party, and for disappointing their early faith in him as a hardliner, while republicans will bemoan his lack of leadership, and say he missed an opportunity to move on when the agreement was in its infancy. But win and he will have carried off a triumph against all odds, defeating a back-biting campaign which would have destroyed robust British politicians long ago. He will have lanced several boils, including the intractable decommissioning impasse, and he will have done it, a handful of lieutenants aside, pretty much on his own.</p> <p>He bounds into the office of first minister more than an hour late. He appears in good form and is sporting a red badge, the Legion D'Honneur, which he won with SDLP leader John Hume. Left casually in one corner are his Nobel peace prize medal and certificate.</p> <p>Only one question has left him stumped since he belatedly announced on May 18 that he was supporting, on the back of the IRA's offer, the British and Irish government's proposals for a return to the power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein. What was the best thing devolved government achieved in its 72-day existence?</p> <p>He appears gobsmacked, stares, both amused and confused, and then whisks off his oh-so-trendy glasses, rubs his eyes, and starts to laugh, or, rather, wheeze. This all takes what seems like minutes.</p> <p>His answer, when it eventually comes, seems that of the pernickety lawyer he was before winning the Upper Bann constituency in 1990 to start a new career relatively late. He was 45 and becalmed in academia when he left Queen's University, Belfast, for Westminster.</p> <p><b> Change</b><br></p> <p>Trimble mumbles about foisting off Sinn Fein attempts to win one of the junior ministers posts through forging an alliance with the SDLP, and, warming to the theme, calls it an example of how the centre-ground must seize the initiative. He believes politics will be changed radically in the next decade, and wants to reform the Ulster Unionists and the party's link with the Orange Order to make it a more attractive proposition for Catholics.</p> <p>\"I have enjoyed the meetings with delegates. They have been very civilised and very calm. The decommissioning issue is, of course, uppermost, but people are also focusing on the behaviour of Sinn Fein during the executive. They believe Sinn Fein ministers, in their attitude towards the union flag, didn't quite play it fair.</p> <p>\"As far as democratic politics is concerned, it's perfectly obvious Sinn Fein are not quite house-trained yet. But you don't train them any other way than through democracy.\"</p> <p>He rejects his opponents' charges that he brought the executive down in February because the IRA had failed to begin arms decommissioning and is going back when there has been no change in that.</p> <p>He points out the May 6 initiative, which provides for arms dumps to be inspected, comes direct from the IRA, a crucial distinction to the vagueness arising out of ex-US senator George Mitchell's review last November. It breaks new ground, and it is time to put them to the test.</p> <p>He says he has secured the RUC's name living on in the title deeds of the new ser vice. He believes he has also outmanoeuvred Sinn Fein on the union flag issue.</p> <p>So what is his canvassing telling him? He refuses to say. \"You have to take all that with a huge pinch of salt. But it is clear matters have been stabilising since we went on to the front foot and said we were backing a return to government.\"</p> <p>Just as well. According to some returns, Trimble may have lost had the council met as initially planned last Saturday by as much as 70 to 30. In postponing the meeting, he has been able to say he pushed the government as far as he could on the RUC and flags, while putting distance between his own expressed doubts and the vote.</p> <p>Tonight opera takes centre stage at the Waterfront Hall. It is Verdi's Aida, a tale of jealously, treachery and divided loyalties. It will be hard pushed to match the drama of the matinee.</p> <p><b>A career spent on the brink</b></p> <p><b> September 1995 </b> Surprise choice as DUP leader</p> <p><b> 1996</b> Alienated many Unionists by travelling to the south to meet members of the main parties in the republic</p> <p><b> September 1997 to April 1998</b> Put political career on line when he led party into first direct talks between unionists and republicans for more than 70 years.

An aide revealed hardliners were even shining laser guns into the living room of the house, home to Trimble, his wife Daphne, and four young children. Police finally arrived to disperse them. Worst of all, Trimble half jokes, was having to give away the pair of tickets he had secured weeks ago for last Monday's Royal Opera House staging of Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg. Richard Wagner is his favourite, and his only extravagance is a most expensive music system on which to play his huge, eclectic collection. So, instead of five hours and 40 minutes exhilaration and escape, he was addressing party members near Antrim on the merits of the IRA's unprecedented offer to put arms beyond use. He was then off to go head to head on television with his would-be nemesis, Jeffrey Donaldson, the ambitious anti-agreement MP. As he breakfasts this morning he will be pondering whether it might be the last meal of a condemned politician. Three hours or so later, he will have his answer. Lose today and Trimble, 55, can kiss his five-year leadership of the 95-year-old majority party of Unionism goodbye. He has hinted it might come as a relief, a thought that somehow rings hollow. More, though, is at stake: the Ulster Unionists would be split as never before, possibly irrevocably, sparking a potentially regressive realignment; while the two-year-old Good Friday agreement could be considered deceased. What impact that would have on the IRA is anyone's guess. Blame He will be blamed for each consequence. Many Ulster Unionists will blame him for destroying their party, and for disappointing their early faith in him as a hardliner, while republicans will bemoan his lack of leadership, and say he missed an opportunity to move on when the agreement was in its infancy. But win and he will have carried off a triumph against all odds, defeating a back-biting campaign which would have destroyed robust British politicians long ago. He will have lanced several boils, including the intractable decommissioning impasse, and he will have done it, a handful of lieutenants aside, pretty much on his own. He bounds into the office of first minister more than an hour late. He appears in good form and is sporting a red badge, the Legion D'Honneur, which he won with SDLP leader John Hume. Left casually in one corner are his Nobel peace prize medal and certificate. Only one question has left him stumped since he belatedly announced on May 18 that he was supporting, on the back of the IRA's offer, the British and Irish government's proposals for a return to the power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein. What was the best thing devolved government achieved in its 72-day existence? He appears gobsmacked, stares, both amused and confused, and then whisks off his oh-so-trendy glasses, rubs his eyes, and starts to laugh, or, rather, wheeze. This all takes what seems like minutes. His answer, when it eventually comes, seems that of the pernickety lawyer he was before winning the Upper Bann constituency in 1990 to start a new career relatively late. He was 45 and becalmed in academia when he left Queen's University, Belfast, for Westminster. Change Trimble mumbles about foisting off Sinn Fein attempts to win one of the junior ministers posts through forging an alliance with the SDLP, and, warming to the theme, calls it an example of how the centre-ground must seize the initiative. He believes politics will be changed radically in the next decade, and wants to reform the Ulster Unionists and the party's link with the Orange Order to make it a more attractive proposition for Catholics. \"I have enjoyed the meetings with delegates. They have been very civilised and very calm. The decommissioning issue is, of course, uppermost, but people are also focusing on the behaviour of Sinn Fein during the executive. They believe Sinn Fein ministers, in their attitude towards the union flag, didn't quite play it fair. \"As far as democratic politics is concerned, it's perfectly obvious Sinn Fein are not quite house-trained yet. But you don't train them any other way than through democracy.\" He rejects his opponents' charges that he brought the executive down in February because the IRA had failed to begin arms decommissioning and is going back when there has been no change in that. He points out the May 6 initiative, which provides for arms dumps to be inspected, comes direct from the IRA, a crucial distinction to the vagueness arising out of ex-US senator George Mitchell's review last November. It breaks new ground, and it is time to put them to the test. He says he has secured the RUC's name living on in the title deeds of the new ser vice. He believes he has also outmanoeuvred Sinn Fein on the union flag issue. So what is his canvassing telling him? He refuses to say. \"You have to take all that with a huge pinch of salt. But it is clear matters have been stabilising since we went on to the front foot and said we were backing a return to government.\" Just as well. According to some returns, Trimble may have lost had the council met as initially planned last Saturday by as much as 70 to 30. In postponing the meeting, he has been able to say he pushed the government as far as he could on the RUC and flags, while putting distance between his own expressed doubts and the vote. Tonight opera takes centre stage at the Waterfront Hall. It is Verdi's Aida, a tale of jealously, treachery and divided loyalties. It will be hard pushed to match the drama of the matinee. A career spent on the brink September 1995 Surprise choice as DUP leader 1996 Alienated many Unionists by travelling to the south to meet members of the main parties in the republic September 1997 to April 1998 Put political career on line when he led party into first direct talks between unionists and republicans for more than 70 years. Lost the support of more than half of his parliamentary colleagues during the talks, which led to Good Friday agreement April 18 1998 Trimble's proposal to accept the Good Friday agreement won 72% of the vote in UUP's ruling council May 22 1998 Good Friday agreement won 71% endorsement in referendum - 1% more than Trimble said he needed June 29 1998 Elected first minister designate of the assembly July 15 1999 Assembly meeting to nominate ministers for the executive collapsed after the UUP refused to attend over decommissioning issue November 27 1999 Supports formation of power-sharing executive linked to a commitment from the IRA on decommissioning February 2000 Threatens to withdraw from power-sharing executive, leading to its suspension March 2000 Survives challenge to his leadership from Martin Smyth, with 56.7% of the vote",

But he wants to assure everyone that he is not ready to be fitted for his pipe and slippers yet. </p> <p>There have been more frightening bowlers than this, even from Jamaica. Michael Holding was faster and more penetrating. And the rather chilling Roy Gilchrist was sent home from a tour of India for bowling beamers. </p> <p>But no fast bowler, from Jamaica or anywhere else, has matched Walsh's remarkable fitness and consistency over such a length of time. He first played test cricket in Australia in 1984-85. </p> <p>The most successful bowler in test history will be 38 this year and, as the West Indians prepare to fly in to Gatwick on Wednesday, England's batsmen are desperately looking for signs that anno domini has done its worst. </p> <p>They may be disappointed. Having recently broken Kapil Dev's record of 434 test wickets \"Cuddy's\" large brown eyes are now set on 500. \"I've never played in a losing series against England, and I've been playing them for 15 years,\" he says. \"I still look after myself, I'm still able to compete.\" </p> <p>This will be his last tour of England, possibly his last anywhere. \"I think 500 wickets is a possibility but I will need luck, consistency and a few more test matches. </p> <p>\"I plan to reassess my body and my mind at the end of this tour. But this could certainly be my last tour, particularly if the new string of youngsters come through and does well.\" </p> <p>Since the bad days of the 80s England have been competitive in their five most recent series against West Indies. The scores, England first, have been: 1-2, 2-2, 1-3, 2-2 and 1-3. </p> <p>\"England have had us on the ropes recently but we have always been able to find something extra to beat them, even if we don't seem to win 4-0 and 5-0 these days. </p> <p>\"Because we haven't toured that well in recent years some people are saying we might struggle. But in the past, whenever the West Indies have been down, they have always rebounded. </p> <p>\"We have always come back with a vengeance. And since our disappointing tour of New Zealand we have played well. Both England and ourselves will be determined to prove that we are not bottom of the barrel. </p> <p>\"Brian Lara will be with us and that makes a huge difference. When I spoke to him in Trinidad I told him to relax and get ready for this tour, because it's no good him coming along if his mind is somewhere else. </p> <p>\"England is home from home for so many of us. And under Jimmy Adams we have beaten Zimbabwe 2-0 and feel there is some confidence coming back. The great thing about Jimmy is that he is not afraid to ask advice. He is always seeking more information.\" </p> <p>We all thought we had said goodbye to Courtney and Curtly when they toured England in 1995. \"Curtly Ambrose is still a silent assassin. He's got this 'Don't get close to me' expression but he's a very close friend and deep down he's a very good team man. </p> <p>\"When we were in England last he waved goodbye at the Oval. He did so again in Australia but he's still around. As the younger players come through, we will go but I don't think it's a very good thing that we should go at the same time.\" </p> <p>But, as he looks forward to his fourth test tour of England, there is a niggling bitterness in the Walsh pysche. It concerns his unhappy split with Gloucestershire, for whom he played between 1984 and 1998 and whose progress in tomorrow's Benson &amp; Hedges Cup semi-final against Lancashire he will follow closely. </p> <p>Walsh was one of the most successful of all overseas signings. But the parting was not amicable and the resentment festers. </p> <p>\"I think I deserved more than a phone call after all that I had done. They tried to blame me but the people there know the truth. </p> <p>\"I'm still close to Mark Alleyne and the rest of the players,\" he says. \"But when I go to Bristol now I go to the far side of the ground. I don't go near the committee room or the executive area. </p> <p>\"I'm not one of those people who can put on a smile and shake hands when I don't mean it. Mark is always telling me to come over but I just wouldn't feel comfortable over there. It's very sad after such a long time. I made a lot of friends at Gloucestershire and it could have been a much better end.\" </p> <p>His last hurrah for the county was a memorable one. He took 106 wickets in the summer of 1998, more than any other bowler since the County Championship was reduced to 17 matches in 1993. In 1998 Gloucestershire won as many matches, 11, as the champions Leicestershire, and finished a close-up fourth. </p> <p>\"When they offered me a [new] two-year contract it was on the basis that I would not be available for the World Cup. Then, in South Africa, I heard that the offer had been withdrawn. From that day to this no one in authority at the club has thought to speak to me personally. It's as though a huge and happy part of my life suddenly doesn't exist any more.\" </p> <p>When it is all over, Walsh will feel relieved. His tired body must go on and on because, once he stops, he will stop for good. </p> <p>And then he will relax over dominoes down at his Melbourne club in Jamaica, where Holding also played and where his mother still serves up stewed peas. In his young club days he really wanted to be a leg-spinner, a fact batsmen today receive with a wry smile. </p>",

The scores, England first, have been: 1-2, 2-2, 1-3, 2-2 and 1-3. \"England have had us on the ropes recently but we have always been able to find something extra to beat them, even if we don't seem to win 4-0 and 5-0 these days. \"Because we haven't toured that well in recent years some people are saying we might struggle. But in the past, whenever the West Indies have been down, they have always rebounded. \"We have always come back with a vengeance. And since our disappointing tour of New Zealand we have played well. Both England and ourselves will be determined to prove that we are not bottom of the barrel. \"Brian Lara will be with us and that makes a huge difference. When I spoke to him in Trinidad I told him to relax and get ready for this tour, because it's no good him coming along if his mind is somewhere else. \"England is home from home for so many of us. And under Jimmy Adams we have beaten Zimbabwe 2-0 and feel there is some confidence coming back. The great thing about Jimmy is that he is not afraid to ask advice. He is always seeking more information.\" We all thought we had said goodbye to Courtney and Curtly when they toured England in 1995. \"Curtly Ambrose is still a silent assassin. He's got this 'Don't get close to me' expression but he's a very close friend and deep down he's a very good team man. \"When we were in England last he waved goodbye at the Oval. He did so again in Australia but he's still around. As the younger players come through, we will go but I don't think it's a very good thing that we should go at the same time.\" But, as he looks forward to his fourth test tour of England, there is a niggling bitterness in the Walsh pysche. It concerns his unhappy split with Gloucestershire, for whom he played between 1984 and 1998 and whose progress in tomorrow's Benson &amp; Hedges Cup semi-final against Lancashire he will follow closely. Walsh was one of the most successful of all overseas signings. But the parting was not amicable and the resentment festers. \"I think I deserved more than a phone call after all that I had done. They tried to blame me but the people there know the truth. \"I'm still close to Mark Alleyne and the rest of the players,\" he says. \"But when I go to Bristol now I go to the far side of the ground. I don't go near the committee room or the executive area. \"I'm not one of those people who can put on a smile and shake hands when I don't mean it. Mark is always telling me to come over but I just wouldn't feel comfortable over there. It's very sad after such a long time. I made a lot of friends at Gloucestershire and it could have been a much better end.\" His last hurrah for the county was a memorable one. He took 106 wickets in the summer of 1998, more than any other bowler since the County Championship was reduced to 17 matches in 1993. In 1998 Gloucestershire won as many matches, 11, as the champions Leicestershire, and finished a close-up fourth. \"When they offered me a [new] two-year contract it was on the basis that I would not be available for the World Cup. Then, in South Africa, I heard that the offer had been withdrawn. From that day to this no one in authority at the club has thought to speak to me personally. It's as though a huge and happy part of my life suddenly doesn't exist any more.\" When it is all over, Walsh will feel relieved. His tired body must go on and on because, once he stops, he will stop for good. And then he will relax over dominoes down at his Melbourne club in Jamaica, where Holding also played and where his mother still serves up stewed peas. In his young club days he really wanted to be a leg-spinner, a fact batsmen today receive with a wry smile.",

In the last 10 feet or so, however (and only the close-up in super-slow motion shows it) the ball changed direction as if by beacon and struck Croft's pad shin-high in front of middle stump. </p> <p>It was sleight of hand, utterly mesmeric and as such far too quick for the umpire. It deserved all 10 wickets at once and did not even get one. </p> <p>We'd even named our first labrador Wasim (the next was Zinzan but that is another story) and the previous summer, during Lancashire's match with Sussex at Lytham, Waz met Waz and the two posed together for posterity by the pavilion. The photograph is up there on a chest of drawers in our living room. Oh and my wife fancies him rotten. Need I go on about his standing in our family? </p> <p>Aside from the match-fixing allegations, Waz's wonderful career has often courted controversy: the ball-tampering saga, for example, which was never concluded satisfactorily (and which failed anyway to explain how Waz could do things with these scuffed up Hush Puppy balls that others could only dream about), and the beamer that he fizzed at Chris Adams in a Lord's final, precipitating a dining-room altercation during an interval. </p> <p>There was the odd injury too which sometimes appeared just a little too convenient. Once, on a previous occasion when Lancashire were in Lytham, this time playing Kent, he left the field during the afternoon complaining of a severe stomach ailment. A doctor was summoned - my mother-in-law, as it happened, who was a general practitioner in the town - who, after examining him, apparently told him that she certainly was not going to certify him unfit and to get back out there. Waz, it emerged, was itching to get to London (by helicopter, if memory serves) for a Pakistan team-mate's benefit match. He didn't make it. </p> <p>But this is something different, for Waz is now a man tainted with the smell of scandal. The International Cricket Council may seek further punishment and Channel 4, which has him contracted to commentate on England's forthcoming series against West Indies, may yet dump him, although it is holding fire to see what emerges. </p> <p>And so probably ought the Selveys. We want him to say it ain't so... but the dog has already gone in any case and I'm steeling myself for the day when the picture has to follow. Might even buy a rabbit for the kids and call it Mullally. And if Waz really is as guilty as sin then let the ignominy of that be a lesson to him.</p>",

From around the wicket the ball, a low full toss, was angling way down the leg side, swinging down there even, and Croft shaped to play a legitimate leg glance. In the last 10 feet or so, however (and only the close-up in super-slow motion shows it) the ball changed direction as if by beacon and struck Croft's pad shin-high in front of middle stump. It was sleight of hand, utterly mesmeric and as such far too quick for the umpire. It deserved all 10 wickets at once and did not even get one. We'd even named our first labrador Wasim (the next was Zinzan but that is another story) and the previous summer, during Lancashire's match with Sussex at Lytham, Waz met Waz and the two posed together for posterity by the pavilion. The photograph is up there on a chest of drawers in our living room. Oh and my wife fancies him rotten. Need I go on about his standing in our family? Aside from the match-fixing allegations, Waz's wonderful career has often courted controversy: the ball-tampering saga, for example, which was never concluded satisfactorily (and which failed anyway to explain how Waz could do things with these scuffed up Hush Puppy balls that others could only dream about), and the beamer that he fizzed at Chris Adams in a Lord's final, precipitating a dining-room altercation during an interval. There was the odd injury too which sometimes appeared just a little too convenient. Once, on a previous occasion when Lancashire were in Lytham, this time playing Kent, he left the field during the afternoon complaining of a severe stomach ailment. A doctor was summoned - my mother-in-law, as it happened, who was a general practitioner in the town - who, after examining him, apparently told him that she certainly was not going to certify him unfit and to get back out there. Waz, it emerged, was itching to get to London (by helicopter, if memory serves) for a Pakistan team-mate's benefit match. He didn't make it. But this is something different, for Waz is now a man tainted with the smell of scandal. The International Cricket Council may seek further punishment and Channel 4, which has him contracted to commentate on England's forthcoming series against West Indies, may yet dump him, although it is holding fire to see what emerges. And so probably ought the Selveys. We want him to say it ain't so... but the dog has already gone in any case and I'm steeling myself for the day when the picture has to follow. Might even buy a rabbit for the kids and call it Mullally. And if Waz really is as guilty as sin then let the ignominy of that be a lesson to him.",

When Keegan brings back Tony Adams, who is resting a slight back injury, there will be nine for the opening match against Portugal in Eindhoven a fortnight on Monday. </p> <p>The exceptions today are Dennis Wise, who will almost certainly have given way to Steve McManaman by the time England face Portugal, and Phil Neville, who has appeared in every one of Keegan's matches so far.

It is not totally new, most of these players started in the play-off games against Scotland, but it is another opportunity to look at it.\" </p> <p>Against Brazil England will use the 4-4-2 formation largely abandoned by Hoddle, who preferred 3-5-2 with wing-backs. Though Keegan is not fully committed to any one system and could bring Gareth Southgate or Martin Keown into a back three, his limited options at full-back, especially on the left, may well see England sticking with the format that, under Terry Venables, took them to the semi-finals of the last European Championship. </p> <p>For England today's encounter with Rivaldo, Cafu, Aldair and the rest will be more a matter for revision than experiment. Keegan will want to see if Paul Ince can still be the midfield force he was in Euro 96 and France 98, if David Beckham can bring the additional qualities to his game that the England coach knows he has and if the attacking partnership of Alan Shearer and Michael Owen can recapture the initial impact that stunned the Argentine defence in St Etienne. </p> <p>In some ways, largely because of niggling injuries, the Brazil game will be a lost opportunity for the England coach. He really needed confirmation of Emile Heskey's ability to complement Shearer up front after the promise the partnership showed against Argentina in February.

Andy Cole reported fit yesterday after taking his bruised toe to a specialist but, unless Robbie Fowler fails to get fit, the Manchester United striker's chance of making Keegan's squad of 22 may already have gone. </p> <p>England are not short of strikers and for the moment Keegan will be seeking the best partner for Shearer while hoping that his retiring captain's presence in the team does not become an issue. Certainly the combination of Shearer and Owen has so far not lived up to its spectacular beginning in St Etienne. Since then the pair have between them scored only three times in the seven international matches they have started together. From what he said yesterday Shearer is plainly leaning towards Heskey. </p> <p>\"I thought the partnership worked well against Argentina in February,\" Shearer said. \"When Emile went down the channels he got past people and caused them problems. He also had a big, strong, physical presence about him and they did not like that. That night looked very promising for him and it is unfortunate he cannot play against Brazil.\" </p> <p>Shearer was more guarded about being reunited with Owen. \"At times the partnership has looked very good but at others not so good,\" he said. \"We've worked on things over the last couple of days. We both like scoring goals but maybe a small problem has been that we both want to be in the box and in the same place. </p> <p>\"Hopefully we can sort that out. There's no harm in us both wanting to score, that is a great knack to have, but we have to help take the weight off each other, ie by running into channels. There is not many better than Michael when he gets the ball at his feet and runs against defenders. He showed that against Argentina in the last World Cup. If he gets the ball a little short I'm sure he will cause problems. But each of us has the instinct to hang on a defender's shoulder and I think we will have to rectify that.\" </p> <p>The build-up to today's match has become dominated by images of Steve McManaman as the player most likely to inspire England in Euro 2000. He, however, will not be joining Keegan until tomorrow night after Real Madrid's celebrations over Wednesday's European Cup final triumph in Paris, in which McManaman played a significant part. </p> <p>No doubt attention will still be on the former Liverpool player in the Ukraine game but for now the England form of David Beckham will come under closer scrutiny. \"He can get more involved in games and we have to be sure we give him enough service. We can't ask him to be influential when we play like we did against Scotland and he spends so much time chasing people back. If we can get him doing the things he is good at he will be a massive, massive plus for us. We have to demand more of him. And he has to look at it himself.\" </p> <p>It all comes back to basics. If England can play the ball more constructively from defence and not needlessly give it away the creative talents of Beckham, McManaman and Paul Scholes will be more likely to prosper. Passing is where Keegan's team need to improve most and a game with Brazil, who have lost only three times to England in 19 meetings, is not a bad place to start. </p>",

      "body": "<p>The roller-coaster ride is almost over. Jim Leighton's colourful career between the sticks will finally end after today's Scottish Cup final against Rangers at Hampden Park. Earlier this week the 41-year-old Aberdeen and former Scotland keeper decided to hang up his gloves and become the club's first full-time goalkeeping coach. </p> <p>\"I had mulled over retirement for a while and decided this would be the ideal time. Mind you,\" he adds, \"I could have been forgiven had I taken the decision during the course of the season. To say it has been turbulent would be an understatement.\" </p> <p>It is appropriate that Scotland's national stadium will be the venue for Leighton's final game. Next to his club's Pittodrie ground, where he has spent 16 years in all, it has been his most regular haunt for most of his career. </p> <p>Those who thought that his initial return to Dundee and then Hibernian after an unhappy time at Manchester United heralded the demise of his career were wrong. He confounded everyone by re-establishing himself in the Scotland team. </p> <p>Yet for someone who made 91 appearances for Scotland - second only to Kenny Dalglish - Leighton has been bewildered by Aberdeen's ventures this season. From being one of the best teams in Europe, and far and away the best in Scotland, during the bulk of the 1980s under Alex Ferguson's managership, their deterioration has been witnessed at first hand by Leighton. He, after all, has had to collect the ball from the back of the net 83 times this season in the league. </p> <p>That is a record for the club, who finished bottom with 33 points - 57 behind today's championship-winning opponents. It was the worst defensive record of any senior team in Britain and, lucky that the Premier League is expanding by two clubs next season, they avoided possible relegation via play-offs with two First Division sides only when it was deemed that the ground of one of them, Falkirk, who finished third, did not meet Premier League standards. </p> <p>On the face of it Aberdeen, would be better off facing Rothwell Town from the Dr Martens Premier or Winsford from the Unibond Premier, teams who conceded 85 and 119 goals respectively. Leighton smiles at the suggestion. </p> <p>\"I know only too well how bad we have been,\" he says. \"The decline probably began in the early 90s and reached its nadir this season. </p> <p>\"What has made it more absurd is that we have reached the finals of the League Cup and Scottish Cup and are guaranteed a place in Europe next season irrespective of the outcome against Rangers.\" </p> <p>Leighton has taken small comfort from this. \"I'm a realist. Our ventures in the cup competitions have only papered over the cracks. Had we played in the cups as badly as we did in our earlier league matches we wouldn't have reached the final.\" </p> <p>But though he can understand the logic behind the bookmakers offering odds of 11-2 against Aberdeen - the longest ever for a finalist - and 4-11 for a Rangers victory, he honestly believes he can collect a fifth winner's medal. </p> <p>\"While for the most part we have been awful there have been matches in which everything gelled and we looked more like champions than a side propping up the table,\" he said. \"Morale is better, especially after winning our last two matches.\" </p> <p>Leighton's morale certainly is. The 2-0 win over Dundee last Sunday gave him his first league shut-out of the season - a far cry from the Ferguson days when he had 22 clean sheets in one season in which he conceded only 17 goals. </p> <p>\"I know it is a cliche to say that we have everything to gain and nothing to lose but that really is the situation. If ever a club was under pressure it is Rangers. After all, one of their most expensive players probably cost more than our entire staff.\" </p> <p>For obvious reasons Leighton is looking forward to this match more than anyone. Along with the centre-half and captain Derek Whyte, who won two Scottish Cup medals with Celtic, he has been using his vast experience to help the younger Aberdeen players during the week's preparation. </p> <p>\"They are really up for this one,\" he says. \"I just hope they have a real go. This is the best Rangers team I can recall and it would be a long afternoon for me if we were to sit back and hope to catch them on the break. </p> <p>\"It's there to be won and we did, after all, beat them in the quarter-finals of the League Cup. I'm not normally an emotional person but I think I will be shedding a few tears at the end of the match. Hopefully they will be tears of joy.\"</p>",

Yet even as Kevin Keegan gets close to sorting out the probables from the improbables before announcing his squad for Euro 2000, the anvil-shaped cloud that has loomed on the horizon ever since the draw was made grows darker still. </p> <p>Three weeks from now England will meet Germany in the tiny, steep-sided Stade Communal in Charleroi amid fears that this is another tragedy waiting to happen. Such sentiments are not alarmist; the ingredients for a disaster are already there. </p> <p>The ground holds only 30,000 and at least three times that number of English and German supporters want to see the game, so a lot will arrive without tickets. </p> <p>The seating is rudimentary: backless plastic perches which invite spectators to stand up, as many will, increasing the danger of an avalanche of bodies should someone fall. And since the ground has perimeter fences the pitch will not offer a ready route to safety, a situation unthinkable in England since Hillsborough. </p> <p>The stadium is set amid a maze of narrow streets which would make it difficult for the emergency services to reach the ground quickly and impede the efforts of the police to keep order should trouble break out. </p> <p>The possibility of crowd trouble has hardly been diminished by Belgian refusals to impose an alcohol ban on match days. True, the mayor of Charleroi has ordered bars near the stadium to be closed but beer will be available in other parts of this small town. </p> <p>Already Belgian politicians have expressed misgivings about playing the England-Germany match in Charleroi. This week members of the country's interior affairs committee visited the Stade Communal and immediately expressed fears about the precipitous tiers of seats which, according to some reports, would necessitate mountain-rescue teams being mobilised to remove injured spectators. One member admitted he had \"the feeling of being in an extremely dangerous position\". </p> <p>The case for switching this game to a larger ground, even at such a late stage, would appear unanswerable. The King Baudouin stadium in Brussels, which holds 50,000 in safety and comfort, is barely half an hour away. </p> <p>Uefa, however, remains adamant that the match will go on in Charleroi come what may. And to judge from the comments of its chief executive Gerhard Aigner this week on the trouble that broke out in Copenhagen before the Uefa Cup final between Arsenal and Galatasaray, nothing will prompt a change of heart. </p> <p>Aigner continues to propound the now defunct view that football authorites cannot be held responsible for what happens outside grounds. In Copenhagen, he said, there was no trouble at the Parken stadium, as indeed there was not. What went on in the city centre a few hours before \"had nothing to do with our sport\". </p> <p>This is a dangerously complacent attitude. Should violence break out in Charleroi it could raise tensions inside the stadium before kick-off. </p> <p>Then again, there might be no trouble inside the ground. The behaviour of football crowds is difficult to predict. The street rioting in Marseille that preceded England's opening game against Tunisia in the 1998 World Cup was not reflected in the mood of the English fans inside the Stade Velodrome. </p> <p>The point about Charleroi is that any crowd problems would be exacerbated by the stadium's limitations. Before the 1985 European Cup final in Brussels Uefa's cursory inspection of the delapidated venue did not take into account what might happen in the event of a disturbance. Then Heysel happened and the ground was rebuilt as the King Baudouin Stadium, to which Uefa should now take the England-Germany game. </p> <p>It will not, of course, so one trusts that widespread predictions of the match becoming football's armageddon turn out to be a case of reality contradicting hype. Aigner touched a raw nerve when he declared that parts of the media were responsible for what happened in Copenhagen; although no reporter or cameraman could be blamed for starting the trouble, the way it was represented gave an exaggerated impression of what actually occurred. </p> <p>Overnight press pictures of an Arsenal supporter bleeding from a stab wound followed by 24 hours of repeated TV pictures showing rampaging mobs and tear gas suggested that the Danish capital had suffered two days of violence. In fact the trouble lasted no more than 45 minutes and the worst scenes little more than 15. </p> <p>Television has a particular responsibility here. A close-up shot of half a dozen football fans pushing and shouting can leave viewers believing that a full-scale riot has broken out. In its keenness to get good pictures TV can be as guilty of sensationalism as the most strident tabloid. </p> <p>It is to be hoped that on June 17 an outbreak of peace in Charleroi finds us all guilty of being at least a little sensationalist in advance. </p>",

Three weeks from now England will meet Germany in the tiny, steep-sided Stade Communal in Charleroi amid fears that this is another tragedy waiting to happen. Such sentiments are not alarmist; the ingredients for a disaster are already there. The ground holds only 30,000 and at least three times that number of English and German supporters want to see the game, so a lot will arrive without tickets. The seating is rudimentary: backless plastic perches which invite spectators to stand up, as many will, increasing the danger of an avalanche of bodies should someone fall. And since the ground has perimeter fences the pitch will not offer a ready route to safety, a situation unthinkable in England since Hillsborough. The stadium is set amid a maze of narrow streets which would make it difficult for the emergency services to reach the ground quickly and impede the efforts of the police to keep order should trouble break out. The possibility of crowd trouble has hardly been diminished by Belgian refusals to impose an alcohol ban on match days. True, the mayor of Charleroi has ordered bars near the stadium to be closed but beer will be available in other parts of this small town. Already Belgian politicians have expressed misgivings about playing the England-Germany match in Charleroi. This week members of the country's interior affairs committee visited the Stade Communal and immediately expressed fears about the precipitous tiers of seats which, according to some reports, would necessitate mountain-rescue teams being mobilised to remove injured spectators. One member admitted he had \"the feeling of being in an extremely dangerous position\". The case for switching this game to a larger ground, even at such a late stage, would appear unanswerable. The King Baudouin stadium in Brussels, which holds 50,000 in safety and comfort, is barely half an hour away. Uefa, however, remains adamant that the match will go on in Charleroi come what may. And to judge from the comments of its chief executive Gerhard Aigner this week on the trouble that broke out in Copenhagen before the Uefa Cup final between Arsenal and Galatasaray, nothing will prompt a change of heart. Aigner continues to propound the now defunct view that football authorites cannot be held responsible for what happens outside grounds. In Copenhagen, he said, there was no trouble at the Parken stadium, as indeed there was not. What went on in the city centre a few hours before \"had nothing to do with our sport\". This is a dangerously complacent attitude. Should violence break out in Charleroi it could raise tensions inside the stadium before kick-off. Then again, there might be no trouble inside the ground. The behaviour of football crowds is difficult to predict. The street rioting in Marseille that preceded England's opening game against Tunisia in the 1998 World Cup was not reflected in the mood of the English fans inside the Stade Velodrome. The point about Charleroi is that any crowd problems would be exacerbated by the stadium's limitations. Before the 1985 European Cup final in Brussels Uefa's cursory inspection of the delapidated venue did not take into account what might happen in the event of a disturbance. Then Heysel happened and the ground was rebuilt as the King Baudouin Stadium, to which Uefa should now take the England-Germany game. It will not, of course, so one trusts that widespread predictions of the match becoming football's armageddon turn out to be a case of reality contradicting hype. Aigner touched a raw nerve when he declared that parts of the media were responsible for what happened in Copenhagen; although no reporter or cameraman could be blamed for starting the trouble, the way it was represented gave an exaggerated impression of what actually occurred. Overnight press pictures of an Arsenal supporter bleeding from a stab wound followed by 24 hours of repeated TV pictures showing rampaging mobs and tear gas suggested that the Danish capital had suffered two days of violence. In fact the trouble lasted no more than 45 minutes and the worst scenes little more than 15. Television has a particular responsibility here. A close-up shot of half a dozen football fans pushing and shouting can leave viewers believing that a full-scale riot has broken out. In its keenness to get good pictures TV can be as guilty of sensationalism as the most strident tabloid. It is to be hoped that on June 17 an outbreak of peace in Charleroi finds us all guilty of being at least a little sensationalist in advance.",

      "body": "<p>Sorry to add to the slush pile of recent stuff about footballers and babies, but there's just one more image that might be worth sharing. It goes back five weeks, to the night Manchester United's hopes of retaining the European Cup were ended by Real Madrid at Old Trafford. </p> <p>An hour and a half after the end of the match, there was hardly anyone left in the stadium. A few stewards were checking the grandstands. The last television crews were moving their equipment out. In the press box, a couple of journalists were wearily packing up their laptops. Out of the players' tunnel, in the south-west corner, came three figures: the Beckham family. </p> <p>Down the touchline they strolled. No security men, no courtiers, no photographers. Posh, presumably to preserve her Manolo heels, kept to the track. David, wearing his grey club suit, lifted one-year-old Brooklyn by the hands and carried him on to the pitch, encouraging the infant to toddle across the grass. You could see the smiles from 200 feet away. After a couple of minutes they disappeared through a gate at the south-east corner, on their way to the players' car park, where David had left one of his cars. The Ferrari, perhaps, or the TVR, or the Lincoln, or the Mercedes. </p> <p>But for that minute or two, questions of wealth and conspicuous consumption didn't intrude at all. The nice shoes and the expensive suit and the flash car were beside the point. Kidnap attempts and bullets in the post seemed a long way away. The appeal of the moment resided in its banality. The point was the lack of self-consciousness, the ability when unobserved to behave just like normal people. </p> <p>Two hours earlier, David Beckham had done something not normal at all. Raul had just scored his second goal, Madrid's third, and United's fate was clear. What he did next said a lot about his character and his talent. </p> <p>This is a player who, whatever his technical virtues, is popularly supposed to be incapable of beating a man with the ball, a flaw which, in some eyes, denies him a claim to greatness. But when he took a short pass from Paul Scholes just outside the penalty area, Beckham shattered the myth. Faced by a Madrid defence good enough to have shut out Valencia's raiders in Paris this week, he put his head down and took them on. A player believed to have no pace weaved past one opponent from a standing start, past another, and past a third, all in the space of 10 yards, as if in a single swaying movement. And then, without breaking stride, he smashed a right-foot drive across Iker Casillas and into the roof of the net. </p> <p>It was anything but a typical Beckham goal. Perhaps its special nature was born out of anger and frustration, out of the knowledge that he and his team were about to lose their precious crown. Perhaps something in him, some self-denying ordinance rooted in an ingrained desire to put the interests of the team first, was momentarily liberated by that knowledge. Had it occurred in happier circumstances, they would still be showing it on television. As it was, it changed nothing. Except, perhaps, the perception of David Beckham's talent. </p> <p>\"He's a fantastic player, a very special and respected player,\" Rivaldo said yesterday, looking ahead to this afternoon's match at Wembley. \"His crosses are always dangerous.\" That's the conventional analysis, and it pays tribute to the way in which, thanks to some special alignment of the bones of ankle and foot, Beckham can whip the ball in from the right wing with an unprecedented degree of late curl and dip. Brazil's left-back - Silvinho of Arsenal - will be expecting a busy afternoon, with Beckham supported by Gary Neville, his club colleague, on England's right flank. </p> <p>\"I think David Beckham can have a bigger influence on the England set-up than he's had already,\" Kevin Keegan said yesterday. \"There's much more in him, and we've got to find a better way of getting it out. We have to demand more of him.\" It sounded promising, although he also talked about the value of Beckham's crosses. And that's the way England will probably operate today, using him as a conventional winger. </p> <p>But if he can score a goal like the one he registered against Real, which had nothing to do with his specialised ability to cross the ball, he can do practically anything. He could even find a way to use the example of Steve McManaman's display in Paris on Wednesday night to prove that, in the right setting and with the right colleagues around him, a player does not need to abandon his gift for wing play in order to exploit his vision of the game from the central areas. The time to do this is during the next five weeks, when Euro 2000 will provide him with the opportunity to measure his development since France 98, when he scored his first - and so far only - international goal with a wonderful free-kick against Colombia but then in the next game responded to Diego Simeone's trivial provocation and found himself being burned in effigy in his own country and forced to listen to obscene chants aimed at his wife. </p> <p>This week, two years and half a lifetime later, the silver Ferrari could be seen parked outside the Buckinghamshire hotel where England are preparing for their campaign, lined up amid the Jags and the Mercs and the Porsches of his team-mates.

That's what he is there to do. But while the squad is gathered round listening to Derek Fazackerley, the assistant coach, Beckham is loitering on the fringe and waiting for the moment when he can play a little game with David Seaman. It goes like this: Beckham chips the ball hard over Seaman's head while the goalkeeper throws up a second ball to try to divert it; a little test of accuracy and reflexes. When the players are lying on the grass as Keegan talks to them, Beckham is sitting on a ball, as if he can't bear to be without it.

      "bodyText": "Sorry to add to the slush pile of recent stuff about footballers and babies, but there's just one more image that might be worth sharing. It goes back five weeks, to the night Manchester United's hopes of retaining the European Cup were ended by Real Madrid at Old Trafford. An hour and a half after the end of the match, there was hardly anyone left in the stadium. A few stewards were checking the grandstands. The last television crews were moving their equipment out. In the press box, a couple of journalists were wearily packing up their laptops. Out of the players' tunnel, in the south-west corner, came three figures: the Beckham family. Down the touchline they strolled. No security men, no courtiers, no photographers. Posh, presumably to preserve her Manolo heels, kept to the track. David, wearing his grey club suit, lifted one-year-old Brooklyn by the hands and carried him on to the pitch, encouraging the infant to toddle across the grass. You could see the smiles from 200 feet away. After a couple of minutes they disappeared through a gate at the south-east corner, on their way to the players' car park, where David had left one of his cars. The Ferrari, perhaps, or the TVR, or the Lincoln, or the Mercedes. But for that minute or two, questions of wealth and conspicuous consumption didn't intrude at all. The nice shoes and the expensive suit and the flash car were beside the point. Kidnap attempts and bullets in the post seemed a long way away. The appeal of the moment resided in its banality. The point was the lack of self-consciousness, the ability when unobserved to behave just like normal people. Two hours earlier, David Beckham had done something not normal at all. Raul had just scored his second goal, Madrid's third, and United's fate was clear. What he did next said a lot about his character and his talent. This is a player who, whatever his technical virtues, is popularly supposed to be incapable of beating a man with the ball, a flaw which, in some eyes, denies him a claim to greatness. But when he took a short pass from Paul Scholes just outside the penalty area, Beckham shattered the myth. Faced by a Madrid defence good enough to have shut out Valencia's raiders in Paris this week, he put his head down and took them on. A player believed to have no pace weaved past one opponent from a standing start, past another, and past a third, all in the space of 10 yards, as if in a single swaying movement. And then, without breaking stride, he smashed a right-foot drive across Iker Casillas and into the roof of the net. It was anything but a typical Beckham goal. Perhaps its special nature was born out of anger and frustration, out of the knowledge that he and his team were about to lose their precious crown. Perhaps something in him, some self-denying ordinance rooted in an ingrained desire to put the interests of the team first, was momentarily liberated by that knowledge. Had it occurred in happier circumstances, they would still be showing it on television. As it was, it changed nothing. Except, perhaps, the perception of David Beckham's talent. \"He's a fantastic player, a very special and respected player,\" Rivaldo said yesterday, looking ahead to this afternoon's match at Wembley. \"His crosses are always dangerous.\" That's the conventional analysis, and it pays tribute to the way in which, thanks to some special alignment of the bones of ankle and foot, Beckham can whip the ball in from the right wing with an unprecedented degree of late curl and dip. Brazil's left-back - Silvinho of Arsenal - will be expecting a busy afternoon, with Beckham supported by Gary Neville, his club colleague, on England's right flank. \"I think David Beckham can have a bigger influence on the England set-up than he's had already,\" Kevin Keegan said yesterday. \"There's much more in him, and we've got to find a better way of getting it out. We have to demand more of him.\" It sounded promising, although he also talked about the value of Beckham's crosses. And that's the way England will probably operate today, using him as a conventional winger. But if he can score a goal like the one he registered against Real, which had nothing to do with his specialised ability to cross the ball, he can do practically anything. He could even find a way to use the example of Steve McManaman's display in Paris on Wednesday night to prove that, in the right setting and with the right colleagues around him, a player does not need to abandon his gift for wing play in order to exploit his vision of the game from the central areas. The time to do this is during the next five weeks, when Euro 2000 will provide him with the opportunity to measure his development since France 98, when he scored his first - and so far only - international goal with a wonderful free-kick against Colombia but then in the next game responded to Diego Simeone's trivial provocation and found himself being burned in effigy in his own country and forced to listen to obscene chants aimed at his wife. This week, two years and half a lifetime later, the silver Ferrari could be seen parked outside the Buckinghamshire hotel where England are preparing for their campaign, lined up amid the Jags and the Mercs and the Porsches of his team-mates.

Using it back to front, then walking the wrong way: with luck you'll see the cliff before you're airborne. Important features? Big base plate, bezel you can turn with gloves on, luminous needle. Good damping, so the needle settles fast. Why Silva? That's the Swedish company that invented it in 1932. Some call them protractor or flatbed compasses, because Suunto makes them, too. Suunto? Swedish again? Finnish. Navigation's very important to the Scandinavians. Ah, the trackless tundra? More like Major Ernst Killander, who took Stockholm's deprived youth into the forests in the 1920s. Do I want to hear this? The healthy new game was finding your way from A to B, aka orienteering. And it's hard to use a compass, map and protractor when you're running. So Silva built the compass on to the protractor? That's it. For pinpoint stuff, you still need a traditional prismatic compass and separate protractor, but the Silva is used by most walkers and explorers these days. An arm and a leg? Between \u00a311 and \u00a360: the widely-used Silva Type 4 is \u00a329. Prismatic pocket compasses cost \u00a340 to \u00a360. Do say: Allowing for magnetic variation, a bearing of 230 degrees will take us straight to the Dog and Duck. Don't say: Please, sir, why does this red needle keep moving about?",

As you go in you see a tiny snug, where farmers would come in from the country to arrange marriages. The whole pub has remained unaltered since the last century. What's the best thing: The day I turned up also happened to be the owner's birthday and she invited me to the party. I came back at 8pm and had to plead to be allowed out at 5am the next morning. I was taken on as one of the family. That level of hospitality is virtually unknown now in this country. Then there is the Beara peninsula, which is a truly magical place. Being on the edge of the Atlantic, there is something elemental about Beara and you can see 5,000 years of human habitation in the landscape. What triggers the memory: I live on the Sussex Downs and here the landscape is also dotted with early human habitation. I love that feeling of being part of a continuous line of humanity. My advice: You should leave the Anglo-Saxon part of you behind, with all your ideas of an organised trip and a definite timetable, and just leave yourself open to happy accidents. How do I get there? Fly to Cork and within half an hour , you can be sitting by the water, or you can be in Beara in two and half hours. \u0095McCarthy's Bar by Pete McCarthy is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton at \u00a312.99.",

The sun's beating down, there's a light breeze coming in from the sea - perfect for learning to paraglide - and we've all just been taught the \"parachute landing fall\" in the unlikely event of anything going wrong; make the mistake of landing with the wind behind you, we're told, and you can hit the ground at 40mph. </p> <p>Mike stands in front of me as I pull on the straps attached to the 27 square metres of canopy rustling about on the slope behind me. The leading edge lifts up, catches the wind and suddenly the entire canopy swells into life. The next thing I know he's pulling me down the hill yelling: \"Run! Run! Run!\" With all the grace of a duck-billed platypus, I perform a sort of slow motion dash down the hill and then the impossible happens: I take off. I fly. </p> <p>Okay, I might only have stayed up for a couple of minutes, but two hours earlier I was floundering about this hillside thinking the cows in the neighbouring field had more chance of getting airborne. There were eight in our group, every one a beginner and none of us particularly fit, but soon we were taking off shakily from the top of the slope and landing at the bottom stunned and exhilarated by what we had achieved. All it seemed to need was a little nerve - and a fair bit of sweat. </p> <p><strong> Paragliding</strong><br> </p> <p> Paragliding, a cross between parachuting and hang-gliding, began in the Alps in the mid-80s. \"It was invented by French hillclimbers who wanted a quick way of getting down the mountains in time for the all-important dinner ,\" says Phil Keen, of High Adventure, the Isle of Wight's paragliding and hang-gliding centre. </p> <p>With no less than 12 flying sites catering for all wind directions, the Isle of Wight is used as a training ground by many of the UK's top paragliders. British champion Barney Barnes and world record holder Sarah Fenwick both live here. </p> <p>We took a breather over lunch then it was time for the big one - a flight over the brilliant white cliffs that stretch from Compton Bay down to the Needles, the famous narrow chalk rocks stretching out into the sea. This is advanced stuff, so we flew with an instructor in a tandem paraglider sporting an enormous canopy - it felt like Sydney Opera House had unfurled above our heads. </p> <p>With the right conditions, paragliders can rise at 10m a second, which is almost like being catapulted into the clouds. We couldn't quite manage that but we did get up to about 600ft, high enough to look right over to the other side of the island, at the countless yachts nodding lazily through the Solent. </p> <p>As I sat back in the harness watching the shadows of clouds drifting across the island, a seagull appeared to our left, rising with us in the updraught. Below us was the beach where a dinosaur footprint was discovered. A little further up the coast, ramblers walking along the coastline stopped to wave up at us and cars slowed down for a better look at these two human beings hanging in the air. When we touched down bumpily about 30 minutes later, I'd already decided to come back and have a go at the two-day introductory course (\u00a3125, or \u00a3150 at weekends). </p> <p><strong> Extreme sports</strong><br> </p> <p> The Isle of Wight is often seen as a sleepy mecca for senior citizens (\"Loos to stay open after OAP power wins the day,\" was a front page story in the Isle of Wight County Press while we were there), but now it's seeking to reinvent itself as an extreme sports paradise. It already has the full-on sailing and partying mayhem of Cowes Week (which actually lasts a fortnight) at the beginning of August. But now companies such as First Contact are gathering together the other adrenaline-pumping attractions of the island - paragliding, mountain biking, jetskiing, canoeing, shooting, paintballing, sailing, horseriding, ribbing - and putting them into tailor-made packages for thrill-seekers who have neither the time nor the money to travel abroad for their fun. </p> <p><strong> Ribbing</strong><br> </p> <p> One of the biggest new Isle of Wight crazes is ribbing. Ribs are Rigid Inflatable Boats with seriously powerful engines at the back and seriously deranged skippers at the front. It's fairly simple. You step in, sit down and cling on for dear life. The engine whines like it's about to explode and you go thundering across the waves, pounding into the breakers like a big rubber mallet. You don't stop screaming till you're back on dry land. </p> <p><strong> Shooting</strong><br> </p> <p> After that, when they said they'd booked us in for clay-pigeon shooting, I wouldn't have been surprised if they'd given us machine-guns and told us the pigeons would be shooting back. </p> <p>David and Gerry, a charming pair of country gents in cravats and wellies, met us at the top of a gully with the words: \"Right, into the jungle then!\" Two 12-bore, double-barrelled shotguns were produced and we did four different kinds of shoot - grouse, pheasant, duck and partridge - the size, speed and flight pattern of the clay disks varying to imitate each type of bird (partridge is the smallest and the fastest). </p> <p>The trick is to follow the target through the sights then, just when it's in range, aim a little ahead - or, according to the Shooting Times, imagine the bird is wearing a top hat and aim for that. </p> <p><strong> Getting there</strong><br> </p> <p> The train from London to Portsmouth took about 90 minutes, and the Wightlink ferry crossing another 35 - but by the time you're on the Isle of Wight, the mainland bustle and rush seems much further away.

But even in this peaceful place, the new extreme-sports face of the Isle of Wight seems to be emerging: I took a stroll down to Ventnor beach and saw a couple of surfers riding the waves.

Between them, they cover about 10% of England and Wales and attract around 100 million visitors every year. </p> <p>The oldest of the parks - the Peak District, the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor - celebrate their 50th anniversaries next year, and the Government intends to add two more. Until now, all the parks, with the exception of the youngest, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, have been in the mountainous north and west of Britain. Controversially, the proposed new ones are both in the softer, southern underbelly of middle England, in the South Downs and the New Forest. Added to the promise of the first ever National Parks for Scotland - in Loch Lomond and the Trossachs and the Cairngorms - the National Parks movement finds itself in the political spotlight for the first time since the 1950s, when Clement Attlee's post-war Labour Government first set them up. </p> <p>But gone are the days when Cabinet members were tempted to stroll along Tom Stephenson's proposed Pennine Way while he subtly indoctrinated them with the National Park message. Today's swarming visitors to the parks are, like most of the present Cabinet, townies who perhaps are discovering, as John Muir - the great Scottish-born founder of the American National Parks system a century ago - did, that: \"Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilised people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wilderness is a necessity; and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life.\" </p> <p><strong>Brecon Beacons</strong><br></p> <p>The great striated sandstone escarpment of the Brecon Beacons towers like a tidal wave about to break over the green, hedged landscape of the Usk Valley beneath. The highest point of Pen-y-Fan (2,907ft/886m) is the most popular summit for hillwalkers, as the serious erosion around the summit and the heavily-restored but easy three-mile route up from the Storey Arms on the A470 show. The scalloped cwms of the south-facing central Beacons are a favourite launching site for hang-gliders and parascenders. </p> <p>The Beacons are bracketed to the west and east by two quite different ranges of hills, both confusingly described as Black. The Black Mountains to the east form a natural boundary between Wales and England, and are crossed by the Offa's Dyke National Trail. The Black Mountain, or Mynydd Ddu, to the west is the real \"wild west\" of the National Park, where little-visited summits such as Bannau Sir Gaer and Bannau Brycheiniog watch over a landscape rich in myths and legends. In sharp contrast is the delectable limestone country of beautiful waterfalls and caves that lies to the south, along the Mellte and Hepste rivers around Ystradfellte. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended walks:</strong> Try the six-mile circular from the Storey Arms to Corn Du and Pen y Fan, returning via the Tommy Jones Memorial and Y Gryn. Or, if you like things a little easier, the four-miler along the track of the former Abergavenny-Merthyr railway from to Govilon to Llanfoist and back along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal. </p> <p> <strong> Other activities:</strong> The Beacons are the pony-trekking centre of Wales, and many riding schools offer day rides into the hills for beginners. More strenuous - and only for the experienced - is the caving in the Ystradfellte valley, and there's yachting and windsurfing on Bala Lake. More leisurely boating can be enjoyed navigating a narrow boat on the Monmouth and Brecon Canal - the only one in a British National Park. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place:</strong> Lyn y Fan Fach, beneath Bannau Sir Gaer, in the Black Mountain. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended pub/B&amp;B:</strong> Upper Trewalkin Farm, near Talgarth (01874 711349). </p> <p> <strong> Maps:</strong> Ordnance Survey Outdoor Leisure Nos 12 &amp; 13, Brecon Beacons, West &amp; Central and Eastern areas. </p> <p> <strong> Further information from:</strong> Brecon Beacons National Park (01874 624437). </p> <p><strong>Norfolk Broads</strong> </p> <p>The origins of Britain's youngest national park were not discovered until the 1960s, when academics proved that, in common with most of Britain's \"wildernesses\", they were, in fact, man-made. </p> <p>For many years, the perceived wisdom was that the Broads - large, reed-fringed lakes and waterways centred on the Rivers Bure, Yare and Waveney between Yarmouth and Norwich - were natural, formed by the flood plains of those winding rivers. But then it was discovered that their sides were unnaturally steep, and were the result of flooded, large-scale medieval diggings when peat was used to heat places such as Norwich Cathedral. Even now, it is hard to imagine this \"last enchanted land\" of flat, misty fens and grazing marshes; slow, winding waterways; and tangled wet woodlands as anything but natural, so effective has been Nature's reclamation. </p> <p>The Broads are a boater's paradise, of course, but the waterways can get horribly crowded during the summer months. However, there's more to the Broads than the 130 miles of often-polluted and fast-eroding waterways for which they are best known. Visit the evocative ruins of St Benet's Abbey near Ludham or the remains of the Roman fort at Burgh Castle to see how Man has always been attracted to this underrated area. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended walks: </strong> From Berney Arms Station and Mill up the Yare Estuary and back across the Halvergate Marshes. You can see what the Broads looked like 100 years ago by taking the boarded walkway, suitable for wheelchairs, from Woodbastwick to the beautifully-restored Cockshoot Broad. </p> <p> <strong> Other activities:</strong> The Broads are obviously a great place for messing about in boats. If you want someone to do the sailing for you, try a trip on one of the famous black-sailed, broad-beamed Norfolk wherries,such as Hathor, or the Electric Eel, the park's electrically-powered boat. Bird and butterfly watchers and botanists are in their element in Britain's biggest protected wetland. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place:</strong> Toad Hole Cottage, near How Hill, on the River Ant. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended pub/B&amp;B:</strong> The Greyhound, Hickling (01692 598306). </p> <p> <strong> Maps: </strong> OS Outdoor Leisure No 40, The Broads. </p> <p> <strong> Further information from:</strong> Broads Authority (01603 610734). </p> <p><strong>Dartmoor</strong> </p> <p>Often dubbed \"the last wilderness of southern Britain\", Dartmoor is still perhaps best known for the grim prison buildings in the heart of the moor at Princetown. Although the story of the prison - originally built in 1809 to take French prisoners from the Napoleonic War - is inescapably part of the Dartmoor story, its history goes back much further. </p> <p>This now barren moorland is recognised as one of the finest \"fossilised\" prehistoric landscapes in Europe. Almost everywhere you look, there's evidence of prehistoric Man, whether it be hut circles (the most famous of which are found at Grimspound), cairns, stone circles or the enigmatic stone rows which, like the mysterious \"reaves\" or boundary banks, cross the moor for mile after mile. </p> <p>Geologically speaking, Dartmoor is a large \"knuckle\" or boss of granite in a series that extends north-east from Land's End. The open moor is punctuated by its distinctive tors - the weathered remnants of the former rock cover, such as Hound Tor, Hay Tor and Yes Tor - and is walkers' country. But walkers remain excluded from large parts of the northern moor, which the Army still uses for military training. </p> <p><strong> Recommended walks: </strong> The three-mile walk from Firth Bridge on the minor road that crosses Challacombe Down north of Widecombe and takes in Grimspound, Hameldon Tor and King's Barrow is a fine introduction to the prehistory of the moor. Wistman's Wood National Nature Reserve, full of stunted oaks dripping with mosses, can be reached by the two-mile walk north from Two Bridges, passing Crockern Tor, the meeting place of the Stannary (tin miners) Parliament. </p> <p><strong> Other activities:</strong> There are many pony-trekking centres, and there are few finer ways to appreciate this ancient landscape than on an all-day ride. There's good fishing, too, if you have a licence, on the fast-flowing rivers like the twin West and East Darts or Okements, which flow off the moor. One of the more eccentric activities is \"letter-boxing\" - that is, tracing the 500 or so letter boxes scattered in remote places. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place:</strong> The fairy tale Wistman's Wood, near Two Bridges. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended pub/B&amp;B:</strong> Warren House Inn, on the B3212 near Postbridge (01822 880208). </p> <p> <strong> Maps:</strong> OS Outdoor Leisure No 28, Dartmoor. </p> <p> <strong> Further information from:</strong> Dartmoor National Park (01626 832093). </p> <p><strong>Exmoor</strong> </p> <p>It might be unkind to call it \"Exmoor\", but in truth, the amount of true moorland that is left in Britain's least-visited and most intimate national park is now small. Only on the heights of Dunkery Beacon, the highest point at just over 1,700ft (519m), and on the boggy ridge of The Chains does the walker get that \"top of the world\" feeling you get with true moorland. </p> <p>But that's not to say that there are still plenty of wild places left in this precious remnant of what the rest of upland Devon and Somerset looked like before agricultural \"improvement\" tamed it. Some of the highest sea cliffs in England form the northern boundary, and are crossed by the roller-coaster route of the South West Coast Path National Trail. The beautiful wooded bays of the Bristol Channel coast, such as Woody Bay and Heddon's Mouth, provide some of the most striking coastal scenery in Britain, and wildlife watchers delight in spotting Exmoor's famous native herds of red deer - Britain's biggest land mammal. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended walks: </strong> Try the three-mile circular walk from Bossington over Bossington Hill and Selworthy Beacon for a grandstand view of Exmoor's dramatic coastline. Or walk west from Ilfracombe over The Torrs along the South West Coast Path to Lee Bay, the former home of smugglers and wreckers. </p> <p> <strong> Other activities:</strong> Like Dartmoor, Exmoor has its own primitive breed of ponies, and pony-trekking is popular. Lynmouth is a centre for surfers and sea-kayaking, and there's yachting and sailboarding on Wimbleball Lake. A newer and much more dangerous sport, is \"coasteering\", scrambling along the steep cliffs of the north coast. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place:</strong> Pinkworthy Pond on The Chains for what's left of wildest Exmoor. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended pub/B&amp;B:</strong> South Cheriton Farm, near Lynton (01598 753280). </p> <p> <strong> Maps:</strong> OS Outdoor Leisure No 9, Exmoor. </p> <p> <strong> Further information from:</strong> <strong> </strong> Exmoor National Park (01398 323665). </p> <p><strong>Lake District</strong> </p> <p> The National Park movement could be said to have started in the Lake District, when William Wordsworth first expressed the wish that it could be set aside \"as a sort of national property\". It took another 140 years to happen, but now the Lake District is the biggest and best-known, attracting 20 million visits a year. The reason is not hard to find - nowhere else in Britain has such a perfectly harmonious combination of mountain and lake, fell and dale.The tourist board is not guilty of hyperbole by calling it \"the most beautiful corner of England\". </p> <p>Most people come for the lakes, of which the most popular are Windermere, Coniston Water, Derwent Water and Ullswater. Others head for the hills, tempted by that doyen of guidebook writers, Alfred Wainwright. The Lake District's fells may be the highest in England, but they are easily attainable by the reasonably-fit walker guided by Wainwright's meticulous, if sometimes out-of-date, draughtsmanship. The vertiginous rock-climbing crags of Wasdale and Langdale were the birthplace of the sport in Britain. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended walks: </strong> One of the finest excursions in Lakeland is to take the steamer from Glenridding to Howtown and walk the seven glorious miles back along the eastern shore of Ullswater. Or just enjoy the four miles around the shores of lovely Buttermere in the heart of the Western Fells. </p> <p> <strong> Other activities:</strong> The crags of Wasdale Head and the Langdale Valley contain some of the finest rock-climbing in Britain. Water sports enthusiasts - yachting or canoeing - are catered for on Windermere, Derwent Water, Ullswater and Coniston. High-speed powerboats and water-skiers will be banned from Windermere by 2005. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place:</strong> This is difficult, but I might plump for Dock Tarn, above Watendlath. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended pub/B&amp;B:</strong> The Mason's Arms, Strawberry Bank, near Windermere (01539 568486). </p> <p> <strong> Maps: </strong> OS Outdoor Leisure Maps Nos 4, 5, 6, 7; The English Lakes, North Western; North Eastern; South Western and South Eastern areas. </p> <p> <strong> Further information from:</strong> Lake District National Park (01539 724555). </p> <p><strong>North York Moors</strong> </p> <p> The greatest glory of the North York Moors National Park is the vast expanse of purple heather - the finest in Britain - which carpets the moors in late summer. Despite their natural appearance, the moors have to be carefully managed to create that magnificent show. They are deliberately burned (or \"swaled\") by rotation in the spring to encourage the fresh growth of heather. </p> <p>The highest points of the moors are crossed by the 40-mile Lyke Wake Walk, a popular if arduous 24-hour challenge that has caused serious erosion problems and is no longer promoted. Much quieter are the park's 150 miles of glorious coastline facing the North Sea, and followed by the Cleveland Way National Trail. </p> <p>When you add the pretty village of Hutton-le-Hole, the Heartbeat country around Goathland, the coastal villages of Staithes and Robin Hood's Bay, and the glorious monastic ruins of Rievaulx and Byland, you'll see that the moors have much to offer. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended walks: </strong> The seven-mile walk from Old Byland via Nettle Dale to Rievaulx and back by Low Gill is a favourite, and for a taste of the high moors, try the four-mile circular walk from Clay Bank Top to the weird outcrops of the Wainstones and back via Hasty Bank. </p> <p> <strong> Other activities:</strong> There's gliding and hang-gliding from the moors escarpment at Hasty Bank, sailing on Gormire Lake, pony-trekking from a number of centres around the park, or fishing in the Rivers Esk, Derwent and Rye or off the North Sea coast. </p> <p><strong> Favourite place:</strong> I have a soft - not to say sore - spot for Ravenscar, because it marks the end of the Lyke Wake Walk! </p> <p> <strong> Recommended pub/B&amp;B:</strong> The Milburn Arms, Rosedale Abbey (01751 417312). </p> <p> <strong> Maps: </strong> OS Outdoor Leisure Map Nos 26 and 27, North York Moors, West and East. </p> <p> <strong> Further information from:</strong> North York Moors National Park (01439 770657). </p> <p><strong>Northumberland</strong> </p> <p> I always regard Northumberland as England's \"empty quarter\". With only five residents to the square mile and a mere 1.5 million visitors a year, Northumberland is the place to go if you really want to get away from it all. </p> <p>And this troubled landscape, the \"debateable land\" of the Border reivers for 300 years and still the scene of controversial Army manoeuvres and live firing on the Otterburn ranges, imparts a sense of history like no other. Everywhere you look, there are traces of the past, whether it is in the fortified houses at places like Elsdon or the unforgettable sight of Hadrian's Wall still marching across the neck of England after nearly 1,900 years. </p> <p>The challenge of The Cheviots, the bald and boggy last leg of the Pennine Way, is matched by gentler walking in the Simonside Hills or along the line of the Wall - soon to become a National Trail. To the west, the boring, bottle-brush conifers of the Border Forest spread around Kielder Water, the largest man-made lake in Europe. </p> <p><strong> Recommended walks:</strong> My favourite bit of the Wall is the two-mile stretch between Steel Rigg and Housesteads, across Hotbank and Cuddy's Crags - and it's also the best-preserved. The short walk over the historic landscape of Lordenshaws, with its hillfort and cup-and-ring marked stones at the foot of the Simonside Hills above Rothbury, is also not to be missed. </p> <p> <strong> Other activities:</strong> Mountain bikers are in their element on the forestry tracks of the Border Forest and around Kielder Water, where there are hiring facilities, and some water-based sport. There's a little climbing on the Whin Sill at Crag Lough on the Wall, but lots of opportunities for watching wildlife, including curlew, golden plover, peregrine falcon, buzzards and ravens on the moors, and roe deer and red squirrels in the forests. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place:</strong> Hen Hole in the College Valley. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended pub/B&amp;B:</strong> The Hermitage, Swinburne (01434 681248). </p> <p> <strong> Maps:</strong> OS Outdoor Leisure Maps No16, The Cheviot Hills; No 42, Kielder Water; and No 43, Hadrian's Wall. </p> <p> <strong> Further information from:</strong> Northumberland National Park (01434 605555). </p> <p><strong>Peak District</strong> </p> <p>The Peak District, the first National Park, has a split personality - the limestone White Peak of the centre and south of the park has a gentle character, with a network of drystone walls spreading across the softly swelling plateau which is split by intimate, steep-sided dales. The surrounding gritstone Dark Peak is, in contrast, a stern, forbidding, landscape of high and wild peat moorland with steep, dark \"edges\" of naked rock topped by weird, wind-eroded tors. </p> <p>The Peak is claimed to be the second most visited national park in the world, and its staggering 22 million annual visitors nearly all come from the surrounding ring of the towns and cities of the industrial North and Midlands. Half the population of England lives within 60 miles of its centre - and that's more than live within 60 miles of Charing Cross. The miracle is that you can still get away from it all by donning your boots and walking away from the honeypots of Bakewell (and its puddings) and Castleton (and its show caves). But places like Dovedale, perhaps the most beautiful of the White Peak dales, are worth avoiding on a summer weekend or Bank Holiday, when thousands will also flock to those villages which are holding their annual well-dressings - a unique and flourishing example of folk art. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended walks: </strong> For a taste of the gritstone edges and glorious views of the Derwent Valley, try the easy promenade along Froggatt Edge from the Curbar Gap car park. The four-mile concessionary footpath through the Lathkill Dale National Nature Reserve, starting either from Monyash or Over Haddon and returning via field paths above the dale, is also highly recommended. </p> <p> <strong> Other activities:</strong> The three-mile-long gritstone crag of Stanage Edge, near Hathersage, is a Mecca for rock-climbers with more than 500 routes up its steep, sharp walls, but when they are queuing at Stanage (and they do) there are many other climbing crags including Froggatt, Curbar and Birchin's Edges, and some spectacularly severe routes in the limestone dales at Ravenstor, Miller's Dale and the delightfully-named Water-cum-Jolly. Horse riders and cyclists enjoy the converted railway lines of the Tissington, High Peak and Monsal Trails, and there's sailing on the Errwood and Torside Reservoirs. Cavers head for the unseen, under- ground splendours of the Castleton area. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place:</strong> Lathkill Dale, or Alport Castles, Bleaklow. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended pub/B&amp;B:</strong> <strong> </strong> The Barrel, Bretton (01433 630856). </p> <p> <strong> Maps:</strong> OS Outdoor Leisure Maps Nos 1, The Dark Peak and 24, The White Peak. </p> <p> <strong> Further information from:</strong> Peak District National Park (01629 816200). </p> <p><strong>Pembrokeshire Coast</strong> </p> <p> The Pembrokeshire Coast is the only predominantly coastal national park in Britain, so everything is influenced by the pounding waters of the Atlantic and the Irish Sea. Nowhere are you more than 10 miles from the sea, and most places are only three miles from it. </p> <p>The best way to see the park is from the 180-mile Pembrokeshire Coast Path National Trail, which runs from Amroth to Cardigan and passes above the rugged, wave-battered cliffs and secluded, sandy coves. And the best time to walk this superb route is in the spring or early summer, when it is carpeted in a riot of wild flowers. Lying just off-shore but easily accessible by boat are Pembrokeshire's islands, - including Grassholm, Skomer, Skokholm and Ramsey Island - which are famous for their huge colonies of seabirds such as gannets and Manx shearwaters. </p> <p>The hidden, inner sanctum of the park is the area inland from the natural harbour of Milford Haven, which is known as the Daugleddau, where extensive reed and mudbanks fringe well-wooded shores, in complete contrast to the sea cliffs of the coast. To the north lies the other inland part of the park, centred on the Preseli Hills from which came Stonehenge's celebrated bluestones. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended walks: </strong> One of the most spectacular sections of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path is the six-mile circuit of the rocky headland of St David's, which overlooks Ramsey Sound and Island. Or if you want to ponder how the bluestones got to Stonehenge, try the five-mile walk from Rosebush to the Preseli's summit at Foel Cwm Cerwyn (1,760ft/536m). </p> <p> <strong> Other activities:</strong> Pembrokeshire is Britain's Californian-style surfers' paradise, and beaches like Freshwater East and West, Broad Haven, Manorbier and Whitesands are renowned for their consistently good waves crashing in from the Atlantic. Sailing on the prevailing south-westerlies is based at the safe anchorages of Tenby, Saundersfoot, Solva or Angle, but there's also windsurfing, diving and canoeing and kayaking. Sea-cliff climbing is centred on the Castlemartin and St David's Head areas. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place: </strong> St Govan's Chapel, St Govan's Head. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended pub/B&amp;B:</strong> Tregyon, Gwaun Valley (01239 820531). </p> <p> <strong> Maps:</strong> OS Outdoor Leisure Maps Nos 35 and 36, North and South Pembrokeshire. </p> <p> <strong> Further information from:</strong> <strong> </strong> Pembrokeshire Coast National Park (01437 764636). </p> <p><strong>Snowdonia</strong> </p> <p> The finest mountain scenery south of the Border awaits the visitor. Centred on the 3,560ft/1,085m peak of Snowdon, (more correctly Yr Wyddfa), the park also takes in the ranges of the Carneddau and the Glyders, the Moelwyns and the Arans, the Rhinogs and Arenigs, with Cadair Idris in the south. It also includes about 23 miles of the best coastal scenery of Tremadog and Barmouth Bays. </p> <p>The Welsh name for Snowdonia is Eryri - which is translated as either the abode of eagles or simply the high place, either of which fit this rugged, uncompromising landscape. These forbidding heights have sheltered generations of Welsh nationalists ever since the days of Owain Glyndwr, and Welsh is the accepted first language for 65% of the local population. </p> <p>This inherent foreignness is reflected in the almost Alpine scenery of the highest hills, where rare Arctic and Alpine plants, like the fabled Snowdon lily, still flourish in the rocky recesses of places like the Devil's Kitchen (Twll Du) above Lyn Idwal. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended walks: </strong> There are at least seven well-trodden routes to Snowdon's summit, but all are serious mountain expeditions and none should be undertaken lightly with poor equipment or navigation skills. You can always, of course, take the train to the summit, but shorter and safer walking routes include the famous three-mile Precipice Walk along the superb Mawddach Estuary, near Dolgellau, or the four-mile forest trail through the Gwydyr Forest near Betws-y-Coed, for fine views of the Snowdon range. </p> <p> <strong> Other activities:</strong> Rock climbers drool over cliffs like Clogwyn dur Arddu, or \"Cloggy\" as it is affectionately known to its aficionados, on Snowdon and the vertical crags of Dinas Cromlech in the Llanberis Pass. Beginners can learn the skills at the National Centre for Mountain Activities at Plas y Brenin, Capel Curig. Water-sports enthusiasts are catered for at Bala Lake or on the coast at the National Water Sports Centre at Plas Menai. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place:</strong> Cwm Cau, Cadair Idris. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended pub/B&amp;B:</strong> <strong> </strong> Llwyndu Farmhouse, Llanaber, Barmouth (01341 280144). </p> <p> <strong> Maps:</strong> OS Outdoor Leisure Maps Nos 17, 18 and 23, Snowdonia, Snowdon &amp; Conwy Valley; Harlech, Portmadog &amp; Bala, and Cadair Idris &amp; Lake Bala. </p> <p> <strong> Further information from:</strong> Snowdonia National Park (01766 770274). </p> <p><strong>Yorkshire Dales</strong> </p> <p> Limestone lies at the heart of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, with some of the finest examples of karst scenery to be found in Britain. The showplaces are the great 250ft high amphitheatre of Malham Cove - once a waterfall higher than Niagara - the awesome cleft of Gordale Scar, and the great hooded cowl of Kilnsey Crag in Wharfedale. But just as fascinating, on a smaller scale, are the acres of limestone pavement like those around Ingleborough, each grike (or fissure) creating its own micro-climate to nurture a wealth of wildflowers in its cool and shaded depths. Capping the limestone are the Yoredale grits, which give us the stepped \"lion couchant\" profiles of magnificent hills like Ingleborough, Whernside and Pen y Ghent - the famed Yorkshire Three Peaks. </p> <p>Although the only extractive industry in the Dales today are the unsightly limestone quarries at places like Swinden and Horton-in-Ribblesdale, the valleys were once the scene of extensive lead mining and, in places like Gunnerside Gill and Old Gang Beck in Swaledale, there are still many evocative remains of \"t'owd man\". </p> <p> <strong> Recommended walks:</strong> Described by Wainwright as \"of its kind, surely the most delightful walk in the country\" and suitable for all the family is the four-mile Waterfalls Walk, which passes a series of beautiful waterfalls in the valleys of the Twiss and Doe above Ingleton. A glimpse of the limestone wonders of the park is provided by the five-mile excursion from Malham up the side of the Cove via the Pennine Way to Water Sinks and back via the dry valley of Watlowes. </p> <p> <strong> Other activities:</strong> After walking and climbing, caving (known here as potholing) is one of the most popular activities, and there are many serious routes centred on places like Clapham and Ingleborough. The rock climbing is mostly on limestone, and there are many classic routes at places like Malham Cove, Gordale Scar and Kilnsey Crag. Cyclists can enjoy the 130-mile circular Yorkshire Dales Cycle Way starting and finishing in Skipton, and there is a network of bridleways to accommodate horse riders. </p> <p> <strong> Favourite place:</strong> Gunnerside in Swaledale. </p> <p> <strong> Recommended pub/B&amp;B:</strong> The Wensleydale Heifer, West Witton (01969 622322). </p> <p> <strong> Maps:</strong> OS Outdoor Leisure Maps Nos 2 and 30; Yorkshire Dales: Southern &amp; Western areas; Northern &amp; Central areas. </p> <p> <strong> Further information from:</strong> Yorkshire Dales National Park (01969 650456). </p> <p>\u0095Roly Smith, former head of information services to the Peak District National Park and chairman of the Outdoor Writers' Guild, is the editor of a new series of official guides to the National Parks.

      "bodyText": "The paradox of Britain's 11 National Parks is that they are neither owned by the nation, nor are they parks in the usually-accepted, swings and roundabouts, sense. Unlike the national parks of larger countries, the British ones are all lived-in landscapes, where most of the land is still privately owned. Yet somehow they have survived as the wildest and most treasured landscapes in England and Wales. The reason is that their outstandingly-beautiful and well-loved countrysides hold the highest available designation of landscape protection. Between them, they cover about 10% of England and Wales and attract around 100 million visitors every year. The oldest of the parks - the Peak District, the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor - celebrate their 50th anniversaries next year, and the Government intends to add two more. Until now, all the parks, with the exception of the youngest, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, have been in the mountainous north and west of Britain. Controversially, the proposed new ones are both in the softer, southern underbelly of middle England, in the South Downs and the New Forest. Added to the promise of the first ever National Parks for Scotland - in Loch Lomond and the Trossachs and the Cairngorms - the National Parks movement finds itself in the political spotlight for the first time since the 1950s, when Clement Attlee's post-war Labour Government first set them up. But gone are the days when Cabinet members were tempted to stroll along Tom Stephenson's proposed Pennine Way while he subtly indoctrinated them with the National Park message. Today's swarming visitors to the parks are, like most of the present Cabinet, townies who perhaps are discovering, as John Muir - the great Scottish-born founder of the American National Parks system a century ago - did, that: \"Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilised people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wilderness is a necessity; and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life.\" Brecon Beacons The great striated sandstone escarpment of the Brecon Beacons towers like a tidal wave about to break over the green, hedged landscape of the Usk Valley beneath. The highest point of Pen-y-Fan (2,907ft/886m) is the most popular summit for hillwalkers, as the serious erosion around the summit and the heavily-restored but easy three-mile route up from the Storey Arms on the A470 show. The scalloped cwms of the south-facing central Beacons are a favourite launching site for hang-gliders and parascenders. The Beacons are bracketed to the west and east by two quite different ranges of hills, both confusingly described as Black. The Black Mountains to the east form a natural boundary between Wales and England, and are crossed by the Offa's Dyke National Trail. The Black Mountain, or Mynydd Ddu, to the west is the real \"wild west\" of the National Park, where little-visited summits such as Bannau Sir Gaer and Bannau Brycheiniog watch over a landscape rich in myths and legends. In sharp contrast is the delectable limestone country of beautiful waterfalls and caves that lies to the south, along the Mellte and Hepste rivers around Ystradfellte. Recommended walks: Try the six-mile circular from the Storey Arms to Corn Du and Pen y Fan, returning via the Tommy Jones Memorial and Y Gryn. Or, if you like things a little easier, the four-miler along the track of the former Abergavenny-Merthyr railway from to Govilon to Llanfoist and back along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal. Other activities: The Beacons are the pony-trekking centre of Wales, and many riding schools offer day rides into the hills for beginners. More strenuous - and only for the experienced - is the caving in the Ystradfellte valley, and there's yachting and windsurfing on Bala Lake. More leisurely boating can be enjoyed navigating a narrow boat on the Monmouth and Brecon Canal - the only one in a British National Park. Favourite place: Lyn y Fan Fach, beneath Bannau Sir Gaer, in the Black Mountain. Recommended pub/B&amp;B: Upper Trewalkin Farm, near Talgarth (01874 711349). Maps: Ordnance Survey Outdoor Leisure Nos 12 &amp; 13, Brecon Beacons, West &amp; Central and Eastern areas. Further information from: Brecon Beacons National Park (01874 624437). Norfolk Broads The origins of Britain's youngest national park were not discovered until the 1960s, when academics proved that, in common with most of Britain's \"wildernesses\", they were, in fact, man-made. For many years, the perceived wisdom was that the Broads - large, reed-fringed lakes and waterways centred on the Rivers Bure, Yare and Waveney between Yarmouth and Norwich - were natural, formed by the flood plains of those winding rivers. But then it was discovered that their sides were unnaturally steep, and were the result of flooded, large-scale medieval diggings when peat was used to heat places such as Norwich Cathedral. Even now, it is hard to imagine this \"last enchanted land\" of flat, misty fens and grazing marshes; slow, winding waterways; and tangled wet woodlands as anything but natural, so effective has been Nature's reclamation. The Broads are a boater's paradise, of course, but the waterways can get horribly crowded during the summer months. However, there's more to the Broads than the 130 miles of often-polluted and fast-eroding waterways for which they are best known. Visit the evocative ruins of St Benet's Abbey near Ludham or the remains of the Roman fort at Burgh Castle to see how Man has always been attracted to this underrated area. Recommended walks: From Berney Arms Station and Mill up the Yare Estuary and back across the Halvergate Marshes. You can see what the Broads looked like 100 years ago by taking the boarded walkway, suitable for wheelchairs, from Woodbastwick to the beautifully-restored Cockshoot Broad. Other activities: The Broads are obviously a great place for messing about in boats. If you want someone to do the sailing for you, try a trip on one of the famous black-sailed, broad-beamed Norfolk wherries,such as Hathor, or the Electric Eel, the park's electrically-powered boat. Bird and butterfly watchers and botanists are in their element in Britain's biggest protected wetland. Favourite place: Toad Hole Cottage, near How Hill, on the River Ant. Recommended pub/B&amp;B: The Greyhound, Hickling (01692 598306). Maps: OS Outdoor Leisure No 40, The Broads. Further information from: Broads Authority (01603 610734). Dartmoor Often dubbed \"the last wilderness of southern Britain\", Dartmoor is still perhaps best known for the grim prison buildings in the heart of the moor at Princetown. Although the story of the prison - originally built in 1809 to take French prisoners from the Napoleonic War - is inescapably part of the Dartmoor story, its history goes back much further. This now barren moorland is recognised as one of the finest \"fossilised\" prehistoric landscapes in Europe. Almost everywhere you look, there's evidence of prehistoric Man, whether it be hut circles (the most famous of which are found at Grimspound), cairns, stone circles or the enigmatic stone rows which, like the mysterious \"reaves\" or boundary banks, cross the moor for mile after mile. Geologically speaking, Dartmoor is a large \"knuckle\" or boss of granite in a series that extends north-east from Land's End. The open moor is punctuated by its distinctive tors - the weathered remnants of the former rock cover, such as Hound Tor, Hay Tor and Yes Tor - and is walkers' country. But walkers remain excluded from large parts of the northern moor, which the Army still uses for military training. Recommended walks: The three-mile walk from Firth Bridge on the minor road that crosses Challacombe Down north of Widecombe and takes in Grimspound, Hameldon Tor and King's Barrow is a fine introduction to the prehistory of the moor. Wistman's Wood National Nature Reserve, full of stunted oaks dripping with mosses, can be reached by the two-mile walk north from Two Bridges, passing Crockern Tor, the meeting place of the Stannary (tin miners) Parliament. Other activities: There are many pony-trekking centres, and there are few finer ways to appreciate this ancient landscape than on an all-day ride. There's good fishing, too, if you have a licence, on the fast-flowing rivers like the twin West and East Darts or Okements, which flow off the moor. One of the more eccentric activities is \"letter-boxing\" - that is, tracing the 500 or so letter boxes scattered in remote places. Favourite place: The fairy tale Wistman's Wood, near Two Bridges. Recommended pub/B&amp;B: Warren House Inn, on the B3212 near Postbridge (01822 880208). Maps: OS Outdoor Leisure No 28, Dartmoor. Further information from: Dartmoor National Park (01626 832093). Exmoor It might be unkind to call it \"Exmoor\", but in truth, the amount of true moorland that is left in Britain's least-visited and most intimate national park is now small. Only on the heights of Dunkery Beacon, the highest point at just over 1,700ft (519m), and on the boggy ridge of The Chains does the walker get that \"top of the world\" feeling you get with true moorland. But that's not to say that there are still plenty of wild places left in this precious remnant of what the rest of upland Devon and Somerset looked like before agricultural \"improvement\" tamed it. Some of the highest sea cliffs in England form the northern boundary, and are crossed by the roller-coaster route of the South West Coast Path National Trail. The beautiful wooded bays of the Bristol Channel coast, such as Woody Bay and Heddon's Mouth, provide some of the most striking coastal scenery in Britain, and wildlife watchers delight in spotting Exmoor's famous native herds of red deer - Britain's biggest land mammal. Recommended walks: Try the three-mile circular walk from Bossington over Bossington Hill and Selworthy Beacon for a grandstand view of Exmoor's dramatic coastline. Or walk west from Ilfracombe over The Torrs along the South West Coast Path to Lee Bay, the former home of smugglers and wreckers. Other activities: Like Dartmoor, Exmoor has its own primitive breed of ponies, and pony-trekking is popular. Lynmouth is a centre for surfers and sea-kayaking, and there's yachting and sailboarding on Wimbleball Lake. A newer and much more dangerous sport, is \"coasteering\", scrambling along the steep cliffs of the north coast. Favourite place: Pinkworthy Pond on The Chains for what's left of wildest Exmoor. Recommended pub/B&amp;B: South Cheriton Farm, near Lynton (01598 753280). Maps: OS Outdoor Leisure No 9, Exmoor. Further information from: Exmoor National Park (01398 323665). Lake District The National Park movement could be said to have started in the Lake District, when William Wordsworth first expressed the wish that it could be set aside \"as a sort of national property\". It took another 140 years to happen, but now the Lake District is the biggest and best-known, attracting 20 million visits a year. The reason is not hard to find - nowhere else in Britain has such a perfectly harmonious combination of mountain and lake, fell and dale.The tourist board is not guilty of hyperbole by calling it \"the most beautiful corner of England\". Most people come for the lakes, of which the most popular are Windermere, Coniston Water, Derwent Water and Ullswater. Others head for the hills, tempted by that doyen of guidebook writers, Alfred Wainwright. The Lake District's fells may be the highest in England, but they are easily attainable by the reasonably-fit walker guided by Wainwright's meticulous, if sometimes out-of-date, draughtsmanship. The vertiginous rock-climbing crags of Wasdale and Langdale were the birthplace of the sport in Britain. Recommended walks: One of the finest excursions in Lakeland is to take the steamer from Glenridding to Howtown and walk the seven glorious miles back along the eastern shore of Ullswater. Or just enjoy the four miles around the shores of lovely Buttermere in the heart of the Western Fells. Other activities: The crags of Wasdale Head and the Langdale Valley contain some of the finest rock-climbing in Britain. Water sports enthusiasts - yachting or canoeing - are catered for on Windermere, Derwent Water, Ullswater and Coniston. High-speed powerboats and water-skiers will be banned from Windermere by 2005. Favourite place: This is difficult, but I might plump for Dock Tarn, above Watendlath. Recommended pub/B&amp;B: The Mason's Arms, Strawberry Bank, near Windermere (01539 568486). Maps: OS Outdoor Leisure Maps Nos 4, 5, 6, 7; The English Lakes, North Western; North Eastern; South Western and South Eastern areas. Further information from: Lake District National Park (01539 724555). North York Moors The greatest glory of the North York Moors National Park is the vast expanse of purple heather - the finest in Britain - which carpets the moors in late summer. Despite their natural appearance, the moors have to be carefully managed to create that magnificent show. They are deliberately burned (or \"swaled\") by rotation in the spring to encourage the fresh growth of heather. The highest points of the moors are crossed by the 40-mile Lyke Wake Walk, a popular if arduous 24-hour challenge that has caused serious erosion problems and is no longer promoted. Much quieter are the park's 150 miles of glorious coastline facing the North Sea, and followed by the Cleveland Way National Trail. When you add the pretty village of Hutton-le-Hole, the Heartbeat country around Goathland, the coastal villages of Staithes and Robin Hood's Bay, and the glorious monastic ruins of Rievaulx and Byland, you'll see that the moors have much to offer. Recommended walks: The seven-mile walk from Old Byland via Nettle Dale to Rievaulx and back by Low Gill is a favourite, and for a taste of the high moors, try the four-mile circular walk from Clay Bank Top to the weird outcrops of the Wainstones and back via Hasty Bank. Other activities: There's gliding and hang-gliding from the moors escarpment at Hasty Bank, sailing on Gormire Lake, pony-trekking from a number of centres around the park, or fishing in the Rivers Esk, Derwent and Rye or off the North Sea coast. Favourite place: I have a soft - not to say sore - spot for Ravenscar, because it marks the end of the Lyke Wake Walk! Recommended pub/B&amp;B: The Milburn Arms, Rosedale Abbey (01751 417312). Maps: OS Outdoor Leisure Map Nos 26 and 27, North York Moors, West and East. Further information from: North York Moors National Park (01439 770657). Northumberland I always regard Northumberland as England's \"empty quarter\". With only five residents to the square mile and a mere 1.5 million visitors a year, Northumberland is the place to go if you really want to get away from it all. And this troubled landscape, the \"debateable land\" of the Border reivers for 300 years and still the scene of controversial Army manoeuvres and live firing on the Otterburn ranges, imparts a sense of history like no other. Everywhere you look, there are traces of the past, whether it is in the fortified houses at places like Elsdon or the unforgettable sight of Hadrian's Wall still marching across the neck of England after nearly 1,900 years. The challenge of The Cheviots, the bald and boggy last leg of the Pennine Way, is matched by gentler walking in the Simonside Hills or along the line of the Wall - soon to become a National Trail. To the west, the boring, bottle-brush conifers of the Border Forest spread around Kielder Water, the largest man-made lake in Europe. Recommended walks: My favourite bit of the Wall is the two-mile stretch between Steel Rigg and Housesteads, across Hotbank and Cuddy's Crags - and it's also the best-preserved. The short walk over the historic landscape of Lordenshaws, with its hillfort and cup-and-ring marked stones at the foot of the Simonside Hills above Rothbury, is also not to be missed. Other activities: Mountain bikers are in their element on the forestry tracks of the Border Forest and around Kielder Water, where there are hiring facilities, and some water-based sport. There's a little climbing on the Whin Sill at Crag Lough on the Wall, but lots of opportunities for watching wildlife, including curlew, golden plover, peregrine falcon, buzzards and ravens on the moors, and roe deer and red squirrels in the forests. Favourite place: Hen Hole in the College Valley. Recommended pub/B&amp;B: The Hermitage, Swinburne (01434 681248). Maps: OS Outdoor Leisure Maps No16, The Cheviot Hills; No 42, Kielder Water; and No 43, Hadrian's Wall. Further information from: Northumberland National Park (01434 605555). Peak District The Peak District, the first National Park, has a split personality - the limestone White Peak of the centre and south of the park has a gentle character, with a network of drystone walls spreading across the softly swelling plateau which is split by intimate, steep-sided dales. The surrounding gritstone Dark Peak is, in contrast, a stern, forbidding, landscape of high and wild peat moorland with steep, dark \"edges\" of naked rock topped by weird, wind-eroded tors. The Peak is claimed to be the second most visited national park in the world, and its staggering 22 million annual visitors nearly all come from the surrounding ring of the towns and cities of the industrial North and Midlands. Half the population of England lives within 60 miles of its centre - and that's more than live within 60 miles of Charing Cross. The miracle is that you can still get away from it all by donning your boots and walking away from the honeypots of Bakewell (and its puddings) and Castleton (and its show caves). But places like Dovedale, perhaps the most beautiful of the White Peak dales, are worth avoiding on a summer weekend or Bank Holiday, when thousands will also flock to those villages which are holding their annual well-dressings - a unique and flourishing example of folk art. Recommended walks: For a taste of the gritstone edges and glorious views of the Derwent Valley, try the easy promenade along Froggatt Edge from the Curbar Gap car park. The four-mile concessionary footpath through the Lathkill Dale National Nature Reserve, starting either from Monyash or Over Haddon and returning via field paths above the dale, is also highly recommended. Other activities: The three-mile-long gritstone crag of Stanage Edge, near Hathersage, is a Mecca for rock-climbers with more than 500 routes up its steep, sharp walls, but when they are queuing at Stanage (and they do) there are many other climbing crags including Froggatt, Curbar and Birchin's Edges, and some spectacularly severe routes in the limestone dales at Ravenstor, Miller's Dale and the delightfully-named Water-cum-Jolly. Horse riders and cyclists enjoy the converted railway lines of the Tissington, High Peak and Monsal Trails, and there's sailing on the Errwood and Torside Reservoirs. Cavers head for the unseen, under- ground splendours of the Castleton area. Favourite place: Lathkill Dale, or Alport Castles, Bleaklow. Recommended pub/B&amp;B: The Barrel, Bretton (01433 630856). Maps: OS Outdoor Leisure Maps Nos 1, The Dark Peak and 24, The White Peak. Further information from: Peak District National Park (01629 816200). Pembrokeshire Coast The Pembrokeshire Coast is the only predominantly coastal national park in Britain, so everything is influenced by the pounding waters of the Atlantic and the Irish Sea. Nowhere are you more than 10 miles from the sea, and most places are only three miles from it. The best way to see the park is from the 180-mile Pembrokeshire Coast Path National Trail, which runs from Amroth to Cardigan and passes above the rugged, wave-battered cliffs and secluded, sandy coves. And the best time to walk this superb route is in the spring or early summer, when it is carpeted in a riot of wild flowers. Lying just off-shore but easily accessible by boat are Pembrokeshire's islands, - including Grassholm, Skomer, Skokholm and Ramsey Island - which are famous for their huge colonies of seabirds such as gannets and Manx shearwaters. The hidden, inner sanctum of the park is the area inland from the natural harbour of Milford Haven, which is known as the Daugleddau, where extensive reed and mudbanks fringe well-wooded shores, in complete contrast to the sea cliffs of the coast. To the north lies the other inland part of the park, centred on the Preseli Hills from which came Stonehenge's celebrated bluestones. Recommended walks: One of the most spectacular sections of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path is the six-mile circuit of the rocky headland of St David's, which overlooks Ramsey Sound and Island. Or if you want to ponder how the bluestones got to Stonehenge, try the five-mile walk from Rosebush to the Preseli's summit at Foel Cwm Cerwyn (1,760ft/536m). Other activities: Pembrokeshire is Britain's Californian-style surfers' paradise, and beaches like Freshwater East and West, Broad Haven, Manorbier and Whitesands are renowned for their consistently good waves crashing in from the Atlantic. Sailing on the prevailing south-westerlies is based at the safe anchorages of Tenby, Saundersfoot, Solva or Angle, but there's also windsurfing, diving and canoeing and kayaking. Sea-cliff climbing is centred on the Castlemartin and St David's Head areas. Favourite place: St Govan's Chapel, St Govan's Head. Recommended pub/B&amp;B: Tregyon, Gwaun Valley (01239 820531). Maps: OS Outdoor Leisure Maps Nos 35 and 36, North and South Pembrokeshire. Further information from: Pembrokeshire Coast National Park (01437 764636). Snowdonia The finest mountain scenery south of the Border awaits the visitor. Centred on the 3,560ft/1,085m peak of Snowdon, (more correctly Yr Wyddfa), the park also takes in the ranges of the Carneddau and the Glyders, the Moelwyns and the Arans, the Rhinogs and Arenigs, with Cadair Idris in the south. It also includes about 23 miles of the best coastal scenery of Tremadog and Barmouth Bays. The Welsh name for Snowdonia is Eryri - which is translated as either the abode of eagles or simply the high place, either of which fit this rugged, uncompromising landscape. These forbidding heights have sheltered generations of Welsh nationalists ever since the days of Owain Glyndwr, and Welsh is the accepted first language for 65% of the local population. This inherent foreignness is reflected in the almost Alpine scenery of the highest hills, where rare Arctic and Alpine plants, like the fabled Snowdon lily, still flourish in the rocky recesses of places like the Devil's Kitchen (Twll Du) above Lyn Idwal. Recommended walks: There are at least seven well-trodden routes to Snowdon's summit, but all are serious mountain expeditions and none should be undertaken lightly with poor equipment or navigation skills. You can always, of course, take the train to the summit, but shorter and safer walking routes include the famous three-mile Precipice Walk along the superb Mawddach Estuary, near Dolgellau, or the four-mile forest trail through the Gwydyr Forest near Betws-y-Coed, for fine views of the Snowdon range. Other activities: Rock climbers drool over cliffs like Clogwyn dur Arddu, or \"Cloggy\" as it is affectionately known to its aficionados, on Snowdon and the vertical crags of Dinas Cromlech in the Llanberis Pass. Beginners can learn the skills at the National Centre for Mountain Activities at Plas y Brenin, Capel Curig. Water-sports enthusiasts are catered for at Bala Lake or on the coast at the National Water Sports Centre at Plas Menai. Favourite place: Cwm Cau, Cadair Idris. Recommended pub/B&amp;B: Llwyndu Farmhouse, Llanaber, Barmouth (01341 280144). Maps: OS Outdoor Leisure Maps Nos 17, 18 and 23, Snowdonia, Snowdon &amp; Conwy Valley; Harlech, Portmadog &amp; Bala, and Cadair Idris &amp; Lake Bala. Further information from: Snowdonia National Park (01766 770274). Yorkshire Dales Limestone lies at the heart of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, with some of the finest examples of karst scenery to be found in Britain. The showplaces are the great 250ft high amphitheatre of Malham Cove - once a waterfall higher than Niagara - the awesome cleft of Gordale Scar, and the great hooded cowl of Kilnsey Crag in Wharfedale. But just as fascinating, on a smaller scale, are the acres of limestone pavement like those around Ingleborough, each grike (or fissure) creating its own micro-climate to nurture a wealth of wildflowers in its cool and shaded depths. Capping the limestone are the Yoredale grits, which give us the stepped \"lion couchant\" profiles of magnificent hills like Ingleborough, Whernside and Pen y Ghent - the famed Yorkshire Three Peaks. Although the only extractive industry in the Dales today are the unsightly limestone quarries at places like Swinden and Horton-in-Ribblesdale, the valleys were once the scene of extensive lead mining and, in places like Gunnerside Gill and Old Gang Beck in Swaledale, there are still many evocative remains of \"t'owd man\". Recommended walks: Described by Wainwright as \"of its kind, surely the most delightful walk in the country\" and suitable for all the family is the four-mile Waterfalls Walk, which passes a series of beautiful waterfalls in the valleys of the Twiss and Doe above Ingleton. A glimpse of the limestone wonders of the park is provided by the five-mile excursion from Malham up the side of the Cove via the Pennine Way to Water Sinks and back via the dry valley of Watlowes. Other activities: After walking and climbing, caving (known here as potholing) is one of the most popular activities, and there are many serious routes centred on places like Clapham and Ingleborough. The rock climbing is mostly on limestone, and there are many classic routes at places like Malham Cove, Gordale Scar and Kilnsey Crag. Cyclists can enjoy the 130-mile circular Yorkshire Dales Cycle Way starting and finishing in Skipton, and there is a network of bridleways to accommodate horse riders. Favourite place: Gunnerside in Swaledale. Recommended pub/B&amp;B: The Wensleydale Heifer, West Witton (01969 622322).

      "body": "<p>On a warm summer's morning you can stand on the banks of Ardingly reservoir, deep in the Sussex countryside, watching the mist rise off the water and the great crested grebes flying past, and believing for a while that the world is a place of peace and harmony. </p> <p>That's what Laura Moffatt did one day this month, taking in the familiar sights and scents and breathing the fresh air. She grew up in nearby Crawley, where she is Labour MP, and has always relied on this corner of the Weald as a place to go walking with her family and visit country pubs. </p> <p>The morning idyll by the reservoir was soon fractured by another Boeing 747 coming into nearby Gatwick Airport, and before long it was time for her to catch the train to London for another day at the House of Commons, where peace and harmony no doubt took a further knock. </p> <p>But she'll be back many times with her husband Colin and terrier Manny (as in Lord Manny Shinwell, the veteran Labour politician) to look at the calm water and walk up the hill past the red-brick Victorian buildings of Ardingly College and the \"hammer pond\" at Saucelands. </p> <p>From the pond, they do a circuit through woods and fields to Ardingly village - building styles medieval to executive box - and back to the reservoir car park. This is the area they visited when they were young and short of money, driving an old banger and drinking at the Gardener's Arms. </p> <p>\"These are all home walks for me, for days when there are other things to be done. You can be at Ardingly, or even in the Ashdown Forest, in about 10 minutes from where we live. It's very different from when we go to Cornwall on holiday and go for long walks along the cliffs. </p> <p>\"I'm a bit of a townie, though - it's lovely to go for walks, but I also like to see signs of people coming and going. I'm not very keen on disappearing into the wilds and not seeing anyone for ages. This area suits me because it's very diverse, a living landscape where there's plenty going on. </p> <p>\"I prefer to walk with Colin. Then it's a time for relaxing and talking and having a giggle. If I'm alone, it's different - I tend to relive the mistakes, how I could have done things better at the Commons, think about future battles. I've been known to talk to myself, saying out loud the things that are going round in my head.\" </p> <p>After visits to the Falklands and Kosovo with the defence select committee, Moffatt is fully kitted out with weatherproof gear: \"I enjoy going out in the rain - I just get well wrapped up and go. I'm not much of a sunshine person because of my pale skin, and now I've got these wonderful walking boots, I'm ready for anything.\" </p> <p><strong>High Weald Landscape Trail</strong></p> <p>The walk described by Laura Moffatt touches on England's latest waymarked long-distance path - a 90-mile west-to-east crossing of the High Weald, the great undulating stretch of heath and woodland that sits between the steep chalk rims of the North and South Downs. </p> <p>The High Weald Landscape Trail offers a week of walking, starting from Horsham in West Sussex, continuing past East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells into Kent, then curving south through flatter countryside to the ancient port of Rye on the Channel coast. </p> <p>The route has been designed to pass close to public transport, pubs and places to stay, wildlife areas, and attractions such as historic houses. Famous gardens, such as Sissinghurst, Nymans and Bedgebury Pinetum are all within striking distance. </p> <p>It also gives an insight into the forces that have shaped the landscape, especially the iron industry which dominated until the 18th century, stripping the woodland for charcoal and building dams and \"hammer ponds\" for water power. </p> <p>Also seen are old brick kilns, apple orchards, hop gardens, oast houses and meadows of grazing sheep: less definable is the closed and dreamy atmosphere retained by the Weald in spite of its nearness to London. Siegfried Sassoon, brought up in the area, called it \"green contentedness.\" </p> <p>Gerry Sherwin, of the High Weald Unit, said they started to plan the route by mapping places they wanted it to pass. \"There are lots of long-distance paths in these parts, but they tend to focus on the Downs or run north-south through the Weald. </p> <p>\"We wanted to go east-west and give people the opportunity to see the variety of the landscape, from the hills of the High Weald to the river valleys near Rye. This approach has been more common in the last two or three years - a lot of paths just take you from A to B without necessarily taking in the best parts.\" </p> <p>Work included putting boardwalks over muddy sections, clearing branches and bushes, replacing stiles, and putting up the waymarks, which show a church and an oak tree. Sherwin said early feedback indicated people liked to walk the path over three weekends, using public transport, pubs and B&amp;Bs.</p>",

That's what Laura Moffatt did one day this month, taking in the familiar sights and scents and breathing the fresh air. She grew up in nearby Crawley, where she is Labour MP, and has always relied on this corner of the Weald as a place to go walking with her family and visit country pubs. The morning idyll by the reservoir was soon fractured by another Boeing 747 coming into nearby Gatwick Airport, and before long it was time for her to catch the train to London for another day at the House of Commons, where peace and harmony no doubt took a further knock. But she'll be back many times with her husband Colin and terrier Manny (as in Lord Manny Shinwell, the veteran Labour politician) to look at the calm water and walk up the hill past the red-brick Victorian buildings of Ardingly College and the \"hammer pond\" at Saucelands. From the pond, they do a circuit through woods and fields to Ardingly village - building styles medieval to executive box - and back to the reservoir car park. This is the area they visited when they were young and short of money, driving an old banger and drinking at the Gardener's Arms. \"These are all home walks for me, for days when there are other things to be done. You can be at Ardingly, or even in the Ashdown Forest, in about 10 minutes from where we live. It's very different from when we go to Cornwall on holiday and go for long walks along the cliffs. \"I'm a bit of a townie, though - it's lovely to go for walks, but I also like to see signs of people coming and going. I'm not very keen on disappearing into the wilds and not seeing anyone for ages. This area suits me because it's very diverse, a living landscape where there's plenty going on. \"I prefer to walk with Colin. Then it's a time for relaxing and talking and having a giggle. If I'm alone, it's different - I tend to relive the mistakes, how I could have done things better at the Commons, think about future battles. I've been known to talk to myself, saying out loud the things that are going round in my head.\" After visits to the Falklands and Kosovo with the defence select committee, Moffatt is fully kitted out with weatherproof gear: \"I enjoy going out in the rain - I just get well wrapped up and go. I'm not much of a sunshine person because of my pale skin, and now I've got these wonderful walking boots, I'm ready for anything.\" High Weald Landscape Trail The walk described by Laura Moffatt touches on England's latest waymarked long-distance path - a 90-mile west-to-east crossing of the High Weald, the great undulating stretch of heath and woodland that sits between the steep chalk rims of the North and South Downs. The High Weald Landscape Trail offers a week of walking, starting from Horsham in West Sussex, continuing past East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells into Kent, then curving south through flatter countryside to the ancient port of Rye on the Channel coast. The route has been designed to pass close to public transport, pubs and places to stay, wildlife areas, and attractions such as historic houses. Famous gardens, such as Sissinghurst, Nymans and Bedgebury Pinetum are all within striking distance. It also gives an insight into the forces that have shaped the landscape, especially the iron industry which dominated until the 18th century, stripping the woodland for charcoal and building dams and \"hammer ponds\" for water power. Also seen are old brick kilns, apple orchards, hop gardens, oast houses and meadows of grazing sheep: less definable is the closed and dreamy atmosphere retained by the Weald in spite of its nearness to London. Siegfried Sassoon, brought up in the area, called it \"green contentedness.\" Gerry Sherwin, of the High Weald Unit, said they started to plan the route by mapping places they wanted it to pass. \"There are lots of long-distance paths in these parts, but they tend to focus on the Downs or run north-south through the Weald. \"We wanted to go east-west and give people the opportunity to see the variety of the landscape, from the hills of the High Weald to the river valleys near Rye. This approach has been more common in the last two or three years - a lot of paths just take you from A to B without necessarily taking in the best parts.\" Work included putting boardwalks over muddy sections, clearing branches and bushes, replacing stiles, and putting up the waymarks, which show a church and an oak tree. Sherwin said early feedback indicated people liked to walk the path over three weekends, using public transport, pubs and B&amp;Bs.",

As midnight approached, the only other people left drinking were two men in their early forties with long, thick hair. The one wearing a sheepskin waistcoat caught us watching his wrist, thickly festooned with camel bells. He smiled. </p> <p>\"Before we go, I'd like you to smell this,\" he said. The vial smelled of vanilla and jasmine. We assured him it was pleasant and handed it back. He hoisted a scarlet sack on his back with the air of a man setting off on an expedition to Rivendell, bade us goodnight and went jingling on his way. </p> <p>Glastonbury is a kind of theme park, unique in that the staff work unpaid and bring their own costumes. The theme is esoteric beliefs and New Age wisdom, and so strong is the town's reputation as a centre for the alternative in everything that, without much effort from tourist boards, it sucks in a cast of brightly-clothed hippy visionaries, travellers, elderly psychic healers and American spiritual seekers to perpetuate its image and fascinate those who have come merely to spectate. At Disneyland, the guy in the Mickey Mouse costume doesn't believe he's a 6ft rodent. In Glastonbury, the hippy greeters are real. </p> <p>Does the cast extend to ghosts? The George and Pilgrim, dating back to 1455, is said to be haunted, although nobody seemed quite sure who was supposed to be doing the haunting. Yet as we climbed the stairs to bed, there was no sense of foreboding, only that deep, spicy scent of 500 years of keeping rain at bay. </p> <p>Art, and the imagination, know two kinds of ghost.

In her nightmare, it had seemed that someone else was in the room with us. She tried to switch on the light. It wouldn't work.

You can go on a spiritual pilgrimage to Glastonbury, find meaning in the lines and the hills and the energy fields, and dream ghostly dreams.

      "bodyText": "We sat in the bar of the George and Pilgrim Hotel, under blackened beams, our whiskies resting on tables so old and split that only the thick layer of polish seemed to be holding them together. As midnight approached, the only other people left drinking were two men in their early forties with long, thick hair. The one wearing a sheepskin waistcoat caught us watching his wrist, thickly festooned with camel bells. He smiled. \"Before we go, I'd like you to smell this,\" he said. The vial smelled of vanilla and jasmine. We assured him it was pleasant and handed it back. He hoisted a scarlet sack on his back with the air of a man setting off on an expedition to Rivendell, bade us goodnight and went jingling on his way. Glastonbury is a kind of theme park, unique in that the staff work unpaid and bring their own costumes. The theme is esoteric beliefs and New Age wisdom, and so strong is the town's reputation as a centre for the alternative in everything that, without much effort from tourist boards, it sucks in a cast of brightly-clothed hippy visionaries, travellers, elderly psychic healers and American spiritual seekers to perpetuate its image and fascinate those who have come merely to spectate. At Disneyland, the guy in the Mickey Mouse costume doesn't believe he's a 6ft rodent. In Glastonbury, the hippy greeters are real. Does the cast extend to ghosts? The George and Pilgrim, dating back to 1455, is said to be haunted, although nobody seemed quite sure who was supposed to be doing the haunting. Yet as we climbed the stairs to bed, there was no sense of foreboding, only that deep, spicy scent of 500 years of keeping rain at bay. Art, and the imagination, know two kinds of ghost. There's the spirit that haunts for the hell of it, as in Henry James' The Turn of the Screw or countless jokey Scooby Doo sagas of haunted houses and headless Elizabethans. Then there's the Ghost with the Message, like Hamlet's father, a notion eagerly adopted by Hollywood hits such as Ghost and, most recently, the Bruce Willis vehicle The Sixth Sense.

      "body": "<p>London has never been so much fun for kids. This year, more than 30 million people will flood in from abroad and around Britain to enjoy the capital, often travelling as families. Nothing deters them - the unreliable weather, derided public transport nor the super-high prices. So, how come so many parents living in or near London equate family time off with avoiding the city? </p> <p>Once you give a child the power of choice, you might be surprised at how much fun they - and their parents - can have in London. And not necessarily at a high cost. My sons, London born and raised, consider public transport an essential part of a day out. It suits me, too. A family travelcard is good value, and it is hard to beat riding upstairs in double-decker buses (front row, of course), zipping over east London on the Docklands Light Railway or painlessly slicing through the jammed-up city by Underground. </p> <p>Parents might presume that kids want to see the new and the gimmicky. Indeed, in London's recent revival, children have not been forgotten. The big museums create new rooms with ever more hands-on gadgets. The newly-expanded National Maritime Museum has two excellent interactive galleries for children; the Natural History Museum lets the child become the scientist. Among the new landmarks, the BA London Eye looms above the skyline with expensive temptation - a justifiable one, for once. </p> <p>But when the choice is theirs, children often demand the old favourites - watching the Changing of the Guard, clambering up and down HMS Belfast's ladders, peering down on London from the top of St Paul's Cathedral, rowing in Regent's Park and experiencing the Blitz at the Imperial War Museum. </p> <p>When an American family stayed with us last summer, the top vote after three hectic London days went to the simple bus trip to see Big Ben and hear it strike the hour. </p> <p>The secret of success for a family London outing seems to be to let the children take the lead. Simply provide them with all the information and options. If the pyramids were last week's history lesson, you might find yourself at the British Museum; if it was King John and the Magna Carta, you could soon be gazing at one of several versions in the British Library (where kids can also create their own book). </p> <p>Here are a dozen top London outings: </p> <p>1<strong> London Aquarium</strong> Queen's Walk SE1 </p> <p> A subterranean aquatic wonderland of floor-to-ceiling tanks. Its centrepiece is the three-storey-high Atlantic Tank, where divers give the appearance of risking their lives each day at noon to feed the fierce-looking dogfish sharks, conger eels and seabass. We especially like stroking the rays in the Discovery Zone and watching the newly-arrived octopuses untangle their legs. Activity, quiz and trail sheets from the ticket desk. </p> <p> Tel: 020-7967 8000. Nearest tube: Westminster/ Waterloo. Open: 10am- 6pm. Adults: \u00a38.50, kids 3-14: \u00a35. </p> <p> 2<strong> Imperial War Museum </strong> Lambeth Road SE1 </p> <p> A surprising favourite to some. Less about fighting, more about survival during war. We like going through the first world war trench experience, complete with smells, and the second world war blitz experience in a recreated London street. Half-term specials include re-enactments of Operation Dynamo Rescue from Dunkirk, and a chance to crack the codes in the display Enigma: The Code Breakers. Activity sheets from reception; permanent poetry hunt through the museum. </p> <p> Tel: 020-7416 5000. Nearest tube: Lambeth North. Open: 10am-6pm. Adults: \u00a35.50, kids under 16: free. </p> <p> 3 <strong> HMS Belfast</strong> Morgan's Lane SE1 </p> <p> It is amazing how much fun a stationary ship can be. This huge warship built for the British Navy and now moored opposite the Tower of London, was almost destroyed by a German mine in 1939. Small children love scrambling up and down the ladders, exploring its warren of rooms, inspecting the guns and engines, and defending their captain on the bridge. Quiz sheets from ticket kiosk. </p> <p> Tel: 020-7940 6328. Nearest tube: London Bridge/Tower Hill. Open: 10am-6pm. Adults \u00a35; kids under 16: free. </p> <p> 4<strong> National Maritime Museum</strong> Greenwich </p> <p> Perhaps go down by boat and come back by Docklands Light Railway. Up at the Observatory, part of the museum, you can stand over the Meridian Line and attend an excellent live planetarium show (Madame Tussaud's one is automated). Among the 16 new galleries of the main museum, try sending Morse code signals in the All Hands Gallery or steering a Viking ship in The Bridge Gallery. The Story of Time told in the Queen's House includes a family trail. Lots of activities. </p> <p> Tel: 020-8858 4422. Nearest station: Cutty Sark DLR; Greenwich, Connex. Open: 10am-5pm. Adults: National Maritime Museum \u00a37.50, Royal Observatory \u00a36, Story of Time \u00a37.50; kids under 16: free. </p> <p> 5<strong> Regent's Park</strong> </p> <p> If the sun shines, take a picnic, bat and ball and get settled in somewhere on the north side of the lake. For on-site entertainment, there are the ducks nearby (with useful identification board); boating on the lake, life jackets supplied; the Open-Air Theatre (from June 7, the children's play is Alice: An Adventure in Wonderland, tel: 020-7486 2431); and the Zoo. </p> <p> Tel: 020-7486 7905. Nearest tube: Baker Street/Regent's Park. Open: 5am-dusk. Free. </p> <p> 6<strong> National Portrait Gallery</strong> St Martin's Place, WC2 </p> <p> What we like best is finding pictures of people we know something about. A good way to start is to take Britain's longest overland escalator (23m) to the Tudor Gallery in the new wing; stairs from here lead up to a rooftop restaurant and bar. Lower down in the same wing, you can put a face to more recent names in the 20th Century Gallery, or visit the IT Gallery to call up your favourite Brits and then print off a map that plots where to find their portraits. </p> <p> Tel: 020-7306 0055. Nearest tube: Trafalgar Square. Open: Mon-Sat 10am-6pm, Sun noon-6pm. Free. </p> <p> 7 <strong> Natural History Museum</strong> Cromwell Road SW7 </p> <p> You need to be selective in this huge museum, or the visit falls flat. In the Life Galleries, we like the Dinosaur room best; in the Earth Galleries, it is the model volcano and earthquake simulation. Investigate, a new project in the Clore Education Centre (sometimes only open to school parties), lets children study real specimens ranging from meteorites to animal skins. </p> <p> Tel: 020-7942 5000. Open: Mon-Sat 10am-5.30pm. Sun 11am-5.30pm. Nearest tube: South Kensington. Adults: \u00a37.50, kids under 18: free. </p> <p> 8<strong> London Zoo</strong> Outer Circle NW1 </p> <p> Not cheap, but it occupies the day and you can have a picnic on the lawns (perhaps watching the impressive predatory birds display). The Web of Life gallery has 65 different kinds of animals doing intriguing things: watching the leaf-cutter ants march mindlessly along their rope is slightly spooky. Check out the events: penguins are often fed at 2.30pm, elephants weighed at 3pm and bathed at 3.30pm, and keepers give talks in the amphitheatre. The roars of hungry lions are wonderfully frightening. </p> <p> Tel: 020-7722 3333. Nearest tube: Camden Town. Open: 10am-5.30pm. Adults \u00a39, kids 3-14: \u00a37. </p> <p> 9 <strong> Tate Modern and Millennium Bridge</strong> Bankside SE1 </p> <p> Already very popular. But everyone will enjoy the building and its riverside caf\u00e9 and shops. And if the art is unfamiliar - or unfathomable - for parents, try the new family trails called Explorers (starts June 1), each focusing on one suite of rooms; they include Time Capsule to inspire you to make your own piece of history. </p> <p> Tel:020-7887 8000. Nearest tube: Southwark/London Bridge. Open: Sun-Thurs 10am-6pm; Fri-Sat 10am-10pm. Free. </p> <p> 10 <strong> Museum of London </strong> London Wall EC2 </p> <p> With all the rebuilding in London, this collection gets better all the time. We pour over the models of Roman London and always wish we could go to more events than we do. Weekend family ones include handling objects washed up beside the Thames, while workshops might involve making coins or shoes, or working with the archaeologists. </p> <p> Tel: 020-7600 3699. Nearest tube: Barbican/St Paul's. Open: Mon-Sat 10am-5.50pm, Sun noon-5.50pm. Adults \u00a35, kids under 16 free. </p> <p> 11<strong> The BBC Experience </strong> Portland Place, W1 </p> <p> A mixture of information, performance and participation makes this a great outing, best booked in advance. It lasts about two hours. Your guide gives a speedy history of the Beeb, then it is your turn to perform. Everyone gets a part and, within a few minutes, you have recorded a radio programme and had a laugh listening to the result. Among the interactive games that follow, try reading a weather forecast on TV (kids usually perform better than adults) or commentating on a football game. </p> <p> Tel: 0870 6030304. Nearest tube: Regent's Park. Open: Mon 11am-4.30pm, Tues-Sun noon-4.30pm. Adults \u00a37.50, kids: \u00a34.95. </p> <p> 12<strong> The BA London Eye</strong> Jubilee Gardens SE1 </p> <p> If you can master the automatic booking system and its endless instructions, plus collect the tickets from County Hall as there is no postal service, this is a truly memorable ride. (Very patient people could queue up on the day.) It lasts 30 minutes during which you are gradually lifted up above London and have time to enjoy the spectacular views - bad weather only makes it more dramatic, even if you cannot see so far. </p> <p> Tel: 0870 5000600. Nearest tube: Waterloo/Westminster. Open: 10am-9.30pm. Adults: \u00a37.45, kids: \u00a34.95. </p> <p>\u0095 Louise Nicholson's Look Out London, A Children's Guide, with illustrations by Paul Cox, is published this month by Red Fox at \u00a34.99.</p>",

Adults: \u00a37.50, kids under 18: free. 8 London Zoo Outer Circle NW1 Not cheap, but it occupies the day and you can have a picnic on the lawns (perhaps watching the impressive predatory birds display). The Web of Life gallery has 65 different kinds of animals doing intriguing things: watching the leaf-cutter ants march mindlessly along their rope is slightly spooky. Check out the events: penguins are often fed at 2.30pm, elephants weighed at 3pm and bathed at 3.30pm, and keepers give talks in the amphitheatre. The roars of hungry lions are wonderfully frightening. Tel: 020-7722 3333. Nearest tube: Camden Town. Open: 10am-5.30pm. Adults \u00a39, kids 3-14: \u00a37. 9 Tate Modern and Millennium Bridge Bankside SE1 Already very popular. But everyone will enjoy the building and its riverside caf\u00e9 and shops. And if the art is unfamiliar - or unfathomable - for parents, try the new family trails called Explorers (starts June 1), each focusing on one suite of rooms; they include Time Capsule to inspire you to make your own piece of history. Tel:020-7887 8000. Nearest tube: Southwark/London Bridge. Open: Sun-Thurs 10am-6pm; Fri-Sat 10am-10pm. Free. 10 Museum of London London Wall EC2 With all the rebuilding in London, this collection gets better all the time. We pour over the models of Roman London and always wish we could go to more events than we do. Weekend family ones include handling objects washed up beside the Thames, while workshops might involve making coins or shoes, or working with the archaeologists. Tel: 020-7600 3699. Nearest tube: Barbican/St Paul's. Open: Mon-Sat 10am-5.50pm, Sun noon-5.50pm. Adults \u00a35, kids under 16 free. 11 The BBC Experience Portland Place, W1 A mixture of information, performance and participation makes this a great outing, best booked in advance. It lasts about two hours. Your guide gives a speedy history of the Beeb, then it is your turn to perform. Everyone gets a part and, within a few minutes, you have recorded a radio programme and had a laugh listening to the result. Among the interactive games that follow, try reading a weather forecast on TV (kids usually perform better than adults) or commentating on a football game. Tel: 0870 6030304. Nearest tube: Regent's Park. Open: Mon 11am-4.30pm, Tues-Sun noon-4.30pm. Adults \u00a37.50, kids: \u00a34.95. 12 The BA London Eye Jubilee Gardens SE1 If you can master the automatic booking system and its endless instructions, plus collect the tickets from County Hall as there is no postal service, this is a truly memorable ride. (Very patient people could queue up on the day.) It lasts 30 minutes during which you are gradually lifted up above London and have time to enjoy the spectacular views - bad weather only makes it more dramatic, even if you cannot see so far. Tel: 0870 5000600. Nearest tube: Waterloo/Westminster. Open: 10am-9.30pm. Adults: \u00a37.45, kids: \u00a34.95. \u0095 Louise Nicholson's Look Out London, A Children's Guide, with illustrations by Paul Cox, is published this month by Red Fox at \u00a34.99.",

However, the Post moved into more controversial territory when it went on to speculate that the film might have something to do with Scientology as well - Battlefield Earth is based on a novel by its founder, L Ron Hubbard, while Travolta is Scientology's most enthusiastic talk-show apologist. Travolta has been quick to deny any connection between the film and his beliefs. And he's got a point: while Scientology critics have had hours of fun untangling a few scraps of ham-fisted allegory left over from the novel, the uninitiated are likely to be underwhelmed by the film's cult content. In fact, the whole controversy has done little more than highlight a profoundly depressing fact: these days, when Hollywood people decide to make fools of themselves, the neighbourhood guru is no longer the first port of call.</p> <p>This is a great shame, because the movie business has a long and glorious history of trying to combine the search for enlightenment and the quest for boffo box-office. It goes back at least as far as 1924, when Samuel Goldwyn set sail for Europe with the intention of offering Sigmund Freud $100,000 to help him create \"a really great love story\". (Alas, Freud passed on the offer.) But the greatest age of all, in terms of Hollywood consciousness-raising, was the 70s - the Me Decade, when the growth of a lucrative mass market for psychobabble meant that skip-loads of gurus came out of the woodwork to cope with the thousands of paisley-clad peons looking to straighten their heads.</p> <p>In their book Hollywood On The Couch, Stephen Farber and Marc Green share the results of their extensive research on the alternative therapies doing the rounds of Beverly Hills in the heady days of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. These included bioenergetics, psychosynthesis, the Feldenkreis method, Silva mind control, primal screaming, biofeedback and Rolfing - which, far from being the exotic perversion it sounds, is a painful type of muscle massage. Naturally, not every novel form of self-help has been an ongoing success among movie types; you don't hear much about celebrity Rolfing any more (although Farber and Green report that Sean Young \"once confided to an interviewer that she had been \u00efseriously Rolfed'\"). However, some of the more digestible elements of the consciousness revolution have passed into the mainstream.</p> <p>Take, for example, all those movies that aim to speak to \"the child in all of us\". The Inner Child - with whom Steven Spielberg and George Lucas seem to enjoy an almost indecent rapport - is a concept lifted straight from the pages of Dr Eric \"I'm OK - You're OK\" Berne. (As the author of such kipper-tie classics as Games People Play, Berne was also responsible for introducing the world to the idea of the Life Script.)</p> <p>Then there's the aggressive self-love of movie folk. One key text for this is the 1973 bestseller How To Be Your Own Best Friend by Mildred Newman and Bernard Berkowitz, a folksy pair of pop psychologists who once ministered to a small platoon of celebrity narcissists including George Segal, Neil Simon, Joel Schumacher and Anthony Perkins. But the acknowledged leader in this field was Werner Erhard - the founder of Erhard Seminars Training, better known as est.</p> <p>This was an enormously influential blend of dianetics, Zen and motivational psychology, which Erhard (a former used-car salesman) cobbled together in 1971. The training involved an intense weekend of sitting in a huge seminar room and being ranted at by Erhard or one of his assistants. The theme of the introductory lecture was \"you're all assholes\", and, since bathroom breaks were prohibited, powerful bladder control was essential. (According to Bert Convy, who played an Erhard-like character in the 1978 Burt Reynolds comedy Semi-Tough, people who wet themselves were told to \"experience the warmth\".)</p> <p>Erhard's teachings emphasised personal responsibility for everything in your life. Victimhood was anathema to est. Rounded up in the Holocaust? You put yourself in that camp, pal - deal with it. John Denver, Yoko Ono and Diana Ross were among the celebrities who took this bracing message to heart, but est's biggest success was in the executive suite. Ted Ashley, then head of Warner Brothers, was so enthusiastic about Erhard that his studio became known as Werner Brothers. Peter Guber, the sometime head of Sony Pictures, was another convert, as was the music and movie mogul David Geffen. (Geffen also exploited the est connection to smooth out his business dealings with Ashley).</p> <p>The screenwriting guru Syd Field went so far as to dedicate his enormously influential book Screenplay \"to Werner and all the people in est\" (which may or may not explain why so many Hollywood movies are obsessed with manic individualism, self-confrontation and off-the-peg introspection). Joel Schumacher told Farber and Green he had such a revelation after some est weekends (\"It hit me like the sword from Star Wars\") that he found the inner strength to make the transition from lowly costume designer to highly paid hack director - which means we have Werner to thank for such cinematic marvels as Batman Forever.</p> <p>Unfortunately, est went belly up long ago. It was always controversial - one graduate took the you-can-do-anything message too literally and was institutionalised after taking some deep breaths at the bottom of his swimming pool - and Erhard finally disappeared in the early 90s amid lawsuits alleging various cult-leader-style excesses.</p> <p>Since then, nothing has caught the imagination of the A-list in quite the same way.

It's shot with the same frenetic, desperate-to-be-hip aesthetic as the film, with scenes slowing down and speeding up at random to create the illusion that you are watching something thrillingly cutting edge, ie a medium-budget beer ad. Casual violence is peppered throughout, homophobia masquerades as humour, and the women are only capable of stripping, working in pubs or having a quick shag. There's little sign of it being able to transcend the film's plot, which, like a crap magician stuffing a rabbit slowly up his sleeve, just isn't as clever the second time around. If the Lock, Stock titles weren't plastered over every break, you'd be forgiven for thinking they'd remade Minder. Another couple of episodes, and you might wish they had. \u0095 Lock, Stock... And Four Stolen Hooves, 9pm, Monday, C4",

      "body": "<p>For half a century Muriel Spark has been stripping away human vanity with the force of a blowtorch. \"You will end up as a girl-guide leader in a suburb like Corstorphine,\" withers Jean Brodie, Spark's most famous heroine, to one of her young charges. And her now infamous demolition of Marie Stopes, an adversary during Spark's time as editor of the Poetry Review, vibrates with her signature tone: \"I used to think it a pity that her mother rather than she had not thought of birth control,\" Spark said, with an irony so delicate there is no sound of tearing as the knife goes in. </p> <p>Because of this, her polite curiosity comes across in conversation as a front for more ruthless operations; her generous manner as a ruse to draw out pretensions. Naturally, this is absurd. Now 82, she sits in her study in Tuscany with her wicked red hair and her merry eyes, the very incarnation of her novels: quick, compact, like a sparrow with its head to one side, prospecting for worms. She smiles, revealing small white teeth, perfectly cut. \"Now,\" she says, after dispensing with preliminaries, \"what is it you are wearing?\" </p> <p>She has lived here, an hour from Florence, for the last 20 years. It is not an idyllic hideaway in Tuscany's New Labour belt, but a dark, crumbling presbytery conversion on a hilltop outside Arezzo, an industrial town where the outlying villages are one generation removed from poverty. It is a fitting backdrop for a woman to whom dark and dramatic things seem to happen, or at least, who presents them as such in the retelling. Over the last decade, five of Spark's pet dogs have been poisoned, in a case that made the front page of the Italian newspapers. \"Who killed Muriel's dogs?\" demanded La Repubblica last March, while Spark rallied international attention and sealed her reputation among locals as a \"mad Englishwoman\". </p> <p>Back in 1939, Nita McEwen, an old school friend to whom she bore a striking resemblance, was shot dead in a boarding house in Rhodesia. Spark, boarding there also, entered the sitting room the following day and was perceived, amid much screaming, to be the ghost of the dead woman. </p> <p>Perhaps to protect herself from these bizarre confrontations, Spark derives a brittle energy working them into her fiction and consoling herself with the belief that, as John Masefield once told her, \"all experience is good for the artist\". It is possible that she welcomes a good fight as fuel for her eloquence; she is at her finest when under siege. For the last three years, she has maintained a high-profile dispute with her son, Robin, in which she has referred to him as a \"lousy\" artist, consumed by \"jealousy and resentment\". There may be some teasing in this, not of Robin, but of the pious observers to whom displays of \"bad motherhood\" are kindling for moral outrage. Nonetheless, friends wince at her forthrightness and she is reputed to be \"difficult\", infuriated by sloppy reasoning and poised, cat-like, to strike at anyone who subjects her to it, even her own son. She is not a woman restrained by sentiment. </p> <p>This is not to say she is without close friends. She shares her home with its owner, Penelope Jardine, a sculptor who has been her companion and assistant since they met in Rome in the 1960s and is, like Spark, a person to whom the sinister has a full-bodied presence in daily life. When Jardine lived in London, she was troubled by a man who persistently called her flat asking to be put in touch with the previous occupant. \"It was plain from the questions he asked that he was intending to rub him out,\" she says over tea. This is exactly the kind of scenario that Spark swoops on for her fiction: the hitman on the phone, the diamond smuggler down the street, the vast improbability that forces the reader to reassess, mid-flow, what kind of book he is dealing with. </p> <p>Spark is equally disorienting in person: \"I had my bag stolen from the back of my chair in a restaurant in Florence,\" she recalls. \"It had an unfinished poem about a hat in it. When I went to the police, they asked me what was in the bag, and I said, there was a poem. The policeman said can you describe the poem? I said, it was about a hat. I didn't get the feeling he took it seriously at all.\" </p> <p>Not taking Spark seriously is an error that critics have been sporadically making since her first novel, The Comforters, was published in 1957. \"Brief, brittle and nasty in an arch kind of way,\" the critic Robert Nye wrote of her in 1971. A bad-tempered review of The Hothouse By The East River in 1973 called it \"elliptical and dotty\". In 1992 when her autobiography, Curriculum Vitae, was submitted for publication in America, word reached Spark that one of the editors had condemned it as \"so full of calculated madness\" that they couldn't publish. Spark was swift in her assassination. \"I said, 'She has dedicated her menopause to me'. I left it at that.\" </p> <p>The huffy reviews were possibly provoked by Spark's talent for toying with her readers' expectations. It is an approach she occasionally takes too far: at the end of Hothouse, readers discover with a dizzy plunge that all the protagonists are dead and have been since the opening page. The characters in a Spark novel are held within a symbolic order that is not altogether reliable. </p> <p>\"What made her fiction in the 60s very important and exhilarating is that she seemed to have found a way of making it new,\" says David Lodge, the novelist and academic who numbers Spark among the most influential of the post-war novelists. \"She uses the omniscient authorial voice, not as it appears in the classical novel, but in a very playful, whimsical, unexpected way, jerking the reader about on the end of a string. The first time I read Jean Brodie, I was baffled. The technique has become familiar now, but at the time it seemed extraordinary.\" </p> <p>\"There is an intellectual energy that is staggering and touching and amazing,\" says Iris Birtwistle, the poet, whose work Spark first published in the Poetry Review. \"She carves with a very sharp knife. Muriel Spark was the keenest, sharpest, most agile brain that I ever came across. She is light years more intelligent than most people.\" </p> <p>THE greatest non-sequitur pulled off by Muriel Spark has been that of her own life. She knew that she wanted to write and she knew how she wanted to write, but it was many years before she was in a financial position to do anything beyond getting by. From the outset, however, she had a sort of damn-you self-assurance that kept her from editing her style to suit publishers' fancies. </p> <p>\"I was very much myself,\" she says. \"I felt I should be getting as much money as people like Kingsley Amis, who was my contemporary.\" Spark, however, was from a background quite at odds with the tenor of her prose - that glittering levity enabled by not having to worry about paying the gas bill. \"I had a certain throw-away attitude which really didn't belong to my upbringing. I had to adapt it to a life that was totally different from that of the people who had used that kind of prose style before. It usually belonged to people of leisure and I had always had to struggle.\" </p> <p>She was born Muriel Camberg in Edinburgh in 1918, to a Scots-Jewish father and an English mother, a fact that her own son, Robin, would contest 70 years later in a bid to vindicate his own religious choices by claiming that both his grandparents were Jewish. \"My mother and father were both religious,\" says Spark. \"But not along any sectarian line. They believed in the Almighty.\" Her confidence in her own talent was formidable. As a child she liked reading Sir Walter Scott's Border Ballads and eavesdropping on adult conversations, both of which stimulated what she later called, her \"literary sense\", a highly-tuned ear for language. </p> <p>Her precocious interest in literature (she was reading Browning and Swinburne at 11) was not shared by her parents, an engineer and a music teacher, although they encouraged Spark and her brother to pursue their own interests. \"My mother wrote a nice letter, that was all. My father read the racing papers. My mother, however, liked to play the piano and was a music teacher, so maybe I get the musical side and imagination from her.\" </p> <p>In 1957 when her first novel, The Comforters - an exploration of the mechanics of writing in which a woman hears the text of the book being narrated in her head - was published, Spark's parents were bemused. \"They didn't know what it was all about really,\" she says, giggling at the memory of her mother's startled reaction. \"'Oh darling!' she said. 'You've written a novel!' She didn't take it in.\" Spark, however, had never doubted that she would be a writer. At 11, she came under the influence of Miss Kay of James Gillespie's School in Edinburgh, a woman on whom the character of Miss Jean Brodie would eventually be based. Miss Kay taught Spark and her classmates that they were \"not to be carried away by crowd emotions, not to be fools,\" a lesson that Spark would remember and translate into the cool-headed, unsentimental slant of her own literature. </p> <p>Whilst still at school, five of her poems were accepted for an anthology, and at 14 she won first prize in a 1932 poetry competition to commemorate the death of Scott. \"The Border Ballads were a heavy influence on her,\" says Alan Taylor, man aging editor of the Scotsman and a frequent visitor to Spark's home in Tuscany. \"They have these summary ways of dispatching people and she does this all the time.\" </p> <p>\"I still take a poetic view of life as I see it through the novel\", says Spark, explaining that she views her novels as long prose poems, a claim that might inspire eye-rolling cynicism if it came from a less disciplined writer. Spark, however, refers not to the use of poetic language or to flowery imagery, but to the hard-boiled matter of rhythm and cadence. \"It is a question of construction, of lyricism - lyricism in that poetry has music in it. There are repetitive motifs; repetitive little phrases, themes, always returning and a complete reversal of circumstances towards the end.\" </p> <p>The repetitive motif beats time not only in her writing but in her speech. She has a talent for packaging statements in such a way that they have a theatrical momentum, a spontaneous rhythm and suspense that at once explains how she writes her novels in a single go, without returning to edit them. She punctuates her spoken word as exactly as her written. There is a full stop at the end of each statement that she indicates by staring into space and tuning out. She has it first time. </p> <p>She observes a writing routine that goes beyond strictness into the realm of superstition, pouring out each novel, in longhand, onto yellow note pads she buys from James Thin, the Edinburgh stationer. \"I have an absolute will to write,\" she says. This can leave the impression of a chilly character, a woman meticulous in her enthusiasms, who regards people as if they appear on the end of a pin. Critics have marked her as, \"cold\" and \"highly calculated\", a writer whose faculties, like a set of surgical instruments, ensure that \"every stitch is small and perfect\". </p> <p>\"She has a sense of humour but I don't think she has a sense of the ridiculous,\" says Iris Birtwistle. \"I've never heard her do a hearty laugh, ever. All her conversation is spiked with merriment, but in the old-fashioned way. I think the ridiculous would probably be lowbrow for her.\" </p> <p>\"I simply can't take the jocular,\" Spark has said, \"either in life or art. A well-brewed send-up is delightful. Derision is boring.\" Friends insist that her steely composure should not be mistaken for aloofness. \"She thinks before she speaks,\" says Auberon Waugh, whose father Evelyn was a great promoter of Spark's work before it became well known. \"But she is terribly warm, terribly affectionate.\" </p> <p>After leaving school, Spark wanted to go to university but the family couldn't afford it, so she enrolled on a course in pr\u00e9cis writing at Herriot Watt College (now university), a natural home for her writing style. \"I do like to be brief,\" she says. She didn't mope for her lack of a degree. It was regrettable, of course, but with her trademark defiance Spark did not feel it diminished her. \"I thought all the books of the world are open to me if I can get at them. I could read all that I wanted.\" </p> <p> The war hadn't yet started and as nice girls didn't have sex before marriage, Spark made the practical and hasty decision at 19 to get engaged to Sydney Oswald Spark - SOS as he was known - 13 years her senior, whom she had met at a dance and whose history was largely unknown to her. He was going to Rhodesia as a school teacher and, keen for adventure, she grabbed at the chance to go with him. They were married on September 3 1937. Within six months of arriving, she knew she had made a terrible mistake. Spark talks about this phase of her life with the same unblinking detachment she turns on everything: she is faintly amused, mildly astonished, forever precise and indignant at this, the crazy narrative of her 20s. </p> <p>\"My husband had an unbalanced family, and his sister had to go in a loony bin because she attempted to murder my mother. And then I realised that I had been taken in. But by that time I was expecting a baby.\" Spark was in a genuinely precarious position. When Nita McEwan's husband killed her in the boarding house, Spark was rattled enough to hide the gun that her own husband liked to wave around and occasionally point at her. </p> <p>And she hated the colony. \"The white people were not very nice,\" she says. \"There was a feeling of people coming in just to exploit and I felt uneasy and frightened. I could see this myriad of blacks against 50,000 whites who wouldn't have a chance if it came to a showdown. And I could see that it was wrong. It was their house, not ours.\" </p> <p>Her husband became more manic and increasingly more violent and when Spark eventually left him, two years into the marriage, he was committed to a mental institution. She tried to get passage home, but the second world war had broken out and there were no passenger ships sailing. \"I had to stick it out as much as possible, but it was all very much life and death for me.\" </p> <p>Throughout this time, she had not stopped writing. She twice won Rhodesia's annual poetry competition, and her appreciation for a strong narrative made her desperate to return to Britain to experience the war. She enrolled Robin, then five, in a convent in Rhodesia, and eventually sailed for England, not a decision she regrets, she says, because there was little alternative. </p> <p>\"There was almost no work for me to do there. I thought the war would be over in six months. Instead it was 18 months. It was quite a separation.\" Friends have since raised eyebrows and muttered that she is not very maternal, that writing always came before her son, who she never quite seemed to identify with. </p> <p>When Robin returned from Rhodesia, he went to live with his maternal grandparents in Edinburgh and decided, as a teenager, to embrace his grandfather's religion, Judaism. As an adult, he started campaigning for his late grandmother (Muriel's mother) to be recognised as a Jew, a cause taken up, to Muriel Spark's immense annoyance, by the Jewish Chronicle. \"They are really like hounds,\" she says. \"Absolute hounds.\" What is at least probable, in this pedantic and irritable dispute, is that her mother, Sarah Uezzel, signed a false Jewish name on her wedding certificate in order to be allowed to marry Spark's father in a synagogue. </p> <p>Spark is at her haughtiest, her uncrushable best on this, the subject of her own contested heritage. \"The very strict Jews such as those at the Jewish Chronicle refuse the word half-Jew altogether, which is, of course, in the dictionary. One knows what half-Jew means. Hitler didn't care one damn what the Jews' definition was.\" She pauses. \"They say there is no such thing as a half-Jew and I say there is, because I experienced it.\" </p> <p>There is a sense that this episode infuriated Spark less for its content than for what it did to her perception of Robin: that he appeared feeble to her, relying for his identity on some bogus interpretation of his ethnic background rather than his own convictions; that he was not like his mother at all. </p> <p>Spark's own religious convictions were cemented in 1954 when she converted to Catholicism, a faith she practises, like all things, on her own terms. She is anti-clerical, dislikes dogma and will not remain silent on church matters she finds absurd. She doesn't believe in good and evil, but in absurdity and intelligence - in the fact that people who do \"evil\" acts are pursuing a logic that intelligent people call absurd. \"I like to speak out,\" she says. \"If the Catholic religion, to which I belong, can't allow me to speak out frankly, it is no religion for me.\" </p> <p>Her reasons for converting are deeply embedded in her prose. She speaks of the importance of recognising a \"life beyond this life,\" of acknowledging the supernatural and, in a rare concession to poetic fancy, of believing in angels. \"I do think the whole of nature is impregnated with spiritual life. There is no substance without some spirit and no spirit without substance. \" </p> <p>It is possible that as a writer, she was attracted to Catholicism for its strong narrative, its seductive ritu als and repetitive motifs, the sheer theatrical force of its history. It is also possible, as Auberon Waugh observes, that Spark's mental filing system required a repository of faith. \"The thing about Catholicism,\" he says, \"is that there's no bloody nonsense - something is right, something is wrong.\" </p> <p>After she returned to London, Spark fulfilled her wish to \"see\" the war, by working as a duty secretary at a military intelligence base in Milton Bryan, Bedfordshire, taking down telephone messages from allied bombing crews and passing them on for use as black propaganda. It was not until after the war that she started writing in earnest, for a jewellery trade magazine called Argentor, a political magazine called European Affairs, and, after distinguishing herself in a number of its competitions, as editor of the Poetry Review. She was 29, and determined to rescue the magazine from ignominy as a forum for weak and vain poetry. </p> <p>\"I started publishing modern poems rather than Christmas card-type poems,\" she sniffs and, not shy to admit it, she made enough enemies to be dismissed from the post after two years of constant assault from lecherous board members and bitter poets. \"They would do anything to get published. Those that weren't queer wanted to sleep with me. They thought they were poets and there should be free love or something. I've never known anything like it.\" </p> <p>Spark's friendship with Penelope Jardine has since provoked speculations about her own sexuality, although both she and her friends reject them as fanciful. \"She had enormous vitality and great appeal to the opposite sex,\" says Iris Birtwistle. \"We had masses of boyfriends, and why not?\" Theirs is an old-fashioned friendship, Spark says, although one that has evolved into a peculiar intensity. \"Penelope is like the archetypal novelist's wife,\" says John Mortimer, who rents a summer house near their home. \"She is protective of Muriel.\" </p> <p>Spark's stint at the Poetry Review gained her a reputation as a stylish editor and she built on it with her biographies of Mary Shelley (1951) and Emily Bronte (1953). The real break, however, came on November 5 1951, when she entered a short story competition in the Observer. The subject was \"Christmas\" and the prize \u00a3250, big enough to attract 6,700 entries. Spark was 33, renting a room in London's Old Brompton Road and earning \u00a3134 a year as a jobbing writer - of poetry, journalism and speech material on industrial relations, a subject about which she knew nothing but, with her customary flair, managed to pull off. </p> <p>\"It was on a Saturday that I finished writing the short story,\" she recalls, in a polished anecdote. \"I was going to type it out and I found that I had no typing paper, and all the shops were shut except for one, a picture framer's. And so I said to him, 'Just give me 20 pieces of paper, that's all I want'. He said, 'I don't sell paper'. I said, 'I can see you've got a typewriter there, I just want paper'. I said 'I'm going to go in for this prize and if I win it I'll buy a picture off you'.\" She smiles sardonically. \"I bought a picture.\" </p> <p>The success of the story, The Seraph And The Zambesi, based on her time in Rhodesia, prompted a commission for a novel from Macmillan. Spark, still desperately poor, was only able to write it thanks to the patronage of a kindly Grahame Greene. He had read and admired her non-fiction and, learning from her boyfriend, the critic and literary schmoozer Derek Stanford, that she was poor, offered to pay her an allowance. </p> <p>Iris Birtwistle was one of the first people Spark knew intimately to have come from a background of private means. \"She was quite intrigued by it,\" Birtwistle says. \"She was hooked on class, fascinated by the structure and interplay.\" </p> <p>\"She has ideas of grandeur,\" says Auberon Waugh. \"She has to be driven in a car everywhere.\" She is acutely interested in the dynamics of snobbery, a subject that she examines in the novel she is currently writing. It will be called The Finishing School and she is reading DeBrett's peerage and a book on social manners for it, which she finds \"killingly funny\". Spark's own social position changed radically, not with the publication of her first novel - which was generally well received but didn't make her fortune - but with the success of The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie, the fictional schoolteacher who incinerates her enemies with a sharp tongue. </p> <p>That 1961 hit was the turning point for Spark; William Shawn, then editor of the New Yorker, printed the entire manuscript of Jean Brodie in one issue of the magazine and offered Spark the use of an office overlooking Times Square. She took up his offer in 1963 when she moved to New York and, with the stage and film versions of Jean Brodie bringing her international acclaim, started knocking around the celebrity circuit with Norman Mailer and Mary McCarthy. </p> <p>This is the glamorous period, full of parties and salons, which she revelled in, briefly, before shunning it to get back to writing. Even during the headiest days, however, she remained sceptical of Hollywood's interest in her and is critical of all the film versions of her work, considering Geraldine McEwan in the stage version to have been the best Jean Brodie. \"The colours in the film [dir. Ronald Neame, 1969] were much too bright for Edinburgh, which has a sort of pearly light. And everyone's hair was too red. Apart from that, I thought it quite well written.\" It tickles her however, that all the actresses who have been in dramatisations of her books have become dames: Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Vanessa Redgrave, Elizabeth Taylor and Spark herself, in 1993. \"We are all dames together,\" she says and smiles. </p> <p>The attention didn't change her; in fact, the moment the publicity circus threatened to interfere with her writing she fled, from London to New York, New York to Rome and finally to Arezzo. \"She has made a career of escaping when she thinks something is going to stop her writing,\" says Alan Taylor. </p> <p>To Spark, everything comes second to the story: sons, lovers, health and welfare. She gets up at seven every morning to write, aware in that unflinching way of hers that every novel might be her last. \"When I begin a novel, I want to absorb it through my pores,\" she says, and this is apparent in the words that she uses, in the tiny shifts in temperature she records. Her defiance is in her detail, her precision driven by the knowledge that by fixing things exactly, we widen their possibility. </p> <p>The novel she has just submitted is called Aiding And Abetting, a fictional account of what happened to Lord Lucan after he murdered the family nanny. (There are a few legal wrangles to negotiate, although Spark, poised as if at the head of an army, declares \"let him come forward and sue me\".) </p> <p>It is part of her resilience that she finds dramatic potential in everything. At the end of the interview, she is asked if she would mind being photographed outside in a gale. Spark bobs about in huge red hockey socks and yellow anorak, blinking gamely into the wind, throwing her bird-like frame against the elements with a wicked smile. It might be that she is content to suffer a little discomfort for the story she will tell when the door shuts behind her. </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance</strong></p> <p>Muriel Sarah Spark</p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> February 1 1918, Edinburgh. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> James Gillespie's school for girls, Edinburgh; Heriot Watt College. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1937, Sydney Oswald Spark (one son, Robin), dissolved. </p> <p><strong> Employment: </strong> 1944 Foreign Office; 1947-9 general secretary, Poetry Society, editor, Poetry Review. </p> <p><strong> Some fiction:</strong> 1957 The Comforters; 1958 The Go-Away Bird; 1959 Memento Mori; 1960 The Ballad Of Peckham Rye; 1961 The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie; 1963 The Girls Of Slender Means; 1965 The Mandelbaum Gate; 1974 The Abbess Of Crewe; 1981 Loitering With Intent; 1988 A Far Cry From Kensington; 1996 Reality And Dreams. </p> <p><strong> Some non-fiction:</strong> 1952 Child Of Light: A Reassessment Of Mary Shelley; 1992 Curriculum Vitae (autobiography). </p> <p><strong> Honours:</strong> 1993 Dame of the British Empire. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Aiding And Abetting will be published by Penguin in September.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For half a century Muriel Spark has been stripping away human vanity with the force of a blowtorch. \"You will end up as a girl-guide leader in a suburb like Corstorphine,\" withers Jean Brodie, Spark's most famous heroine, to one of her young charges. And her now infamous demolition of Marie Stopes, an adversary during Spark's time as editor of the Poetry Review, vibrates with her signature tone: \"I used to think it a pity that her mother rather than she had not thought of birth control,\" Spark said, with an irony so delicate there is no sound of tearing as the knife goes in. Because of this, her polite curiosity comes across in conversation as a front for more ruthless operations; her generous manner as a ruse to draw out pretensions. Naturally, this is absurd. Now 82, she sits in her study in Tuscany with her wicked red hair and her merry eyes, the very incarnation of her novels: quick, compact, like a sparrow with its head to one side, prospecting for worms. She smiles, revealing small white teeth, perfectly cut. \"Now,\" she says, after dispensing with preliminaries, \"what is it you are wearing?\" She has lived here, an hour from Florence, for the last 20 years. It is not an idyllic hideaway in Tuscany's New Labour belt, but a dark, crumbling presbytery conversion on a hilltop outside Arezzo, an industrial town where the outlying villages are one generation removed from poverty. It is a fitting backdrop for a woman to whom dark and dramatic things seem to happen, or at least, who presents them as such in the retelling. Over the last decade, five of Spark's pet dogs have been poisoned, in a case that made the front page of the Italian newspapers. \"Who killed Muriel's dogs?\" demanded La Repubblica last March, while Spark rallied international attention and sealed her reputation among locals as a \"mad Englishwoman\". Back in 1939, Nita McEwen, an old school friend to whom she bore a striking resemblance, was shot dead in a boarding house in Rhodesia. Spark, boarding there also, entered the sitting room the following day and was perceived, amid much screaming, to be the ghost of the dead woman. Perhaps to protect herself from these bizarre confrontations, Spark derives a brittle energy working them into her fiction and consoling herself with the belief that, as John Masefield once told her, \"all experience is good for the artist\". It is possible that she welcomes a good fight as fuel for her eloquence; she is at her finest when under siege. For the last three years, she has maintained a high-profile dispute with her son, Robin, in which she has referred to him as a \"lousy\" artist, consumed by \"jealousy and resentment\". There may be some teasing in this, not of Robin, but of the pious observers to whom displays of \"bad motherhood\" are kindling for moral outrage. Nonetheless, friends wince at her forthrightness and she is reputed to be \"difficult\", infuriated by sloppy reasoning and poised, cat-like, to strike at anyone who subjects her to it, even her own son. She is not a woman restrained by sentiment. This is not to say she is without close friends. She shares her home with its owner, Penelope Jardine, a sculptor who has been her companion and assistant since they met in Rome in the 1960s and is, like Spark, a person to whom the sinister has a full-bodied presence in daily life. When Jardine lived in London, she was troubled by a man who persistently called her flat asking to be put in touch with the previous occupant. \"It was plain from the questions he asked that he was intending to rub him out,\" she says over tea. This is exactly the kind of scenario that Spark swoops on for her fiction: the hitman on the phone, the diamond smuggler down the street, the vast improbability that forces the reader to reassess, mid-flow, what kind of book he is dealing with. Spark is equally disorienting in person: \"I had my bag stolen from the back of my chair in a restaurant in Florence,\" she recalls. \"It had an unfinished poem about a hat in it. When I went to the police, they asked me what was in the bag, and I said, there was a poem. The policeman said can you describe the poem? I said, it was about a hat. I didn't get the feeling he took it seriously at all.\" Not taking Spark seriously is an error that critics have been sporadically making since her first novel, The Comforters, was published in 1957. \"Brief, brittle and nasty in an arch kind of way,\" the critic Robert Nye wrote of her in 1971. A bad-tempered review of The Hothouse By The East River in 1973 called it \"elliptical and dotty\". In 1992 when her autobiography, Curriculum Vitae, was submitted for publication in America, word reached Spark that one of the editors had condemned it as \"so full of calculated madness\" that they couldn't publish. Spark was swift in her assassination. \"I said, 'She has dedicated her menopause to me'. I left it at that.\" The huffy reviews were possibly provoked by Spark's talent for toying with her readers' expectations. It is an approach she occasionally takes too far: at the end of Hothouse, readers discover with a dizzy plunge that all the protagonists are dead and have been since the opening page. The characters in a Spark novel are held within a symbolic order that is not altogether reliable. \"What made her fiction in the 60s very important and exhilarating is that she seemed to have found a way of making it new,\" says David Lodge, the novelist and academic who numbers Spark among the most influential of the post-war novelists. \"She uses the omniscient authorial voice, not as it appears in the classical novel, but in a very playful, whimsical, unexpected way, jerking the reader about on the end of a string. The first time I read Jean Brodie, I was baffled. The technique has become familiar now, but at the time it seemed extraordinary.\" \"There is an intellectual energy that is staggering and touching and amazing,\" says Iris Birtwistle, the poet, whose work Spark first published in the Poetry Review. \"She carves with a very sharp knife. Muriel Spark was the keenest, sharpest, most agile brain that I ever came across. She is light years more intelligent than most people.\" THE greatest non-sequitur pulled off by Muriel Spark has been that of her own life. She knew that she wanted to write and she knew how she wanted to write, but it was many years before she was in a financial position to do anything beyond getting by. From the outset, however, she had a sort of damn-you self-assurance that kept her from editing her style to suit publishers' fancies. \"I was very much myself,\" she says. \"I felt I should be getting as much money as people like Kingsley Amis, who was my contemporary.\" Spark, however, was from a background quite at odds with the tenor of her prose - that glittering levity enabled by not having to worry about paying the gas bill. \"I had a certain throw-away attitude which really didn't belong to my upbringing. I had to adapt it to a life that was totally different from that of the people who had used that kind of prose style before. It usually belonged to people of leisure and I had always had to struggle.\" She was born Muriel Camberg in Edinburgh in 1918, to a Scots-Jewish father and an English mother, a fact that her own son, Robin, would contest 70 years later in a bid to vindicate his own religious choices by claiming that both his grandparents were Jewish. \"My mother and father were both religious,\" says Spark. \"But not along any sectarian line. They believed in the Almighty.\" Her confidence in her own talent was formidable. As a child she liked reading Sir Walter Scott's Border Ballads and eavesdropping on adult conversations, both of which stimulated what she later called, her \"literary sense\", a highly-tuned ear for language. Her precocious interest in literature (she was reading Browning and Swinburne at 11) was not shared by her parents, an engineer and a music teacher, although they encouraged Spark and her brother to pursue their own interests. \"My mother wrote a nice letter, that was all. My father read the racing papers. My mother, however, liked to play the piano and was a music teacher, so maybe I get the musical side and imagination from her.\" In 1957 when her first novel, The Comforters - an exploration of the mechanics of writing in which a woman hears the text of the book being narrated in her head - was published, Spark's parents were bemused. \"They didn't know what it was all about really,\" she says, giggling at the memory of her mother's startled reaction. \"'Oh darling!' she said. 'You've written a novel!' She didn't take it in.\" Spark, however, had never doubted that she would be a writer. At 11, she came under the influence of Miss Kay of James Gillespie's School in Edinburgh, a woman on whom the character of Miss Jean Brodie would eventually be based. Miss Kay taught Spark and her classmates that they were \"not to be carried away by crowd emotions, not to be fools,\" a lesson that Spark would remember and translate into the cool-headed, unsentimental slant of her own literature. Whilst still at school, five of her poems were accepted for an anthology, and at 14 she won first prize in a 1932 poetry competition to commemorate the death of Scott. \"The Border Ballads were a heavy influence on her,\" says Alan Taylor, man aging editor of the Scotsman and a frequent visitor to Spark's home in Tuscany. \"They have these summary ways of dispatching people and she does this all the time.\" \"I still take a poetic view of life as I see it through the novel\", says Spark, explaining that she views her novels as long prose poems, a claim that might inspire eye-rolling cynicism if it came from a less disciplined writer. Spark, however, refers not to the use of poetic language or to flowery imagery, but to the hard-boiled matter of rhythm and cadence. \"It is a question of construction, of lyricism - lyricism in that poetry has music in it. There are repetitive motifs; repetitive little phrases, themes, always returning and a complete reversal of circumstances towards the end.\" The repetitive motif beats time not only in her writing but in her speech. She has a talent for packaging statements in such a way that they have a theatrical momentum, a spontaneous rhythm and suspense that at once explains how she writes her novels in a single go, without returning to edit them. She punctuates her spoken word as exactly as her written. There is a full stop at the end of each statement that she indicates by staring into space and tuning out. She has it first time. She observes a writing routine that goes beyond strictness into the realm of superstition, pouring out each novel, in longhand, onto yellow note pads she buys from James Thin, the Edinburgh stationer. \"I have an absolute will to write,\" she says. This can leave the impression of a chilly character, a woman meticulous in her enthusiasms, who regards people as if they appear on the end of a pin. Critics have marked her as, \"cold\" and \"highly calculated\", a writer whose faculties, like a set of surgical instruments, ensure that \"every stitch is small and perfect\". \"She has a sense of humour but I don't think she has a sense of the ridiculous,\" says Iris Birtwistle. \"I've never heard her do a hearty laugh, ever. All her conversation is spiked with merriment, but in the old-fashioned way. I think the ridiculous would probably be lowbrow for her.\" \"I simply can't take the jocular,\" Spark has said, \"either in life or art. A well-brewed send-up is delightful. Derision is boring.\" Friends insist that her steely composure should not be mistaken for aloofness. \"She thinks before she speaks,\" says Auberon Waugh, whose father Evelyn was a great promoter of Spark's work before it became well known. \"But she is terribly warm, terribly affectionate.\" After leaving school, Spark wanted to go to university but the family couldn't afford it, so she enrolled on a course in pr\u00e9cis writing at Herriot Watt College (now university), a natural home for her writing style. \"I do like to be brief,\" she says. She didn't mope for her lack of a degree. It was regrettable, of course, but with her trademark defiance Spark did not feel it diminished her. \"I thought all the books of the world are open to me if I can get at them. I could read all that I wanted.\" The war hadn't yet started and as nice girls didn't have sex before marriage, Spark made the practical and hasty decision at 19 to get engaged to Sydney Oswald Spark - SOS as he was known - 13 years her senior, whom she had met at a dance and whose history was largely unknown to her. He was going to Rhodesia as a school teacher and, keen for adventure, she grabbed at the chance to go with him. They were married on September 3 1937. Within six months of arriving, she knew she had made a terrible mistake. Spark talks about this phase of her life with the same unblinking detachment she turns on everything: she is faintly amused, mildly astonished, forever precise and indignant at this, the crazy narrative of her 20s. \"My husband had an unbalanced family, and his sister had to go in a loony bin because she attempted to murder my mother. And then I realised that I had been taken in. But by that time I was expecting a baby.\" Spark was in a genuinely precarious position. When Nita McEwan's husband killed her in the boarding house, Spark was rattled enough to hide the gun that her own husband liked to wave around and occasionally point at her. And she hated the colony. \"The white people were not very nice,\" she says. \"There was a feeling of people coming in just to exploit and I felt uneasy and frightened. I could see this myriad of blacks against 50,000 whites who wouldn't have a chance if it came to a showdown. And I could see that it was wrong. It was their house, not ours.\" Her husband became more manic and increasingly more violent and when Spark eventually left him, two years into the marriage, he was committed to a mental institution. She tried to get passage home, but the second world war had broken out and there were no passenger ships sailing. \"I had to stick it out as much as possible, but it was all very much life and death for me.\" Throughout this time, she had not stopped writing. She twice won Rhodesia's annual poetry competition, and her appreciation for a strong narrative made her desperate to return to Britain to experience the war.

It was quite a separation.\" Friends have since raised eyebrows and muttered that she is not very maternal, that writing always came before her son, who she never quite seemed to identify with. When Robin returned from Rhodesia, he went to live with his maternal grandparents in Edinburgh and decided, as a teenager, to embrace his grandfather's religion, Judaism. As an adult, he started campaigning for his late grandmother (Muriel's mother) to be recognised as a Jew, a cause taken up, to Muriel Spark's immense annoyance, by the Jewish Chronicle. \"They are really like hounds,\" she says. \"Absolute hounds.\" What is at least probable, in this pedantic and irritable dispute, is that her mother, Sarah Uezzel, signed a false Jewish name on her wedding certificate in order to be allowed to marry Spark's father in a synagogue. Spark is at her haughtiest, her uncrushable best on this, the subject of her own contested heritage. \"The very strict Jews such as those at the Jewish Chronicle refuse the word half-Jew altogether, which is, of course, in the dictionary. One knows what half-Jew means. Hitler didn't care one damn what the Jews' definition was.\" She pauses. \"They say there is no such thing as a half-Jew and I say there is, because I experienced it.\" There is a sense that this episode infuriated Spark less for its content than for what it did to her perception of Robin: that he appeared feeble to her, relying for his identity on some bogus interpretation of his ethnic background rather than his own convictions; that he was not like his mother at all. Spark's own religious convictions were cemented in 1954 when she converted to Catholicism, a faith she practises, like all things, on her own terms. She is anti-clerical, dislikes dogma and will not remain silent on church matters she finds absurd. She doesn't believe in good and evil, but in absurdity and intelligence - in the fact that people who do \"evil\" acts are pursuing a logic that intelligent people call absurd. \"I like to speak out,\" she says. \"If the Catholic religion, to which I belong, can't allow me to speak out frankly, it is no religion for me.\" Her reasons for converting are deeply embedded in her prose. She speaks of the importance of recognising a \"life beyond this life,\" of acknowledging the supernatural and, in a rare concession to poetic fancy, of believing in angels. \"I do think the whole of nature is impregnated with spiritual life. There is no substance without some spirit and no spirit without substance. \" It is possible that as a writer, she was attracted to Catholicism for its strong narrative, its seductive ritu als and repetitive motifs, the sheer theatrical force of its history. It is also possible, as Auberon Waugh observes, that Spark's mental filing system required a repository of faith. \"The thing about Catholicism,\" he says, \"is that there's no bloody nonsense - something is right, something is wrong.\" After she returned to London, Spark fulfilled her wish to \"see\" the war, by working as a duty secretary at a military intelligence base in Milton Bryan, Bedfordshire, taking down telephone messages from allied bombing crews and passing them on for use as black propaganda. It was not until after the war that she started writing in earnest, for a jewellery trade magazine called Argentor, a political magazine called European Affairs, and, after distinguishing herself in a number of its competitions, as editor of the Poetry Review. She was 29, and determined to rescue the magazine from ignominy as a forum for weak and vain poetry. \"I started publishing modern poems rather than Christmas card-type poems,\" she sniffs and, not shy to admit it, she made enough enemies to be dismissed from the post after two years of constant assault from lecherous board members and bitter poets. \"They would do anything to get published. Those that weren't queer wanted to sleep with me. They thought they were poets and there should be free love or something. I've never known anything like it.\" Spark's friendship with Penelope Jardine has since provoked speculations about her own sexuality, although both she and her friends reject them as fanciful. \"She had enormous vitality and great appeal to the opposite sex,\" says Iris Birtwistle. \"We had masses of boyfriends, and why not?\" Theirs is an old-fashioned friendship, Spark says, although one that has evolved into a peculiar intensity. \"Penelope is like the archetypal novelist's wife,\" says John Mortimer, who rents a summer house near their home. \"She is protective of Muriel.\" Spark's stint at the Poetry Review gained her a reputation as a stylish editor and she built on it with her biographies of Mary Shelley (1951) and Emily Bronte (1953). The real break, however, came on November 5 1951, when she entered a short story competition in the Observer. The subject was \"Christmas\" and the prize \u00a3250, big enough to attract 6,700 entries. Spark was 33, renting a room in London's Old Brompton Road and earning \u00a3134 a year as a jobbing writer - of poetry, journalism and speech material on industrial relations, a subject about which she knew nothing but, with her customary flair, managed to pull off. \"It was on a Saturday that I finished writing the short story,\" she recalls, in a polished anecdote. \"I was going to type it out and I found that I had no typing paper, and all the shops were shut except for one, a picture framer's. And so I said to him, 'Just give me 20 pieces of paper, that's all I want'. He said, 'I don't sell paper'. I said, 'I can see you've got a typewriter there, I just want paper'. I said 'I'm going to go in for this prize and if I win it I'll buy a picture off you'.\" She smiles sardonically. \"I bought a picture.\" The success of the story, The Seraph And The Zambesi, based on her time in Rhodesia, prompted a commission for a novel from Macmillan. Spark, still desperately poor, was only able to write it thanks to the patronage of a kindly Grahame Greene. He had read and admired her non-fiction and, learning from her boyfriend, the critic and literary schmoozer Derek Stanford, that she was poor, offered to pay her an allowance. Iris Birtwistle was one of the first people Spark knew intimately to have come from a background of private means. \"She was quite intrigued by it,\" Birtwistle says. \"She was hooked on class, fascinated by the structure and interplay.\" \"She has ideas of grandeur,\" says Auberon Waugh. \"She has to be driven in a car everywhere.\" She is acutely interested in the dynamics of snobbery, a subject that she examines in the novel she is currently writing. It will be called The Finishing School and she is reading DeBrett's peerage and a book on social manners for it, which she finds \"killingly funny\". Spark's own social position changed radically, not with the publication of her first novel - which was generally well received but didn't make her fortune - but with the success of The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie, the fictional schoolteacher who incinerates her enemies with a sharp tongue. That 1961 hit was the turning point for Spark; William Shawn, then editor of the New Yorker, printed the entire manuscript of Jean Brodie in one issue of the magazine and offered Spark the use of an office overlooking Times Square. She took up his offer in 1963 when she moved to New York and, with the stage and film versions of Jean Brodie bringing her international acclaim, started knocking around the celebrity circuit with Norman Mailer and Mary McCarthy. This is the glamorous period, full of parties and salons, which she revelled in, briefly, before shunning it to get back to writing. Even during the headiest days, however, she remained sceptical of Hollywood's interest in her and is critical of all the film versions of her work, considering Geraldine McEwan in the stage version to have been the best Jean Brodie. \"The colours in the film [dir. Ronald Neame, 1969] were much too bright for Edinburgh, which has a sort of pearly light. And everyone's hair was too red. Apart from that, I thought it quite well written.\" It tickles her however, that all the actresses who have been in dramatisations of her books have become dames: Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Vanessa Redgrave, Elizabeth Taylor and Spark herself, in 1993. \"We are all dames together,\" she says and smiles. The attention didn't change her; in fact, the moment the publicity circus threatened to interfere with her writing she fled, from London to New York, New York to Rome and finally to Arezzo. \"She has made a career of escaping when she thinks something is going to stop her writing,\" says Alan Taylor. To Spark, everything comes second to the story: sons, lovers, health and welfare. She gets up at seven every morning to write, aware in that unflinching way of hers that every novel might be her last. \"When I begin a novel, I want to absorb it through my pores,\" she says, and this is apparent in the words that she uses, in the tiny shifts in temperature she records. Her defiance is in her detail, her precision driven by the knowledge that by fixing things exactly, we widen their possibility. The novel she has just submitted is called Aiding And Abetting, a fictional account of what happened to Lord Lucan after he murdered the family nanny. (There are a few legal wrangles to negotiate, although Spark, poised as if at the head of an army, declares \"let him come forward and sue me\".) It is part of her resilience that she finds dramatic potential in everything. At the end of the interview, she is asked if she would mind being photographed outside in a gale. Spark bobs about in huge red hockey socks and yellow anorak, blinking gamely into the wind, throwing her bird-like frame against the elements with a wicked smile. It might be that she is content to suffer a little discomfort for the story she will tell when the door shuts behind her. Life at a glance Muriel Sarah Spark Born: February 1 1918, Edinburgh.

      "body": "<p>'Oh, come on,\" I said to Drummond. \"Can't we do a bit better than 'It's good'?\"</p> <p>He prodded at the roast cod on its bolster of truffle mash with its sauce of a reduction of balsamic vinegar zig-zagging like a mountain road all over the plate. 'Texture . . .\" he said at length. \"The texture is just right. And texture is very important.\" That was it. Oh well.</p> <p>Cod. Truffle. Mash. Balsamic. It's a litany of what's been moving and shaking around the capital's kitchens for some time, a mantra of high and medium fashion. Well, who's to say that they don't taste nice when they fall into talented hands?</p> <p>It has been agreed for some time that the hands of Jean Christophe Novelli are awash with talent. The man, it was generally said, can cook - even if, at one time, you weren't quite sure where he was cooking. He was here, there and everywhere. Hardly a week went by without another outpost of the Novelli catering empire opening up, or so it seemed, with the books, the articles, the TV appearances filling in the bits between. It was wall-to-wall JCN.</p> <p>Then came - what shall we say? - a period of readjustment. It seems, perhaps, that Jean Christophe did not have the same flair for high finance as he does for haute cuisine. Hubris took a hand. He abandoned the takeover/makeover trail, sold off the outposts of empire, and retreated to the kitchens of his original, highly-praised enterprise, Maison Novelli on Clerkenwell Green, along with some of his longer-serving team, and that's where you find him now.</p> <p>I reviewed it when it first opened a few years back, and generally liked what I found, particularly in the cheaper, simpler brasserie on the ground floor. The higher-flying cooking in the dining room on the first floor was confident, rococo stuff, a bit convoluted and rich for my taste, although undoubtedly individual, bouncing with flavours, and carried off with the flair of the supremely confident.</p> <p>Anyway, having followed the ups and downs of JCN's Hale-Bopp path, I went along to Maison Novelli to see if style or substance had changed as a result of his experiences. Actually, that's not quite true. I had already dropped by for lunch, just to see how things were getting on, and was agreeably surprised.

      "bodyText": "'Oh, come on,\" I said to Drummond. \"Can't we do a bit better than 'It's good'?\" He prodded at the roast cod on its bolster of truffle mash with its sauce of a reduction of balsamic vinegar zig-zagging like a mountain road all over the plate. 'Texture . . .\" he said at length. \"The texture is just right. And texture is very important.\" That was it. Oh well. Cod. Truffle. Mash. Balsamic. It's a litany of what's been moving and shaking around the capital's kitchens for some time, a mantra of high and medium fashion. Well, who's to say that they don't taste nice when they fall into talented hands? It has been agreed for some time that the hands of Jean Christophe Novelli are awash with talent. The man, it was generally said, can cook - even if, at one time, you weren't quite sure where he was cooking. He was here, there and everywhere. Hardly a week went by without another outpost of the Novelli catering empire opening up, or so it seemed, with the books, the articles, the TV appearances filling in the bits between. It was wall-to-wall JCN. Then came - what shall we say? - a period of readjustment. It seems, perhaps, that Jean Christophe did not have the same flair for high finance as he does for haute cuisine. Hubris took a hand. He abandoned the takeover/makeover trail, sold off the outposts of empire, and retreated to the kitchens of his original, highly-praised enterprise, Maison Novelli on Clerkenwell Green, along with some of his longer-serving team, and that's where you find him now. I reviewed it when it first opened a few years back, and generally liked what I found, particularly in the cheaper, simpler brasserie on the ground floor. The higher-flying cooking in the dining room on the first floor was confident, rococo stuff, a bit convoluted and rich for my taste, although undoubtedly individual, bouncing with flavours, and carried off with the flair of the supremely confident. Anyway, having followed the ups and downs of JCN's Hale-Bopp path, I went along to Maison Novelli to see if style or substance had changed as a result of his experiences. Actually, that's not quite true. I had already dropped by for lunch, just to see how things were getting on, and was agreeably surprised. Gloriana, with whom I had dined on that day, is a stern vegetarian, and was pretty bowled over by her unmeated dishes; two first courses, as it happens. Two first courses may seem a little on the light side, but mingy portions have never been one of JCN's faults.

The figures show that for every \u00a31 that a woman worker earns, her male counterpart is paid \u00a31.20. The gap is even wider for part-time workers, where the differential in male and female wages is 40%. \"Women workers have put up with poor pay because of institutionalised discrimination and the fact that society has traditionally undervalued the kind of work they do,\" commented general secretary John Monks. Goodness gracious me! Hundreds of budding Asian artists turned up at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in response to CreAsia 2000, an event to uncover the next generation of Asian talent. The bash, organised by the talent and skills charity, TS2k with Asian Business Initiative (ABi ), was backed by the government. TS2k is a talent and skills charity which runs Enterprise Centres in Brixton and Shadwell, where it offers free training courses covering a variety of areas including TV and film production, journalism, performance arts, website design and music. \u0095 For more information about future events and courses check out www.ts2k.org.uk, or visit the CreAsia 2000 site at www.creasia2000.co.uk. Xebec McGraw-Hill, the interactive teaching outfit, is hosting free seminars for human resources professionals responsible for organising in-house training projects. The seminars will explain the benefits of online learning and the practicalities of getting started, developing a business case, creating an effective desktop learning environment and supporting learners. Delegates can test drive any of its 140 online courses. For booking details and venues call Suzanne Staddon on 01453-837641.",

Remarks made by the commission president, Romano Prodi, in a recent interview in which he suggested it might be an option had, it said, been a complete misunderstanding and taken out of context. Mr Prodi is quoted in an interview with the Eurosceptic Spectator magazine as saying that Britain could abandon the single currency after joining and still remain a member of the EU under \"exceptional circumstances\". His words have been interpreted as an attempt to turn the hostile tide of UK public opinion by floating the possibility of a euro \"get-out clause\" but that now seems not to be the case. The commission yesterday did not try to disown Mr Prodi's controversial remarks but argued instead that \"a misunderstanding of language\" had occurred.

The episode is certain, however, to damage Mr Prodi who has been accused of being gaffe-prone and naive. In June of last year the euro took a beating on foreign exchange markets after Mr Prodi raised the spectre of Italy being forced to pull out of the euro. He later claimed to have been \"misinterpreted\" and said he did not believe Italy's future within the single currency zone was in question. He is reported to have made similar comments about Denmark which, together with Sweden, Greece and the UK, is outside the euro area. He courted controversy at the end of last year by inviting the Libyan president, Muammar Gadafy, to visit EU headquarters in Brussels ahead of the Lockerbie trial in the Netherlands. EU member states were irked that he had not consulted them. Earlier this month Mr Prodi effectively sacked his official spokesman after months of media criticism. The commission claimed yesterday that Mr Prodi had chosen his words in the Spectator with \"great care\".",

In 1991, they paid \u00a369,000 for the site near the centre of Southwell, a small town with a Norman minster and a racecourse, 15 miles from Nottingham University, where they were readers in green architecture. In 1996, the Vales took up posts at the University of Auckland, but a copy of their latest book, The New Autonomous House, is lying on the Croakers' coffee table. Note the word \"new\". It was as long ago as 1975 that the Vales published their first work on the subject, a substantial manifesto offering suggestions for building houses that don't pollute the earth or squander its resources. Nearly 20 years on, they set out to put their theories into practice.</p> <p>The new book is an account of how they did it. The house is the result. It's a building that fits in with the surrounding red-brick-and-tile vernacular, yet is fundamentally different from its neighbours insofar as it has the means to produce power from the sun, facilities to collect and store the rain, as well as a sewerage system based on recycling.</p> <p>David Croaker knew nothing of this when he called round one evening last year to pick up his eight-year-old daughter, Meredith, from the home of a friend, Katie Barker. But he was intrigued by the unusual internal appearance of the house - the abundance of unvarnished pine surfaces, the downstairs bathrooms, the whitewashed walls and the stainless-steel pipes conveying heat upwards and ventilation down. Katie's parents gave him a guided tour after revealing that, like the Vales, they would soon be moving on to take up posts elsewhere.</p> <p>At that time, the Croakers had been in England just a few months. David is a surgeon in Nottingham; Helen, a GP back home, is working part-time as a senior hospital house officer. They have another home close to the centre of Sydney, and 1,200 acres in rural New South Wales. In Southwell, they were renting a 70s estate house. \"It was perfectly functional, but it lacked any character,\" says Helen.</p> <p>Her husband liked the distinctive character of the Autonomous House as soon as he stepped over the threshold. \"When I was told about the self-sufficiency aspect, I thought it sounded like a bit of fun,\" he recalls, dryly. He's keen to stress, however, that living here is not a \"hair-shirt existence\" of toil and drudgery. But nor does he wish to sound flippant about the damage caused by the vast majority of us who don't live in environmentally-friendly homes such as this. Pointing to the CFC-free fridge bequeathed by the Vales and the Barkers, he says, \"There's no doubt in my mind of the effect that 6,000 million people are having on this planet. An ice sheet the size of Wales has broken away and is floating towards Argentina as we speak.\"</p> <p>The Croakers moved in last August, fully briefed on their responsibilities not just in the house, but also in what remained of the large, ancient garden where it was built. Southwell is the birthplace of the Bramley apple, and a couple of wonderfully gnarled trees stand outside, along with a lawn, an expansive vegetable patch and a very unusual compost heap. The contents are derived from human excrement.</p> <p>Apologies to anyone reading this over breakfast, but the subject can't be avoided. To understand the Autonomous House, we must go deep into its bowels. In a spacious cellar is housed the bulky, clinically-white presence of the Clivus Multrum composter. As the Vales explain in their book, \"the decision to put the bathrooms on the ground floor was partly related to the desire to minimise the drop from the toilet seat to the compost chamber\".</p> <p>The two are connected by shafts so large in diameter that very little waste touches the sides. There's something about the toilet that's vaguely reminiscent of an aircraft lavatory, except that it's slightly bigger and requires no flushing. An electric fan eliminates any lingering smell in the bathroom by drawing air from the room into the toilet, rather than the reverse. The end result of the composting process is odourless, too, as well as dry, and hence easy to transfer to the heap in the garden every six months or so.</p> <p>The entire flush-free sewerage system minimises water consumption. Water for washing and drinking is collected in large roof tanks. It trickles down through vertical pipes, well hidden from view, for the most part, until it reaches the cellar. There, it is stored in great vats, formerly used to transport orange juice, 20 of them and each holding 1,500 litres. Drinking water passes through a double- filtration system.</p> <p>Showers come out at what David calls \"a lovely pressure and nice temperature - the best we've had in England\". But the Croakers have become acutely conscious of the need to conserve. \"I count while I'm in there,\" says Helen, \"and turn it off after three minutes.\"</p> <p>The Autonomous House has never run out of water. Not even during the drought of 1995. All the same, the Croakers are constantly reassured by the sound of trickling and gurgling through the building. \"It's like the rattle on corrugated tin roofs in the bush,\" says Helen. \"On rainy nights, we stand out in the conservatory and it's music to our ears.\"</p> <p>The conservatory is large, south-facing and, along with the solar panels in the garden, plays a vital role in heating the whole house. \"When it gets over a certain temperature in here, we just open the roof windows and the heat rises to the living quarters,\" David explains. \"We can maintain the house at between 12C and 21C the year round.\"</p> <p>The Vales would appear to have achieved the right balance between insulation and ventilation.

Josey said her daughter had called her in the morning and said that Brazill was being suspended and that he was going to have to walk home. She said she didn't have a gun in her house. \"I thought he was the best boy. He was good,\" she said. Smith said that Brazill didn't cause any previous problems at school. \"This young man as far as we know was a good student, in school every day,\" he said. Lake Worth is just south of West Palm Beach. The school has about 1,500 students. It is a community school because adult-education classes are held there in the evenings. Lake Worth is in Palm Beach County, the fourth largest school district in Florida and 14th largest in the nation with more than 149,500 students.",

The youth, who cannot be named due to legal reasons, was found with nearly \u00a31,000 in cash and narcotics in his pocket, the court was told. After warning the child he faced a risk of custody, the judge remanded him into local authority care for a month, took off his wig, rubbed his hands across both eyes and added: \"Isn't it sad.\" The court heard how the schoolboy, now 13, had repeatedly tried to escape as plain-clothed police found 18 rocks of crack cocaine and two wraps of heroin worth \u00a3500 in his left tracksuit trouser pocket. Underneath them was \u00a3400 in cash. More crack cocaine, a small amount of cannabis and a further \u00a31,600 was found shortly afterwards at a friend's flat, which the youngster had moved into after a row with his mother. Detective Constable Ian Dickson, one of those who helped arrest and handcuff the boy, said after the trial: \"This has to be a terrible indictment on society.\" The youth showed no reaction as the foreman made it plain his defence of duress had been rejected by announcing majority 10-2 convictions on one count of possessing nearly 5 grams of crack cocaine and just over 700 milligrams of heroin, both with intent to supply. The boy had spent the two-day trial sitting in the well of the court between his mother and his solicitor. The court had heard how the youngster, acquitted at another court last week of two counts of robbery, was spotted cycling with a 15-year-old youth, by police last September in south London. Detective Constable Lesley Crofts recalled how she confronted the defendant while a colleague approached the older youth. \"As soon as I showed him my warrant card he slid off his bike and attempted to run away,\" she said. \"So I took hold of his arm, said I was going to search him and asked if he was carrying anything he shouldn't.\" In evidence the youth repeatedly told the court he had been \"frightened\" of the older, much bigger boy arrested with him and felt he had no choice but to obey him when told to look after the drugs and money.

      "body": "<p>Anyone who has ever been a keen angler knows that it is common to become an indiscriminate accumulator of equipment. As you learn more about the sport you just want more gear. You need different rods for fly-fishing, spinning and coarse fishing, and different reels. Then there are all the ephemera, floats and flies and boxes to put them in. Sea fishing is in a category of its own with multiplier reels, weights, feathers and lures.</p> <p>But anglers do not just buy new, state-of-the-art equipment. Many move towards collecting old and antique fishing tackle and memorabilia, anything from books and catalogues to reels, lures and floats. Some buy the equipment to use, others to admire or mess around with on a rainy day.</p> <p>Neil Freeman at Angling Auctions in Hammersmith, London, which he says is the world's leading specialist auctioneers, says: \"About 90% of the people who buy are fishermen or former fishermen.\"</p> <p>Chris Hewitt at Phillips auction house in London agrees. He holds two dedicated auctions a year that are well attended. \"There is a constantly growing interest. It is mostly anglers. There are a few investors,\" he says.</p> <p>And there are a lot of anglers, an estimated four million in the UK. The Dutch and the Germans are great fishing nations and the Japanese developed a craze for fishing in the good times of the 80s. The Americans are also enthusiastic, especially for big game fishing.</p> <p>Neil Freeman says: \"When I started in the 80s there was a handful of private clients; the rest were dealers. So prices were dealer-led. We have tried to build up a big client database around the world. The idea was to make fishing tackle like golf ephemera, where some fancy prices have been seen.\"</p> <p>In this, auctioneers and dealers like Freeman have been helped by the number of specialised books published. In England there have been The Best of British Baits by Chris Sanford and Hardy Brothers, The Masters, the Men and Their Reels by John Drewett. These have helped fishing tackle to become like golf items in that prices for really rare and well-made pieces have rocketed.</p> <p>Hardy Brothers' reels are top of the range. John Stephensen, who runs The Tackle Exchange in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, says: \"To collectors they are the best. They have precision engineering and are run on ball bearings. With ivory handles they can still be used today.\"</p> <p>Hardy Brothers was a small firm of gunsmiths and cutlery makers founded in Alnwick, Northumberland in 1872. In 1886 it turned to making sports goods equipment and has been making them ever since. Four years ago a small brass reel measuring 2.5 inches was sold at auction for \u00a317,000. It was a Hardy Perfect made in 1891, one of the first to be produced and extremely rare.</p> <p>This price was topped this week, however, when the White-Wickham Big Game Sea Fish Reels, which were estimated at \u00a315,000 to \u00a325,000, sold at the Phillips Fishing Tackle and Piscatoriana sale on Tuesday for \u00a348,000. These were made in 1929 to the specification of Huntington White Wickham, a well-known big game fisherman, who was an Ameri can, lived in England and fished in New Zealand. The reels are stamped No 1 and No 2 on to their respective drag wheels and, according to the Drewett book, only two are known to be in existence.</p> <p>Chris Hewitt reckons 10 years ago even these reels would have only fetched \u00a31,000. There has been a similar inflation in lures (baits). Chris Sandford's book has had a similar effect. Neil Freeman said he recently sold a very rare fish-shaped lure for \u00a35,000 which would have realised \u00a350 10 years ago.</p> <p>But these are rare items. Not all reels fetch these prices. John Stephensen recommends people look at Nottingham reels. These are cheap and easy to find and can be bought for around \u00a350 upwards. They were first made in the 1830s of wood, often with brass fittings, and are three to four inches in diameter. Other well-known makes of reels include Van Hofe, Abu, Illingworth, and Farlows on sale at Phillips from \u00a380 and, as we have seen, up to \u00a348,000.</p> <p>It is not just reels. At the Phillips sale there were some 400 items including some wonderful ephemera. Rods used to be made of split cane, before the lighter carbon fibre ones came into vogue.

      "bodyText": "Anyone who has ever been a keen angler knows that it is common to become an indiscriminate accumulator of equipment. As you learn more about the sport you just want more gear. You need different rods for fly-fishing, spinning and coarse fishing, and different reels. Then there are all the ephemera, floats and flies and boxes to put them in. Sea fishing is in a category of its own with multiplier reels, weights, feathers and lures. But anglers do not just buy new, state-of-the-art equipment. Many move towards collecting old and antique fishing tackle and memorabilia, anything from books and catalogues to reels, lures and floats. Some buy the equipment to use, others to admire or mess around with on a rainy day. Neil Freeman at Angling Auctions in Hammersmith, London, which he says is the world's leading specialist auctioneers, says: \"About 90% of the people who buy are fishermen or former fishermen.\" Chris Hewitt at Phillips auction house in London agrees. He holds two dedicated auctions a year that are well attended. \"There is a constantly growing interest. It is mostly anglers. There are a few investors,\" he says. And there are a lot of anglers, an estimated four million in the UK. The Dutch and the Germans are great fishing nations and the Japanese developed a craze for fishing in the good times of the 80s. The Americans are also enthusiastic, especially for big game fishing. Neil Freeman says: \"When I started in the 80s there was a handful of private clients; the rest were dealers. So prices were dealer-led. We have tried to build up a big client database around the world. The idea was to make fishing tackle like golf ephemera, where some fancy prices have been seen.\" In this, auctioneers and dealers like Freeman have been helped by the number of specialised books published. In England there have been The Best of British Baits by Chris Sanford and Hardy Brothers, The Masters, the Men and Their Reels by John Drewett. These have helped fishing tackle to become like golf items in that prices for really rare and well-made pieces have rocketed. Hardy Brothers' reels are top of the range. John Stephensen, who runs The Tackle Exchange in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, says: \"To collectors they are the best. They have precision engineering and are run on ball bearings. With ivory handles they can still be used today.\" Hardy Brothers was a small firm of gunsmiths and cutlery makers founded in Alnwick, Northumberland in 1872. In 1886 it turned to making sports goods equipment and has been making them ever since. Four years ago a small brass reel measuring 2.5 inches was sold at auction for \u00a317,000. It was a Hardy Perfect made in 1891, one of the first to be produced and extremely rare. This price was topped this week, however, when the White-Wickham Big Game Sea Fish Reels, which were estimated at \u00a315,000 to \u00a325,000, sold at the Phillips Fishing Tackle and Piscatoriana sale on Tuesday for \u00a348,000. These were made in 1929 to the specification of Huntington White Wickham, a well-known big game fisherman, who was an Ameri can, lived in England and fished in New Zealand. The reels are stamped No 1 and No 2 on to their respective drag wheels and, according to the Drewett book, only two are known to be in existence. Chris Hewitt reckons 10 years ago even these reels would have only fetched \u00a31,000. There has been a similar inflation in lures (baits). Chris Sandford's book has had a similar effect. Neil Freeman said he recently sold a very rare fish-shaped lure for \u00a35,000 which would have realised \u00a350 10 years ago. But these are rare items. Not all reels fetch these prices. John Stephensen recommends people look at Nottingham reels. These are cheap and easy to find and can be bought for around \u00a350 upwards. They were first made in the 1830s of wood, often with brass fittings, and are three to four inches in diameter. Other well-known makes of reels include Van Hofe, Abu, Illingworth, and Farlows on sale at Phillips from \u00a380 and, as we have seen, up to \u00a348,000. It is not just reels. At the Phillips sale there were some 400 items including some wonderful ephemera. Rods used to be made of split cane, before the lighter carbon fibre ones came into vogue. Rods do not fetch the same prices as reels as they are more difficult to display. A Chapman \"550\" 10ft built cane Avon Rod three-piece, also on sale at Phillips, was offered at \u00a380 to \u00a390. A Victorian wicker creel, late 19th century, was priced at \u00a360-\u00a380. Fish in glass cases were anything from \u00a380 to \u00a31,000. These prices are higher than they were five years ago, but still affordable. The Sandford and Drewett books were privately printed and are available at Phillips, Bayswater, but are expensive. \u0095 For further information, telephone Phillips, 020-7313-2700, Angling Auctions Hammersmith, London, 020-8749-4175, The Tackle Exchange, Dresden, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, 01782-599858.",

      "bodyText": "Whitehall auditors investigating a former government agency which spent hundreds of millions redeveloping parts of the north-east have uncovered potential evidence of criminal behaviour, it emerged yesterday. Police have launched an inquiry into one deal involving Teesside Development Corporation after allegations by local MPs over the past three years. But in a report for ministers, likely to be published shortly, auditors from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions will say they have been unable to prove or disprove other allegations against the agency, which was wound up two years ago. Sources say the allegation refers to a grant passed by the corporation to a company and allegedly subsequently diverted. Cleveland police said: \"We can confirm an investigation is under way into one case forwarded by government auditors and it would be improper for us to comment further as the investigation continues.\" This week the local government and regions minister, Hilary Armstrong, held talks with the former chairman of the corporation Sir Ron Norman and his deputy, Lord Dormand of Easington - the former Labour chief whip - before meeting MPs Ashok Kumar and Frank Cook. Two years ago in the Commons Mr Kumar said many people on Teesside were concerned about the agency leaving \"skeletons in the cupboard\". He claimed the corporation was built on the image of a visit from Margaret Thatcher - a well-publicised \"walk in the wilderness\" when she launched the agency on the site of an old steel works in 1987, hailing the \"initiative, talent and ability\" of Teesside. But Mr Kumar told MPs that behind the glossy image and hype, the corporation's achievements were limited to \"often inappropriate and threadbare development\". He said it could leave a legacy of potential liabilities. The former junior environment minister Alan Meale subsequently ordered his officials to investigate. Yesterday the department said that Ms Armstrong was taking legal advice before deciding to publish the full report, which was completed some time ago. But her department released one potentially damaging extract in which the auditors concluded: \"We find ourselves in the unsatisfactory position of not being able to prove or disprove all the allegations made.\" A spokesman added, however: \"Only in one case could the auditors find evidence to sustain a claim of criminal behaviour. The evidence obtained has been passed to police for further investigation, which we understand is continuing.\" But Sir Ron launched a bitter attack on Mr Kumar, claiming he had made 12 allegations against the corporation without having evidence. He also accused the department of using \"shameful, weasel\" words in claiming it could neither prove nor dis prove allegations. \"There is either evidence, or there isn't evidence,\" he added. \"If there isn't evidence the allegations are unproved and should be withdrawn. That's a basic ... principle of justice.\" After two years' haggling, one of the corporation's major legacies, a \u00a355m barrage across the Tees at Stockton, was recently passed by the department to the British Waterways Board - with a hefty one-off subsidy of \u00a317.8m to cover operating costs and future liabilities. The board, which runs Britain's 2,000-mile canal network, is due to take over full ownership shortly. The barrage, which effectively created an 11 mile freshwater \"lake\" on the Tees, has detractors. Bob Gibson, leader of Stockton council, said yesterday there was concern that river banks were being eroded by constant high-water levels on a once tidal river. He believed liablities could eventually include the cost of strenghening river banks to prevent parts of private gardens, and one large park, falling into the river. Ecologists say the barrage is destroying wildlife by preventing river sediment, vital to the food chain, passing down the Tees to a nature reserve on the estuary.",

      "body": "<p>The millennium commission used to boast of the dome as the jewel in its crown. These days it points out loudly that far more of its money - 75% of around \u00a32bn - has gone on dozens of large and thousands of small projects around the country, mostly finished on time, on budget, and a source of pride and pleasure to their communities.</p> <p>The millennium village halls, bridges, village greens and woodlands will mark the date for generations to come, when the memory of the dome has faded into a faint blush of embarrassment.</p> <p>Most of the funds, \u00a31.3 bn, have gone on 200 new and renovated buildings, from the towering mass of Tate Modern to a community hall in the Hebrides, on environmental projects and visitor attractions at more than 3,000 new sites.</p> <p>Among the 27 capital projects, each of which got a grant of over \u00a315m, a handful were the so-called \"landmark\" sites, including Tate Modern, the Lowry, and the National Botanic Gardens of Wales, which got grants of around \u00a350m.</p> <p>As the dome descends into further difficulties, just how well are the other millennium projects faring?</p> <p><b> Dynamic Earth</b></p> <p>There's an awkward symmetry between Scotland's showcase millennium attraction, opened last July, and the country's new parliament building.</p> <p>They should be neighbours; matching flagship projects for the historic quarter of Holyrood. But while the parliament remains an empty construction site, hampered by red tape and rising costs, Dynamic Earth is up, open and earning a reputation as one of the country's most popular tourist destinations. The centre tells the story of the planet in a series of audio-visual displays. Using wide-screen film projection, simulated earthquakes, virtual flyovers and hands-on exhibits, it takes visitors from the big bang through to an uncertain future. On the way they will come across a volcano erupting beneath their feet, a rainforest downpour, and the chill of the polar regions. Built on an industrial wasteland gifted to the city by a brewery firm, it is housed in a three-storey building designed by Sir Michael Hopkins with a translucent tented roof and a natural stone amphitheatre for a forecourt. Its chief executive, Julia Fawcett, who worked previously on the Granada Studios Tour, said Dynamic Earth was 30% ahead of its revenue targets and cautiously optimistic about the future.</p> <p><b> Cost:</b> \u00a334m; \u00a315m lottery money.</p> <p><b> Expected numbers: </b> 434,000 a year.</p> <p><b> Numbers so far:</b> (July 1999 to May 2000): 480,000.</p> <p><b> Verdict:</b> Tracey Preiss, 35, from York shire: \"I thought it was great. I was expecting more interactive exhibits, however. I would give it a seven out of 10.\" Stephanie Florence, nine, from Maryhill, Glasgow, visiting with her primary school class: \"I loved the time machine when you go down in the lift, with all the pictures; and the volcano when the floor was moving underneath your feet. It's really good.\"</p> <p><b> National Cycle Network</b></p> <p>The longest, most accessible and potentially best-used of all the millennial attractions is the National Cycle Network, which opens with a two-wheeled bonanza in Birmingham next month.</p> <p>The 5,000 mile route for cyclists and walkers threads across Britain, linking former railway lines and forest tracks with canal towpaths and stretches of minor road equipped with bike lanes or traffic calming measures.</p> <p>Made up of hundreds of self-contained parts, it is scheduled to double to 10,000 miles by the end of 2005.</p> <p>\"We haven't had this problem of a huge millennium attraction trying to encourage people to come to a single site,\" said Richard Tibbingham of Sustrans, the sustainable transport group behind the project. \"Everyone can be sure that a part of the National Cycle Network will be close to where they live.\"</p> <p>Organisation has also been modest and local. Cautious housekeeping has saved the network from serious financial flak, while the number of users of the first links to open has headed off criticism of empty cycle lanes or over-lavish track-laying on rural stretches. \"We think we're the most egalitarian of the big millennium projects,\" said Mr Tibbingham.\"</p> <p><b> Cost:</b> \u00a3200m. \u00a343.5m lottery money.</p> <p><b> Expected numbers: </b> 100m cycle trips and 40m walking trips a year.</p> <p><b> Numbers so far:</b> The 15 mile Bath-to-Bristol link - 1.5m cycle trips in its first year. Crude indicators suggest forecast will be exceeded.</p> <p><b> Verdict: </b> Success so far. Devon police officer Brian Askew: \"I bike to work - 10 miles between Torrington and Bideford - on a route that's safe day and night. It's a nice sedate ride and it clears your head coming back from work.\"</p> <p><b> National Botanic Garden of Wales</b></p> <p>Boasting the world's largest single span glasshouse and one of the longest herbaceous borders in Europe, the National Botanic Garden of Wales opened this week, aiming to be the model for the environmentally sustainable garden of the future.</p> <p>The first national botanic garden to be created for 200 years, situated in the Towy valley near Llanarthne, Carmarthenshire, it is expected to become one of Wales's leading visitor attractions but is also ded icated to scientific research, conservation and education. Conservation projects will include work to preserve Britain's rarest tree, Sorbus Leyana. The gardens have been established in 568 acres of historic parkland at Middleton Hall, the country estate designed for the financier William Paxton. They mix carefully restored regency buildings with Norman Foster's glasshouse, a tilted glass dome housing myriad plants. Other features include a water discovery centre set on stilts over one of the seven lakes that form a \"necklace\" around the grounds and an exhibition dedicated to the Physicians of Myddfai, the Welsh herbal healers of the middle ages.</p> <p><b> Cost: </b> \u00a343.3m; lottery money: \u00a321.7 m.</p> <p><b> Expected number of visitors.</b> This year 170,000, rising to 250,000 a year after four years.</p> <p><b> Visitors so far:</b> 1,200 on day one.</p> <p><b> Verdict:</b> The plants will take time to mature and establish themselves but much praise from opening day visitors.</p> <p><b> The Lowry</b></p> <p>The Lowry in Salford opened in a blaze of fireworks and some chaos caused by building delays on April 28, a date its managers had bravely announced two years in advance. An estimated 70,000 visitors - way above expectations - turned up in the first week to see its galleries, two auditoriums and bars.

      "bodyText": "The millennium commission used to boast of the dome as the jewel in its crown. These days it points out loudly that far more of its money - 75% of around \u00a32bn - has gone on dozens of large and thousands of small projects around the country, mostly finished on time, on budget, and a source of pride and pleasure to their communities. The millennium village halls, bridges, village greens and woodlands will mark the date for generations to come, when the memory of the dome has faded into a faint blush of embarrassment. Most of the funds, \u00a31.3 bn, have gone on 200 new and renovated buildings, from the towering mass of Tate Modern to a community hall in the Hebrides, on environmental projects and visitor attractions at more than 3,000 new sites. Among the 27 capital projects, each of which got a grant of over \u00a315m, a handful were the so-called \"landmark\" sites, including Tate Modern, the Lowry, and the National Botanic Gardens of Wales, which got grants of around \u00a350m. As the dome descends into further difficulties, just how well are the other millennium projects faring? Dynamic Earth There's an awkward symmetry between Scotland's showcase millennium attraction, opened last July, and the country's new parliament building. They should be neighbours; matching flagship projects for the historic quarter of Holyrood. But while the parliament remains an empty construction site, hampered by red tape and rising costs, Dynamic Earth is up, open and earning a reputation as one of the country's most popular tourist destinations. The centre tells the story of the planet in a series of audio-visual displays. Using wide-screen film projection, simulated earthquakes, virtual flyovers and hands-on exhibits, it takes visitors from the big bang through to an uncertain future. On the way they will come across a volcano erupting beneath their feet, a rainforest downpour, and the chill of the polar regions. Built on an industrial wasteland gifted to the city by a brewery firm, it is housed in a three-storey building designed by Sir Michael Hopkins with a translucent tented roof and a natural stone amphitheatre for a forecourt. Its chief executive, Julia Fawcett, who worked previously on the Granada Studios Tour, said Dynamic Earth was 30% ahead of its revenue targets and cautiously optimistic about the future. Cost: \u00a334m; \u00a315m lottery money. Expected numbers: 434,000 a year. Numbers so far: (July 1999 to May 2000): 480,000. Verdict: Tracey Preiss, 35, from York shire: \"I thought it was great. I was expecting more interactive exhibits, however. I would give it a seven out of 10.\" Stephanie Florence, nine, from Maryhill, Glasgow, visiting with her primary school class: \"I loved the time machine when you go down in the lift, with all the pictures; and the volcano when the floor was moving underneath your feet. It's really good.\" National Cycle Network The longest, most accessible and potentially best-used of all the millennial attractions is the National Cycle Network, which opens with a two-wheeled bonanza in Birmingham next month. The 5,000 mile route for cyclists and walkers threads across Britain, linking former railway lines and forest tracks with canal towpaths and stretches of minor road equipped with bike lanes or traffic calming measures. Made up of hundreds of self-contained parts, it is scheduled to double to 10,000 miles by the end of 2005. \"We haven't had this problem of a huge millennium attraction trying to encourage people to come to a single site,\" said Richard Tibbingham of Sustrans, the sustainable transport group behind the project. \"Everyone can be sure that a part of the National Cycle Network will be close to where they live.\" Organisation has also been modest and local. Cautious housekeeping has saved the network from serious financial flak, while the number of users of the first links to open has headed off criticism of empty cycle lanes or over-lavish track-laying on rural stretches. \"We think we're the most egalitarian of the big millennium projects,\" said Mr Tibbingham.\" Cost: \u00a3200m. \u00a343.5m lottery money. Expected numbers: 100m cycle trips and 40m walking trips a year. Numbers so far: The 15 mile Bath-to-Bristol link - 1.5m cycle trips in its first year. Crude indicators suggest forecast will be exceeded. Verdict: Success so far. Devon police officer Brian Askew: \"I bike to work - 10 miles between Torrington and Bideford - on a route that's safe day and night. It's a nice sedate ride and it clears your head coming back from work.\" National Botanic Garden of Wales Boasting the world's largest single span glasshouse and one of the longest herbaceous borders in Europe, the National Botanic Garden of Wales opened this week, aiming to be the model for the environmentally sustainable garden of the future. The first national botanic garden to be created for 200 years, situated in the Towy valley near Llanarthne, Carmarthenshire, it is expected to become one of Wales's leading visitor attractions but is also ded icated to scientific research, conservation and education. Conservation projects will include work to preserve Britain's rarest tree, Sorbus Leyana. The gardens have been established in 568 acres of historic parkland at Middleton Hall, the country estate designed for the financier William Paxton. They mix carefully restored regency buildings with Norman Foster's glasshouse, a tilted glass dome housing myriad plants. Other features include a water discovery centre set on stilts over one of the seven lakes that form a \"necklace\" around the grounds and an exhibition dedicated to the Physicians of Myddfai, the Welsh herbal healers of the middle ages. Cost: \u00a343.3m; lottery money: \u00a321.7 m. Expected number of visitors. This year 170,000, rising to 250,000 a year after four years. Visitors so far: 1,200 on day one. Verdict: The plants will take time to mature and establish themselves but much praise from opening day visitors. The Lowry The Lowry in Salford opened in a blaze of fireworks and some chaos caused by building delays on April 28, a date its managers had bravely announced two years in advance. An estimated 70,000 visitors - way above expectations - turned up in the first week to see its galleries, two auditoriums and bars. Some were awestruck, not least by the brash purple and yellow of the foyer's walls and the lurid orange carpet. Other visitors complained that they could not find the lavatories (no signs) or their seats in the smaller theatre (no numbers). \"We planned to have a commissioning period of a couple of months before opening,\" said Stephen Hetherington, the Lowry's director. \"In the end we had a couple of hours. But it's a fantastic place and the building has been so well received.\" The Lowry has become a major visitor attraction and some tinkering with arrangements designed to serve the galleries and theatres has been done to cope with rush. Paris Opera Ballet's production of La Bayadere, the Royal National Theatre's Oresteia and Fascinating Aida sold out and Opera North is selling well but other shows have played to sometimes sparse houses. Cost: \u00a3106m. Lottery money: \u00a368.9m. Projected visitor numbers: 770,000 a year. Numbers so far : 70,000 in first week. Verdict : A huge asset for the north - or it will be when it's finished. Special report on the Guardian network at www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/2000",

President Fujimori, who is running for an unprecedented third term, has been characteristically uncompromising in refusing to delay the vote, despite recommendations from the Organisation of American States (OAS), the US, and several European and Latin American governments. The election process - already largely discredited by allegations of fraud - was plunged into its deepest crisis last week when Mr Fujimori's challenger, Alejandro Toledo, pulled out of the race, saying it was pointless running in unfair elections. A wave of social unrest has spread across the country since Mr Toledo - a former World Bank economist who appeared from nowhere to push Mr Fujimori into a second round last month - withdrew his candidacy. On Thursday night tear gas was used to disperse protesters who had set fire to a balcony of the presidential palace in Lima. Truck drivers and teachers staged a strike in the Andean city of Cuzco, and university students in Lima and Arequipa repeatedly attacked riot police officers with stones. \"Alberto Fujimori's government will be illegitimate, a source of permanent instability, and I don't think it can last more than six to 12 months,\" said Mr Toledo.

But despite his fresh image and rhetoric, his economic policies are similar to Mr Fujimori's and he seems to offer only a change of style. Mr Toledo, who was a shoe-shine boy as a child and then went to Harvard, has no political background and his naivety perhaps explains impetuous and contradictory statements that have infuriated Peruvians and diplomats negotiating to postpone the election. As well as doubts about vote-rigging, human rights groups are taking seriously allegations by a freelance journalist for an opposition newspaper that he was tortured by intelligence service officers looking for videos and computer disks.

      "body": "<p>The Indian government last night appeared to be on the brink of ending its 50-year love affair with the Hindustan Ambassador car, the subcontinent's most venerable, unreliable and stately mode of transport for officials.</p> <p>The ministry for heavy industry, which is responsible for car production, said it was considering recommending that the government dumps its 3,000-strong Ambassador fleet in favour of more modern-looking Marutis. Both cars are made in India, but the Maruti company - a partnership with the Japanese Suzuki corporation - is 50% state-owned.</p> <p>Although no final decision has been made, ministers are sympathetic to the argument that it makes economic sense to buy official vehicles from a government concern. They are also painfully aware of the increasingly incongruous figure the Ambassador cuts, in a capital city now full of imported BMWs and Mercedes.</p> <p>\"People have lost their taste for it. The Ambassador is diesel driven and makes a lot of noise. In the winter it takes time to start up. If the battery is slightly low, you have to push it to get it going. You often need help,\" a senior official said.</p> <p>The Ambassador, which is based on the Morris Oxford, has been rolling off the production line since 1957. It has been used as an official car by every Indian prime minister since independence. For much of the post-war period it enjoyed a virtual monopoly on India's potholed and cow-infested roads. It remains the official vehicle of senior politicians, top civil servants, bank managers, generals, and taxi drivers.</p> <p>But with the arrival in 1983 of the Maruti, which proved an instant hit with the burgeoning middle-class, it fell on hard times. The Amby, as it is affectionately known, now only commands 5% of India's car market, compared to Maruti's 80% share.</p> <p>\"It was never a particularly reliable car. But at least it was cheap. Now newer, better cars are only a little more expensive,\" a motor analyst, Murad Ali Baig, said.</p> <p>Deepak Jain, the general manager of Hindustan Motors, which has manufactured Ambassadors in its Calcutta factory since 1942, last night denied it was the end of the road for the car.</p> <p>\"Our relationship with government goes back a long way. They like our cars because of their safety and comfort. People will continue to drive them.\" The Ambassador had undergone several modernisations, he added.</p> <p>The Ambassador is likely to be replaced by the Maruti Baleno, a top-of-the-range saloon which was launched six months ago.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Indian government last night appeared to be on the brink of ending its 50-year love affair with the Hindustan Ambassador car, the subcontinent's most venerable, unreliable and stately mode of transport for officials. The ministry for heavy industry, which is responsible for car production, said it was considering recommending that the government dumps its 3,000-strong Ambassador fleet in favour of more modern-looking Marutis. Both cars are made in India, but the Maruti company - a partnership with the Japanese Suzuki corporation - is 50% state-owned. Although no final decision has been made, ministers are sympathetic to the argument that it makes economic sense to buy official vehicles from a government concern. They are also painfully aware of the increasingly incongruous figure the Ambassador cuts, in a capital city now full of imported BMWs and Mercedes. \"People have lost their taste for it. The Ambassador is diesel driven and makes a lot of noise. In the winter it takes time to start up. If the battery is slightly low, you have to push it to get it going. You often need help,\" a senior official said. The Ambassador, which is based on the Morris Oxford, has been rolling off the production line since 1957. It has been used as an official car by every Indian prime minister since independence. For much of the post-war period it enjoyed a virtual monopoly on India's potholed and cow-infested roads. It remains the official vehicle of senior politicians, top civil servants, bank managers, generals, and taxi drivers. But with the arrival in 1983 of the Maruti, which proved an instant hit with the burgeoning middle-class, it fell on hard times. The Amby, as it is affectionately known, now only commands 5% of India's car market, compared to Maruti's 80% share. \"It was never a particularly reliable car. But at least it was cheap. Now newer, better cars are only a little more expensive,\" a motor analyst, Murad Ali Baig, said. Deepak Jain, the general manager of Hindustan Motors, which has manufactured Ambassadors in its Calcutta factory since 1942, last night denied it was the end of the road for the car. \"Our relationship with government goes back a long way. They like our cars because of their safety and comfort. People will continue to drive them.\" The Ambassador had undergone several modernisations, he added. The Ambassador is likely to be replaced by the Maruti Baleno, a top-of-the-range saloon which was launched six months ago.",

But yesterday a death row prisoner in Texas was told that his attempt to sell tickets for his execution via the internet had been banned by the authorities.</p> <p>Michael Toney, aged 34, is on death row in Forth Worth for a triple murder committed in 1985. Anxious to have some money to fund a last-minute appeal - and, if that failed, to leave something for his family - he asked a friend to advertise five tickets for his execution on the online auction service, eBay.</p> <p>\"I am on Texas death row for a crime I did not commit,\" read the advertisement, which offered five front row seats for $100 each. \"I do not know what kind of people would donate money to watch an innocent man be murdered. However, I do know that there are people out there who will.\"</p> <p>Prisoners are not allowed to make use of the internet in this way, but Toney managed to persuade a woman who had been a prosecution witness against him but had since become a friend to place the ad. However, retribution was swifter than is normal in the Texan justice system.</p> <p>A spokesman for eBay, Kevin Pursglove, said yesterday that the item had been withdrawn as soon as the company became aware of its import. \"Clearly we don't want an item like this on eBay,\" he said. \"The bottom line is, he doesn't have a right to do this.\"</p> <p>Mr Pursglove said that Toney had violated the eBay agreement by including a long plea about his innocence when the rules stated that only descriptions of the items on sale were allowed.</p> <p>A spokesman for the criminal justice department in Texas said of the plan: \"Clever idea, but it never had a chance to get off the ground.\"</p> <p>While Toney is entitled to have five guests attend his farewell, there has to be a legitimate connection and those attending have to be family, friends or a spiritual adviser.</p> <p>\"There has to be a relation ship and we do not consider that the buyer-seller relationship qualifies.\" Another criminal justice department spokesman said that Toney, as a convict, had no right to sell anything: \"He could not sell popsicles on the street. This man has no rights in the free world. Period. End of story.\"</p> <p>Even Toney's lawyer was unimpressed by his client's move. Robert Ford told the internet crime news service APBnews: \"This makes him look like an idiot.</p> <p>\"I just hate to have clients do things like this. The courts here are very political and, contrary to what people would be led to believe, judges do read newspapers. I think they're influenced by many factors, and this is negative.\"</p> <p>Toney was convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Angela Blount, her father Joe and her cousin, Michael Columbus, aged 18. The three were killed in 1985 after a bomb in a briefcase - intended for a different victim in a drugs feud - was left outside their mobile home by mistake.</p> <p>Toney was arrested after allegedly boasting about the case to a fellow-inmate in jail where he was serving a sentence for a different crime.</p> <p>Texas, the state of which the Republican presidential candidate George W Bush is governor, executes more people than any other US state.</p> <p>Years ago Bob Dylan wrote in his song Desolation Row that \"they're selling postcards of the hanging\". Toney might concede that that still has more of a ring to it than \"they're selling tickets to the lethal injection\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "They were front row seats to die for and they were going for a bargain $100 each. But yesterday a death row prisoner in Texas was told that his attempt to sell tickets for his execution via the internet had been banned by the authorities. Michael Toney, aged 34, is on death row in Forth Worth for a triple murder committed in 1985. Anxious to have some money to fund a last-minute appeal - and, if that failed, to leave something for his family - he asked a friend to advertise five tickets for his execution on the online auction service, eBay. \"I am on Texas death row for a crime I did not commit,\" read the advertisement, which offered five front row seats for $100 each. \"I do not know what kind of people would donate money to watch an innocent man be murdered. However, I do know that there are people out there who will.\" Prisoners are not allowed to make use of the internet in this way, but Toney managed to persuade a woman who had been a prosecution witness against him but had since become a friend to place the ad. However, retribution was swifter than is normal in the Texan justice system. A spokesman for eBay, Kevin Pursglove, said yesterday that the item had been withdrawn as soon as the company became aware of its import. \"Clearly we don't want an item like this on eBay,\" he said. \"The bottom line is, he doesn't have a right to do this.\" Mr Pursglove said that Toney had violated the eBay agreement by including a long plea about his innocence when the rules stated that only descriptions of the items on sale were allowed. A spokesman for the criminal justice department in Texas said of the plan: \"Clever idea, but it never had a chance to get off the ground.\" While Toney is entitled to have five guests attend his farewell, there has to be a legitimate connection and those attending have to be family, friends or a spiritual adviser. \"There has to be a relation ship and we do not consider that the buyer-seller relationship qualifies.\" Another criminal justice department spokesman said that Toney, as a convict, had no right to sell anything: \"He could not sell popsicles on the street. This man has no rights in the free world. Period. End of story.\" Even Toney's lawyer was unimpressed by his client's move. Robert Ford told the internet crime news service APBnews: \"This makes him look like an idiot. \"I just hate to have clients do things like this. The courts here are very political and, contrary to what people would be led to believe, judges do read newspapers. I think they're influenced by many factors, and this is negative.\" Toney was convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Angela Blount, her father Joe and her cousin, Michael Columbus, aged 18. The three were killed in 1985 after a bomb in a briefcase - intended for a different victim in a drugs feud - was left outside their mobile home by mistake. Toney was arrested after allegedly boasting about the case to a fellow-inmate in jail where he was serving a sentence for a different crime. Texas, the state of which the Republican presidential candidate George W Bush is governor, executes more people than any other US state. Years ago Bob Dylan wrote in his song Desolation Row that \"they're selling postcards of the hanging\". Toney might concede that that still has more of a ring to it than \"they're selling tickets to the lethal injection\".",

Hanging tough, Sir Andrew has insisted on taking all his furniture with him - including some very swish orange sofas - but the room is not really big enough for all his clobber. \"It looks like a junk shop in there,\" says one Treasury mole. A junk shop! Now, there's a bit of private-sector initiative. </p> <p>\u0095 All this moving about in Great George Street is taking its toll on those first-class minds, it seems. Treasury communiqu\u00e9 69/00, issued on Thursday, declared: \"Chancellor confirms unchanged monetary policy committee remit,\" giving an annual inflation target of 2.5%. Or rather, giving a target of 2.5% on page one. By page two, Mr Brown was declaring: \"The inflation target is 2.25% at all times: that is the rate which the MPC is required to achieve.\" (Definitions of \"at all times\" on a postcard, please). With the inflation target diving faster than the euro, the Treasury was clarifying like billy-oh. The target is, in fact, 2.5%, and inside the Treasury a hapless official is writing this fact out, 100 times. </p> <p>\u0095 Elsewhere in the wonderful world of government numbers, the new head of the Office for National Statistics flew into London on Tuesday to take up his new post. Hardly had Len Cook - formerly head of the ONS's New Zealand equivalent - time to stretch his legs than an ONS official - unaware that this was the new boss-man - selected him to take part in an international passenger survey. </p> <p>\u0095 Over in the e-economy - where no responsible person (hee, hee) should take any pleasure from the sight of web business heading south (ha, ha, ha) - the 170-page lurid green prospectus for Egg, the about to be floated banking arm of the Prudential, contains a number of gems, including this prize piece of e-babble about developing the Egg name: \"We seek to build our brand by delivering an experience that encourages customers to consider Egg as 'my ground-breaking e-partner who helps me grow by making the most of my money and my life'.\" Oh that's so, like, deep. Prudential must just hope that, on the day, the shares aren't. </p> <p>\u0095 Meanwhile, the e-est of e-commerce outfits, the First Tuesday networking club famed for bringing bright sparks and money-bags together in the same room, is starting its own venture capital fund. Bad news for fans of co-founder Julie Meyer's personal web page which, over the years, has beamed the thoughts and doings of the network queen across the world. Who can forget her restaurant reviews from her time at the Insead management school in France? Alas, the weighty responsibilities of risk capitalism seem to have persuaded Miss Meyer to cease transmission. </p> <p>\u0095 Finally, R3, the modish new handle for the insolvency practitioners' professional body, is hosting a big-big seminar on June 12 to get some kind of focus on the blizzard of government initiatives to get bankrupt persons and companies off the hook more easily/to develop a real culture of risk and enterprise (take your pick). Where to hold it? The Dome, itself allegedly threatening to slide into insolvency, would have been the obvious choice, but in the end R3 settled for the new dumbed-down Barbican Centre, where the ceaseless amusement arcade racket from its wretched Star Wars exhibition ought to give a reasonable facsimile of being in the Pride of Greenwich. How they will hear themselves think is another problem.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 As the painters and decorators of the Private Finance Initiative move into the Treasury under the innovative tarting-up partnership between Her Majesty's government and free enterprise, the department's toppest of top brass are finding themselves shoved aside to make way for the step ladders and bottles of turpentine. First to get the big-E was the chancellor, Gordon Brown, hitherto housed in an office roughly the size of Mussolini's private apartments. Mr Brown, his files, pencils, rulers and pad of graph paper have been pushed down the corridor to two rather smaller chambers, one for him to work in (formerly occupied by a humble typist) and a larger room for meeting guests. The chancellor may be exiled for up to two years, we hear. Meanwhile, another refugee is Sir Andrew Turnbull, the permanent secretary, who has been shifted out of probably the Treasury's most beautiful rooms into a smaller office. Hanging tough, Sir Andrew has insisted on taking all his furniture with him - including some very swish orange sofas - but the room is not really big enough for all his clobber. \"It looks like a junk shop in there,\" says one Treasury mole. A junk shop! Now, there's a bit of private-sector initiative. \u0095 All this moving about in Great George Street is taking its toll on those first-class minds, it seems. Treasury communiqu\u00e9 69/00, issued on Thursday, declared: \"Chancellor confirms unchanged monetary policy committee remit,\" giving an annual inflation target of 2.5%. Or rather, giving a target of 2.5% on page one. By page two, Mr Brown was declaring: \"The inflation target is 2.25% at all times: that is the rate which the MPC is required to achieve.\" (Definitions of \"at all times\" on a postcard, please). With the inflation target diving faster than the euro, the Treasury was clarifying like billy-oh. The target is, in fact, 2.5%, and inside the Treasury a hapless official is writing this fact out, 100 times. \u0095 Elsewhere in the wonderful world of government numbers, the new head of the Office for National Statistics flew into London on Tuesday to take up his new post. Hardly had Len Cook - formerly head of the ONS's New Zealand equivalent - time to stretch his legs than an ONS official - unaware that this was the new boss-man - selected him to take part in an international passenger survey. \u0095 Over in the e-economy - where no responsible person (hee, hee) should take any pleasure from the sight of web business heading south (ha, ha, ha) - the 170-page lurid green prospectus for Egg, the about to be floated banking arm of the Prudential, contains a number of gems, including this prize piece of e-babble about developing the Egg name: \"We seek to build our brand by delivering an experience that encourages customers to consider Egg as 'my ground-breaking e-partner who helps me grow by making the most of my money and my life'.\" Oh that's so, like, deep. Prudential must just hope that, on the day, the shares aren't. \u0095 Meanwhile, the e-est of e-commerce outfits, the First Tuesday networking club famed for bringing bright sparks and money-bags together in the same room, is starting its own venture capital fund. Bad news for fans of co-founder Julie Meyer's personal web page which, over the years, has beamed the thoughts and doings of the network queen across the world. Who can forget her restaurant reviews from her time at the Insead management school in France? Alas, the weighty responsibilities of risk capitalism seem to have persuaded Miss Meyer to cease transmission. \u0095 Finally, R3, the modish new handle for the insolvency practitioners' professional body, is hosting a big-big seminar on June 12 to get some kind of focus on the blizzard of government initiatives to get bankrupt persons and companies off the hook more easily/to develop a real culture of risk and enterprise (take your pick). Where to hold it? The Dome, itself allegedly threatening to slide into insolvency, would have been the obvious choice, but in the end R3 settled for the new dumbed-down Barbican Centre, where the ceaseless amusement arcade racket from its wretched Star Wars exhibition ought to give a reasonable facsimile of being in the Pride of Greenwich. How they will hear themselves think is another problem.",

      "byline": "Jeremy Hardy",

      "body": "<p>There was an interesting discussion on Channel 4 News this week between a campaigner for privacy and Tom King, who was in the cabinet in those distant happy days when we looked forward to getting rid of the Tories.</p> <p>The discussion was about the government's plans to snoop on our email correspondence - something I'll be stunned if they're not doing already. King said that the interception of private electronic correspondence is essential to the fight against terrorism. That is one of those neat little phrases intended to bring discussions to a close, akin to \"Because I said so\" and \"I'm afraid that's all we've got time for\".</p> <p>Our rulers invite us to believe that our safety is their over-riding consideration and that they therefore fight a lonely fight, day in, day out, against crime, drugs and a host of other menaces, such as people from other countries wanting to live here. They tell us that they can and will beat these things but that it will need eternal vigilance on their part and complete subordination on ours. For these threats to be overcome, the state must know everything about us and we must know nothing about the state. And if we're not happy with the relationship, it can only be supposed either that we have no regard for the safety of our children, or that we are up to no good ourselves.</p> <p>Clearly, the state is highly selective. If the government launches a big drive against some new danger, we can be almost certain that we are statistically more likely to die from choking on a stamp or drowning in the shower. Moreover, for something to scare us, and for us to be reassured that the government is tackling it, the less we know about it the better.</p> <p>One of the things that the internet has done is to widely disseminate enormous amounts of factual information. It also disseminates racism and pornography, but so do newsagents. The muck that appears in mainstream newspapers defaming refugees and promoting intolerance is far more insidious in its effect than the neo-Nazi dementia appearing on the web. And one can use the web to find out about the way neo-Nazis hound eastern European Gypsies with impunity, something you won't hear about from the lips of ministers or in the editorials of many newspapers.</p> <p>I'm sure the government will make great play of intercepting racists' emails but, given the way it has assisted the resurgence of racism around the asylum issue, we should not be impressed. And I doubt whether the government feels threatened by fascists in the way it feels threatened by anti-capitalists. In fact, the new laws to deal with \"terrorism\" define it pretty much as anything that interrupts the smooth operation of the market.</p> <p>As the threat of paramilitary violence recedes, the government has thrown the dictionary out the window. \"Terrorism\" now incorporates what we used to call criminal damage and dissidence.</p> <p>It is events like Seattle that put the wind up governments - not the fear that an as yet unknown Islamic fundamentalist group is planning to kill us all with a matchbox full of poisoned couscous, so deadly it can wipe out Middle England and so portable it can be delivered by a suicide driver to a boot-sale in Leamington Spa.</p> <p>Jack Straw did not invent state paranoia. It has always been the case that even the most respectable and well-behaved activists are put under surveillance. But the more seriously the sovereignty of Whitehall is challenged, the more vengeful the state becomes.

      "bodyText": "There was an interesting discussion on Channel 4 News this week between a campaigner for privacy and Tom King, who was in the cabinet in those distant happy days when we looked forward to getting rid of the Tories. The discussion was about the government's plans to snoop on our email correspondence - something I'll be stunned if they're not doing already. King said that the interception of private electronic correspondence is essential to the fight against terrorism. That is one of those neat little phrases intended to bring discussions to a close, akin to \"Because I said so\" and \"I'm afraid that's all we've got time for\". Our rulers invite us to believe that our safety is their over-riding consideration and that they therefore fight a lonely fight, day in, day out, against crime, drugs and a host of other menaces, such as people from other countries wanting to live here. They tell us that they can and will beat these things but that it will need eternal vigilance on their part and complete subordination on ours. For these threats to be overcome, the state must know everything about us and we must know nothing about the state. And if we're not happy with the relationship, it can only be supposed either that we have no regard for the safety of our children, or that we are up to no good ourselves. Clearly, the state is highly selective. If the government launches a big drive against some new danger, we can be almost certain that we are statistically more likely to die from choking on a stamp or drowning in the shower. Moreover, for something to scare us, and for us to be reassured that the government is tackling it, the less we know about it the better. One of the things that the internet has done is to widely disseminate enormous amounts of factual information. It also disseminates racism and pornography, but so do newsagents. The muck that appears in mainstream newspapers defaming refugees and promoting intolerance is far more insidious in its effect than the neo-Nazi dementia appearing on the web. And one can use the web to find out about the way neo-Nazis hound eastern European Gypsies with impunity, something you won't hear about from the lips of ministers or in the editorials of many newspapers. I'm sure the government will make great play of intercepting racists' emails but, given the way it has assisted the resurgence of racism around the asylum issue, we should not be impressed. And I doubt whether the government feels threatened by fascists in the way it feels threatened by anti-capitalists. In fact, the new laws to deal with \"terrorism\" define it pretty much as anything that interrupts the smooth operation of the market. As the threat of paramilitary violence recedes, the government has thrown the dictionary out the window. \"Terrorism\" now incorporates what we used to call criminal damage and dissidence. It is events like Seattle that put the wind up governments - not the fear that an as yet unknown Islamic fundamentalist group is planning to kill us all with a matchbox full of poisoned couscous, so deadly it can wipe out Middle England and so portable it can be delivered by a suicide driver to a boot-sale in Leamington Spa. Jack Straw did not invent state paranoia. It has always been the case that even the most respectable and well-behaved activists are put under surveillance. But the more seriously the sovereignty of Whitehall is challenged, the more vengeful the state becomes. The police are still looking for people who were in Trafalgar Square when the poll tax was brought down. I'm sure they have computer generated pictures of what the people look like 12 years older and sitting at a computer. And Cherie Booth QC did very well helping councils pursue those who refused to pay the poll tax, in the days before she was known as the mother of our first hereditary prime minister. Today, the government seems more worried than ever by direct action, perhaps because it has done so much to convince people that direct action is now the only way forward. The government will not even reform capitalism: only the power of the informed consumer and protestor will do that. The fact that the government dislikes the exchange of information was made clear by Clare Dyer in this paper on Monday. The local government and freedom of information bills ensure that people are only entitled to privacy when taking decisions that affect the public. And the terrorism bill means that the job of journalists is not to inform us but to inform on us. So obviously information by email is something the government would be keen to discourage. And information openly displayed on the web can be removed by those with power. The Police Federation had a whole site dedicated to miscarriages of justice taken down in February.

      "bodyText": "The government is planning to establish a number of powerful people's watchdogs which will be able to block commercial use of controversial new technologies, according to official papers obtained by The Guardian. Documents prepared for endorsement by Labour's national policy forum this summer include the establishment of 'citizens' commissions' as an extension of plans to introduce a consumer voice into the regulation of GM technologies and human gene research. Ministers have admitted that purely scientific advisory committees have lost the confidence of the public, and they are determined to take on board consumer views. The environment commission paper which contains the watchdog plan is one of six prepared under the direction of cabinet ministers, such as Stephen Byers and Gordon Brown, and gives a broad insight into the direction of a second term Labour government. Other second term ideas raised in the six documents include measures to bring more working class people into university education, a single safety body for transport, voting on the internet, expansion of the role of the UN, an end to the dogmatic belief in mixed ability teaching in secondary education and regulation of the converging communication technologies. The confidential papers also reject union calls for renationalisation of the railways. To the relief of supporters of electoral reform, the papers retain the commitment to hold a referendum, saying: \"The final decision on changing the electoral system for the House of Commons will rest with the British people in a referendum.\" But it is also pointed out that the party conference in 1993 committed the party to support first past the post. A separate consultation paper hints the party will give all party members, including ministers, freedom to express their personal views on PR during a referendum campaign. The papers again insist Labour will make a judgment on a single currency early in the parliament, but stress the benefits, including elimination of exchange rate risks on almost 50% of trade which British industry does. But Labour's plans for a new citizens' commission will raise most interest. The paper states: \"To address public concerns, Labour could set up a citizens' commission, or other publicly trusted machinery, such as our two new commissions on biotechnology, to give consumers a voice within government and consider and publicly debate risks, and if necessary suspend the activities while further knowledge is gained.\" Admitting the public is concerned about the risks produced from new technologies and science, and citing the example of GM foods and mobile phones, the environment paper concludes there are likely to be other examples in the future. The government has already started to move to give greater credibility to its scientific regulatory bodies with the new human genetics commission, which reports to health and science ministers, and a new agriculture and environment biotechnology commission. The bodies are made up of lay members as well as ethicists, consumers and industrialists, but they have no regulatory power and are meant to give advice to ministers on \"the big picture\". The government has to approve plans for their work and will also have the power \"where appropriate\" to direct them not to take on work. The new \"citizen's commissions\" would have scientists as well as consumer champions on board and would crucially have the power to affect the dispersal of new technology and processes throughout the country. The need for such a body follows the controversies over the safety of mobile phones and GM crops. Only this week it was revealed that hundreds of farmers had unwittingly planted thousands of acres with GM seeds. The government is well aware of the worries among consumers, and the environment policy paper is cautious about the effect of GM technology, acknowledging it must address public suspicion. \"If in the course of our tests we discover that any GM crops damage health or the environment more than conventional crops we will not allow commercial planting to succeed\" Meanwhile demands grew yesterday for the resignation of Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, over his handling of the genetically modified crops crisis. The calls came from opposition MPs at Westminster and in the devolved Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly. Tim Yeo, the shadow agriculture minister, accused Mr Brown of a \"lack of communication\" following the accidental planting of GM contaminated oilseed rape at 600 farms. Environment campaigners urged the government to follow the lead of France and Sweden and order the destruction of affected crops. The Conservatives claimed Mr Brown failed to inform his Scottish and Welsh counterparts about the problem of GM contaminated oilseed rape crops for more than three weeks after the agriculture ministry in London was advised that such crops were growing.",

Thermal imaging equipment and recorders will be installed in the Tudor \"haunted gallery\" at Hampton Court for 10 days in the first authorised attempt to link murmurs, patches of cold air and soft footsteps to the spirit of a beheaded wife of Henry VIII. Temperature gauges and cameras will survey other areas of the palace, where the unhappy Catherine Howard - Henry's fifth wife and the second to be executed - has long been held responsible for odd happenings. A spokeswoman at the palace said yesterday: \"There's definitely a ghost here - lots of people have seen things - so there's plenty of interest in how this goes.\" The ghost hunt has been organised by the University of Hertfordshire, formerly Hatfield Polytechnic, as part of a series of events to mark the 460th anniversary of the beginning of Catherine's 18 months as queen, a reign which ended after what were almost certainly trumped-up adultery charges were brought. The Tudor equivalent of a London \"Sloane\", the 20-year-old was convicted of sending passionate love letters to an admirer, although it has since emerged that she could barely write her own name. Hampton Court, run by the government's royal palace's department, said there had been an increase in possible paranormal incidents during the approach to the anniversary. Generally considered the most spirited of Henry VIII wives, Catherine was imprisoned in the palace by the Thames for her last days before being taken to the Tower of London for execution. Dr Richard Wiseman, lecturer in psychological phenomena at Hertfordshire, said the young queen was supposed to have made a desperate escape attempt before being taken to the block. Accounts describe her leaving Hampton Court insufficiently disguised and being dragged back screaming after failing to reach the king to plead for mercy. The research will involve visitors to the palace over the bank holiday weekend, when it is hoped that increased numbers of tourists will provide a range of \"psychic sensitivities\" which could pinpoint areas where the queen's fate triggers hauntings, whether real or imagined. Dr Wiseman will use thermal imaging to locate possible \"cold spots\" and instruments to measure changes in the magnetic field of the gallery to cover as many other causes of staff disquiet as possible. He will explain his experiments three times daily to visitors, who will also have the chance to join a royal \"goosepimples trail\".",

      "bodyText": "A convicted murderer is likely to walk free and a man accused of raping a 66-year-old woman has been acquitted despite overwhelming DNA evidence pinpointing them as the perpetrators of the crimes. The court of appeal ruled yesterday that the men could not be convicted because the DNA samples that linked them to the crimes could not be used because they were gathered in connection with other, unrelated offences. The shadow Home Office minister David Lidington last night called for an urgent review of laws on DNA evidence after three judges ruled that the two men could not be convicted despite \"compelling\" evidence against them. Section 64 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act decrees that DNA samples taken from suspects must be destroyed if they are acquitted or the case discontinued, and cannot be used in any other investigation. The two men, whose cases are not related, were charged after DNA samples taken during investigations into other crimes linked one to the rape of a 66-year-old woman and the other to the murder of a 79-year-old man. But the appeal court judges said they could not be found guilty because the samples that led detectives to the men were taken when they faced other charges of which they were never convicted. \"I hope that the government will look carefully at the appeal court's decision and consider whether a change in the law is necessary,\" Mr Lidington said. But a Home Office spokesman said: \"There are no immediate plans to change the regulations. The rules are quite clear. It's a fundamental civil liberty issue.\" Lord Justice Swinton Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Butterfield and Mrs Justice Rafferty, quashed the murder conviction of Michael Weir. The crown prosecution service was last night considering an appeal, but lawyers thought the House of Lords would be likely to follow the appeal court because parliament's wording of the legislation is unequivocal. Judges normally have discretion to allow evidence to be used even if it was illegally obtained, but the appeal court ruled that parliament never intended a court to exercise discretion over wrongly retained DNA samples. Weir had appealed against his conviction for murder, burglary and assault, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment at the Old Bailey in July 1999. He was linked to the murder of Leonard Harris in north London in January 1998 by a DNA sample taken after he was charged with drug offences in August 1997. But the drug charges were discontinued. Police made the connection after running a DNA profile from blood found on a glove left outside Harris's home through their database. Harris died nearly six months after the attack.

Weir was convicted after the Old Bailey judge ruled that the prosecution relied on evidence obtained from a second sample of blood when he was arrested for the murder rather than the sample that should have been destroyed. But without the first sample he would never have been linked to the murder scene. In the rape case, the attorney general referred the acquittal of the accused man, who was not named, to the court of appeal. A DNA profile obtained by taking swabs from the victim, who was raped in her bedroom in 1997 and bundled into a cupboard where she was found 18 hours later, was put on the national DNA database. When the accused was arrested for an unrelated burglary offence in January 1998, a DNA profile was obtained from a saliva sample. But in August that year the man was acquitted of the burglary.

The study, carried out by Mohammed M Ali from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Iqbal Shah from the World Health Organisation, provides the first accurate data on child mortality in Iraq since 1991. The fieldwork was carried out by the United Nations children's organisation Unicef, with the permission of the Iraqi government. The researchers compared the death rates among babies and children under five years old in the autonomous (northern Kurdish) region with those in the rest of the country. They found a marked difference between the Kurdish area, which is benefiting from the oil-for-food programme, and the rest of Iraq, which is not. In the Kurdish area, child mortality rates have improved; between 1994 and 1999, infant mortality declined from 64 to 59 per 1,000 live births and the under-five mortality ratio fell from 80 to 72 per 1,000. In the rest of Iraq, child mortality more than doubled during the sanctions period, rising from 47 per 1,000 live births during 1984-89 to 108 per 1,000 in 1994-99; under-five mortality rose from 56 to 131 per 1,000. The reports point to many critical factors undermining the health of the Iraqi population - particularly for those who live in rural areas. Hospitals and health clinics have had little or no maintenance since 1991 and their work has been hampered by shortages of power and water. Before sanctions, 90% of urban families and 70% of those in rural areas had access to safe water supplies. Now, that can be said of only half those living in towns and a third of those in the countryside. Dr Ali said yesterday that he and his fellow researcher were not trying to draw conclusions from their work. \"We have showed that the increase in child mortality coincides with the start of sanctions,\" he said. Since sanctions were imposed, there has also been an increase in malnutrition for mothers and babies - from 3% to 11% of the population - and a rise in endemic diseases such as measles and diarrhoeal diseases.

Peter Kandela, a doctor who has just returned from the country, writes of what he calls the tragedy of Iraq in another Lancet article. \"Children who should be at school are scouring rubbish heaps and keeping cool in cesspits, and when they get ill there will be no treatment for them,\" he writes. \"These are the next generation; and who will blame those who survive to adulthood if they react with bitterness and fury against those they deem responsible?\" Two surveys were carried out for the study on child mortality and maternal mortality, the second of which is yet to be published.

Stung by a prominently published picture of a 14-year-old boy holding a British gun earlier this week, the Ministry of Defence insisted that a new consignment of weapons - including up to 10,000 self-loading rifles - supplied to Mr Kabbah's forces will be subjected to \"controlled release under the supervision of British officers\" in a 90-strong military training team. Some 7,500 British rifles were supplied to Mr Kabbah's forces last year as part of a \u00a310m weapons package. Aid agencies with first-hand knowledge of the situation in the west African country are deeply sceptical about claims that the distribution of the weapons can be controlled effectively. \"I don't think Britain's monitoring system will be sufficient,\" Antonio Cabral, the Catholic charity Cafod's programme officer for Sierra Leone, said yesterday. He said that children between 13 and 15 from the pro-government Kamajor militia were being integrated in the Sierra Leone army. \"It is almost impossible to police,\" Mr Cabral said. It would have been much better if Britain had given the weapons to UN forces, he added. The plight of child combatants - the UN estimates there are about 5,000 in Sierra Leone - was raised by the UN's general assembly on Thursday. A protocol to the UN convention on the rights of the child calls on governments to take \"all feasible measures\" to prevent soldiers under 18 from fighting. According to UN figures, more than 300,000 children under18 - and some as young as seven - are fighting in wars around the world, including in Sudan, Colombia, Angola, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. Amnesty yesterday urged the British government to build into its new \u00a320m arms and military training package to Sierra Leone \"stringent safeguards\" to prevent the further recruitment of child soldiers, and \"firm guarantees\" from the Kabbah government that British arms would not be provided to pro-government forces that have committed human rights violations. \"In Sierra Leone there are risks and opportunities for the UK government,\" said Mark Lattimer , the organisation's communications director. He added: \"It has an opportunity to prevent child soldiering and guarantee that undisciplined and unaccountable fighters do not end up with British weapons.\" The New York-based Human Rights Watch is warning that British weapons may be made available to groups allied to the Sierra Leone government and known to have committed gross human rights abuses. \"There have also been recent, credible reports that child soldiers are being re- recruited and may as such be recipients of some of these arms,\" it said in a letter to the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon. Foreign Office officials concede that despite the conditions attached to the new supply of British rifles, there will always be a risk that they will be used by child soldiers. Iain Duncan Smith, the shadow defence secretary, told the government this week that it had \"yet to demonstrate that they will have any overall control over who uses these weapons. They should recognise that their action could backfire with dramatic results - including the possibility of these weapons being used against British soldiers.\" Last July's Lome peace accord specifically highlighted the question of child combatants and the Kabbah govern ment has repeatedly committed itself to ending the recruitment of children. Yet there has been no sign of this. Last November the government's civil defence forces admitted that its soldiers included some 200 children aged 15 to 18 and that there had been no effort to demobilise them. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, said that as a member of the UN security council and the former colonial power, Britain had a responsibility to Sierra Leone and UK troops should join the UN force. \"The UN cannot afford to fail in Sierra Leone,\" he said. \"Britain can best ensure success in Sierra Leone by being formally part of the force implementing a UN mandate.\"",

As minister for state security from 1957 until the regime's collapse in November 1989, he commanded a network of 92,000 professional spies and 170,000 voluntary informers and part-time snoops.</p> <p>Mielke's agents kept such a close watch on East Germany's 16m citizens that organised political opposition was almost impossible. Those identified as critics of the system could face imprisonment and torture, including fatal exposure to radiation. Although he spent five years in prison after German re-unification, he was never called to account for these crimes - or for the murder of hundreds of easterners who tried to escape to the west.</p> <p>Pedantic, bureaucratic and humourless, Mielke was viewed by many as an unprincipled, heartless party functionary, whose actions were motivated by nothing nobler than a desire to keep himself and his cronies in power. In fact, he was a life-long communist, whose political biography was shaped by his experience in the early decades of the last century.</p> <p>Born in the working-class Berlin district of Wedding, Mielke had a tough childhood, made grimmer by the early death of his mother. Like many of his neighbours in \"red Wedding\", his father favoured the communist KPD over the more moderate Social Democrats, and Mielke himself joined a communist youth group at the age of 12.</p> <p>As a gifted schoolboy, he won a state scholarship to one of Berlin's most prestigious schools but dropped out after only two years when his teachers told him that the educational deficit caused by his underprivileged background could not be overcome. The experience further radicalised the young communist and, when the KPD set up a paramilitary group for \"party self-defence\", he was among the first to join. Much of the group's time was spent playing a harmless cat-and-mouse game with the police, but it became deadly earnest for Mielke on August 9 1931, when he shot dead a policeman during a demonstration in the centre of Berlin. Aged only 23, he escaped to Belgium using identity papers supplied by the Soviets and, nine years later, went to the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Trained as a professional revolutionary at the Lenin school, Mielke returned to Germany after the second world war and, with other German communists who had spent the war years in Moscow, helped to establish the German Democratic Republic.</p> <p>Politically unsophisticated, with a mindset frozen in the prewar years - when communists saw Social Democrats as their worst enemies - Mielke was nonetheless a brilliant secret policeman. From the moment he took charge of the Stasi in 1957, the agency out-performed most of its western rivals.</p> <p>East Berlin planted an agent in the office of West German chancellor Willy Brandt and, as the German public has discovered in re cent months, its agents knew more about Helmut Kohl's financial misdemeanours than most of the former chancellor's closest aides. When Mielke celebrated his 80th birthday in 1987, the Communist party newspaper was still describing him as a national hero.</p> <p>Less than two years later, his entire world had collapsed. Five days before the fall of the Berlin Wall, as a million East Germans demonstrated against the government on Alexanderplatz, Mielke ordered his men to put aside weapons to defend themselves and their families.

      "bodyText": "Erich Mielke, who has died in Berlin aged 92, was feared and hated more than any other man in communist East Germany. As minister for state security from 1957 until the regime's collapse in November 1989, he commanded a network of 92,000 professional spies and 170,000 voluntary informers and part-time snoops. Mielke's agents kept such a close watch on East Germany's 16m citizens that organised political opposition was almost impossible. Those identified as critics of the system could face imprisonment and torture, including fatal exposure to radiation. Although he spent five years in prison after German re-unification, he was never called to account for these crimes - or for the murder of hundreds of easterners who tried to escape to the west. Pedantic, bureaucratic and humourless, Mielke was viewed by many as an unprincipled, heartless party functionary, whose actions were motivated by nothing nobler than a desire to keep himself and his cronies in power. In fact, he was a life-long communist, whose political biography was shaped by his experience in the early decades of the last century. Born in the working-class Berlin district of Wedding, Mielke had a tough childhood, made grimmer by the early death of his mother. Like many of his neighbours in \"red Wedding\", his father favoured the communist KPD over the more moderate Social Democrats, and Mielke himself joined a communist youth group at the age of 12. As a gifted schoolboy, he won a state scholarship to one of Berlin's most prestigious schools but dropped out after only two years when his teachers told him that the educational deficit caused by his underprivileged background could not be overcome. The experience further radicalised the young communist and, when the KPD set up a paramilitary group for \"party self-defence\", he was among the first to join. Much of the group's time was spent playing a harmless cat-and-mouse game with the police, but it became deadly earnest for Mielke on August 9 1931, when he shot dead a policeman during a demonstration in the centre of Berlin. Aged only 23, he escaped to Belgium using identity papers supplied by the Soviets and, nine years later, went to the Soviet Union. Trained as a professional revolutionary at the Lenin school, Mielke returned to Germany after the second world war and, with other German communists who had spent the war years in Moscow, helped to establish the German Democratic Republic. Politically unsophisticated, with a mindset frozen in the prewar years - when communists saw Social Democrats as their worst enemies - Mielke was nonetheless a brilliant secret policeman. From the moment he took charge of the Stasi in 1957, the agency out-performed most of its western rivals. East Berlin planted an agent in the office of West German chancellor Willy Brandt and, as the German public has discovered in re cent months, its agents knew more about Helmut Kohl's financial misdemeanours than most of the former chancellor's closest aides. When Mielke celebrated his 80th birthday in 1987, the Communist party newspaper was still describing him as a national hero. Less than two years later, his entire world had collapsed. Five days before the fall of the Berlin Wall, as a million East Germans demonstrated against the government on Alexanderplatz, Mielke ordered his men to put aside weapons to defend themselves and their families. On November 13 1989, as easterners streamed westwards through the newly-opened border, he attempted to justify himself with the words \"But I love everybody\". Mielke spent five months in prison on remand after he was charged in connection with the wall shootings, but his trial was postponed so he could be charged with the 1931 murder. He served four years of a six-year sentence for that crime, but was later judged too senile to face trial for his actions as a leader of the East German regime. After his release in 1998, he moved into a flat in a high-rise building in an eastern Berlin suburb with his wife, Gertrude, where he remained until his move last month to the nursing home where he died. Although Mielke never explained or excused his actions on behalf of the regime, he admitted in 1993 that he felt his life had been wasted. \"Millions have died for nothing,\" he said. \"Everything we fought for - it has all amounted to nothing.\" James Fitzmaurice Erich Mielke, secret policeman, born December 28 1907; died May 22 2000",

But the planning did not prevent ugly scenes of violence as activists dug up the grassy area of Parliament Square and daubed paint and graffiti on monuments, including the Cenotaph and a statue of Sir Winston Churchill.</p> <p>So far, 103 people have been arrested and charged.</p> <p>Pat, an assumed name, believes he could be number 104.</p> <p>Pat is from west Belfast and is now in his 30s. He works part time in the tourist industry. He is also a student, reading humanities at university.</p> <p>He claims to have no criminal record and said his parents, who were \"politically involved\", moved him to London to get him out of the political scene in Ireland.</p> <p>After leaving school, he spent a few years travelling, working on cruise ships. He came back \"needing some intellectual stimulus\".</p> <p><b> The 'new enemy'</b><br></p> <p>His history with Reclaim the Streets began, he said, in 1997. But at the start, he stayed mainly on the periphery.</p> <p>\"I did not like what I saw. I did not like elements that were attached to it.\" He would not expand further.</p> <p>He thought the police had a fundamental misunderstanding of Reclaim the Streets.</p> <p>\"There's no hierarchy, no real organisation. That scares them and the establishment. They feared the rave movement and the environmental movement, and the police regard RTS as the new enemy.</p> <p>\"This [movement] is very young, very disorganised. There is no method to it. A comprehensive ideology will follow in the next five to 10 years.</p> <p>\"I really believe that we (Reclaim the Streets) are a force of necessity in a democratic society, whether you agree with us or not. It is the cornerstone of any democratic system.</p> <p>\"We are keen and hungry to learn and believe we can make a change in the system, not in a communist way but in a humanistic way. Whether that is idealistic, utopian, I don't know. But I believe that we can make a change. This is the future of domestic protest.\"</p> <p>During the J18 demonstration last June, he said, he was one of three people who covered security cameras, carrying a ladder and putting bags over the lenses. He denied that he had anything to do with the damage to the Liffe building or other violence in the City.</p> <p>\"I told people to cover themselves as they went into Tube stations.\"</p> <p>Pat insisted that he had nothing to do with the May Day demonstration.</p> <p>\"I can verify that. The idea [stated by the press] that I was there in disguise is nonsense. I knew the police spotters would be out there. I knew they would specifically target me.</p> <p>\"I was working that day. I have my payslip. I have 100% proof of where I was. I was at work from 8am to 11pm.\"</p> <p>Although he was not arrested at the Euston riots on November 30 last year, he admits being violent there, overturning a police van. He said he gave a speech in the square outside Euston station which he thinks led the police to believe he is a ringleader.</p> <p>\"I said that the police feared us, and that was why so many police had been sent there. There were people on top of the police van. I'd wrapped a scarf around my face. I told them to get down and they did. It shocked me.</p> <p>\"But the only act of violence that I did - and I'm not proud of it - was push that van over [it was later set fire to].</p> <p>\"The problem caused by the violence is that it can be construed as devaluing the meaning of the protest. It also increases publicity for people in like-minded communities.</p> <p>\"There is a place for violence,\" he said, citing the suffragette movement.</p> <p>\"It has to be done from within, not from within the establishment, but from within society.\"</p> <p>His vision of the future of Britain is bleak. \"You're getting classes of people, electronically led, electronically educated, [within] the realms of a privileged class. Do you really think that people are going to accept that?</p> <p>\"All this talk about level playing fields and social inclusion. It's nonsense.</p> <p>\"People at the top of society have no idea about the deprivation at the bottom of society. New Labour has only been tinkering at the edges of society.</p> <p>\"The worst thing is that it does not make economic sense. It is not in our economic interests to have this deprivation in society. You do not have to be an anarchist or hardcore to realise that it's wrong.\"</p> <p>He claimed the police used the Daily Mail to build a case against him before he had even been charged or gone to court. \"I am resigned to the fact that at some point I will be lifted. They are going out on a limb specifically to target me. They have picked me out.\"</p> <p>The police admit their knowledge of Reclaim the Streets is limited. Officers have tried to set up meetings with the movement's leaders, but say they have been rebuffed.</p> <p>British Transport Police confirmed last night they wanted to question Pat about the disturbances at Euston station last November. Thirty-one people have already been charged.</p> <p>\"We have good video evidence of him. It's pretty clear that he is organising what is going on,\" said a spokesman. \"We never said to the Daily Mail that he was called The General.</p> <p>\"We don't have any evidence that he was at the May Day riots. But we are sure about Euston.\"</p> <p>Told of Pat's claims of innocence, another police source said: \"Well, he would say that, wouldn't he?\"</p> <p><b>The following are edited extracts of a diary kept by \"Pat\" and seen by the Guardian</b></p> <p><b> November 30</b></p> <p>I knew for weeks before that I would be attending the demonstrations at Euston. Arrived early ahead of the protest march.</p> <p>The feeling of strength and self-empowerment derived from being among people who share a widespread vision and belief that we need radically to change society's governing ideals and ethos/status quo, if we are to progress peacefully and meaningfully into the millennium - a country at peace with itself and confident of its place in an ever changing world system.</p> <p>As the march approached Euston and the square filled, speakers were called for, and for the first time in my life I dared to gamble with myself. I was going to make my \"maiden speech\". If I recall events correctly (and I'm sure the Met will have a very different take on these events) I mainly spoke of the need for personal responsibility and that if we are to achieve our aims then the concept of DAP (Direct Action Politics) will have to be increased to a more effective and influential level.</p> <p>I say that what we are telling the CEOs and MDs of London's financial institutions is quite simply that we are putting you on notice - and every action you take is going to entail a counteraction on our part.

      "bodyText": "Pat is a wanted man. The police believe he was one of the masterminds of the Stop the City riots last June, the Euston demonstrations in November and the May Day riots in the Strand. His picture has been shown on Crimewatch and under the headline \"The General\" in the Daily Mail. Pat is now on the run. He believes he will be caught. He is also adamant he is being set up as a scapegoat. Before detectives catch up with him, he said, he wants to put the record straight. \"They are making out I am some sort of criminal mastermind. It's complete nonsense. I wasn't even at the May Day demonstrations. I can prove it categorically.\" He said he watched in disbelief as the publicity around him increased, but insisted he would not give himself up. Scotland Yard feared there would be trouble on May Day because of the two anti-capitalist riots which took place in London last November and June, and similar violent disturbances earlier this year in Washington and Seattle. The Metropolitan police cancelled all leave and launched a massive intelligence gathering operation. But the planning did not prevent ugly scenes of violence as activists dug up the grassy area of Parliament Square and daubed paint and graffiti on monuments, including the Cenotaph and a statue of Sir Winston Churchill. So far, 103 people have been arrested and charged. Pat, an assumed name, believes he could be number 104. Pat is from west Belfast and is now in his 30s. He works part time in the tourist industry. He is also a student, reading humanities at university. He claims to have no criminal record and said his parents, who were \"politically involved\", moved him to London to get him out of the political scene in Ireland. After leaving school, he spent a few years travelling, working on cruise ships. He came back \"needing some intellectual stimulus\". The 'new enemy' His history with Reclaim the Streets began, he said, in 1997. But at the start, he stayed mainly on the periphery. \"I did not like what I saw. I did not like elements that were attached to it.\" He would not expand further. He thought the police had a fundamental misunderstanding of Reclaim the Streets. \"There's no hierarchy, no real organisation. That scares them and the establishment. They feared the rave movement and the environmental movement, and the police regard RTS as the new enemy. \"This [movement] is very young, very disorganised. There is no method to it. A comprehensive ideology will follow in the next five to 10 years. \"I really believe that we (Reclaim the Streets) are a force of necessity in a democratic society, whether you agree with us or not. It is the cornerstone of any democratic system. \"We are keen and hungry to learn and believe we can make a change in the system, not in a communist way but in a humanistic way. Whether that is idealistic, utopian, I don't know. But I believe that we can make a change. This is the future of domestic protest.\" During the J18 demonstration last June, he said, he was one of three people who covered security cameras, carrying a ladder and putting bags over the lenses. He denied that he had anything to do with the damage to the Liffe building or other violence in the City. \"I told people to cover themselves as they went into Tube stations.\" Pat insisted that he had nothing to do with the May Day demonstration. \"I can verify that. The idea [stated by the press] that I was there in disguise is nonsense. I knew the police spotters would be out there. I knew they would specifically target me. \"I was working that day. I have my payslip. I have 100% proof of where I was. I was at work from 8am to 11pm.\" Although he was not arrested at the Euston riots on November 30 last year, he admits being violent there, overturning a police van. He said he gave a speech in the square outside Euston station which he thinks led the police to believe he is a ringleader. \"I said that the police feared us, and that was why so many police had been sent there. There were people on top of the police van. I'd wrapped a scarf around my face. I told them to get down and they did. It shocked me. \"But the only act of violence that I did - and I'm not proud of it - was push that van over [it was later set fire to]. \"The problem caused by the violence is that it can be construed as devaluing the meaning of the protest. It also increases publicity for people in like-minded communities. \"There is a place for violence,\" he said, citing the suffragette movement. \"It has to be done from within, not from within the establishment, but from within society.\" His vision of the future of Britain is bleak. \"You're getting classes of people, electronically led, electronically educated, [within] the realms of a privileged class. Do you really think that people are going to accept that? \"All this talk about level playing fields and social inclusion. It's nonsense. \"People at the top of society have no idea about the deprivation at the bottom of society. New Labour has only been tinkering at the edges of society. \"The worst thing is that it does not make economic sense. It is not in our economic interests to have this deprivation in society. You do not have to be an anarchist or hardcore to realise that it's wrong.\" He claimed the police used the Daily Mail to build a case against him before he had even been charged or gone to court. \"I am resigned to the fact that at some point I will be lifted. They are going out on a limb specifically to target me. They have picked me out.\" The police admit their knowledge of Reclaim the Streets is limited. Officers have tried to set up meetings with the movement's leaders, but say they have been rebuffed. British Transport Police confirmed last night they wanted to question Pat about the disturbances at Euston station last November. Thirty-one people have already been charged. \"We have good video evidence of him. It's pretty clear that he is organising what is going on,\" said a spokesman. \"We never said to the Daily Mail that he was called The General. \"We don't have any evidence that he was at the May Day riots. But we are sure about Euston.\" Told of Pat's claims of innocence, another police source said: \"Well, he would say that, wouldn't he?\" The following are edited extracts of a diary kept by \"Pat\" and seen by the Guardian November 30 I knew for weeks before that I would be attending the demonstrations at Euston. Arrived early ahead of the protest march. The feeling of strength and self-empowerment derived from being among people who share a widespread vision and belief that we need radically to change society's governing ideals and ethos/status quo, if we are to progress peacefully and meaningfully into the millennium - a country at peace with itself and confident of its place in an ever changing world system. As the march approached Euston and the square filled, speakers were called for, and for the first time in my life I dared to gamble with myself. I was going to make my \"maiden speech\". If I recall events correctly (and I'm sure the Met will have a very different take on these events) I mainly spoke of the need for personal responsibility and that if we are to achieve our aims then the concept of DAP (Direct Action Politics) will have to be increased to a more effective and influential level. I say that what we are telling the CEOs and MDs of London's financial institutions is quite simply that we are putting you on notice - and every action you take is going to entail a counteraction on our part. If we have to isolate you, stigmatise you and make you a social outcast in our society, so be it! It all ends in violence, and to summarise Rousseau, when the system refuses to see the injustices it inflicts on the citizenry as a whole for the benefit of the minority, then it's time for a change. The direction and methods of that change have yet to be decided. May 1 Well, it kicked off as to be expected, the minority viewpoint gets all the mention, McDonald's gets trashed, some shit goes off and suddenly everyone's a terrorist! No more protest in the capital, they scream.

Next week sees the formation of the new entity, CGNU, and news that it will be included in the FTSE life assurance index (which carries a higher rating than the general insurance index where CGU had to sit), sparked a quick flurry of buying. The grey market price for CGNU added 47.5p to \u00a310.40p. Elsewhere, Semple Cochrane, a facilities management firm, crashed 42.5p to 80p after being warned that an independent review of the firm was likely to show a \"material\" reduction in assets. Dividend payments have been put on hold, new management has been appointed and the company is now looking at its \"strategic options\" - as well as talking to its bankers. Industrial materials group Morgan Crucible warned shareholders attending its annual meeting that first-half growth had been slower than anticipated, blaming exchange rates and margin pressures. The shares fell 23p to 219.5p. Antisoma , the biotech play, saw its shares bounce 29p to 100.5p after an independent committee overseeing study of its Theragyn ovarian cancer remedy said the recruitment of trial patients should be restarted. The stock plunged by 40% at the beginning of the week when the Phase III trials were halted after a study by a PhD student showed adverse effects from using a similar product.",

On Monday the cabinet office minister, Mo Mowlam, \"announced\" plans for a national confiscation agency, to seize the assets of convicted criminals, which were first detailed in a Home Office consultation paper in November 1998. This was followed by a plan for a new offence of corporate killing, which was put forward by the law commission in 1996, to give the prosecution the right to appeal against judge-directed acquittals, and by the reissue of advice to treat children under 18 involved in prostitution as victims. Although the introduction of victim impact statements was treated in some quarters as if Britain were adopting the American and Saudi Arabian practice of allowing the views of victims to determine the punishment, the Home Office made clear yesterday that judges and magistrates were not being asked to go down the road of \"victim-led justice\". The appeal court ruling on April 19 also warned the courts about limitations of victim impact statements, which it said were already a common feature of the sentencing process. \"A sentencer must not make assumptions, unsupported by evidence, about the effects of an offence on the victim.\" It went on to rule out asking the victim what sentence he or she thought should be passed but did add that \"if an offence had a particularly damaging or distressing effect upon a victim, that should be known to, and taken into account by, the court when passing sentence\". Mr Straw said yesterday that the national scheme would see victim impact statements produced in minor cases as well as the more serious ones and would ensure that the impact on the victim was taken into account of by police and crown prosecutors at a much earlier stage in their investigations. But the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, said the scheme risked jeopardising the courts' impartiality. \"This is a cynical tactic aimed at masking the reality of Jack Straw's failure to get a grip of law and order,\" she said.

According to one of the captives, some are close to suicide. Nine Malaysians, three Germans, two Finns, a French couple, two South Africans, a young Lebanese woman and two Filipinos will enter their sixth week in captivity on the island of Jolo tomorrow. They were snatched by Muslim separatists on April 23 from a Malaysian holiday resort. Two developments have prompted fears for the victims, who were either on holiday or at work in the resort when the terrorists struck. On Wednesday the German tabloid Bild published a photograph showing the leader of the rebels, Galib Andang, also known as \"Commander Robot\", with his arms around two of his captives - Werner and Renate Wallert from G\u00f6ttingen. All three were smiling. The paper asked what sort of pressure had been put on the Wallerts to agree to be photographed in this way. Mrs Wallert, 56, was giving a particularly unconvincing smile. She suffers from high blood pressure and had earlier been seen in video footage rocking to and fro with a fixed gaze and having her head held up as one of the other hostages poured water into her mouth. Though medication has since reached her, the images of her suffering have made a profound impact in Germany and put her release at the top of the negotiators' agenda. Interviews conducted by German and Filipino journalists at the kidnappers' hide-out have highlighted the less visible plight of some of the other captives. Mirko Johannen Risto from Finland said: \"There are those among the hostages who are suffering acute nervous exhaustion. They have nightmares and some are seriously considering suicide.\" A French hostage, Sonia Wendling, hinted at disputes over food. \"Now we have new rations,\" she said. \"We talked over this problem and now it is again OK within the group. Now it is better.\" However one of the other hostages said: \"We are still weak, tired and hungry.\" They were seized by the smaller and more radical of two guerrilla movements fighting for an independent Islamic state in the impoverished southern Philippines. Though the Abu Sayyaf (father of the sword) group claims political motivation, opponents say it is on the wrong side the line between guerrilla warfare and banditry. Its formal demands include the setting up of an independent Islamic state. Informally, Abu Sayyaf has asked for up to $2m (\u00a31.3m) just to free Mrs Wallert. Changes to the government's negotiating team and skirmishes between rebels and troops have combined to delay the talks. But Manila's chief negotiator, Robert Aventajado, was optimistic. \"I think the conditions are right. Abu Sayyaf trusts that the military will not attack, and the military is cooperating,\" he said. The government's spokesman meanwhile signalled a readiness to discuss ransom terms. \"We have to look at things realistically,\" said Ricardo Puno. \"I believe that, in the case of ransom money being demanded, we ought to discuss it.\" But the Philippines' foreign minister earlier cautioned against hopes of an early outcome. Domingo Siazon told envoys from Germany, France and Finland that previous kidnappings by Abu Sayyaf had lasted three to six months.

I wanted to go to Sussex, but they, with their own state school kind of snobbery, wanted the kudos of seeing me at least accepted at Oxford. I passed the exam and was called for interview. In common with every other state-schooler I met, I was interviewed by a young tutor and a postgraduate student - all the public schoolers we met were interviewed by the dean of the college.</p> <p>It was the first interview I had ever had; I was overawed and on my best behaviour. Not so the postgraduate, who took delight in making me blush by asking if I thought TS Eliot's line \"testimony of summer nights\" referred to used condoms. I refused to be daunted. To their evident distaste, I queried aspects of the course, comparing it unfavourably to the Sussex prospectus and was told that if I wanted to be \"a radical feminist marxist lesbian\" then I should go to Sussex.</p> <p>Nonetheless, they interviewed me a second time and I finally passed to the dean. The dean arrived 10 minutes late and informed me he could only see me for five minutes. After three days of being treated like a second-class citizen who should be desperate to win a place, all I wanted was to get away.</p> <p>The dean sent me the expected rejection letter, which I didn't care about, but with a sting which stuck for years - based on his five-minute interview, he informed me that \"English wasn't my subject\". Having been rejected by Oxford, I then found myself rejected out of hand by all but two of the other places I had applied to; a victim of another kind of Oxbridge snobbery. Happily for me, Sussex accepted me, and so, when I got my three As at A-level, I won the place I wanted. My only regret is that I allowed myself to be pushed through a process which was stacked against me and did nothing but leave my confidence in my own abilities unpleasantly, and unnecessarily, shaken.<br> <b>Cathy Savage</b><br> Brighton</p> <p>Gordon Brown is talking rubbish (Brown scorns Oxford elitism, May 26). My daughter comes from an ordinary background, went to a middle-of-the-road state comprehensive (45% A-C grades) and was encouraged to apply to Oxford. She was accepted after a two-day interview, but failed to achieve the required grades (nerves, illness, panic). On results day the university phoned her school and after discussing this with her teacher, confirmed her place. I assume they had recognised her potential at the interview and stuck by their belief in her potential.<br> <b> Ann Thomas</b><br> Bristol</p> <p>The answer to Alan and Lesley Fowler's question (Letters, May 25): why so few candidates from northern comprehensives get places at Oxford is that not many apply. The success rate of applicants once they've applied is, in most subjects, much the same across schools, sexes and regions. The reason why private schools take 10% of the whole secondary population and get 50% of Oxbridge places is that they produce 35% of the straight-A students, and supply 50% of the applicants to Oxbridge. The really deep inequity is a matter of social class; 80% of the children with the best results at GCSE - whatever sort of school they attend - come from social classes one and two, and you can't change that by tinkering with Oxbridge admissions. But if anyone has a recipe for taking undeveloped talent, and catching up 12 years of lost attainment in the three or four years we have our students for, I'd like to know it. <br> <b>Alan Ryan</b><br> Warden, New College, Oxford <a href=\"alan.ryan@new.oxford.ac.uk\">alan.ryan@new.oxford.ac.uk</a></p> <p>Alan Ryan must be aware of Halsey and McCrum's study of 6,000 straight-A students who applied to Oxford in 1994-98. Candidates from private schools were found to be 1.2 times more likely to be offered a place than state school students. Since the study was conducted by Oxford professors, I assume Mr Ryan will not attempt to dismiss it as silly \"myth making\". Admissions tutors need to equalise acceptance rates for students who do apply before lecturing others about their preconceptions of Oxford.<br> <b>Nicholas Shaw</b><br> London</p> <p>Laura Spence may well discover her gain is greater than her loss. I toyed with the idea of applying for Oxford, but as not one of its colleges had either the expertise or the facilities to offer the courses I wanted to follow, I decided against it. The University of Wales did. I was not disappointed. <br> <b>Paul Bryant-Quinn</b><br> Aberystwyth</p> <p>Why does Gordon Brown find it so shocking Laura Spence won a Harvard scholarship but not a place at Oxford? Harvard is an elite institution which aims to take the best students. The typical UK comprehensive is a more successful academic environment than its US counterpart, so it is unsurprising a student from our state system would compete well. We should celebrate the success of comprehensive schools and expect to see more of our brightest young people go on to study abroad.<br> <b>David Firth </b><br> Kidlington, Oxfordshire</p> <p>A simple solution for Oxbridge admissions tutors faced with all those A grade candidates.

Nonetheless, they interviewed me a second time and I finally passed to the dean. The dean arrived 10 minutes late and informed me he could only see me for five minutes. After three days of being treated like a second-class citizen who should be desperate to win a place, all I wanted was to get away. The dean sent me the expected rejection letter, which I didn't care about, but with a sting which stuck for years - based on his five-minute interview, he informed me that \"English wasn't my subject\". Having been rejected by Oxford, I then found myself rejected out of hand by all but two of the other places I had applied to; a victim of another kind of Oxbridge snobbery. Happily for me, Sussex accepted me, and so, when I got my three As at A-level, I won the place I wanted. My only regret is that I allowed myself to be pushed through a process which was stacked against me and did nothing but leave my confidence in my own abilities unpleasantly, and unnecessarily, shaken. Cathy Savage Brighton Gordon Brown is talking rubbish (Brown scorns Oxford elitism, May 26). My daughter comes from an ordinary background, went to a middle-of-the-road state comprehensive (45% A-C grades) and was encouraged to apply to Oxford. She was accepted after a two-day interview, but failed to achieve the required grades (nerves, illness, panic). On results day the university phoned her school and after discussing this with her teacher, confirmed her place. I assume they had recognised her potential at the interview and stuck by their belief in her potential. Ann Thomas Bristol The answer to Alan and Lesley Fowler's question (Letters, May 25): why so few candidates from northern comprehensives get places at Oxford is that not many apply. The success rate of applicants once they've applied is, in most subjects, much the same across schools, sexes and regions. The reason why private schools take 10% of the whole secondary population and get 50% of Oxbridge places is that they produce 35% of the straight-A students, and supply 50% of the applicants to Oxbridge. The really deep inequity is a matter of social class; 80% of the children with the best results at GCSE - whatever sort of school they attend - come from social classes one and two, and you can't change that by tinkering with Oxbridge admissions. But if anyone has a recipe for taking undeveloped talent, and catching up 12 years of lost attainment in the three or four years we have our students for, I'd like to know it. Alan Ryan Warden, New College, Oxford alan.ryan@new.oxford.ac.uk Alan Ryan must be aware of Halsey and McCrum's study of 6,000 straight-A students who applied to Oxford in 1994-98. Candidates from private schools were found to be 1.2 times more likely to be offered a place than state school students. Since the study was conducted by Oxford professors, I assume Mr Ryan will not attempt to dismiss it as silly \"myth making\". Admissions tutors need to equalise acceptance rates for students who do apply before lecturing others about their preconceptions of Oxford. Nicholas Shaw London Laura Spence may well discover her gain is greater than her loss. I toyed with the idea of applying for Oxford, but as not one of its colleges had either the expertise or the facilities to offer the courses I wanted to follow, I decided against it. The University of Wales did. I was not disappointed. Paul Bryant-Quinn Aberystwyth Why does Gordon Brown find it so shocking Laura Spence won a Harvard scholarship but not a place at Oxford? Harvard is an elite institution which aims to take the best students. The typical UK comprehensive is a more successful academic environment than its US counterpart, so it is unsurprising a student from our state system would compete well. We should celebrate the success of comprehensive schools and expect to see more of our brightest young people go on to study abroad. David Firth Kidlington, Oxfordshire A simple solution for Oxbridge admissions tutors faced with all those A grade candidates. Make offers to those whose schools are lowest in the national league tables. They are bound to be more independent and persistent. Paula Casson Leicester",

      "byline": "Ekow Eshun",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I\u00d5m on my way to meet Dr Dre, and I have a song in my head. It\u00d5s called Fuck You, and in it Dre explains, in some detail, how he just wants \u00d2to fuck bad bitches\u00d3. The streets of Los Angeles glare white in the midday sun. I struggle into the plush recording studio where Dre is working. We talk for a while about his latest album, Dr Dre 2001.</p> <p>He recorded it, he tells me, because he felt misunderstood. \u00d2People definitely had the wrong idea about me. A lot of people were saying I was a mean cat, I disrespected women, a lotta bullshit, a lotta nonsense.\u00d3</p> <p>Can you blame them, I suggest, given your history of violence, an arrest record that makes for long, grim reading and a six-month prison sentence for parole violation. He reflects for a moment. \u00d2Of course I can\u00d5t blame them, but I\u00d5m a different person today. I can\u00d5t blame them, and that\u00d5s why I wanted to do this album and present myself in a new light \u00d1 the Dre of today.\u00d3</p> <p>For the record, then, the Dre of today is a relaxed, good-humoured, 35-year-old husband and father of two. He would like very much to put the misdemeanours of youth behind him, and make songs that highlight his maturity and sensitivity. Songs such as Fuck You. Strangely, there is less contradiction here than might seem apparent.</p> <p>It was while serving a six-month sentence in a Pasadena jail that Dre realised he\u00d5d had enough of hardcore hip-hop. As a producer and performer, he helped create the violent, invective-filled genre of gangsta rap, selling around 40 million records in the process. But along the way \u00d1 amid the parties and women and fast cars that also came with being Dr Dre \u00d1 he\u00d5d lost touch with himself, Andre Young. And he was tired. \u00d2I just said, let me do a whole 180 with my life. I don\u00d5t want to do any more negative hip-hop music, I can\u00d5t be talking about bitches and ho\u00d5s.\u00d3</p> <p>After prison, he got married and recorded a compilation album, Dr Dre Presents . . . The Aftermath, by unknown artists and producers. His contribution was a single track, Been There, Done That. In the wake of his jailhouse conversion, he now mocked rappers \u00d2who talk that hardcore shit coz that\u00d5s all they worth\u00d3. The album promised much. A fresh start for Dre and a career launch for the artists involved. It delivered neither. By commercial standards, the record sold acceptably. By Dre\u00d5s measure, it was a woeful failure. \u00d2People were expecting 7-Up and they got water,\u00d3 he conceded. \u00d2I wasn\u00d5t getting compliments from my fans.\u00d3 Rap critics began to suggest he\u00d5d lost his edge. He felt directionless and insecure. Finally, his wife gave him some advice. \u00d2She used to play my music before we even met, so she was like, \u00d4You need to get back in there and get back on that hardcore shit.\u00d5 It felt funny going in the studio talking about \u00d4this bitch\u00d5 and \u00d4this ho\u00d5 and how \u00d4I fucked this girl\u00d5 with a wife at home. But then, I have to look at it like entertainment, and I have a set fanbase, and there\u00d5s certain things they want to hear. They wanna hear Dre be Dre.\u00d3</p> <p>So Dr Dre 2001 delivers a well-established formula of hardcore rap to its audience. There are songs that fetishise guns and objectify women. Songs that celebrate marijuana use and low-rider cars. Despite this, it\u00d5s not simply a return to Dre\u00d5s gangsta past. It\u00d5s a more complex, reflective album. Where most hardcore rap affects a stony-faced emotional detachment, 2001 is at its strongest when Dre shows himself to be vulnerable. \u00d2Real gangstas don\u00d5t cry,\u00d3 he states on one song, \u00d2if that\u00d5s the truth then I\u00d5m realising I ain\u00d5t no gangsta.\u00d3 This is most notably so on The Message, a ballad that features the plaintive vocals of R&amp;B queen Mary J Blige and on which Dre mourns the death of his younger brother, Tyree, whose neck was broken in a fight three years ago.</p> <p>\u00d2Back in the day, I would never have made a song about my brother, but it was a very big part of my life, so I finally decided to give people that much more of me.\u00d3 Having tried unsuccessfully to divorce himself from what Dr Dre was, it seems he has chosen instead to broaden the possibilities of who Dr Dre can be. So much so that he gives me an indignant look when I refer to him as a gangsta rap artist, complaining that he doesn\u00d5t \u00d2even know where the term gangsta rap came from. I think the media invented it. We never came out and said, \u00d4Yo, what we do is gangsta rap\u00d5. What I make is hardcore hip-hop.\u00d3</p> <p>It\u00d5s easy to see why he insists on the distinction. Creatively, the music form never progressed far beyond an adolescent glee at its own ability to shock. Yet it\u00d5s ironic, too. Because, as part of the rap group NWA, Dre helped create gangsta rap and watched its impact spread across the globe. And, as a consequence of that breakthrough, he became lauded as the finest producer in rap. Newsweek called him \u00d2the Phil Spector of hip-hop\u00d3, and he won a Grammy award after his first solo album, The Chronic.</p> <p>But the timbre of our conversation has changed. Dre is progressively less relaxed the more we talk about those years of high acclaim. His broad 6ft 2in frame folds into itself, his knee bobs up and down nervily. Finally, it occurs to me that what he\u00d5s uncomfortable about has nothing to do with music. Rather, he\u00d5s edgy about where his success led. And how money and fame threatened to consume him as thoroughly, and fatally, as it did to so many of those around him.</p> <p>In the 60s, before it became famous through an NWA record, Compton was regarded as a neighbourhood of hope. With the phasing out of the city\u00d5s racist housing policies, black families fled the ghettos of Watts and headed en masse for Compton\u00d5s palm-tree-lined streets. Today, it has become a battleground in the vicious feud between LA\u00d5s two main black street gangs, the Bloods and the Crips. It was Andre Young\u00d5s love of music that kept him out of trouble in the neighbourhood. The last of his divorced mother\u00d5s three children, he was playing records from her extensive collection from as early as three years old. \u00d2I\u00d5d put on a record at my mother\u00d5s card parties, and people would scream out or get up and dance. I just loved stirring people up.\u00d3</p> <p>During high school, he deejayed at parties and clubs, and won a college scholarship to study mechanical drawing. Instead, though, he left school at 16 to join one of LA\u00d5s earliest rap groups, the World Class Wreckin\u00d5 Kru. It was an inauspicious start to his career. Inspired by the extravagant stage-gear of acts such as Parliament and Earth Wind &amp; Fire, the group wore flamboyant costumes that brought together the previously unconnected fields of hip-hop and high camp. Spandex jumpsuits, lace ruffs, off-the-shoulder capes and mascara featured heavily. Dre skulked at the back wearing eyeliner and, in a weak pun on his name, a surgeon\u00d5s gown and mask. He was determined that his next group would use rap as a vehicle for reality, not fantasy.</p> <p>Indeed, at the height of their notoriety, when the FBI was calling for their heads and police forces went on alert in advance of the group\u00d5s arrival in their town, NWA had a simple response to criticism: they were just reporters, telling the facts as they saw them. It was a seductive argument. But reportage follows principles of objectivity. And Niggaz With Attitude, the five-piece Dre founded with Eric \u00d2Eazy-E\u00d3 Wright and O\u00d5Shea \u00d2Ice Cube\u00d3 Jackson in 1986 were anything but dispassionate in their work.</p> <p>In the mid-80s, hip-hop was dominated by sober New York-based rap groups such as Public Enemy, the standard bearers for a black nationalist agenda subscribed to, at least in name, by most acts on the East Coast. Over on the West Coast, NWA had other ideas. Instead of Malcolm X or the Nation Of Islam, they turned for inspiration to the ghetto fiction of pimp-turned-novelist Iceberg Slim and the bawdy humour of Richard Pryor, Dolemite and Red Foxx. Like them, the group spun tales from the less salubrious aspects of black life. They rapped about drug deals gone wrong and drive-by shootings, gang warfare and police confrontations, grasping, materialist women (ho\u00d5s) and unfaithful lovers (bitches), all of which was set to an exhilarating, cinematic soundtrack produced by Dre. And they were delighted when the moral panic stirred by their debut album, Straight Outta Compton, released on Eazy-E\u00d5s Ruthless records in 1988, turned them into the most famous, and infamous, rappers in America.</p> <p>Outraged by songs such as Fuck Tha Police, politicians, civic leaders and, most spectacularly, the FBI accused the group of glorifying violence to sell records. Ultimately, however, NWA\u00d5s success was based on their shrewd understanding of modern media. Courting notoriety meant that they could bypass both radio and MTV, which anyway refused to play them. Instead, newspaper headlines, debates on CNN and Home Office raids on their record company\u00d5s UK HQ brought them worldwide attention.</p> <p>\u00d2After we started getting flak from FBI agents and people of that nature, we said, \u00d4Okay, we\u00d5re going to really fuck with you now,\u00d5\u00d3 says Dre gleefully. \u00d2So we started making the music even heavier.\u00d3 The strategy worked. Straight Outta Compton went gold in six weeks (600,000 record sales) then platinum (one million record sales), and after that double platinum. Niggaz 4 Life, the follow-up, went straight to number one in the US charts. Barely out of his teens, Dre was rich and famous. It was the start of his troubles.</p> <p>Estranged from Eazy-E\u00d5s Ruthless label following a dispute over management and finances, Dre began work on The Chronic, the solo album that would come to consolidate his reputation at the forefront of hip-hop. As in-house producer at Ruthless, he had already been responsible for a string of million-selling albums. In return, he rewarded himself with a lavish lifestyle that included an enormous French colonial-style house, numerous high-grade sports cars and a ceaseless round of parties. \u00d2My house was full of people all the time. You could come over on Sunday morning and there\u00d5s just people laying out on the floor asleep. Girls all over the place. I was spending money on a lot of cars, jewellery, apartments all over town. I probably bought somewhere between eight to 10 cars. Ferraris, I don\u00d5t know how many Mercedes, Corvettes . . . it was just dumb shit. I blew a lot of money. I was letting people in my life that were straight up there totally to see what they can get out of my pocket, and I wasn\u00d5t seeing this. It was just about the party to me, and you gotta have people around to have a party.\u00d3</p> <p>Insulated from criticism by his retinue of hangers-on, and with a reputation as a hardcore rapper to maintain, Dre began reacting to criticism with sudden, petulant rage. At a music-industry party in 1991, he attacked TV show host Dee Barnes after an uncomplimentary report about NWA had aired on her programme. \u00d2Dre picks me up by my hair and my ear,\u00d3 Barnes told the writer Ronin Ro, in his gangsta rap expos\u008e, Have Gun Will Travel. In terror, she dashed into the ladies\u00d5 washroom. Dre pursued her. \u00d2He grabs my hair again, throws me to the front of the bathroom. I just duck down and just . . . take my ass-whipping, you know what I mean? There\u00d5s nobody helping me and there\u00d5s no way in hell I could throw a punch at him.\u00d3 In response to the attack, Barnes filed a $20-million lawsuit, although the case was eventually settled out of court. Dre muttered to Rolling Stone, \u00d2I was in the wrong, but it\u00d5s not like I broke the bitch\u00d5s arm.\u00d3</p> <p>The Dee Barnes affair was only the prelude to a catalogue of misdemeanours during 1992. In June that year, Dre was fined $10,000 and placed under electronic house arrest for 90 days with a tagging device around his ankle. He had been found guilty of breaking the jaw of an aspirant rap producer, Damon Thomas. In October, he served another 30 days after pleading guilty to the battery of a police officer during a large brawl that took place in the lobby of a New Orleans hotel. Some events were beyond his control, though. He was shot in the legs after gunfire broke out at a party he was attending. And, following a raucous party of his own, the producer was forced to stand by and watch his grand house go up in flames. \u00d2We\u00d5d had a party at my house the night before. We had a barbecue, and the next day the coals from the barbecue were dumped in a trash can which was pushed up against the house,\u00d3 says Dre. \u00d2They set the house on fire. And boom, there you have it. House going up in smoke!\u00d3</p> <p>Post-NWA, Dre was now living the life he\u00d5d once only rapped about. And it was proving too much. \u00d2I was out of control,\u00d3 he admits. \u00d2I was wildin\u00d5 out, partying, women . . . I think the business, and all the fame and fortune, just sucked me in and I had to step back and see that I was ruining everything that I had worked so hard at building.\u00d3</p> <p>Frustrated by continued wrangling with Eazy-E, Dre co-founded a new label in 1992, Death Row. Within four years, it would be worth an estimated $200 million, becoming one of the most successful black-owned labels of all time. But before then, it became clear that the company had a major liability: Death Row\u00d5s other owner. Marion \u00d2Suge\u00d3 Knight was a 300lb, 6ft 3in former professional footballer-turned-businessman. He was also a convicted felon with gangster connections, whom ABC television described in 1996 as \u00d2the most dangerous man in music\u00d3. While Dre was the production brains of Death Row, Knight was its public face. At its inception, he talked of creating a label as successful and culturally important as Motown. In its early days, this didn\u00d5t seem like an idle boast.</p> <p>Death Row\u00d5s first release was The Chronic. Hailed as a masterpiece by critics, it marked Dre\u00d5s maturing as a producer and performer. Acutely well-crafted, the album updated the sensual, oleaginous funk of George Clinton for the hip-hop era. Like Straight Outta Compton, it was also a guide to the street life of LA. Instead of NWA\u00d5s menacing imagery, however, The Chronic imagined an urban Elysium of low-rider cars, poolside parties, bikini-clad girls and high-quality marijuana. True, there were an obligatory number of weapons brandished and insults hurled (although most of the latter were issued at Eazy-E), but there was also love. The album introduced the Death Row \u00d2family\u00d3 of new artists who shared a spirit of friendly collaboration on many of its tracks. They were to be the stars of the new Motown. Chief among them was Dre\u00d5s prot\u008eg\u008e, a tall, fine-featured rapper, whose laidback manner and hangdog expression had earned him the childhood nickname Snoopy. As Snoop Doggy Dogg, he became the label\u00d5s first home-grown star, with a debut album, Doggystyle, that outsold Dre\u00d5s. By 1996, The Chronic and Doggystyle had earned an estimated $50 million and $63 million in retail sales, respectively.</p> <p>None of this was enough for Suge Knight, though. As Death Row grew in strength, so too did his greed. Knight took to holding unconventional business meetings with rivals. To resolve Dre\u00d5s long-running feud with Eazy-E, he allegedly threatened the latter at gunpoint, forcing him to relinquish Ruthless\u00d5s rights to Dre\u00d5s work. Other record company executives shared similar tales of intimidation, and even outright assault. In 1992, Knight faced assault charges after the pistol-whipping of two brothers, George and Lynwood Stanley, in the offices of Death Row. Catching them using the office payphone, Knight beat them, ordered them to strip naked and then robbed them. They deserved their punishment, insisted the Death Row boss. He was waiting for a phone call.</p> <p>A climate of terror settled over the label\u00d5s Wilshire Boulevard offices. Members of the Piru Blood gang, an arm of the feared Bloods street gang that was friendly with Knight, took to hanging out there, swapping prison stories and shaking down staff for cash. They were also there to mete out summary justice on behalf of Knight. Subtitled The Spectacular Rise And Violent Fall Of Death Row Records, Ronin Ro\u00d5s Have Gun Will Travel describes, in gory detail, the disorder that reigned there: \u00d2If Suge felt someone was trying to cheat him, the offender would be dragged into a storeroom by his goons and pounded to a bloody pulp. Death Row employees went about their filing and faxing as blood-curdling shrieks filled the office. They saw the doorknob jerking, knowing that people were desperately trying to escape a beating, thinking, I\u00d5m trying to get out this motherfucking room that they done locked this door on!\u00d3</p> <p>The chaos within Death Row seemed indicative of deeper stresses in the hardcore hip-hop world. Gangsta rap was reaching critical mass. The once close-knit Death Row family fell into rivalrous camps. \u00d2It became, \u00d4What kinda car does this person have. I gotta get a better car than that\u00d5; \u00d4My house has to look better than this person\u00d5s house\u00d5,\u00d3 says Dre. \u00d2When the money started coming into play from Death Row, that\u00d5s when the problems just went haywire.\u00d3</p> <p>Worse followed. In 1995, the notoriously promiscuous Eazy-E died after contracting Aids. In 1996, Snoop Doggy Dogg stood trial for murder. He was acquitted. But that same year, Tupac Shakur, a recent signing to Death Row and one of rap\u00d5s brightest stars, was killed in a drive-by shooting. Sitting beside him in the same car, Suge Knight escaped largely unhurt. There was speculation that the shots were never intended for Shakur, but rather Knight. Two weeks later, the Death Row boss was behind bars after being caught on security camera taking part in the group beating of a member of the Crips street gang, sworn enemies of Knight\u00d5s associates, the Bloods. A serial offender with eight previous convictions, he had violated the terms of his probation received for assaulting the Stanley brothers. Knight was sentenced to nine years in jail. The FBI, IRS, DEA and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms immediately began joint investigations into Death Row on possible racketeering charges related to Knight\u00d5s alleged business links with the drug-dealing Piru Blood gang. Death Row\u00d5s grand dreams had melted into air.</p> <p>\u00d2In the beginning, it was all about Niggers coming up,\u00d3 commented Dre in the hip-hop magazine Blaze. \u00d2Then it turned into a fucking Don Corleone thing. It was like a movie. You come into his [Knight\u00d5s] office and can\u00d5t step on the carpet\u00d5s Death Row emblem and all that crazy shit. It didn\u00d5t need to escalate like that . . . I got tired of seeing engineers get they ass beat for rewinding a tape too far.\u00d3</p> <p>Dre says he decided to leave Death Row after going to jail. Arrested on a drunk-driving charge, he was found guilty of violating the parole he received for breaking Damon Thomas\u00d5s jaw. \u00d2To be honest, prison was probably the best thing that could have happened to me in my life,\u00d3 he says earnestly. \u00d2Everything was happening so fast, the success I was having, all the money coming in, all the girls, all the partying. I never had a chance to say, \u00d4Yo, what do I want my life to hold?\u00d5 I had to find myself. And it was crazy. I saw a confused individual. A guy that wasn\u00d5t sure what he really wanted out of life. It made me say, \u00d4Yo, man, fuck those streets, fuck everything that\u00d5s going on out there on those streets. Is this the life I wanna lead, or do I wanna be a businessman, be able to take care of my family, chill out, have fun and make money while I\u00d5m sleeping?\u00d5\u00d3</p> <p>Dre now lives with his wife, Nicole, and their two young sons on a $4.9-million estate in a gated community in the San Fernando Valley. He abandoned his stake in Death Row while it was still a force in the music industry, trading income for \u00d2peace of mind\u00d3. Ultimately, he believes his \u00d2real talent\u00d3 lies in producing, directing and scoring films. He has already written a screenplay based on his own life, called Please Listen To My Demo. Yet although he\u00d5s now a 20-year veteran of the music business, his career is far from over. In fact, it\u00d5s just enjoying its third swell.</p> <p>In 1996, Dre started his own label, Aftermath, backed by Interscope records, part of the entertainment conglomerate, Universal. Aftermath\u00d5s contract is due for renogotiation, and industry observers predict that it will net Dre a nine-figure sum. Following the disappointment of its first release, Dr Dre Presents . . . The Aftermath, the label is now thriving. Dr Dre 2001 has sold five million copies since November 1999 and, in 26-year-old white rapper Eminem, it also has a major new star. A skilled, darkly-comic performer from Detroit (born Marshall Mathers), Eminem\u00d5s records have sparked controversy for their warped reflections on sex, drugs and teen life. The response is an echo of the furore that surrounded NWA more than a decade earlier. Dre, who produced the rapper\u00d5s debut album, The Slim Shady LP, is amused. It\u00d5s easy to see why.</p> <p>In the years since Straight Outta Compton, real life, with its celebrity scandals and high-school shoot-outs, has worked hard to outgun even the most lurid fantasies of hardcore rap. Entertainment culture has responded by becoming more provocative and more sexualised, from Reservoir Dogs and Boogie Nights in the US to Gail Porter\u00d5s bare bottom projected on to the House of Commons in Britain. Under the circumstances, it\u00d5s difficult to argue that hardcore hip-hop, in particular, deserves to be excoriated. But it does raise a question. NWA are currently in the studio, recording a comeback album called Not These Niggaz Again, with Snoop Dogg replacing the late Eazy-E. But just what is there left for them to rebel against? \u00d2I know people are gonna be, like, \u00d4NWA started this whole genre of hardcore hip-hop or gangsta rap music \u00d1 what else are they gonna talk about?\u00d5 \u00d3 nods Dre. \u00d2But once we deliver the record and it\u00d5s hot, and it\u00d5s a record that you can buy and bump and just roll out and wild out to, what the album is about won\u00d5t matter.\u00d3 Besides, he counters, \u00d2I don\u00d5t think it\u00d5s easy to sell records when you\u00d5re just trying to shock and inflame. It\u00d5s been done a thousand times after NWA came, and nobody\u00d5s reached the success that we had.\u00d3</p> <p>Perhaps Dre\u00d5s real art is not in shock, then, but seduction. Like his heroes, Pryor, Iceberg Slim, Tarantino and Scorsese, he has remade the brute antagonisms of street life as beautiful, dissonant poetry. While critics of hardcore rap have concentrated on its lyrics, Dre has been more concerned with what it should feel like; with how it bumps and rolls. Knowing all the while that art shouldn\u00d5t aim simply to imitate life. But to outdo it</p> <p>Forgot About Dre, by Dr Dre featuring Emimem, is released on Interscope on May 27.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I\u00d5m on my way to meet Dr Dre, and I have a song in my head. It\u00d5s called Fuck You, and in it Dre explains, in some detail, how he just wants \u00d2to fuck bad bitches\u00d3. The streets of Los Angeles glare white in the midday sun. I struggle into the plush recording studio where Dre is working. We talk for a while about his latest album, Dr Dre 2001. He recorded it, he tells me, because he felt misunderstood. \u00d2People definitely had the wrong idea about me. A lot of people were saying I was a mean cat, I disrespected women, a lotta bullshit, a lotta nonsense.\u00d3 Can you blame them, I suggest, given your history of violence, an arrest record that makes for long, grim reading and a six-month prison sentence for parole violation. He reflects for a moment. \u00d2Of course I can\u00d5t blame them, but I\u00d5m a different person today. I can\u00d5t blame them, and that\u00d5s why I wanted to do this album and present myself in a new light \u00d1 the Dre of today.\u00d3 For the record, then, the Dre of today is a relaxed, good-humoured, 35-year-old husband and father of two. He would like very much to put the misdemeanours of youth behind him, and make songs that highlight his maturity and sensitivity. Songs such as Fuck You. Strangely, there is less contradiction here than might seem apparent. It was while serving a six-month sentence in a Pasadena jail that Dre realised he\u00d5d had enough of hardcore hip-hop. As a producer and performer, he helped create the violent, invective-filled genre of gangsta rap, selling around 40 million records in the process. But along the way \u00d1 amid the parties and women and fast cars that also came with being Dr Dre \u00d1 he\u00d5d lost touch with himself, Andre Young. And he was tired. \u00d2I just said, let me do a whole 180 with my life. I don\u00d5t want to do any more negative hip-hop music, I can\u00d5t be talking about bitches and ho\u00d5s.\u00d3 After prison, he got married and recorded a compilation album, Dr Dre Presents . . . The Aftermath, by unknown artists and producers. His contribution was a single track, Been There, Done That. In the wake of his jailhouse conversion, he now mocked rappers \u00d2who talk that hardcore shit coz that\u00d5s all they worth\u00d3. The album promised much. A fresh start for Dre and a career launch for the artists involved. It delivered neither. By commercial standards, the record sold acceptably. By Dre\u00d5s measure, it was a woeful failure. \u00d2People were expecting 7-Up and they got water,\u00d3 he conceded. \u00d2I wasn\u00d5t getting compliments from my fans.\u00d3 Rap critics began to suggest he\u00d5d lost his edge. He felt directionless and insecure. Finally, his wife gave him some advice. \u00d2She used to play my music before we even met, so she was like, \u00d4You need to get back in there and get back on that hardcore shit.\u00d5 It felt funny going in the studio talking about \u00d4this bitch\u00d5 and \u00d4this ho\u00d5 and how \u00d4I fucked this girl\u00d5 with a wife at home. But then, I have to look at it like entertainment, and I have a set fanbase, and there\u00d5s certain things they want to hear. They wanna hear Dre be Dre.\u00d3 So Dr Dre 2001 delivers a well-established formula of hardcore rap to its audience. There are songs that fetishise guns and objectify women. Songs that celebrate marijuana use and low-rider cars. Despite this, it\u00d5s not simply a return to Dre\u00d5s gangsta past. It\u00d5s a more complex, reflective album. Where most hardcore rap affects a stony-faced emotional detachment, 2001 is at its strongest when Dre shows himself to be vulnerable. \u00d2Real gangstas don\u00d5t cry,\u00d3 he states on one song, \u00d2if that\u00d5s the truth then I\u00d5m realising I ain\u00d5t no gangsta.\u00d3 This is most notably so on The Message, a ballad that features the plaintive vocals of R&amp;B queen Mary J Blige and on which Dre mourns the death of his younger brother, Tyree, whose neck was broken in a fight three years ago. \u00d2Back in the day, I would never have made a song about my brother, but it was a very big part of my life, so I finally decided to give people that much more of me.\u00d3 Having tried unsuccessfully to divorce himself from what Dr Dre was, it seems he has chosen instead to broaden the possibilities of who Dr Dre can be. So much so that he gives me an indignant look when I refer to him as a gangsta rap artist, complaining that he doesn\u00d5t \u00d2even know where the term gangsta rap came from. I think the media invented it. We never came out and said, \u00d4Yo, what we do is gangsta rap\u00d5. What I make is hardcore hip-hop.\u00d3 It\u00d5s easy to see why he insists on the distinction. Creatively, the music form never progressed far beyond an adolescent glee at its own ability to shock. Yet it\u00d5s ironic, too. Because, as part of the rap group NWA, Dre helped create gangsta rap and watched its impact spread across the globe. And, as a consequence of that breakthrough, he became lauded as the finest producer in rap. Newsweek called him \u00d2the Phil Spector of hip-hop\u00d3, and he won a Grammy award after his first solo album, The Chronic. But the timbre of our conversation has changed. Dre is progressively less relaxed the more we talk about those years of high acclaim. His broad 6ft 2in frame folds into itself, his knee bobs up and down nervily. Finally, it occurs to me that what he\u00d5s uncomfortable about has nothing to do with music. Rather, he\u00d5s edgy about where his success led. And how money and fame threatened to consume him as thoroughly, and fatally, as it did to so many of those around him. In the 60s, before it became famous through an NWA record, Compton was regarded as a neighbourhood of hope. With the phasing out of the city\u00d5s racist housing policies, black families fled the ghettos of Watts and headed en masse for Compton\u00d5s palm-tree-lined streets. Today, it has become a battleground in the vicious feud between LA\u00d5s two main black street gangs, the Bloods and the Crips. It was Andre Young\u00d5s love of music that kept him out of trouble in the neighbourhood. The last of his divorced mother\u00d5s three children, he was playing records from her extensive collection from as early as three years old. \u00d2I\u00d5d put on a record at my mother\u00d5s card parties, and people would scream out or get up and dance. I just loved stirring people up.\u00d3 During high school, he deejayed at parties and clubs, and won a college scholarship to study mechanical drawing. Instead, though, he left school at 16 to join one of LA\u00d5s earliest rap groups, the World Class Wreckin\u00d5 Kru. It was an inauspicious start to his career. Inspired by the extravagant stage-gear of acts such as Parliament and Earth Wind &amp; Fire, the group wore flamboyant costumes that brought together the previously unconnected fields of hip-hop and high camp. Spandex jumpsuits, lace ruffs, off-the-shoulder capes and mascara featured heavily. Dre skulked at the back wearing eyeliner and, in a weak pun on his name, a surgeon\u00d5s gown and mask. He was determined that his next group would use rap as a vehicle for reality, not fantasy. Indeed, at the height of their notoriety, when the FBI was calling for their heads and police forces went on alert in advance of the group\u00d5s arrival in their town, NWA had a simple response to criticism: they were just reporters, telling the facts as they saw them. It was a seductive argument. But reportage follows principles of objectivity. And Niggaz With Attitude, the five-piece Dre founded with Eric \u00d2Eazy-E\u00d3 Wright and O\u00d5Shea \u00d2Ice Cube\u00d3 Jackson in 1986 were anything but dispassionate in their work. In the mid-80s, hip-hop was dominated by sober New York-based rap groups such as Public Enemy, the standard bearers for a black nationalist agenda subscribed to, at least in name, by most acts on the East Coast. Over on the West Coast, NWA had other ideas. Instead of Malcolm X or the Nation Of Islam, they turned for inspiration to the ghetto fiction of pimp-turned-novelist Iceberg Slim and the bawdy humour of Richard Pryor, Dolemite and Red Foxx. Like them, the group spun tales from the less salubrious aspects of black life. They rapped about drug deals gone wrong and drive-by shootings, gang warfare and police confrontations, grasping, materialist women (ho\u00d5s) and unfaithful lovers (bitches), all of which was set to an exhilarating, cinematic soundtrack produced by Dre. And they were delighted when the moral panic stirred by their debut album, Straight Outta Compton, released on Eazy-E\u00d5s Ruthless records in 1988, turned them into the most famous, and infamous, rappers in America. Outraged by songs such as Fuck Tha Police, politicians, civic leaders and, most spectacularly, the FBI accused the group of glorifying violence to sell records. Ultimately, however, NWA\u00d5s success was based on their shrewd understanding of modern media. Courting notoriety meant that they could bypass both radio and MTV, which anyway refused to play them. Instead, newspaper headlines, debates on CNN and Home Office raids on their record company\u00d5s UK HQ brought them worldwide attention. \u00d2After we started getting flak from FBI agents and people of that nature, we said, \u00d4Okay, we\u00d5re going to really fuck with you now,\u00d5\u00d3 says Dre gleefully. \u00d2So we started making the music even heavier.\u00d3 The strategy worked. Straight Outta Compton went gold in six weeks (600,000 record sales) then platinum (one million record sales), and after that double platinum. Niggaz 4 Life, the follow-up, went straight to number one in the US charts. Barely out of his teens, Dre was rich and famous. It was the start of his troubles. Estranged from Eazy-E\u00d5s Ruthless label following a dispute over management and finances, Dre began work on The Chronic, the solo album that would come to consolidate his reputation at the forefront of hip-hop. As in-house producer at Ruthless, he had already been responsible for a string of million-selling albums. In return, he rewarded himself with a lavish lifestyle that included an enormous French colonial-style house, numerous high-grade sports cars and a ceaseless round of parties. \u00d2My house was full of people all the time. You could come over on Sunday morning and there\u00d5s just people laying out on the floor asleep. Girls all over the place. I was spending money on a lot of cars, jewellery, apartments all over town. I probably bought somewhere between eight to 10 cars. Ferraris, I don\u00d5t know how many Mercedes, Corvettes . . . it was just dumb shit. I blew a lot of money. I was letting people in my life that were straight up there totally to see what they can get out of my pocket, and I wasn\u00d5t seeing this. It was just about the party to me, and you gotta have people around to have a party.\u00d3 Insulated from criticism by his retinue of hangers-on, and with a reputation as a hardcore rapper to maintain, Dre began reacting to criticism with sudden, petulant rage. At a music-industry party in 1991, he attacked TV show host Dee Barnes after an uncomplimentary report about NWA had aired on her programme. \u00d2Dre picks me up by my hair and my ear,\u00d3 Barnes told the writer Ronin Ro, in his gangsta rap expos\u008e, Have Gun Will Travel. In terror, she dashed into the ladies\u00d5 washroom. Dre pursued her. \u00d2He grabs my hair again, throws me to the front of the bathroom. I just duck down and just . . . take my ass-whipping, you know what I mean? There\u00d5s nobody helping me and there\u00d5s no way in hell I could throw a punch at him.\u00d3 In response to the attack, Barnes filed a $20-million lawsuit, although the case was eventually settled out of court. Dre muttered to Rolling Stone, \u00d2I was in the wrong, but it\u00d5s not like I broke the bitch\u00d5s arm.\u00d3 The Dee Barnes affair was only the prelude to a catalogue of misdemeanours during 1992. In June that year, Dre was fined $10,000 and placed under electronic house arrest for 90 days with a tagging device around his ankle. He had been found guilty of breaking the jaw of an aspirant rap producer, Damon Thomas. In October, he served another 30 days after pleading guilty to the battery of a police officer during a large brawl that took place in the lobby of a New Orleans hotel. Some events were beyond his control, though. He was shot in the legs after gunfire broke out at a party he was attending. And, following a raucous party of his own, the producer was forced to stand by and watch his grand house go up in flames. \u00d2We\u00d5d had a party at my house the night before. We had a barbecue, and the next day the coals from the barbecue were dumped in a trash can which was pushed up against the house,\u00d3 says Dre. \u00d2They set the house on fire. And boom, there you have it. House going up in smoke!\u00d3 Post-NWA, Dre was now living the life he\u00d5d once only rapped about. And it was proving too much. \u00d2I was out of control,\u00d3 he admits. \u00d2I was wildin\u00d5 out, partying, women . . . I think the business, and all the fame and fortune, just sucked me in and I had to step back and see that I was ruining everything that I had worked so hard at building.\u00d3 Frustrated by continued wrangling with Eazy-E, Dre co-founded a new label in 1992, Death Row. Within four years, it would be worth an estimated $200 million, becoming one of the most successful black-owned labels of all time. But before then, it became clear that the company had a major liability: Death Row\u00d5s other owner. Marion \u00d2Suge\u00d3 Knight was a 300lb, 6ft 3in former professional footballer-turned-businessman. He was also a convicted felon with gangster connections, whom ABC television described in 1996 as \u00d2the most dangerous man in music\u00d3. While Dre was the production brains of Death Row, Knight was its public face. At its inception, he talked of creating a label as successful and culturally important as Motown. In its early days, this didn\u00d5t seem like an idle boast. Death Row\u00d5s first release was The Chronic. Hailed as a masterpiece by critics, it marked Dre\u00d5s maturing as a producer and performer. Acutely well-crafted, the album updated the sensual, oleaginous funk of George Clinton for the hip-hop era. Like Straight Outta Compton, it was also a guide to the street life of LA. Instead of NWA\u00d5s menacing imagery, however, The Chronic imagined an urban Elysium of low-rider cars, poolside parties, bikini-clad girls and high-quality marijuana. True, there were an obligatory number of weapons brandished and insults hurled (although most of the latter were issued at Eazy-E), but there was also love. The album introduced the Death Row \u00d2family\u00d3 of new artists who shared a spirit of friendly collaboration on many of its tracks. They were to be the stars of the new Motown. Chief among them was Dre\u00d5s prot\u008eg\u008e, a tall, fine-featured rapper, whose laidback manner and hangdog expression had earned him the childhood nickname Snoopy. As Snoop Doggy Dogg, he became the label\u00d5s first home-grown star, with a debut album, Doggystyle, that outsold Dre\u00d5s. By 1996, The Chronic and Doggystyle had earned an estimated $50 million and $63 million in retail sales, respectively. None of this was enough for Suge Knight, though. As Death Row grew in strength, so too did his greed. Knight took to holding unconventional business meetings with rivals. To resolve Dre\u00d5s long-running feud with Eazy-E, he allegedly threatened the latter at gunpoint, forcing him to relinquish Ruthless\u00d5s rights to Dre\u00d5s work. Other record company executives shared similar tales of intimidation, and even outright assault. In 1992, Knight faced assault charges after the pistol-whipping of two brothers, George and Lynwood Stanley, in the offices of Death Row. Catching them using the office payphone, Knight beat them, ordered them to strip naked and then robbed them. They deserved their punishment, insisted the Death Row boss. He was waiting for a phone call. A climate of terror settled over the label\u00d5s Wilshire Boulevard offices. Members of the Piru Blood gang, an arm of the feared Bloods street gang that was friendly with Knight, took to hanging out there, swapping prison stories and shaking down staff for cash. They were also there to mete out summary justice on behalf of Knight. Subtitled The Spectacular Rise And Violent Fall Of Death Row Records, Ronin Ro\u00d5s Have Gun Will Travel describes, in gory detail, the disorder that reigned there: \u00d2If Suge felt someone was trying to cheat him, the offender would be dragged into a storeroom by his goons and pounded to a bloody pulp. Death Row employees went about their filing and faxing as blood-curdling shrieks filled the office. They saw the doorknob jerking, knowing that people were desperately trying to escape a beating, thinking, I\u00d5m trying to get out this motherfucking room that they done locked this door on!\u00d3 The chaos within Death Row seemed indicative of deeper stresses in the hardcore hip-hop world. Gangsta rap was reaching critical mass. The once close-knit Death Row family fell into rivalrous camps. \u00d2It became, \u00d4What kinda car does this person have. I gotta get a better car than that\u00d5; \u00d4My house has to look better than this person\u00d5s house\u00d5,\u00d3 says Dre. \u00d2When the money started coming into play from Death Row, that\u00d5s when the problems just went haywire.\u00d3 Worse followed. In 1995, the notoriously promiscuous Eazy-E died after contracting Aids. In 1996, Snoop Doggy Dogg stood trial for murder. He was acquitted. But that same year, Tupac Shakur, a recent signing to Death Row and one of rap\u00d5s brightest stars, was killed in a drive-by shooting. Sitting beside him in the same car, Suge Knight escaped largely unhurt. There was speculation that the shots were never intended for Shakur, but rather Knight. Two weeks later, the Death Row boss was behind bars after being caught on security camera taking part in the group beating of a member of the Crips street gang, sworn enemies of Knight\u00d5s associates, the Bloods. A serial offender with eight previous convictions, he had violated the terms of his probation received for assaulting the Stanley brothers. Knight was sentenced to nine years in jail. The FBI, IRS, DEA and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms immediately began joint investigations into Death Row on possible racketeering charges related to Knight\u00d5s alleged business links with the drug-dealing Piru Blood gang. Death Row\u00d5s grand dreams had melted into air. \u00d2In the beginning, it was all about Niggers coming up,\u00d3 commented Dre in the hip-hop magazine Blaze. \u00d2Then it turned into a fucking Don Corleone thing. It was like a movie. You come into his [Knight\u00d5s] office and can\u00d5t step on the carpet\u00d5s Death Row emblem and all that crazy shit. It didn\u00d5t need to escalate like that . . . I got tired of seeing engineers get they ass beat for rewinding a tape too far.\u00d3 Dre says he decided to leave Death Row after going to jail. Arrested on a drunk-driving charge, he was found guilty of violating the parole he received for breaking Damon Thomas\u00d5s jaw. \u00d2To be honest, prison was probably the best thing that could have happened to me in my life,\u00d3 he says earnestly. \u00d2Everything was happening so fast, the success I was having, all the money coming in, all the girls, all the partying. I never had a chance to say, \u00d4Yo, what do I want my life to hold?\u00d5 I had to find myself. And it was crazy. I saw a confused individual. A guy that wasn\u00d5t sure what he really wanted out of life. It made me say, \u00d4Yo, man, fuck those streets, fuck everything that\u00d5s going on out there on those streets. Is this the life I wanna lead, or do I wanna be a businessman, be able to take care of my family, chill out, have fun and make money while I\u00d5m sleeping?\u00d5\u00d3 Dre now lives with his wife, Nicole, and their two young sons on a $4.9-million estate in a gated community in the San Fernando Valley. He abandoned his stake in Death Row while it was still a force in the music industry, trading income for \u00d2peace of mind\u00d3. Ultimately, he believes his \u00d2real talent\u00d3 lies in producing, directing and scoring films. He has already written a screenplay based on his own life, called Please Listen To My Demo. Yet although he\u00d5s now a 20-year veteran of the music business, his career is far from over. In fact, it\u00d5s just enjoying its third swell. In 1996, Dre started his own label, Aftermath, backed by Interscope records, part of the entertainment conglomerate, Universal. Aftermath\u00d5s contract is due for renogotiation, and industry observers predict that it will net Dre a nine-figure sum. Following the disappointment of its first release, Dr Dre Presents . . . The Aftermath, the label is now thriving. Dr Dre 2001 has sold five million copies since November 1999 and, in 26-year-old white rapper Eminem, it also has a major new star. A skilled, darkly-comic performer from Detroit (born Marshall Mathers), Eminem\u00d5s records have sparked controversy for their warped reflections on sex, drugs and teen life. The response is an echo of the furore that surrounded NWA more than a decade earlier. Dre, who produced the rapper\u00d5s debut album, The Slim Shady LP, is amused. It\u00d5s easy to see why. In the years since Straight Outta Compton, real life, with its celebrity scandals and high-school shoot-outs, has worked hard to outgun even the most lurid fantasies of hardcore rap. Entertainment culture has responded by becoming more provocative and more sexualised, from Reservoir Dogs and Boogie Nights in the US to Gail Porter\u00d5s bare bottom projected on to the House of Commons in Britain. Under the circumstances, it\u00d5s difficult to argue that hardcore hip-hop, in particular, deserves to be excoriated. But it does raise a question. NWA are currently in the studio, recording a comeback album called Not These Niggaz Again, with Snoop Dogg replacing the late Eazy-E. But just what is there left for them to rebel against? \u00d2I know people are gonna be, like, \u00d4NWA started this whole genre of hardcore hip-hop or gangsta rap music \u00d1 what else are they gonna talk about?\u00d5 \u00d3 nods Dre. \u00d2But once we deliver the record and it\u00d5s hot, and it\u00d5s a record that you can buy and bump and just roll out and wild out to, what the album is about won\u00d5t matter.\u00d3 Besides, he counters, \u00d2I don\u00d5t think it\u00d5s easy to sell records when you\u00d5re just trying to shock and inflame. It\u00d5s been done a thousand times after NWA came, and nobody\u00d5s reached the success that we had.\u00d3 Perhaps Dre\u00d5s real art is not in shock, then, but seduction. Like his heroes, Pryor, Iceberg Slim, Tarantino and Scorsese, he has remade the brute antagonisms of street life as beautiful, dissonant poetry. While critics of hardcore rap have concentrated on its lyrics, Dre has been more concerned with what it should feel like; with how it bumps and rolls. Knowing all the while that art shouldn\u00d5t aim simply to imitate life. But to outdo it Forgot About Dre, by Dr Dre featuring Emimem, is released on Interscope on May 27.",

      "trailText": "<p>Stamp Show 2000 | The Dome | That Grant-Hurley split</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I popped into the Stamp Show 2000 at Earl's Court this week. It seemed more crowded than the Dome, though nobody I know seems to collect stamps any more. There were hardly any young persons, but plenty of middle-aged men in windcheaters and mud-coloured sports coats, plus a far higher percentage of beards than you'd find in the population as a whole. But it was still intensely nostalgic. </p> <p>When I was a teenage nerd, I too used to stand over some particularly choice stamp, moistening my lips with repressed desire, though I don't think I would ever have held a book of 10 current second-class stamps up to the light as if seeking imperfections, like some of these chaps at the Royal Mail display. There are still people in this country who get anxious about whether half a dozen 44p stamps come in a column block, or with guttering. </p> <p>But there are some great attractions. The wonderful Royal Collection, on show this week, reveals that George V must have been the most highly-ranked anorak in British history. You can alarm your friends by having a sheet of stamps printed up with your face attached - see mine above; it's perfectly good for postage, and will make people think for one appalling moment that you've inherited the throne. </p> <p>I liked the letter posted in May 1840 to a \"Miss Jones\" in Camberwell, possibly the first time a Penny Black was ever used. \"What a pity that they should make Victoria gummy!\", Miss Jones's swain wrote. He mailed the letter one day before stamps became legally usable, and some early Jobsworth with an eye on history surcharged her an extra penny. </p> <p>\u0095 So the Dome has more or less had it. Yes, it should have been better, and yes, it exemplified the Mandelson tenet that reality is the mere raw material for what you make it; all that matters is the spin. (Do you recall his star Dome attraction, \"Surfball - the game for a new millennium\", which didn't exist and was pure invention? It was cynical beyond belief). But, as I said at the time, my family and I enjoyed our visit, found plenty to engage us, and thought it good value. The kids didn't want to leave. </p> <p>But nothing could survive the stereophonic abuse from rightwing papers which couldn't stand the idea of a massive communal project paid from public funds, and the snobbery of the bien- pensant leftish elite, which thought it should be more like Tate Modern, with food supplied by Granita. Much of the comment was grotes- quely unfair, but it was so relentless that few would have wanted to make the effort. </p> <p>\u0095 The most poignant detail of the Grant-Hurley split is that Madame Tussauds wax museum has dropped plans to make one of her to go next to him, so depriving customers of the pleasure of hearing tourists say: \"I think I recognise Mick Hucknall, but why have they put him next to Ann Widdecombe?\" </p> <p> My agent phoned the other day to ask if I'd be considered for the voice-over in a new Hovis commercial. I won't do ads, for the obvious reason that as a journalist all you have to offer is your judgment, and who's going to believe that if it's for sale to the highest bidder? And why me? I suppose it's because I still have a Yorkshire inflection in the voice, which could easily be hammed up. \"Aye, when ah'm wi' mates in sum fancy pants west end restaurant eating foie gras for me snap, ah allus insists on a pint of mild and a thick slice of Hovis ter go wi'it. That's reet champion, that is!\" </p> <p>I wanted to find out how much I'd turned down - I know that when some actors get a voice-over, they often nip out and order a new Saab - but my agent couldn't discover. \"They found someone else,\" he told me. Brian Sewell, perhaps. </p> <p>\u0095 No, I didn't say all Welsh people are offensive. I'm not an idiot, and I had a very pleasant 24 hours in Cardiff the other day, meeting nothing but courtesy and warmth. I merely pointed out that some people use Welsh to talk about English-speakers behind their backs. It's the most obvious statement of fact. Alice Payal of Wimbledon had a similar experience on the island of Islay. Entering a cosy pub with friends, she found all heads turned to the invaders. \"Then conversation resumed, but, deliberately we felt, in Gaelic... we had the brilliant idea of continuing our conversation in French. You'd have thought we'd dropped a bomb! Outrage on every face.

      "bodyText": "I popped into the Stamp Show 2000 at Earl's Court this week. It seemed more crowded than the Dome, though nobody I know seems to collect stamps any more. There were hardly any young persons, but plenty of middle-aged men in windcheaters and mud-coloured sports coats, plus a far higher percentage of beards than you'd find in the population as a whole. But it was still intensely nostalgic. When I was a teenage nerd, I too used to stand over some particularly choice stamp, moistening my lips with repressed desire, though I don't think I would ever have held a book of 10 current second-class stamps up to the light as if seeking imperfections, like some of these chaps at the Royal Mail display. There are still people in this country who get anxious about whether half a dozen 44p stamps come in a column block, or with guttering. But there are some great attractions. The wonderful Royal Collection, on show this week, reveals that George V must have been the most highly-ranked anorak in British history. You can alarm your friends by having a sheet of stamps printed up with your face attached - see mine above; it's perfectly good for postage, and will make people think for one appalling moment that you've inherited the throne. I liked the letter posted in May 1840 to a \"Miss Jones\" in Camberwell, possibly the first time a Penny Black was ever used. \"What a pity that they should make Victoria gummy!\", Miss Jones's swain wrote. He mailed the letter one day before stamps became legally usable, and some early Jobsworth with an eye on history surcharged her an extra penny. \u0095 So the Dome has more or less had it. Yes, it should have been better, and yes, it exemplified the Mandelson tenet that reality is the mere raw material for what you make it; all that matters is the spin. (Do you recall his star Dome attraction, \"Surfball - the game for a new millennium\", which didn't exist and was pure invention? It was cynical beyond belief). But, as I said at the time, my family and I enjoyed our visit, found plenty to engage us, and thought it good value. The kids didn't want to leave. But nothing could survive the stereophonic abuse from rightwing papers which couldn't stand the idea of a massive communal project paid from public funds, and the snobbery of the bien- pensant leftish elite, which thought it should be more like Tate Modern, with food supplied by Granita. Much of the comment was grotes- quely unfair, but it was so relentless that few would have wanted to make the effort. \u0095 The most poignant detail of the Grant-Hurley split is that Madame Tussauds wax museum has dropped plans to make one of her to go next to him, so depriving customers of the pleasure of hearing tourists say: \"I think I recognise Mick Hucknall, but why have they put him next to Ann Widdecombe?\" My agent phoned the other day to ask if I'd be considered for the voice-over in a new Hovis commercial. I won't do ads, for the obvious reason that as a journalist all you have to offer is your judgment, and who's going to believe that if it's for sale to the highest bidder? And why me? I suppose it's because I still have a Yorkshire inflection in the voice, which could easily be hammed up. \"Aye, when ah'm wi' mates in sum fancy pants west end restaurant eating foie gras for me snap, ah allus insists on a pint of mild and a thick slice of Hovis ter go wi'it. That's reet champion, that is!\" I wanted to find out how much I'd turned down - I know that when some actors get a voice-over, they often nip out and order a new Saab - but my agent couldn't discover. \"They found someone else,\" he told me. Brian Sewell, perhaps. \u0095 No, I didn't say all Welsh people are offensive. I'm not an idiot, and I had a very pleasant 24 hours in Cardiff the other day, meeting nothing but courtesy and warmth. I merely pointed out that some people use Welsh to talk about English-speakers behind their backs. It's the most obvious statement of fact. Alice Payal of Wimbledon had a similar experience on the island of Islay. Entering a cosy pub with friends, she found all heads turned to the invaders. \"Then conversation resumed, but, deliberately we felt, in Gaelic... we had the brilliant idea of continuing our conversation in French. You'd have thought we'd dropped a bomb! Outrage on every face. 'How dare they?' written on each one.\" Roger Protz, whose excellent book on British pubs I mentioned last week, wrote to tell me about a pub in West Wales which Camra hopes to include in the next edition of the Good Beer Guide. \"The problem is, the owners are English and don't hide their antipathy to the Welsh, which takes some chutzpah in that part of the world.

It is one of a great library of documents discovered there. Until these were found, barely a scrap of papyrus existed from the two centuries immediately preceding the birth of Christ.

And the internet is how radio is increasingly going to be heard. This isn't futuristic hype, it's the abundant present. At a Radio Academy conference on radio and the web last week the figure of 20,000 stations was bandied about, though many of these are terrestrial stations simultaneously broadcasting on the web, rather than bespoke net stations. </p> <p>It has been estimated that 70% of American twentysomethings, when they use their computer, simultaneously listen to a CD or a radio station on it. The 40s British radio programme Music While You Work was meant to raise the spirits of factory workers. Now we can raise our own. </p> <p>Net radio listening can be problematic if the server is down or there's net congestion, but it is the place to hear exciting radio. <a href=\"http://www.radioqualia.va.com.au\">www.radioqualia.va.com.au</a> offers sound art made from the glitches that other radio stations have thrown away. Last week it also ran a strange tale about Mary, a colour scientist imprisoned in a black and white room by unidentified captors as an experiment. That's what it sometimes feels like listening to net radio, where there's no pretentiousness filter. </p> <p>But there's wit too. <a href=\"http://www.hearingvoices.com\">www.hearingvoices.com</a> bills itself as where journalism meets John Cage, while on Chicago's <a href=\"http://www.thislife.org\">www.thislife.org</a> I heard Take A Negro Home Tonight, a scam to drive rednecks demented. </p> <p>We bring to our net listening a BBC ear, and discover how many other ways there are of doing radio. Berkeley station's <a href=\"http://www.kpfa.org\">www.kpfa.org</a> was the first listener-sponsored radio in the world and, despite repeated cash crises and manage ment follies, still sounds fresh, if sometimes achingly West Coast. </p> <p>While traditional, formatted radio admits innovation only reluctantly, net radio embraces it. On <a href=\"http://www.gaialive.co.uk\">www.gaialive.co.uk</a> , DJs pay to host a show and play underground London music. </p> <p>It is easy to get overwhelmed. In the number and variety of radio stations we hear in Britain, we've gone, thanks to the web, from paucity to excess without passing enough. It's a radiophonic Babel, but guiding sites like <a href=\"http://www.live-radio.net\">www.live-radio.net</a> help, offering dozens of stations in virtually every country. Or there's the excellent World Radio Network (<a href=\"http://www.wrn.org\">www.wrn.org</a> ) re-broadcasting hundreds of public radio news services in English, Lao, Khmer, Burmese, Esperanto and more. </p> <p>Sure, there's dross. In The Legend of Castle Bodner, a half-hour award-winning drama from <a href=\"http://www.shoestrong.org\">www.shoestrong.org</a> about a romance in a haunted castle, the doors aren't the only thing to creak. And many net stations are just a branch of e-commerce, vehicles for the sale of CDs. </p> <p>But after surfing net radio, even cable and satellite TV looks restricted. And pirate radio - who needs it? The net is the audio equivalent of desktop publishing, allowing the small to compete with the big, without need of licence, dosh, or the constraints of regulation. Anthropologist Jo Tacchi suggests net radio will enfranchise black people traditionally excluded from mainstream radio, while also enabling local sounds to reach a global audience. </p> <p>The phone will make net radio mobile. Last week independent radio production house Somethin' Else signed deals with Ericsson to deliver interactive broadcast content for mobile phones, and with BT launched the XY Network broadcast entertainment service specially for Wap phones (<a href=\"http://www.xynetwork.com\">www.xynetwork.com</a> ). </p> <p>As for the BBC, the net allows expats to hear The Archers; but given the thousands of identical formatted stations out there, creating original quality programmes becomes even more imperative. </p> <p>So will net radio rival traditional stations? Will we ever listen to net radio while doing the washing-up? Don't expect an answer from me, for this is my last column as this paper's radio critic.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You didn't know you needed this - but trust me, you'll love it: on Radio Finland you can hear the news in Latin. Not on the tranny but on the internet (www.yle.fi/fbc/latini/). And the internet is how radio is increasingly going to be heard. This isn't futuristic hype, it's the abundant present. At a Radio Academy conference on radio and the web last week the figure of 20,000 stations was bandied about, though many of these are terrestrial stations simultaneously broadcasting on the web, rather than bespoke net stations. It has been estimated that 70% of American twentysomethings, when they use their computer, simultaneously listen to a CD or a radio station on it. The 40s British radio programme Music While You Work was meant to raise the spirits of factory workers. Now we can raise our own. Net radio listening can be problematic if the server is down or there's net congestion, but it is the place to hear exciting radio. www.radioqualia.va.com.au offers sound art made from the glitches that other radio stations have thrown away. Last week it also ran a strange tale about Mary, a colour scientist imprisoned in a black and white room by unidentified captors as an experiment. That's what it sometimes feels like listening to net radio, where there's no pretentiousness filter. But there's wit too. www.hearingvoices.com bills itself as where journalism meets John Cage, while on Chicago's www.thislife.org I heard Take A Negro Home Tonight, a scam to drive rednecks demented. We bring to our net listening a BBC ear, and discover how many other ways there are of doing radio. Berkeley station's www.kpfa.org was the first listener-sponsored radio in the world and, despite repeated cash crises and manage ment follies, still sounds fresh, if sometimes achingly West Coast. While traditional, formatted radio admits innovation only reluctantly, net radio embraces it. On www.gaialive.co.uk , DJs pay to host a show and play underground London music. It is easy to get overwhelmed. In the number and variety of radio stations we hear in Britain, we've gone, thanks to the web, from paucity to excess without passing enough. It's a radiophonic Babel, but guiding sites like www.live-radio.net help, offering dozens of stations in virtually every country. Or there's the excellent World Radio Network (www.wrn.org ) re-broadcasting hundreds of public radio news services in English, Lao, Khmer, Burmese, Esperanto and more. Sure, there's dross. In The Legend of Castle Bodner, a half-hour award-winning drama from www.shoestrong.org about a romance in a haunted castle, the doors aren't the only thing to creak. And many net stations are just a branch of e-commerce, vehicles for the sale of CDs. But after surfing net radio, even cable and satellite TV looks restricted. And pirate radio - who needs it? The net is the audio equivalent of desktop publishing, allowing the small to compete with the big, without need of licence, dosh, or the constraints of regulation. Anthropologist Jo Tacchi suggests net radio will enfranchise black people traditionally excluded from mainstream radio, while also enabling local sounds to reach a global audience. The phone will make net radio mobile. Last week independent radio production house Somethin' Else signed deals with Ericsson to deliver interactive broadcast content for mobile phones, and with BT launched the XY Network broadcast entertainment service specially for Wap phones (www.xynetwork.com ). As for the BBC, the net allows expats to hear The Archers; but given the thousands of identical formatted stations out there, creating original quality programmes becomes even more imperative. So will net radio rival traditional stations? Will we ever listen to net radio while doing the washing-up? Don't expect an answer from me, for this is my last column as this paper's radio critic.",

A potent way of doing so is through performance, especially in film and theatre, which reprise one of the most ancient of arts. One easily imagines humanity's remote ancestors gathered round the fire at night to recapitulate legends about gods, heroes and the hunt, either dancing and singing them, or watching poets recount them in the footlight of the flames under a proscenium of stars, gesticulating and changing voices to suit the story, encouraged by a firelit ring of spellbound eyes. </p> <p>With very little change, this describes what the late John Gielgud did in a career of consummate acting in which, occasionally, there was almost - but never quite - the flavour of ham. He had beautiful diction and an even more beautiful control of the meaning of his lines, and he easily passed the test implied in Cedric Hardwicke's dictum that \"when actors are talking, they are the servants of the dramatist.

They have the same relation to the text of a play as a musician does to a composer's score. They must grasp its possibilities of meaning, and they must know what an audience understands by another's ways of saying and seeming, moving and doing.

We talk of the roles we play, many of them simultaneously, as children and parents, colleagues and friends, customers and consumers, spectators and participants. We adjust our behaviour according to the company or circumstances we find ourselves in. As a result we may play a variety of parts in a single day, some very different from the others - and yet all of them are ourselves, all express facets of our identities, which are therefore more multiple, protean and evolving than we tend to think, even if the sum of their interactions yields a personality that is, within a range of variability, stable in its appearance to the outside world - like the sound of a chord made up of many notes. </p> <p> The acting of roles comes naturally in ordinary life, because ordinary life demands it; but it helps to know this latter fact, so that one can be prepared not just to play one's part when required, but to act a part if required. The words \"acting\" and \"action\" have the same root in the Latin verb ago, agere, egi, actum - to do, to drive, to lead. To play one's part, to have a role, is therefore to be active rather than passive; it is to take charge of oneself, and to make a difference of one's own choosing. </p> <p>Thinking of a person as a troupe of actors explains much.

All the previous shows, from the eight-hour United States of the early 80s onwards, have been built out of her own reminiscences and wry observations on American life. Anderson has said that the new piece is \"10% Melville, 90 per cent Laurie\", and that is how it seems, with themes from the book sparking anecdotes of her own, and the musical numbers using her words rather than the novelist's. </p> <p>There is no narrative thread running through the Songs and Stories, though the work does end with Ahab's death, the destruction of his ship the Pequod and the survival of the storyteller - \"Call me Ishmael\". The novel's major characters (though not Ishmael himself, nor the harpooner Queequeg) do appear, portrayed by a group of four singing actors in a mixture of set-piece musical numbers and rather archly choreographed stage pictures - another departure for Anderson, who has previously operated as a one-woman band, singing and playing everything. </p> <p>The attempt to broaden the theatrical canvas seems to me the major weakness in the piece. Anderson is at her best in anecdotal/confessional mode, one-to- one with the audience either singing her naggingly memorable songs or unfolding little stories over gently pulsating soundtracks. In Moby Dick those moments are the strong points of the show. There are mini-lectures on how whales communicate and how the sperm whale got its name, an engaging little anecdote about going to the Natural History Museum in South Kensington to talk to the head of the whale section, who turned out to be an expert on worms instead; but there are too few of them, especially musical ones. </p> <p>Her writing for the rest of the cast is unmemorable, apart from some striking numbers for Ahab - virtuosically played by Tom Nelis, complete with stovepipe hat and some pirouetting manoeuvres on his crutches. A mawkish MOR ballad for the Second Mate (Price Waldman) belongs in a second-rate musical rather than here - it is sentimental guff of a kind I thought Anderson was too discriminating to write - while some of the stage routines would not have embarrassed the Four Tops or the Platters in the early 60s. I can only hope they were meant to be tongue-in-cheek. </p> <p>The technology is slick and inventive, as you would expect from someone who has been pushing at the boundaries of the possible for 20 years now. Anderson's latest digital creation, the \"talking stick\", creates some extraordinary continuums of sampled sounds; the harmoniser, which allows her to deepen her voice or to sing in duet with herself, makes another appearance; and the ambient music, with its haloes of creaking ships and whale song, is strikingly atmospheric. The visuals are sometimes striking too - seascapes and underwater life, the pages of the novel flicking across the back wall, letters from them spinning through space, the actors using real-time video cameras to project their own likenesses around them. </p> <p>What the show needs most of all is a backbone.

(Race To The Right, May 20.)</p> <p>It's a pity the British ancestors of Griffin, and others like him, didn't think the same way when they invaded nearly every country outside of Europe all those centuries ago, acting as if it was their God-given right to take over other peoples' land and slaughter them out of existence. The Native Americans barely survived, and the Aborigines are now shadows of their former selves. What homeland do these people have now?</p> <p>I suspect the reason the British far right has never managed to re-invent itself as a legitimate political movement is because Britain has, for centuries, been made up of immigrants. Look deep enough into the history of many British people and you will see that they are descended from foreigners. And for all Griffin's race hatred, it didn't stop him from going to Libya to beg for money. <br><b> Joyce Cope</b> <br> Address supplied</p> <p>Until last Saturday, I was blissfully unaware that the BNP had a new leader, or of the fledgling F\u00fchrer's name. So why is the Guardian giving free publicity to right-wing fantasists that no one has ever heard of? Shame on you. <br><b> John Beardsmore</b> <br> Leicester</p> <p>Andrea Dworkin's views were fascinating (Take No Prisoners, May 13), once I was able to read them. My problem was not illiteracy but my (male) partner's preoccupation with the photographs of Ms Dworkin, which he found so repellent that he refused to read the article or to let me near the Weekend section.</p> <p>I know the feminist arguments about womens' appearance but, even so, one must wonder what was the purpose of so many photographs, some in close-up, of Ms Dworkin. I am sure that the photographer, and maybe the editor, were well aware of their likely impact upon readers, particularly men, and wonder whether they were included with the perhaps unconscious purpose of detracting from, and thus undermining, the disturbing substance of the excellent article, by producing a debate on Ms Dworkin's appearence. <br> <b> Dr Tanya Garrett</b> <br> Stafford</p> <p>As a lifelong purveyor of crisp sandwiches, I must categorically disagree with Mathew Fort (Love At First Bite, May 20). Not only is peanut butter a superb additive, but combined with strong cheddar cheese on a proper northern cob, with (Walkers) cheese-and-onion crisps, the result is sublime (especially when pregnant). <br> <b> Emma Byne</b> <br> London SW9</p> <p>Has anyone got a spare copy of Lost Consonants, number 144, I could swap for a duplicate of number 507? <br> <b> Julian Dunn</b> <br> <a href=\"http://eisendora@compuserve.com\" target=\"new\">eisendora@compuserve.com</a><br> Oxford</p> <p>Last week's Dear Weekend contained no mention whatsoever of Julie Burchill.

      "bodyText": "So, BNP leader Nick Griffin would be opposed to immigration if, and I quote, 'it meant they were going to take over the country and change it so we do not have a homeland - which every people needs if it's going to survive.' (Race To The Right, May 20.) It's a pity the British ancestors of Griffin, and others like him, didn't think the same way when they invaded nearly every country outside of Europe all those centuries ago, acting as if it was their God-given right to take over other peoples' land and slaughter them out of existence. The Native Americans barely survived, and the Aborigines are now shadows of their former selves. What homeland do these people have now? I suspect the reason the British far right has never managed to re-invent itself as a legitimate political movement is because Britain has, for centuries, been made up of immigrants. Look deep enough into the history of many British people and you will see that they are descended from foreigners. And for all Griffin's race hatred, it didn't stop him from going to Libya to beg for money. Joyce Cope Address supplied Until last Saturday, I was blissfully unaware that the BNP had a new leader, or of the fledgling F\u00fchrer's name. So why is the Guardian giving free publicity to right-wing fantasists that no one has ever heard of? Shame on you. John Beardsmore Leicester Andrea Dworkin's views were fascinating (Take No Prisoners, May 13), once I was able to read them. My problem was not illiteracy but my (male) partner's preoccupation with the photographs of Ms Dworkin, which he found so repellent that he refused to read the article or to let me near the Weekend section. I know the feminist arguments about womens' appearance but, even so, one must wonder what was the purpose of so many photographs, some in close-up, of Ms Dworkin. I am sure that the photographer, and maybe the editor, were well aware of their likely impact upon readers, particularly men, and wonder whether they were included with the perhaps unconscious purpose of detracting from, and thus undermining, the disturbing substance of the excellent article, by producing a debate on Ms Dworkin's appearence. Dr Tanya Garrett Stafford As a lifelong purveyor of crisp sandwiches, I must categorically disagree with Mathew Fort (Love At First Bite, May 20). Not only is peanut butter a superb additive, but combined with strong cheddar cheese on a proper northern cob, with (Walkers) cheese-and-onion crisps, the result is sublime (especially when pregnant). Emma Byne London SW9 Has anyone got a spare copy of Lost Consonants, number 144, I could swap for a duplicate of number 507? Julian Dunn eisendora@compuserve.com Oxford Last week's Dear Weekend contained no mention whatsoever of Julie Burchill. Isn't it time you replaced her with someone more controversial?

      "body": "<p>The taut skin of a plump red tomato buckles and rips, then oozes flesh, as a caterpillar begins to feed. A praying mantis clamps the candy-striped larva between its front legs. It tears into the turquoise underbelly, and a viscous bulb of tomato pulp erupts. Two mantises meet, dance, mount. They hold each other intensely, then suddenly her jaws are on his neck. Another mantis hops nervously around a slick, petrol-coloured tree frog. The frog yawns and gapes. Its puckered pink tongue flashes and the mantis is gone.</p> <p>Welcome to the food chain. Death nourishes. Sex kills. Hunger is brutal. It is these fundamentals of existence - eating, mating, dying - that are explored at their nexus in artist Catherine Chalmers' vivid photography of insects, amphibians and reptiles. Capturing small deaths in huge detail, her magnified prints allow a dignity and authority to species normally left under the carpet. Because size matters, not only in relationships between animals but in mediating our typically human responses to them. \"If it's smaller than your foot and you can step on it, then it seems okay that you do so,\" says Chalmers. \"Because it's small, you can step on an ant and walk away. If the ant were the size of a hippopotamus, our relationship with it would be entirely different.</p> <p>\"We have this idea that a lion is the predator and the zebra a prey, but a zebra can also kill a lion with one kick. The predator/prey scenario can very quickly reverse if the size proportion is wrong. So one of my praying mantises got attacked by a caterpillar that grew too big and they rolled around the set. When I put the tarantula and a full-grown mantis together, I realised it could have done some damage to the spider.\"</p> <p>Her exhibition prints deliberately confound perspective. The praying mantis is large enough to eat the viewer. Baby mice, fed to snakes and frogs, are the size of human newborns. The deaths of these \"pinkies\" - blind, hairless, vulnerable - are particularly chilling. The baby strains vainly, then relaxes into submission as the snake wraps itself around her tiny form, first caressing then gobbling.</p> <p>But is empathy genus-specific? Do we care about the fate of a mouse more than that of a caterpillar? Ambiguity is Chalmers' lexicon. \"As humans, we tend to root for the underdog,\" she says. \"There is one kill, but it depends on how you present the information. What animal you want to live and die is entirely subjective, from person to person and day to day.\"</p> <p>Raising her subjects from birth in her New York loft, Chalmers found her own relationship to them swinging between the maternal and the functional. \"I had lots of caterpillars and they bit me every time I picked them up. They also had this spectacularly beautiful death when they were ripped open, so when I fed them to the mantis I always looked forward to it.</p> <p>\"But the mantises were so difficult to keep: it took a mini-ecosystem to raise them. I had to give them live food, fruit flies when they're babies, then houseflies, then crickets, and they were all housed individually because they're cannibalistic. It would take me four hours to feed the brood, fly by fly. They have a head that moves on a neck much like ours, unlike most insects, where the head and body are fused. They look back at you with two big eyes. I got to really like them. When I first put one up on set with a tarantula, I procrastinated. I was attached to them and it really touched me.\"</p> <p>Her tarantula, however, was a docile creature. \"So the longer it didn't eat, the more I wanted it to, and I then began to worry about why the spider was rejecting food.\"</p> <p>The baby mice, which she nicknames \"nature's Cheerios\", elicited less sympathy: \"It didn't bother me with the pinkies. They couldn't see and it was over very quickly. But as my snake got to be eating full-grown mice, with fur and individual characteristics, the mouse would get scared. It realised that there was imminent danger and I hated doing that. So I felt totally different about the same animal at a different age.\"</p> <p>Chalmers, 41, studied engineering and designed toys before going to the Royal College of Art in London. Working with images of mythological creatures on canvas, she gradually became less interested in paint and more fascinated by the animals themselves. Composing pictures using materials from the natural world, she began to experiment with fly carcasses. Raising the flies herself, she realised they were far more interesting alive than dead.</p> <p>Although she knew little about the technicalities, the transparency of the photographic medium appealed: \"I borrowed a friend's macro lens, and when I looked at the flies against a white background I could see them for the first time in a way that I couldn't with my naked eye.\" Some of her series of photographs are published in a book, Food Chain: Encounters Between Mates, Predators, And Prey, and an exhibition of her photographs of roaches is currently on show in London.</p> <p>\"I was interested in the animals that are often referred to as the pest species - insects, rodents, some reptiles - that ecologically are essential to the earth's function but which we ignore or hate and kill. Houseflies interested me because they essentially live their lives with us. They live indoors in a house like humans, and have a parallel life of their own.\"</p> <p>We take these species seriously only in our desperation to eliminate them, she argues, pointing to the billions of dollars spent each year on pesticides. We despise the abundant, unaware that the way we live tends to increase the species we hate most, the ones that live off us. \"One of the things we don't like about insects is that they work on numbers. You can kill one fly, or 10, you can kill 100 roaches, but you're never going to get them all. There's always another one coming. It's that lack of control, and their ability to insert themselves into our lives whenever they want to, that bothers us. They live lives that seem to be the most opposite of ours - they eat their young, females eat males - and do all sorts of things that, to our mammalian code of ethics, are outrageous.\"</p> <p>Chalmers aims to confront our separation from the natural and the base instinctual. It's one thing to observe a food chain, she says, and another to be part of it. \"It's possible, in the west, to go through life without seeing any of the basic mechanisms of the natural world. We don't see the bird eat too many worms. It's easy to eat a hamburger and never have killed a cow.\"</p> <p>So she recreates in her studio that which exists in a world from which we are removed. \"I wanted to find out what it was like to see something so true to the functions of the earth but so removed from us as humans. It's very easy to have a connection with nature in the form of a cute little puppy. It's much more difficult to be in touch with the parts of nature from which we have worked throughout time to separate ourselves.\"</p> <p>But where does natural begin and unnatural end? Nowadays, natural means make-up, muesli, mineral water. \"It's one of those words whose definition changes throughout time. We would call a nature reserve natural because there are no buildings or roads there. But that reserve has been completely modified and managed by human beings.\"</p> <p>While her photographs portray the most natural of impulses, her subjects are pictured against a stark white background more reminiscent of a fashion shoot than traditional nature photography. \"I wanted a neutral place that was away from nature and away from us. The tree frogs are originally from Australia, the mantises from China. The caterpillars and the tomato were the only things indigenous to the US. They would never have met were it not for humans and, more specifically, me. I didn't come across them in the wild, so putting them back there was beside the point.\"</p> <p>But that neutral space was the locus of extreme events. \"At first, I was horrified that I was raising animals to eat each other. I felt that was beyond what someone should do. I'd never killed an animal before in my life, and throughout this project I never did, myself,\" she qualifies. Was there a sense that she was playing God among her glass cases? \"Every time I reached into the cage of mice, there would be a pile of little pinkies. They all looked the same and I could reach for one or, in a half-inch, reach for another. That was unsettling. I didn't like being the one to choose. Part of me felt bad playing God, and the other part felt I was doing a good job raising my snake.\"</p> <p>She takes a pragmatic view of the inevitable animal-rights concerns, arguing that she cares for her animals painstakingly well and simply feeds them what they require. We are all involved in a little bit of God-playing, she says. \"We have zoos all over the world that are used now for conservation and breeding programmes. We have got ourselves into a position where, in the natural world, things are so out of balance that there is a need for intervention on our part, trying to put it right, or to what we believe is supposed to be right.</p> <p>\"Should we have pets at all? Look what we've done to dogs. You buy a beagle, which has been entirely manipulated for our pleasure to look like that. Then we have a whole industry that takes cows and grinds them up into little dog pellets. At what point do you start interjecting a morality?\"</p> <p>And whose morality? The predator and the prey bring their own survival imperatives to the kill. We add a third human eye. We are both fascinated and repelled by violence among animals, but do we impose our own ethics upon them? \"That's certainly bound up in which animals we like and dislike. We tend to like other mammals, enjoy the ones that are soft, with big eyes, and tend not to like the ones with glassy eyes and scales. \"But saving the ecosystem of a certain species of worm may be more important because it preserves the forest in its entirety - the world could ecologically function very well without humans and function pretty well without mammals, but get rid of the insects and things would fall apart very quickly.\"</p> <p>What separates us from the subjects of these photographs: an accident of biology, the superiority of civilisation, a distrust of instinct? And whose side are we on? Perhaps it is because these creatures are most different from us that we like them least. But out of context and perspective, their stories resonate.

      "body": "<p>When the chap from the water company backed into Nayra's car in the office driveway some weeks ago, we should have rushed to lock the gates, call the police, file a report... But it was five o'clock, and we each had somewhere else we needed to be. He seemed okay. He said, \"Accidents happen, love, what can I say? The company'll take care of it.\" </p> <p>So even though Nayra narrowed her eyes and said he seemed like a bad lot and she didn't trust him, I put it down to a snooty, centuries-old suspicion of the working classes and came on all liberal: \"No, no, you heard what the man said. He's admitted responsibility. What else can he do?\" </p> <p>Well, plenty. The water company's insurers wrote to say that Nayra had backed into their car and that they'd be looking to us for their expenses. \"But the driver said...\" \"He's been fired.\" So we have a battle on our hands. Pam says she believes it's a \"Toasty\" versus \"Whitey\" thing. Nayra and I being the Toasties and the driver and - presumably - the water company being the Whiteys. </p> <p>The Toasty thing comes from a joke about how, when God made Man, He'd left the first batch in the oven too long and, seeing it was burned, He'd tucked it into a corner of Africa. With the second batch, He was over-careful, snatching it out before it was done, and He'd hidden the doughy result in northern Europe. The third time He got it just right, and the people of toasted complexion who'd come out He'd placed in His choice spot: the centre of the earth, the Mediterranean. </p> <p>Racist? Back when I lived at home, in Cairo, it had seemed harmless enough. Colour was not something hidden under an itchy blanket of pretended equality; it was in your face. Two teachers at Cairo University who shared the same name and department but not complexion, were referred to as \"Black Khalafallah\" and \"White Khalafallah\" when it was necessary to distinguish between them. And the description was just that: descriptive. I know, because when a phrase was reckoned to describe an area in which a person was \"challenged\", it was transmuted into something else. So my nanny, for example, whose right eye had been spectacularly ruined in childhood, was referred to in our street as \"She of the honoured eye\". </p> <p>What that may or may not tell us about \"labyrinthine\" eastern minds or manners is beside this particular point: Egyptians come in every shade, from the burnt chocolate of Aswan and Nuba, to the green eyes and golden hair of the Bedu of Sinai and the Western desert. Partly it's geography, partly history: the waves of varying races that over 7,000 years have been swept on to Egypt's shores have left their mark. But the majority is what you might call, well, \"toasty\". </p> <p>\"Toasty\" was what was printed on the baseball cap of a little dog-doll that my son acquired when he was two. Soon enough, a game evolved. Whenever anything went wrong, we asked, \"Who-o-o did that? It wasn't me it wasn't you - it must have been . . . TOASTY!\" Toasty could carry the wrongdoings of the world, for he came equipped with boxing gloves and a bungee-line, and could always dodge away and spring back punching. </p> <p>Oddly, just the other day, I found Toasty wedged behind the back of a sofa as I tried to return some order to the house after my son's first teenage \"party\". There he was, apprehensive, defensive, expecting no doubt to be blamed for the beer bottles in the bushes, the cigarette ends trodden into the lawn, the mud on the curtains - on the curtains! Was the Can-Can back in fashion? - the chewing-gum stuck to the cushions, the door-frame torn from the wall, the broken chairs . . . I shan't go on. I looked at him for a moment, but I knew it wasn't him.

      "bodyText": "When the chap from the water company backed into Nayra's car in the office driveway some weeks ago, we should have rushed to lock the gates, call the police, file a report... But it was five o'clock, and we each had somewhere else we needed to be. He seemed okay. He said, \"Accidents happen, love, what can I say? The company'll take care of it.\" So even though Nayra narrowed her eyes and said he seemed like a bad lot and she didn't trust him, I put it down to a snooty, centuries-old suspicion of the working classes and came on all liberal: \"No, no, you heard what the man said. He's admitted responsibility. What else can he do?\" Well, plenty. The water company's insurers wrote to say that Nayra had backed into their car and that they'd be looking to us for their expenses. \"But the driver said...\" \"He's been fired.\" So we have a battle on our hands. Pam says she believes it's a \"Toasty\" versus \"Whitey\" thing. Nayra and I being the Toasties and the driver and - presumably - the water company being the Whiteys. The Toasty thing comes from a joke about how, when God made Man, He'd left the first batch in the oven too long and, seeing it was burned, He'd tucked it into a corner of Africa. With the second batch, He was over-careful, snatching it out before it was done, and He'd hidden the doughy result in northern Europe. The third time He got it just right, and the people of toasted complexion who'd come out He'd placed in His choice spot: the centre of the earth, the Mediterranean. Racist? Back when I lived at home, in Cairo, it had seemed harmless enough. Colour was not something hidden under an itchy blanket of pretended equality; it was in your face. Two teachers at Cairo University who shared the same name and department but not complexion, were referred to as \"Black Khalafallah\" and \"White Khalafallah\" when it was necessary to distinguish between them. And the description was just that: descriptive. I know, because when a phrase was reckoned to describe an area in which a person was \"challenged\", it was transmuted into something else. So my nanny, for example, whose right eye had been spectacularly ruined in childhood, was referred to in our street as \"She of the honoured eye\". What that may or may not tell us about \"labyrinthine\" eastern minds or manners is beside this particular point: Egyptians come in every shade, from the burnt chocolate of Aswan and Nuba, to the green eyes and golden hair of the Bedu of Sinai and the Western desert. Partly it's geography, partly history: the waves of varying races that over 7,000 years have been swept on to Egypt's shores have left their mark. But the majority is what you might call, well, \"toasty\". \"Toasty\" was what was printed on the baseball cap of a little dog-doll that my son acquired when he was two. Soon enough, a game evolved. Whenever anything went wrong, we asked, \"Who-o-o did that? It wasn't me it wasn't you - it must have been . . . TOASTY!\" Toasty could carry the wrongdoings of the world, for he came equipped with boxing gloves and a bungee-line, and could always dodge away and spring back punching. Oddly, just the other day, I found Toasty wedged behind the back of a sofa as I tried to return some order to the house after my son's first teenage \"party\". There he was, apprehensive, defensive, expecting no doubt to be blamed for the beer bottles in the bushes, the cigarette ends trodden into the lawn, the mud on the curtains - on the curtains! Was the Can-Can back in fashion? - the chewing-gum stuck to the cushions, the door-frame torn from the wall, the broken chairs . . . I shan't go on. I looked at him for a moment, but I knew it wasn't him. To give him his due, my son had spent what was left of the night before disinfecting the basins, cleaning the floor, piling every towel in the house into the washing machine and had only stopped hammering at the chairs when yelled at that it was past two o'clock and were we NEVER to get any sleep?

      "body": "<p>The best thing about working from home is that you can earn a living dressed in flip-flops, underpants and a 15-year-old sweatshirt. Over the phone, no one has any idea how you look. You can compose demanding emails in a state of florid BO, send outraged faxes without getting out of your dressing gown and negotiate arcane contractual details with your scrotum peeping out from under that Italia '90 T-shirt you never quite got around to throwing away. The downside to this sartorial freedom is that you end up with a distinctly odd wardrobe: thousands of T-shirts, EU food-surplus-sized mountains of underwear, a fair old heap of jeans and . . . one suit. </p> <p>It's this suit that constitutes my problem. I feel about as much affection for it as I do for Phil Collins. This suit is my nemesis. I bought it four or five years ago on the grounds that, if you want to pass yourself off as an adult, you should at least possess one item of smart clothing. In an attempt to cling to a shred of dignity, I must conceal the name of the shop. All you need to know is, it was a bad choice . I was young, I was na\u00efve, I knew nothing about suits, so I just went into a high-street shop and bought one. I thought that was how it worked with suits. Only now, with a few more years of experience behind me, is it clear how wrong I was. </p> <p>It was a wedding invitation that prompted me to get mine out and dust it off again. I was prepared for a mildly unpleasant moment. But not for this. A quiet voice in the back of my head had been defying all logic, telling me that this time it would look good. Then I looked in the mirror. Swathes of grey cloth hung everywhere in giant folds. My armpits were held in a vice while every other part of my body disappeared behind a loose curtain of curiously bobbly cotton. Suddenly, I looked 1ft shorter and 1ft wider. </p> <p>The fact is, I have never looked good in suits. Sorry. Understatement. When I put on a suit, I look like a builder. If I'm lucky, I may just manage to look like a waiter. Usually, though, putting on any form of smart clothes strips 16 years of education off me in an instant. I'm not, as a rule, paranoid about my body. All the relevant parts of my anatomy are still in roughly the right places without too much unsightly shrinkage, swelling or sagging. My body, naked, is okay. My body half-naked in an Italia '90 T-shirt is okay. Even the flip-flops, underpants and sweatshirt thing doesn't look too bad. But when I put on a suit, I can hear Darwin pissing himself laughing at the things evolution does to people. </p> <p>The technical term is mesomorph. An ectomorph has a tall, bone-dominated physique; a mesomorph is the opposite - our bodies would still stand up if you took all the bones out. Stocky, I believe, is how lanky people describe us. A friend of mine, whose chest looks like a xylophone and who, when he wears a T-shirt, resembles a de-shelled tortoise, becomes a physical god the second he dons a suit. Even cheap suits give him an air of authority. In an expensive suit, he looks like he owns half of Switzerland. The direct result of being a mesomorph is that wedding invitations make you quake with fear. If a suit is required, and it almost always is, you are going to have to spend a whole day looking like your girlfriend's chauffeur. </p> <p> This suit that once made me look mildly foolish now looks as if it is bullying me. It has more personality than me, a distinctly bad personality. Inside it, I simply disappear as a credible human being. Now, if I'm lucky , I could pass myself off as a builder in this suit. Without fortune on my side, I'll look like I'm in fancy dress. </p> <p>The situation has to be rectified. If I buy another cheap suit, my position won't be improved. But if I buy an expensive suit, I risk even greater humiliation, because I know I will still look an idiot. To look an idiot in a suit from Burtons (no, that's not where I got mine) is the suit's fault. But imagine the humiliation if you put on some top-notch Paul Smith schmutter and still looked like a builder. If you can't look good in a designer suit, there is no debating who is to blame. You are like the tennis duffer with the \u00a3200 racket. Everyone who has spent less and looks better (ie, all those lanky bastard ectomorphs) can justly laugh at you and request a quotation for a spot of plastering. </p> <p>Which leaves me with a simple choice. I can either look cheap and stupid by going in the Phil Collins, or vain and laughable by heading for Bond Street. Or perhaps I can concoct some excuse for wearing an Italia '90 T-shirt to a wedding.

I did not vote for him, though I am, curiously, not entirely displeased that he got in, since he will at least sympathetically chew his Greens, whose opinion of London's air and streets I share. (That's Greens, by the way, not Greeks. I am sensitive about these matters, as there was a time when what I wrote was not always what you read - eight years ago, before the brilliant sub-editors who currently handle my copy, I was horrifed to discover, upon opening my copy of Weekend, that by the simple transposition of 'Sp' into 'D , I had become the first wine writer to discover Danish wine.) </p> <p>The celebratory wine is at Sainsbury, and it's at the price quoted above until June 3. It's a classic bubbly: crisp, clean, fresh, dry without austerity, gently fruity without fullness. A more elegant performer than hundreds of champagnes, it is the own-label Cava, and it rates 16.5 points out of 20. </p> <p>Sainsbury has several more bargains until June 3. Alteza 640 Oaked Viura (15.5 points, on offer at \u00a32.99), from Spain, offers an interesting range of dry flavours, from almonds to under-ripe melon and a hint of apple, but the texture of this white wine is very polished and gently plump. D'Istinto Sangiovese Merlot 1998 (14 points, on offer at \u00a32.99), from Sicily, is one of the tasty exceptions in the curate's egg that is the D Istinto wine range. It has fruit, tannins and acidity all in good working order. Sainsbury s Jumilla (15.5 points, on offer at \u00a32.99), from Spain, is very soft and sticky but unabashedly luxurious and flavoursome as it finishes. It's a terrific barbecue red. More so is Alteza 600 Old Vines Garnacha (16 points, on offer at \u00a33.49), from Spain. It parades burnt leaves and ripe plums, dry tannins, handsome acidity and very good fruit balance. It is a vivacious wine of more than passing quaffing interest. </p> <p>At Safeway, there is a splendid pair of red, own-label Bulgars. The Young Vatted Merlot 1999 (14.5 points, \u00a33.49) is all-embracingly fruity and delightfuly forward. The Bulgarian Country Red Merlot/Gamza 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a32.99) is joyously unpretentious and it veritably melts in the mouth. (From which the attentive reader will deduce little tannin attack.) </p> <p>At Tesco, there is a South American extravaganza going until June 6, which wipes 20% off the prices of all the following wines. Anubis Tempranillo 1999 (16 points, \u00a35.99), from Argentina, has a most individual approach to the old Spanish grape. It flaunts a quirky soft/hard fruit edge, a dry yet soft texture and a lilting finish - 100 selected Tescos have it (call 0800 505555 for details). Isla Negra Merlot 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a35.49), from Chile, presents deeply committed and sunnily-dispositioned fruit of gallant texture and great depth. There is a beautiful generosity to this wine and it s at 220 Tescos. 'Q' Cabernet Sauvignon 1998 (17 points, \u00a39.99), from Argentina, is exotically warm and gently spicy and very stylishly tannic. The cabernet clich\u00e9, blackcurrant, is given a new and exciting metaphoric definition here and, though you may say that a wine at a tenner ought to be exciting (and this one is), there are far too many wines that do demand this price of admission but which reveal a hackneyed plot. It, too, is at 100 Tescos. </p> <p>A superb red at Waitrose is Errazuriz Merlot 1999 (16 points, \u00a35.99), from Chile. Controlled to begin with, it gets ripe and rampant as it finishes with a marvellous surge of soft leathery fruit. Waitrose also has a mail-order side, the so-called Waitrose Direct (0800 188881), and one utterly scrumptious South African wine only available from there is Spice Route Flagship Merlot 1998. True, the Flagship notation jars, since this status is more elegant if conferred unstated, but this does not detract from the fruity colossus in the bottle which, upon opening, crushes the palate under a tsunami of flavours. It is a special-occasion merlot of massive depth, unwavering tannins and huge food compatibility. It costs, ouch, \u00a311.95 a bottle, but it s well worth 17 points.</p>",

It is a vivacious wine of more than passing quaffing interest. At Safeway, there is a splendid pair of red, own-label Bulgars. The Young Vatted Merlot 1999 (14.5 points, \u00a33.49) is all-embracingly fruity and delightfuly forward. The Bulgarian Country Red Merlot/Gamza 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a32.99) is joyously unpretentious and it veritably melts in the mouth. (From which the attentive reader will deduce little tannin attack.) At Tesco, there is a South American extravaganza going until June 6, which wipes 20% off the prices of all the following wines. Anubis Tempranillo 1999 (16 points, \u00a35.99), from Argentina, has a most individual approach to the old Spanish grape. It flaunts a quirky soft/hard fruit edge, a dry yet soft texture and a lilting finish - 100 selected Tescos have it (call 0800 505555 for details). Isla Negra Merlot 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a35.49), from Chile, presents deeply committed and sunnily-dispositioned fruit of gallant texture and great depth. There is a beautiful generosity to this wine and it s at 220 Tescos. 'Q' Cabernet Sauvignon 1998 (17 points, \u00a39.99), from Argentina, is exotically warm and gently spicy and very stylishly tannic. The cabernet clich\u00e9, blackcurrant, is given a new and exciting metaphoric definition here and, though you may say that a wine at a tenner ought to be exciting (and this one is), there are far too many wines that do demand this price of admission but which reveal a hackneyed plot. It, too, is at 100 Tescos. A superb red at Waitrose is Errazuriz Merlot 1999 (16 points, \u00a35.99), from Chile. Controlled to begin with, it gets ripe and rampant as it finishes with a marvellous surge of soft leathery fruit. Waitrose also has a mail-order side, the so-called Waitrose Direct (0800 188881), and one utterly scrumptious South African wine only available from there is Spice Route Flagship Merlot 1998. True, the Flagship notation jars, since this status is more elegant if conferred unstated, but this does not detract from the fruity colossus in the bottle which, upon opening, crushes the palate under a tsunami of flavours. It is a special-occasion merlot of massive depth, unwavering tannins and huge food compatibility. It costs, ouch, \u00a311.95 a bottle, but it s well worth 17 points.",

      "body": "<p>Peter wasn't really interested. Still, when you're eight, there are more important things than learning how to make pizza - winding up your sister, for one. Not that Peter doesn't like pizza; he just couldn't see why mum Angela wanted to master the finer points of dough-making and toppings. Why couldn't they get a take-out like everyone else?</p> <p>So, when Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, descended on the Dyers' Cambridge home, Peter did what young boys do best: he turned on the telly and pretended she wasn't there. Angela, 16-year-old Nan and lodger, Simeon, however, were tickled pink to see the KD crew. \"When I make pizza, there are a couple of disaster areas,\" Angela had pleaded. \"The dough is all sticky, and the more I knead the stickier it gets. As for toppings, I lack ideas.\" Being vegetarians, there was to be none of that prosciutto or salami, thank you. Just good, honest veg and cheese.</p> <p>No sooner had Rosie arrived, therefore, than she was off out the door again, to the health-food store, deli and grocers on nearby Mill Road. Once back at the Dyer homestead, she ordered this chopped and that sliced before commencing her dough masterclass. \"I'm going to show you two doughs,\" she said, \"a basic one, and a rich one, for calzone.\"</p> <p>Angela's expression suddenly switched from that of keen apprentice to terrified examinee, her fear becoming even more pronounced when Rosie began tipping out flour and yeast with reckless abandonment. \"Don't worry,\" said Rosie disarmingly, \"the measurements are all in the recipes. They're only an approximate guide, anyway. You only know a dough is right when it feels right. See, get your hands into this.\"</p> <p>Angela prodded the unfamiliar matter gingerly, then, realising that it wasn't going to bite, got well stuck in. \"It's lovely,\" she said. \"Not at all like my efforts. It's so . . . smooth.\"</p> <p>Time to leave the yeast to do its thing, exclaimed Rosie, and to get to grips with the vegetables. Midway through the ensuing maelstrom of frying, boiling and roasting, Dad David arrived home for his lunch. He didn't seem to notice the massed ranks in his usually peaceful kitchen, but that was because he was transfixed by the sight of Rosie holding a red pepper over an angry-looking gas flame. \"Is there an official term for that?\" he asked tentatively.</p> <p>\"Erm, charring?\" said Rosie, not altogether convincingly.</p> <p>Fortunately, David didn't press her on the matter, for his interest had switched to the myriad bowls of cooked and raw ingredients adorning the table. \"Am I allowed to nibble this?\" he asked, eying the courgettes, then shovelled a handful into his mouth before anyone could respond.</p> <p>Roused from his viewing by the sound of lips smacking, Peter piped up, \"Is it ready?\" Rosie's eyes gleamed - so he had been paying attention, after all. Then she smiled knowingly: \"Would you like to help me get the first pizza ready?\" she asked. \"Let's do a spring vegetable one.\" She had the poor boy hooked. Peter watched Rosie's every move as she rolled out a hunk of dough into a vague round (\"I don't believe in perfect circles at home,\" she said. \"It's a place to be natural\"), and then, following her instructions with an attentiveness that would have made his teachers weep with envy, he laid the pesto and veg on top. \"What next?\" he gasped.</p> <p>\"It's Nan's turn,\" said Angela.</p> <p>\"Then Mum's,\" said Nan, the Dyers being a democratic household.</p> <p>\"Can I make one, too?\" said Peter.</p> <p>Soon, Nan was up to her elbows in aubergine, courgette and garlic, while Angela filled the calzones as if she'd been doing it all her life. No sooner had one pizza been sent to the oven than it was time to start on the next, but no one minded, least of all Peter. An hour later, they'd made - and eaten - each of Rosie's creations twice over, yet there was still plenty of dough and toppings left over. \"Tell you what,\" said Rosie, \"why don't Peter and Nan devise their own?\"</p> <p>Talk about red rag to a bull. While Nan placed a pinch of this and a teaspoon of that on her base, Peter piled a glistening mound of sweated onion on a slab of dough, topped it with a great smear of pesto, then chucked on hummocks of potato, mozzarella and mushroom, before capping the lot with a storm of Parmesan. \"We've gone a bit excessive here,\" said Rosie as he presented his creation. Ten minutes later, a leaning tower of pizza emerged from the oven, but no one made a move towards it: two doughs, six toppings and 12 pizzas later, they could eat no more.</p> <p>All except Peter, that is. \"That means I get a big bit,\" he said. \"And Mum, can we have pizza for dinner?\"</p> <p>To get your pizza going at once, give it plenty of bottom heat: preheat a baking tray and place the prepared pizza on top.</p> <p><b> Plain pizza dough</b></p> <p>Makes six to eight pizzas.</p> <p><b> 20g fresh yeast</b></p> <p><b>500g strong white four</b></p> <p><b>15g salt</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp olive oil</b></p> <p><b>Around 350ml warm water</b></p> <p>Sift the dry ingredients into a large, warm bowl, and mix with your hands, distributing the yeast evenly. Add the oil, then slowly add water - it may or may not take all the water. You want a workable yet still-moist dough - if it's too moist, add a little more flour. Turn the dough on to a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with oiled clingfilm and leave in a warm place to prove and double in size. Knock it back a little with your fist, and it's ready for use.</p> <p><b> Enriched dough</b></p> <p>Makes six to eight pizzas.</p> <p><b> 15g fresh yeast</b></p> <p><b>2 tsp sugar</b></p> <p><b>35ml warm milk</b></p> <p><b>500g strong white flour</b></p> <p><b>60g softened butter</b></p> <p><b>2 eggs</b></p> <p><b>1 tsp salt</b></p> <p><b>35ml warm water</b></p> <p>Mix the yeast with the sugar until it dissolves, then add to the warm milk. Sift flour into a warm bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the butter, eggs, salt, water and yeast mixture. Bring together and knead to a smooth dough. Place in a clean bowl, cover with oiled clingfilm, and put in a warm place to prove and double in size (allow up to two hours). Knock back, and you're ready to go.</p> <p><b> Pissaladi\u00e8re</b></p> <p>Not really a pizza, I know, but this classic French tart topping is ideal with the rich dough. Serves three to four.</p> <p><b> 450g white onions, finely sliced</b></p> <p><b>200g red onions, finely sliced</b></p> <p><b>3 tbsp olive oil</b></p> <p><b>2 large red peppers</b></p> <p><b>1 handful pitted black olives</b></p> <p>In a covered pot, carefully sweat the onions in the oil. Stir from time to time, and remove the lid when they are nearly ready, to cook off any excess moisture - they should be pulpy and slightly sweet. When the onions are done, season and set aside. Hold the peppers over an open flame (use a skewer), char them all over, then put in a plastic bag to cool. Peel off the skins (they will come off easily), deseed and cut into strips.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 225C/425F/ gas mark 7. Lightly oil a Swiss-roll-sized baking tray, take half the enriched dough and shape into a rectangle. Roll out to fit the tray and no more than cm thick, and lay it on the baking tray.</p> <p>Spread with a thick layer of onion, leaving a 1cm border all around. Lay the pepper on top in a diagonal grid, and put an olive in each 'square' (classic pissaladi\u00e8re uses anchovies.) Place on a preheated baking sheet, and cook for 15-20 minutes, until the base is crisp.</p> <p><b> Spring vegetable and pesto pizza</b></p> <p>For the simple dough. Serves four. For the pesto</p> <p><b> 1 big bunch fresh basil, picked</b></p> <p><b>Five sprigs fresh mint, picked</b></p> <p><b>2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</b></p> <p><b>Olive oil</b></p> <p><b>125g fresh Parmesan, grated</b></p> <p>For the topping</p> <p><b> 1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed</b></p> <p><b>1 handful fresh peas, podded</b></p> <p><b>1 handful fresh broad beans, podded</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp pecorino, coarsely grated</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Make the pesto: blitz the garlic with seasoning and olive oil, add the herbs, whizz again, add Parmesan and season to taste. Blanch the veg until al dente, and slip off the bean skins.</p> <p>Take half the basic dough, split into four pieces and roll into rounds. Spread a layer of pesto on top of each, then over the vegetables. Sprinkle with pecorino, and season, remembering that the cheese is already pretty salty. Slide on to a preheated tray and bake until crisp, about 15-20 minutes.</p> <p><b> Roast aubergine, courgette and garlic pizza</b></p> <p>Also for the rich dough. Serves four.</p> <p><b> 1 whole head of garlic, unpeeled</b></p> <p><b>Salt and fresh-milled black pepper</b></p> <p><b>1 sprig fresh thyme</b></p> <p><b>Olive oil</b></p> <p><b>3 courgettes, sliced on a diagonal</b></p> <p><b>2 aubergines, cut into cm rings</b></p> <p><b>1 bunch fresh basil</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Toss the head of garlic in a little olive oil, salt and pepper, pop in a pan with the thyme and a large tablespoon of water, cover and roast for 40 minutes, until completely soft. Toss the courgettes and aubergines in oil, seasoning and torn basil, place in a single layer on an oven tray and bake for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Turn up the oven to 225C/425F/ gas mark 7. Take half the dough, split it into four and roll into rounds. Squeeze the softened garlic cloves out of their papery coats and spread over the bases. Sprinkle with basil, cover with alternate pieces of courgette and aubergine, season, drizzle with oil and place on a preheated baking tray. Bake until crisp, around 15-20 minutes.</p> <p><b> Leek, mushroom and new potato pizza</b></p> <p>Use either dough for this. Serves four.</p> <p><b> 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</b></p> <p><b>1 bunch parsley, picked and chopped</b></p> <p><b>55g butter, softened</b></p> <p><b>Olive oil</b></p> <p><b>450g leeks, washed and cut thin</b></p> <p><b>450g mushrooms (wild, cultivated or mixed)</b></p> <p><b>200g new potatoes, boiled</b></p> <p><b>200g goats' cheese</b></p> <p><b>Thyme</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 225C/425F/gas mark 7. First, mix the garlic, parsley and butter together, and set aside.</p> <p>Heat a little oil in a pan and saut\u00e9 the leeks until al dente. Clean the mushrooms with a damp cloth, slice and saut\u00e9 in a little oil. Towards the end of the frying, add a knob of garlic and parsley butter, and season. Cut the potatoes into slices as thick as a \u00a31 coin.</p> <p>Take half the dough, split into four and roll into rounds. Place leeks on top of each base, dot with garlic and parsley butter, and sprinkle with thyme. Scatter over the potato and mushrooms, then crumble the cheese over the top. Slide on to a preheated baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the base is crisp.</p> <p><b> Butternut squash, mozzeralla and romesco calzone</b></p> <p>For the rich dough. This Catalan sauce is usually served with grilled fish or veg, but is ideal pizza material. The quantities for the sauce will make more than you need, so you can try it the traditional way, too. Serves two. For the romesco sauce</p> <p><b> 25g almonds</b></p> <p><b>25g hazelnuts</b></p> <p><b>90ml olive oil</b></p> <p><b>1 chunk of stale white bread, crusts removed and cut into cubes</b></p> <p><b>2 cloves garlic, crushed</b></p> <p><b>200g tinned tomatoes, chopped</b></p> <p><b>1 fresh red chilli, finely chopped</b></p> <p><b>1 pinch cayenne</b></p> <p><b>Sea salt and black pepper</b></p> <p><b>1 tsp sugar</b></p> <p><b>2 tsp vinegar</b></p> <p><b>4 tbsp fino or manzanilla sherry</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Roast the nuts until lightly browned, then set aside to cool. Heat three tablespoons of oil in a pan, and saut\u00e9 the garlic and bread until golden. Remove from the pan, add two tablespoons of oil (the bread will have soaked up the first lot) and fry off the tomatoes, chilli, cayenne, salt, pepper and sugar.</p> <p>Turn up the oven to 225C/435F/ gas mark 7. Grind the nuts in a blender or pestle, add the bread and garlic, then gradually pour in the vinegar and sherry. Add this mixture to the tomato sauce when most of the tomato juice liquid has reduced. Reduce the liquid in the pan a little more and season.</p> <p>For the calzone</p> <p><b> 8 tbsp romesco sauce</b></p> <p><b>250g butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1cm thick pieces</b></p> <p><b>1 mozzarella (preferably buffalo)</b></p> <p><b>Olive oil</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Sprinkle some olive oil and seasoning over the squash, and pop it into the oven while it is heating up, which will make it less firm to the bite. Break the cheese into chunks.</p> <p>Roll out a third of the enriched dough into two rounds, and spread romesco sauce over one half of each, leaving a 2cm border at the edge.</p> <p>Top with a generous layer of squash followed by an ample one of mozzarella. Cover with more sauce, and finish with a final layer of squash. Fold over as above, and bake until golden and crisp.</p> <p><b> Broccoli, spinach and blue cheese calzone</b></p> <p> Serves four.</p> <p><b> 450g broccoli, trimmed</b></p> <p><b>450g spinach, washed</b></p> <p><b>225g roquefort or other blue cheese</b></p> <p><b>Olive oil</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp raisins</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp pinenuts</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Toast the pinenuts. Turn up the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Blanch the broccoli (stalks as well as florets) in boiling, salted water until al dente. Heat some oil in a pan, wilt the spinach for no more than two minutes, then squeeze between two plates to remove any excess moisture.</p> <p>Roll out half the dough into four largish circles. Leaving an edge of 2cm or so, layer half of each round with first spinach, then cheese, then broccoli, scattering the raisins and pinenuts as you go. Fold over the other half of the dough circle, thereby forming a half-moon shape, and press down the edges. Place on a preheated baking tray and bake until the dough is crisp and lightly golden, 15 minutes or so</p> <p>\u0095 Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Plain pizza dough Makes six to eight pizzas. 20g fresh yeast 500g strong white four 15g salt 2 tbsp olive oil Around 350ml warm water Sift the dry ingredients into a large, warm bowl, and mix with your hands, distributing the yeast evenly. Add the oil, then slowly add water - it may or may not take all the water. You want a workable yet still-moist dough - if it's too moist, add a little more flour. Turn the dough on to a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with oiled clingfilm and leave in a warm place to prove and double in size. Knock it back a little with your fist, and it's ready for use. Enriched dough Makes six to eight pizzas. 15g fresh yeast 2 tsp sugar 35ml warm milk 500g strong white flour 60g softened butter 2 eggs 1 tsp salt 35ml warm water Mix the yeast with the sugar until it dissolves, then add to the warm milk. Sift flour into a warm bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the butter, eggs, salt, water and yeast mixture. Bring together and knead to a smooth dough. Place in a clean bowl, cover with oiled clingfilm, and put in a warm place to prove and double in size (allow up to two hours). Knock back, and you're ready to go. Pissaladi\u00e8re Not really a pizza, I know, but this classic French tart topping is ideal with the rich dough. Serves three to four. 450g white onions, finely sliced 200g red onions, finely sliced 3 tbsp olive oil 2 large red peppers 1 handful pitted black olives In a covered pot, carefully sweat the onions in the oil. Stir from time to time, and remove the lid when they are nearly ready, to cook off any excess moisture - they should be pulpy and slightly sweet. When the onions are done, season and set aside. Hold the peppers over an open flame (use a skewer), char them all over, then put in a plastic bag to cool. Peel off the skins (they will come off easily), deseed and cut into strips. Preheat the oven to 225C/425F/ gas mark 7. Lightly oil a Swiss-roll-sized baking tray, take half the enriched dough and shape into a rectangle. Roll out to fit the tray and no more than cm thick, and lay it on the baking tray. Spread with a thick layer of onion, leaving a 1cm border all around. Lay the pepper on top in a diagonal grid, and put an olive in each 'square' (classic pissaladi\u00e8re uses anchovies.) Place on a preheated baking sheet, and cook for 15-20 minutes, until the base is crisp. Spring vegetable and pesto pizza For the simple dough. Serves four. For the pesto 1 big bunch fresh basil, picked Five sprigs fresh mint, picked 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed Olive oil 125g fresh Parmesan, grated For the topping 1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed 1 handful fresh peas, podded 1 handful fresh broad beans, podded 1 tbsp pecorino, coarsely grated Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.

Serves four. 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed 1 bunch parsley, picked and chopped 55g butter, softened Olive oil 450g leeks, washed and cut thin 450g mushrooms (wild, cultivated or mixed) 200g new potatoes, boiled 200g goats' cheese Thyme Preheat the oven to 225C/425F/gas mark 7. First, mix the garlic, parsley and butter together, and set aside. Heat a little oil in a pan and saut\u00e9 the leeks until al dente. Clean the mushrooms with a damp cloth, slice and saut\u00e9 in a little oil. Towards the end of the frying, add a knob of garlic and parsley butter, and season. Cut the potatoes into slices as thick as a \u00a31 coin. Take half the dough, split into four and roll into rounds. Place leeks on top of each base, dot with garlic and parsley butter, and sprinkle with thyme. Scatter over the potato and mushrooms, then crumble the cheese over the top. Slide on to a preheated baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the base is crisp. Butternut squash, mozzeralla and romesco calzone For the rich dough. This Catalan sauce is usually served with grilled fish or veg, but is ideal pizza material. The quantities for the sauce will make more than you need, so you can try it the traditional way, too. Serves two. For the romesco sauce 25g almonds 25g hazelnuts 90ml olive oil 1 chunk of stale white bread, crusts removed and cut into cubes 2 cloves garlic, crushed 200g tinned tomatoes, chopped 1 fresh red chilli, finely chopped 1 pinch cayenne Sea salt and black pepper 1 tsp sugar 2 tsp vinegar 4 tbsp fino or manzanilla sherry Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Roast the nuts until lightly browned, then set aside to cool. Heat three tablespoons of oil in a pan, and saut\u00e9 the garlic and bread until golden. Remove from the pan, add two tablespoons of oil (the bread will have soaked up the first lot) and fry off the tomatoes, chilli, cayenne, salt, pepper and sugar. Turn up the oven to 225C/435F/ gas mark 7. Grind the nuts in a blender or pestle, add the bread and garlic, then gradually pour in the vinegar and sherry. Add this mixture to the tomato sauce when most of the tomato juice liquid has reduced. Reduce the liquid in the pan a little more and season. For the calzone 8 tbsp romesco sauce 250g butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1cm thick pieces 1 mozzarella (preferably buffalo) Olive oil Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Sprinkle some olive oil and seasoning over the squash, and pop it into the oven while it is heating up, which will make it less firm to the bite. Break the cheese into chunks. Roll out a third of the enriched dough into two rounds, and spread romesco sauce over one half of each, leaving a 2cm border at the edge. Top with a generous layer of squash followed by an ample one of mozzarella. Cover with more sauce, and finish with a final layer of squash. Fold over as above, and bake until golden and crisp. Broccoli, spinach and blue cheese calzone Serves four. 450g broccoli, trimmed 450g spinach, washed 225g roquefort or other blue cheese Olive oil 2 tbsp raisins 2 tbsp pinenuts Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Toast the pinenuts. Turn up the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Blanch the broccoli (stalks as well as florets) in boiling, salted water until al dente. Heat some oil in a pan, wilt the spinach for no more than two minutes, then squeeze between two plates to remove any excess moisture. Roll out half the dough into four largish circles. Leaving an edge of 2cm or so, layer half of each round with first spinach, then cheese, then broccoli, scattering the raisins and pinenuts as you go. Fold over the other half of the dough circle, thereby forming a half-moon shape, and press down the edges. Place on a preheated baking tray and bake until the dough is crisp and lightly golden, 15 minutes or so \u0095 Do you have a culinary dilemma?

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It seems peculiar, looking back now, to recall that my first impression of Susan Sontag was distinctly antipathetic, even hostile. Now I have come to think of her as one of the warmest, funniest, most generous and silliest people I have ever met - silly in the sense of playful, spontaneous, alive. But that first day in Prague, at the literary festival, listening to her talk - effusively and not always interestingly; watching her interact with the other writers - bossily, even selfishly hogging the limelight; observing her deal with the audience - peremptory at times to the point of insult. </p> <p>One young man's question, convoluted but nonetheless heartfelt, dismissed as \"making no sense\". A young Czech woman, whose request for an autograph for her album was greeted with, \"I don't do that. I only sign books.\" Sontag herself, remonstrating about being introduced on the platform as an intellectual, as in \"one of America's leading intellectuals\" - using the mantle of authority her fame has given her to repudiate that authority - though you'd think after almost 40 years she must be used to it by now. </p> <p>Indeed, the most quoted line about Sontag is Jonathan Miller's \"probably the most intelligent woman in America\". Anyway, the immediate impression was of someone haughty, humourless, disregarding of others' feelings and self-regarding to the verge of narcissism. Wrong. Though on the narcissism front there may be something small to answer. </p> <p>Every time you meet someone, you have to ask yourself, Is it the person I am meeting or the part that they are playing? With Sontag, I think I met both. The role, \"the intellectual\" is extant - there in the essays: Against Interpretation, Styles Of Radical Will, On Photography. In her monographs - on, among others, Godard, Barthes, Simone Weil - leading intellectual and cultural figures of the 20th century. \"Concealing myself behind my admiration,\" she says now, though borrowing a voice might be closer. </p> <p>But since Sontag herself now repudiates the part - \"I think I had some moralistic idea about enlightenment and elevating people. Where there was darkness then there was light, that kind of thing. Or maybe it was the only thing I knew how to do,\" - I am not going to deal with it overmuch. She has changed, she says: \"Change is my speciality.\" Though you could equally say that what she has done is to go back, to find the person she would have been, before life, experience intervened. </p> <p>Hannah Arendt, the German Jewish political theorist and philosopher, and herself a writer of some wonderful monographs - on friends such as the poet Randall Jarrell, on writers she admired such as Isak Dinesen - used to refer to what she called \"the specifically human quality of greatness\", which she defined in this way: \"True greatness, even in works of art . . . appears only where we sense behind... a being that remains greater and more mysterious because the work itself points to a person whose essence can be neither exhausted nor fully revealed by whatever he may have the power to do.\" This desire to \"sense behind\", to delight in the greatness of a person, to accept that you can't know it all, to refuse to view the person as the work, Arendt sometimes summed up in the word \"friendship\". </p> <p>It's not an easy quality to come by, this friendship, it requires a certain openness of character, an intrepidity of spirit. You read Sontag's early work, and it lies flat and lifeless on the page. Insightful, analytically intelligent it may be. But there is no friendship in it. She knows it, and it makes her sad, or anyway rueful. \"What did I think I was doing?\" But the past 10 years she has begun writing fiction, or rather returned to fiction - her first book, The Benefactor, was a novel. In this 10 years, she has written two books: The Volcano Lover, published in 1992, based on the triangular relationship between Emma Hamilton, her husband William Hamilton and her lover, Lord Nelson, which became a worldwide best seller; and her latest novel, In America, again based on a true story, that of the actress Maryna Zalewska who, in 1876, emigrated from Poland to California to set up a commune and later wowed America as a performer. </p> <p>Fiction has released her, Sontag says. \"I am so much freer. I can write more expansively, more expressively. It's like the doors have been flung open and there's a view.\" She says she doesn't understand how it happened, it's a mystery, she just regrets that it didn't happen sooner. \"I know you shouldn't regret things. But it's a bit like having only one child. I would have loved more and I regret that. I can't help it.\" </p> <p>She talks now frankly and unguardedly, and she laughs, all the time, like someone who has just discovered laughter. When she gets excited, her voice rises and rises so that sentences end almost in song. It's very funny and engaging. She loves being teased, she's a great flirt and quite a flatterer. She is also surprising. We were talking at one point about transformation, about inventing a self. Listen, she said, \"I have this to say about self-invention. If I use those words it's because I have had to produce a kind of language of what I do. I don't start with those words, I'd be crazy. If you want to know what it feels like to be me, it is someone mooching along trying to work out how to make a sentence that's not ugly.\" </p> <p>And, if I hadn't liked her so much already, at what she said next I would have thrown myself at her feet. \"If I hadn't allowed my insufferable moralism to kidnap me, if I'd stuck with fiction . . . \" But she couldn't resist the attention. \"The essays got so much attention.\" It's no wonder she mistrusts the media. Has a love-hate relationship with attention. The media gave her an image, as a sort of pr t-\u00e0-porter cultural guru, and she became fixed in it. But she was complicit with it, you say. Well, yes and no. She was young, as she says, naive. She didn't see until too late what was being made of her. </p> <p>It's hard to think back to the early 60s, to that eager early feminism, how desperate we all were for a female face. Face being the operative word. Sontag was, and remains, at 67, a beauty. \"Yes, I always knew it. I was pretty and smart, and that drew attention to me. But what I've always felt is that I didn't ask either for these prejudices or for those benefits.\" </p> <p>And what happened, I suspect, is that as the gap between how she saw herself (intelligent, but nonetheless a moocher) and how she was seen (\"a tastemaker, a producer of opinions\") widened, she began to perceive herself as a fraud. Or anyway to feel fraudulent. And that's a huge weight to carry. The mystery, then, is not how she released herself, but that she was able to do it at all. What she is saying, of course, is that the non-fiction, the essays, were in fact a fiction. And the fiction, the novels, are real. But it takes immense courage to pull away the mask. To insist that you are seen in friendship, or not at all. </p> <p>She sets her novels in the past, in history. \"Because the past is a way of looking at the present, though I am moving slowly towards the 21st century. My next novel will be set in 30s Japan.\" Her instinct is probably right - to start from a distance and work gradually forward. She tells me that the first time she ever talked about her own past, her \"personal life\", was when she was being interviewed in 1992 for The Volcano Lover. Prior to this, she'd always held tenaciously to TS Eliot's line that great writing is impersonal. \"That biography is trivia.\" It was her lifeline. </p> <p>\"I remember that time saying that my mother had been an alcoholic.\" Her mother had died six years earlier, in 1986, from lung cancer. \"And after, I rang my sister Judith and said, 'I've just thrown mother to the wolves.' And Judith said, 'Good.'\" It's strange. So much rage, and yet in life she said nothing to her mother at all. Even on her death-bed, in hospital in Hawaii, where her mother lived, Sontag was unable to put out her hand to her. \"She was the sort of woman who flinched if you touched her.\" Her mother's last words to her were, \"Why don't you go back to the hotel?\" To which Susan replied, \"Oh, you know, mother, I love hospitals.\" And her mother smiled and closed her eyes. \"She liked that, you see. She thought it witty and sarcastic. I couldn't say, 'I've come here because I love you. I've come because you are mortally ill.'\" </p> <p>Of course she couldn't. Not after a lifetime of not saying. Imagine the depth of sadness, of waste, that could reveal. \"I adored her,\" Susan says, \"but in that way you adore someone you can't have. I hardly saw her as a child. She was always away.\" And the father? Absent also. A wealthy furrier, living and working in China, in the British concession in Tiensin, he died from tuberculosis, in 1939, when Susan was five. The two children were brought up by nannies and servants in the big house on Long Island, where they lived. So she hardly knew him. \"Though I cried for him every day of my childhood.\" </p> <p>Her mother lied to her. Lied about his death, said he was coming home. Lied later about the cause of his death, said he died from pneumonia. \"There was a stigma at that time surrounding TB.\" Lied even about where he was buried. \"Said it was Brooklyn, when in fact it was Queens.\" </p> <p>Just two years ago she employed a researcher to track down his grave and went to visit it. And suddenly there was his headstone: Jack Rosenblatt. \"There's knowing and really knowing. I don't think I had believed he was dead until then.\" </p> <p>Susan was 12 when she changed her name from Rosenblatt to Sontag. Her mother had remarried, \"A foolish man, a war hero, a harmless, inept, fatuous guy.\" They skipped off to Mexico, got wed, and didn't tell the girls until their return. He never legally adopted them. So he was never their father. But he was there, a present figure of authority, substituting for an absent figure of authority, and, as you can see from her description of him, she despised him. </p> <p>So what do you do as a bright young girl who, in her early teens, finds herself in the wrong place, and misunderstood. Because how could this fatuous, inept guy ever understand her? Or, indeed, her mother - the \"cold, cruel woman\" she describes. I think two things happen. You grow up early, too early. You bypass adolescence - though you'll probably have to make a detour back there later. And you find yourself a new authority. An authority that challenges the ineptitude of this poor substitute. </p> <p> She found it in academia. She says herself that books became her refuge. That she'd spend her evenings in the library, away from home. Comforting herself with knowledge, learning things by rote - she has always had a prodigious memory, as well as a prodigious curiosity. Learning became her unassailable identity. Or so she thought. And the irony is that it could have worked. If she had been less clever, less curious, more easily satisfied. </p> <p>Probably it did work for a while. She told me that she'd never understood why her sister rejected learning - never did well at school. \"I always thought that I had made a really good choice. I couldn't see why Judith didn't make it, too. She was an under-achiever, bright but anti-ambitious.\" She couldn't see it because her own need was blocking her view. She became \"an intellectual\" - let's give it that name - out of insecurity, out of need. Judith, presumably, had other needs. </p> <p>Why did she take her mother's husband's name? More to the point, why did she keep it? I asked her, and she said this: \"I think I liked Sontag. It sounded less funny, less Jewish, than Rosenblatt. More American.\" And, in post-war America, anti-Semitism was again rife. Germany was being resurrected as an ally. \"I was used, at school, to being called a dirty kike. I think I was relieved to change my name.\" </p> <p>It's an answer but it may not be enough. She felt betrayed by her father, she says. \"He didn't come back.\" Changing her name was not a reciprocal betrayal. It was something else. A constant reminder. As if keeping a name that wasn't real pointed always to the reality behind it. That whoever she may have been was obliterated. She was 16 when she left home. Why did she marry at 17? And a man, Philip Reiff, whom she scarcely knew. Reiff, 10 years older than she, was an academic at Chicago University, where she was studying. He met her one day, took her out for dinner, a cheeseburger, took her out the next day for breakfast, and then for lunch, another cheeseburger. And that evening he proposed. He told her that the moment he heard her voice he knew she was the woman he was going to marry. </p> <p>\"I'd never been called a woman before. I thought it was fantastic. I said yes. Isn't that crazy?\" When she suggested they should sleep together, he said, we'll marry first. \"I thought, 'He's even purer than I am.' We were married the next week.\" </p> <p>Of course she left him. Nine years later, when their son David was seven. She left him, she says, to become another person. \"I had longings. I didn't know what they were, but they weren't to be in the academic world.\" This must be right. She was bored. \"I felt as if all the oxygen was going out of me.\" In her new book, In America, in the first chapter, Chapter Zero, written in the person of the narrator, she describes how, at 18, she read Middlemarch. \". . . And a third of the way through the book I burst into tears because I realised that not only was I Dorothea but that, a few months earlier, I had married Mr Casubon.\" Casubon being the representation of all that is dull and stale about academia. </p> <p>She writes, also in this chapter, about her main character, the actress Maryna, \". . . she would never be seduced into forgetting herself\". It's an interesting word here, seduction. Success, fame, applause, attention came to Sontag like a lover, and she couldn't resist it. I asked her if she had loved her husband. \"Oh yes,\" she said, she loved him, it was a real marriage. And I asked her if he had loved her. \"I can't say that,\" she replied. \"I can't say that someone loved me. No. I just can't.\" As though being loved, allowing yourself to be beloved, becomes another form of forgetting. </p> <p>So began her impersonation on the public stage. In private, of course, she'd been doing it since she was 12. Putting on what she calls \"her essay voice\". She kept herself at a distance from what she wrote, forgot herself, as she says. Loved the work, but didn't expect much back. \"I think very early on I developed a way of dealing with painful information, which was to say, that's interesting. Instead of allowing myself to be hurt by it.\" </p> <p>So she went through the world kind of inured by her interest in things. Things because it was not the person, it was always the work. And says she was surprised that the world seemed to confuse her with what she was writing about - all these male authority figures such as Barthes and Godard, et al. And also loved it. \"You know, like the child who wants the attention and then is embarrassed by it.\" But didn't trust it. \"Always felt the applause is simply that they've never seen anything better. So it was meaningless. They just didn't have the imagination to imagine anything else.\" </p> <p> Small wonder she is fascinated by actors. Their psychology. \"The debate about whether an actor feels what he or she is incarnating, the sincerity of the actor, is a real debate, don't you think? I've always been moved by the anxiety of actors.\" And: \"I think it's a sign of professionalism to be afraid.\" It is also an instinct for survival to be afraid. Though first you have to identify the danger. </p> <p>Both her recent novels, The Volcano Lover and In America, focus on strong, fearless women who strike poses. Emma Hamilton, whose husband used to display her in Greek \"attitudes\", like a living sculpture and who dies a penniless victim. And Maryna, the professional actress who doesn't die, who becomes a star, one of the dubious rewards that America can endow, and so traduces her talent. A different sort of death. I think we assume that in both cases the audience that matters is male. That both are women who function to please men and who, one way or the other, get lost. There's a line in The Volcano Lover: \". . . emotional women who don't have power, real power, usually end up being victims.\" How not to be a victim, of your success, viz Maryna, of your beauty, viz Emma. Of yourself and your own story, viz Sontag, has become Sontag's embracing subject. </p> <p>There's no answer, or rather there's a whole panoply of answers - one of which may be to free yourself from the trap of others' expectations. Sacrifice your audience, or find a new, sympathetic audience. Maybe this becomes easier as you get older, I say, there's less above you to weigh down on you, the spectre of authority becomes lighter. </p> <p> S hall I tell you about getting older, she says, and she is laughing. \"When you get older, 45 plus, men stop fancying you. Or put it another way, the men I fancy don't fancy me. I want a young man. I love beauty. So what's new?\" She says she has been in love seven times in her life, which seems quite a lot. \"No, hang on,\" she says. \"Actually, it's nine. Five women, four men.\" </p> <p>She will talk about her bisexuality quite openly now. It's simple, she says. \"As I've become less attractive to men, so I've found myself more with women. It's what happens. Ask any woman my age. More women come on to you than men. And women are fantastic. Around 40, women blossom. Women are a work-in-progress. Men burn out.\" She doesn't have a lover now, she lives alone. The rumours about her and the photographer Annie Leibovitz are, she says, without foundation. They are close friends. </p> <p>Maybe it sounds foolish, she says. \"Maybe everyone will think I have an aberrant life, or a low sex drive. Maybe I am consigning myself to the asexual here. But speaking candidly, and only for myself, there are so many things in my life now that are more important to me than my sexuality. My relationship with my son, David. My writing. Even my moral passions seem to me to be far more defining than my erotic life. People can conclude from this what they want.\" </p> <p>She talks with this same clarity about cancer, from which she has suffered twice. Metastatic breast cancer in 1976. Uterine cancer in 1998. It was after she had breast cancer that she wrote her book, Illness As Metaphor. \"To try to help dispel the stigma of that disease. To demystify illness. In the 70s, people still referred to it as the Big C. They were superstitious even about naming it.\" But, as she says, the origins of that book lay with her father's death. He had the disease that was stigmatised in the 40s, a disease so shaming that her mother had to lie to her about it. Maybe that's where knowledge begins, with the refutation of a lie. </p> <p>She doesn't think of illness as imparting knowledge, she says. She thinks of illness as illness, requiring treatment. In her case, with the breast cancer, a mastectomy followed by three years of chemotherapy. And with the uterine cancer, a total hysterectomy. And what the experience has left her with, she says, is a dual feeling. \"That I may soon be dead. And simultaneously, an elation that I am not.\" </p> <p>Her life, she says, has been a progress from austerity to something more expressive. \"You know I used to want to be Simone Weil, die on an ant-hill, sacrifice myself.\" She used to throw herself at these ideals, she says. \"I've always been a great faller-in-love. A great adorer. Bigger than any talent I have, bigger than whatever courage I have, is this desire I have to admire.\" It's not like so many other desires, it doesn't tame with age. But she has found a way of tethering it. \"Writing fiction seems to me a way of being in the world, of paying attention to the world, without imprisoning yourself in yourself.\" Or, she could add, in anyone else's notion of who you may be. </p> <p>I can't say she is fearless - she must have her terrors, like everyone else - but she is brave. She has in abundance two qualities, courage and conscience. No false gods now. My abiding image of her will be of her running down the street, in pain, because the chemotherapy has left her with nerve damage to her legs so bad that some days she can hardly bear to walk. But oblivious. And laughing because it's funny and she is having fun. And shouting. \"We are friends.\" </p> <p>Friendship, as Arendt said. The desire to delight in other people.

      "bodyText": "It seems peculiar, looking back now, to recall that my first impression of Susan Sontag was distinctly antipathetic, even hostile. Now I have come to think of her as one of the warmest, funniest, most generous and silliest people I have ever met - silly in the sense of playful, spontaneous, alive. But that first day in Prague, at the literary festival, listening to her talk - effusively and not always interestingly; watching her interact with the other writers - bossily, even selfishly hogging the limelight; observing her deal with the audience - peremptory at times to the point of insult. One young man's question, convoluted but nonetheless heartfelt, dismissed as \"making no sense\". A young Czech woman, whose request for an autograph for her album was greeted with, \"I don't do that. I only sign books.\" Sontag herself, remonstrating about being introduced on the platform as an intellectual, as in \"one of America's leading intellectuals\" - using the mantle of authority her fame has given her to repudiate that authority - though you'd think after almost 40 years she must be used to it by now. Indeed, the most quoted line about Sontag is Jonathan Miller's \"probably the most intelligent woman in America\". Anyway, the immediate impression was of someone haughty, humourless, disregarding of others' feelings and self-regarding to the verge of narcissism. Wrong. Though on the narcissism front there may be something small to answer. Every time you meet someone, you have to ask yourself, Is it the person I am meeting or the part that they are playing? With Sontag, I think I met both. The role, \"the intellectual\" is extant - there in the essays: Against Interpretation, Styles Of Radical Will, On Photography. In her monographs - on, among others, Godard, Barthes, Simone Weil - leading intellectual and cultural figures of the 20th century. \"Concealing myself behind my admiration,\" she says now, though borrowing a voice might be closer. But since Sontag herself now repudiates the part - \"I think I had some moralistic idea about enlightenment and elevating people. Where there was darkness then there was light, that kind of thing. Or maybe it was the only thing I knew how to do,\" - I am not going to deal with it overmuch. She has changed, she says: \"Change is my speciality.\" Though you could equally say that what she has done is to go back, to find the person she would have been, before life, experience intervened. Hannah Arendt, the German Jewish political theorist and philosopher, and herself a writer of some wonderful monographs - on friends such as the poet Randall Jarrell, on writers she admired such as Isak Dinesen - used to refer to what she called \"the specifically human quality of greatness\", which she defined in this way: \"True greatness, even in works of art . . . appears only where we sense behind... a being that remains greater and more mysterious because the work itself points to a person whose essence can be neither exhausted nor fully revealed by whatever he may have the power to do.\" This desire to \"sense behind\", to delight in the greatness of a person, to accept that you can't know it all, to refuse to view the person as the work, Arendt sometimes summed up in the word \"friendship\". It's not an easy quality to come by, this friendship, it requires a certain openness of character, an intrepidity of spirit. You read Sontag's early work, and it lies flat and lifeless on the page. Insightful, analytically intelligent it may be. But there is no friendship in it. She knows it, and it makes her sad, or anyway rueful. \"What did I think I was doing?\" But the past 10 years she has begun writing fiction, or rather returned to fiction - her first book, The Benefactor, was a novel. In this 10 years, she has written two books: The Volcano Lover, published in 1992, based on the triangular relationship between Emma Hamilton, her husband William Hamilton and her lover, Lord Nelson, which became a worldwide best seller; and her latest novel, In America, again based on a true story, that of the actress Maryna Zalewska who, in 1876, emigrated from Poland to California to set up a commune and later wowed America as a performer. Fiction has released her, Sontag says. \"I am so much freer. I can write more expansively, more expressively. It's like the doors have been flung open and there's a view.\" She says she doesn't understand how it happened, it's a mystery, she just regrets that it didn't happen sooner. \"I know you shouldn't regret things. But it's a bit like having only one child. I would have loved more and I regret that. I can't help it.\" She talks now frankly and unguardedly, and she laughs, all the time, like someone who has just discovered laughter. When she gets excited, her voice rises and rises so that sentences end almost in song. It's very funny and engaging. She loves being teased, she's a great flirt and quite a flatterer. She is also surprising. We were talking at one point about transformation, about inventing a self. Listen, she said, \"I have this to say about self-invention. If I use those words it's because I have had to produce a kind of language of what I do. I don't start with those words, I'd be crazy. If you want to know what it feels like to be me, it is someone mooching along trying to work out how to make a sentence that's not ugly.\" And, if I hadn't liked her so much already, at what she said next I would have thrown myself at her feet. \"If I hadn't allowed my insufferable moralism to kidnap me, if I'd stuck with fiction . . . \" But she couldn't resist the attention. \"The essays got so much attention.\" It's no wonder she mistrusts the media. Has a love-hate relationship with attention. The media gave her an image, as a sort of pr t-\u00e0-porter cultural guru, and she became fixed in it. But she was complicit with it, you say.

In private, of course, she'd been doing it since she was 12. Putting on what she calls \"her essay voice\". She kept herself at a distance from what she wrote, forgot herself, as she says. Loved the work, but didn't expect much back. \"I think very early on I developed a way of dealing with painful information, which was to say, that's interesting. Instead of allowing myself to be hurt by it.\" So she went through the world kind of inured by her interest in things. Things because it was not the person, it was always the work. And says she was surprised that the world seemed to confuse her with what she was writing about - all these male authority figures such as Barthes and Godard, et al. And also loved it. \"You know, like the child who wants the attention and then is embarrassed by it.\" But didn't trust it. \"Always felt the applause is simply that they've never seen anything better. So it was meaningless. They just didn't have the imagination to imagine anything else.\" Small wonder she is fascinated by actors. Their psychology. \"The debate about whether an actor feels what he or she is incarnating, the sincerity of the actor, is a real debate, don't you think? I've always been moved by the anxiety of actors.\" And: \"I think it's a sign of professionalism to be afraid.\" It is also an instinct for survival to be afraid. Though first you have to identify the danger. Both her recent novels, The Volcano Lover and In America, focus on strong, fearless women who strike poses. Emma Hamilton, whose husband used to display her in Greek \"attitudes\", like a living sculpture and who dies a penniless victim. And Maryna, the professional actress who doesn't die, who becomes a star, one of the dubious rewards that America can endow, and so traduces her talent. A different sort of death. I think we assume that in both cases the audience that matters is male. That both are women who function to please men and who, one way or the other, get lost. There's a line in The Volcano Lover: \". . . emotional women who don't have power, real power, usually end up being victims.\" How not to be a victim, of your success, viz Maryna, of your beauty, viz Emma. Of yourself and your own story, viz Sontag, has become Sontag's embracing subject. There's no answer, or rather there's a whole panoply of answers - one of which may be to free yourself from the trap of others' expectations. Sacrifice your audience, or find a new, sympathetic audience. Maybe this becomes easier as you get older, I say, there's less above you to weigh down on you, the spectre of authority becomes lighter. S hall I tell you about getting older, she says, and she is laughing. \"When you get older, 45 plus, men stop fancying you. Or put it another way, the men I fancy don't fancy me. I want a young man. I love beauty. So what's new?\" She says she has been in love seven times in her life, which seems quite a lot. \"No, hang on,\" she says. \"Actually, it's nine. Five women, four men.\" She will talk about her bisexuality quite openly now. It's simple, she says. \"As I've become less attractive to men, so I've found myself more with women. It's what happens. Ask any woman my age. More women come on to you than men. And women are fantastic. Around 40, women blossom. Women are a work-in-progress. Men burn out.\" She doesn't have a lover now, she lives alone. The rumours about her and the photographer Annie Leibovitz are, she says, without foundation. They are close friends. Maybe it sounds foolish, she says. \"Maybe everyone will think I have an aberrant life, or a low sex drive. Maybe I am consigning myself to the asexual here. But speaking candidly, and only for myself, there are so many things in my life now that are more important to me than my sexuality. My relationship with my son, David. My writing. Even my moral passions seem to me to be far more defining than my erotic life. People can conclude from this what they want.\" She talks with this same clarity about cancer, from which she has suffered twice. Metastatic breast cancer in 1976. Uterine cancer in 1998. It was after she had breast cancer that she wrote her book, Illness As Metaphor. \"To try to help dispel the stigma of that disease. To demystify illness. In the 70s, people still referred to it as the Big C. They were superstitious even about naming it.\" But, as she says, the origins of that book lay with her father's death. He had the disease that was stigmatised in the 40s, a disease so shaming that her mother had to lie to her about it. Maybe that's where knowledge begins, with the refutation of a lie. She doesn't think of illness as imparting knowledge, she says. She thinks of illness as illness, requiring treatment. In her case, with the breast cancer, a mastectomy followed by three years of chemotherapy. And with the uterine cancer, a total hysterectomy. And what the experience has left her with, she says, is a dual feeling. \"That I may soon be dead. And simultaneously, an elation that I am not.\" Her life, she says, has been a progress from austerity to something more expressive. \"You know I used to want to be Simone Weil, die on an ant-hill, sacrifice myself.\" She used to throw herself at these ideals, she says. \"I've always been a great faller-in-love. A great adorer. Bigger than any talent I have, bigger than whatever courage I have, is this desire I have to admire.\" It's not like so many other desires, it doesn't tame with age. But she has found a way of tethering it. \"Writing fiction seems to me a way of being in the world, of paying attention to the world, without imprisoning yourself in yourself.\" Or, she could add, in anyone else's notion of who you may be. I can't say she is fearless - she must have her terrors, like everyone else - but she is brave. She has in abundance two qualities, courage and conscience. No false gods now. My abiding image of her will be of her running down the street, in pain, because the chemotherapy has left her with nerve damage to her legs so bad that some days she can hardly bear to walk. But oblivious. And laughing because it's funny and she is having fun. And shouting. \"We are friends.\" Friendship, as Arendt said. The desire to delight in other people.

Author Bob Rosner has two pieces of advice: distribute the agenda at least a day in advance and have a plan to handle difficult people. \"Comics have hecklers, companies have hoggers,\" he says. \"Be kind, but firm in keeping a few people from dominating the discussion. Reach out to people who are quiet so that everyone gets a chance to contribute. Monitor tension in the room. It's tough enough for most of us to juggle the agenda and the clock without having to worry about how people are feeling. But it's important. Try to be aware of body language. If you notice the tension level rising or if people are drifting away, bring it to the group's attention.\"",

To help you choose, Rise road-tested three different models in the current range of services. </p> <p><strong> A. Going back to university</strong> </p> <p>Your old university is a good place to start if you are still living nearby. But through the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services' (AGCAS) mutual aid agreement, you can actually walk into most university careers services and receive help. So, for example while I could have gone back to Humberside University, I saved myself the train fare and opted instead for City University, round the corner from where I work. </p> <p>There were plenty of resources on offer - staff were helpful and friendly and pointed me in the direction of PCs which I could use to write my CV (and print it out for a small fee) and analyse the career options open to me. There was a huge selection of books, leaflets and brochures on career planning in the library - and much of the infor-mation was free for me to take away. </p> <p>The university also offers one-to-one career guidance, although this needs to be arranged in advance. In City's case, this service is available only to people who graduated no more than two years ago, but this rule doesn't apply at all universities. These consultations are free at City, but some universities will make you pay if you are already in a job. </p> <p>If you can't get to a university campus, AGCAS also runs a graduate career phone line which is staffed by experienced university careers advisers. They can help you create a job-search strategy, evaluate the pros and cons of postgraduate study and discuss other issues where face-to-face contact is not essential. You pay for your call, but the advice itself is free. </p> <p><strong> B. Going private</strong> </p> <p>You can, of course, pay for advice if you want to. For example, I tested C2 - the Graduate Career Shop - which is part-funded by the Department for Education and Employment. It is aimed at graduates of all ages who want advice on a career change, CV analysis, creative job searching and interview techniques. </p> <p>C2 offers group sessions as well as personal consultations in most of these areas. One-to-ones are more expensive, so I opted for a group session about changing direction. After introducing ourselves, we found that we were facing a variety of career dilemmas which ranged from boredom to cravings for more money or fresh challenges. </p> <p>During the session we looked at why we wanted to change career, how to find a path which suited us, and then how to go about it. The workshop was thorough - it gave us plenty of ideas on how to assess our current situations in a realistic manner, order our priorities and take control of our careers. The session was interactive and we were free to suggest ideas or ask questions at any time. </p> <p>A group session costs \u00a315 for 90 minutes (or you can buy four for \u00a355). However, a follow-up 30-minute private consultation costs \u00a340, while a one-hour chat will set you back \u00a370. Yet personal consultations are popular and you may have to book two or three weeks ahead - not very helpful if you require urgent advice. </p> <p>However, you can visit C2's library of books and software for a charge of \u00a34 a day. </p> <p>C2 also offers psychometric testing. The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), for example will help you identify your personality type. This will enable you to understand your preferred way of working - essential when choosing a career that fits. </p> <p>The one-hour MBTI test costs \u00a380 at C2 but it is also available at other university career libraries and can cost as little as \u00a36 per session, a fiver of which is a deposit - if you turn up for the session you get your money back. </p> <p><strong> C. Going online</strong> </p> <p>If you're too lazy to leave the house, there is an increasing number of websites which offer general career advice, and I tested one of the best-known, ProspectsWeb which is run by the Higher Education Central Services Unit. </p> <p>The site gives masses of contact information on occupations, employers, postgraduate education, job vacancies and career libraries. Its Quick Match gets you thinking about the most important things you want from work and then matches these with the characteristics of different jobs. </p> <p>Prospects Direct, meanwhile will email you information on relevant job vacancies and opportunities.

      "body": "<p><strong> Norwegian Wood</strong> <br>Haruki Murakami, translated by Jay Rubin <br>Harvill, \u00a315, 594pp<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502424302,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> </p> <p><strong> Underground</strong> <br>Haruki Murakami, translated by Alfred Birnbaum and Philip Gabriel <br>Harvill, \u00a320, 309pp</p> <p>The men who narrate Haruki Murakami's novels repeatedly claim to be utterly ordinary. They live blameless lives, keep their heads down, indulge moderately in jazz and beer, hope things will stay the same. And yet something happens: the ordinary man is catapulted into deranged circumstances. He might be forced to hunt down an evil sheep that wants to take over the world, or to investigate his wife's spectral disappearance. </p> <p> Norwegian Wood, first published in Japan 13 years ago but only now translated for a western audience, might therefore puzzle the reader who has grown to love Murakami's haunting, melancholy surrealism: its action is resolutely realistic. And yet the narrator, Toru Watanabe, is just as baffled by life. At one point he writes: \"I have never lied to anyone, and I have taken care over the years not to hurt other people. And yet I find myself tossed into this labyrinth.\" There is no moral justice in Murakami's world; there is only the duty - both epistemological and moral - to try to understand. </p> <p>This duty also informs his first non-fiction volume, Underground. Murakami became obsessed with the 1995 Tokyo subway attack, in which Aum cult members released Sarin nerve gas on five separate trains. The book consists largely of edited transcripts of interviews conducted with survivors or relatives of victims. \"How on earth did this happen to us?\" one woman asks. \"That 'How on earth...?' \", Murakami comments, \"stuck in my head like a big question mark.\" No wonder: it is also the cry of pain that fires the depths of his fiction. </p> <p>Norwegian Wood is a love story. The Beatles song of the title, heard by the 37-year-old Toru Watanabe, is an aural Proustian madeleine that transports him back to his student days. Watanabe has started at university in Tokyo the year after his best friend, Kizuki, killed himself. Kizuki's girlfriend Naoko and Watanabe have grown romantically close since their friend's death, but their love is complicated by Naoko's depression. Naoko enrols at a sanatorium, and the lonely Watanabe meets another woman, the flirtatiously vulnerable Midori. Thus is his \"labyrinth\" woven: a choice between idealised love and eternally sworn loyalty or flesh-and-blood happiness in the present. </p> <p>The first chapter dreamily foreshadows the entire novel. Watanabe and Naoko, in the saturated colours and hyperreal detail of burned-in memory, are walking in a field, and Naoko playfully relates the local legend of the field well. No one knows where it is, and there is no encircling wall. You could fall down it at any time, and you would never get out. </p> <p>Finding oneself down a well, or otherwise underground, is an oddly charged possibility in Murakami. The well can furnish a kind of metaphysical holiday - the narrator of Murakami's masterpiece to date, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, seeks out a well bottom in order to \"think about reality\". Alternatively, as Naoko fears in Norwegian Wood, being down a well might mean suffering in despair, being swallowed up by madness, inexorably dying. The horror of the Tokyo subway shares this motif with Murakami's fiction: as one survivor tells him: \"The fear of going underground in a metal box and something bad happening is overpowering.\" </p> <p>Norwegian Wood, simply told on the surface, slowly reveals its own subterranean currents. Chatting to Midori's dying father in hospital, for example, Watanabe mentions that he prefers Sophocles to Euripides. The implication is that conflicts will not be solved by an interfering deus ex machina, but can only unravel in tragic violence.

      "bodyText": "Norwegian Wood Haruki Murakami, translated by Jay Rubin Harvill, \u00a315, 594pp Buy it at BOL Underground Haruki Murakami, translated by Alfred Birnbaum and Philip Gabriel Harvill, \u00a320, 309pp The men who narrate Haruki Murakami's novels repeatedly claim to be utterly ordinary. They live blameless lives, keep their heads down, indulge moderately in jazz and beer, hope things will stay the same. And yet something happens: the ordinary man is catapulted into deranged circumstances. He might be forced to hunt down an evil sheep that wants to take over the world, or to investigate his wife's spectral disappearance. Norwegian Wood, first published in Japan 13 years ago but only now translated for a western audience, might therefore puzzle the reader who has grown to love Murakami's haunting, melancholy surrealism: its action is resolutely realistic. And yet the narrator, Toru Watanabe, is just as baffled by life. At one point he writes: \"I have never lied to anyone, and I have taken care over the years not to hurt other people. And yet I find myself tossed into this labyrinth.\" There is no moral justice in Murakami's world; there is only the duty - both epistemological and moral - to try to understand. This duty also informs his first non-fiction volume, Underground. Murakami became obsessed with the 1995 Tokyo subway attack, in which Aum cult members released Sarin nerve gas on five separate trains. The book consists largely of edited transcripts of interviews conducted with survivors or relatives of victims. \"How on earth did this happen to us?\" one woman asks. \"That 'How on earth...?' \", Murakami comments, \"stuck in my head like a big question mark.\" No wonder: it is also the cry of pain that fires the depths of his fiction. Norwegian Wood is a love story. The Beatles song of the title, heard by the 37-year-old Toru Watanabe, is an aural Proustian madeleine that transports him back to his student days. Watanabe has started at university in Tokyo the year after his best friend, Kizuki, killed himself. Kizuki's girlfriend Naoko and Watanabe have grown romantically close since their friend's death, but their love is complicated by Naoko's depression. Naoko enrols at a sanatorium, and the lonely Watanabe meets another woman, the flirtatiously vulnerable Midori. Thus is his \"labyrinth\" woven: a choice between idealised love and eternally sworn loyalty or flesh-and-blood happiness in the present. The first chapter dreamily foreshadows the entire novel. Watanabe and Naoko, in the saturated colours and hyperreal detail of burned-in memory, are walking in a field, and Naoko playfully relates the local legend of the field well. No one knows where it is, and there is no encircling wall. You could fall down it at any time, and you would never get out. Finding oneself down a well, or otherwise underground, is an oddly charged possibility in Murakami. The well can furnish a kind of metaphysical holiday - the narrator of Murakami's masterpiece to date, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, seeks out a well bottom in order to \"think about reality\". Alternatively, as Naoko fears in Norwegian Wood, being down a well might mean suffering in despair, being swallowed up by madness, inexorably dying. The horror of the Tokyo subway shares this motif with Murakami's fiction: as one survivor tells him: \"The fear of going underground in a metal box and something bad happening is overpowering.\" Norwegian Wood, simply told on the surface, slowly reveals its own subterranean currents. Chatting to Midori's dying father in hospital, for example, Watanabe mentions that he prefers Sophocles to Euripides. The implication is that conflicts will not be solved by an interfering deus ex machina, but can only unravel in tragic violence. Subtle allusions to Thomas Mann and The Great Gatsby contribute further eddies. Such is the exquisite, gossamer construction of Murakami's writing that everything he chooses to describe trembles with symbolic possibility: a shirt on a washing-line, a string of paper cut-outs, a butterfly hairslide. Three times in the novel Watanabe reaches out to clutch light: first a sparkling mote of dust, next a firefly disappearing into the night. The third time he is strolling in the sanatorium gardens and becomes transfixed by Naoko's lit window in the distance, \"like the final pulse of a soul's dying embers\".

      "body": "<p><strong> Englishness Identified: Manners and Character 1650-1850</strong> <br>Paul Langford <br>Oxford, \u00a325, 389pp<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502369531,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Tourists to England are nowadays likely to come for aspects of its past: castles and cathedrals, royalty and Shakespeare. Yet in the 18th and 19th centuries, travellers came from Europe and America to find what they thought, or even hoped, would be their future: most of the foreign witnesses to England and Englishness gathered in Paul Langford's learned yet amusing study came \"to view tomorrow in the making, not yesterday\". </p> <p>\"I have seen the country in the world which is most worthy of our curiosity - I mean England,\" wrote Montesquieu in the 1730s. His curiosity was becoming common. In the 17th century the English were Europe's mavericks, notorious for their history of violence, turbulence and instability. By the middle of the 18th century, England seemed to many educated Europeans to be the world's most advanced civilisation: commercially successful, politically tolerant and culturally confident. Many people came in search of the secret of this transformation. </p> <p>So this book has a double fascination. On the one hand, it is a history of national characteristics, from eccentricity and clubbability to xenophobia and conversational inadequacy, showing how these were first invented or discovered: it is an archaeology of myths. On the other, it is a history of how others have seen the English (or the British, many being unable to distinguish between the two). Its interest, and its comedy, lie in the way that \"natural\" behaviour looks thoroughly odd through the eyes of an outsider, especially an outsider seeing a trait in the early stages of development. </p> <p>Take walking and running. Visitors found a metaphor for Britain's economic and military energy in its inhabitants' weird pleasure in locomotion. Bizarrely, going for a walk was a leisure activity. Stranger still, men, and even women, ran races against each other. Surely these were examples of a national restlessness - what the French historian Michelet called \"this terrible concentration of power, this desperate acceleration in a straight line, found everywhere in England\". The case seemed proven when French foxes were imported into England because of a shortage of home-bred quarry. It was reported that les renards were too short-winded to give English huntsmen a decent chase. </p> <p>This story also illustrates the combination of fairness and violence that perplexed outsiders. The puzzlement runs through Langford's account of that notorious myth, English \"fair play\". The English loved wrestling, boxing and football - the latter but an excuse, said one Swiss tourist, for street disorder and the smashing of windows. \"Anything that looks like Fighting is delicious to an Englishman,\" commented a Frenchman living in London in the 1690s.</p> <p>Yet the anglophile Voltaire persuaded many that English pugilism was \"a species of honour not known in any other part of the world\". By the end of the 18th century, travellers sought out boxing matches. Such violence was supposed to reveal, through its unwritten rules, the essence of English \"fair play\", and it had become \"received wisdom that it was a superior form of lower-class duelling, wise, humane, philosophical\". </p> <p>Langford catches the way English writers had already formed many of the standards by which foreigners were to judge England. He has always been one of the few historians of the 18th century to credit the power of imaginative literature, and here he shows how English literature shaped the expectations of non-English visitors, not least by generating waves of anglomania on the continent. The English novel, he says, was \"the single most potent agent of English culture\" outside England. </p> <p>Samuel Richardson's Pamela and Clarissa persuaded many that behind English reserve was a wealth of sensibility. Henry Fielding, thinks Langford, was largely responsible for establishing a national reputation for eccentric amiability - celebrated in his fiction and elaborated as a stereotype \"from the Vicar of Wakefield to Mr Pickwick\". Equally, it is telling that the most powerful influence forming a specifically Scottish identity in the minds of Europeans and Americans was to be the writing of poet and novelist Sir Walter Scott. </p> <p>It is clear that, as German teenagers nowadays expect their English hoteliers to pass for Basil Fawlty, French intellectuals once thought they recognised the innkeepers on the Dover road from Tom Jones or Roderick Random. Melancholy - \"The English Malady\", as the title of an 18th-century bestselling book of popular medicine had it - was also a settled reputation, owing much to literature.</p> <p>Shakespearean tragedy became fashionable throughout Europe from the 1760s and was taken to represent the gloomy spirit of the nation. Meanwhile, Garrick performing Shakespeare, one of the great tourist attractions of late 18th-century London, convinced observers by his naturalism that the English were honest and unstudied in their self-expression. </p> <p>Anglophile foreigners contorted themselves to find the qualities that explained the country's commercial and cultural success. In the 1820s, supposing that English bluntness was particularly enviable, fashionable young Frenchmen and Italians laced after-dinner conversation with phrases such as \"Damn my eyes\" and \"God damn\": \"Mr Godam\" was a standard French characterisation of an Englishman. Langford is especially good on the percolations of language. As he notes, \"In 1700, no educated continental European would have thought it necessary to speak or read English, whereas by 1800 it would have been considered essential.\" </p> <p>His history of words and attitudes teaches sharp little lessons. Post-war planners of public housing, for instance, did not notice what travellers had remarked over two centuries: that even the labouring classes in England strived to avoid communal living. The very words for spaces in shared buildings were foreign, \"flat\" being Scottish and \"apartment\" French. The English, noted a surprised German observer, \"prefer the most miserable cottage hired in their own name, to more convenient apartments in another house. The national character is discovered in this very circumstance.\" </p> <p>Equally, foreigners were as shocked by the scandal-mongering of the London press two centuries ago as they affect to be now.

Yet this is a petty cavil, for therein lies the book's richness: Langford has read widely and unpredictably, especially in accounts that have never been translated into English.

      "body": "<p>\" 'Zany' and 'funky'. I hate it when people use words like that about children's books. It doesn't really mean anything and it's patronising.\" </p> <p>Well, Helen Oxenbury's work is never funky, or zany. Its classic status comes from its combination of lightly observed humour and bold line drawing full of exquisite detail. The children she draws are real children, not surprisingly since the original inspiration for her picture books came from her own children, and her kindly eye and delight in them gives them a timeless appeal. </p> <p>Her most recent work, which has already won the Kurt Maschler Prize and has just been shortlisted for the prestigious Greenaway Medal, has been the massive one of re-illustrating Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Her young Alice is less sophisticated than many previous representations, though flashes of her knickers show her to be less innocent than she looks; the often terrifying Red Queen is more bad-tempered than mad and Alice looks like more than a match for her. It certainly fulfils Oxenbury's intention of creating an edition of Alice that is more accessible to children. </p> <p>The original commission for Alice came from Thames TV, who were planning an animated version. Along with a number of other illustrators, Oxenbury was asked to submit some illustrations. Hers were chosen but, after many months of work, the project fell through and Helen took it instead to her publisher, Walker Books. </p> <p>\"The trouble with Alice ,\" she says, \"is that it comes with its own illustrations - Tenniel most obviously, but also Rackham, and Mervyn Peake did a version. I had to think, 'How do I see this?' I tried to clear my mind and think how I felt about the book as a child.\" </p> <p>Like Carroll himself, Oxenbury based her Alice on a child she saw when visiting a friend. \"You just see something in a face, something just right,\" she says. Some of the other characters were easy - the white rabbit and the Queen. \"The Mad Hatter's easy, too, because you have such a strong vision from Tenniel. Others were much harder. But, once I'd got them, I wanted to open up the backgrounds, which Tenniel never really illustrated in detail. I have tried to give it a very English feel.\" </p> <p>Oxenbury has illustrated more than 70 books - both classic texts and original stories, and has won all the major prizes. She is a perfectionist, whose pile of roughs is a tribute to the care she takes. Her first critic is her husband John Burningham, himself a prize-winning author and illustrator. \"John and I show each other our work. I think we do it when we know something's wrong.

Maurice Sendak, author of Where The Wild Things Are, went on to design sets for The Cunning Little Vixen. \"With illustration, as with set design,\" Oxenbury explains, \"you are interpreting the ideas of an author, and where possible, you are adding - but most of all, you don't want to detract from the words, or from the actors or actresses.

      "bodyText": "\" 'Zany' and 'funky'. I hate it when people use words like that about children's books. It doesn't really mean anything and it's patronising.\" Well, Helen Oxenbury's work is never funky, or zany. Its classic status comes from its combination of lightly observed humour and bold line drawing full of exquisite detail. The children she draws are real children, not surprisingly since the original inspiration for her picture books came from her own children, and her kindly eye and delight in them gives them a timeless appeal. Her most recent work, which has already won the Kurt Maschler Prize and has just been shortlisted for the prestigious Greenaway Medal, has been the massive one of re-illustrating Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Her young Alice is less sophisticated than many previous representations, though flashes of her knickers show her to be less innocent than she looks; the often terrifying Red Queen is more bad-tempered than mad and Alice looks like more than a match for her. It certainly fulfils Oxenbury's intention of creating an edition of Alice that is more accessible to children. The original commission for Alice came from Thames TV, who were planning an animated version. Along with a number of other illustrators, Oxenbury was asked to submit some illustrations.

      "body": "<p><strong> The Human Stain</strong> <br>Philip Roth <br>Jonathan Cape, \u00a316.99, 361pp</p> <p>After dissecting the secret torment of Swede Levov in American Pastoral and documenting the public humiliation of Ira Ringold in I Married A Communist, Philip Roth consummates his trilogy of investigations into the post-war American psyche with another surge of bold, dense prose, fusing a tragedy of rare intelligence and emotional power from the fragments of truncated lives.</p> <p>As Levov was undermined by his daughter's revolt over the Vietnam war and Ringold was broken by his wife's complicity in the McCarthy witch-hunts, so, in The Human Stain, Coleman Silk falls victim to the resurgent puritanism that put Clinton on trial for a series of banal sexual indiscretions, inflated by the media into the rapacious progress of a Grand Guignol. In each novel, successful men are scuppered by historical forces beyond their control: zonked by the zeitgeist. The trilogy is given consistency by this tragic structure, refracted through the narrative voice of Roth's fictional alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, although each is self-contained. </p> <p>Zuckerman, living in retreat in rural Massachusetts, befriends Coleman Silk, a professor of classics who has resigned his position after being accused of racism by two black students. The charge against Silk revolves around a single word: spooks. \"Does anybody know them or are they spooks?\" Silk asks his class of a couple of absentees. He means \"ghosts\", of course, but the two students assume that he spoke the word with its secondary, barbed and racist meaning of \"negroes\". His colleagues either stay neutral or are swayed by Delphine Roux, the new feminist head of faculty, to side with the students. </p> <p>Through the story of Silk's disgrace, Roth captures the hysteria and absurdity characteristic of the era of political correctness. When the speaker's intention is disregarded and replaced by prurient suspicion, freedom of expression is sacrificed to the overwrought sensitivities of special-interest groups who, like Dostoyevsky's Underground Man, will pretend to find malice in the most innocuous words. Roth implies that PC abrogates the First Amendment. </p> <p>The stupendous irony in the charge against Coleman Silk is that he is himself black. Silk is an adventurer in self-identity, a man who has revolted against the inclusive \"we\" of the ethnic group, staking his existence on \"the raw I\" and its protean ability to change shape and migrate through chosen identities.</p> <p>Silk lives behind a screen of self-invention, occluding his black roots behind the meticulously maintained persona of an olive-skinned Jew. Only three times is his disguise seen through: by a black woman whom he dated as a young man; by Nathan Zuckerman, when he meets Silk's sister Ernestine at her brother's funeral; and by Faunia Fairly, the cleaner who was Silk's lover in the Viagra-fuelled libido-fest through which he managed to salve some of the pain of his fall from grace. To the society which exiles Silk, he is permanently unknown. </p> <p>Silk's relationship with Faunia, his \"Voluptas\" who conceals her middle-class education behind the pretence that she cannot read, is steeped in fatality. Raped by her step-father, abused by her husband and - after the death of their two children - compulsively stalked by him, she is as much a victim as Silk of the aggressive tendencies in American life.</p> <p>As the hyper-literate professor and the fake illiterate are double victims, so the moralising Delphine Roux becomes twinned in nemesis with the resentful husband, Les Fairly. A veteran of two tours of Vietnam, he is America's bad conscience coming back to haunt it, a return of its darkest repressions. When the narrative becomes infused with Fairly's voice, it snarls with recrimination and anger. The description of his failure to reconcile himself to the wounds gouged in his life is one of the novel's highest achievements. </p> <p>Equally powerful is the contrapuntal voice of Faunia, as she rhapsodises about becoming a wild crow and washing off \"the human stain\". She will arrive at the insight that the stain is indelible: \"We leave a stain, we leave a trail, we leave our imprint. Impurity, cruelty, abuse, error, excrement, semen - there's no other way to be here. Nothing to do with disobedience. Nothing to do with grace or redemption. It's in everyone. Indwelling. Inherent. Defining... It's why all the cleansing is a joke. A barbaric joke at that. The fantasy of purity is appalling. It's insane. What is the quest to purify, if not more impurity?\" </p> <p>Like Salman Rushdie, like the Greek tragic poets, Roth depicts a world in which humans are mixed-up beings, scrambled out of the odds and ends of inherited traits and acquired experience, animal propensities and spiritual aspirations.</p> <p>Sartre argued in Existentialism and Humanism that \"existence precedes essence\". Roth might retort that existence precludes essence, that human beings can never arrive at stable self-definition through their conscious activity. He maintains that this is not because we fail to recognise what we truly are, or because we have deserted God, but because human beings are the ultimate hybrid. Faunia, the crow-woman, lover of the veiled Silk, becomes \"reconciled to the horrible, elemental imperfection\" in us all. The Human Stain invites its readers to do likewise as it unfolds its resounding plea for tolerance.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Human Stain Philip Roth Jonathan Cape, \u00a316.99, 361pp After dissecting the secret torment of Swede Levov in American Pastoral and documenting the public humiliation of Ira Ringold in I Married A Communist, Philip Roth consummates his trilogy of investigations into the post-war American psyche with another surge of bold, dense prose, fusing a tragedy of rare intelligence and emotional power from the fragments of truncated lives. As Levov was undermined by his daughter's revolt over the Vietnam war and Ringold was broken by his wife's complicity in the McCarthy witch-hunts, so, in The Human Stain, Coleman Silk falls victim to the resurgent puritanism that put Clinton on trial for a series of banal sexual indiscretions, inflated by the media into the rapacious progress of a Grand Guignol. In each novel, successful men are scuppered by historical forces beyond their control: zonked by the zeitgeist. The trilogy is given consistency by this tragic structure, refracted through the narrative voice of Roth's fictional alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, although each is self-contained. Zuckerman, living in retreat in rural Massachusetts, befriends Coleman Silk, a professor of classics who has resigned his position after being accused of racism by two black students. The charge against Silk revolves around a single word: spooks. \"Does anybody know them or are they spooks?\" Silk asks his class of a couple of absentees. He means \"ghosts\", of course, but the two students assume that he spoke the word with its secondary, barbed and racist meaning of \"negroes\". His colleagues either stay neutral or are swayed by Delphine Roux, the new feminist head of faculty, to side with the students. Through the story of Silk's disgrace, Roth captures the hysteria and absurdity characteristic of the era of political correctness. When the speaker's intention is disregarded and replaced by prurient suspicion, freedom of expression is sacrificed to the overwrought sensitivities of special-interest groups who, like Dostoyevsky's Underground Man, will pretend to find malice in the most innocuous words. Roth implies that PC abrogates the First Amendment. The stupendous irony in the charge against Coleman Silk is that he is himself black. Silk is an adventurer in self-identity, a man who has revolted against the inclusive \"we\" of the ethnic group, staking his existence on \"the raw I\" and its protean ability to change shape and migrate through chosen identities. Silk lives behind a screen of self-invention, occluding his black roots behind the meticulously maintained persona of an olive-skinned Jew. Only three times is his disguise seen through: by a black woman whom he dated as a young man; by Nathan Zuckerman, when he meets Silk's sister Ernestine at her brother's funeral; and by Faunia Fairly, the cleaner who was Silk's lover in the Viagra-fuelled libido-fest through which he managed to salve some of the pain of his fall from grace. To the society which exiles Silk, he is permanently unknown. Silk's relationship with Faunia, his \"Voluptas\" who conceals her middle-class education behind the pretence that she cannot read, is steeped in fatality. Raped by her step-father, abused by her husband and - after the death of their two children - compulsively stalked by him, she is as much a victim as Silk of the aggressive tendencies in American life. As the hyper-literate professor and the fake illiterate are double victims, so the moralising Delphine Roux becomes twinned in nemesis with the resentful husband, Les Fairly. A veteran of two tours of Vietnam, he is America's bad conscience coming back to haunt it, a return of its darkest repressions. When the narrative becomes infused with Fairly's voice, it snarls with recrimination and anger. The description of his failure to reconcile himself to the wounds gouged in his life is one of the novel's highest achievements. Equally powerful is the contrapuntal voice of Faunia, as she rhapsodises about becoming a wild crow and washing off \"the human stain\". She will arrive at the insight that the stain is indelible: \"We leave a stain, we leave a trail, we leave our imprint. Impurity, cruelty, abuse, error, excrement, semen - there's no other way to be here. Nothing to do with disobedience. Nothing to do with grace or redemption. It's in everyone. Indwelling. Inherent. Defining... It's why all the cleansing is a joke. A barbaric joke at that. The fantasy of purity is appalling. It's insane. What is the quest to purify, if not more impurity?\" Like Salman Rushdie, like the Greek tragic poets, Roth depicts a world in which humans are mixed-up beings, scrambled out of the odds and ends of inherited traits and acquired experience, animal propensities and spiritual aspirations. Sartre argued in Existentialism and Humanism that \"existence precedes essence\". Roth might retort that existence precludes essence, that human beings can never arrive at stable self-definition through their conscious activity. He maintains that this is not because we fail to recognise what we truly are, or because we have deserted God, but because human beings are the ultimate hybrid. Faunia, the crow-woman, lover of the veiled Silk, becomes \"reconciled to the horrible, elemental imperfection\" in us all. The Human Stain invites its readers to do likewise as it unfolds its resounding plea for tolerance.",

The black masses saw that in this extreme nationalism lay their only hope... Mussolini copied fascism from me.\" </p> <p>Nowadays, you could see this as just a foolish moment. Plenty of reckless people found themselves enthusing about dictators during the inter-war years. Yet to Paul Gilroy, the author of this brave and unsparing book, Garvey's bragging is more than an embarrassing footnote to the history of black liberation. He asserts that Garvey's emphasis on racial purity, physical prowess and unity of purpose have remained features of worldwide black politics ever since, and he does not like the consequences. </p> <p>On the one hand he sees blackness being ever more defensively defined: by militant rappers, African despots and uniformed street organisations such as the Nation of Islam. On the other hand, he sees this identity being exploited - and outflanked - by the white-run global economy.

      "bodyText": "Between Camps: Nations, Cultures and the Allure of Race Paul Gilroy Penguin, \u00a322.50, 406pp In 1937, when Hitler and Mussolini looked a lot like the political future, the black American activist and visionary Marcus Garvey gave a disquieting interview. \"We were the first fascists,\" he boasted of his efforts to establish a separate black nation during the 1920s. \"We had disciplined men, women and children in training for the liberation of Africa. The black masses saw that in this extreme nationalism lay their only hope... Mussolini copied fascism from me.\" Nowadays, you could see this as just a foolish moment. Plenty of reckless people found themselves enthusing about dictators during the inter-war years. Yet to Paul Gilroy, the author of this brave and unsparing book, Garvey's bragging is more than an embarrassing footnote to the history of black liberation. He asserts that Garvey's emphasis on racial purity, physical prowess and unity of purpose have remained features of worldwide black politics ever since, and he does not like the consequences. On the one hand he sees blackness being ever more defensively defined: by militant rappers, African despots and uniformed street organisations such as the Nation of Islam. On the other hand, he sees this identity being exploited - and outflanked - by the white-run global economy. Black styles and physiques are increasingly things to be sold by international corporations to mostly non-black consumers. More benign developments, meanwhile, such as increasing intermarriage and migration and the discrediting of the old pseudo-sciences of racial difference, mean that \"the idea of 'race' has lost much of its commonsense credibility\". What is needed in its place, Gilroy says, is something more flexible and realistic, a loose multiculturalism that recognises difference and past discrimination but does not fetishise them. By page two, he has already coined a grand phrase for it: \"planetary humanism\". Such universal pronouncements require confidence.
