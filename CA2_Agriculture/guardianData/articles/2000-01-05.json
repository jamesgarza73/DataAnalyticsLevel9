But the way that the wicketkeeper's dismissal was replayed several times on the giant screen by the scoreboard operators was no less scandalous, and such abuse of replays has to be stopped to protect the officials. The previous two Tests, by the way, had been umpired impeccably. </p> <p>Silverwood was impressive. He has been on three tours now despite not being an original selection for any of them. This time he is here at the expense of Dean Headley, but he has leapfrogged into the side ahead of Alex Tudor by bowling faster than anyone else in the squad. </p> <p>He had enjoyed some good fortune when Herschelle Gibbs, on the second day, spanked a short, wide delivery to point, and Boucher's wicket was a bonus. But it only compensated for the luckless overs he had sent down previously. And the balls that dismissed Kirsten, caught at the wicket from a delivery with an old ball which surprised the opener with bounce and movement, Rhodes, who edged an outswinger to second slip, and Donald, who was caught in the same position from the back of the bat, were fine deliveries. </p> <p>The news of Flintoff was worse than expected.

      "bodyText": "Tauqir Zia, chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, yesterday began a campaign to save the career of the banned pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar by calling for video footage of three of the world's top bowlers. \"We have asked the ICC to send us videos of Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan, West Indian Courtney Walsh and South African Shaun Pollock so that we can compare Akhtar's bowling with their actions,\" said Zia, who is also understood to be interested in the bowling action of England's Darren Gough. Shoaib has been suspended by the ICC for a month on the ground that his action is illegal, although Pakistan have lodged an appeal. Zia rejected a statement by his board's secretary Shafqat Rana on Australian radio that the decision to suspend Shoaib was racially based. Rana said only Asian players were being affected. \"It was a very immature and sad statement coming from a very senior official of the PCB,\" Zia said. \"We accept the ICC and all its decisions but reserve the right to challenge its judgments.\" Yesterday Shoaib was sent home from Australia by the Pakistan team manager Brigadier Khawaja Mohammad Nasir, who said the affair was affecting the team's preparation for the one-day series against Australia and India. Shoaib has been advised by the former Australia pace bowler Dennis Lillee to spend a few days in a cricket academy in Perth to obtain film of his bowling action from different angles before his return. Three other former Test fast bowlers - West Indies' Michael Holding and the Pakistanis Imran Khan and Sarfraz Nawaz - will also be asked to help him.

Three more hundreds followed, including 275 not out against New Zealand on an Auckland pitch that had had its cracks literally glued together by the groundsman. That propelled him into the record books with South Africa's highest score in Test cricket, a score since matched by Gary Kirsten in Durban. </p> <p>Last year Cullinan was the sixth highest run-scorer in Test cricket with the highest average at just over 71, and he has begun the new millennium in this ever improving mood. </p> <p>When he reached 85 here he had completed 1,000 runs in Tests against England at an average of exactly 50. Of the 10 fifties he scored against England only one had been converted into a hundred, a statistic that would have irked him considerably and made him even more determined to go through to three figures yesterday. When he did so he joined Kirsten as the leading century-scorer for South Africa with 10 each. </p> <p>Cullinan has been around South African cricket for 16 years. He was the youngest South African to score a first-class century when he was 16, and he also holds the domestic scoring record for his 337 not out for Transvaal. </p> <p>He made his Test debut in 1992 and has a steadily improving record since then, the only blips coming when he has played against Australia or Pakistan. Remarkably for such a gifted player he averages under 13 in his 13 innings against Australia and has suffered at the hands of Shane Warne, who completely demoralised him. And he averages only 19 against Pakistan, the wiles of Saqlain Mushtaq and Mushtaq Ahmed proving too much. </p> <p>As a result he was thought to be a poor player of spin, but paradoxically he averages more than 50 against India and Sri Lanka, and the way in which he attacked Phil Tufnell by using his feet to hit cleanly down the ground suggested he had anything but a weakness against the slower bowlers. </p> <p>Cullinan has had one sortie into English county cricket when he played for Derbyshire in 1995. The variety of pitches he played on in that season helped to complete his cricketing education and his Test career blossomed. In 14 matches for Derbyshire he scored 1,003 runs but could not be enticed back, preferring to further his international career by concentrating his efforts in South Africa. </p> <p>Those efforts have paid dividends for him and he is now firmly where he wants to be. He is the most consistent South African batsman and is now forging his way into the top 10 in world cricket. He has capitalised on a beautiful wicket at Newlands and would dearly love to roll up the pitch, pop it in his cricket bag and bat on it at every opportunity.</p>",

One online reviewer, commenting on the high rate of severed hands, heads and tongues ends his critique: \"if you like slasher movies, check it out\".</p> <p>Titus Andronicus has been filmed three times before, but Taymor feels her adaptation is well-timed to examine violence at the turn of the century and reflect on recent atrocities in locations from Croatia, Cambodia and Rwanda to Colorado's Columbine High School. </p> <p>Taymor has set the play in Rome and Croatia, updated it with gun play and juxtaposed fight, feast and orgy scenes with surreal, vivid interludes. </p> <p>Describing her movie as an update of Pulp Fiction, Taymor says, \"Titus is not a neat or safe story where goodness triumphs over evil, but one in which, through its relentless horror, the undeniable poetry of human tragedy emerges in full force, demanding we examine the very root of violence and judge its various acts.\" Spoken like a true Tarantini.</p> <p><strong>In brief</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Fonda,+Jane\">Jane Fonda</a></strong> has split from her husband, the media mogul Ted Turner after nine years together.

Step back Pulp Fiction, Titus is here Those desperate to see Anthony Hopkins revelling in gore need not wait as long as the release of Hannibal. The actor, long hailed as a worthy successor to Sir Laurence Olivier, stars as Titus Andronicus in Julie Taymor's Shakespearean adaptation Titus, which has just been released to great acclaim in the States. Certainly punters expecting the jolly froth of Shakespeare in Love are in for a shock. Noted for her Broadway hit The Lion King, Taymor has apparently conjured Shakespeare's maligned first play about vengeance in imperial Rome into a veritable blood-fest. One online reviewer, commenting on the high rate of severed hands, heads and tongues ends his critique: \"if you like slasher movies, check it out\". Titus Andronicus has been filmed three times before, but Taymor feels her adaptation is well-timed to examine violence at the turn of the century and reflect on recent atrocities in locations from Croatia, Cambodia and Rwanda to Colorado's Columbine High School. Taymor has set the play in Rome and Croatia, updated it with gun play and juxtaposed fight, feast and orgy scenes with surreal, vivid interludes. Describing her movie as an update of Pulp Fiction, Taymor says, \"Titus is not a neat or safe story where goodness triumphs over evil, but one in which, through its relentless horror, the undeniable poetry of human tragedy emerges in full force, demanding we examine the very root of violence and judge its various acts.\" Spoken like a true Tarantini. In brief Jane Fonda has split from her husband, the media mogul Ted Turner after nine years together. The couple said they were separating but were committed to the \"long-term success\" of their marriage. Casting couch Miramax is planning a sequel to The Commitments and has hired playwright Warren Leigh to script a second instalment to Alan Parker's 1991 crowdpleaser. According to one Hollywood insider, \"The idea is to bring back some of the original cast. It will involve pairing some of the old faces with new ones, putting the back for a trip to America.\" It is not known whether Parker will be involved in the sequel.",

All day I have been able to ignore the pain from my bleeding feet and the infected sores on my legs knowing that it will soon be over.\"</p> <p>Ms Hartley, 34, a stage manager from Clapham, south London, who had no previous experience of such an arduous trip, said she had come through relatively unscathed adding: \"I have no injuries except a sore toe but I am very very tired. But I am thrilled and amazed.\"</p> <p>Mr Thornewill, 37, a police officier from Nottinghamshire, who was realising a 30-year dream, told the Daily Telegraph: \"I am incredibly excited, it is unbelievable, everything that we planned has come true. I'm feeling a bit tearful. It has been a struggle but it has been worth all the hardship, pain, and hunger. I am overwhelmed.</p> <p>\"It has been a hell of a journey for a married couple to go through. We knew we would be fine together but we have come back with a far deeper understanding of one another having shared something so demanding.\"</p> <p>Prime minister Tony Blair sent a message of congratulations to the three and called their achievement \"a wonderful start to the millennium\".</p> <p>Mr and Mrs Thorne had little experience of polar exploration. Before the expedition they had only spent 10 days at Spitzbergen in the arctic, a trip which gave them the idea for the nine-week trek. They braved temperatures as low as -30C, searing 40-knot winds, and the constant threats of frostbite and crevasses.</p> <p>Mary Alton, Mr Thornewill's 61-year-old mother, said the expedition proved the couple would go to the end of the earth for each other.</p> <p>Mr Thornewill claimed the experience had taught him his wife was \"far tougher than I thought,\" especially as she refused to leave her vanity case behind and carried with her a cake to mark his 37th birthday - seven weeks into the trek.</p> <p>The other British team, led by film financier Caroline Hamilton and including the Queen Mother's great niece Rosie Stancer, 38, a writer from Prague, set off some days behind its rivals and is expected to reach the pole next week.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British explorers achieved a double record last night when the first women and the first married couple completed a walk to the South Pole. Catherine Hartley and Fiona and Mike Thornewill arrived at the pole at 9.30pm GMT after covering 730 miles over 61 days and beating a rival team of British women, which included the Queen Mother's great niece. On reaching the pole, recruitment consultant Mrs Thornewill, 33, who suffered painful infection in her legs during the journey, said: \"I am totally exhausted and totally elated. All day I have been able to ignore the pain from my bleeding feet and the infected sores on my legs knowing that it will soon be over.\" Ms Hartley, 34, a stage manager from Clapham, south London, who had no previous experience of such an arduous trip, said she had come through relatively unscathed adding: \"I have no injuries except a sore toe but I am very very tired. But I am thrilled and amazed.\" Mr Thornewill, 37, a police officier from Nottinghamshire, who was realising a 30-year dream, told the Daily Telegraph: \"I am incredibly excited, it is unbelievable, everything that we planned has come true. I'm feeling a bit tearful. It has been a struggle but it has been worth all the hardship, pain, and hunger. I am overwhelmed. \"It has been a hell of a journey for a married couple to go through. We knew we would be fine together but we have come back with a far deeper understanding of one another having shared something so demanding.\" Prime minister Tony Blair sent a message of congratulations to the three and called their achievement \"a wonderful start to the millennium\". Mr and Mrs Thorne had little experience of polar exploration. Before the expedition they had only spent 10 days at Spitzbergen in the arctic, a trip which gave them the idea for the nine-week trek. They braved temperatures as low as -30C, searing 40-knot winds, and the constant threats of frostbite and crevasses. Mary Alton, Mr Thornewill's 61-year-old mother, said the expedition proved the couple would go to the end of the earth for each other. Mr Thornewill claimed the experience had taught him his wife was \"far tougher than I thought,\" especially as she refused to leave her vanity case behind and carried with her a cake to mark his 37th birthday - seven weeks into the trek. The other British team, led by film financier Caroline Hamilton and including the Queen Mother's great niece Rosie Stancer, 38, a writer from Prague, set off some days behind its rivals and is expected to reach the pole next week.",

      "body": "<p>Sherlock Holmes - and I say this on the basis of absolutely no evidence, having preferred Christie to Conan Doyle in that teenage crime phase - is a con. Like Hercule Poirot, he upholds the power of deduction over detection and tries to convince us that all crimes are soluble. But, in an arbitrary world, his confident application of reason flies in the face of the facts. Sometimes things just don't make sense; they are, my dear Watson, far from elementary. </p> <p>That, of course, is the secret of Holmes's phenomenal success, both in the late 19th century, when he captivated magazine readers, and through the 20th century, when Conan Doyle's books continued to sell in vast numbers and his other-worldly detective found new life on the screen. We want to believe that logic conquers all, but it is Holmes's brand which seems to be winning. Nor is there any sign of the interest flagging: there are numerous Holmes societies around the world and growing internet interest in the minutiae of life at 221B Baker Street. Conan Doyle attempted, unsuccessfully, to kill off Holmes (his fans refused to let him die) and, 70 years after the author's death, his creation is in as rude health as ever. </p> <p> <strong> Murder Rooms: The Dark Beginnings Of Sherlock Holmes</strong> (BBC2) is further proof of Holmes's durability. It suggests that the detective was based closely on Conan Doyle's tutor at Edinburgh, Dr Joseph Bell, a forensic pathologist who gets his kicks by helping the idiotic Edinburgh police force with their inquiries. Bell - obsessive, slightly potty, driven by some inner demon, always right - is, to all intents and purposes, Holmes, with the young Conan Doyle falling immediately into the Watson role. All that remained, this argument runs, was for Conan Doyle to run short of cash, summon up his Edinburgh experiences and write the 60 Sherlock Holmes stories. </p> <p>The Bell-Holmes theory is far from proven, but it made for an interesting hybrid - part crime thriller, part late-Victorian costume drama, part documentary about the genesis of Conan Doyle's fiction. Ian Richardson enjoyed himself hugely as Bell; Robin Laing was suitably wide-eyed as the young Conan Doyle; the blood flowed freely, and the romantic interest was only mildly irritating. There is a profusion of plot lines - dead busker, mad father, crazed student opposed to the introduction of women to the university, strange goings-on in a brothel - to be tied together in tonight's concluding episode. A con - but an enjoyable one. </p> <p>The young women in <strong> Au Pairs</strong> (BBC1) travelled abroad full of hope, expectation and trepidation; only the last of these proved justified. The children were impossible; the parents were worse; and the women, deriving no comfort from the company of strangers, couldn't cope. </p> <p>In the great tradition of docusoaps, this was intrusion masquerading as social commentary. Au pairs are manifestly underprepared for the work they do: there are dangers for them and for the children they look after. The programme had an agenda and it would be interesting to know how these three women were chosen: was there an expectation (a hope even) that things would go wrong?

      "bodyText": "Sherlock Holmes - and I say this on the basis of absolutely no evidence, having preferred Christie to Conan Doyle in that teenage crime phase - is a con. Like Hercule Poirot, he upholds the power of deduction over detection and tries to convince us that all crimes are soluble. But, in an arbitrary world, his confident application of reason flies in the face of the facts. Sometimes things just don't make sense; they are, my dear Watson, far from elementary. That, of course, is the secret of Holmes's phenomenal success, both in the late 19th century, when he captivated magazine readers, and through the 20th century, when Conan Doyle's books continued to sell in vast numbers and his other-worldly detective found new life on the screen. We want to believe that logic conquers all, but it is Holmes's brand which seems to be winning. Nor is there any sign of the interest flagging: there are numerous Holmes societies around the world and growing internet interest in the minutiae of life at 221B Baker Street. Conan Doyle attempted, unsuccessfully, to kill off Holmes (his fans refused to let him die) and, 70 years after the author's death, his creation is in as rude health as ever. Murder Rooms: The Dark Beginnings Of Sherlock Holmes (BBC2) is further proof of Holmes's durability. It suggests that the detective was based closely on Conan Doyle's tutor at Edinburgh, Dr Joseph Bell, a forensic pathologist who gets his kicks by helping the idiotic Edinburgh police force with their inquiries. Bell - obsessive, slightly potty, driven by some inner demon, always right - is, to all intents and purposes, Holmes, with the young Conan Doyle falling immediately into the Watson role. All that remained, this argument runs, was for Conan Doyle to run short of cash, summon up his Edinburgh experiences and write the 60 Sherlock Holmes stories. The Bell-Holmes theory is far from proven, but it made for an interesting hybrid - part crime thriller, part late-Victorian costume drama, part documentary about the genesis of Conan Doyle's fiction. Ian Richardson enjoyed himself hugely as Bell; Robin Laing was suitably wide-eyed as the young Conan Doyle; the blood flowed freely, and the romantic interest was only mildly irritating. There is a profusion of plot lines - dead busker, mad father, crazed student opposed to the introduction of women to the university, strange goings-on in a brothel - to be tied together in tonight's concluding episode. A con - but an enjoyable one. The young women in Au Pairs (BBC1) travelled abroad full of hope, expectation and trepidation; only the last of these proved justified. The children were impossible; the parents were worse; and the women, deriving no comfort from the company of strangers, couldn't cope. In the great tradition of docusoaps, this was intrusion masquerading as social commentary. Au pairs are manifestly underprepared for the work they do: there are dangers for them and for the children they look after. The programme had an agenda and it would be interesting to know how these three women were chosen: was there an expectation (a hope even) that things would go wrong? What sort of show would it have been if everything had gone wonderfully - a version of the holiday programme, presumably, with sunny scenes from Spain, Italy and Washington? For Donna, a 20-year-old from a tough Welsh working-class background looking after a two-year-old in Italy, things went horribly wrong. You knew it would when she arrived in the promised land to the strains of a gut-wrenching aria from Tosca. While the family was away on a skiing holiday, she was assaulted by a man from her Italian class. Where, one wondered, was the camera at the time of the assault? That begs further questions: how do docusoaps decide when and where to film, and to what degree can we trust the narrative? You were left feeling desperately sorry for Donna, but wondering too about the point of it all. The producers would argue that they were exposing a potentially dangerous situation and making a case for greater regulation of an industry that appears to be a free-for-all, but were they really doing anything more than expose the naivety of three vulnerable young women?",

Authorities found seven bodies and said another 26 of the 100 people aboard were missing, feared dead.</p> <p>\"They are probably not alive. The damage was so great that they could not have survived,\" district police chief Magnar Lynum said at a news conference on Tuesday in Elverum, located 10 miles south of the crash site.</p> <p>A fire that engulfed one of the trains burned for about six hours, leaving the wreckage too hot to search. Firefighters confirmed there were no more survivors aboard.</p> <p>Rescue crews spent the night in military tents set up at the site, 110 miles north of the capital Oslo.</p> <p>If the death toll reaches 33, it would be Norway's worst train wreck in more than 25 years. In 1975, two passenger trains collided in central Norway, killing 27 people.</p> <p>\"This is a catastrophe,\" said Norwegian minister of transport Dag Jostein Fjaervoll.</p> <p>The two passenger trains, with 100 people aboard, crashed head-on at high-speed yesterday about 110 miles north of Oslo. Seven people were found dead shortly after the crash and 26 more were missing and feared dead. Another 30 were injured.</p> <p>\"What we are doing now is bringing the bodies out,\" said Ove Osgjelten of the district police.

      "bodyText": "Rescuers at first light today resumed searching the wreckage of two Norwegian trains that crashed head-on and burned, killing up to 33 people and injuring more than two dozen others. There was said to be little expectation of finding additional survivors. Authorities found seven bodies and said another 26 of the 100 people aboard were missing, feared dead. \"They are probably not alive. The damage was so great that they could not have survived,\" district police chief Magnar Lynum said at a news conference on Tuesday in Elverum, located 10 miles south of the crash site. A fire that engulfed one of the trains burned for about six hours, leaving the wreckage too hot to search. Firefighters confirmed there were no more survivors aboard. Rescue crews spent the night in military tents set up at the site, 110 miles north of the capital Oslo. If the death toll reaches 33, it would be Norway's worst train wreck in more than 25 years. In 1975, two passenger trains collided in central Norway, killing 27 people. \"This is a catastrophe,\" said Norwegian minister of transport Dag Jostein Fjaervoll. The two passenger trains, with 100 people aboard, crashed head-on at high-speed yesterday about 110 miles north of Oslo. Seven people were found dead shortly after the crash and 26 more were missing and feared dead. Another 30 were injured. \"What we are doing now is bringing the bodies out,\" said Ove Osgjelten of the district police. He said it would probably take all day Wednesday and Thursday to recover the bodies, many of which were badly burned. A fire engulfed the trains, burning for hours and blocking efforts to rescue those trapped inside or recover additional bodies until early today. Some victims burned alive. \"The worst thing to experience is to stand there and watch people burn... going through that train and seeing people who were alive and conscious who we couldn't help,\" said Ola Sunderaal, an ambulance crewman who was one of the first on the scene. Officials said the search of the still smouldering wreckage would be slow and difficult, as many bodies will have to be cut out of the wreckage. \"One of the locomotives, which weighs 100 tons, is leaning and it is impossible to know if it is secure,\" Haakon Grimstad of the state railways directorate told The Associated Press. He said it wasn't even clear in which cars the missing victims were located. A group of eight Britons and a Dutch couple were on board the train but had all survived without serious injuries, police spokesman Per Ravnkleven said. A local train with 17 people aboard and a larger regional express with 83 people aboard were probably each going up to 55 mph around a curve when they crashed head on, according the state railroad directorate. The diesel trains - one southbound and the other northbound - collided at about 12.30 GMT at the Aasta Station in Aamot township near the town of Rena. The cause of the accident was being investigated. The section of track did not have a system that would automatically stop trains headed for each other, but was due for an upgrade next year. Survivors told of initial calm, then chaos and frustration. Passenger Rasmus Alme, 20, said he tried to save two old women who were caught in the wreckage, before the flames forced him to flee. \"It was terrible. I so badly wanted to save them,\" he was quoted as telling the Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang. \"The heat was so intense. The women asked me to stay, but I had to jump.\" In the despair, there were moments of triumph. Steffen Solberg, head of the medical team, said rescuers worked for four hours to cut a 33-year-old woman out of the wreckage. He said firefighters kept the blaze from consuming her until she was finally rescued. \"That was the biggest experience of my life. When she was brought out there were smiles everywhere in this middle of this tragedy and tears in many eyes,\" he said. It was the second serious public transport accident in Norway in just over a month. On Nov. 26, 16 people drowned when a high-speed ferry ran aground and sank.

According to friends of mine who went through it all with their offspring last year, you can't start the planning too early. Because, make no mistake about it, this first holy communion business is a big deal: get it wrong, and you'll have not only the wrath of the Almighty down on you, but that of a seven-year-old to boot.</p> <p>And seven-year-olds, as everyone who has one knows, are an excitable bunch. They're also made for an adventure like this one: still young enough to play with their Barbies, but old enough to stay up for Top of the Pops; young enough to be fobbed off with Ribena most of the time, but cool enough to know that Coke is where it's at. In short, they've started to understand self-definition, but rebellion - thank goodness - is still a few years away.</p> <p>Which is why they're so ripe for the first holy communion experience, with its chance to be star of the show in a white dress while being admitted to the grown-up Catholic in-crowd.</p> <p>That's not, of course, what it's all about, as I try to tell Rosie, my first communicant hopeful, as she undertakes her hundredth design of The Frock. It will, she says, be a white, fluffy number, with lace at the wrists and at the hem, and a lacy bit down the front. Fine, I say. But we mustn't forget, must we, that it's a religious occasion? We mustn't forget that your first holy communion is about God, not just about dresses?</p> <p>OK, says Rosie, without batting an eyelid. We'll remember God in the shoes: they'll be lovely white satin, and on one will be written \"Jesus\" and on the other \"Christ\". At least she hasn't asked for the latest first communion accessory from the US, a tiara which - at the flick of a switch in the pocket - lights up for the crucial moment at the altar rail when the priest whispers the words \"The body of Christ\" and presses the host of bread into the small, eager hands.</p> <p>It takes you back, having a seven-year-old going to first communion classes. I remember every detail of my own big day three decades ago. I remember the silky smoothness of my dress, and the scratchy net of the petticoat underneath. I remember the concentration with which I walked in procession around the garden before mass, so as not to trip.</p> <p>I remember scanning the pewfuls of proud mummies and daddies and the little leap of joy in my heart when I recognised my own, and I remember my devout prayer that I wouldn't fall over as I genuflected before taking my place. And I remember, before the ceremony itself, my fear that I would eat something by accident, breaking my obligatory pre-communion fast, like the child in the story Sister Mary related to us. She had to have her first communion postponed until another day, despite her contrite tears.</p> <p>Now it's all before my own little daughter and, though the shared experience will bind us together, one generation to the next, I also feel a little uneasy at the path she is taking and my part in ushering her along it. I am still a Catholic, but at times I feel I hang on by my fingertips. Like so many of my faith I have rejected, reassessed and realigned my beliefs many times: as one priest friend of mine says, I am one of those Catholics who has chucked away the table d'h\u00f5te in favour of the \u00e0 la carte, preferring to pick and choose rather than swallow the menu whole.</p> <p>While at times I am inspired by the truly holy people my church has moulded, at other times I baulk at those among its leaders who seem driven by ambition or cowed into silent submission. Then there's the church's sexism, which is as desperate as its spirituality is awesome; if I hang around because of the latter I am also forced, miserably, to endure the former.</p> <p>Pity, though, those parents who, though on the brink of lapsing, chose to remain in the church for a place in a Catholic school. Now, three or four years on, they find themselves sucked reluctantly back into the fold. Because it's not just the seven-year-olds who have to turn up for their first communion classes: we adults, too, have to show our faces at the regular parents' evenings, at which we are gently chided for our non-attendance at confession, and reminded that, for our children's sake if not our own, we should return, on bended knee, to seek God's forgiveness for our sins.</p> <p>There are also Rosie's questions to contend with. How did God make the world? Who made God? Where exactly is heaven? And, wherever it is, will we all be going there, even Daddy who is an unbelieving Presbyterian (and, as such, totally bemused by all this first communion stuff)? I answer as best I can, admitting a lot of ignorance - it isn't what Rosie wants to hear, but it is honest.</p> <p>At least I can ensure that she, unlike me, isn't misled by a misogynist theology: God, I tell her firmly, is as likely to be female as male, and there's no reason why we shouldn't refer to her as \"She\". To emphasise the point, I go through her first communion course handbook, writing \"or She\" alongside mentions of God as \"He\". Rosie, when she sees it, is appalled. Have I gone out of my mind, writing in her first communion book? She will be told off, and no one will believe it was her mother. Now she will have to go through it all with a rubber to erase my mad scribbles.</p> <p>Rosie is horrified by my unorthodox ideas - life is still black and white when you're seven, and she doesn't want to hear my grey thoughts. So I help her with her communion class homework as best I can, smiling as she gravely compiles a list of \"Who matters most in my life\" (God, interestingly, comes in at number eight, behind Granny and Granddad and bizarrely enough only just ahead of PC Coster, the local road safety officer). I suppress a giggle when shown a picture of a well-endowed Adam and a bosomy Eve in the Garden of Eden, and obligingly answer all her questions about where, when and how she was baptised. We talk about sacraments and apostles, the Devil and the Pope, the Last Supper and the First Easter. Oh, and the first communion day feast: is it to be a hired marquee, as her friend Sorcha had last year, or will we have a small family lunch?</p> <p>Amidst the preparations, I begin to wonder whether I really am all that different from my parents and grandparents and their unquestioning belief. But, at the end of the day, I do want to pass on to my children a cultural and spiritual heritage. It's a kind of ballpark for faith: if I hand it on, at least it's theirs to do something with. What they do, in the long term, is up to them. They might want to accept it, they might want to reject it, they might - like me - want to help it to change. There are times, I think, when parenting is about being a link in a chain: and however much you want to explain the link, however much you want to clarify it and overprint it with your own impressions, the bottom line is that you don't want to break it.</p>",

But that's not something Blair, a Newcastle fan, could ever be happy with. Forget all those worries about attending superpower summits with fromage frais smeared on his jacket. Blair will now be facing the fear that grips every modern Dad: what if my child grows up to be a Man United fan? After all, the new baby's brother, Nicky Blair, has already succumbed to becoming a Cockney Red, despite being brought up in Islington. </p> <p>Supporting Man United is fine, of course, if you come from Manchester. But for your child to support United when they live nowhere near the city is the equivalent of them choosing multinational Coca-Cola over locally produced organic orange juice, and about as inevitable. According to the latest figures, United have 3.3m fans in Britain alone. At the end of last year, as United won the Intercontinental Cup in Tokyo and claimed to be the world's best team, accountants Deloitte and Touche announced that Man United are also its richest. </p> <p>The club has souvenir shops in the East and Far East, and sells shirts in Japan and China. Its 1999 accounts reveal a turnover of \u00a3110.674m, with a profit of \u00a332.3m. Merchandising alone generated a whopping \u00a322.5m, which is a lot of romper suits, and more than the entire annual turnover of the English third division. </p> <p>United's directors now have their minds on the money-making exercise that is the FIFA World Club Championship, which begins in Brazil today. United's jaunt to Brazil has meant they've withdrawn from the FA Cup, devaluing the whole event. The danger is that United's triumphalist young fans will start to see the world's greatest and most magical cup competition as an irrelevance too. </p> <p>I feel that giving my 17-month-old daughter Lola decent footballing values is at least as important as checking school league tables. I could just about cope with her growing up to support the local team Arsenal instead of her Dad's West Ham. I even, in my wilder imaginings, see her turning out as a 20-year-old for the Doncaster Belles. But not Man United. I want her to know there's more to fandom than easy victories live and exclusive on Sky. </p> <p>Football means more than God to most children and, at its best, it teaches them lessons about patience, loyalty and faith. Every supporter knows instinctively that you find out more about life through 5-0 away debacles than from easy home wins. And, in the outside world too, you learn more about yourself when you're at your lowest. Be it in relationships, work or leisure, most of us don't have the personal equivalent of winning the league very often. Most of our seasons are mid-table or worse, but just occasionally we glimpse possible promotion or European qualification. </p> <p>There's even psychological evidence to support this theory, says Professor Stuart Biddle, who specialises in the psychology of children in sport at the Department of Sports Science at Loughborough University. </p> <p>\"In terms of having easy success, supporting Man United is probably not a good idea,\" agrees Biddle. \"Most psychological research shows that if children can learn to be a success as a result of being challenged, that's good. Affiliating with a local side, however, would be good for kids; it's good for them to feel a sense of belonging. When I moved to Leicester, we encouraged our kids to support Leicester City. Mind you, they do still support Man United as well!\" </p> <p>I've seen the United worries of my companions. They know that playground pressure may make their kid end up wearing one of United's three current kits - at \u00a329.99 per kid's shirt. I could almost feel the relief when my friend Michael, a Fulham fan, emailed me the news about his 10-year-old daughter: \"I took Lily to Old Trafford and she was yelling 'We're going up, we're going up, you're not!' at United fans. At school, she's now known as 'the Fulham supporter'. Supporting a smaller team gives her more of an identity.\" </p> <p>The Football Supporters Association (FSA) is certainly behind people supporting local sides. Chairwoman Alison Pilling says: \"Football is a live experience, but the Man United thing is more and more a TV product.\" She adds that, since she's taken her six-year-old son to watch the reserves at Leeds, which is free, he's really got into football. \"And after he's heard the roar of the crowd at first team games I feel - which might be me being a bit of a football snob - that he's more like a proper fan. Supporting a team is about being part of the crowd. You learn one of life's great lessons: you don't always win.\" </p> <p>Thankfully, many smaller clubs are realising they have to work to attract young supporters. Preston North End make their own shirts to keep the costs of replica kits down for parents and Charlton have a \"kids a quid\" scheme for home matches. Nearly every club now has a community programme, funded by the PFA, local authorities and companies. These offer football courses after school, at weekends and in the holidays. </p> <p>At third division Leyton Orient, season tickets for under-16s cost just \u00a323, and the club's community scheme is probably the best in the country. The football courses at local leisure centres are open to all ages, all abilities and both sexes, and a five-day course costs just \u00a330. \"On the courses we give out vouchers for free Orient games. Most of kids we work with haven't been to a live match so they really appreciate it,\" says development officer Neil Taylor. </p> <p>The Orient scheme does more, though. \"In our outreach work,\" says Taylor, \"we go into the local estates and try to use football as a means of getting kids off drugs or improving their schoolwork. They come in the ground and use computers, do their homework and see that the football club isn't such a scary place to be.\" </p> <p>Seeing your child make up their own mind about their local club can be immensely rewarding. My mate Dave has noticed a big change in his son Sam: \"It was United and the Spice Girls when he was seven, but now he's 11 he's old enough to start looking for individuality. He made up his own mind that supporting the number one group or team was dull, and that he was a target for the money men.

Very impressively, he went all the way and picked up on our local team, Brighton. He hasn't thrown out his Man United duvet and kit bag, just realised slowly that he was taken in by the advertising machine and he's made me very proud in so doing.\" </p> <p>The likes of Sam must be encouraged. The joy of winning a trophy is even greater - and my team West Ham did once win a trophy, back in 1980 - when you've known the pain of failure, and that's what our children will benefit from.

      "body": "<p>At the designated hour, my three oldest children came back from the home of their mother Dilys and her daft dearly beloved, Chris The Pillock. As always, my wife Angie and I were nervous. Gloria, Jed and Billy had been in fine form when we'd last said goodbye to them on Millennium morning, weary from their failed attempts to stay awake until midnight but happy, affectionate and warm. A lot, though, can change in two nights at Chez Pillock. And, sure enough, as they trooped in the mood was heavy. </p> <p>Gloria avoided my eyes, and didn't even kiss her baby half-sister Estelle. So Angie swept the girls upstairs to begin de-briefing, leaving me to probe the boys. Jed, as ever, kept a stubborn silence. Billy, as ever, talked and talked: </p> <p>\"Joe, you know Chris?\" </p> <p>\"Yeah, Billy, sort of.\" </p> <p>\"Guess what?\" </p> <p>\"What?\" </p> <p>\"Chris and his friends slept in a spooky forest.\" </p> <p>\"Yeah?\" </p> <p>\"And Joe.\" </p> <p>\"Yeah?\" </p> <p>\"Do you know what? </p> <p>\"What?\" </p> <p>\"There was a huge hairy man who came up from this lake, yeah? And Chris had to go and tame him!\" </p> <p>\"Amazing!\" </p> <p>I thought: \"Jesus Christ, the rubbish he gets up to on those Warrior Weekends.\" But I said: \"Billy, why are you calling me Joe? What's wrong with Dad?\" </p> <p>\"Oh, I dunno,\" he shrugged, and disappeared. </p> <p>We needed food. I piled the boys into the Vectra, telling them we were heading for a palace of sensual wonders, where men may learn the secrets of the feminine domain. \"Oh, no,\" they groaned, \"not Safeway.\" I wondered what horrors Angie was digging out of Gloria. Something was definitely up. Already, I was feeling raw. </p> <p>We pulled into the car park to find the family section full. I scowled through the windows of the occupying cars: no child seat, no child seat, no child seat. Bastards! When, like me, you've done a stint as a lone parent, you acquire an awful gift for moral fury. Then, right under our noses, two wasp-waisted young women emerged from a purple soft-top, with no children in tow. </p> <p>\"So where are your kids, then?\" </p> <p>The women looked at me, then each other. \"Where are your kids?\" I fumed. </p> <p>One of them raised a blood-red middle finger. \"Oh look,\" I countered, sweetly. \"It's Mrs Shit and her invisible kids. You ought to be on telly.\" </p> <p>\"Fuck off,\" she replied. </p> <p>\"Oh, right! How about these two? Can they fuck off as well?\" </p> <p>I pushed on, rummaging for a coin to unlatch a shopping trolley. Jed, being Jed, inquired almost inaudibly if he could put the money in, but my mind was still replaying the fracas with the women. Then Billy, being Billy, asked a lot more loudly. I passed him the coin. So Jed shoved Billy over, and vanished into the store. </p> <p>Furious, I searched the aisles, Billy blubbering in tow. One minute passed. Two minutes. Five. Then, at last, there he was, sulking by the Cheese and Owens. I was so relieved I could have hit him. But only women hit their children in supermarkets; men are too concerned with looking virtuous. So I just hissed at him instead: \"I thought I'd lost you, stupid.\" </p> <p>\"Sorry, Joe.\" </p> <p>\"Now you're at it. Why 'Joe' all of a sudden? What's wrong with 'Dad'?\" Silence from them both. Then something weird happened: Jed opened his mouth first. </p> <p>\"Mum, I mean Dilys, said we had to do it...\" </p> <p>So that's the little bombshell they've delivered from Chez Pillock, the reason Gloria was prickly and mute. Squatting among the snack foods, I squeezed out the details. Dilys cannot tolerate them thinking of Chris as merely a stepfather, a man of less significance than me. So she's stripped away the plainest symbol of my paternity, the designation \"Dad\". She's stripped herself of \"Mum\" as well. But that's a price she'll gladly pay if our children start believing Chris The Pillock is my equal - at the very least. Dutifully, Jed conveyed her miserable excuse: \"It wasn't fair on Chris.\" </p> <p>And what am I to do? I can rant, rave and resist and thereby make my contribution to tearing the kids apart. Or I can just give in. It's no choice at all. \"All right then, call me Joe if she insists. Call me Fred or Eric. Call me Desperate Dan. Just remember, I'm the only one who'll ever be your dad.\" </p> <p>That really got through to them. It had them thinking very hard: \"Who on Earth is Desperate Dan?\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Imagine your child in this scene. It's the lunch hour and an eight-year-old girl with a Tarzan hairband is spinning one end of a skipping rope. Another girl, from the same class, comes up and asks to have a go. She's only just started her turn, so says no. But the girl won't go away: \"Give me the rope, fatso.\" The skipping child just stands there, turning the rope and playing with her hair. \"I said give me the rope.\" The girl hands it over and walks off, pretending not to cry. </p> <p>Ninety-nine per cent of you will have imagined your child is the girl with the Tarzan hairband. But there are two young people in this everyday playground tale. Both are aged eight, both well behaved, both pretty ordinary kids who have just passed their SATs. We just have to start admitting that our child might also be the bully. </p> <p>This week, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) published new guidelines to tackle the \"insidious problem\" caused by bullies like these. Last month, a poll of more than 2000 Hertfordshire and north London primary school children suggested almost half had experienced similar verbal bullying, and a quarter suffered physical attacks several times a week. But the NAHT's solution to this perceived epidemic is startling: whether it's a case of sending to Coventry or prolonged punching, the accuser is always in the right. </p> <p>\"Whilst others may not feel that certain actions or words are of a bullying nature, if the recipient feels they are being bullied that is sufficient evidence to treat the case as prima facie bullying,\" the guidelines read. </p> <p>This is good news for the alleged victim. Whatever porky pies they utter, however they embellish their experiences with their childish imaginings, they will, initially at least, be believed. But for the child who is accused of bullying, these guidelines are very bad news indeed. \"Good!\" I can hear parents cry. \"It's about time those little bastards who harass my child were given a good hiding.\" But where is the alleged bully's right of defence? What if they were, after all, innocent? \"Honest, I didn't do it, Miss\" is no longer accepted. If a chubby child's pointy finger stabs in your direction, then you're as good as guilty. Nothing you attempt to say will ever get you off. </p> <p>But bullying is not a clear-cut crime. Unlike nicking something from another kid's locker, when the Bounty bar is indisputably discovered in your schoolbag, there's no hard and fast evidence that bullying has taken place. And what counts as bullying is open to debate; the NAHT guidelines list pinching, unwanted physical contact, name-calling and sarcasm as culprits. </p> <p>When bullying is interpreted so broadly, it's hardly surprising that the majority of children believe they have been victims. Nor is it a shock to learn from the Hertfordshire research that less than 3% admitted being habitual physical bullies. Yet even a five-year-old can see that these figures don't add up. Who would confess to being a bully and risk being permanently branded? The same research revealed how anti-bullying policies failed to work, based, as they are, on \"poor\" victims and \"bad\" bullies. </p> <p>The playground is a messy emotional landscape, upon which adults are trying to impose a simple morality tale. On one side of an uncrossable chasm are the victims of bullying - good children, little angels. On the other stand the bullies - evil children, little devils. But according to the same Hertfordshire research, most bullies have themselves been bullied. \"We need to get away from the notion that kids who bully other kids are somehow different,\" says Andrew Mellor, a teacher who drew up the Scottish Council for Research in Education's influential anti-bullying leaflet. \"Bullies are just normal folk. Their bullying is a result of the situation they find themselves in, but there's nothing intrinsically wrong with them. In a different environment, they might not bully at all.\" </p> <p>Bullying expert Barbara Maines, who pioneered the No Blame Approach, believed it is never right to single out one child. \"Even if the bullying is secret, behind the bike shed, one to one, we've always discovered that there's consent. We've always discovered that the other kids knew that something wasn't right and they've just kept out of it.\" </p> <p>All that punitive treatment of suspected bullies does is give one child the ability to condemn another. Their words alone can cause a classmate to be castigated. Ten per cent of secondary schools are said to have expelled a child for bullying. Six per cent have reported them to the police. The message to children is clear: don't try and sort things out amongst yourselves, however mild. Always get an adult to intervene. It's a policy that robs young people of any responsibility to reasonably negotiate with each other. </p> <p>When you next hear a tale of bullying, imagine this: the accused child is yours. Imagine that their best friend said they had sent them to Coventry. Your child says it's just that they didn't much feel like chatting that day. But that doesn't matter. The victim considers they have been bullied, so they have. Perhaps they are lying; perhaps your child is. But whatever is the best version of a cloudy truth, would you want your small child branded with that indelible mark? Bully.</p>",

Nor is it a shock to learn from the Hertfordshire research that less than 3% admitted being habitual physical bullies. Yet even a five-year-old can see that these figures don't add up. Who would confess to being a bully and risk being permanently branded? The same research revealed how anti-bullying policies failed to work, based, as they are, on \"poor\" victims and \"bad\" bullies. The playground is a messy emotional landscape, upon which adults are trying to impose a simple morality tale. On one side of an uncrossable chasm are the victims of bullying - good children, little angels. On the other stand the bullies - evil children, little devils. But according to the same Hertfordshire research, most bullies have themselves been bullied. \"We need to get away from the notion that kids who bully other kids are somehow different,\" says Andrew Mellor, a teacher who drew up the Scottish Council for Research in Education's influential anti-bullying leaflet. \"Bullies are just normal folk. Their bullying is a result of the situation they find themselves in, but there's nothing intrinsically wrong with them. In a different environment, they might not bully at all.\" Bullying expert Barbara Maines, who pioneered the No Blame Approach, believed it is never right to single out one child. \"Even if the bullying is secret, behind the bike shed, one to one, we've always discovered that there's consent. We've always discovered that the other kids knew that something wasn't right and they've just kept out of it.\" All that punitive treatment of suspected bullies does is give one child the ability to condemn another. Their words alone can cause a classmate to be castigated. Ten per cent of secondary schools are said to have expelled a child for bullying. Six per cent have reported them to the police. The message to children is clear: don't try and sort things out amongst yourselves, however mild. Always get an adult to intervene. It's a policy that robs young people of any responsibility to reasonably negotiate with each other. When you next hear a tale of bullying, imagine this: the accused child is yours. Imagine that their best friend said they had sent them to Coventry. Your child says it's just that they didn't much feel like chatting that day. But that doesn't matter. The victim considers they have been bullied, so they have. Perhaps they are lying; perhaps your child is. But whatever is the best version of a cloudy truth, would you want your small child branded with that indelible mark? Bully.",

He writes like an angel, even when he is writing non-fiction for hire. Embedded in the doughy mass of More Matter are 300 pages of superb prose. But you must look to find them. What was it Ernest Hemingway said - 'Less is more.'\" (Hemingway? Mies van der Rohe, surely.) </p> <p> Walker, in the FT, also mixed admiration with a drop of acid: \"Updike has ranged too far and wide, and perhaps too high. He has set himself up as a sort of national seer, archbishop and chief astronomer, and his landscape is not only hazy to the reviewer - you feel it is rather hazy to Updike himself... When looking through the lens of a creative imagination - his own or another's - Updike is superb. Otherwise, a grey man looms towards the podium...

Most of the pieces began as humble journalistic assignments, but you hardly ever get the feeling of Updike writing to order... His occasional writing is recognisably the product of the same pen, or word processor, as his novels and short stories. It is witty and observant; it takes equal pleasure in recording social surfaces - fashions, manners, idiosyncrasies - and penetrating beyond them, to the life within.\" Gross did, though, raise the old complaint: \"The chief weakness of his writing is excessive fluency.

Peter Cardy, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.nmss.org/\" target=\"_new\">Multiple Sclerosis Society</a>, says he has heard of industry \"invent ing\" advocacy groups. But he insists the major charities can't be bought that easily. \"They work with pharmaceutical companies where there are shared interests but never let them call the shots.\" </p> <p>The chief executive of the NHS Confederation, Stephen Thornton, is less trusting. \"Explicit advertising to the public by the pharmaceutical industry is not permitted. Yet worldwide, there is a staggering amount of pharmaceutical money invested in patient groups which puts their drugs on the advocacy agenda. That's why the role of patient advocates should be in helping to shape and design local services - not advising cash-strapped health authorities on where resources should be spent.\" </p> <p>He's also concerned that if more NHS funding goes to breast cancer others will lose out. \"Advocacy groups are becoming more apparent in NHS management - but it's an uneven marketplace.\" There are some organisations which are well-funded and have the ear of politicians and the media. </p> <p>Others have little or no clout. There are no advocates for heart failure or lung cancer, for example, and we can't have an NHS where those that shout the loudest get the most resources. </p> <p>It's a charge denied by the UKBCC which sees itself as a role model for less assertive campaigners. \"We're saying we want a bigger share of a bigger cake,\" says Coalition's spokesman, Graham Covington. \"Look at what the Americans achieved with money from the defence budget. No one suffered as a result of that.\"</p>",

Herceptin is already licensed in the US and will shortly be licensed in Germany but, as yet, there are no plans for it to be available in Britain. Elsewhere there have been concerns that advocates might be compromised if they were funded by the pharmaceutical industry which might profit from their activities. Peter Cardy, chief executive of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, says he has heard of industry \"invent ing\" advocacy groups. But he insists the major charities can't be bought that easily. \"They work with pharmaceutical companies where there are shared interests but never let them call the shots.\" The chief executive of the NHS Confederation, Stephen Thornton, is less trusting. \"Explicit advertising to the public by the pharmaceutical industry is not permitted. Yet worldwide, there is a staggering amount of pharmaceutical money invested in patient groups which puts their drugs on the advocacy agenda. That's why the role of patient advocates should be in helping to shape and design local services - not advising cash-strapped health authorities on where resources should be spent.\" He's also concerned that if more NHS funding goes to breast cancer others will lose out. \"Advocacy groups are becoming more apparent in NHS management - but it's an uneven marketplace.\" There are some organisations which are well-funded and have the ear of politicians and the media. Others have little or no clout. There are no advocates for heart failure or lung cancer, for example, and we can't have an NHS where those that shout the loudest get the most resources. It's a charge denied by the UKBCC which sees itself as a role model for less assertive campaigners. \"We're saying we want a bigger share of a bigger cake,\" says Coalition's spokesman, Graham Covington. \"Look at what the Americans achieved with money from the defence budget. No one suffered as a result of that.\"",

It kills over 140,000 people each year and, while one has to die of something, some 20,000 of these victims do not live to celebrate even their 65th birthday. Heart disease is often seen as a quick way to die. </p> <p>What is perhaps little recognised is the illness and disability it can cause. Over a quarter of adults now suffer from a cardiovascular condition, such as angina, heart attack, diabetes or high blood pressure. Reducing this suffering is clearly an important task. </p> <p>Tackling health inequalities, and improving the health of those in society who are worst off, is the new mantra of the Labour government. Heart disease is already a disease of deprivation and disadvantage. Today, unskilled men are almost three times more likely to die prematurely from heart disease than professionals. While death rates for the disease are falling, the decline has been unequal and as a result, the social class gap has widened in the past two decades. The risk of heart disease has almost halved in professional groups but the risk for those in unskilled groups has barely changed. </p> <p>With the political will, however, this leading killer could be virtually eliminated as a cause of death among under 65 year olds. The inequalities in death rates from heart disease are not simply due to inequalities in access to the health services and to treatment. They largely reflect inequalities in illness from the disease, as the recent health survey for England shows. The poor are more likely to suffer heart disease in the first place, and thus more likely to die from it. </p> <p>Furthermore, the main determinants of cardiovascular death are largely the same as those causing illness from the disease. Smoking, one of the major causes, is associated with poverty. The poor have poor diets, most marked in their low consumption of vegetables and fruit, not because they don't know what to eat but because of high cost and poor access. </p> <p>The disease, as government acknowledges, is largely preventable. So the priority has to be to stop people getting sick in the first place. What is vital for the health service bill, as well as waiting lists, is to stem the tide of illness and morbidity. To prevent cholesterol and blood pressure levels from rising and needing a drugs budget to bring them down; to stop children taking up smoking and needing nicotine patches in adulthood to help them give up and to reduce the number of heart disease patients arriving at the NHS door. </p> <p>There are signs, in the recent health survey for England, that heart disease rates have begun to rise over the past five years. The resource implications are clear: rising rates means rising costs, and rising waiting lists. Coronary heart disease already costs the NHS an estimated \u00a31.6bn each year. Hospital care for people with heart disease accounts for over half of these costs; drugs and the costs of dispensing them cost about a third. By comparison, a paltry 1% of these NHS costs are spent on prevention. </p> <p>But greater investment and focus on preventing avoidable illness would allow the NHS to concentrate on treating the illnesses that cannot be prevented.

There has never been a better time to secure an emphatic and radical change. </p> <p>The present government has elevated the fight against cancer to a top priority within the NHS. Research, though, has yet to receive any special attention. If prevention is better than cure - and for sound social, medical and economic reasons that is surely the case - then health secretary Alan Milburn must move meaningfully and generously to share the burden of research costs. </p> <p>I can offer him a model to work from out of my own first-hand experience. Back in the mid-1970s, the then ministry of overseas development launched the Pound for Pound scheme, a bold initiative to help voluntary organisations with their efforts in the developing world. I was the minister responsible for negotiations and consultations with those organisations to see that the scheme met with their requirements and with ours. </p> <p>Where a specific project was approved by the ministry, we matched the overseas aid charities' contributions. Our main criteria was to direct resources to the poorest people in the poorest countries. </p> <p>A similar scheme for cancer research would undoubtedly require a far greater government commitment to make a real impact. The UK spends about \u00a3130-\u00a3140m a year on cancer research, but the government's contribution is about 10% of it, a miserly sum given the scale of the problem. </p> <p>To be fair, the 600 or so cancer charities hardly help themselves by their failure to co-ordinate their case for more assistance. Prof Gordon McVie, director-general of the Cancer Research Campaign, which alone will spend \u00a356m this year, openly acknowledges that there is a wasteful duplication of resources, which is counter-productive, divisive and confuses the public. </p> <p>Apart from the CRC and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, where up-to-date facilities are extensive, there are umpteen smaller charities which are research-based or include research in their operations. </p> <p>Separate charities exist for almost every kind of cancer, and some donors clearly prefer to give towards combating that kind of cancer which has hit them or their families. </p> <p>So far as my own prostate cancer is concerned, I am uncomfortably aware that a mere \u00a347,000 went into research on it in 1998. One of the latest projects is the Pelican Centre, based at the North Hampshire hospital, which concentrates on precision surgery in the pelvic region, for which it says the world standard is 10 years ahead of the UK. It has an ambitious target of \u00a35m from donors by the end of 2000. It points out that more than 90% of cancer cures result from surgery, yet surgery receives only 1% of research funding. </p> <p>Worthy causes abound. It would be foolish to seek to inhibit giving to a particular favoured one. Nevertheless, needless overlap among the cancer charities is a matter for concern. It is not, though, an excuse for inaction by the government. </p> <p>Tony Blair has turned the spotlight on the Big C. There is to be extra cash and a cancer tsar has been appointed to ensure that what is promised is delivered. Even so, Britain's cancer specialists have said bluntly that this is nowhere near enough if the government's target of a one-fifth reduction in cancer deaths in 10 years is to be achieved. </p> <p>A Pound for Pound scheme for cancer research, with clear guidelines for applicant bodies, using additional government resources for carefully vetted projects to avoid replication, would be a huge boost for all those involved in this never-ending struggle. </p> <p>Doubtless, the department of health would need to put an annual cap on such spending, as does the DFID. But such an innovation would raise still further public awareness and increase confidence that philanthropy in this area is well justified. That, in turn, could mean substantially more donations. </p> <p>It would mean, too, a new partnership between government, charities and the individual citizen - a partnership to speed up and facilitate the vital research of those aspiring doctors and scientists who are the only real hope of defeating the deadly disease on behalf of generations to come. </p> <p>\u0095 John Grant is a former MP and minister in the Wilson and Callaghan governments, 1974-79 .</p>",

I can offer him a model to work from out of my own first-hand experience. Back in the mid-1970s, the then ministry of overseas development launched the Pound for Pound scheme, a bold initiative to help voluntary organisations with their efforts in the developing world. I was the minister responsible for negotiations and consultations with those organisations to see that the scheme met with their requirements and with ours. Where a specific project was approved by the ministry, we matched the overseas aid charities' contributions. Our main criteria was to direct resources to the poorest people in the poorest countries. A similar scheme for cancer research would undoubtedly require a far greater government commitment to make a real impact. The UK spends about \u00a3130-\u00a3140m a year on cancer research, but the government's contribution is about 10% of it, a miserly sum given the scale of the problem. To be fair, the 600 or so cancer charities hardly help themselves by their failure to co-ordinate their case for more assistance. Prof Gordon McVie, director-general of the Cancer Research Campaign, which alone will spend \u00a356m this year, openly acknowledges that there is a wasteful duplication of resources, which is counter-productive, divisive and confuses the public. Apart from the CRC and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, where up-to-date facilities are extensive, there are umpteen smaller charities which are research-based or include research in their operations. Separate charities exist for almost every kind of cancer, and some donors clearly prefer to give towards combating that kind of cancer which has hit them or their families. So far as my own prostate cancer is concerned, I am uncomfortably aware that a mere \u00a347,000 went into research on it in 1998. One of the latest projects is the Pelican Centre, based at the North Hampshire hospital, which concentrates on precision surgery in the pelvic region, for which it says the world standard is 10 years ahead of the UK. It has an ambitious target of \u00a35m from donors by the end of 2000. It points out that more than 90% of cancer cures result from surgery, yet surgery receives only 1% of research funding. Worthy causes abound. It would be foolish to seek to inhibit giving to a particular favoured one. Nevertheless, needless overlap among the cancer charities is a matter for concern. It is not, though, an excuse for inaction by the government. Tony Blair has turned the spotlight on the Big C. There is to be extra cash and a cancer tsar has been appointed to ensure that what is promised is delivered. Even so, Britain's cancer specialists have said bluntly that this is nowhere near enough if the government's target of a one-fifth reduction in cancer deaths in 10 years is to be achieved. A Pound for Pound scheme for cancer research, with clear guidelines for applicant bodies, using additional government resources for carefully vetted projects to avoid replication, would be a huge boost for all those involved in this never-ending struggle. Doubtless, the department of health would need to put an annual cap on such spending, as does the DFID. But such an innovation would raise still further public awareness and increase confidence that philanthropy in this area is well justified. That, in turn, could mean substantially more donations. It would mean, too, a new partnership between government, charities and the individual citizen - a partnership to speed up and facilitate the vital research of those aspiring doctors and scientists who are the only real hope of defeating the deadly disease on behalf of generations to come. \u0095 John Grant is a former MP and minister in the Wilson and Callaghan governments, 1974-79 .",

Whether the government would be prepared to step in and lower a budget in the face of big local support for the increase has yet to be tested.",

Her consultant told her he would prescribe the standard treatment, a platinum-based drug. She spent all the rest of the day going over and over the interview, convinced that something was wrong and trying to work out what. Suddenly it hit her. She had read in a magazine that the best treatment for ovarian cancer is now a combination of two drugs, the platinum derivative and Taxol. </p> <p>\"I phoned my consultant back and he said yes - that is definitely what you need. He seemed relieved. He wasn't allowed to tell me because the health authority wouldn't pay for Taxol, which costs \u00a31,500 a session and you need six to eight treatments. </p> <p>\"It was absolutely horrific,\" she said. \"It is bad enough being diagnosed with cancer, particularly advanced cancer. But then to be told that you can't have the best treatment that's available... It's where you live deciding whether you live. </p> <p>\"You just trust doctors, don't you?

Labour activists and trade unionists are signalling their overwhelming support for the retention of the traditional first-past-the-post system for electing MPs. Provisional results of a consultation exercise by the Labour party were leaked last night by supporters of the status quo. They showed that around two thirds of submissions received by officials at party headquarters were hostile to any form of change in line with the blueprint produced in 1998 by the commission chaired by Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the former Labour cabinet minister and SDP leader. If it is confirmed that around 1,200 submissions oppose proportional representation in almost any form, let alone the subtle \"alternative vote-plus\" compromise devised by the Jenkins commission, it amounts to a further defeat for Mr Blair. This grassroots rebellion inside the Labour party would produce a certain no-vote when the issue is finally dis cussed during the Citizenship and Democracy debate at next October's party conference. That will be an embarrassing moment for Mr Blair who knows that few of his senior colleagues and almost as few members of the party rank and file share his enthusiasm for the joint cabinet committee he chairs with the Liberal Democrats, as well as his personal hopes of an eventual centre-left coalition against \"the forces of Conservatism\" of left and right. The prime minister has kept alive the hopes of Lord Jenkins and Paddy Ashdown, both personal friends, and persuaded Mr Ashdown's successor as Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, that his intentions are sincere. But even Mr Kennedy now accepts that there is no chance of the promised referendum this side of the expected 2001 general election. Mr Kennedy is reported to be willing to break off informal co-operation with Labour if the referendum pledge is not renewed in Labour's next manifesto. In reality he is more of a realist and knows that a referendum lost is worse than one delayed.

      "body": "<p>Here is how to become a disaster statistic. Move to a shanty town on an unstable hillside near a tropical coast. Crowd together as more and more people arrive. Wait for the world to get a little warmer. More evaporation means more rain, which means the slopes will get more waterlogged. One day the land will turn to mud, and the neighbourhood will begin to go downhill. Literally.</p> <p>A landslide can accelerate to more than 320km/h. Nothing can withstand it. What roads there may have been are gone. Clinics and health services will have been erased. Rescuers will not be able to get in, survivors will have trouble getting out. There will be no food, no clean water. The uncounted dead will remain in the soil beneath your feet. Epidemics of cholera and fever will follow. The survivors will be so weakened as to be most likely counted among the dead next time.</p> <p>It has just happened in Venezuela, and it will happen again somewhere else soon. Peter Walker, director of disaster policy for the international federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in Geneva, has seen it too often. \"One, your house has been washed away; second, the land that you farmed has disappeared; and third, the mud and the debris have spread across other bits of land you might have been able to farm, so it's now useless.\"</p> <p>The catastrophe in Venezuela came in the last days of the United Nations international decade for natural disaster reduction. The theory was that as people were made aware of hazard, they would prepare themselves to survive it. It didn't work out like that. During the 1990s the world's population grew at the rate of 10,000 people an hour: 240,000 potential new victims every day, nearly 90m a year, almost a billion in the decade. Most of the growth was in the developing world, where people desperate for work moved to the cities, found homes on marginal soils, crowded into substandard buildings. Politically, too, life moved on. The idea that governments have an obligation to consider the welfare of all their citizens has been progressively weakened throughout the decade.</p> <p>On top of that, add climate change and global warming. Seven of the 10 warmest years have occurred in the 1990s. The other three were in the late 80s. A hotter ocean breeds fiercer cyclones and hurricanes. It surrenders greater quantities of water as evaporation, and more powerful winds dump this water against mountainsides with increasing fury. 1998 - the warmest on record - was the worst year yet for climate-related disasters. According to Red Cross calculations, 57,513 people died and 335m people lost their homes, or their livelihoods, or their crops, or their livestock, or their hopes. The estimated economic bill exceeded $50bn.</p> <p>\"Maybe it is the decade of heightening awareness to the fact that natural disasters actually kill far many more people than wars do. The figures for 1998 make appalling reading,\" says Walker. \"We have appealed for more funding [in 1999] than any year in our history. Part of that is Kosovo rebuilding. But in terms of natural disasters, particularly those associated with rainfall and cyclones, it has been one of the worst on record.\"</p> <p>There have been recent floods in Vietnam, Yemen and the Congo. Three hurricanes in succession hit the eastern seaboard of the United States, killing 14. People in Vanuatu were swept away by a tsunami in November. The death toll exceeded 10,000 when a cyclone hit eastern India in October. Avalanches in alpine France and Austria caused at least 55 deaths, and storms last month left more than 130 dead across Europe. More than 14,000 died in a huge earthquake in Turkey in August; within a month 2,000 were killed in a quake in Taiwan. There were more than 75 major natural disasters - floods, drought, windstorm, earthquake, avalanche, volcanic eruption and forest fire - in 1999.</p> <p>Experts believe that things will get worse.

      "bodyText": "Here is how to become a disaster statistic. Move to a shanty town on an unstable hillside near a tropical coast. Crowd together as more and more people arrive. Wait for the world to get a little warmer. More evaporation means more rain, which means the slopes will get more waterlogged. One day the land will turn to mud, and the neighbourhood will begin to go downhill. Literally. A landslide can accelerate to more than 320km/h. Nothing can withstand it. What roads there may have been are gone. Clinics and health services will have been erased. Rescuers will not be able to get in, survivors will have trouble getting out. There will be no food, no clean water. The uncounted dead will remain in the soil beneath your feet. Epidemics of cholera and fever will follow. The survivors will be so weakened as to be most likely counted among the dead next time. It has just happened in Venezuela, and it will happen again somewhere else soon. Peter Walker, director of disaster policy for the international federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in Geneva, has seen it too often. \"One, your house has been washed away; second, the land that you farmed has disappeared; and third, the mud and the debris have spread across other bits of land you might have been able to farm, so it's now useless.\" The catastrophe in Venezuela came in the last days of the United Nations international decade for natural disaster reduction. The theory was that as people were made aware of hazard, they would prepare themselves to survive it. It didn't work out like that. During the 1990s the world's population grew at the rate of 10,000 people an hour: 240,000 potential new victims every day, nearly 90m a year, almost a billion in the decade. Most of the growth was in the developing world, where people desperate for work moved to the cities, found homes on marginal soils, crowded into substandard buildings. Politically, too, life moved on. The idea that governments have an obligation to consider the welfare of all their citizens has been progressively weakened throughout the decade. On top of that, add climate change and global warming. Seven of the 10 warmest years have occurred in the 1990s. The other three were in the late 80s. A hotter ocean breeds fiercer cyclones and hurricanes. It surrenders greater quantities of water as evaporation, and more powerful winds dump this water against mountainsides with increasing fury. 1998 - the warmest on record - was the worst year yet for climate-related disasters. According to Red Cross calculations, 57,513 people died and 335m people lost their homes, or their livelihoods, or their crops, or their livestock, or their hopes. The estimated economic bill exceeded $50bn. \"Maybe it is the decade of heightening awareness to the fact that natural disasters actually kill far many more people than wars do. The figures for 1998 make appalling reading,\" says Walker. \"We have appealed for more funding [in 1999] than any year in our history. Part of that is Kosovo rebuilding. But in terms of natural disasters, particularly those associated with rainfall and cyclones, it has been one of the worst on record.\" There have been recent floods in Vietnam, Yemen and the Congo. Three hurricanes in succession hit the eastern seaboard of the United States, killing 14. People in Vanuatu were swept away by a tsunami in November. The death toll exceeded 10,000 when a cyclone hit eastern India in October. Avalanches in alpine France and Austria caused at least 55 deaths, and storms last month left more than 130 dead across Europe. More than 14,000 died in a huge earthquake in Turkey in August; within a month 2,000 were killed in a quake in Taiwan. There were more than 75 major natural disasters - floods, drought, windstorm, earthquake, avalanche, volcanic eruption and forest fire - in 1999. Experts believe that things will get worse. A burgeoning population will go on competing for unevenly shared resources in a world in which sea levels will rise and arable land will dwindle. At the same time as millions are made miserable by torrential rain and coastal flooding, many arid zones will become drier. Survivors of disasters will be in temporary shelter for years, at the mercy of increasingly inhospitable skies. That is because a warming world means a stormier world, as people in low-lying countries such as Bangladesh discover repeatedly, and as Venezuela has learnt, cruelly. \"There are 40% more intense Atlantic hurricanes now than there were 30 years ago,\" says vulcanologist Professor Bill McGuire of the Benfield Greig hazards research centre at University College, London. \"That's one effect of warming the sea.

      "body": "<p>It is lunchtime in the kitchen of an elegant house in Wimbledon. Cooker and sink are close at hand, but neither is in use. The two women present are sitting at a table instead, writing dialogue. </p> <p>Sudha Bhuchar and Shaheen Khan are working on their third series of Girlies for Radio 4, but I'm here to ask them about Balti Kings, the play they've written for the Tamasha Theatre Company's 10th anniversary. Now on in Birmingham, it soon starts touring. </p> <p>Baltis are a bit thin on the ground in Wimbledon and a trip to Khan's cousin's restaurant in Tooting would keep them away from the keyboard for too long. So we stroll a few hundred yards up the road, buy some sandwiches and eat them in the vast atrium of the Centre Court Shopping Centre. \"I feel a bit agoraphobic,\" mutters Bhuchar, who has spent a lot of time lately cooped up in kitchens. Not just at the Khans', but in the restaurants of Birmingham's Balti Triangle. </p> <p>\"Tamasha has a loyal audience in Birmingham,\" she says, \"and we wanted to give them something local. Whenever we're at the Rep or at Pebble Mill, we usually go for a balti afterwards. It struck us that in this country everyone likes Indian food, but nobody stops to think who makes it.\" </p> <p>The writers decided to find out. And the actors came too. Apart from anything else, they would have to learn how to chop onions properly and turn out nan breads the size of cot blankets. The on-stage cooking in this production is for real. </p> <p>Ten Tamasha members split into pairs and armed themselves with tape recorders. \"I think some of the owners thought we were from the Inland Revenue or Immigration,\" Bhuchar recalls. \"One or two refused to allow us in their kitchens.\" </p> <p>Khan intervenes: \"Mostly, though, owners and staff were really happy to have someone interested in their lives. These are people working 14 or 15 hours a day in a place where competition is fierce, margins are low and a lot of people are struggling to survive.\" </p> <p>Indeed, the plot revolves around the hidden threat from the Karachi Karahi Restaurant, set up by a wealthy Asian entrepreneur with the intention of putting smaller competitors out of business. One of them is Yahsin Anwar, a fictional figure whom Bhuchar and Khan are putting forward as the man who pioneered balti (in Sparkhill rather than Kashmir). His sons, Shakeel and Shahab, have plans to diversify with a buffet and \"curry-oke\" session, led by two visiting Bollywood stars. </p> <p>\"It's not a comedy per se,\" says Khan, \"but nor is it a dull and worthy piece about exploitation, which was the way Asian drama was seen at one time.\" </p> <p>\"We want people to feel free to laugh,\" Bhuchar puts in, \"and we hope they'll feel like going for a curry afterwards.\" </p> <p>Preferably in a karaoke-free zone. In a tense and heated argument, Yahsin demands to know why his sons want to waste good money flying in celebrities when they come in for nothing. \"Look at that wall,\" he says, pointing to a photograph. \"Loyd Grossman - who could be more famous than him? He walked in here himself.\" </p> <p>Apart from the generation gap and the financial threat, the other dramatic tension comes from the passions bubbling behind the great vats of food. The chef and one of his assistants fancy the same woman, a cleaner from Bosnia. Rare was the balti kitchen in which Bhuchar and Khan didn't find someone from Bosnia, either peeling spuds, washing up or mopping floors. \"They're all Muslims of course,\" says Bhuchar. \"In the play, Islam isn't an issue. All the characters live and breathe it. What we've tried to show is that, even though people come from the same culture, they don't necessarily all turn out the same. These are multi-layered characters.\" </p> <p>Sudha Bhuchar herself is a Hindu married to a Muslim. Shaheen Khan is a Muslim married to a Jew. Both women came to this country from east Africa when they were 11 - Khan in 1971 and Bhuchar three years later. Both have a working knowledge of Punjabi, which stood them in good stead during their research. Their skill as writers has been to turn this knockabout street language into English that Asians can believe in yet can be also clearly understood by the whites in the audience. </p> <p>The success of East is East has given Tamasha a new appetite for cultural crossover. It was this company which commissioned Ayub Khan-Din's Salford saga and backed it financially. So could history be about to repeat itself? After all, the balti has conquered not just Birmingham but most of Britain. Radio 4 is already committed to turning the play into a six-part series, and this production is due to play in places like Oxford and Plymouth, not renowned for their non-white populations. </p> <p>\"We'd love to turn it into a film and try to keep some control over it,\" says Kristine Landon-Smith, co-founder of Tamasha with Bhuchar, and the director of Balti Kings. She's on the other side of London, just off the Caledonian Road, in a rehearsal room strewn with metal karahis, boxes of poppadoms and bowls full of potatoes. </p> <p>Landon-Smith has a pounding headache but remains exhilarated by the script, judging by the effort she's been putting into conveying every nuance to actors who are having to remember their lines while moulding pastry or chopping vegetables. \"It would have been lazy of us not to have cooking on stage,\" she says. \"It helps the audience to believe that a buffet of 35 dishes is being created before their eyes.\" </p> <p>And if some of the audience wonder why their eyes are streaming, it could be the writing. Or it could be the onions.</p> <p>\u0095 Balti Kings is at Birmingham Rep (0121-236 4455) till Saturday, the Lyric Hammersmith, London W6 (0181-741 2311), from January 12 to February 19, then touring</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is lunchtime in the kitchen of an elegant house in Wimbledon. Cooker and sink are close at hand, but neither is in use. The two women present are sitting at a table instead, writing dialogue. Sudha Bhuchar and Shaheen Khan are working on their third series of Girlies for Radio 4, but I'm here to ask them about Balti Kings, the play they've written for the Tamasha Theatre Company's 10th anniversary. Now on in Birmingham, it soon starts touring. Baltis are a bit thin on the ground in Wimbledon and a trip to Khan's cousin's restaurant in Tooting would keep them away from the keyboard for too long. So we stroll a few hundred yards up the road, buy some sandwiches and eat them in the vast atrium of the Centre Court Shopping Centre. \"I feel a bit agoraphobic,\" mutters Bhuchar, who has spent a lot of time lately cooped up in kitchens. Not just at the Khans', but in the restaurants of Birmingham's Balti Triangle. \"Tamasha has a loyal audience in Birmingham,\" she says, \"and we wanted to give them something local. Whenever we're at the Rep or at Pebble Mill, we usually go for a balti afterwards. It struck us that in this country everyone likes Indian food, but nobody stops to think who makes it.\" The writers decided to find out. And the actors came too. Apart from anything else, they would have to learn how to chop onions properly and turn out nan breads the size of cot blankets. The on-stage cooking in this production is for real. Ten Tamasha members split into pairs and armed themselves with tape recorders. \"I think some of the owners thought we were from the Inland Revenue or Immigration,\" Bhuchar recalls. \"One or two refused to allow us in their kitchens.\" Khan intervenes: \"Mostly, though, owners and staff were really happy to have someone interested in their lives. These are people working 14 or 15 hours a day in a place where competition is fierce, margins are low and a lot of people are struggling to survive.\" Indeed, the plot revolves around the hidden threat from the Karachi Karahi Restaurant, set up by a wealthy Asian entrepreneur with the intention of putting smaller competitors out of business. One of them is Yahsin Anwar, a fictional figure whom Bhuchar and Khan are putting forward as the man who pioneered balti (in Sparkhill rather than Kashmir). His sons, Shakeel and Shahab, have plans to diversify with a buffet and \"curry-oke\" session, led by two visiting Bollywood stars. \"It's not a comedy per se,\" says Khan, \"but nor is it a dull and worthy piece about exploitation, which was the way Asian drama was seen at one time.\" \"We want people to feel free to laugh,\" Bhuchar puts in, \"and we hope they'll feel like going for a curry afterwards.\" Preferably in a karaoke-free zone. In a tense and heated argument, Yahsin demands to know why his sons want to waste good money flying in celebrities when they come in for nothing. \"Look at that wall,\" he says, pointing to a photograph. \"Loyd Grossman - who could be more famous than him? He walked in here himself.\" Apart from the generation gap and the financial threat, the other dramatic tension comes from the passions bubbling behind the great vats of food. The chef and one of his assistants fancy the same woman, a cleaner from Bosnia. Rare was the balti kitchen in which Bhuchar and Khan didn't find someone from Bosnia, either peeling spuds, washing up or mopping floors. \"They're all Muslims of course,\" says Bhuchar. \"In the play, Islam isn't an issue. All the characters live and breathe it. What we've tried to show is that, even though people come from the same culture, they don't necessarily all turn out the same. These are multi-layered characters.\" Sudha Bhuchar herself is a Hindu married to a Muslim. Shaheen Khan is a Muslim married to a Jew. Both women came to this country from east Africa when they were 11 - Khan in 1971 and Bhuchar three years later. Both have a working knowledge of Punjabi, which stood them in good stead during their research. Their skill as writers has been to turn this knockabout street language into English that Asians can believe in yet can be also clearly understood by the whites in the audience. The success of East is East has given Tamasha a new appetite for cultural crossover. It was this company which commissioned Ayub Khan-Din's Salford saga and backed it financially. So could history be about to repeat itself? After all, the balti has conquered not just Birmingham but most of Britain. Radio 4 is already committed to turning the play into a six-part series, and this production is due to play in places like Oxford and Plymouth, not renowned for their non-white populations. \"We'd love to turn it into a film and try to keep some control over it,\" says Kristine Landon-Smith, co-founder of Tamasha with Bhuchar, and the director of Balti Kings. She's on the other side of London, just off the Caledonian Road, in a rehearsal room strewn with metal karahis, boxes of poppadoms and bowls full of potatoes. Landon-Smith has a pounding headache but remains exhilarated by the script, judging by the effort she's been putting into conveying every nuance to actors who are having to remember their lines while moulding pastry or chopping vegetables. \"It would have been lazy of us not to have cooking on stage,\" she says. \"It helps the audience to believe that a buffet of 35 dishes is being created before their eyes.\" And if some of the audience wonder why their eyes are streaming, it could be the writing. Or it could be the onions. \u0095 Balti Kings is at Birmingham Rep (0121-236 4455) till Saturday, the Lyric Hammersmith, London W6 (0181-741 2311), from January 12 to February 19, then touring",

Time passing is better marked by extravagant celebration than with wars or monarch's reigns. </p> <p>But alas this is not a great exhibition. It is a deep disappointment. It doesn't work on any level, from the most mundane purchase of a cup of coffee to any bit of really good fun. Lord Falconer is busy apologising to the VIPs for their chaotic first night queuing, but he'd better stand at the door grovelling to the paying public too. There is a replica pillory just outside where the queues could pelt him with rotten vegetables (except the management would run out of vegetables, as they run out of everything else). </p> <p>As a Dome enthusiast, I bought 10 tickets ages ago to take my family for the day: \u00a320 a head didn't seem exorbitant for the \"Amazing Day\" promised. (I pass over the difficulty of buying tickets from a local lottery outlet that had never heard of the Dome.) Hugo Young, writing here yesterday about his dismal experience as one of the 10,000 VIPs invited for the night itself, was subjected to the added insult of having to listen to high-flown political boasting about the Dome's high purpose. But I never had elevated expectations of finding millennial meaning in the Dome. All that was required was a bit of Wow! Any old Wow! would have done - fantastic rides, an amazing spectacle, something witty, startling futurism, geewhiz science, anything memorable would do. </p> <p>The trouble with queuing is that expectations rise exponentially with every minute queued. If you stand outside the body zone for an hour it had better be worth it, but all you get is seven minutes of nothing much. The mildly surreal beating of a heart or Tommy Cooper's brain telling jokes is an utterly inadequate reward for those who have queued angrily for so long. </p> <p>And there were queues for almost everything worth seeing, (none for the faith zone), so in eight hours I couldn't see all the zones: maybe I missed something wonderful, but I doubt it. Who are we, one zone asks? British phlegm and patience suggests we are people who queue with pride, the same odd British psyche that celebrates the Dunkirk spirit: there was no rebellion, have-a-nice-day hosts were not lynched and no one ran amok. Having queued 45 minutes for a coffee, for lunch we chose what looked like the shortest food queue. An hour later we reached the Trade Winds serving hatch: all the food had run out. In fact, everything, everywhere ran out - though it was rumoured you could get a McDonald's in only 15 minutes. </p> <p>But the serious problem is that there was nothing worth queuing for. At a breezy gallop the whole experience could be quite fun. But in the play zone, with long queues for each item, none of the games approach the ones most kids have at home: Nintendo's Golden Eye makes these look like ancient history. </p> <p>The best, a team game played by a hundred at a time, was pretty feeble. It came, like everything else, with a moral message about teamwork (though actually it proved the opposite). The moral messages in the work zone were unpleasantly threatening (No Skills, No Job), breeding instinctive rebellion, and the \"hand-eye co-ordination\" games insulting to the idea of serious skill. Parents of young children were complaining bitterly at how bored they were. Teenagers made disparaging comparisons with modern arcade machines. </p> <p>Everywhere high minded messages are matched with low tech exhibits. Nothing here is as astounding as the internet, nothing is as creative as the best television programmes, all of it assem bled by exhibition organisers with nothing to exhibit. The best space is wasted on a vast auditorium for a show of ugly banality: the West End does better with almost any musical, De La Guarda has more dazzling dance and acrobatics and the fair outside Buckingham Palace had far better rides. In days of austerity the Festival of Britain had no competition, but the Dome can't contend with state of the art modern entertainment already so full of creative Wow! </p> <p>If they had acknowledged that problem from the start they would have handed the central theme over to artists, the only begetters of anything good here. What's memorable is the building itself, grubby by day but startling when lit at night like a iridescent jellyfish. The body zone as a sculpture is a wonderful thing in shimmering orange tiles, but crammed in a corner its splendour is diminished. Inside the otherwise mindless mind zone is a lovely statue of a squatting boy. </p> <p> On a platform in the river a fine Antony Gormley work rises in silvery jagged shapes. Gerald Scarfe's splenetic sculptures shine in an otherwise dead zone, while the rest zone is a beautiful, empty, illuminated igloo. If you can shut your eyes passing through the faith zone's appalling sententious sayings and theology for morons, inside there is a miraculous blue spiral light sculpture by James Tirrell. </p> <p>There never could have been message or meaning in an exhibition of this kind. In the end only art transcends the platitudes of politicians, the empty exhortations and the hollow Christian attempts to impose a banality of its own. The lesson is that only those elements created by artists have meaning. Sadly they are too few and far between to rescue the Dome, but in future this should tell governments to rely on artists whose work will long outlast them. Who cares now what event Handel's Water Music celebrated? </p> <p>Is it too late to redesign and refine the Dome over the next months? They could still junk the worst and move more art to centre-stage. To make it a bearable day out, they must halve the number of tickets sold - though word of mouth alone may do that.

      "body": "<p>The end of the 20th century was a good time for what used to be known as the Little Fellow. Comedian Norman Wisdom - a favourite of the Queen, and a living legend in Albania, where he's known as \"Pitkini\" - was listed for a knighthood. And Mickey Mouse made a comeback in what many consider his finest hour, the Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence from Disney's Fantasia (1940), now incorporated into the bigger, louder Imax extravaganza, Fantasia 2000. </p> <p>Although critics over 18 didn't rate the film much, prepubescent viewers vox-popped by this paper enthusiastically agreed that the original Mickey sequence was the best in the film. That ought to prove the undying appeal of Mousehood, but I have my doubts. The Sorcerer's Apprentice and its star may well be timeless, but only in the particular sense in which a cultural phenomenon is entirely of its time, absolutely represents its age, and is therefore dated, albeit in a transcendental way. </p> <p>Standing specifically for the last century, Mickey has no chance of making it as an icon into the 21st. He's a curiously repellent figure in ways that only the professionally lovable can be.

For that, we do have a model: Jacques Tati, like a distracted stork legging and pecking his way through the attractions of the post-modern consumer metropolis in his under-rated 1967 masterpiece, Playtime.

      "bodyText": "The end of the 20th century was a good time for what used to be known as the Little Fellow. Comedian Norman Wisdom - a favourite of the Queen, and a living legend in Albania, where he's known as \"Pitkini\" - was listed for a knighthood. And Mickey Mouse made a comeback in what many consider his finest hour, the Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence from Disney's Fantasia (1940), now incorporated into the bigger, louder Imax extravaganza, Fantasia 2000. Although critics over 18 didn't rate the film much, prepubescent viewers vox-popped by this paper enthusiastically agreed that the original Mickey sequence was the best in the film. That ought to prove the undying appeal of Mousehood, but I have my doubts. The Sorcerer's Apprentice and its star may well be timeless, but only in the particular sense in which a cultural phenomenon is entirely of its time, absolutely represents its age, and is therefore dated, albeit in a transcendental way. Standing specifically for the last century, Mickey has no chance of making it as an icon into the 21st. He's a curiously repellent figure in ways that only the professionally lovable can be. His history is one of rapid institutionalisation and embourgeoisement, from the surreal elastic imp of the 20s to the tolerant suburban patriarch and corporate spokesman he had become by the 50s. The lanky, rubbery hero of 1928's Steamboat Willie is a bizarre, elemental creature, but it didn't take the corporation long to make him stocky and leaden, formalise his costume and turn him into a smiling yes man, glad- handing theme-park punters.

He hatched the plot - at the height of the war - with President Roosevelt who also strongly distrusted the man who was later to lead a French revival based on national pride and deep suspicion of the United States and Britain. The mutual antipathy between Churchill and De Gaulle, who spent most of the war in London, is well documented, but the lengths to which Britain's wartime leader was ready to go to get rid of the man who was to be France's greatest postwar statesman has never been disclosed until now. British diplomats in Paris were uneasy when they were told recently about the decision to release the papers at the public records office. The documents consist mainly of a series of coded telegrams between London and Washington, where Churchill was holding talks with Roosevelt. In a furious dispute with his war cabinet in May 1943, Churchill told Clement Attlee, his deputy prime minister, and Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary: \"I ask my colleagues to consider urgently whether we should not now eliminate De Gaulle as a political force.\" De Gaulle, said Churchill in this May 21 cable, \"hates England and has left a trail of Anglophobia behind him everywhere\". The man's removal was necessary, given Britain's \"absolutely vital interest in preserving good relations with the United States\". Churchill sent his cabinet colleagues a personal memo he received from Roosevelt describing De Gaulle as having a \"messianic complex\" with \"dictatorial\" tendencies. The US president added: \"He has the idea that the people of France itself are strongly behind him personally.

Or at least some of Blair's boys did a couple of years ago in an attempt to spin doctor this sceptr'd isle into something hip, hop and happening.</p> <p>It didn't exactly work. A recent survey of the way Britain is perceived after two years of feverish rebranding shows that Johnny and Janet Foreigner still think of the United Kingdom as being old fashioned, grubby and interestingly cranky. All those heaving bars and cafes lining the streets of fashionable city centres designed by standard-issue, goatee-sporting young architects can't dent an internationally recognised aesthetic rooted in hundreds of years of class distinction, pigeon-fancying, warm beer and supermarket food.

Or at least some of Blair's boys did a couple of years ago in an attempt to spin doctor this sceptr'd isle into something hip, hop and happening. It didn't exactly work.

      "trailText": "<p>His films are beguiling and convoluted tales in the magical-realist vein, but Basque director Julio Medem tells  Dan Glaister they are based on real life - his own</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Julio Medem is excited. No, let's be honest about this: Julio Medem is hugely excited. In London for a day to talk about his latest, fourth feature film, The Lovers of the Arctic Circle, the soft-spoken Basque director can talk about nothing more than his fifth film, as yet untitled, which he had finished writing the night before. \"I have a sty,\" he says, pointing to a red mark on his lower eyelid. \"I was staring for so long at my computer screen - and the protective filter is broken - that it gave me a sty.\" </p> <p>The Lovers of the Arctic Circle takes Medem's usual preoccupations - love, death, nature, accident - and wraps them up in a typically convoluted, magical-realist tract. We meet the lovers in question, the palindromically challenged Ana and Otto, as they race each other through the woods. But at this stage, aged eight or so, they do not yet know that they are to be lovers. They are merely running, against each other and with each other, the boy chasing a football, the girl running away from her mother. From such simple schoolyard beginnings Medem spins and weaves a tale that takes the two through adolescence, through togetherness and separation, and eventually leads them to the north pole and back to the film's very first scene, a poetic, fluttering image of a newspaper flying through the air. </p> <p>Like Medem's earlier efforts, Vacas, The Red Squirrel and Tierra, the structure and the feel of his new film are baroque, sometimes wilfully confusing, sometimes frustrating but always beguiling. If there is a tendency to overelaborate, the director-writer's enthusiasm and sympathy for his subject carry the audience through. Does he know where he is going when he writes these stories, or is he as confused as the audience? </p> <p>\"With Lovers, I knew I was going to write a love story, and I knew I was going to alternate the narrator, telling it from his and from her perspective,\" he says. \"Then an image came into my head, the image of the race between the two children, and I thought, ah, here's something that interests me. But I didn't know where I was going. The race was like an escape, a sort of flight, with these two characters escaping one reality for another. I wrote it without wanting to know about the next scene, I wanted to sustain the uncertainty about where I was going.\" </p> <p>Characters like to run in Medem's films; or Medem likes to make his characters run. In among the motorcycle madness of The Red Squirrel - his most successful feature to date, at least in export terms - the most memorable scene has the two male protagonists racing each other to catch up with the disappearing Emma Suarez. Breathless and straining, the two are suspended by Medem's camera in a study of Basque machismo. Machismo, too, is one of his recurrent themes: Vacas (Cows), his debut feature, was a tale of rugged, broad-shouldered Basque men competing to see who could chop tree trunks most swiftly. In Tierra, his third feature, another Basque man - in fact, the same actor from the first two films - wages a lonely struggle to impose order on an unruly, pest-ridden countryside, another allegorical test for the Basque machismo. </p> <p>Yet the very theme that has provided the 40-year-old Medem with much of his inspiration - the Basque condition - is also a source of irritation. Consequently, his new film is set in Madrid, his home for the past three years. \"It hurts me to have left the Basque country, but I think I have gained something. Leftwing nationalism is fascistic. They tell you how you have to be to be a true Basque, how you should feel. The nationalist press exaggerates and promotes difference, but everybody should have the right to behave as they feel.\" The director then embarks on a lengthy, rambling discourse: the Basques are proud, closed, fearful, noble, strong, sober, competitive... before stopping himself with a meek word of apology. </p> <p>But if he is embarrassed in person, on film Medem does not curtail his enthusiasms, entwining the particulars of his personal history with grander, more abstract propositions. In person his intellectualism is not so prominently on display. While he has a Paul Austerish air about him - dark, delicate good looks, a flash to the eyes - he shies away from overt exposition of any credo, preferring to view his films as fragments of autobiography. </p> <p>Tierra was addressed to his father, a Franco supporter, whom the young Medem \"blamed personally for all the disasters in the world\". Lovers of the Arctic Circle tells, in part, the story of his father's brother, Otto - played as a young boy by Medem's own son - a pilot who joined Franco's contribution to the Nazi cause, the Blue Squadron, a volunteer force that helped Hitler bombard Russia in the second world war. </p> <p>\"I think that every film I make is different, and then when it's done it turns out not to be so. But I'm not control mad. I collaborate, I prefer a loss of control to an excess of respect.\" </p> <p>Would he like to do this for ever? \"I wrote a novel when I was young, being an adolescent, I suppose. And some poetry as well. But I don't write much. I hadn't written for two years until this latest script. But I suppose I would like to keep doing this. At least there's nothing routine about it. Maybe I'll just do less of it.\" </p> <p>For now, Medem wallows in critical acclaim - the New York Times accorded Lovers the honour of a front-page review - and wonders about the audience.

      "bodyText": "Julio Medem is excited. No, let's be honest about this: Julio Medem is hugely excited. In London for a day to talk about his latest, fourth feature film, The Lovers of the Arctic Circle, the soft-spoken Basque director can talk about nothing more than his fifth film, as yet untitled, which he had finished writing the night before. \"I have a sty,\" he says, pointing to a red mark on his lower eyelid. \"I was staring for so long at my computer screen - and the protective filter is broken - that it gave me a sty.\" The Lovers of the Arctic Circle takes Medem's usual preoccupations - love, death, nature, accident - and wraps them up in a typically convoluted, magical-realist tract. We meet the lovers in question, the palindromically challenged Ana and Otto, as they race each other through the woods. But at this stage, aged eight or so, they do not yet know that they are to be lovers. They are merely running, against each other and with each other, the boy chasing a football, the girl running away from her mother. From such simple schoolyard beginnings Medem spins and weaves a tale that takes the two through adolescence, through togetherness and separation, and eventually leads them to the north pole and back to the film's very first scene, a poetic, fluttering image of a newspaper flying through the air. Like Medem's earlier efforts, Vacas, The Red Squirrel and Tierra, the structure and the feel of his new film are baroque, sometimes wilfully confusing, sometimes frustrating but always beguiling. If there is a tendency to overelaborate, the director-writer's enthusiasm and sympathy for his subject carry the audience through. Does he know where he is going when he writes these stories, or is he as confused as the audience? \"With Lovers, I knew I was going to write a love story, and I knew I was going to alternate the narrator, telling it from his and from her perspective,\" he says. \"Then an image came into my head, the image of the race between the two children, and I thought, ah, here's something that interests me. But I didn't know where I was going. The race was like an escape, a sort of flight, with these two characters escaping one reality for another. I wrote it without wanting to know about the next scene, I wanted to sustain the uncertainty about where I was going.\" Characters like to run in Medem's films; or Medem likes to make his characters run. In among the motorcycle madness of The Red Squirrel - his most successful feature to date, at least in export terms - the most memorable scene has the two male protagonists racing each other to catch up with the disappearing Emma Suarez. Breathless and straining, the two are suspended by Medem's camera in a study of Basque machismo. Machismo, too, is one of his recurrent themes: Vacas (Cows), his debut feature, was a tale of rugged, broad-shouldered Basque men competing to see who could chop tree trunks most swiftly. In Tierra, his third feature, another Basque man - in fact, the same actor from the first two films - wages a lonely struggle to impose order on an unruly, pest-ridden countryside, another allegorical test for the Basque machismo. Yet the very theme that has provided the 40-year-old Medem with much of his inspiration - the Basque condition - is also a source of irritation. Consequently, his new film is set in Madrid, his home for the past three years. \"It hurts me to have left the Basque country, but I think I have gained something. Leftwing nationalism is fascistic. They tell you how you have to be to be a true Basque, how you should feel. The nationalist press exaggerates and promotes difference, but everybody should have the right to behave as they feel.\" The director then embarks on a lengthy, rambling discourse: the Basques are proud, closed, fearful, noble, strong, sober, competitive... before stopping himself with a meek word of apology. But if he is embarrassed in person, on film Medem does not curtail his enthusiasms, entwining the particulars of his personal history with grander, more abstract propositions. In person his intellectualism is not so prominently on display. While he has a Paul Austerish air about him - dark, delicate good looks, a flash to the eyes - he shies away from overt exposition of any credo, preferring to view his films as fragments of autobiography. Tierra was addressed to his father, a Franco supporter, whom the young Medem \"blamed personally for all the disasters in the world\". Lovers of the Arctic Circle tells, in part, the story of his father's brother, Otto - played as a young boy by Medem's own son - a pilot who joined Franco's contribution to the Nazi cause, the Blue Squadron, a volunteer force that helped Hitler bombard Russia in the second world war. \"I think that every film I make is different, and then when it's done it turns out not to be so. But I'm not control mad. I collaborate, I prefer a loss of control to an excess of respect.\" Would he like to do this for ever? \"I wrote a novel when I was young, being an adolescent, I suppose. And some poetry as well. But I don't write much. I hadn't written for two years until this latest script. But I suppose I would like to keep doing this. At least there's nothing routine about it. Maybe I'll just do less of it.\" For now, Medem wallows in critical acclaim - the New York Times accorded Lovers the honour of a front-page review - and wonders about the audience. While at home each new film has won him a greater share of the box office, abroad his fortunes have been mixed. Everyone everywhere loved The Red Squirrel, but Tierra has fared less well, and was barely released in this country. Lovers too disappointed in France and Germany, and only appears here some two years after it was screened at Cannes. But there's always Hollywood. He's frequently offered directing gigs in the US, and an English-language remake of The Red Squirrel has been optioned. \"Apparently there's a script, but I don't really know.

      "body": "<p>It is hard to be triumphalist about a non-event, and the people responsible for busting the so-called Y2K bug didn't manage it. \"Hey, nothing happened. Wasn't that wonderful?\" While a gunpowder trail of exploding fireworks snaked across the globe, computer dates turned from 99 to 00 and country after country reported no serious effects. Planes failed to fall out of the sky. Civilisation did not sink. There were a few hiccups, but no date-related heart attacks - at least, not of the computer kind. </p> <p>Even the four countries considered most at risk and therefore the subject of Y2K-related travel warnings from the US state department (Belarus, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine), failed to report any disasters. Their nuclear reactors kept on working. </p> <p>John Koskinen, chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year 2000 Conversion said of his organisation's global tracking: \"At this point we are not aware of anything that is broken as a result of Y2K.\" Bruce McConnell, director of the International Year 2000 Cooperation Center (IY2KCC), concurred: \"From an infrastructure standpoint, we expect a continuation of the non-event.\" The UN-backed organisation tracked progress on its website at <a href=\"http://www.iy2kcc.org\">www.iy2kcc.org</a>. Tom Olsen, principal investigator for Y2K at a leading commercial research organisation, International Data Corporation (IDC) in Massachusetts, went to Copenhagen to monitor turn-of-the-year events in Europe. \"It went better than I'd predicted,\" he said yesterday, \"and I was the low predictor. Some of my competitors were predicting Chicken Little: The sky fell on me!\" </p> <p>The inevitable question is whether the $200bn to $600bn spent tackling the date change problem world-wide had been wasted. Was the bug hype overdone? Not according to the experts. Peter de Jager, the Canadian who did more than anyone to get the Y2K bandwagon rolling with an article called Doomsday 2000 published in September 1993, reckons not. </p> <p>\"The truth of the matter is this. All the hype, including some of the more ludicrous statements, forced companies to do one thing and one thing only. It forced competent managers round the globe to examine their systems with the single-minded goal of answering a simple question: did this thing called Y2K pose a threat to their computer systems? \"If the answer was yes, then they took appropriate action. If the answer was no, then they rightfully ignored it.\" </p> <p>In other words, companies and governments didn't spend money fixing a problem that didn't exist.

      "bodyText": "It is hard to be triumphalist about a non-event, and the people responsible for busting the so-called Y2K bug didn't manage it. \"Hey, nothing happened. Wasn't that wonderful?\" While a gunpowder trail of exploding fireworks snaked across the globe, computer dates turned from 99 to 00 and country after country reported no serious effects. Planes failed to fall out of the sky. Civilisation did not sink. There were a few hiccups, but no date-related heart attacks - at least, not of the computer kind. Even the four countries considered most at risk and therefore the subject of Y2K-related travel warnings from the US state department (Belarus, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine), failed to report any disasters. Their nuclear reactors kept on working. John Koskinen, chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year 2000 Conversion said of his organisation's global tracking: \"At this point we are not aware of anything that is broken as a result of Y2K.\" Bruce McConnell, director of the International Year 2000 Cooperation Center (IY2KCC), concurred: \"From an infrastructure standpoint, we expect a continuation of the non-event.\" The UN-backed organisation tracked progress on its website at www.iy2kcc.org. Tom Olsen, principal investigator for Y2K at a leading commercial research organisation, International Data Corporation (IDC) in Massachusetts, went to Copenhagen to monitor turn-of-the-year events in Europe. \"It went better than I'd predicted,\" he said yesterday, \"and I was the low predictor. Some of my competitors were predicting Chicken Little: The sky fell on me!\" The inevitable question is whether the $200bn to $600bn spent tackling the date change problem world-wide had been wasted. Was the bug hype overdone? Not according to the experts. Peter de Jager, the Canadian who did more than anyone to get the Y2K bandwagon rolling with an article called Doomsday 2000 published in September 1993, reckons not. \"The truth of the matter is this. All the hype, including some of the more ludicrous statements, forced companies to do one thing and one thing only. It forced competent managers round the globe to examine their systems with the single-minded goal of answering a simple question: did this thing called Y2K pose a threat to their computer systems? \"If the answer was yes, then they took appropriate action. If the answer was no, then they rightfully ignored it.\" In other words, companies and governments didn't spend money fixing a problem that didn't exist. The fact that the sky didn't fall on you doesn't mean there was no Y2K problem, but that serious problems have been averted. So far. Whatever the result, the cost of fixing the Y2K bug has been frightening, even for an industry with a global turnover of about $1 trillion a year.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, are to squeeze in a quick new year holiday without their children to help Mrs Blair get over the \"tiredness\" of a fourth pregnancy at 45. But they have not been wholly able to escape prime minister's workload - the couple will stay at the British embassy so that Mr Blair can stay in direct charge of the government. He will also spend at least one day in talks with his Portuguese counterpart, Antonio Guterres, about the special European Union summit on enterprise and reform which will be held in Lisbon in March. Downing Street announced yesterday that the Blairs had slipped quietly out of Heathrow on Monday to spend most of this week resting in Portugal before returning at the weekend. Their other children, Euan, 15, Nicky, 14 and Kathryn, 12, at home in Downing Street in the care of their maternal grandmother. Their new school term begins today. Mindful of missed schooldays because of last year's family winter holiday in the Seychelles, officials were also quick to head off puritanical denunciations of the prime ministerial holiday rota. The holiday is likely to be a welcome break and is almost certainly the Blairs last free time together before their fourth child is born in May. Witnesses reported that Mrs Blair had flu and was tired to the point of tears during the part of the millennium ceremonies on the Thames last Friday. Mr Blair admitted as much in a Woman's Own interview published yesterday. \"She's a bit tired at the moment,\" he said. \"She's normally got bags of energy. In fact she still does an awful lot, probably too much at the moment. Yes, she is, she's fine - but tired.\" He also revealed how much news of the pregnancy had surprised him. \"I really did fall off my chair at first,\" he said. \"I honestly was delighted but shocked at the same time, really shellshocked. But now I'm getting used to it, I'm really looking forward to it now.\" Downing Street officials yesterday emphasised that Mr Blair would be keeping in constant touch with day to day events in Britain thanks to his host, British ambassador, John Holmes. Mr Holmes, a former principal private secretary in the Downing Street office who played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process, is a personal friend. \"Staying at the residence means the prime minister has access to secure communications and all the rest and can keep in touch,\" Mr Blair's spokesman said. That did not stop John Redwood, the Tory environment spokesman, from detecting what he called \"another vote of no confidence in John Prescott\". Mr Redwood, who rarely takes a holiday, added: \"He is sidelined with the prime minister on holiday. He must be feeling his neck very gingerly at the moment.\" Downing Street called that \"silly\", stressing that Mr Prescott remained at his desk in the department of the environment, transport and the regions and that Mr Blair was keen to sharpen up the agenda for the special EU summit.",

      "bodyText": "Most of what you say about the first night in the Dome (Leader, January 3) seems all too painfully true, but to refer in such disparaging tones to \"a theatre composer called Jonathan Dove\" merely betrays ignorance. Certainly he is a composer who has written a great deal for the theatre, but he is also the composer of, among many other things, one of the few successful full-scale operas to have been produced professionally in this country in the last decade (Flight, commissioned and presented by Glyndebourne 1998 and revived in 1999). To imply he does not bear comparison with Peter Maxwell Davies is rude and wrong. Genista McIntosh London According to your leader, there has been no feminine contribution to British culture for the past 1,000 years worth the mention. You appear to be entering the new century with the patriarchal attitudes of the last but one. Women literary geniuses such as Jane Austen, George Eliot, Emily and Charlotte Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell, to name only the novelists, struggled for and won the right to have their voices heard in the 19th century. Carrie Johnson Coldharbour, Surrey carrie@anstie.waitrose.com Leave Jools Holland alone! My life has been made so much better for having heard Jools live on many occasions and bopping 'til I drop. Helene Perrin-Summers Nailsworth, Glos Lord Falconer's apology for the Dome ticket fiasco is hopelessly inadequate (Report, Janaury 3). Doesn't he realise the VIPs who had to queue with \"ordinary\" people included some newspaper editors?

The scandal overshadowed talks between Syria and Israel on the future of the Golan Heights and news that negotiators had finally agreed on an Israeli withdrawal from a further 5% of the West Bank - a move caught up for seven weeks in a dispute with Palestinian officials over maps. The pullout - which had been due in November - will give Palestinians full or partial control of the area within 48 hours of a handover ceremony in Jerusalem.

It held out the prospect of similar increases each year to the end of 2004 - which would mean a total of 500 new pubs, employing 15,000 full and part-time workers in managment, bar work and catering. \"Most people come in for something to drink or to eat,\" a company spokesman, Eddie Gershon, said. \"They don't want to find a disco or quiz night breaking out.\" The cheap beer, \"just a pub\" philosophy has seen Wetherspoon grow from 44 pubs when it floated on the stock exchange in 1992 to its present 372. It already employs more than 10,000 people, a far cry from 1979 when the chairman, Tim Martin, bought a pub in a converted betting shop in Muswell Hill, north London, from a friend. The company's earlier megapub, no frills approach, risked accusations of lacking atmosphere in their cavernous surroundings - perhaps inevitable when the bars were established in former supermarkets, showrooms or post offices. It still opens big pubs - its new 9,000 square feet operation in Plymouth employs 95 staff - but its more recent interest in old churches, banks and other prime town centre sites is also gaining it a reputation for sensitive conversions. Wetherspoon rarely uses former pubs. \"If they are good, people are not going to be getting rid of them,\" said Mr Gershon. \"We are not like McDonald's, all exactly the same. We are not like theme pubs. If you are going to go to the pub, for two hours, it would be silly to have one exactly the same as the one down the road.\" Among buildings due to open this year are former banks in Airdrie and Stevenage, a former leisure centre in Arbroath, a former garage in Hull and a disused nightclub in Nottingham. Other towns to get a Wetherspoon presence will be Worthing, Godalming, Buxton, Poole and Stourport-on-Severn. Appropriately for a company using old banks, it is now experimenting with cash machines in some pubs. The Campaign for Real Ale said: \"We welcome what Wetherspoon do. They are becoming quite innovative in design, lighting, use of glass, seating and so on. They are certainly moving in the right direction and providing a good range of beers for a wider audience.\" \u0095 The Yates Brothers Wine Lodges company has announced plans to add 31 new outlets, creating 1,200 new jobs, to its 110-strong chain.

      "bodyText": "The discovery of a unique collection of thousands of old medical records at Dundee university has prompted one of the largest studies of foetal development and links to adult illnesses. The hand-written and detailed records of more than 50,000 births in Tayside were kept by the late professor of obstetrics, James Walker. Unlike his contemporaries, Walker recorded a wealth of information about the mothers and babies under his care between 1952 and 1966, including the mother's height, eating habits and blood pressure, the length of the pregnancy, the head circumference and length of the baby, and whether the infant was breast or bottle fed. The material, kept in cardboard boxes in the university for years, has given a team of researchers an opportunity to study how adult illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease might be activated in the womb. The team plans to computerise the records and then track the babies, now in their 30s and 40s, through a series of medical databases to see how they have fared. They also hope to study the link between breast and bottle feeding and later health. And, because many of the infants are now themselves parents, they will look at possible intergeneration effects. Stewart Forsyth, a consultant paediatrician at Ninewells hospital and one of the research team, said: \"We knew these records were around.

      "bodyText": "Government is wasting billions of pounds on ineffective and useless information technology systems, a committee of MPs says in a report published today. The government is spending some \u00a37bn a year on new systems, and the Commons public accounts committee draws together a decade of blunders - from the national insurance contributions system to the debacle at the passport agency, which disrupted tens of thousands of applications. David Davis, Tory chairman of the committee, said yesterday: \"Such projects are too often delivered late or not at all; they come in over budget or fail to work as intended at the outset. \"The consequence of such poor performance is that the citizen loses out. Basic errors are repeated time and again, but lessons do not seem to have been learned.\" The MPs warn that unless the situation is resolved quickly, it will jeopardise Tony Blair's ambitious plans to put 25% of government business on line by 2002. The report highlights 25 projects which have failed to deliver the promised improvements to the public and in some cases had to be abandoned because they did not work properly. One of the worst ministries was the home office which is condemned for making a mess of a new system to deliver passports; for signing an unenforceable contract over processing nationality and immigration claims and for introducing a computer system that actually delayed payments for people handing in guns after the Dunblane massacre. The home office blunders led to the cost of processing passports increasing from \u00a312 to \u00a315.50. A new passport now costs \u00a328. The section on the home office's failings concludes: \"It is essential that departments learn from their past mistakes and consider how they can co-ordinate better their considerable resources to ensure better value for money from IT development.\" Other departments heavily criticised include the NHS executive, the ministry of defence and the contributions agency. The NHS was attacked for years of errors in co-ordinating information on hospital patients and failing to co-ordinate a system so different hospitals could share the information. The ministry of defence had to abandon a top secret computer system never used at a cost of \u00a340m and spent millions of pounds on a faulty computer system to handle the sale of surplus equipment. The benefits agency and the contributions agency are attacked for trying to implement computer systems that were not capable of doing the job. The contributions agency has still not sorted out a new system to record national insurance payments with the result that people are still not being paid. The failure in the national insurance recording system meant 172,000 pensioners were underpaid by between one penny to \u00a3100 a week because their contributions had not been collated. The benefits agency spent millions on a benefit card system which was never introduced and is now considered out of date. The report calls for widespread changes in the way computer contracts are handled, ensuring that departments employed skilled project managers to run them properly.",

      "body": "<p>Viewers in Ireland won't be able to watch Bomber, a two-part drama that begins tonight on ITV. The channel's schedulers have deemed the title too sensitive for people both north and south of the border, even though the programme, about the army's bomb-disposal officers, barely mentions Ulster. Bomber is an intricate, brooding, psychological whodunit, starring Mark Strong from Births, Marriages And Deaths and Andrew Lincoln from This Life. The only politics in it are sexual ones, and the person who sets the explosives is motivated by a personal grudge, not a terrorist cause. </p> <p>Still, even if not everyone in the British Isles will be allowed to see Bomber, the very fact that it has been made is a sign of the times. If there were still a reasonable chance of a real bomb going off the night before transmission, the mini-series would have never got beyond the basic idea. (In this case, oddly enough, the basic idea came from Leslie \"Dirty Den\" Grantham.) Bomber's writer, Rob Heyland, agrees that in the climate of just a few years ago the drama would have been impossible. \"I don't think I would have had access to the EOD [Explosive Ordinance Disposal] people for a start\", he says. \"They were incredibly sweet and accommodating and quite amused by the idea of a tubby idiot coming in and saying, 'I'm going to write a story about you.' I spent a lot of time with them, I watched them training and I got all sorts of information that, previously, you would have had to be John Pilger to get access to.\" </p> <p>Heyland, who also created Between The Lines, adds that not every insight into the life of a bomb-disposal officer was very helpful. \"They're fantastically professional\", he says. \"They have their routines and procedures, and they're amazingly dry and phlegmatic. A realistic evocation of their daily lives wouldn't have any drama in it at all.\" </p> <p>For their part, the Royal Logistic Corps, from which EOD officers are drawn, could hardly be expected to enjoy the results of their co-operation. Bomber is a sympathetic, unsensationalist portrayal of decent people doing a dangerous job, but it's hardly an army recruitment film. Half the time the EOD officers have no clue that a bomb exists until it detonates, and when they do locate an unexploded device, they are shown either failing to defuse it, or defusing it more by luck than judgment. One scene has two soldiers crouching over the same bomb, each convinced that a different wire should be cut. Over the course of the drama, three soldiers are blown to pieces. Another old soldier has had his hearing damaged by a blast. And, by the way, military men are crap at relationships with their wives and families, too. </p> <p>All the same, Heyland insists, most of the soldiers who have seen Bomber were impressed. \"There were tremendous divides between officers and men, as there always are\", he says. \"The lads were quite pleased by the way the Ruperts [derogatory term for junior officers] were shown to be very fallible and quite infantile when it came to partying. The officers thought it was very interesting, but weren't terribly flattered. And two officers who aren't in the Logistics Corps any more said it was awesomely authentic, which was the most pleasing reaction of all. They were jumping with laughter and shouting, 'I served with him!' and 'That's how my mate got killed!'\" </p> <p>Apart from the improved climate, there is a less positive reason why Bomber was so much more feasible a project than it might have been in the past: it's now a lot easier to make bombs. Indeed, in tomorrow's episode, levelling a house appears to be a straightforward, Blue Peter-style matter of arranging a clothes peg, a battery, a light switch and some string in a Tupperware box. But again Heyland has the research to back the story up. </p> <p>\"I did wonder when I started writing it - am I going to create trouble? Am I going to provoke people to do things?\" he says. \"Then my nephew told me that it was easy to get books on how to make bombs sent from America. You shouldn't be able to, but you order them on the net, and customs officers don't check books. And I've got a whole box-file of stuff printed directly off the net. One's titled, The Best Non-Nuclear Explosive Available To The Modern Terrorist, and there's a two-page recipe of how to cook it.\" </p> <p>A few minutes of conversation like this and you find yourself wondering if it's such a terrible thing that some viewers aren't getting to see Bomber. Perhaps we should be watching television that doesn't have any suggestion of violence or terrorism at all. In Ireland tonight, ITV has scheduled Die Hard With A Vengeance.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The men in grey suits are rumbling. When William Hague returns from his skiing holiday in Montana, he can expect a frosty reception from Tory grandees who fear their young leader has become a dangerous liability. The former deputy prime minister, Geoffrey Howe, yesterday became the latest in a series of Tory elder statesmen to warn Mr Hague that he is in danger of destroying the party unless he returns to the centre ground. Lord Howe, the famously lampooned \"dead sheep\" who briefly came alive to wound Margaret Thatcher in his devastating 1990 resignation speech, said with uncharacteristic bluntness that the Tories were not \"widely regarded as a credible alternative government\". The monetarist former chancellor, who fell foul of Thatcher because of his love of Europe and his plodding manner, rounded on Mr Hague for his foolishness in dispensing with the services of his deputy, Peter Lilley, and his leader in the Lords, Viscount Cranborne. \"By these standards even Sir Keith Joseph might have been lucky to survive,\" Lord Howe said in a reference to the free thinking rightwinger who laid the basis for Thatcherism during the Tories' last spell in opposition. For a time after victory in the Falklands, Lady Thatcher's power had become almost literally magnetic, Lord Howe said. But later, ministers were spinning off like sparks from a Catherine wheel. \"Mr Hague thus risks finding himself at the Catherine wheel stage, without having enjoyed any magnetic interlude on the way.\" Hagueites, confident that the man who brought down their heroine poses no threat to Mr Hague, dismissed Lord Howe's outburst as his \"annual rant\". However, their bluster masked a growing fear that Lord Howe's intervention is part of an orchestrated fightback by grandees exasperated by the way in which Mr Hague has allowed himself to fall into the hands of the Thatcherites. Last week John Major warned Mr Hague that he would lose votes if he allowed \"the ghost of government past to lead the party by the nose\". The attack from the former prime minister, who had vowed never to criticise his successor, came hard on the heels of a characteristically barbed outburst from Kenneth Clarke against the \"way-out young ideologues\" surrounding Mr Hague. Fears at Central Office that the grandees are plotting against Mr Hague were fuelled when the former minister David Curry, who served as Mr Clarke's campaign manager in his 1997 leadership bid, said that Mr Major had tipped him off about his intervention. \"John told me he had written [his] piece, so I have been waiting for this Exocet to go off,\" Mr Curry said of Mr Major's piece, published in the Spectator. Although heads have been put together, it is too early to talk of a plot among the likes of Mr Major, Mr Clarke and Lord Howe. A few rungs down on the grandee ladder, however, there is growing cooperation among former ministers who fear that Mr Hague is in danger of blow ing away what little support the Tories still retain. The pro-European former environment secretary, John Gummer, and the Eurosceptic former education secretary, Gillian Shephard, are just a few of the senior Tories who believe that Mr Hague is lurching too far away from the party's mainstream supporters. There is talk of a senior deputation from the \"men in grey suits\" - with Mrs Shephard on board they may have to be re named the \"people in grey suits\" - calling on Mr Hague when the Commons returns next week. A little-noticed new year's message from the pro-European MP Peter Luff gives a flavour of the growing dismay among centre-ground Tories. Mr Luff, a former aide to Ted Heath but one who has gone out of his way to be loyal to Mr Hague, said that Mr Major and Mr Clarke were right to say that the party had given the appearance of moving to the right. \"Our party does have a problem. Perception is reality [which means] it's what people think about you that really matters. \"Our policies are not wrong, but their presentation is unbalanced. This lop-sided presentation gives credence to the allegations that we are becoming extreme.\" Inexperienced Hagueites are likely to make the mistake of dismissing interventions from the Luffs and the Clarkes as embittered outbursts. However, the young Turks would do well to listen to Lord Howe who quoted the late Angus Maude - father of the shadow chancellor - who said that newcomers should listen to their seniors even if they have been on the losing side. 'Not a credible alternative' \"Today's Conservative party - to put it gently - is not widely regarded as a credible alternative. William Hague lost both his leader in the Lords and his own deputy. By these standards, even Sir Keith Joseph would have been lucky to survive.\" Lord Howe of Aberavon \"There are no votes in yesterday and many to be lost if the Ghost of Government Past appears to lead the party by the nose. The harking back to the 1980s at the party conference may have appealed to the activists, but was a real turn-off to the undecided voter. Rallies for Pinochet were not a good idea. They distracted from the new agenda William set, and in any event, Pinochet's alleged misdeeds are for the courts, not the politicians.\" John Major \"I fear the party has moved very strongly to the right. The great danger for the Conservative party is to make sure that it does not imitate the Labour party after 1979 when it lurched far too far to the left and made itself unelectable.\" Kenneth Clarke \"It is natural for parties to want to regress to what they regard as their heartlands.

A friend and I have just been discussing TV: A Question Of Pop - neither of us has seen it but I do dislike Theakston quite strongly. It's always the same mindless presenters on television. I watched Forgive And Forget, which was hyped incredibly and I thought it was nothing really, not controversial at all. ITV are doing a lot of these one-off dramas, whereas the BBC doesn't anymore which I find peculiar. It's a reversal.\" </p> <p><strong> Siobhan Donnelly, assistant producer, Big Breakfast:</strong> \"I watch the Big Breakfast, not every day, but I do see most shows. I used to watch TFI Friday but I don't now, I think it's gone downhill. </p> <p>Sunday night is the only night I'm in and I was hooked on Wives And Daughters - I loved that. I didn't like Oliver Twist, though. Streetmate was great, people making fools of themselves; that possibility of romance - then the couple never see each other again. I'm proud to say I've never watched Coronation Street - I caught a glimpse but I've never watched a whole episode. What do I switch off? Most stuff. There's no programme that I wouldn't miss.\" </p> <p><strong> James Peak, BBC Research Department:</strong> \"I'm a big fan of the BBC Natural History Unit - the effort they go to is incredible. I really enjoyed the time-lapse film over Christmas. From a production point of view, it would have been amazing to work on, to get your teeth into. </p> <p>One of the best programmes was also Living With The Enemy - so simple but so effective. There was more drama in that than on most drama series. The Cambridge oik who went to live with the pro-cannabis community - it really showed him to be arrogant, snide little fool. What I don't like is too many \"pets and vets\" and that sort of thing. I don't have a garden and I don't have a pet, so a lot of scheduling is not for me.\" </p>",

      "bodyText": "Huda Ali, freelance producer: \"I watch late-night TV mostly, 4 Later because it's really weird and surreal, and it's also the time I get back from work, and daytime TV is pants - I make it and I know. I am obsessed with TV. A friend and I have just been discussing TV: A Question Of Pop - neither of us has seen it but I do dislike Theakston quite strongly. It's always the same mindless presenters on television. I watched Forgive And Forget, which was hyped incredibly and I thought it was nothing really, not controversial at all. ITV are doing a lot of these one-off dramas, whereas the BBC doesn't anymore which I find peculiar. It's a reversal.\" Siobhan Donnelly, assistant producer, Big Breakfast: \"I watch the Big Breakfast, not every day, but I do see most shows. I used to watch TFI Friday but I don't now, I think it's gone downhill. Sunday night is the only night I'm in and I was hooked on Wives And Daughters - I loved that. I didn't like Oliver Twist, though. Streetmate was great, people making fools of themselves; that possibility of romance - then the couple never see each other again. I'm proud to say I've never watched Coronation Street - I caught a glimpse but I've never watched a whole episode. What do I switch off? Most stuff. There's no programme that I wouldn't miss.\" James Peak, BBC Research Department: \"I'm a big fan of the BBC Natural History Unit - the effort they go to is incredible. I really enjoyed the time-lapse film over Christmas. From a production point of view, it would have been amazing to work on, to get your teeth into. One of the best programmes was also Living With The Enemy - so simple but so effective. There was more drama in that than on most drama series. The Cambridge oik who went to live with the pro-cannabis community - it really showed him to be arrogant, snide little fool. What I don't like is too many \"pets and vets\" and that sort of thing. I don't have a garden and I don't have a pet, so a lot of scheduling is not for me.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone and Glenda Jackson will today receive copies of Labour's London membership list after a three-month battle to get access to the 70,000 names and addresses. The party hierarchy hopes the move will end a damaging internal row over how their rival for Labour's nomination for London's mayor, Frank Dobson, obtained details last October to send out letters seeking support. The Euro MP Richard Balfe, who admitted securing the list for Mr Dobson, is to make copies available to the former health secretary's opponents. Mr Livingstone and Ms Jackson complained that they had been put at a disadvantage by being prevented from mailing members who make up one third of the party's electoral college. The pair will now come under pressure to drop complaints against Mr Dobson's campaign, but the data protection registrar could press ahead with an investigation. The Dobson team is accused of not having a licence to possess the names, and of obtaining them unfairly. Mr Dobson put pressure on Labour's Millbank HQ to make the names available to his rivals after realising the row was damaging his campaign. Senior party figures had previously claimed a copy could not be handed over to Mr Livingstone because he was backed by far left groups who might misuse it. Mr Livingstone, the former leader of the old Greater London council, accused his critics of smear tactics. He said that his surveys showed he was on course for victory next month. A supporter of Mr Dobson, Tony Blair's favoured candidate, said: \"Hopefully this will draw a line under the controversy over membership lists. \"What counts is who will be the best mayor, and Ken and Glenda have got away scrutiny-free so far.\"",

This Indian woman from a Sikh family in Kuala Lumpur working (as a rare south Asian) in a British law office in Hong Kong, and married to an Englishman, was a figure of outstanding promise, suddenly cut short. Eastern and western politics framed her life. In 1959, her father Karam Singh became the youngest MP in the first parliament of independent Malaysia, sitting for the Socialist Party. Shortly after Veriah's birth he was held in detention for four years for organising a militant march of rubber plantation workers. Since 1994 she had been linked with a man of equally patent leftwing background, Marxism Today's Martin Jacques: they married in 1996. A daughter of the generation that won freedom, she remained non-political, straddling and combining her worlds: proudly Malaysian, and multilingual, except in the ancestral Punjabi - the family spoke English. Though she had practised law in Kuala Lumpur, it was brave to do so as an Asian woman in London on the strength of an external London LLB, even when supplemented in Britain by study for an LLM. Perhaps it was an appreciation of her achievement, as well as her quiet but confident mind, which impressed the City firm of Lovell's enough to take her on, first in London and, since 1998, in Hong Kong.

She awoke, aged 42, on the brink of the 21st century.</p> <p>Her first words were: \"Don't do that\" to a group of astonished nurses who were going through the daily routine of fixing her bed at a residential home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her mother, Snowflake Flower, was summoned, and declared it a Christmas miracle. Indeed her daughter's first words to her were reported to be \"Merry Christmas\".</p> <p>The doctors were equally dumbfounded by the sudden recovery. \"I've never seen anything like this,\" said Elliot Marcus, a specialist in long-term care at the Las Palomas nursing and rehabilitation centre. \"I can't come up with a medical explanation.\"</p> <p>No one is quite sure what, if anything, Ms White Bull, was thinking during her long vegetative interlude. She is still struggling to relearn a basic vocabulary, which should eventually allow her to describe her experience. Her hands are just beginning to loosen after being clenched in a 16-year fist.</p> <p>Her children, who had been told that their mother would never wake up, rushed to her bedside. \"I just went up to her and gave her a hug and she gave me a hug back,\" said Cindi, her oldest daughter. \"It was the first time she had ever hugged back. It was scary at first.\"</p> <p>Once she could walk with the aid of a stick, Ms White Bull's first request was to head to the nearest shopping mall, where she had a slice of pizza. Later, she was driven up into the New Mexico mountains to breathe the mountain air. Pointing to a new pair of training shoes, she told journalists: \"I'm going to run.\"</p> <p>Ms White Bull's case is a boon to opponents of euthanasia, who argue that the human body has extraordinary powers of recovery and should be kept alive at all costs. According to Dr Marcus, the 26-year-old Sioux woman originally fell into her semi-vegetative state after complications during a caesarean section. A blood clot lodged in her lung and she stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating. She was resuscitated but suffered brain damage from lack of oxygen.</p> <p>After that she lay in bed being fed through a tube into her stomach and drained through a catheter, but she was not in a total coma. Her eyes stayed open, and would occasionally move. Ms White Bull sometimes crossed her legs or moved her arms, but she showed no significant response to pain and she never communicated.</p> <p>However, Dr Marcus warned that Ms White Bull's hold on consciousness could be temporary - she could remain at her current level of functioning, she could improve or she could fall back into the semi-vegetative state.</p> <p>Her former husband, Mark, stayed in Albuquerque for three years after she entered the catatonic state, but then moved with their children to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in South Dakota, where he took a job in the tribal government. \"I grew to accept that nothing was going to change,\" he said.</p> <p>He filed for divorce, but when asked this week whether the couple had a future, he replied: \"If she recovers and she wants to re-establish a relationship with me, I'm here.\"</p>",

She awoke, aged 42, on the brink of the 21st century. Her first words were: \"Don't do that\" to a group of astonished nurses who were going through the daily routine of fixing her bed at a residential home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her mother, Snowflake Flower, was summoned, and declared it a Christmas miracle. Indeed her daughter's first words to her were reported to be \"Merry Christmas\". The doctors were equally dumbfounded by the sudden recovery. \"I've never seen anything like this,\" said Elliot Marcus, a specialist in long-term care at the Las Palomas nursing and rehabilitation centre. \"I can't come up with a medical explanation.\" No one is quite sure what, if anything, Ms White Bull, was thinking during her long vegetative interlude. She is still struggling to relearn a basic vocabulary, which should eventually allow her to describe her experience. Her hands are just beginning to loosen after being clenched in a 16-year fist. Her children, who had been told that their mother would never wake up, rushed to her bedside. \"I just went up to her and gave her a hug and she gave me a hug back,\" said Cindi, her oldest daughter. \"It was the first time she had ever hugged back. It was scary at first.\" Once she could walk with the aid of a stick, Ms White Bull's first request was to head to the nearest shopping mall, where she had a slice of pizza. Later, she was driven up into the New Mexico mountains to breathe the mountain air. Pointing to a new pair of training shoes, she told journalists: \"I'm going to run.\" Ms White Bull's case is a boon to opponents of euthanasia, who argue that the human body has extraordinary powers of recovery and should be kept alive at all costs. According to Dr Marcus, the 26-year-old Sioux woman originally fell into her semi-vegetative state after complications during a caesarean section. A blood clot lodged in her lung and she stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating. She was resuscitated but suffered brain damage from lack of oxygen. After that she lay in bed being fed through a tube into her stomach and drained through a catheter, but she was not in a total coma. Her eyes stayed open, and would occasionally move. Ms White Bull sometimes crossed her legs or moved her arms, but she showed no significant response to pain and she never communicated. However, Dr Marcus warned that Ms White Bull's hold on consciousness could be temporary - she could remain at her current level of functioning, she could improve or she could fall back into the semi-vegetative state. Her former husband, Mark, stayed in Albuquerque for three years after she entered the catatonic state, but then moved with their children to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in South Dakota, where he took a job in the tribal government. \"I grew to accept that nothing was going to change,\" he said. He filed for divorce, but when asked this week whether the couple had a future, he replied: \"If she recovers and she wants to re-establish a relationship with me, I'm here.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Remember a film called Revenge of the Nerds? Thought not. In truth it was not Hollywood's finest moment. Released in 1984, the movie is a sub-Animal House student romp centring on a group of pizza-faced boffins who, fed up with years of bullying at the hands of the jock establishment, wreak allegedly humorous campus havoc by re-programming the college computer. In the process they win over the pneumatic cheer-leading sorority who obligingly remove their bras in admiration.</p> <p>When his feeble effort plunged straight to video, little did the director Peter Samuelson realise that, 16 years later, the movie would provide the perfect commentary on our times. As the last few days have proved, the Nerds have got their revenge: the 21st century belongs to them. Not only do Nerds officially occupy most of the higher positions in the world's rich list, they have now assumed a position of absolute power over all our lives. Young, clever and knowledgable in way which we techno-Luddites cannot imagine, we are terrified of them. We will do anything they tell us, throw any amount of money in their direction, just as long as they keep our computers working.</p> <p>On a local scale, we all fall into the thrall of the Nerd the moment we buy a PC, something we are constantly told we must do if we wish to keep apace with the revolution out there. In some barn on a ring road, a youth with perma-gelled hair fills your head with talk of mega rams and sends you home with a ludicrously expensive machine apparently capable of launching the space shuttle but incapable, you discover the moment you switch it on, of printing a letter.</p> <p>So you call a telephone support operative, sitting in an aircraft hangar somewhere near Dumfries. There is nothing in the world capable of inducing a volcanic loss of temper as quickly as a telephone support operative, especially when they ask if Sir has plugged the computer in yet. As they utter platitudes in that jargon-filled argot designed entirely to make you feel stupid, you splutter: \"But don't your realise my business depends on this?\" And when they respond with a meaningful \"Ah well, if Sir is using the computer for business purposes, Sir should have bought a business machine in the first place,\" you find your mouse has been smashed into a dozen pieces beneath your fist.</p> <p>So you ring a Nerd prepared to come for a house visit, even though his hourly call-out rate matches that of a libel QC. Like a digital garage mechanic or roofing contractor, he sucks through his teeth on his arrival and tells you that you need an extra giga-byte, with hard disk overdrive. And because you haven't a clue what he is talking about, you take his word and pay up, softened by his console-side manner, the technological equivalent of old ladies who make over their entire will to the doctor who speaks kindly to them on their death beds.</p> <p>So it was with the millennium bug. Few of us could quite understand why it was that our microwave would be confused by the change of century into thinking it was preparing M&amp;S chicken madras on January 1 1900, and thus refuse to defrost, but if a Nerd told us that would happen we believed them. Then we paid them whatever they told us was necessary to make sure that come the day, our curry cooked in time. At the BBC, for instance, more than \u00a310m was spent getting the corporation compliant. That's enough to have kept Des Lynam. Well, almost.</p> <p>Encouraged by uber-Nerd John Birt, fighting the bug was given top priority at the Beeb. Distinguished programme-makers found themselves bullied by 23-year-old computer boffins telling them they couldn't do anything until the bug was sorted. I know this because I met the BBC's Y2K supremo just before Christmas. Disarmingly cheerful as the predicted armageddon approached, he had clearly had the time of his life this past year, as anyone would when operating in the joyous knowledge that everyone will do whatever you tell them. After a taste of being in charge he wasn't going to let anything as trivial as the arrival of 2000 see him out of a job.</p> <p>\"There's going to be plenty of follow-up work all through next year,\" he told me.</p> <p>So prevalent was the Nerd agenda at the BBC that, during the marathon television coverage of the millennium, a rumour swept TV Centre as midnight passed in Moscow that the bug had triggered a nuclear assault and the missiles were on their way. For a few moments, panic gripped the studio; everyone was going to die, and all because the Russians couldn't be arsed to ring the government help line.</p> <p>Bizarrely, even though in the end nothing happened, even though poor Peter Snow's Bugometer only twitched briefly in the direction of a tax office in Gabon, the Nerds have still come out of it all smelling of cash and influence. They tell us nothing went wrong, not because there was never any threat in the first place, but because relevant, pricey precautions were taken. This is the really clever bit of the Nerd revenge: since we don't know, we can't gainsay them. And so we yield afresh to the new masters of the universe.</p> <p><b> My part in the C\u00e9zanne heist</b></p> <p>Living a few doors down from Oxford's Ashmolean museum, scene of the New Year's Eve C\u00e9zanne heist, I have been involved for the first time in my life in that great British institution: the house-to-house inquiry. Ever since the robbery, our street has been filled with police, large men in para-military garb with macho displays of hardwear dangling from their belts staring into our cellar and bringing to mind thoughts about stable doors and bolting horses.</p> <p>Yesterday a constable appeared on the doorstep asking if I had been in the neighbourhood on the night of the robbery. People always say that when a policeman knocks on the door, however innocent you might be, a strange panic kicks in which obliges you to provide far more information than is strictly necessary. Now I know it is true. Instead of a simple sorry, I wasn't here, it was after all New Year's Eve, I found myself spewing out details of the party we were at, the location, the guest list, the quality of the fireworks, the fact I'm more of a Monet man myself. I only just stopped short of offering Jeffrey Archer's name as a corroborative witness for an alibi.</p> <p>\"I'd better come in and get all this down,\" said the policeman.</p> <p>And in he came, jovially confiding that this inquiry made a change from the usual \"mundane stuff\".</p> <p>\"Mundane stuff?\" I said.</p> <p>\"Oh you know,\" he said. \"Bottlings, glassings, stabbings, your usual New Year's Eve.\"</p> <p>After 20 minutes he had extracted from me my name, address, age, telephone number and the fact I had seen absolutely nothing. Plus a couple of Jaffa cakes. Now, if the thief is apprehended and the painting returned, I will be able to sleep easier in my bed, knowing I played my part.</p> <p><b> Keep Ken out </b></p> <p>In common with most newspapers, the Independent on Sunday greeted the new year with a bit of speculation about what might lie in store. Under the headline \"We Have Seen The Future\", there was a photo-montage of Mr Tony, arms spread at a familiar evangelical angle, there was also William Hague, Al Gore and Michael Portillo, all reflecting a potential political landscape. And in the middle of them all, his head popping out from behind a trading screen, for no apparent reason was none other than Kenneth Branagh.</p> <p>Underneath the picture was a long article full of references to those other great Kens, Livingstone and Clarke, but without mention of the Branagh moniker. It turned out the text referring to the cinematic polymath was confusingly buried a couple of pages away from the illustration. But at first glance, it seemed as if the paper really had looked into the future and produced a stunning political idea.</p> <p>Think about the possibilities, for instance, of the brilliant marriage of luvvies and politicos that would arise from a Branagh candidacy for London mayor. Branagh has, after all, long since proved his credentials as an operator straight out of the Blair mould. Thus instead of Tony's Cronies, should he be elected in May, we could have Ken's Friends appointed to all the right places. Helena Bonham Carter, perhaps, as the capital's first minister for the underclass; Emma Thompson given the new parenting portfolio; and in charge of transport, with special dispensation to smooth the passage of those seeking cross-channel travel in a hurry: Stephen Fry. On second thoughts, just thinking about it gives a whole new dimension to the Stop Ken campaign.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Remember a film called Revenge of the Nerds? Thought not. In truth it was not Hollywood's finest moment. Released in 1984, the movie is a sub-Animal House student romp centring on a group of pizza-faced boffins who, fed up with years of bullying at the hands of the jock establishment, wreak allegedly humorous campus havoc by re-programming the college computer. In the process they win over the pneumatic cheer-leading sorority who obligingly remove their bras in admiration. When his feeble effort plunged straight to video, little did the director Peter Samuelson realise that, 16 years later, the movie would provide the perfect commentary on our times. As the last few days have proved, the Nerds have got their revenge: the 21st century belongs to them. Not only do Nerds officially occupy most of the higher positions in the world's rich list, they have now assumed a position of absolute power over all our lives. Young, clever and knowledgable in way which we techno-Luddites cannot imagine, we are terrified of them. We will do anything they tell us, throw any amount of money in their direction, just as long as they keep our computers working. On a local scale, we all fall into the thrall of the Nerd the moment we buy a PC, something we are constantly told we must do if we wish to keep apace with the revolution out there. In some barn on a ring road, a youth with perma-gelled hair fills your head with talk of mega rams and sends you home with a ludicrously expensive machine apparently capable of launching the space shuttle but incapable, you discover the moment you switch it on, of printing a letter. So you call a telephone support operative, sitting in an aircraft hangar somewhere near Dumfries. There is nothing in the world capable of inducing a volcanic loss of temper as quickly as a telephone support operative, especially when they ask if Sir has plugged the computer in yet. As they utter platitudes in that jargon-filled argot designed entirely to make you feel stupid, you splutter: \"But don't your realise my business depends on this?\" And when they respond with a meaningful \"Ah well, if Sir is using the computer for business purposes, Sir should have bought a business machine in the first place,\" you find your mouse has been smashed into a dozen pieces beneath your fist. So you ring a Nerd prepared to come for a house visit, even though his hourly call-out rate matches that of a libel QC. Like a digital garage mechanic or roofing contractor, he sucks through his teeth on his arrival and tells you that you need an extra giga-byte, with hard disk overdrive. And because you haven't a clue what he is talking about, you take his word and pay up, softened by his console-side manner, the technological equivalent of old ladies who make over their entire will to the doctor who speaks kindly to them on their death beds. So it was with the millennium bug. Few of us could quite understand why it was that our microwave would be confused by the change of century into thinking it was preparing M&amp;S chicken madras on January 1 1900, and thus refuse to defrost, but if a Nerd told us that would happen we believed them. Then we paid them whatever they told us was necessary to make sure that come the day, our curry cooked in time. At the BBC, for instance, more than \u00a310m was spent getting the corporation compliant. That's enough to have kept Des Lynam. Well, almost. Encouraged by uber-Nerd John Birt, fighting the bug was given top priority at the Beeb. Distinguished programme-makers found themselves bullied by 23-year-old computer boffins telling them they couldn't do anything until the bug was sorted. I know this because I met the BBC's Y2K supremo just before Christmas. Disarmingly cheerful as the predicted armageddon approached, he had clearly had the time of his life this past year, as anyone would when operating in the joyous knowledge that everyone will do whatever you tell them. After a taste of being in charge he wasn't going to let anything as trivial as the arrival of 2000 see him out of a job. \"There's going to be plenty of follow-up work all through next year,\" he told me. So prevalent was the Nerd agenda at the BBC that, during the marathon television coverage of the millennium, a rumour swept TV Centre as midnight passed in Moscow that the bug had triggered a nuclear assault and the missiles were on their way. For a few moments, panic gripped the studio; everyone was going to die, and all because the Russians couldn't be arsed to ring the government help line. Bizarrely, even though in the end nothing happened, even though poor Peter Snow's Bugometer only twitched briefly in the direction of a tax office in Gabon, the Nerds have still come out of it all smelling of cash and influence. They tell us nothing went wrong, not because there was never any threat in the first place, but because relevant, pricey precautions were taken. This is the really clever bit of the Nerd revenge: since we don't know, we can't gainsay them. And so we yield afresh to the new masters of the universe. My part in the C\u00e9zanne heist Living a few doors down from Oxford's Ashmolean museum, scene of the New Year's Eve C\u00e9zanne heist, I have been involved for the first time in my life in that great British institution: the house-to-house inquiry. Ever since the robbery, our street has been filled with police, large men in para-military garb with macho displays of hardwear dangling from their belts staring into our cellar and bringing to mind thoughts about stable doors and bolting horses. Yesterday a constable appeared on the doorstep asking if I had been in the neighbourhood on the night of the robbery. People always say that when a policeman knocks on the door, however innocent you might be, a strange panic kicks in which obliges you to provide far more information than is strictly necessary. Now I know it is true. Instead of a simple sorry, I wasn't here, it was after all New Year's Eve, I found myself spewing out details of the party we were at, the location, the guest list, the quality of the fireworks, the fact I'm more of a Monet man myself. I only just stopped short of offering Jeffrey Archer's name as a corroborative witness for an alibi. \"I'd better come in and get all this down,\" said the policeman. And in he came, jovially confiding that this inquiry made a change from the usual \"mundane stuff\". \"Mundane stuff?\" I said. \"Oh you know,\" he said. \"Bottlings, glassings, stabbings, your usual New Year's Eve.\" After 20 minutes he had extracted from me my name, address, age, telephone number and the fact I had seen absolutely nothing. Plus a couple of Jaffa cakes. Now, if the thief is apprehended and the painting returned, I will be able to sleep easier in my bed, knowing I played my part. Keep Ken out In common with most newspapers, the Independent on Sunday greeted the new year with a bit of speculation about what might lie in store. Under the headline \"We Have Seen The Future\", there was a photo-montage of Mr Tony, arms spread at a familiar evangelical angle, there was also William Hague, Al Gore and Michael Portillo, all reflecting a potential political landscape. And in the middle of them all, his head popping out from behind a trading screen, for no apparent reason was none other than Kenneth Branagh. Underneath the picture was a long article full of references to those other great Kens, Livingstone and Clarke, but without mention of the Branagh moniker. It turned out the text referring to the cinematic polymath was confusingly buried a couple of pages away from the illustration. But at first glance, it seemed as if the paper really had looked into the future and produced a stunning political idea. Think about the possibilities, for instance, of the brilliant marriage of luvvies and politicos that would arise from a Branagh candidacy for London mayor. Branagh has, after all, long since proved his credentials as an operator straight out of the Blair mould. Thus instead of Tony's Cronies, should he be elected in May, we could have Ken's Friends appointed to all the right places. Helena Bonham Carter, perhaps, as the capital's first minister for the underclass; Emma Thompson given the new parenting portfolio; and in charge of transport, with special dispensation to smooth the passage of those seeking cross-channel travel in a hurry: Stephen Fry. On second thoughts, just thinking about it gives a whole new dimension to the Stop Ken campaign.",

      "bodyText": "President Bill Clinton ensured that the year AD2000 would not become AG1 yesterday when he renominated Alan Greenspan as the head of the world's most powerful central bank. The announcement comes more than six months before Mr Greenspan's fourth four-year term as chairman of the Federal Reserve comes to an end in June. Analysts and economists, who welcomed the reappointment of a man some have referred to as \"God\", said that Mr Clinton was keen to remove any uncertainty over the appointment in a presidential election year. The reappointment, still to be voted on in the senate, reflects the importance of Mr Greenspan to the world's financial markets. Some commentators have used the term AG to refer to the post-Greenspan era. In announcing his decision, Mr Clinton credited the Fed, which controls monetary policy, for its role in the longest peacetime economic expansion in the United States. He praised Mr Greenspan for inspiring confidence around the world and overseeing the stock market gains of recent years. He even joked that if he could only take \"Alan.com\" public he might be able to clear the national debt earlier than expected. Mr Greenspan, first appointed by President Reagan in 1987, is 73. He explained his desire to continue in the post by speaking of the \"unimaginable intellectual interest one gets... from putting broad theoretical concepts to the test in the marketplace\". However, the man who can make share prices plummet with a passing reference refused to respond to the US markets' performance yesterday as they traded sharply lower.

Mr Rollason said National Express would be interested in several of these. The group kept out of the first round of new bids - for GNER, Chiltern and London South Central - and has eschewed interest in taking over troubled bus operator MTL. Yesterday's purchase, for cash, of ATC is the group's second US bus acquisition in six months: it paid $178.5m in August for school bus operator Durham. ATC, operating in 44 cities in 18 states, is the largest privately owned provider of public transit services in America and last year made $10.9m on $153.1m sales.

Mr Rollason said National Express planned to take on a third leg of its US operations by spending a similar amount on acquiring an operator of commuter buses - and expanding the business through other bolt-on purchases. The ATC purchase will boost buses' share of group turnover to 35% and of profits to 40%. The US bus business is set to provide about 15% of group sales of \u00a31.5bn but the aim is to double the figure to about $600m. North America contributes about 15% of group profits as well but could see greater growth than in the mature British market, said Mr Rollason. \"I would be very disappointed if we could not get double-digit margins out of the business,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>Think of news without context and without characters. An outgoing president reappoints an ageing banker to head the country's central bank for his fourth consecutive term, despite the fact that the incumbent will be in the thick end of his eighties if and when he finishes the job. </p> <p>There is no debate over this, no dissent, no succession battle, no offering-up of alternative candidates. It is taken as the natural thing to do, and is accompanied by all the usual verbal back-slap ping. The financial world really is in danger of assuming that Mr Alan Greenspan is a new biological paradigm - not just the man who brought us a fresh economic one. </p> <p>President Clinton certainly bears the Federal Reserve chairman no ill will, and it would have looked a tad ungrateful to crowbar the man from his post when he has professed himself to be fit and ready to fight on. </p> <p>In one month's time the American economy will have been growing for the longest unbroken period since economic reckoning began. </p> <p>Mr Greenspan's record is pristine: re-inflating the American economy out of recession a decade ago; managing the bond blow-out four years later; then applying careful massage in the wake of the multiple shocks of the past two years - Asia, Russia, Long Term Capital Management, Brazil. </p> <p>He, more than anyone, is responsible for a sense that the Fed, sitting at the centre of the world's financial apparatus, has become truly adept at controlling what on paper appears to be uncontrollable. Why try to fix something that is not broken? </p> <p>Now slip on your political specs. Wall Street has been gossiping since last spring about when exactly Mr Clinton might renew Mr Greenspan's contract. A consensus had developed that the presidency was holding off from a statement on the succession at the Fed as a sort of subtle lever on policy - in an election year it did not want either an emboldened Mr Greenspan applying the monetary screws too soon or the potential dislocation that a replacement for Mr Greenspan might bring about in the markets. </p> <p>So the timing of Mr Clinton's statement - on the second business day of the year and with world markets appearing as jittery as we have seen for many months - smacks of White House spin. It is as though there is a burning, short-term desire to underwrite the asset price bubble on Wall Street. </p> <p>But the real medium-term effect is to push out the debate about Mr Greenspan's successor even further, just at a point - to be cold and real - when the odds on the great man dropping dead one day are beginning to shorten alarmingly. He might well become other worldly in a literal sense. By shouting \"four more years\", rather than \"two more\" and then posting a job advertisement, Mr Clinton has just increased the risk premium attached to the world's leading stock markets. </p> <p><strong> Peg etiquette </strong><br> </p> <p> The last echoes of the 1997 currency crisis may be fading, but efforts to prevent a repeat of the south-east Asian market meltdown rumble on. Finance ministers jetting into Tokyo for the meeting of the G7 industrialised nations this month can expect to be faced with a Japanese proposal for the creation of a basket of leading currencies - the yen, the dollar and the euro to name but three - against which emerging market economies might peg their currencies. </p> <p>Such thinking is unsurprising. Currency instability on the scale which shocked south-east Asia in the autumn of 1997 and from which Latin America has suffered from time to time is widely regarded as bad news. </p> <p>Nor is currency pegging a new idea. The question is whether exchange rate stability can be an instrument of economic policy or a consequence. Hong Kong has successfully pegged its currency to the greenback for years, but arguably the region's exposure to the American economy makes the peg a workable option. </p> <p>Aspiring members of the European Union may see sense in tracking the euro - but only because their long-term goal is one of close convergence. </p> <p>Britain's flirtation with even so flexible a \"peg\" as the exchange rate mechanism shows the dangers of linking exchange rates between economies which are out of step. It can be difficult, too, to command political support for the surrender of monetary policy authority implicit in pegging. </p> <p>Using a basket does have an advantage over a single currency tie in that it mitigates the risk of a sudden, sharp movement of the reference currency dragging the pegged currency in an unwanted direction. </p> <p>But without the right mix of economic policies, pegs turn the foreign exchanges into a happy hunting ground for speculators. </p> <p>Currencies - like any target - are easier to hit when they are anchored.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Think of news without context and without characters. An outgoing president reappoints an ageing banker to head the country's central bank for his fourth consecutive term, despite the fact that the incumbent will be in the thick end of his eighties if and when he finishes the job. There is no debate over this, no dissent, no succession battle, no offering-up of alternative candidates. It is taken as the natural thing to do, and is accompanied by all the usual verbal back-slap ping. The financial world really is in danger of assuming that Mr Alan Greenspan is a new biological paradigm - not just the man who brought us a fresh economic one. President Clinton certainly bears the Federal Reserve chairman no ill will, and it would have looked a tad ungrateful to crowbar the man from his post when he has professed himself to be fit and ready to fight on. In one month's time the American economy will have been growing for the longest unbroken period since economic reckoning began. Mr Greenspan's record is pristine: re-inflating the American economy out of recession a decade ago; managing the bond blow-out four years later; then applying careful massage in the wake of the multiple shocks of the past two years - Asia, Russia, Long Term Capital Management, Brazil. He, more than anyone, is responsible for a sense that the Fed, sitting at the centre of the world's financial apparatus, has become truly adept at controlling what on paper appears to be uncontrollable. Why try to fix something that is not broken? Now slip on your political specs. Wall Street has been gossiping since last spring about when exactly Mr Clinton might renew Mr Greenspan's contract. A consensus had developed that the presidency was holding off from a statement on the succession at the Fed as a sort of subtle lever on policy - in an election year it did not want either an emboldened Mr Greenspan applying the monetary screws too soon or the potential dislocation that a replacement for Mr Greenspan might bring about in the markets. So the timing of Mr Clinton's statement - on the second business day of the year and with world markets appearing as jittery as we have seen for many months - smacks of White House spin. It is as though there is a burning, short-term desire to underwrite the asset price bubble on Wall Street. But the real medium-term effect is to push out the debate about Mr Greenspan's successor even further, just at a point - to be cold and real - when the odds on the great man dropping dead one day are beginning to shorten alarmingly. He might well become other worldly in a literal sense. By shouting \"four more years\", rather than \"two more\" and then posting a job advertisement, Mr Clinton has just increased the risk premium attached to the world's leading stock markets. Peg etiquette The last echoes of the 1997 currency crisis may be fading, but efforts to prevent a repeat of the south-east Asian market meltdown rumble on. Finance ministers jetting into Tokyo for the meeting of the G7 industrialised nations this month can expect to be faced with a Japanese proposal for the creation of a basket of leading currencies - the yen, the dollar and the euro to name but three - against which emerging market economies might peg their currencies. Such thinking is unsurprising. Currency instability on the scale which shocked south-east Asia in the autumn of 1997 and from which Latin America has suffered from time to time is widely regarded as bad news. Nor is currency pegging a new idea. The question is whether exchange rate stability can be an instrument of economic policy or a consequence. Hong Kong has successfully pegged its currency to the greenback for years, but arguably the region's exposure to the American economy makes the peg a workable option. Aspiring members of the European Union may see sense in tracking the euro - but only because their long-term goal is one of close convergence. Britain's flirtation with even so flexible a \"peg\" as the exchange rate mechanism shows the dangers of linking exchange rates between economies which are out of step. It can be difficult, too, to command political support for the surrender of monetary policy authority implicit in pegging. Using a basket does have an advantage over a single currency tie in that it mitigates the risk of a sudden, sharp movement of the reference currency dragging the pegged currency in an unwanted direction. But without the right mix of economic policies, pegs turn the foreign exchanges into a happy hunting ground for speculators. Currencies - like any target - are easier to hit when they are anchored.",

In points terms the drop amounted to 264.3 off the FTSE 100 index, which settled at 6665.9. The blame was placed on the yawning gap between bond yields, which rose to take into account of the likelihood of higher borrowing costs and soaring equities - just one of the traditional valuation measures which have been ignored by speculators recently. The real damage to the Footsie came in the form of several heavyweight fallers.

The company has warned that it will report a small op erating loss for the full year and is likely to pass its final dividend. South African-based Old Mutual fell 11p to 157p after selling its British life insurance business. The deal involved a complicated two-pronged sale which it said was at \u00a315m above the book value of the business - which has been closed to new policies since 1998.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is not hard to date the start of what has been called the new-play renaissance. The Royal Court's 1994/5 season, which included works by Joe Penhall, Sarah Kane and Nick Grosso, was the start of an extraordinary run of plays at the Royal Court, the Bush and beyond that saw Kane's Blasted making the front pages, Mark Ravenhill's Shopping and Fucking not only taking over the West End but also making Bury St Edmunds sit up and take notice, and Patrick Marber's Dealer's Choice and Closer packing out the National Theatre with young audiences usually to be found at the cinema. </p> <p>It generated a sharp new sense of optimism. British theatre was once again hailed as the most exciting in the world. Over the past five years there have been over 400 productions worldwide of plays premiered at the Royal Court. </p> <p>But when it comes to new writing, confidence plays a part. It is rather harder to place the moment when the jitters set in a few seasons later. Perhaps it was the night last spring when Kane committed suicide aged just 28. Or maybe it was the moment in early summer when Out of Joint announced the delay of Ravenhill's Some Explicit Polaroids, widely seen as the follow-up to Shopping and Fucking by those who conveniently forgot that Ravenhill had already produced two further fine plays, Faust and Handbag. When Polaroids finally premiered at the New Ambassadors in the autumn, its merits tended to be overshadowed by the fact that this was no Shopping and Fucking. </p> <p>Then there were the Evening Standard theatre awards and the widely publicised decision not to give an award in the best new play category. The National too has played its part in the haemorrhaging of confidence: the poor reviews for Stephen Poliakoff's Remember This and Nick Stafford's Battle Royal once again raised niggling doubts over the appointment of Trevor Nunn as artistic director. Nunn's directorial prowess has never been doubted but he has never been noted for his espousal of new writing. </p> <p>In the circumstances, the opening of the Royal Court's newly refurbished \u00a326.5m building in Sloane Square, scheduled for this week but now delayed by technical hitches (not a confidence booster, that), and the arrival this week of the Soho Theatre Company in a new \u00a310.5m building in the West End that is due to open its doors in March, could hardly come at a less auspicious time. Who needs \u00a337m-worth of buildings devoted to new writing if new writing is in the doldrums? It rather puts you in mind of Richard Eyre's original comment on lottery-funded projects: lots of wonderful new restaurants and no food. </p> <p>Such thinking is regarded as heretical by the Court's literary manager, Graham Wybrow, and Abigail Morris, artistic director of the Soho Theatre Company. Both argue persuasively that if there is any crisis in new writing - which they doubt, pointing to the fact that each could have filled their opening season two or three times over - then it is only a minor wobble, and perhaps entirely due to their theatres' prolonged absence from producing. The Royal Court's move from the West End back to Sloane Square means it has produced no new work since early 1999, and the Soho's enforced inactivity has created a crucial imbalance at the bottom of the new-writing pyramid where writers start out. </p> <p>Over at the Bush, which has just enjoyed one of its most successful seasons with audience attendance averaging 74%, artistic director Mike Bradwell is also sceptical about reports of the death of new writing. But then, he's always been pretty sceptical about the boom. </p> <p>\"The so-called renaissance in new writing was a renaissance in writing about new writing, which became fashionable because of all those boys' plays - and I include Sarah Kane - at the Royal Court. It's a fashion, just in the way that finding Goethe plays and staging them on slopes was a fashion in the 80s,\" says Bradwell. </p> <p>He points to the Bush's own success last year with accessible, popular plays such as Mark O'Rowe's brilliant Howie the Rookie and Catherine Johnson's girls-behaving-badly drama Shang-a-Lang, which packed out in London before touring the regions. </p> <p>\"We are feeling pretty buoyant,\" says Bradwell, while still pointing out that the Bush faces huge difficulties. \"We pay the same for a commission now as we did 10 years ago and we very quickly lose writers to film and TV.\" He also believes that the Almeida and Donmar-led trend for event theatre stuffed full of Hollywood stars makes audiences more demanding. \"They cherry-pick. They only want to see hits.\" </p> <p>It is a point that Jack Bradley, literary manager at the National Theatre, takes up: \"People go to the movies and come out saying, 'Well, it wasn't Citizen Kane but it was a pleasant night out.' But they have a different attitude to theatre. They say 'This isn't as good as Richard III' and feel unhappy.\" </p> <p>Certainly, besides the desire to see Nicole Kidman with her kit off, there also appears to be a huge hunger in audiences for theatre that offers a more visceral and participatory experience than is generally available from the play, new or otherwise. The sell-out success of shows such as Shock-Headed Peter, De La Guarda, Deborah Warner's Tower Project and Frantic Assembly more than bears that out. But literary managers such as Wybrow are canny enough to realise that blaming the audience for a crisis of confidence in new writing is silly. </p> <p>If, like the Royal Court, it is a theatre's remit to find and put on new plays, then it is that theatre's responsibility to create the conditions that allow writers to flourish,\" he says. \"It is a culture, not a fountain. I still feel that we have to prove this is a sustainable culture against the lost generations of writers from the 80s when attacks on text-based theatre predominated. The conditions for new plays and playwrights are always precarious. It is our responsibility to fight for them and it means you have to have an eye on both the present and the future.\" </p> <p>Yet despite the efforts of people like Wybrow, a lack of confidence does persist in some quarters. As one literary agent told me: \"I think there is beginning to be a backlash against the literary text. It makes theatres less bold and more reluctant to take risks. We have a lot of plays that ought to find homes but I know won't. That is not an encouraging situation for writers to be in. They give up writing plays and write screenplays or novels instead.\" </p> <p>Bradley at the National believes that the energy that was focused on theatre may now have moved to Wardour Street and the British film industry, but adds that appearances may be deceptive and that there is no shortage of new work coming out of the National Theatre Studio. From his point of view the problem is programming it within the context of the theatre's ensemble and spaces, which demand plays of a certain scale. \"You can put a big play in a small space but you can't put a one-man show in the Olivier,\" he says. But he argues that the National has some gems and that depending on the public's appetite for The Mysteries (currently running till the end of March) we will see an entire season of Studio-generated work in the Cottesloe some time after Easter. </p> <p>Despite the hitch that means Conor McPherson's Dublin Carol will now open at the Old Vic before transferring to the Royal Court for its delayed opening in February, the Court's return to Sloane Square should be enough of an event in itself to give new writing a fillip. But as Soho's Morris, who has already had experience of opening a new theatre, points out, there are pitfalls involved. \"People tend to look at what you do very critically. Everyone knows how much the Court and the Soho have cost and if you're not careful, they will look at the first work you put on and what will run through their minds is the thought 'Is this play worth \u00a311m?' \" </p> <p>The Soho's solution is a plan to programme a wide-ranging season of work that will have short runs, so that no single play or playwright carries the burden of expectation and critical attention. </p> <p>\"We can only do that because we've got so many good plays looking for productions,\" says the Soho's literary manager, Paul Sirrett. \"I think this is a fantastic time for new writing and that the Court and we are going to be producing again just at the right moment. It's just doom-mongering to start saying new writing is dead. People like to impose history. We'll only really know in the year 2020 if new writing did die in 1999. The obituaries are premature.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Conor McPherson's Dublin Carol is at the Old Vic, London SE1 (0171-565 5000), from January 15, and transfers to the Royal Court, Sloane Square, London SW1, in mid-February.</p>",

But he argues that the National has some gems and that depending on the public's appetite for The Mysteries (currently running till the end of March) we will see an entire season of Studio-generated work in the Cottesloe some time after Easter. Despite the hitch that means Conor McPherson's Dublin Carol will now open at the Old Vic before transferring to the Royal Court for its delayed opening in February, the Court's return to Sloane Square should be enough of an event in itself to give new writing a fillip. But as Soho's Morris, who has already had experience of opening a new theatre, points out, there are pitfalls involved. \"People tend to look at what you do very critically. Everyone knows how much the Court and the Soho have cost and if you're not careful, they will look at the first work you put on and what will run through their minds is the thought 'Is this play worth \u00a311m?' \" The Soho's solution is a plan to programme a wide-ranging season of work that will have short runs, so that no single play or playwright carries the burden of expectation and critical attention. \"We can only do that because we've got so many good plays looking for productions,\" says the Soho's literary manager, Paul Sirrett. \"I think this is a fantastic time for new writing and that the Court and we are going to be producing again just at the right moment. It's just doom-mongering to start saying new writing is dead. People like to impose history. We'll only really know in the year 2020 if new writing did die in 1999. The obituaries are premature.\" \u0095 Conor McPherson's Dublin Carol is at the Old Vic, London SE1 (0171-565 5000), from January 15, and transfers to the Royal Court, Sloane Square, London SW1, in mid-February.",

      "body": "<p>Share prices plunged on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday as investors woke up to the realisation that interest rates are poised to rise around the world. </p> <p>The Eurotop 300 index of Europe's leading companies fell 4% while the FTSE 100 index fell 3.8%, the 8th largest percentage fall in its 16-year history.</p> <p>In the US, markets opened sharply lower for the second day and by the London close the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 200 points, triggering emergency trading curbs to prevent volatility. It continued to fall and was more than 300 points down an hour before the Wall Street close. The US technology index Nasdaq was off 3.8% at the London close after setting a record high on Monday.</p> <p>Europe could be the first to endure the pain of higher borrowing costs after the European Central Bank meets today. Britain's monetary policy committee meets next week.</p> <p>In the US, where financial markets often set the tone for Europe, investors could be jittery until the next meeting of the banking authorities in February.</p> <p>\"The US financial markets are waking up to the fact that US interest rates need to go up,\" said Gerard Lyons, global head of treasury research at Standard Chartered.</p> <p>The realisation appeared to be reflected in the sharp rise in very long-term US interest rates on Monday when yields on 30-year US government bonds reached two-year highs.

      "bodyText": "Share prices plunged on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday as investors woke up to the realisation that interest rates are poised to rise around the world. The Eurotop 300 index of Europe's leading companies fell 4% while the FTSE 100 index fell 3.8%, the 8th largest percentage fall in its 16-year history. In the US, markets opened sharply lower for the second day and by the London close the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 200 points, triggering emergency trading curbs to prevent volatility. It continued to fall and was more than 300 points down an hour before the Wall Street close. The US technology index Nasdaq was off 3.8% at the London close after setting a record high on Monday. Europe could be the first to endure the pain of higher borrowing costs after the European Central Bank meets today. Britain's monetary policy committee meets next week. In the US, where financial markets often set the tone for Europe, investors could be jittery until the next meeting of the banking authorities in February. \"The US financial markets are waking up to the fact that US interest rates need to go up,\" said Gerard Lyons, global head of treasury research at Standard Chartered. The realisation appeared to be reflected in the sharp rise in very long-term US interest rates on Monday when yields on 30-year US government bonds reached two-year highs. That suggested investors expect inflationary pressures to build up in the years ahead, prompting increases in official rates from the the authorities to curb price rises. Among the sectors hardest hit were the \"dot.com\" stocks and particularly telecoms as well as companies sensitive to interest rate movements such as banks. One analyst said highly geared hi-tech stocks were extremely sensitive to interest rates on long-dated bonds because their stock market valuations are based on expectations of future earnings, which might be eroded by higher inflation. The end of year rally in \"dot.com\" stocks, fuelled by small investors, also allowed some big players to realise their potential gains yesterday. \"It's profit-taking on the back of the recent strong run, and concerns over interest rates have been the catalyst,\" said Jeremy Batstone, head of research at NatWest stockbrokers. Mr Batstone said rumours that the European Central Bank was poised to withdraw liquidity injected into the market at the end of the year to cushion any pain from the millennium bug - which failed to materialise - had also served to unbalance sentiment. Not all shares fell sharply. One of the day's biggest gainers was Marks &amp; Spencer which jumped more than 5% on speculation that it will be taken over by a rival. Some big internet stocks such as Psion also registered rises. Few analysts suggested yesterday's sharp falls marked the beginning of a prolonged bear market, describing the move instead as a much needed pause for breath in an overheated market. Many, though, believe the internet sector, which drove much of last year's rally, might be the first to fall back. Byron Wein, the bearish but widely followed chief market strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, predicted a correction among internet stocks this year. \"I am not saying that the internet is not going to reward investors over the long term,\" he said. \"But a number of these stocks have gone ahead of themselves.\"",

I had three people in my department and we worked in an open-plan office. My boss complained because we made too much noise, so I just told my staff what she said and asked them to be less rowdy. They gave me a lot of flak because they felt I hadn't supported them. I went back to the boss and explained the situation, that as a sales team we had to chat people up on the phone, so we were going to make more noise.

I have one member of staff who is a terrible worrier. She'll have a sleepless night if the petty cash balance isn't right to the last penny. If on a Friday I have to tell her something I know will worry her, I'll leave it until Monday, otherwise she'll spend all weekend fretting about it. It's just counter-productive. Another member of staff hates dealing with changes, so I give her early warning of them. Then she's happier about the situation and does a better job. </p> <p><strong> Katie James, 42</strong> project manager </p> <p>I learnt how to manage by being badly managed myself. I had a boss who would constantly avoid discussing issues with me. When I became a manager myself, a really nice guy worked for me who was just not performing well. I supported him but it still wasn't working and it wasn't helped by the fact that he had a stiff upper lip and just tried to get on with it. In the end I had to let him go. He broke down and it's awful for a woman to have a man break down like that. You just have to be sympathetic and practical. I found him a job in another part of the organisation and he was tremendously grateful. </p> <p><strong> Christopher Jones, 30</strong> restaurant manager </p> <p>It's important to see things from your staff's point of view. One employee came to me upset that she always had to work on a Friday night; when she approached the general manager, he said there was nothing he could do. I told her to keep copies of her shifts for a month, then we took them to show him. He accepted there was a problem - rare for him because he was very defensive.

I used to have a real disciplinarian for a boss and although we all worked hard, we did it through gritted teeth. As a manager, I run a relatively relaxed ship. I reckon you should try to enjoy yourself in your job as far as possible and fit in some quality time with your staff.

There was no time management seminar, no flashy flip-charts. Instead they were faced with cardboard, paint and glue - not that useful when it comes to working out how to sell more cashmere cardigans but essential for the mask-making workshop their boss had signed them up for. </p> <p>Organised by creativity group Oracy, the day-long session required each delegate to create a mask to represent the face they presented at work. \"Mask-making is a very effective corporate tool,\" claims Charlene Collison of Oracy. \"Often people create faces that are anxious and alienated. It helps them access their intuitive, imaginative skills. Companies are starting to nurture those qualities.\" </p> <p>It's an unconventional approach but one that is catching on fast. The business sections of booksellers' are crammed with creativity manuals including The Artist's Way At Work, a corporate version of Julia Cameron's million-selling 12-step programme for blocked creatives. Further proof comes in the unlikely guise of London comedy club Jongleurs, which has launched a corporate programme to inspire stressed-out executives by teaching them to do stand-up routines. A host of firms have already signed up. </p> <p>Creativity has become a highly-prized commodity, even in less than fizzy professions such as accountancy. Whereas once we could drag ourselves into work each day, safe in the expectation of doing nothing more taxing than, er, work, now bosses have other ideas. They have finally begun to see that if you sit in a boring meeting in a boring conference room, you will inevitably emerge with boring ideas. </p> <p>Work, it would appear, is no longer working. \"Play is becoming the buzzword,\" says Patrick Burns, policy director of the Industrial Society. \"As companies become desperate to harness creativity and lateral thinking, they are being forced to look at new ways of fostering those talents. These days, we are seeing everything from mime, circus skills and comedy to finger-painting and story-telling.\" </p> <p>As one would expect, the roots of the play industry lie on the other side of the Atlantic. Ten years ago, marketing firm Play pioneered the techniques now taking off here. Staff at Play invent their own superheroes and make their own costumes. They have an office play-room and a company dog which is picked up for work even when its owner is away, and there are no conventional job titles. Instead, employees have business cards printed with peculiar slogans such as \"What if\" and \"Voice of reason\". </p> <p>\"When you turn work into a place that encourages people to be themselves, have fun and take risks, you unleash their creativity. The best ideas come from playful minds and the way to tap into that playfulness is to play together,\" says Andy Stefanovich, Play's 33-year-old co-founder. </p> <p>Maria Kempinska, co-founder of Jongleurs, believes this approach has helped her own business and inspired her to set up the corporate comedy school. \"All companies are hungry for new ideas,\" she explains, \"but if you push and pull in a pressured environment, ideas rarely come. Forward-looking companies realise a good atmosphere at work and good relations with colleagues are crucial to hanging on to staff. Teaching them how to laugh with each other and communicate honestly is a good start. So far, surprisingly few have used the workshop to have a go at their boss.\" </p> <p> Kempinska does admit, however, that the types of companies who are likely to sign up are the ones who have least need for it: young, gung-ho firms in new media and advertising. Jim Andrews of Thinc! Digital, a new media firm, was one of the first guinea pigs. \"It was great fun! I do a lot of presentations to clients and you do them in a linear way. But this made me think laterally. Some companies send people on challenges and adventure things - this is another way of getting people together, focused and excited.\" </p> <p>Charlene Collison believes creativity breeds confidence. \"As well as mask-making, we do story-telling workshops. One client, the Humberside Training and Enterprise Council, found these particularly beneficial. There was one woman who presented a story about how nervous she felt giving a presentation to the board; she said she felt like a rabbit caught in the headlights and her teeth felt too big for her mouth. So we acted out a story with her as the rabbit and the humour of it allowed her to overcome that fear. Often we use heroic myths and symbols, slaying dragons and other metaphors.\" </p> <p>It all sounds worryingly new age but Oracy has been called in by Smith Klein Beecham, Hedron, Chesterton Property and various government agencies. They have also worked with staff at the Industrial Society. \"We asked them to describe the Society as if it were a landscape,\" Collison says. \"At first everyone talked about how it was a beautiful, serene place. Then someone described a bog, another a volcano about to erupt. It's all about encouraging better communication.\" </p> <p>Collison believes the benefits to firms are tangible. \"We've had lots of feedback, about how staff bring more passion and ideas to their work, whatever field they are employed in. They take more risks and are more adventurous and more honest.\" </p> <p>There are signs that the spirit of playfulness has its uses beyond rescuing companies from creative bankruptcy, too. Phil Besley of Fools Gold runs clown workshops for companies as diverse as Norwich Union, Warwick University and British Gas. He claims playing can help employees confront their inner fears. \"We get people to write a story about a situation that's bothering them, then we clown it. It's not about being funny, it's about developing self-expression. A clown is like a shaman, he can transform difficult issues.\" </p> <p>One suspects British Gas won't like to be reminded that their employees have this special skill next time one of us decides to quibble about our bill.</p>",

Day ambles through it all with his trademark blokish insouciance, as if eager to prove that he is cooler than his career suggests. </p> <p>The music is mostly of the jukebox variety. Queen's Don't Stop Me Now heralds Dick's appearance.

Morocco, to where our adventurers travel, is a superannuated stereotype.

Luke Baxter makes a lithe, menacing King Rat with a satisfyingly malevolent laugh. </p> <p>But the evening's most authentic expression of ruthlessness came from the audience. \"What shall we do to him?\" asks Dick of his too-easily vanquished foe.

Day ambles through it all with his trademark blokish insouciance, as if eager to prove that he is cooler than his career suggests. The music is mostly of the jukebox variety. Queen's Don't Stop Me Now heralds Dick's appearance. His fairy godmother sings Lloyd Webber - and she is supposed to be a goodie! - while his mayoral fantasies play out to the tune of Somewhere Over the Rainbow. Note to Mr Livingstone: \"The dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.\" Red Ken would approve of little else. The cast promote their sponsors' chocolates. Morocco, to where our adventurers travel, is a superannuated stereotype. At least the puns flicker with life: \"Do not call me 'mate', just kneel!\" orders the Sultan. \"Sorry, Neil,\" says Idle Jack. Luke Baxter makes a lithe, menacing King Rat with a satisfyingly malevolent laugh. But the evening's most authentic expression of ruthlessness came from the audience. \"What shall we do to him?\" asks Dick of his too-easily vanquished foe. Cue the attendant kids, as one: \"Kill him!\" \u0095 Until January 23. Box office: 0181-940 0088",
