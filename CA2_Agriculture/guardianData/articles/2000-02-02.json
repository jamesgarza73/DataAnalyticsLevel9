      "bodyText": "Chelsea's options broadened at one end and narrowed at the other yesterday when Gianluca Vialli came out of retirement and Frank Leboeuf was banned for two matches for stamping on Harry Kewell. Leboeuf pleaded guilty to misconduct at a Football Association disciplinary hearing and apologised for his actions during Chelsea's 2-0 home defeat by Leeds in December. The defender has already served a two-match suspension after being sent off for two fouls on Kewell. The second, a trip, was followed by the trample. \"I apologised because I know I did something wrong,\" the Frenchman said. \"I have played top football for 12 years and had never done something like that. I said what I thought and I had to tell the truth and the FA treated me fairly.\" The 32-year-old is free to play at Tottenham on Saturday and against Wimbledon the following week. He misses Chelsea's FA Cup quarter-final against Gillingham and the league game against Watford. \"He promised that it would never happen again and was aware that it was not the sort of image he wanted to promote to young players,\" said the FA spokesman Steve Double. Leboeuf apologised publicly to Kewell. It was his second sending-off of the season and he is one booking from another two-match ban. \"He received what he would have received if the referee Jeff Winter had shown a red card rather than two yellows,\" said Chelsea's managing director Colin Hutchinson. \"We accept the judgment.\" Meanwhile Vialli has become a player-manager again, having insisted before the season started that he was retiring to concentrate on coaching. The 35-year-old played 90 minutes for the reserves on Monday, hitting the bar, and has registered himself for domestic and European matches. The Champions League seems the most likely stage for his comeback, with George Weah ineligible, having played in the competition this season for Milan. But Vialli will not be free to play until after the next game at Marseille on February 29 because of his abuse of the fourth official at Lazio in December. Uefa said he could not be on the pitch or the touchline in any capacity in France. Vialli was cleared on January 20 to play in the Premiership and FA Cup but is unlikely to select himself ahead of Chris Sutton, Gianfranco Zola, Tore Andre Flo or Weah. The Italian has not played since the final day of last season at Derby. Bradford have ended their interest in Stan Collymore. \"We have been advised that Aston Villa are holding out for a \u00a33m fee,\" said the chairman Geoffrey Richmond, who was prepared to do business only if the striker cost nothing. Danny Wilson has been named Manager of the Month for January only three days after losing at Gillingham in the FA Cup. \"I'm just hoping that the manager-of-the-month curse has struck early,\" said Wilson, whose side beat Bradford and Tottenham, and drew with Arsenal, to climb off the bottom of the table for the first time since August 20. Three of the FA Cup quarter-finals will be played on Sunday February 20, with Bolton v Charlton the only Saturday match. Tranmere v Newcastle will kick-off at 2pm live on ITV. Everton v Aston Villa will follow at 4pm on Sky. Chelsea v Gillingham will start at 3pm. At 11.30am that morning Leeds play Manchester United in the Premiership.",

In the latest Housing Finance Review, Alan Holmans, a former chief housing economist at the DETR, marks the end of the century by asking what progress has been made in improving housing conditions in Britain. The answer seems to be: quite a lot. </p> <p>The challenge was pretty formidable, for while total population grew by 62%, the number of households tripled. In part, this is because adults formed little over half the population at the start of the 20th century, but three-quarters by the end. </p> <p>But it was not just the extra adults that led to more separate households. An important new trend began in the 1930s and will continue into the next century: adults now increasingly live alone. </p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, the explosion in the number of households was more than matched by the supply of homes. At the start of the century, there was still a crude gap between the two, made worse by two world wars, so that by the beginning of the second half of the century the deficit was at its greatest. Yet within 20 years, the number of homes had been increased by more than half - an unparalleled achievement in which the public sector led the way. </p> <p>During the 1970s, the crude shortage was eliminated as the number of houses overtook the number of households. The fact that shortages continue is due to many of these houses now being in the wrong places or owned as second homes. </p> <p>Holmans points out that the first years of the century, marked by the strongest housing boom till then, are an object lesson in the workings of a free market, in which the major suppliers are private landlords. There was a rising vacancy rate on the eve of the first world war, coexisting with massive overcrowding, because many people did not earn enough to rent a house. </p> <p>Having sufficient houses is one test of progress; their condition is another. If the first big improvement in standards of construction took place before the century began, with the building of the Victorian terraces that still provide us with 15% of our homes, the next - providing proper amenities in every house - followed the first world war. </p> <p>If the housing market and public policy have failed, it is in the state of disrepair and need for improvement in the stock. There are still 3million families in poor housing. Home owners account for the greatest numbers in this category, but as a proportion it is privately-rented housing which is in worst condition. </p> <p>Failure to invest has been made worse by the failure to replace. If houses were to last an average of 100 years each, we would be replacing the poorest at a rate of 200,000 every year. In fact, we demolish only a small fraction of that figure. The much-publicised phenomenon of empty housing in parts of the north is one outcome. </p> <p>Holmans asks whether it was the market or public policy which led to the improvement in housing conditions over the past 100 years. The answer is a bit of both. The amazing expansion of home ownership, from less than 10% then to almost 70% now, transformed conditions for the majority and largely resulted from cheap finance from building societies, aided for the past 30 years by tax relief. </p> <p>But anyone who regards council housing as a failure now should be reminded about what it achieved. Over 1 million families were without a separate home in 1914. They had to wait until the inter-war period for the massive building of cottage estates at low rents that, by the second half of the century, had enabled the demolition of the worst of the Victorian slums. Post-war clearance and redevelopment completed the job. What a disaster that gross misjudgments in how this was done have led to council housing being discredited. </p> <p>\u0095 John Perry is policy director of the Chartered Institute of Housing.

That calculation may have sealed his fate, though he is also seen as a too-visible symbol of the discredited Tory regime.</p> <p>Mr Hague had been planning to bring back Mr Portillo as soon as possible after his by-election victory in Kensington and Chelsea in November, made possible by the death of Alan Clark, whose memorial service Mr Hague attended yesterday.</p> <p>It binds him into the shadow cabinet as it heads for what most analysts believe will be another crushing election defeat - one which Mr Hague may not long survive. Last night Hague aides said it was another strengthening of the party, \"bringing in people of proven ability which intensifies pressure on Tony Blair's failing administration\".</p> <p>Labour replied with some loud raspberries. In a statement Mr Prescott said he had now seen off three shadow spokesmen since 1997 and hoped that Mr Norman \"a director of Railtrack, a hypermarket supremo and a member of Lloyds will be able to bring his experience to bear - provided he can find time to turn up\".</p> <p>Downing Street orchestrated a chorus of jibes against Mr Portillo as a media darling with \"woeful judgement. The public will not forget his record in office\". Hague aides said simply: \"William thought he should put one of our most powerful players against one of theirs.\"</p> <p>Potentially more fruitful was the Liberal Democrats' concentration on Mr Norman's spectacular past as a McKinsey management guru - he hired Mr Hague - who recently sold the Asda supermarket chain (Mr Maude was on the board) to the US giant Walmart. Planning consents from Mr Prescott's department are hugely sensitive.</p> <p>Last night Mr Norman, a less than charismatic Commons performer, said he would \"resolve any potential conflict of interest that might arise\" by bailing out of companies, notably the Knutsford venture capitalist group of which he is a major shareholder, if he has to.</p> <p>With Mr Redwood promising to fight for the Eurosceptic cause on the backbenches, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Alan Beith, said: \"Michael Portillo is now positioned to seize the Tory throne when William Hague falls.\"</p>",

Mr Norman's extensive business interests also came under fire. The musical chairs, known to only a handful of Hague aides until teatime last night, also saw the moderate John Maples dropped as shadow foreign secretary to make way for Francis Maude, the man bumped to bring Mr Portillo into the treasury shadow. The hyperactive Mr Redwood was said to be \"enormously surprised\" when his leader called him into his office, praised him for being both loyal and effective in opposition - then told him it was time to make way for a new blood. Many Tory MPs, even those who suspect he is overrated, were pleased to see Mr Portillo back on the frontbench where he has the experience, as an ex-treasury minister, to take on the formidable Mr Brown who has managed to avoid the recession predicted by Mr Maude. Tory officials were quick to deny that the Hague-Portillo-Maude-Widdecombe team is what Labour called \"hardline, rightwing, Euro-sceptic\" by pointing out that Mr Redwood, a Thatcherite, had been dropped. That calculation may have sealed his fate, though he is also seen as a too-visible symbol of the discredited Tory regime. Mr Hague had been planning to bring back Mr Portillo as soon as possible after his by-election victory in Kensington and Chelsea in November, made possible by the death of Alan Clark, whose memorial service Mr Hague attended yesterday. It binds him into the shadow cabinet as it heads for what most analysts believe will be another crushing election defeat - one which Mr Hague may not long survive. Last night Hague aides said it was another strengthening of the party, \"bringing in people of proven ability which intensifies pressure on Tony Blair's failing administration\". Labour replied with some loud raspberries. In a statement Mr Prescott said he had now seen off three shadow spokesmen since 1997 and hoped that Mr Norman \"a director of Railtrack, a hypermarket supremo and a member of Lloyds will be able to bring his experience to bear - provided he can find time to turn up\". Downing Street orchestrated a chorus of jibes against Mr Portillo as a media darling with \"woeful judgement. The public will not forget his record in office\". Hague aides said simply: \"William thought he should put one of our most powerful players against one of theirs.\" Potentially more fruitful was the Liberal Democrats' concentration on Mr Norman's spectacular past as a McKinsey management guru - he hired Mr Hague - who recently sold the Asda supermarket chain (Mr Maude was on the board) to the US giant Walmart. Planning consents from Mr Prescott's department are hugely sensitive. Last night Mr Norman, a less than charismatic Commons performer, said he would \"resolve any potential conflict of interest that might arise\" by bailing out of companies, notably the Knutsford venture capitalist group of which he is a major shareholder, if he has to. With Mr Redwood promising to fight for the Eurosceptic cause on the backbenches, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Alan Beith, said: \"Michael Portillo is now positioned to seize the Tory throne when William Hague falls.\"",

His family was told he was on a far-right death list after clashing with white youths while working as a doorman. Jason McGowan, 20, was found hanging from five-foot high railings by a roadside on New Year's Day. The family said neither had any reason to commit suicide, and that Jason had been investigating his uncle's death when he himself died. Yesterday, however, Jason's father, Robert King, said he continued to believe his son had taken his life, and dismissed as \"lies and rumours\" claims he had been murdered by a racist lynch mob. Jason's mother, Doreen, replied by saying that Mr King, whom she said she had been separated from for almost 15 years, was distant from their son: \"His son got married last summer and he was not even invited to the wedding.\" Jason's uncle, Leroy McGowan, said he believed Mr King had seen his son only twice in the six months before his death, and added that Jason had changed his surname by deedpoll from King to McGowan.

Robert King said he believed that his son, found hanging from railings in Telford on New Year's Day, had committed suicide. Mr King branded as \"lies and rumours\" claims that Jason, 20, had been killed. Jason's death came six months after his uncle, Harold \"Errol\" McGowan, was found hanging in a house in Telford. His family claimed he had been subjected to a racist hate campaign. The McGowans said Jason had been investigating his uncle's death and threats had been received warning the family to stop its inquiries. Yesterday Mr King, a doorman at the Charlton Arms pub in Telford where Harold McGowan had also worked as a bouncer, said the two deaths had been \"manipulated\" to spread rumours that a racist death squad was operating in the Shropshire town. Mr King, 42, said: \"I am his father, I have watched this terrible tragedy unfold from a personal loss of a young much-loved son [and] be manipulated by the press and certain family members into a 'racist lynch mob', connecting it to Errol. \"But why?

      "bodyText": "Government negotiations with Austria's far-right Freedom party were continuing in Vienna last night in the face of controversial threats by all other European Union governments to isolate the Alpine country. With the US joining EU allies in warning Austria not to form a coalition with J\u00f6rg Haider and his colleagues, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, the leader of the conservative People's party, showed no sign of backing down. Sources close to the Austrian president, Thomas Klestil, hinted that an all-party government could be formed, thus minimising the role of the Freedom party, though with 52 seats in the 183-seat parliament, it could not be totally excluded. Austrians were shocked and angered by Monday's unprecedented collective threat from 14 EU capitals to cut off bilateral contacts with Vienna, and there were warnings of a backlash against the EU. But as the political horse-trading drew to a close, the barrage continued across Europe . France's prime minister, Lionel Jospin, yesterday described the Freedom party as a \"xenophobic, far-right\" group. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the German chancellor, insisted: \"If we make it clear that we want nothing to do with politicians like Herr Haider, that is not interfering in another country's affairs. \"It is an expression that we stand for a Europe based on values and that Herr Haider has constantly violated those values.\" Italy's prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, said: \"Europe has certain criteria and values that unite it.\" In the US, a Washington spokesman said: \"The entry of the Freedom party in the Austrian government would affect our bilateral relationship.\" In Brussels, however, the European commission president, Romano Prodi, said that although the commission shared the \"concerns\" of member states, Austria's working relations with the EU were not affected \"at this stage\". There was no disguising the embarrassment about the fact that Mr Prodi had not been consulted when the diplomatic bombshell was dropped. Legally, action has only been taken by individual states, though confusion has arisen over the fact that the warning was issued by Portugal, the current holder of the EU's rotating presidency. Mr Sch\u00fcssel, who is acting foreign minister, said he took international worries seriously, but argued that the best way to counter them was to present a \"reasonable government programme\". Mr Haider is notorious for remarks playing down the crimes of the Nazis, comments for which he has apologised several times. The Freedom party has campaigned against \"overpopulation by foreigners\" and against EU expansion, although its leader says now he supports the principle of enlargement. The Freedom party and the People's party each have 52 seats in the 183-seat parliament after October's inconclusive general election. The caretaker chancellor, Viktor Klima, who heads the Social Democrats, Austria's largest party with 65 seats, tried in vain to put together a grand coalition with Mr Sch\u00fcssel's conservatives.

I can't think of anyone our age who wasn't totally traumatised by the way their mother or father bungled this, the most delicate moment of a child's passage into adulthood. I mean, how would you have liked to be in my shoes? I have the misfortune of coming from a family of mimics. By the time I took my first serious boyfriend home to meet them - and I put it off as long as I could - they could already do his telephone voice perfectly.</p> <p>So I knew there was a danger they might see this meeting as material. Then I said to myself: \"No, how could anyone be so cruel?\" And I walked us right into the trap and spent the next three years paying for it. So, the one thing I'm sure about is that no child of mine is ever going to have to endure that kind of teasing.</p> <p>Neither should they have to endure what my friends and I went through at the hands of our boyfriends' parents. When we exchange memories, we can't decide which parents were worse: the ones who immediately assumed you were destined to carry their grandchildren and looked you up and down like a DNA map, or the ones who had barely finished saying hello when they added: \"I know you've been living together for two years, but I've put you in separate bedrooms at opposite ends of the house.\"</p> <p>That is not to say a kinder reception can't be awful. The biggest welcome I ever got was when I went to meet the parents of a close male friend who had not yet worked up the courage to tell them he was gay. After he saw how happy they were to meet me (and I mean happy - I was this close to getting a free BMW) he lost heart, and decided they would never accept him for what he was. It took him another 10 years to break the news.</p> <p>It would be unfair to hold the parents responsible, coming as they do from a generation that just doesn't have a clue when it comes to teenagers and sex. You can't say the same about our generation, which is why so many of us are so keen to manage this rite of passage with greater sensitivity.</p> <p>My friend Io once went so far as to say that there could be no moment more important. \"Think of it from their point of view,\" she said. \"They must be terrified. The way parents react will determine the quality of the relationship for years to come.\"</p> <p>But that was before the fact, when her sons were still little. They're not any more. The other day, when I asked Io how she met her sons' girlfriends for the first time, her voice, usually so rich and authoritative, grew rather small. \"Oh, it's always the same,\" she said with a nervous laugh. \"It's two heads on the pillow instead of one. A fait accompli!\"</p> <p>After another nervous laugh, she said: \"They always have such blissful expressions on their faces, and that does warm my heart. I do wonder, though, if I'll be quite as light-hearted when it's my daughter in the bed, or if I go into any of their bedrooms and see two heads of the same sex.\"</p> <p>One thing she is sure about: if that moment ever arrived, they would not be embarrassed. Or, for that matter, afraid. As far as I can see, this is the main difference between our generation and theirs. The idea that a parent might be an object of awe has clearly never occurred to them. Here, for example, is how my son introduced me to his first girlfriend.</p> <p>I was sitting in the kitchen late one Sunday morning with my mother, who was visiting, and he just marched into the kitchen with a blanket around his middle instead of pyjamas - and not one, but two girls dressed only in T-shirts. My mother almost had a heart attack. On her behalf, I almost did, too. I tried to imagine what she and my father would have done if I'd done something like this at his age. But I couldn't. It was inconceivable.</p> <p>Later, when I asked my son if, in future, he would mind giving me a little advance notice, his response was: \"Advance notice for what?\" At the time, his question floored me. Now I've heard it so many times, I'm almost numb to it. I mean, I wouldn't even have known my daughter had a boyfriend unless I'd encouraged my son to snoop around and rat on her. I'm not the only one swinging in the wind like this, either. My friends and I talk about it all the time.</p> <p>And then we talk tactics. For my friend Stella, the last straw was when she walked into her son's bedroom one morning, and when the other head on the pillow saw her, she screamed and jumped out of the window. \"I was furious,\" Stella recalls. \"I marched my son downstairs and really gave it to him. I told him he could do what he wanted in his room, but on one condition. He had to make them come in and say hello before they leave. They have to have tea with me, and tell me their name, and act like civilised adults. We are not a brothel! Is that too much to ask?\"</p> <p>Well, I don't think so, but I can't think of a single teenager I know who would agree. Take this close friend of mine, who had been dropping helpful hints and providing easy openings for years without his son giving him the slightest hint about a girlfriend. He was determined to be different from his own father, who had been in the habit of giving his girlfriends a two-second look-over and then assigning them a number between one and 10.</p> <p>When this boy finally told him there was a girlfriend in the picture, and that he was planning to bring her back for the night, he fell over himself assuring his son that he would do everything to make them feel at home. But when the moment arrived for the big introduction, the boy made sure his father was standing on one side of a wall, and the girl on the other. He planted himself in the doorway - that's how determined he was to keep things from getting any more intimate. So forget etiquette. Forget sensitive feelings, and tender rites of passage. When Zara comes home with Angus, Princess Anne should count herself lucky if she even gets to see his face.</p>",

Or, for that matter, afraid. As far as I can see, this is the main difference between our generation and theirs. The idea that a parent might be an object of awe has clearly never occurred to them. Here, for example, is how my son introduced me to his first girlfriend. I was sitting in the kitchen late one Sunday morning with my mother, who was visiting, and he just marched into the kitchen with a blanket around his middle instead of pyjamas - and not one, but two girls dressed only in T-shirts. My mother almost had a heart attack. On her behalf, I almost did, too. I tried to imagine what she and my father would have done if I'd done something like this at his age. But I couldn't. It was inconceivable. Later, when I asked my son if, in future, he would mind giving me a little advance notice, his response was: \"Advance notice for what?\" At the time, his question floored me. Now I've heard it so many times, I'm almost numb to it. I mean, I wouldn't even have known my daughter had a boyfriend unless I'd encouraged my son to snoop around and rat on her. I'm not the only one swinging in the wind like this, either. My friends and I talk about it all the time. And then we talk tactics. For my friend Stella, the last straw was when she walked into her son's bedroom one morning, and when the other head on the pillow saw her, she screamed and jumped out of the window. \"I was furious,\" Stella recalls. \"I marched my son downstairs and really gave it to him. I told him he could do what he wanted in his room, but on one condition. He had to make them come in and say hello before they leave. They have to have tea with me, and tell me their name, and act like civilised adults. We are not a brothel! Is that too much to ask?\" Well, I don't think so, but I can't think of a single teenager I know who would agree. Take this close friend of mine, who had been dropping helpful hints and providing easy openings for years without his son giving him the slightest hint about a girlfriend. He was determined to be different from his own father, who had been in the habit of giving his girlfriends a two-second look-over and then assigning them a number between one and 10. When this boy finally told him there was a girlfriend in the picture, and that he was planning to bring her back for the night, he fell over himself assuring his son that he would do everything to make them feel at home. But when the moment arrived for the big introduction, the boy made sure his father was standing on one side of a wall, and the girl on the other. He planted himself in the doorway - that's how determined he was to keep things from getting any more intimate. So forget etiquette. Forget sensitive feelings, and tender rites of passage. When Zara comes home with Angus, Princess Anne should count herself lucky if she even gets to see his face.",

Do they also call him \"gay\"? </p> <p>Oliver went silent when that question was asked. It was a silence that said \"yes\" more eloquently than the word itself and, furthermore, exposed a dimension of homophobia's power that has barely been acknowledged in the section 28 debate. The point about Oliver is that he has probably never experienced homosexual desire, let alone acted on it. He likes having girls as friends, but if one of his girl friends wanted to become his girlfriend, he wouldn't mind at all. </p> <p>Indeed, he relates the one romantic relationship he has had with a girl, how he'd asked her if she'd mind if he bought some condoms, and even when might be a good time for them to try intercourse. Oliver's crime in the eyes of other boys is not a suspected attraction to boys, but being attracted to girls in the wrong way. For this, Oliver must be punished by being designated \"gay\". </p> <p>Oliver's story has emerged from interviews with dozens of secondary schoolboys aged from 11 to 14 conducted by researchers at the department of psychology at Birkbeck college, University of London.

And because \"femininity\" in a male person is still widely regarded as a sign of homosexuality, any boy who fails to meet the standard of masculine normality becomes vulnerable to homophobic abuse or worse - whatever his sexual preference, imagined or real. The direct and conscious bullying of known or suspected gay children in schools is not, therefore, the only good reason for combating homophobia. The same fearful prejudice also threatens the wellbeing of any boy (or girl) who offends against the conventions of a rigid gender order which boys themselves police with unrelenting rigour. </p> <p>The findings of the Birkbeck team tease out the many subtle and often contradictory ways in which this policing works. Sometimes the consequences for a boy can be directly linked to romance. Oliver observes that being friends with girls appears to rule out any sort of erotic liaison with them; if he asked one of his girl friends out, he says, \"They'd fink that I'd be joking.\" </p> <p>Ironically, though, boys can also find themselves put down as being gay if they associate only with other boys, such as the ones from a boys-only school who reported being taunted by boys who went to mixed schools. In another case, the language of homophobia - the most ubiquitous of pejorative playground terms - was directed at boys who chose to shower communally after PE. Then there were the boys deemed guilty of the girlish crime of having a small number of quiet fellow boy friends, or simply for sitting at the front of class. It seems that almost any way in which a boy differs from loud, \"hard\" or funny boys is likely to make him unpopular, and if unpopular he is a candidate to be denounced as \"poof\", \"wuss\", \"pussy\", \"batty boy\", \"wimp\" or \"queer\". </p> <p>The part played by homophobic attitudes in maintaining a wider regime of gender conformity is acknowledged by Angela Mason, executive director of Stonewall: \"Somehow, among young people, words like 'poof' or 'lezzie' have become generic terms of abuse used against absolutely anybody who is a little bit different,\" she says.

Rob Pattman, the member of the Birkbeck team who did most of the interviews, writes: \"Recognising that homophobia is linked to the idealisation and not just the denigration of girls has important implications in relation to anti-homophobic educational practices with boys.\" Perhaps the key implication is that boys often do value those virtues defined as feminine, yet deny them in themselves and to one another because they fear the label \"queer\". The trick is to help boys acquire cultural permission to value those same virtues. However, as Pattman also observes, the need to encourage this is becoming more urgent as boys take umbrage at girls' burgeoning self-confidence and academic success by retreating still more deeply into machismo. The lesson is clear: boys' desperation to drive out \"the feminine\" extracts a price from all of them, as well as from girls and from any child of either sex who may be gay. It is that same desperation that underpins so much of the behaviour that causes concern over boys, and prevents them from developing the full emotional repertoire they feel is off limits for them. Homophobia is both a cause and a consequence of this sorry deprivation. Those who oppose the repeal of section 28 insist that they're not acting out of prejudice or hate.

And pornography is only the beginning. There is also violence, criminal activity, hate, persecution, drugs, alcohol, gambling and weaponry - all can be blocked by a program called WeBlocker. But for some, even that may not be enough. What about sex education, birth control, abortion, and religion? Or animal rights and militant vegetarianism? </p> <p>Censorship programs try to solve these problems by blocking any site that falls foul of a list of key words, to which you can add your own. They may also block access to a list of \"bad\" sites and allow \"good\" sites. Again, you should be able to add to either list. US civil liberties groups have attacked these for banning legitimate websites, such as the National Organization for Women (for radical lesbianism, apparently) to kids' sports pages (\"12-year-old girls\"). Self-regulation using Pics, Platform for Internet Content Selection, should avoid this. It is built into some browsers including Microsoft's Internet Explorer. In theory, you can set the level of censorship on a 10-point scale. But so few publishers have rated their sites, it's not worth the effort. </p> <p>Alternatively, snoop on your kids and confront them later. Most browsers have snooping facilities built in: just check the \"history\" section for sites visited. Programs such as Kid Control take that idea a lot further, capturing keystrokes so you can look at them later. Kid Control will even store a snapshot of what's on the screen at intervals of 30 seconds to 15 minutes. </p> <p><strong>Net Nanny 3.1 (Net Nanny Software International, $26.95)</strong><br>http://<a href=\"http://www.netnanny.com/\">www.netnanny.com/</a> </p> <p>Looking cuddly got Net Nanny off to a good start, and I was impressed when it objected to some of the file names on my PC's hard disk before I even logged on to the net (it didn't say which). But in use it seemed slow to react, and the lists of banned sites included a lot that didn't work anyway (oh irony - to block porn, you provide a list of porn sites). It also seemed a bit rich to blacklist individual email addresses such as liz@ai.mit.edu (Liz Highleyman from MIT's Artificial Intelligence laboratory) for reasons that were not explained. <br><strong> Rating 3/10</strong> </p> <p><strong>WeBlocker (We-WebCorp.com, no cost)</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.weblocker.com/\">www.weblocker.com/</a> </p> <p>This was the easiest to get working adequately. It lets you select an age range from pre-school to 65+ (handy if your kids are 25-34). It also lets you tick boxes for subjects like drugs, alcohol and gambling. WeBlocker is Draconian: it blocked an educational toy site - The Cabaret Mechanical Theatre (http://<a href=\"http://www.cabaret.co.uk/),\">www.cabaret.co.uk/),</a> in Covent Garden - for gambling; and it censored drug-related parts of a humour magazine. Still, at least it let the kids read Thresh's Firing Squad <a href=\"http://www.firingsquad.com/\">www.firingsquad.com/</a> computer gaming site, for those who are seriously into killing virtual people. <br><strong> Rating 6/10</strong> </p> <p><strong>KidControl (Tybee Software, $29.95)</strong><br>http://<a href=\"http://www.kidcontrol.com/\">www.kidcontrol.com/</a> </p> <p>By being a snoop program rather than censorware, and by avoiding fancy graphics, KidControl has stayed impressively small (817KB). It can hide in the background and keep a log of daily activities on a PC, and can also capture and store screen-shots at pre-set intervals. This is a powerful feature with sites that don't have obvious web addresses like <a href=\"http://www.xxxhardporn.com\">www.xxxhardporn.com</a> Kids can try to evade a keystroke recording system by, for example, copying texts and web addresses from a file and pasting them into the browser, but the visual evidence is incontrovertible. <br><strong> Rating 6/10</strong> </p> <p><strong>Cybersnoop 3.0 (Pearl Software $49.95)</strong><br>http://<a href=\"http://www.pearlsw.com/\">www.pearlsw.com/</a> </p> <p>This is a powerful program, but it's a hefty download (8,117KB) and not the easiest to set up and use. Cybersnoop keeps an audit trail and activity logs, so you know what people have been up to, and it offers access to three blocking system: RSACi (PICS), SafeSurf and Weburbia. You can put extra websites on an allow list or a block list, and Cybersnoop covers email, chat systems, newsgroups and file transfers, too. The only problem is that you may have to get your kids to show you how to use it . . . <br><strong> Rating 5/10</strong> </p> <p><strong>Cyberpatrol 4.0 (The Learning Company $29.95, UKP24.95 UK)</strong><br>http://<a href=\"http://www.cyberpatrol.com/\">www.cyberpatrol.com/</a> </p> <p>This Mac and Windows program is designed to lay down the law in today's wild wild web, and you can even badge a deputy to step in when you're away. The range of blockable topics includes sex education, violence, profanity, and \"satanic or cult\" (Yee har!). However, it costs money to subscribe to the CyberNOT blacklist, which currently has 161,914 entries. Cyberpatrol is always on duty with a time management section that lets you block net access at different times of day, and it can restrict access to 16 different programs, not just the net. Big brother would love it. <br><strong> Rating 6/10</strong> </p> <p><strong>America Online (subscription service)</strong><br> http://<a href=\"http://www.aol.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.aol.com</a> </p> <p>AOL isn't a blocking program, but there's no doubt that its ease of use and \"parental controls\" feature have helped its popularity. Each account can have up to five \"screen names\" so kids can have their own private email, chat and internet access. However, the master account can control access to the various facilities just by clicking in the Parental Controls box. There are pre-sets for Kids Only (under 12), Teen (ages 13-15), Young Adult (ages 16-17), and General Access (ages 18 and older), and they can be fine-tuned. It's like training wheels for the net. <br><strong> Rating 6/10</strong></p>",

US civil liberties groups have attacked these for banning legitimate websites, such as the National Organization for Women (for radical lesbianism, apparently) to kids' sports pages (\"12-year-old girls\"). Self-regulation using Pics, Platform for Internet Content Selection, should avoid this. It is built into some browsers including Microsoft's Internet Explorer. In theory, you can set the level of censorship on a 10-point scale. But so few publishers have rated their sites, it's not worth the effort. Alternatively, snoop on your kids and confront them later. Most browsers have snooping facilities built in: just check the \"history\" section for sites visited. Programs such as Kid Control take that idea a lot further, capturing keystrokes so you can look at them later. Kid Control will even store a snapshot of what's on the screen at intervals of 30 seconds to 15 minutes. Net Nanny 3.1 (Net Nanny Software International, $26.95) http://www.netnanny.com/ Looking cuddly got Net Nanny off to a good start, and I was impressed when it objected to some of the file names on my PC's hard disk before I even logged on to the net (it didn't say which). But in use it seemed slow to react, and the lists of banned sites included a lot that didn't work anyway (oh irony - to block porn, you provide a list of porn sites). It also seemed a bit rich to blacklist individual email addresses such as liz@ai.mit.edu (Liz Highleyman from MIT's Artificial Intelligence laboratory) for reasons that were not explained. Rating 3/10 WeBlocker (We-WebCorp.com, no cost) www.weblocker.com/ This was the easiest to get working adequately. It lets you select an age range from pre-school to 65+ (handy if your kids are 25-34). It also lets you tick boxes for subjects like drugs, alcohol and gambling. WeBlocker is Draconian: it blocked an educational toy site - The Cabaret Mechanical Theatre (http://www.cabaret.co.uk/), in Covent Garden - for gambling; and it censored drug-related parts of a humour magazine. Still, at least it let the kids read Thresh's Firing Squad www.firingsquad.com/ computer gaming site, for those who are seriously into killing virtual people. Rating 6/10 KidControl (Tybee Software, $29.95) http://www.kidcontrol.com/ By being a snoop program rather than censorware, and by avoiding fancy graphics, KidControl has stayed impressively small (817KB). It can hide in the background and keep a log of daily activities on a PC, and can also capture and store screen-shots at pre-set intervals. This is a powerful feature with sites that don't have obvious web addresses like www.xxxhardporn.com Kids can try to evade a keystroke recording system by, for example, copying texts and web addresses from a file and pasting them into the browser, but the visual evidence is incontrovertible. Rating 6/10 Cybersnoop 3.0 (Pearl Software $49.95) http://www.pearlsw.com/ This is a powerful program, but it's a hefty download (8,117KB) and not the easiest to set up and use. Cybersnoop keeps an audit trail and activity logs, so you know what people have been up to, and it offers access to three blocking system: RSACi (PICS), SafeSurf and Weburbia. You can put extra websites on an allow list or a block list, and Cybersnoop covers email, chat systems, newsgroups and file transfers, too. The only problem is that you may have to get your kids to show you how to use it . . . Rating 5/10 Cyberpatrol 4.0 (The Learning Company $29.95, UKP24.95 UK) http://www.cyberpatrol.com/ This Mac and Windows program is designed to lay down the law in today's wild wild web, and you can even badge a deputy to step in when you're away. The range of blockable topics includes sex education, violence, profanity, and \"satanic or cult\" (Yee har!). However, it costs money to subscribe to the CyberNOT blacklist, which currently has 161,914 entries. Cyberpatrol is always on duty with a time management section that lets you block net access at different times of day, and it can restrict access to 16 different programs, not just the net. Big brother would love it. Rating 6/10 America Online (subscription service) http://www.aol.com AOL isn't a blocking program, but there's no doubt that its ease of use and \"parental controls\" feature have helped its popularity. Each account can have up to five \"screen names\" so kids can have their own private email, chat and internet access. However, the master account can control access to the various facilities just by clicking in the Parental Controls box. There are pre-sets for Kids Only (under 12), Teen (ages 13-15), Young Adult (ages 16-17), and General Access (ages 18 and older), and they can be fine-tuned. It's like training wheels for the net.

Tory Leader William Hague said the number of asylum seekers had risen since Labour came to power and that less than a third of the 19,000 people served orders to leave the country last year actually left. \"Decision after decision by his government has weakened the asylum laws,\" he told MPs. \"Some councils now spend more on bogus asylum seekers than they spend on looking after elderly people,\" he added. He quoted home secretary Jack Straw as saying in 1986 that if a labour government did not speed up applications, they would have failed. \"Will you now confirm that the home secretary has failed?\" he demanded.

      "byline": "Cathryn Atkinson",

      "body": "<p>It all began with a few stubborn weeds in a ditch. Percy Schmeiser, a 68-year-old Canadian farmer, was puzzled by the poor result of his annual herbicide spraying in the spring of 1997. As in previous years, he used Roundup, Monsanto's weed killer, to burn off the plants along the outskirts of his 1,400-acre farm near the hamlet of Bruno, in Saskatchewan. </p> <p>Despite saturating the area with herbicide, he found rogue oilseed rape plants thriving in ditches and around telephone poles. Having crossbred his own seed for 35 years, he wondered if he had accidentally created some kind of mutant. </p> <p>So he sprayed Roundup from the edge of his field inward, a full 80 feet into his own flourishing crop of oilseed rape. It should have killed everything but, to his alarm, over 60% of the plants survived. Only Roundup Ready oilseed rape - genetically modified by Monsanto to create a mutually exclusive relationship between their seeds and their herbicide - can survive. </p> <p>Some time later, Monsanto was tipped off by a call to its (now defunct) freephone \"sneak\" line that Schmeiser was, allegedly, growing Roundup Ready GM oilseed rape. Monsanto asked Robinson Investigations, retained by them throughout Canada to gather information on errant farmers, to take samples from the Schmeiser farm. </p> <p>Schmeiser's crop possessed Monsanto's gene, and Robinson's also visited the local mill, which chemically cleaned Schmeiser's seeds for planting, to retrieve a sample. Again, the gene was found. </p> <p>Although Schmeiser says he had never bought seed from Monsanto or signed a contract, the corporation sued him for cultivating their gene, demanding all profits from the crop and unspecified punitive damages. Schmeiser argued that any number of potential contaminants could have infiltrated his seed - such as blow-offs from passing trucks laden with Roundup Ready oilseed rape, insects, wind or cross-germination, - and that further contamination could have occurred when he kept back seed to plant. </p> <p>Last August, the two parties met to resolve the dispute. They failed, so Monsanto's case now goes to the supreme court of Canada in June. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a furious Schmeiser has launched a suit against them, for allegedly contaminating his seed stock, for defamation and trespass, and the theft of seeds and plants. He is asking for punitive damages of C$10m (\u00a34.2m). </p> <p>Schmeiser is one of more than 1,000 Canadian farmers investigated by Monsanto in the past three years for allegedly growing its patented GM crops and breaking the conditions of the company's technology use agreement (TUA). This gives the farmers the right, for a price of \u00a36.30 an acre, to grow GM crops, and allows Monsanto unlimited access to their fields, seed stores and crops for up to three years. Farmers must also agree to destroy any leftover seed each year in order to protect Monsanto's patent. If they wish to buy the seed the following year, they must sign the TUA and again pay the fee. </p> <p>Monsanto say that 400,000 North American farmers have signed the TUA (20,000 in Canada) and over 17 million acres in Canada and 62 million in the US were covered by Monsanto's GM seed by 1999. </p> <p>Monsanto Canada's Adele Pelland says 65% of the oilseed rape grown in Canada in 1999 was Roundup Ready, and stresses that farmers encourage Monsanto to prosecute under the TUA, adding that they \"all want a level playing field\". </p> <p>Schmeiser's case is gaining worldwide attention, but it is, perhaps, most closely watched by those farmers who fear Monsanto's legal wrath for violations of the TUA. A new term, \"bio-serfdom\", has entered the Canadian prairie lexicon. </p> <p>Edward Zielinski traded wheat seed for canola seed with another farmer in 1997. Unknown to him, the canola he planted on his farm in Mikado, Saskatchewan was contaminated with Roundup Ready seed. Monsanto set his fine at C$115 (\u00a348.32) an acre or C$28,750 (\u00a312,079). He has no intention of paying, arguing that farmers have traded seed for centuries. </p> <p>And 400 miles east, in Arden, Manitoba, Ed Sulz is facing ruin. As a strong supporter of GM crops, he very much wanted to test Roundup Ready oilseed rape. In 1996, he was one of the first farmers in western Canada to try. The seed dealer asked him to sign the TUA. Having left his cheque book at home, Sulz left with the seed, but without the document. \"I just initialled it (the TUA) and said I'd get the cheque to him,\" he says. Once the dealer received the cheque, the TUA was faxed to Sulz, but since the terms and conditions were on the back of the page, he never received a copy outlining its vital stipulations. </p> <p>When, the following spring, Sulz had enough seed left over to plant a further 75 acres, he did so in ignorance of the conditions of his contract. Monsanto's crop cops were on to him by July, faxing a letter outlining the transgression and demanding \u00a3141,807 in fines. They included a copy of terms and conditions. </p> <p>\"The investigator said I had to sign the fax as proof that he had delivered it, so I initialled it,\" says Sulz. Five days later, two official copies of the letter arrived by post. But, with time to reflect, Sulz changed his mind and offered to pay the TUA fee of C$1,125 (\u00a3473) for the 75 acres in the hope of settling the dispute. Monsanto took this payment but rejected settlement, stating that the initials on the fax were legal and binding. </p> <p>The company took Sulz to court in December 1998, but the judge called their fine \"outrageous\" and rejected the initialled fax as a legal document. Monsanto is now appealing and Sulz has launched a counter-suit, but with legal fees of at least $100,000 before getting to court, he cannot afford to continue. </p> <p>Ironically, Sulz remains a supporter of GM. He has grown GM canola produced by other bio-agricultural companies in the past two years, but is now considering a change to organic farming because of the backlash against GM food. </p> <p>Since April, the price of oilseed rape has dropped from C$9 to C$4 a bushel.

      "bodyText": "It all began with a few stubborn weeds in a ditch. Percy Schmeiser, a 68-year-old Canadian farmer, was puzzled by the poor result of his annual herbicide spraying in the spring of 1997. As in previous years, he used Roundup, Monsanto's weed killer, to burn off the plants along the outskirts of his 1,400-acre farm near the hamlet of Bruno, in Saskatchewan. Despite saturating the area with herbicide, he found rogue oilseed rape plants thriving in ditches and around telephone poles. Having crossbred his own seed for 35 years, he wondered if he had accidentally created some kind of mutant. So he sprayed Roundup from the edge of his field inward, a full 80 feet into his own flourishing crop of oilseed rape. It should have killed everything but, to his alarm, over 60% of the plants survived. Only Roundup Ready oilseed rape - genetically modified by Monsanto to create a mutually exclusive relationship between their seeds and their herbicide - can survive. Some time later, Monsanto was tipped off by a call to its (now defunct) freephone \"sneak\" line that Schmeiser was, allegedly, growing Roundup Ready GM oilseed rape. Monsanto asked Robinson Investigations, retained by them throughout Canada to gather information on errant farmers, to take samples from the Schmeiser farm. Schmeiser's crop possessed Monsanto's gene, and Robinson's also visited the local mill, which chemically cleaned Schmeiser's seeds for planting, to retrieve a sample. Again, the gene was found. Although Schmeiser says he had never bought seed from Monsanto or signed a contract, the corporation sued him for cultivating their gene, demanding all profits from the crop and unspecified punitive damages. Schmeiser argued that any number of potential contaminants could have infiltrated his seed - such as blow-offs from passing trucks laden with Roundup Ready oilseed rape, insects, wind or cross-germination, - and that further contamination could have occurred when he kept back seed to plant. Last August, the two parties met to resolve the dispute. They failed, so Monsanto's case now goes to the supreme court of Canada in June. Meanwhile, a furious Schmeiser has launched a suit against them, for allegedly contaminating his seed stock, for defamation and trespass, and the theft of seeds and plants. He is asking for punitive damages of C$10m (\u00a34.2m). Schmeiser is one of more than 1,000 Canadian farmers investigated by Monsanto in the past three years for allegedly growing its patented GM crops and breaking the conditions of the company's technology use agreement (TUA). This gives the farmers the right, for a price of \u00a36.30 an acre, to grow GM crops, and allows Monsanto unlimited access to their fields, seed stores and crops for up to three years. Farmers must also agree to destroy any leftover seed each year in order to protect Monsanto's patent. If they wish to buy the seed the following year, they must sign the TUA and again pay the fee. Monsanto say that 400,000 North American farmers have signed the TUA (20,000 in Canada) and over 17 million acres in Canada and 62 million in the US were covered by Monsanto's GM seed by 1999. Monsanto Canada's Adele Pelland says 65% of the oilseed rape grown in Canada in 1999 was Roundup Ready, and stresses that farmers encourage Monsanto to prosecute under the TUA, adding that they \"all want a level playing field\". Schmeiser's case is gaining worldwide attention, but it is, perhaps, most closely watched by those farmers who fear Monsanto's legal wrath for violations of the TUA. A new term, \"bio-serfdom\", has entered the Canadian prairie lexicon. Edward Zielinski traded wheat seed for canola seed with another farmer in 1997. Unknown to him, the canola he planted on his farm in Mikado, Saskatchewan was contaminated with Roundup Ready seed. Monsanto set his fine at C$115 (\u00a348.32) an acre or C$28,750 (\u00a312,079). He has no intention of paying, arguing that farmers have traded seed for centuries. And 400 miles east, in Arden, Manitoba, Ed Sulz is facing ruin. As a strong supporter of GM crops, he very much wanted to test Roundup Ready oilseed rape. In 1996, he was one of the first farmers in western Canada to try. The seed dealer asked him to sign the TUA. Having left his cheque book at home, Sulz left with the seed, but without the document. \"I just initialled it (the TUA) and said I'd get the cheque to him,\" he says. Once the dealer received the cheque, the TUA was faxed to Sulz, but since the terms and conditions were on the back of the page, he never received a copy outlining its vital stipulations. When, the following spring, Sulz had enough seed left over to plant a further 75 acres, he did so in ignorance of the conditions of his contract. Monsanto's crop cops were on to him by July, faxing a letter outlining the transgression and demanding \u00a3141,807 in fines. They included a copy of terms and conditions. \"The investigator said I had to sign the fax as proof that he had delivered it, so I initialled it,\" says Sulz. Five days later, two official copies of the letter arrived by post. But, with time to reflect, Sulz changed his mind and offered to pay the TUA fee of C$1,125 (\u00a3473) for the 75 acres in the hope of settling the dispute. Monsanto took this payment but rejected settlement, stating that the initials on the fax were legal and binding. The company took Sulz to court in December 1998, but the judge called their fine \"outrageous\" and rejected the initialled fax as a legal document. Monsanto is now appealing and Sulz has launched a counter-suit, but with legal fees of at least $100,000 before getting to court, he cannot afford to continue. Ironically, Sulz remains a supporter of GM. He has grown GM canola produced by other bio-agricultural companies in the past two years, but is now considering a change to organic farming because of the backlash against GM food. Since April, the price of oilseed rape has dropped from C$9 to C$4 a bushel. And Eastern Manitoban farmers say they are losing up to C$10 a tonne because Europe and an increasing number of companies won't buy it. Buyers are now paying a premium for crops guaranteed non-GM. And a recently launched anti-GM food initiative, led by the respected biotechnology scientist Dr David Suzuki, is leading the growing debate in Canada. \u0095 For more details on Percy Schmeiser's case against Monsanto visit: www.fightfrankenfood.com",

      "body": "<p>Last month's emergency in Venezuela is a reminder not only that such disasters seem to be happening more frequently but also that most are never fully solved. I recently revisited the scene of a similar Latin American disaster - the area hit in October 1998 by Hurricane Mitch. As in Venezuela, in the Posoltega district of Nicaragua a mud slide did the most spectacular damage, killing 2,500 people, rendering 5,000 homeless and devastating farmland. </p> <p>Hurricane Mitch provoked a massive response, with more than \u00a310 million raised in private donations in Britain alone. Five months after the disaster President Clinton himself visited Posoltega, met hurricane victims and promised help. A major conference took place last year in Stockholm to coordinate aid and debt-relief to the four most affected central American countries. </p> <p>Approaching Posoltega on the main highway, the scars created by the mud slide are being covered by vegetation, all but one of the bridges swept away in floods have been replaced, and the road itself is new. But the changes are superficial. A talk to the mayor, Felicita Zeledon, quickly establishes that this is a community struggling to find a future for itself. Most of the 1,000 or more displaced families will soon have houses, but what they lack is the means to support themselves. Some have already left the area or even emigrated to seek work elsewhere; the majority can only find casual jobs and a few have returned to farm the very slopes that remain unstable on the side of the volcano. </p> <p>Posoltega has seen little help from the Nicaraguan government or indeed from the US (despite the Clinton visit). The aid from international agencies has built houses but is not providing the land which the people need to feed themselves. The cost of land has rocketed and this has put off agencies unwilling to pay high prices. The government has refused to intervene and buy land. </p> <p>The problems of drainage, soil stability and effective monitor-ing of seismic dangers are still unresolved. As if to remind those living in this hazardous area of the dangers they face, while I was there the neighbouring Concepcion volcano began throwing large boulders into the air. </p> <p>Medical agencies have helped hurricane victims deal with the trauma of the disaster and the loss of loved ones, but such problems are not solved quickly and the agencies have now moved on. Se\u00f1ora Zeledon is trying to fill the gaps, but the devastated local economy is paying fewer taxes than before. Her town hall has received no extra government funding and expectations far exceed results. </p> <p>I managed to track down a woman called Inez Vanegas, about whom I wrote in this diary column a year ago. She lives with her children in a plastic-walled shelter about 12 metres square with a dirt floor, in a camp provided by the Spanish Red Cross. She now has a few clothes and other belongings to replace what was lost. She is waiting for one of the new houses being built, but each has only a tiny piece of land - insufficient to plant crops. She borrowed $30 to buy hens, and is struggling to pay it back. Casual work is available on local farms, but only in return for food - not cash.

      "bodyText": "Last month's emergency in Venezuela is a reminder not only that such disasters seem to be happening more frequently but also that most are never fully solved. I recently revisited the scene of a similar Latin American disaster - the area hit in October 1998 by Hurricane Mitch. As in Venezuela, in the Posoltega district of Nicaragua a mud slide did the most spectacular damage, killing 2,500 people, rendering 5,000 homeless and devastating farmland. Hurricane Mitch provoked a massive response, with more than \u00a310 million raised in private donations in Britain alone. Five months after the disaster President Clinton himself visited Posoltega, met hurricane victims and promised help. A major conference took place last year in Stockholm to coordinate aid and debt-relief to the four most affected central American countries. Approaching Posoltega on the main highway, the scars created by the mud slide are being covered by vegetation, all but one of the bridges swept away in floods have been replaced, and the road itself is new. But the changes are superficial. A talk to the mayor, Felicita Zeledon, quickly establishes that this is a community struggling to find a future for itself. Most of the 1,000 or more displaced families will soon have houses, but what they lack is the means to support themselves. Some have already left the area or even emigrated to seek work elsewhere; the majority can only find casual jobs and a few have returned to farm the very slopes that remain unstable on the side of the volcano. Posoltega has seen little help from the Nicaraguan government or indeed from the US (despite the Clinton visit). The aid from international agencies has built houses but is not providing the land which the people need to feed themselves. The cost of land has rocketed and this has put off agencies unwilling to pay high prices. The government has refused to intervene and buy land. The problems of drainage, soil stability and effective monitor-ing of seismic dangers are still unresolved. As if to remind those living in this hazardous area of the dangers they face, while I was there the neighbouring Concepcion volcano began throwing large boulders into the air. Medical agencies have helped hurricane victims deal with the trauma of the disaster and the loss of loved ones, but such problems are not solved quickly and the agencies have now moved on. Se\u00f1ora Zeledon is trying to fill the gaps, but the devastated local economy is paying fewer taxes than before. Her town hall has received no extra government funding and expectations far exceed results. I managed to track down a woman called Inez Vanegas, about whom I wrote in this diary column a year ago. She lives with her children in a plastic-walled shelter about 12 metres square with a dirt floor, in a camp provided by the Spanish Red Cross. She now has a few clothes and other belongings to replace what was lost. She is waiting for one of the new houses being built, but each has only a tiny piece of land - insufficient to plant crops. She borrowed $30 to buy hens, and is struggling to pay it back. Casual work is available on local farms, but only in return for food - not cash. And because the rest of her family died, there is no one with whom to leave the children if she does find work. Her 12-year-old daughter carries the wounds from being hit by a tree in the mud slide, and recently had an operation to remove a piece of barbed wire from near her spine. But the psychological problems are deeper. She suffers from fits in which she seems about to die. The community collected $300 towards her medical costs, but she clearly needs longer-term help and there is now no one to give it. That the survivors have preserved their lives, but have yet to find a viable future, is brought home by the isolated location of the refugee camp and the nearby new homes. Miles from the nearest town, one mile even from the main road and served only by a dirt track, the well-built but small houses with few community facilities await their unwilling owners. They seem to symbolise a community which has lost its purpose. Inez smiles when she recollects how lucky she and her children were to escape the mud. But as the land turns green again, it fails to bring her any hope. \u0095 John Perry is director of policy at the Chartered Institute of Housing.",

      "body": "<p>There is a dramatic staffing crisis in social care, probably worse than at any time since the war, that will leave local authorities unable to provide support for thousands of elderly and vulnerable people and children unless urgent action is taken within the next few months, say employers and training chiefs. </p> <p>There have been concerns about falling numbers of social work students for some time. Last week, Essex county council confirmed managers were recruiting social workers from as far away as South Africa in a bid to fill empty posts. In addition, councils are struggling to attract or retain the mainstay of the workforce - mature women - as residential and home care workers. </p> <p>Out of town superstores, the scourge of the high street retailer, are also hitting social care economy. The opening of a new Tesco is often accompanied by a mass exodus of social care staff as they quit for the less stressful - and mostly better paid - world of retail. </p> <p>According to Peter Gilroy, strategic director responsible for social services for Kent, one of the country's largest purchasers of care, a few years ago when home care meant a bit of housework and cooking, women were happy to take the jobs which then fitted in with school hours. Now demands made on staff are greater, service users need a higher level of care and have greater needs and require round the clock support. </p> <p>\"Our aspirations for the homecare workforce - better trained and more skilled - is not matched by the money on offer,\" he says. \"They can earn \u00a36.25 an hour in Tesco in Kent. Social care wages for part-time and unqualified staff range from the minimum wage up to \u00a35 per hour.\" </p> <p>In many areas, councils are also struggling to recruit qualified social workers. Kent has recruited from New Zealand, Australia and the Republic of Ireland for some time. Developments like the Quality Protects initiative, which aims to raise standards in children's services, have created more posts and led to councils poaching each other's staff to fill them. </p> <p>Jennifer Bernard, chief executive of the social work training council, CCETSW, sees more problems on the horizon. \"Because of the age profile of the workforce, we are expecting a large bulk of retirements soon, and not enough are coming forward to take their places,\" she says. </p> <p>The number of students applying for social work courses fell by 55% between 1995 and 1999. Social work courses tend to attract older people; the average age of someone finishing a diploma in social work is in the mid-30s.

      "bodyText": "There is a dramatic staffing crisis in social care, probably worse than at any time since the war, that will leave local authorities unable to provide support for thousands of elderly and vulnerable people and children unless urgent action is taken within the next few months, say employers and training chiefs. There have been concerns about falling numbers of social work students for some time. Last week, Essex county council confirmed managers were recruiting social workers from as far away as South Africa in a bid to fill empty posts. In addition, councils are struggling to attract or retain the mainstay of the workforce - mature women - as residential and home care workers. Out of town superstores, the scourge of the high street retailer, are also hitting social care economy. The opening of a new Tesco is often accompanied by a mass exodus of social care staff as they quit for the less stressful - and mostly better paid - world of retail. According to Peter Gilroy, strategic director responsible for social services for Kent, one of the country's largest purchasers of care, a few years ago when home care meant a bit of housework and cooking, women were happy to take the jobs which then fitted in with school hours. Now demands made on staff are greater, service users need a higher level of care and have greater needs and require round the clock support. \"Our aspirations for the homecare workforce - better trained and more skilled - is not matched by the money on offer,\" he says. \"They can earn \u00a36.25 an hour in Tesco in Kent. Social care wages for part-time and unqualified staff range from the minimum wage up to \u00a35 per hour.\" In many areas, councils are also struggling to recruit qualified social workers. Kent has recruited from New Zealand, Australia and the Republic of Ireland for some time. Developments like the Quality Protects initiative, which aims to raise standards in children's services, have created more posts and led to councils poaching each other's staff to fill them. Jennifer Bernard, chief executive of the social work training council, CCETSW, sees more problems on the horizon. \"Because of the age profile of the workforce, we are expecting a large bulk of retirements soon, and not enough are coming forward to take their places,\" she says. The number of students applying for social work courses fell by 55% between 1995 and 1999. Social work courses tend to attract older people; the average age of someone finishing a diploma in social work is in the mid-30s. The switch from grants to student loans is believed to have acted as a major disincentive to mature students, who may have families and mortgages and are reluctant to take on new debts. When the Tories were in power the then health secretary, Virginia Bottomley, famously called for armies of streetwise grannies to enter social work. Now may be the time to challenge the assumption that older people are the best social workers, says Bernard. \"Young people, too, need to see social care as a positive career choice,\" she says. Social work's image problem is also contributing to the recruitment difficulties. Countless inquiries and scandals have rightly highlighted bad practice and mistakes, but not enough has been done to promote social work as a satisfying and rewarding career, says Tony Smith, of the local government group, the Improvement and Development Agency. Ian White, director of Hertfordshire social services, points out that, in a booming economy, people have more jobs to choose from and leave the sector \"because they are worn down by the sheer intractability of some of the work\". Smith adds that the fact that the majority of social care staff are unqualified speaks volumes \"about the value that is attached to the workforce\". There are moves afoot to market social care in a more positive light. Last month, the health minister, John Hutton, announced the winners of the first social care awards scheme.

      "body": "<p>At the end of the funeral, the family requested the Vera Lynn song, We'll Meet Again. \"Of course, as humanists, we don't believe we will,\" says Ted Stroud, one of about 170 non-religious officiants in the UK presiding over atheist funerals, baby-naming ceremonies and weddings. \"But we respected their wishes.\" </p> <p>Each year, the number of humanist ceremonies goes up. Yet they are still pitifully few. The national secular movement, which once boasted a hall in every large town in Britain, has shrunk to a tiny cluster of full-time atheists and their supporters, working and campaigning out of their historic base in Holborn, central London. For a society which often remarks on its own godlessness, we are curiously reluctant to stand up and declare how godless we are. </p> <p>It is a fact that organised religion has never had it so bad. Only 3.7 million people now regularly attend church on Sunday; anecdotally, mosques and synagogues have the same problems of declining attendance and ageing congregations. The country ought to be fertile territory for organised atheism. But it isn't. </p> <p>As the tide of religious observance has retreated, the humanists have retreated in step. Instead of embracing atheism after renouncing regular worship of God, Britons have lapsed into a Hollywood-fuelled dalliance with non-threatening ghosts and angels, an occasional nod to God at weddings or on Christmas Eve, and an all-embracing metaphysics which encourages any religion to speak without being heard. In politics, Anglo-Catholic Tories square off against Christian Socialist Labour. </p> <p>\"Paradoxically, religious influence in public life - now at its highest for a generation or more - seems to have risen in inverse proportion to the decline in Christianity,\" says Keith Porteous Wood, general secretary of the National Secular Society. \"One gets the impression that non-religious views are off-message in New Labour, and I've yet to meet a Conservative politician who will tell me on the record that they don't believe. It's much easier for a member of parliament to come out as gay than come out as an atheist. That suggests we have a very long way to go.\" </p> <p>Parents who would recoil from the thought of getting up every Sunday morning to eat and drink the flesh and blood of Christ in a draughty stone hall still baptise their children and fight tooth and nail to get them into the growing number of church schools. Voters who would flee from a party which pledged to rule Britain in accordance with biblical law shrug at the presence of unelected bishops in the House of Lords and acknowledge the existence of God from the first word of the national anthem. </p> <p>\"I think an awful lot of people are humanists without being aware of it,\" says Marilyn Mason, education officer at the British Humanist Association. \"They don't call themselves humanists and they don't feel any need to join a humanist association. Humanism is essentially an intellectual commitment which can be made in private, without joining anything. That's our problem, really.\" </p> <p>The public, popular face of humanism has ridden a bell curve since 1842, when George Holyoake, a powerful campaigner for secularism, became the last person in England to be imprisoned for being an atheist. His crime was to declare at a public meeting in Cheltenham, at a time of recession and spending cuts: \"If I could have my way, I would place the deity on half pay as the government of this country did its subaltern officers.\" </p> <p>As the 19th century wore on and the ideas of Charles Darwin and sceptical German theologians began to eat into the certainties of Christian faith, Holyoake and the founder of the National Secular Society, Charles Bradlaugh, toured the country, addressing crowds of thousands of people at tumultuous meetings which could last for days. The authorities, eager to shore up the ideological might of the then powerful Church of England, fought them every inch of the way. At one point, Bradlaugh addressed an audience from a barge moored a few feet off Devonport so as to be outside the jurisdiction of the local police. </p> <p>Now-forgotten battles followed over universal access to contraception and the rights of non-Christian families to adopt; in the first half of the last century, engaged atheist philosophers such as Bertrand Russell and AJ Ayer took up the baton of crusading humanism. </p> <p>What remains of a once-mighty movement, further winnowed by the tarnishing of atheist socialism's reputation in Stalin and Brezhnev's USSR, is spread between a group of organisations based in and around Red Lion Square in Holborn. </p> <p>There is the South Place Ethical Society, owner of the Conway Hall, one of the last big venues for public meetings in the centre of the capital. They have only 350 members. </p> <p>The British Humanist Association, round the corner in Theobald's Road, claims around 3,600, with two dozen affiliates countrywide. </p> <p>Silence should not be taken as an admission of despair, but the third bastion of British atheism, the National Secular Society, refuses to discuss membership at all. </p> <p>\"I think the church and us have one problem in common,\" says Porteous Wood. \"Young people and, as society goes on, people in general aren't interested in joining organisations, especially those with a moral or political dimension. There isn't the kind of communal idealism we saw at the turn of the previous century. </p> <p>\"I'm not going around trying to change people who believe. All I'm trying to do is make sure that what the religions are doing is not impinging on other people.\" </p> <p>The humanist organisations don't lack prominent supporters. Among the honorary associates of the NSS are Iain Banks, Francis Crick, Richard Dawkins, Michael Foot, Ludovic Kennedy, George Melly, Jonathan Miller, Harold Pinter and Claire Rayner. What seems to be missing is the zealous footsoldiers to campaign on issues like the blurring of religion and ethics in the classroom. </p> <p>Campus philosophers, too, are conspicuous by their reluctance to apply their disdain for religion to real life. \"Philosophy departments are sometimes a little bit unwilling to participate in public debate, to try to live by their philosophies or even to admit they have any great contribution to make to the way we live,\" says Mason. </p> <p>The BHA is trying to set up a philosophers' think tank to counter the pronouncements of religious leaders on moral issues. It takes comfort from polls showing that 40% of under-35s don't believe in God and almost two-thirds of teenagers aged 13 to 15 call themselves atheist or agnostic. </p> <p>Yet polls can be fickle, and on issues of belief, it seems, the nature of the question and the context can cause particularly wild statistical swings. One 1999 survey found that 67% of people believed in God. </p> <p>One problem for the atheists is that, much as priests may rant against the materialist society, it actually favours their vision of an afterlife. The more people come to value their possessions, personal identity and consumer comforts, the harder it is to imagine them vanishing into nothing. It is easy to see why the faint hope of a benign - or at least interesting - afterlife is more attractive than the certainty of nothingness after death. It's like the difference between having a one in 20 million chance of winning the lottery and not having a lottery ticket at all. </p> <p>Another problem, pointed out by Jennifer Jeynes, of the South Place Ethical Society, is that humanists -by their very nature - are freethinkers. They don't want to bully people. </p> <p>\"We don't want to browbeat people into belief or frighten them with ideas of hell,\" she says. \"That's part of the way the church became powerful in this country. Our aim is to make everybody's life as fulfilling as possible and not look for rewards in heaven. </p> <p>\"Part of the problem is that people aren't too interested in thinking, in intellectual pursuits. I think we've become a more pictorial age.\" </p> <p> The growth in demand for non-religious ceremonies is, for now, the only sign that atheism as a worked-out ideology has a grip on British society. Last year, through its network of trained celebrants, the BHA arranged more than 2,500 funerals (24% up on the previous year), 200 weddings and 150 baby-naming ceremonies. </p> <p>Of the baby-namings, Alan Marshall, a London humanist celebrant, says: \"We will provide a solemn and dignified centrepiece to a family piss-up. It should be a party atmosphere but with just that little moment in the middle of the party when there's a moment of seriousness.\" </p> <p>The funerals are correspondingly more sober. For an \u00a380 fee, a BHA celebrant will interview the family of the deceased and compose a funeral oration. Dressed in ordinary black clothes, the celebrant introduces the occasion, makes a speech honouring the dead person's life, calls for a few minutes' reflection and, after the commital of the body, says a few concluding words. </p> <p>\"We don't just take a book off the shelf like a vicar does,\" says Marshall. \"Each one is a piece of creative writing, and that takes a lot of time and mental energy.\" </p> <p>The lack of atheist \"converts\", he says, is only natural; after all, people who aren't Manchester United fans don't feel that they need to join the Not Manchester United fan club. Marshall says: \"People never see a reason to join up for something just because they're not members of something else.\"</p>",

Nadia glances at the cover. \"What's that girl's name again?\" \"Lara Croft.\" Nadia smiles. \"Do you like her then?\" \"She's alright.\" Nadia gives him a playful nudge in the ribs. The pair of them start laughing. \"You've got to get some rest,\" she insists. \"What are you doing tomorrow?\" \"Going to the football match with me dad.\" \"That'll be nice. You'll need all the rest you can get then.\" She moves towards the doorway. \"Come on. Put your head down.\" See also: Don't Bother To Knock Don't see also: Jack and Sarah, Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead, The Crazysitter Pointless trivia: Gina McKee made her screen debut in the 1985 TV comedy series An Actor's Life For Me",

But he added that Britain was unlikely to join the euro - which was performing \"spectacularly badly\" - because the European exchange rate \"will almost certainly not be right for Britain all of the time\".</p> <p>\"People who favour the euro say that these constitutional implications can be handled, that they are not as important as we think they might be,\" Mr Portillo told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"I think this is where people are driven mad by the government - the government pretending that if control of monetary policy passes away from Britain, that that doesn't have constitutional implications. Of course it does.\"</p> <p>He defended the party's current position, saying: \"What William Hague has said - with commendable modesty - is, 'Alright, I am prepared to believe that one day you might be able to resolve these problems. I can't see how you could, but what's for sure is that all these problems couldn't be sorted out in the coming parliament.'</p> <p>\"The proper position is for us in the next manifesto to be against the euro, so that people know that if they want to save the pound, there is only one way to do it and that is to vote for the Conservative Party.\"</p> <p>After his return to parliament in the Kensington and Chelsea by-election two months ago, Mr Portillo would have been happy to remain on the backbenchers, Mr Portillo said. But his friendship with Mr Hague meant that he was \"obviously pleased but perhaps not quite as surprised as some other people\". He was \"very pleased and very flattered and delighted to be in the Hague team\".</p> <p>He backed Mr Hague's promises to cut taxes and increase spending on public services in the next Tory administration. \"The burden of taxation can be reduced as long as you don't have a profligate government.</p> <p>\"When the economy is growing, why does the government feel that it has got to help itself to the same proportion of the increase in wealth and take more money out of people's pockets? If you have a government that is careful with taxpayers' money, that won't happen.\"</p> <p>Former Asda supermarket chairman Archie Norman has taken over Mr Redwood's former job, but faces problems divesting of potential conflicts of interests in his business dealings. Shadow chancellor Francis Maude moves to foreign affairs.</p> <p>Mr Redwood let it be known he took more than 100 calls from Conservative MPs on Tuesday night, all offering support.</p> <p>Education and employment secretary David Blunkett said the new Tory team was the most right-wing group ever to have held the top jobs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Michael Portillo sealed his comeback to the Tory front bench today with a declaration of loyalty to the leader many people believe he wants to replace. The new shadow chancellor said he had been \"building up quite a friendship\" with Conservative leader William Hague over recent years. \"It has been a strengthening relationship,\" Mr Portillo. \"I don't know two Conservatives who think more closely together.\" Mr Hague dramatically brought in the former defence secretary to his team last night in a mini-reshuffle which also saw the sacking of environment spokesman John Redwood and shadow foreign secretary John Maples. Mr Portillo, who might well have become Tory leader after the last election if he had not lost his Enfield Southgate seat, denied that his new job - effectively number two in the shadow cabinet -was \"a poisoned chalice\". Though he has been more hardline in his opposition to a European single currency than Mr Hague, who has only ruled out joining for the duration of the next parliament, Mr Portillo said his views on the euro were \"entirely consistent\" with his leader. But he added that Britain was unlikely to join the euro - which was performing \"spectacularly badly\" - because the European exchange rate \"will almost certainly not be right for Britain all of the time\". \"People who favour the euro say that these constitutional implications can be handled, that they are not as important as we think they might be,\" Mr Portillo told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"I think this is where people are driven mad by the government - the government pretending that if control of monetary policy passes away from Britain, that that doesn't have constitutional implications. Of course it does.\" He defended the party's current position, saying: \"What William Hague has said - with commendable modesty - is, 'Alright, I am prepared to believe that one day you might be able to resolve these problems. I can't see how you could, but what's for sure is that all these problems couldn't be sorted out in the coming parliament.' \"The proper position is for us in the next manifesto to be against the euro, so that people know that if they want to save the pound, there is only one way to do it and that is to vote for the Conservative Party.\" After his return to parliament in the Kensington and Chelsea by-election two months ago, Mr Portillo would have been happy to remain on the backbenchers, Mr Portillo said. But his friendship with Mr Hague meant that he was \"obviously pleased but perhaps not quite as surprised as some other people\". He was \"very pleased and very flattered and delighted to be in the Hague team\". He backed Mr Hague's promises to cut taxes and increase spending on public services in the next Tory administration. \"The burden of taxation can be reduced as long as you don't have a profligate government. \"When the economy is growing, why does the government feel that it has got to help itself to the same proportion of the increase in wealth and take more money out of people's pockets? If you have a government that is careful with taxpayers' money, that won't happen.\" Former Asda supermarket chairman Archie Norman has taken over Mr Redwood's former job, but faces problems divesting of potential conflicts of interests in his business dealings. Shadow chancellor Francis Maude moves to foreign affairs. Mr Redwood let it be known he took more than 100 calls from Conservative MPs on Tuesday night, all offering support. Education and employment secretary David Blunkett said the new Tory team was the most right-wing group ever to have held the top jobs.",

McLynn continues the tradition of young women who have kick-started their careers by playing dotty old dames: Julie Walters' Mrs Overall, Caroline Aherne's Mrs Merton. After three series of loyal service to Father Ted, it is starting to pay off. </p> <p>She can currently be seen in Angela's Ashes, playing Aunt Aggie, but more importantly has a first novel out this week and is writing a second. Something for the Weekend is a pastiche of several styles that tells of a 30-year-old private detective from Dublin on the trail of a philandering aristocrat.

Her aversion to purple prose is a theme to which she frequently returns. \"I love reading novels and I tried to write the sort of book that I like to read.\" </p> <p>It had not been her lifelong ambition to write; she didn't fret away at the manuscript for years. McLynn looked around her, noted the number of actors - including Father Ted co-star Ardal O'Hanlon - who were knocking out novels, and thought, \"Damn, I could do that.\" And she did. \"I just had a go. I did it to see if I could. Then the publishing deal got done and that was even better because I love a deadline.\" </p> <p>McLynn settled down at her laptop and, with businesslike application, wrote up to 2,000 words a day. Until then, her experience of writing had been limited to a degree in English and art history at Trinity college, Dublin. She approached her studies with much the same attitude as the novel: \"I thought, 'I've read loads of books, I'll be able to do this.' I was the worst student ever. I didn't want to analyse things.\" </p> <p>Instead of bothering herself with academic work, McLynn spent her time organising student productions. \"I was very bossy when I was a student. Everybody thought I would go into arts administration, but I didn't know anything about organising money.\" After graduation, she got a job at a fringe theatre in Dublin, a ramshackle introduction to acting which seduced her nonetheless. \"At lunchtime, they'd do Yeats for the tourists. Happily, I never had to be in a Yeats production, because I'd rather poke out my eyes with a pointy stick.\" </p> <p>Voiceover work kept her solvent and let her indulge in her first love: theatre. From the start of her career, however, McLynn's fidgety manner and snubby features rec ommended her for character parts. She is relaxed about it now, but in the early days it was a source of sensitivity. \"I never got the romantic leads,\" she says, wringing her hands. \"I was a bit touchy about it in the beginning. I'd always get the daft-old-lady part. Even now, people say to me, 'Are you not done with cranky old bats?' And I'll say, 'No, they're great.'\" </p> <p>Father Ted was the great transformer. For weeks, producers resisted casting her because they thought she was too young for the part, but eventually she joined the team. McLynn is proud of the work they did together, but prouder of the fact that when Alan Parker auditioned her for Angela's Ashes, he had never seen it. \"I read for a small part, a day's work. I didn't realise when I went to see Alan Parker that the part of Aunt Aggie was up for grabs. He doesn't really speak to you, which is a good thing.\" </p> <p>Good, because her inclination to embark on runaway anecdotes when nervous is something she suspects has cost her serious roles. \"I have often gone in for a straight reading and there'll be a silence afterwards, which I'll feel obliged to fill and will talk myself out of the part. By the time you are leav ing you want to say, 'I know, there's no need to call.'\" </p> <p>In spite of the grim subject-matter - Frank McCourt's recollections of his poverty-stricken upbringing in Limerick - McLynn found the five weeks on set with Emily Watson, Robert Carlyle et al an uplifting time. The story reminded her of her own parents' lives. Both grew up in Sligo, north-west Ireland, where her father still sells car parts and her mother is a bookkeeper. </p> <p>\"The film is beautiful. There's a moment where me and Emily are washing little Frank and it's like a Caravaggio. Even though my parents hadn't experienced that level of poverty, they knew people that had. It's the story of a generation.\" </p> <p>Storytelling, says McLynn, is now a main focus of her career. She is knuckling down at her Dublin and Kilkenny homes, which she shares with producer husband Richard Cook, to concentrate on the sequel to Something for the Weekend. The narrative is detailed to the point of stage directions, and film rights cannot be a far-off possibility. </p> <p>McLynn is uncharacteristically intimidated about converting the book into a screenplay, however. \"I would never presume to be a screenwriter. You have to be born with a certain genius for that.\" Her genius is perhaps rarer: for following through idle plans to a very satisfactory conclusion. </p> <p>\u0095 Something for the Weekend, by Pauline McLynn, is published by Headline, priced \u00a39.99, tomorrow.</p>",

To a certain extent, the risks of shopping online have been exaggerated. However, you do need to take precautions. Don't buy at an online store that doesn't offer you 'secure' shopping.

Alternatively, the web address in the location bar at the top of the browser will start with 'https' and not 'http' as usual. </p> <p>Secure shopping is important - and you should never send credit card details via unencrypted email. But it's perfectly possible for a determined fraudster to set up a secure shopping site and then fail to deliver the goods. So the other thing you should do before you spend money is check out the site. Look for a real-world address and telephone number. Don't shop at sites that only give email contact addresses. If something looks dubious, give the site a call. See what they have to say about security. Many reputable online retailers now offer to cover costs if credit card fraud results from purchases made at their sites.

Sometimes sites with the cheapest prices try to claw back something via delivery charges. </p> <p>As for delivery times, although new net retailers pride themselves on speedy delivery, many of the old-style mail order firms now online take rather longer (a couple of weeks is not unheard of). Obviously you want your Valentine's cards and gifts to arrive on the day (or just before). So check things out before you place an order. </p> <p>Many sites seem to be guaranteeing a February 14 delivery if you order early enough. Some list deadlines, beyond which goods will not arrive. If you're unsure, double check with the site itself. Remember (especially if you're buying books or CDs) to check product availability (where possible) and take that into account. For example, on many sites, it will say whether a particular item is available to be dispatched in 24 hours or a few days.

It's easy to do on the net - other shops are, as the ecommerce gurus say, just a click away. If one store doesn't have what you want or seems rather pricey or can't deliver in time, another place may be able to help you out. There are sites that will research the best prices on books, CDs and videos for you. You just enter the name of the thing you want to buy and they come back with a list of prices and links. However, at the moment, they don't cover chocolates and flowers. So if you want to save money as you pledge your undying love, you'll have to click around yourself. </p> <p>Plan ahead. As many people discovered at Christmas, it's definitely a good idea to start shopping early online. Goods go out of stock and, as business peaks, sites need more time to get things to you. With Valentine's Day, it's hard to say how busy online retailers will be. But it's still worth starting early, especially if you're looking for something out of the ordinary at one of the auction sites. </p> <p>Many sites are offering special gift services, in which they will wrap a present for you, enclose a card with a personal message and send it all on to the one you love - anonymously, if you wish, which is convenient.</p> <p>Ask the site If there's anything you don't understand as you're browsing a site. If you can't figure out how to get what you want, if you need a little advice, email the site in question. Many net shops are trying to establish a reputation for good customer service, to show that they can compete with real-world shops. </p> <p> Take your time. OK, the telephone bill is running. But an extra five or ten minutes isn't going to hurt. Online shopping is a new thing. It's easy to make mistakes - over delivery times and availability especially. It's much better to be sure you've got everything right, especially where Valentine's messages are concerned. So take it slowly as you go through filling out the forms. Make sure the message and wrapping paper are the kind of things you want. </p> <p>Check before you shop from work If you're net shopping at the office, make sure it's OK with the boss. People have been sacked for spending too much time bargain hunting online. Ten minutes spent quickly ordering some flowers probably isn't going to be a problem. And it's much better than leaving the office for an hour to do it in the real world. But check anyway. </p> <p>Use your real-world shopping skills. This is an all-purpose tip, good for any time of the year really. Whatever people say, the net isn't that different from the real world. The shopping smarts you've built up from years of pounding the high street still work online. If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is.</p>",

Many sites are offering special gift services, in which they will wrap a present for you, enclose a card with a personal message and send it all on to the one you love - anonymously, if you wish, which is convenient. Ask the site If there's anything you don't understand as you're browsing a site. If you can't figure out how to get what you want, if you need a little advice, email the site in question. Many net shops are trying to establish a reputation for good customer service, to show that they can compete with real-world shops. Take your time. OK, the telephone bill is running. But an extra five or ten minutes isn't going to hurt. Online shopping is a new thing. It's easy to make mistakes - over delivery times and availability especially. It's much better to be sure you've got everything right, especially where Valentine's messages are concerned. So take it slowly as you go through filling out the forms. Make sure the message and wrapping paper are the kind of things you want. Check before you shop from work If you're net shopping at the office, make sure it's OK with the boss. People have been sacked for spending too much time bargain hunting online. Ten minutes spent quickly ordering some flowers probably isn't going to be a problem. And it's much better than leaving the office for an hour to do it in the real world. But check anyway. Use your real-world shopping skills. This is an all-purpose tip, good for any time of the year really. Whatever people say, the net isn't that different from the real world. The shopping smarts you've built up from years of pounding the high street still work online. If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is.",

That was good for Gore because a few months ago he looked in trouble in New Hampshire and was tipped to lose. John McCain, an Arizona senator and war hero, heavily beat George W. Bush, son of the former US president. That result throws the race open although Bush is still the favourite. <p><b>Why is New Hampshire so important? </b><br> It has long been regarded as a crucial marker in the presidential campaign. The tiny state is determined to hold on to its place in the election calendar - when other states move their primaries forward, New Hampshire just moves its contest even further forward. Any candidate with a realistic chance of winning their party's nomination has to do well in New Hampshire. That doesn't mean they have to come first: Bill Clinton came second in 1992, but it was better than expected after a sex scandal and he coined himself the \"Comeback Kid\". The election gives candidates \"bounce\" to go on to fight contests in other states. Some outsider candidates like the Republicans Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer may find it hard to raise money and could drop out. Steve Forbes is very unlikely to become the Republican candidate but is a multi-millionaire so will probably battle on to the bitter end.</p> <p><b>Is it a good thing that New Hampshire is so important? </b><br> Some people complain that the New Hampshire - small, rural, conservative, overwhelmingly white - is not a proper reflection of America and has too much power. Others say it is good for candidates to have to meet small groups of voters and listen to their concerns - what Americans call \"retail politics\", rather than fighting the kind of remote, mass-market , big-money election campaign they will end up with later.</p> <p><b>Do all the states have a primary or a caucus? </b><br> Yes. Delegates from the states will go to their party's conventions in the summer and cast their votes on behalf of their chosen candidate, and the winner takes the party's nomination. The states get a certain number of delegates in proportion to their population. Before the primary system was set up, these conventions used to be much more nerve-wracking. In recent years the result has been a foregone conclusion by the time the conventions come around and the parties try and use the conventions as a stage-managed rally to launch their election campaign.</p> <p><b>Who can vote in a primary? </b><br> US parties don't have members as such, but registered supporters. They don't have to pay subscription but are marked as supporters on the electoral roll. In most primaries, only Republicans can vote in the Republican primary and only Democrats in the Democrat primary. In New Hampshire, confusingly, independent voters - that is, voters not registered for either party - can choose to vote in one of the primaries. They can't vote in both.</p> <p><b>So what happened in Iowa last week? </b><br> That was a caucus, where supporters had to attend a meeting to cast their votes. That was important too, but not quite as important. Bush and Gore won well. McCain didn't bother campaigning there, preferring instead to pick and choose the states he fights in. Partly this is tactical, partly because he is short of money compared to Bush. </p> <p><b>What happens next? </b><br> Bush is contesting the Delaware primary next week, but not McCain. They next square up in South Carolina on February 19. Bush is ahead there but a good showing by McCain again could be very damaging to him. Democrats go on to \"Super Tuesday\" - what Bill Bradley calls \"the first national primary\" - primaries and caucus in 14 states including heavily-populated California, New York and Ohio. Bradley is doing well in New York. </p> <p><b>When does it all wind up? </b><br> The final primaries are on June 6 in Alabama, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota.

      "body": "<p>British American Tobacco's Southampton complex is one of the most modern tobacco plants in the world and will soon be capable of churning out 96bn cigarettes a year.</p> <p>Virtually all the tobacco is exported, with 20 huge containers loaded most days on to ships bound for the Middle East, the Far East and Asia.</p> <p>Many go to Singapore, a key hub in Asian distribution routes, and to Hong Kong and Dubai.</p> <p>In their search to maintain and enlarge cigarette markets, BAT exploited a sophisticated network of smuggling routes operated by others in Asia and the Near East, company documents reveal.</p> <p>Unlike in Latin America, where company executives commonly used the euphemism \"DNP\", meaning duty not paid to denote smuggled goods, BAT documents discussing Asian operations mainly used a different term, \"GT\" or general trade. Company documents repeatedly contrast legal export sales with GT, and break down the total trade into particular countries into the categories of legal or \"GT\". One plan for Singapore refers to how \"the legal market fell but the shortfall was taken up by GT product\". Another plan, for Taiwan, showed \"the split between Legal and GT.\"</p> <p><b> Legal routes</b><br></p> <p>Other pointers to the meaning of GT in company documents include references to difficulties with customs or closed borders, indicating that the reason why GT trade was illegal was because it involved smuggling. In relation to moving cigarettes into Myanmar (formerly Burma) from Thailand, a fax of November 30, 1992 from BAT's Singapore subsidiary warns: \"Duty-paid sales to Myanmar had been strong but the political situation had closed all legal routes in from Thailand, leaving only GT trade...\"</p> <p>The report added: \"This closure coincided with the monsoon season and the consequent redeployment of security forces from rebel engagements to internal security activities. The GT route thereby became more difficult.\"</p> <p>A large part of BAT's GT sales in Asia were handled by one Singapore distributor Singapura United Trading Limited (Sutl). According to company papers, Sutl handled both legal and GT products in the region. Its normal market channels were broken down into domestic sales, duty paid exports, which were legal, duty free sales in airports and to ships and GT. A document of December 10, 1991 identified risks to the company's GT business \"Sutl appreciate that dependency on GT leaves them very vulnerable to market liberalisation (Thailand) and market closure (Vietnam), therefore they are seeking to move that core business to long-term legal ventures involving ownership interest.\"</p> <p>Other company documents from Latin America and Asia used GT interchangeably with DNP and \"transit\", internal euphemisms which also appeared on BAT papers in place of direct references to smuggling. This and other similar evidence from the BAT papers leads to the conclusion that, within British American Tobacco, references to GT in the papers of directors and managers were references to smuggled cigarettes.</p> <p><b> Network of agents</b><br></p> <p>The documents from their Guildford depository do not suggest that BAT employees themselves ever transported contraband across borders. But they took advantage of smuggling markets around the world, using a network of agents who on an annual basis transferred billions of cigarettes into the hands of smugglers.</p> <p>But so large was the role of GT that, according to the most recent information available, a plan covering the period from 1993 to 1997, more than one fifth of the output of BAT's UK factories were made for this market. From their factory at Southampton billions of cigarettes are made annually by BAT (UK and Export) Ltd (Batuke).</p> <p>The information appears in the Batuke company plan for 1993 to 1997. This was one of thousands of documents examined by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, part of the Centre for Public Integrity (CPI) based in Washington DC in the course of their BAT investigation.</p> <p>The copy of this document obtained by CPI and seen by the Guardian is identified as being the copy provided to the then chairman of the BAT Company Ltd, Barry Bramley.</p> <p>Batuke was then the main UK tobacco manufacturing subsidiary of BAT Industries plc. It is marked \"Secret\".</p> <p>According to the plan, Batuke operates in 125 different markets, shipping tobacco products to these markets through 360 agents. The markets are broken down into \"domestic\", \"duty free\" and \"general trade (GT)\".</p> <p>During the period covered by the disclosed documents, extending to 1995, BAT anticipated that over one fifth of its UK and export production would be \"GT\". Under the heading \"General Trade\", it states that \"two key General Trade markets \"will account for 4.7bn units or 22% of Batuke's total shipments\".</p> <p>The two key centres identified in the report are Sutl and \"Unit 1\". Sutl covered countries from Afghanistan to the Philippines, while Unit 1 was involved with Africa. Other centres which can be identified as playing a major role in BAT's GT trade are Dubai, and Hong Kong.</p> <p>The company plan suggests that BAT then proposed to invest in expanding its utilisation of GT methods to reach its end markets. The company \"strategy [focuses] on maximising the GT market opportunities to provide funds to build a stable volume/profit base for the long term ... via investment in duty free and domestic markets\". It added that \"\u00a33.8[m] will be invested to grow our business in the GT markets\".</p> <p>BAT has refused to comment on the meaning of terms like GT, or to discuss the implications of any particular document. The company's public affairs director, Michael Prideaux, said in response to earlier allegations that \"if people wish to draw the inference that we are turning a blind eye to smuggling, they are free to do so. Deterring smuggling is a matter for the governments concerned. The only sure way is to cut tobacco taxes\".</p> <p>But the hundreds of documents in BAT's files on marketing activities in Asia and around the world leave little doubt that some of BAT's top directors and executives were far from blind to smuggling activities. They received reports about new opportunities in GT trade, as well as regular assessments of sales levels that went through legal and GT channels.</p> <p>Important markets in the region for GT cigarettes, according to a report prepare by Fred Coombe, Batuke area manager for Far East, were Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, North Korea, Afghanistan, and Taiwan. The largest potential market was mainland China. Evidence from Hong Kong suggests that BAT cigarettes worth more than \u00a3490m were smuggled into China during the 1990s.</p> <p><b> Floating corpse</b><br></p> <p>In the late 1980s, competition between Hong Kong based rival traders smuggling BAT cigarettes into China became so intense that bribes were paid to the BAT local director whose job was to deal with them.</p> <p>After one jilted trader exposed the system to Hong Kong's anti-corruption commission, former BAT (HK) export director Jerry Lui was extradited from the United States. BAT itself was not charged with any offence.</p> <p>The case against Lui nearly foundered after the chief witness against him, trader Tommy Chui, was murdered. In 1995 his body was found floating in Singapore harbour. His corpse had been placed in a rubbish bag, with tape over his mouth.</p> <p>The warning to other witnesses could hardly have been clearer. Another potential witness committed suicide. Nevertheless, in June 1998, Lui was convicted and sentenced to three years and 8 months imprisonment. He later launched an ultimately unsuccessful appeal and awaits the outcome of a continuing appeal application.</p> <p>BAT company documents disclosed during Lui's trial led judge Mr Justice Wally Yeung Chun-kuen to comment: \"The evidence suggests that management of BAT (HK) was aware duty-not-paid cigarettes ... would ultimately be smuggled in China and other countries. There could be no other explanation for this enormous quantity of duty-not-paid cigarettes worth billions and billions of [Hong Kong] dollars.</p> <p>\"To some extent such irresponsible behaviour amounted to assisting criminals in trans-national crime\".</p> <p>The company claimed at the time that the smuggling was the work of \"rogue employees\", and replied \"British American Tobacco does not smuggle. It does not condone smuggling and its business is entirely lawful\".</p> <p>But the documents now disclosed show that in many Asian countries BAT not merely tolerated GT trade channels, but exploited traditional smuggling routes when they would maximise sales. The documents also trace the rise and fall of Mr Lui within BAT ranks.</p>",

In their search to maintain and enlarge cigarette markets, BAT exploited a sophisticated network of smuggling routes operated by others in Asia and the Near East, company documents reveal. Unlike in Latin America, where company executives commonly used the euphemism \"DNP\", meaning duty not paid to denote smuggled goods, BAT documents discussing Asian operations mainly used a different term, \"GT\" or general trade. Company documents repeatedly contrast legal export sales with GT, and break down the total trade into particular countries into the categories of legal or \"GT\". One plan for Singapore refers to how \"the legal market fell but the shortfall was taken up by GT product\". Another plan, for Taiwan, showed \"the split between Legal and GT.\" Legal routes Other pointers to the meaning of GT in company documents include references to difficulties with customs or closed borders, indicating that the reason why GT trade was illegal was because it involved smuggling. In relation to moving cigarettes into Myanmar (formerly Burma) from Thailand, a fax of November 30, 1992 from BAT's Singapore subsidiary warns: \"Duty-paid sales to Myanmar had been strong but the political situation had closed all legal routes in from Thailand, leaving only GT trade...\" The report added: \"This closure coincided with the monsoon season and the consequent redeployment of security forces from rebel engagements to internal security activities. The GT route thereby became more difficult.\" A large part of BAT's GT sales in Asia were handled by one Singapore distributor Singapura United Trading Limited (Sutl). According to company papers, Sutl handled both legal and GT products in the region. Its normal market channels were broken down into domestic sales, duty paid exports, which were legal, duty free sales in airports and to ships and GT. A document of December 10, 1991 identified risks to the company's GT business \"Sutl appreciate that dependency on GT leaves them very vulnerable to market liberalisation (Thailand) and market closure (Vietnam), therefore they are seeking to move that core business to long-term legal ventures involving ownership interest.\" Other company documents from Latin America and Asia used GT interchangeably with DNP and \"transit\", internal euphemisms which also appeared on BAT papers in place of direct references to smuggling. This and other similar evidence from the BAT papers leads to the conclusion that, within British American Tobacco, references to GT in the papers of directors and managers were references to smuggled cigarettes. Network of agents The documents from their Guildford depository do not suggest that BAT employees themselves ever transported contraband across borders. But they took advantage of smuggling markets around the world, using a network of agents who on an annual basis transferred billions of cigarettes into the hands of smugglers. But so large was the role of GT that, according to the most recent information available, a plan covering the period from 1993 to 1997, more than one fifth of the output of BAT's UK factories were made for this market. From their factory at Southampton billions of cigarettes are made annually by BAT (UK and Export) Ltd (Batuke). The information appears in the Batuke company plan for 1993 to 1997. This was one of thousands of documents examined by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, part of the Centre for Public Integrity (CPI) based in Washington DC in the course of their BAT investigation. The copy of this document obtained by CPI and seen by the Guardian is identified as being the copy provided to the then chairman of the BAT Company Ltd, Barry Bramley. Batuke was then the main UK tobacco manufacturing subsidiary of BAT Industries plc. It is marked \"Secret\". According to the plan, Batuke operates in 125 different markets, shipping tobacco products to these markets through 360 agents. The markets are broken down into \"domestic\", \"duty free\" and \"general trade (GT)\". During the period covered by the disclosed documents, extending to 1995, BAT anticipated that over one fifth of its UK and export production would be \"GT\". Under the heading \"General Trade\", it states that \"two key General Trade markets \"will account for 4.7bn units or 22% of Batuke's total shipments\". The two key centres identified in the report are Sutl and \"Unit 1\". Sutl covered countries from Afghanistan to the Philippines, while Unit 1 was involved with Africa. Other centres which can be identified as playing a major role in BAT's GT trade are Dubai, and Hong Kong. The company plan suggests that BAT then proposed to invest in expanding its utilisation of GT methods to reach its end markets. The company \"strategy [focuses] on maximising the GT market opportunities to provide funds to build a stable volume/profit base for the long term ... via investment in duty free and domestic markets\". It added that \"\u00a33.8[m] will be invested to grow our business in the GT markets\". BAT has refused to comment on the meaning of terms like GT, or to discuss the implications of any particular document. The company's public affairs director, Michael Prideaux, said in response to earlier allegations that \"if people wish to draw the inference that we are turning a blind eye to smuggling, they are free to do so. Deterring smuggling is a matter for the governments concerned. The only sure way is to cut tobacco taxes\". But the hundreds of documents in BAT's files on marketing activities in Asia and around the world leave little doubt that some of BAT's top directors and executives were far from blind to smuggling activities. They received reports about new opportunities in GT trade, as well as regular assessments of sales levels that went through legal and GT channels. Important markets in the region for GT cigarettes, according to a report prepare by Fred Coombe, Batuke area manager for Far East, were Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, North Korea, Afghanistan, and Taiwan. The largest potential market was mainland China. Evidence from Hong Kong suggests that BAT cigarettes worth more than \u00a3490m were smuggled into China during the 1990s. Floating corpse In the late 1980s, competition between Hong Kong based rival traders smuggling BAT cigarettes into China became so intense that bribes were paid to the BAT local director whose job was to deal with them. After one jilted trader exposed the system to Hong Kong's anti-corruption commission, former BAT (HK) export director Jerry Lui was extradited from the United States. BAT itself was not charged with any offence. The case against Lui nearly foundered after the chief witness against him, trader Tommy Chui, was murdered. In 1995 his body was found floating in Singapore harbour. His corpse had been placed in a rubbish bag, with tape over his mouth. The warning to other witnesses could hardly have been clearer. Another potential witness committed suicide. Nevertheless, in June 1998, Lui was convicted and sentenced to three years and 8 months imprisonment. He later launched an ultimately unsuccessful appeal and awaits the outcome of a continuing appeal application. BAT company documents disclosed during Lui's trial led judge Mr Justice Wally Yeung Chun-kuen to comment: \"The evidence suggests that management of BAT (HK) was aware duty-not-paid cigarettes ... would ultimately be smuggled in China and other countries. There could be no other explanation for this enormous quantity of duty-not-paid cigarettes worth billions and billions of [Hong Kong] dollars. \"To some extent such irresponsible behaviour amounted to assisting criminals in trans-national crime\". The company claimed at the time that the smuggling was the work of \"rogue employees\", and replied \"British American Tobacco does not smuggle. It does not condone smuggling and its business is entirely lawful\". But the documents now disclosed show that in many Asian countries BAT not merely tolerated GT trade channels, but exploited traditional smuggling routes when they would maximise sales. The documents also trace the rise and fall of Mr Lui within BAT ranks.",

      "bodyText": "Kenneth Clarke was under growing pressure last night to investigate fresh evidence that British American Tobacco exploited cigarette smuggling. The former chancellor and health secretary, now the London-based multinational's deputy chairman, has a legal duty to protect the company's integrity. BAT documents reveal that huge numbers of cigarettes produced in Southampton, one of the most modern tobacco plants in the world, and other factories were made for the Far East, Middle East and Asia - markets which are dominated by black marketeers. Mr Clarke, paid nearly \u00a368,000 for the part-time post, yesterday failed to respond to repeated requests for a comment about the serious allegations. When pressed, Michael Prideaux, BAT's director of corporate and regulatory affairs, said: \"We don't propose to answer any questions.\" Mr Prideaux, a member of the company's management board, said it would reply at an unspecified time in the future. Today's revelations about the exploitation of smuggling in the Far East, Middle East and Asia follow Monday's disclosure in the Guardian of how the company benefited from black marketeering in Latin America. BAT stonewalled as Labour MPs demanded explanations from the world's second largest tobacco company. Kevin Barron, the chairman of the all-party group on smoking and health, said: \"Ken Clarke holds his position within BAT because of his past office as chancellor and health secretary. \"He has a wider public duty to answer what are very serious allegations about smuggling.\" Fraser Kemp, Labour MP for Houghton &amp; Washington East, said: \"The company cannot bury its head in the sand and hope all this will go away. \"Very serious allegations have been made and Kenneth Clarke and his fellow directors have a responsibility to answer them now.\" The all-party Commons health committee is considering whether to recall BAT's non-smoking chairman, Martin Broughton, or ask for fresh evidence as part of its inquiry into the tobacco industry. On Monday night, a senior World Health Organisation official promised a clampdown on powerful tobacco companies with an international treaty planned to curb their activities. BAT sells 900bn cigarettes a year and is challenging US-based Philip Morris for pole position in the global tobacco business.",

      "body": "<p>The government yesterday agreed a 3.3% pay increase for all teachers in England and Wales, but offered to raise this to more than 11% for experienced staff who pass a performance review to move on to a higher salary scale from September. </p> <p>Ministers said 220,000 senior teachers would be eligible to apply for the first round of the experiment in performance pay in schools. At least half are expected to qualify for an additional \u00a32,000, followed by four annual \u00a31,000 increments, taking the classroom maximum to about \u00a330,000. </p> <p>But the teaching unions said most of the 450,000 teachers in England and Wales would not get a performance increase and for them the 3.3% offer was less than the going rate for increases in average earnings, currently 4.6%. </p> <p>Union leaders said the starting salary for honours graduates would slip further behind other professions. The pay for newly qualified teachers will rise by \u00a3513 to \u00a316,050. </p> <p>David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, accepted the recommendations of the School Teachers' Review Body, which gave the green light to his plans for performance-related promotion. </p> <p>The package included no further information about how performance would be assessed, although the process is certain to include measurements of pupils' progress. Details will be published later this month. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett dismissed claims by local education authorities that they would not be able to afford the basic 3.3% rise. It would cost \u00a3420m, but the councils' education spending assessments had already been raised by \u00a31,103m, he said. The government has set aside \u00a31bn over two years to fund performance pay. </p> <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said confidential drafts of the criteria for performance pay showed it \"threatens to turn the whole process into a bullshitter's charter\". </p> <p>Although the 3.3% rise beat inflation, it fell below the average earnings rise \"and so takes teaching down a further notch or two in the salaries league table. Every government is the same. They all want a Rolls-Royce education service powered by a Mini Metro engine.\" </p> <p>Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"This minimal increase offers no hope of overcoming the recruitment crisis and leaves existing teachers underpaid, under-valued and overwhelmed by their ever-increasing workload and the excessive demands of government.\" </p> <p>Headteachers' leaders and the Professional Association of Teachers also said the rise was not enough to solve recruitment difficulties. </p> <p>But Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: \"The new pay threshold will be an opportunity for the great majority of experienced teachers to earn more.\" </p> <p>Graham Lane, education chairman of the Local Government Association, said the government funded local authorities for a teachers' pay award of 2.5%. He called on ministers to make up a shortfall of \u00a3110m. Without that authorities could not afford the settlement unless they pulled out of government initiatives to raise standards in schools. </p> <p>Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, said: \"I wish the unions would recognise that teachers went into teaching to work with children and raise standards. The age-old complaint was that society did not reward that. This settlement does.\"</p>",

At least half are expected to qualify for an additional \u00a32,000, followed by four annual \u00a31,000 increments, taking the classroom maximum to about \u00a330,000. But the teaching unions said most of the 450,000 teachers in England and Wales would not get a performance increase and for them the 3.3% offer was less than the going rate for increases in average earnings, currently 4.6%. Union leaders said the starting salary for honours graduates would slip further behind other professions. The pay for newly qualified teachers will rise by \u00a3513 to \u00a316,050. David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, accepted the recommendations of the School Teachers' Review Body, which gave the green light to his plans for performance-related promotion. The package included no further information about how performance would be assessed, although the process is certain to include measurements of pupils' progress. Details will be published later this month. Mr Blunkett dismissed claims by local education authorities that they would not be able to afford the basic 3.3% rise. It would cost \u00a3420m, but the councils' education spending assessments had already been raised by \u00a31,103m, he said. The government has set aside \u00a31bn over two years to fund performance pay. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said confidential drafts of the criteria for performance pay showed it \"threatens to turn the whole process into a bullshitter's charter\". Although the 3.3% rise beat inflation, it fell below the average earnings rise \"and so takes teaching down a further notch or two in the salaries league table. Every government is the same. They all want a Rolls-Royce education service powered by a Mini Metro engine.\" Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"This minimal increase offers no hope of overcoming the recruitment crisis and leaves existing teachers underpaid, under-valued and overwhelmed by their ever-increasing workload and the excessive demands of government.\" Headteachers' leaders and the Professional Association of Teachers also said the rise was not enough to solve recruitment difficulties. But Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: \"The new pay threshold will be an opportunity for the great majority of experienced teachers to earn more.\" Graham Lane, education chairman of the Local Government Association, said the government funded local authorities for a teachers' pay award of 2.5%. He called on ministers to make up a shortfall of \u00a3110m. Without that authorities could not afford the settlement unless they pulled out of government initiatives to raise standards in schools. Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, said: \"I wish the unions would recognise that teachers went into teaching to work with children and raise standards. The age-old complaint was that society did not reward that. This settlement does.\"",

      "body": "<p>The people of Hyde, it appears, held Dr Harold Shipman in high regard. When he forged Mrs Kathleen Grundy's will, he made her express her gratitude towards him for \"all the care he has given [them]\" - a sentiment that probably reflected their own accurately enough. He was esteemed locally as a wonderful doctor, though it was well known that many of his patients did not survive long. To adapt slightly the old saw about operations before the days of antisepsis, the doctor was a success, but the patients died.</p> <p>It was Shipman's bedside manner that deceived his patients. His very appearance - avuncular, steady, wise, rather older than his years - told in his favour. On seeing his photograph in the newspaper, quite a few people have exclaimed within my hearing that he was just the sort of man to whom they would have liked to confide their secrets.</p> <p>So how do you know that your own doctor is not a Shipman in sheep's clothing? Can you trust your own judgment? How do you know that it is any better than that of the people of Hyde?</p> <p>Every doctor knows of colleagues whose manner inspires the utmost confidence in patients, yet whose clinical skills are distinctly below par. I remember early in my career meeting a young doctor of Adonis-like beauty, with a plausible manner, unctuous and insinuating yet aristocratically superior, who cut a swathe through rich, foreign patients and was paid a fortune by them to administer injections of doubtful utility. His medical knowledge was no better than average, but his clientele longed to see him. He had found a niche and it was difficult to imagine him in any other.</p> <p>At more or less the same time, I knew of a physician in the East End of London who appeared much beloved of his patients, whom we (the junior doctors) all knew nevertheless to be an utterly unscrupulous villain. He never bought food for himself, but accepted gifts from his National Health patients like a potentate receiving tribute from his subjects. You could tell the day when he had an out-patient clinic by the constant trail of people trudging towards the hospital with carrier bags laden with chickens, vegetables and other groceries. For all we knew, he put in advance orders. His manner was rude, bullying and offensive, with inappropriate forays into jocularity and sexual innuendo. He had the smile of a crocodile and if he clapped you on the shoulder (as he did frequently) you were always relieved to discover afterwards that you did not have a knife in your back. It wasn't even as if he was a good doctor: quite the contrary. In serious cases, a friend of mine would call for a taxi (paid for by himself) and put the patient in it with instructions to go to the next hospital - if he wanted to live.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the patients were inclined to swear by this physician and generally wished to see no other. He exerted a strange hold over them, like a medical Svengali. It was as if, having once consulted him, they felt obliged to stick with him come what may - not loyalty exactly, but a kind of Mephistophelean pact.</p> <p>Something similar may have operated back in the 1850s, when the Shipman of that era, William Palmer, the surgeon of Rugeley in Staffordshire, poisoned his best friend, John Parsons Cook, for the sake of money. Cook must by then have been pretty well aware of his friend's true character (he had by then poisoned at least 10 people around him) and he himself survived one or two of Palmer's tentative efforts to poison him. Yet he continued to take food and medicine from Palmer's hand until the very hour of his death.</p> <p>Many of his contemporaries were taken in by the plausible Palmer. \"Most people were at first favourably impressed by this apparently industrious, rising doctor,\" wrote George Fletcher, himself a doctor, who as a boy visited the scene of Palmer's crimes shortly after they were committed. \"When some gross act was shown against him, they thought it was only a chance slip of the religious, well-mannered, soft-spoken young man. But he was cold-blooded and treacherous, with his relentless pursuit of women and money, though he did not appear to have many vices - at any rate, not on the surface, before the eyes of his neighbours. He was an affectionate husband to the wife whom he poisoned, giving her every luxury in his power. He was a kind brother to Walter till his time came to be poisoned.\" As for Palmer's habitual piety (his diary entry written 24 hours before Cook's death reads: \"At Church - Hamilton preached\"), it reminds one of Shipman's expressed wish to donate some of the money from Mrs Grundy's forged legacy to an old people's home and to establish a fund for the support of women who gave birth on the anniversary of her death.</p> <p>Nearer our own day, Dr John Bodkin Adams, a GP who practised before and after the war among the wealthy widows of Eastbourne, was widely believed to have killed for legacies, despite the religious piety that reassured so many of his patients of his inflexible uprightness. It was the widespread local rumours about the numbers of his elderly female patients who died, leaving him something in their wills, from canteens of silver to old Rolls-Royces, that led eventually to his arrest on a charge of murder. Like Shipman, he was supposed to have killed with opiates, though in the event he was acquitted. While some who were involved in the trial believed him to be guilty of several murders, the evidence was equivocal at best (or at worst). Certainly, on the case presented by the Crown, Bodkin Adams could not possibly have been found guilty.</p> <p>A curious thing happened after his acquittal, however: he became an almost universal symbol of medical murder. To this day, if you mention his name, most people will say, as they struggle to recall the precise details: \"Wasn't he the Eastbourne GP who killed all those widows?\" Whether it was because of his owlish appearance and slightly sinister unctuousness, or because of his very name (\"Who would his quietus make with a bare Bodkin Adams?\" as Shakespeare almost wrote), he has always been remembered, or misremembered, as a murderer. Indeed, he was successful in more than one libel suit because newspapers forgot both that he was still alive and that he had been acquitted rather than convicted of murder. It was almost as though everyone wanted him to have been a murderer, to justify their fear and suspicion of doctors.</p> <p>As people who like to believe that we are in charge of our own lives, we chafe and bridle at the notion of authority exercised over us by others, doctors included. That is why we receive with unseemly glee information that doctors have feet of clay, or in the case of Shipman, hands of blood. This confirms our opinion that authority is not to be trusted, that we are right to approach it with a chip on our shoulders. Authority, including that of doctors, detracts from our completeness as fully autonomous human beings: it is an affront to our egos.</p> <p>As a result, we veer constantly between unreasoning faith in the power of doctors - their miracle cures that will set us free at last of ageing, pain and death - and the paranoid belief that every doctor is either a bumbling incompetent or a murderous psychopath. The truth, of course, lies somewhere between these extremes, but we are rarely satisfied by the truth. As Bertrand Russell was so fond of remarking, there is no reason to assume that the truth, when found, will be interesting.</p> <p>You have only to go to last week's newspapers to appreciate the oscillation between unreasonable fear of, and unfounded hope in, doctors. As well as stories of a psychiatrist who had illicit sex with a patient (so much for the so-called medical code of ethics) and a surgeon who cut out the wrong kidney (so much for the profession's technical competence), it was reported that the gene for suicide had been found, holding out the hope that the immemorial curse of self-murder would soon become a thing of the past, and that a method of totally bloodless surgery had been developed.</p> <p>It is as if we believe in technical fixes, but not in those who are deputed to carry them out. Do the Palmers and the Shipmans of this world mean that we are always wrong to trust our doctors? Does the fact that Claudius was a smiling damned villain mean that we should never trust anyone who smiles? Because our judgment is fallible, and there is a very faint chance that we shall be poisoned or otherwise done away with by the doctor we hitherto trusted, does that mean that we should maintain an attitude of implacably hostile suspicion towards our medical advisers? Hardly.</p> <p>Not only are very few doctor's surgeries Bluebeard's Castles (before Shipman I should have been inclined to write that none was), but trust in the doctor is one of the most powerful remedies known, a fact appreciated from Hippocrates onwards. \"Some patients,\" he wrote, \"though aware that their condition is perilous, recover their health simply because of their satisfaction with the goodness of their doctor.\" More than two millennia later, WR Houston published a lecture entitled The Doctor Himself as a Therapeutic Agent. Plus \u00e7a change.</p> <p>Patients want their doctors to be omniscient and omnipotent authorities. When patients complain to me about the treatment they have received before at the hands of another doctor, one of their most frequent complaints is that he looked something up in a book before their very eyes. In their opinion, this demonstrates his ignorance, incompetence and general untrustworthiness. A doctor should know everything without having to look it up: and, it seems, patients would rather be poisoned by a doctor who assumed the false mantle of omniscience than be treated correctly by a cautious doctor who knew that he did not know everything, and was not ashamed to acknowledge the fact before his patients.</p> <p>If we trust our doctor, we trust his treatment; and if we trust his treatment, it is more likely to cure us. The placebo effect, while not a panacea for all the ills to which flesh (and the spirit) is heir, is none the less very strong. So great, indeed, is the placebo effect that it works even when we are fully aware that what we are taking is nothing but a placebo. Even when a patient knows that the medicine he takes is entirely useless, he would rather take it than take nothing at all. And he is right to do so. Irrational confidence is sometimes rational.</p>",

To this day, if you mention his name, most people will say, as they struggle to recall the precise details: \"Wasn't he the Eastbourne GP who killed all those widows?\" Whether it was because of his owlish appearance and slightly sinister unctuousness, or because of his very name (\"Who would his quietus make with a bare Bodkin Adams?\" as Shakespeare almost wrote), he has always been remembered, or misremembered, as a murderer. Indeed, he was successful in more than one libel suit because newspapers forgot both that he was still alive and that he had been acquitted rather than convicted of murder. It was almost as though everyone wanted him to have been a murderer, to justify their fear and suspicion of doctors. As people who like to believe that we are in charge of our own lives, we chafe and bridle at the notion of authority exercised over us by others, doctors included. That is why we receive with unseemly glee information that doctors have feet of clay, or in the case of Shipman, hands of blood. This confirms our opinion that authority is not to be trusted, that we are right to approach it with a chip on our shoulders. Authority, including that of doctors, detracts from our completeness as fully autonomous human beings: it is an affront to our egos. As a result, we veer constantly between unreasoning faith in the power of doctors - their miracle cures that will set us free at last of ageing, pain and death - and the paranoid belief that every doctor is either a bumbling incompetent or a murderous psychopath. The truth, of course, lies somewhere between these extremes, but we are rarely satisfied by the truth. As Bertrand Russell was so fond of remarking, there is no reason to assume that the truth, when found, will be interesting. You have only to go to last week's newspapers to appreciate the oscillation between unreasonable fear of, and unfounded hope in, doctors. As well as stories of a psychiatrist who had illicit sex with a patient (so much for the so-called medical code of ethics) and a surgeon who cut out the wrong kidney (so much for the profession's technical competence), it was reported that the gene for suicide had been found, holding out the hope that the immemorial curse of self-murder would soon become a thing of the past, and that a method of totally bloodless surgery had been developed. It is as if we believe in technical fixes, but not in those who are deputed to carry them out. Do the Palmers and the Shipmans of this world mean that we are always wrong to trust our doctors? Does the fact that Claudius was a smiling damned villain mean that we should never trust anyone who smiles? Because our judgment is fallible, and there is a very faint chance that we shall be poisoned or otherwise done away with by the doctor we hitherto trusted, does that mean that we should maintain an attitude of implacably hostile suspicion towards our medical advisers? Hardly. Not only are very few doctor's surgeries Bluebeard's Castles (before Shipman I should have been inclined to write that none was), but trust in the doctor is one of the most powerful remedies known, a fact appreciated from Hippocrates onwards. \"Some patients,\" he wrote, \"though aware that their condition is perilous, recover their health simply because of their satisfaction with the goodness of their doctor.\" More than two millennia later, WR Houston published a lecture entitled The Doctor Himself as a Therapeutic Agent. Plus \u00e7a change. Patients want their doctors to be omniscient and omnipotent authorities. When patients complain to me about the treatment they have received before at the hands of another doctor, one of their most frequent complaints is that he looked something up in a book before their very eyes. In their opinion, this demonstrates his ignorance, incompetence and general untrustworthiness. A doctor should know everything without having to look it up: and, it seems, patients would rather be poisoned by a doctor who assumed the false mantle of omniscience than be treated correctly by a cautious doctor who knew that he did not know everything, and was not ashamed to acknowledge the fact before his patients. If we trust our doctor, we trust his treatment; and if we trust his treatment, it is more likely to cure us. The placebo effect, while not a panacea for all the ills to which flesh (and the spirit) is heir, is none the less very strong. So great, indeed, is the placebo effect that it works even when we are fully aware that what we are taking is nothing but a placebo. Even when a patient knows that the medicine he takes is entirely useless, he would rather take it than take nothing at all. And he is right to do so. Irrational confidence is sometimes rational.",

      "bodyText": "Primrose Shipman, the matronly and loyal wife, posed for photographs in a show of family unity yesterday. In a press call outside her home in Mottram, near Hyde, she emerged with her son, David, 20, but refused to answer questions. \"It is no comment\" is all she would say. Life appeared to go on as normal in the Shipman home. David put out the rubbish and told reporters: \"There's no comment now, there will be no comment in the future, there will be no comment at any time.\" The decision by the health secretary, Alan Milburn, to strip Shipman of his NHS pension casts uncertainty over Mrs Shipman's future. Although Shipman continued to receive his salary of about \u00a350,000 during the trial, that will now end. Mrs Shipman may be forced to sell their house, thought to be worth \u00a390,000, and may have to rely on her children for financial help. During the trial, she told one member of the public that she would be forced to get a job if her husband was sent to prison. In the 33 years of their marriage - Primrose was 17 and five months pregnant at the wedding - she is known to have worked as a childminder and helped out in Shipman's surgery. The youngest of their four children, Samuel, 17, lives at home. The eldest, Sarah, 32, was apparently estranged from the family for several years, but attended the trial periodically. Christopher, 28, works in the south of England. During the trial Mrs Shipman handed out chocolates and joked with court officials. Her husband sent her a poem from his prison cell as he waited to go on trial. Despair featured prominently in it.",

Kilfoyle was the New Labour moderniser who took on Militant which had vowed that it would be the last outpost of working-class industrial radicalism in Britain even if the city went to the wall. Militant lost and Liverpool went under. Now it has the highest unemployment rate in the country and a Liberal Democrat city council. Liverpool feels itself utterly estranged from New Labour which it perceives as a party of the middle class. Which is an odd state of affairs because in my experience the middle classes are the group least likely to have much need for political representation.</p> <p>My MP is not Peter Kilfoyle but Barbara Roche, a junior minister at the home office which is currently proposing that we demand a \u00a35,000 bond from visitors from the Indian sub-continent to ensure that they won't illegally extend their stay in Britain. Every once in a while we bump into each other at the local Thai cafe where she has lunch on surgery days. We argue about the asylum bill, which she is overseeing, and before that, when she was at the DTI, we used to discuss the New Deal. Barbara is an old family friend and if ever I were in trouble, she's the first person I'd ring. But I can't imagine what trouble I could get into, unless I was kidnapped abroad by terrorists. Government lies very lightly on my shoulders.</p> <p>I pay \u00a3936 a year in council tax and as far as I know, the only service I receive for it is refuse collection. The local library has a few, very old books and is threatened with closure, so I pay \u00a3125 a year for membership of the London Library. The swimming pool is always being commandeered for school visits so I have joined an extremely expensive gym. I subsidise, gladly, the education of my friends' children in the local primary and secondary schools, but more often than not, they send their kids to independent schools. I use buses and tubes during the day but taxis in the evenings because I'm not happy with the local street lighting and fear a repetition of a violent assault outside my house late at night.</p> <p>In December I rang my GP to ask for an appointment and was told I would have to wait 12 days (the surgery was full of flu victims). When I eventually saw a doctor she told me that I should have been seen immediately. She referred me to a consultant but advised me to pay to go private if I could afford it. I now have the number of a private doctor for emergencies and am waiting for the BUPA forms.

      "bodyText": "Peter Kilfoyle has left his post as a junior defence minister to spend more time with his constituents in Liverpool. Kilfoyle was the New Labour moderniser who took on Militant which had vowed that it would be the last outpost of working-class industrial radicalism in Britain even if the city went to the wall. Militant lost and Liverpool went under. Now it has the highest unemployment rate in the country and a Liberal Democrat city council. Liverpool feels itself utterly estranged from New Labour which it perceives as a party of the middle class. Which is an odd state of affairs because in my experience the middle classes are the group least likely to have much need for political representation. My MP is not Peter Kilfoyle but Barbara Roche, a junior minister at the home office which is currently proposing that we demand a \u00a35,000 bond from visitors from the Indian sub-continent to ensure that they won't illegally extend their stay in Britain. Every once in a while we bump into each other at the local Thai cafe where she has lunch on surgery days. We argue about the asylum bill, which she is overseeing, and before that, when she was at the DTI, we used to discuss the New Deal. Barbara is an old family friend and if ever I were in trouble, she's the first person I'd ring. But I can't imagine what trouble I could get into, unless I was kidnapped abroad by terrorists. Government lies very lightly on my shoulders. I pay \u00a3936 a year in council tax and as far as I know, the only service I receive for it is refuse collection. The local library has a few, very old books and is threatened with closure, so I pay \u00a3125 a year for membership of the London Library. The swimming pool is always being commandeered for school visits so I have joined an extremely expensive gym. I subsidise, gladly, the education of my friends' children in the local primary and secondary schools, but more often than not, they send their kids to independent schools. I use buses and tubes during the day but taxis in the evenings because I'm not happy with the local street lighting and fear a repetition of a violent assault outside my house late at night. In December I rang my GP to ask for an appointment and was told I would have to wait 12 days (the surgery was full of flu victims). When I eventually saw a doctor she told me that I should have been seen immediately. She referred me to a consultant but advised me to pay to go private if I could afford it. I now have the number of a private doctor for emergencies and am waiting for the BUPA forms. The time my family had real need of the state was when my mother went into a care home; but that isn't covered by the NHS. My lack of reliance on the benefits of government does not mean that I am apolitical, far from it. While Liverpool had a less than 20% turnout in the local elections, I have never missed voting. At 9pm on the day of the European elections, I decided that I couldn't live with myself if I didn't vote, that passionately supporting democracy involved getting off your arse and casting a ballot, because if you don't you're in no position to complain afterwards.

Dr Moira Baird Liverpool \u0095 It would be wrong to dismiss the Shipman case \"complacently as a one-off event\". It would be equally irresponsible to spread fear and mistrust among the public, and a feeling that every GP is a potential killer. Shipman is a murderer; he is not representative of the thousands of family doctors who work competently, compassionately and tirelessly for the benefit of their pa tients. However, it is clear that things need to change: closer scrutiny of the profession is inevitable. This should be embraced by doctors as a way of demonstrating to the public their commitment to delivering high standards, rooting out incompetence, and ultimately making sure that patients are protected. Dr Narinder Sharma Ilford, Essex \u0095 Following the conviction in Preston crown court, the medical ethics alliance is sure that the best protection for patients is the care of doctors who have publicly taken an oath never to harm or kill their patients and who have based their professional lives upon it. Such an oath, however, has long been abandoned by most medical schools. It is clear that safeguards established by law have failed in this case and the alliance would welcome a full inquiry to discover why. Dr AP Cole Medical Ethics Alliance ktorun@medethics-alliance.org \u0095 What fee, if any, is paid to the second doctor signing a cremation certificate (Leader, February 1), and how many hours' work might it be thought to represent? Hugh Davidson Edinburgh hdavidson@freeuk.com \u0095 According to the police, Dr Shipman probably murdered some 130 of his patients, a figure greater than the number murdered with legally owned firearms since the 1968 firearms act. Are we to see a banning of doctors for \"public safety\" reasons and the NHS spending millions in compensation to the victims? Nicholas Royall London \u0095 Why is everyone being so precious about Dr Shipman? Death is creeping up on us all in wonderfully inventive ways and dying is not such a very remarkable thing to do. It's not as though a Shipman were unmasked every other week. Jon Gray Bath jon@grays.demon.co.uk",

In the New Hampshire mountain hamlets of Dixville Notch (registered electorate 29) and Hart's Location (electorate 27), inhabitants held their time-honoured and internationally reported race to declare the first results of the battle for the White House in the early hours of yesterday morning. Within minutes of the polls opening in the two villages they closed again, with all the votes in, giving Mr McCain 19 votes to Mr Bush's 17. In the Democratic contest, former Senator Bill Bradley led Vice-President Al Gore by 13 votes to five. \"The landslide has started. \"Timber!\" Mr McCain joked in a radio interview before the candidates fanned out across New Hampshire to greet voters. With fine weather, the signs were of a high turnout of around 70%, far higher than is expected in November's presidential election. \"I'm going to win,\" a confident Mr Bush announced, as he made his first appearance of a day that could make or - just possibly - begin to break his presidential ambitions. Coffee in hand, the Texas governor arrived at a Manchester polling station shortly before 6.30am. The Gore camp was equally upbeat about the contest with Mr Bradley. \"We feel we've done just about everything we possibly could,\" Mr Gore's wife, Tipper, said on ABC television. \"We feel like the energy is moving definitely to our campaign.\" \"I hope you will feel if you cast that vote that you're part of something new and fresh that is part of a new beginning,\" Mr Bradley said as he headed to a Concord factory. The final New Hampshire opinion polls showed Mr McCain on course for a remarkable win over Mr Bush in the Republican race, and Mr Gore set to score a second victory over Mr Bradley in the Democratic contest, after defeating him in Iowa last week. Mr McCain entered polling day with a final poll average of 43% against Mr Bush's 35%, millionaire conservative Steve Forbes's 14%, Alan Keyes's 8% and Gary Bauer's 1%. In the Democratic race, Mr Gore had a poll average of 54% against Mr Bradley's 45%. Mr Bradley has five weeks to re-energise his campaign before the next Democratic contests in the March 7 \"Super Tuesday\" primaries, when 16 states hold primaries or caucuses, including California and New York. Mr Bradley's best hope of a significant win is in New York, where he is remembered for his decade as a basketball star with the New York Knicks. But Mr Gore lost no time in taking his victorious message to New York last night and was due to hold a 3am rally there.

The deferral means a simplified child support formula will be applied to new cases in April 2002. Last summer the operative date had been late 2001. Existing cases will not be transferred from the present, deeply unpopular formula until later - some possibly not before 2004 - by which time many fathers will no longer have maintenance liability. The postponement came days after the Commons social security committee voiced concern about spending plans for the computer system. In the first use of a new ministerial power, Mr Darling had notified the committee of his intention to spend money developing the computer system before parliament approved the bill setting out the agency changes. The committee was first told he wished to spend \u00a360m before royal assent was granted, enabling the Affinity consortium - led by a US computer company, EDS - to start development. Subsequently however, this figure was revised to \u00a36m.

The changes come into effect at the start of the next booking period on February 16. A spokesman for the opera house, in Covent Garden, central London, said yesterday that it was conducting a wider review of prices for operas and ballets that would take effect on bookings from September.

Leading members of the classical music world, including composer and conductor Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Sir Simon Rattle, Sir Harrison Birtwistle and Sir Edward Downes, have attacked the proposed cutbacks to the Henry Watson music library which, they say, will devastate \"a jewel in our cultural heritage\". Under the proposals the collection at Manchester's central library is to lose its specialist librarian, while the 600,000 books and scores will be rehoused within a general reading library or transferred onto new media technology. Sir Peter, who grew up in Manchester, said: \"Without the Henry Watson music library and its excellent, well-trained and knowledgeable staff, I simply wouldn't be here today. \"It was essential for me to be free to burrow among the shelves and to be able to seek advice when necessary, both as a schoolboy and as a student.

The report, compiled by paediatricians and funded by the department of health, also said that routines for investigating when a baby died unexpectedly were \"inadequate and in need of revision\". Both natural and unnatural causes of death were not being spotted, said the authors, due to poor investigation and the application of the blanket definition of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), or cot death. The report was undertaken by a monitoring scheme set up by the government some years ago - the Confidential Enquiry Into Stillbirths and Deaths in Infancy, and by the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths. Researchers looked at the deaths of 450 babies aged one week to one year between 1993 and 1996, of which 325 were categorised as cot deaths. In 60% the researchers decided that poor care was involved - usually parents failing to follow advice widely put out for safeguarding infants, such as putting them to sleep on their backs, avoiding duvets or quilts, and maintaining a smoke-free zone at all times. In 6% of cases they found that the baby had been maltreated, but the maltreatment had not been discovered. This included deliberate harm and neglect or extremely poor care. There was no evidence to sustain some of the theories around cot death - airline flights and mattress types were not a risk factor. Breathing monitors showed no value in preventing deaths. The authors were critical of the way baby deaths are investigated. Postmortems were not always thorough, they found. Medical and family histories that might be important were not always available to those who were deciding the cause of death and signing the death certificate. \"As a result it was believed that causes of death, both natural and unnatural, may be unrecognised,\" the report said. Consequently, parents did not receive the proper support and advice and \"uninformed speculation concerning maltreatment may arise\". The authors recommended stronger procedures. All families where an infant death occurred should be visited at home within 48 hours by a paediatrician or another health professional who would liaise with a specially trained police officer to gather information about the baby, family, and circumstances of the death, and to offer support. Postmortems should be done by a paediatric pathologist trained in examining babies, who should have the information from the home visit. All the professionals should meet to pool their information and decide what caused the death and how best to help the family. The study found that there were no ethnic differences between families likely to experience a cot death, but social and economic factors were evident. Many of the families whose babies died inexplicably in the 1990s lived in overcrowded, damp and mouldy housing, their parents were unemployed, and they had a low income. Many cot death babies were found to have had medical problems from birth, and their mothers were found to be more likely to have had a stillbirth or another child die in infancy.

The 19-year-old, who had been at university for two weeks when she found she was pregnant, was told she could not remove her son, who is a year old tomorrow, from the couple he has been with since last April after they were approved as adopters. Mr Justice Sumner ruled in the high court family division that the natural mother had been unreasonable in changing her mind, and that the couple he is with can adopt him despite her objections. Describing his judgment as a \"fearful\" one, the judge said he was satisfied that to return the boy, identified as A, to his natural mother now would pose too great a risk of disturbance and lasting damage to him. The ruling makes clear to mothers giving up children that if they change their minds it could be too late. \"The risks to his health and future development are too great,\" said Mr Justice Sumner. \"It would be traumatic in the short run and likely to be damaging in the long run.

Sir Michael Burton, picked by the government to chair the beefed-up central arbitration committee which can rule on contested union claims for the right to negotiate for members, represented working miners during the 1984-85 coal dispute and News International in its 1986 confrontation with the print unions. The appointment, yet to be formally announced, comes after months of argument between the government, the TUC and the Confederation of British Industry over who should get the crucial post. The TUC had hoped for George Bain, who chaired the low pay commission on the minimum wage, while the cabinet office minister Lord Falconer argued for his friend Sir Stephen Richards, another high court judge and an Oxford contemporary of Tony Blair. But Sir Stephen was resisted by the unions, who regarded him as one of \"Tony's cronies\" without industrial relations experience. Now the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, is understood to have settled on Sir Michael - whose industrial relations experience is unlikely to be to the taste of many trade unionists - with guidance from 10 Downing Street. During the miners' strike, the watershed industrial dispute of the post-war era, Sir Michael was the QC in a pivotal case brought by two strike-breaking Yorkshire miners against the National Union of Mineworkers. The action led to the strike being outlawed and the seizure of NUM funds. The then coal board chairman, Ian MacGregor, called the case \"the key to the solution of the strike\". Sir Michael, 53, also represented Rupert Murdoch's News International against the print unions after the company sacked 5,000 print workers and moved the production of four national newspapers to Wapping, east London. News International still refuses to recognise unions at Wapping and lobbied intensively against the new right to union recognition where more than half a workforce wants it, which is enshrined in last year's employment relations act and comes into force later this year. Sir Michael, who stood as a Labour council candidate in the 1970s and for the breakaway Social Democratic party in the 1981 Greater London council elections, has represented both unions and employers over the years. But some union leaders are alarmed by his appointment to the arbitration committee.

A spokesman for the acting returning officer said it was too late to do anything and anyway people knew to vote for one candidate. Beatles voted best band ever The Beatles have been declared \"best band ever\" in a poll of readers of the NME weekly music paper. At a London awards ceremony last night Blur beat last year's winners, Manic Street Preachers, for best band, a title Blur last won in 1995. Dome to open evenings Evening openings on Fridays and Saturdays will start in April at the Millennium Dome, with the doors staying open until 11pm. Sales of April tickets began yesterday; the month, which includes Easter and school holidays, will be a key one for the dome. Learn to relax on the job Employees are to be taught how to avoid back pain - the largest single cause of sickness absence at work. More than 330 employers applied for government funding, with 19 chosen yesterday to run pilot projects, including staff at St Helens council in Lancashire being taught relaxation, posture and exercise. Bond passport was for real spy A passport used by Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels, for real-life spying is to be auctioned this month. During the war Fleming was sent by British intelligence to Gibraltar to spy on fascist Spain in a mission codenamed Operation Goldeneye; he later chose Goldeneye as the name for his house in Jamaica, and it was also used for a Bond film in 1995. Chat online to a doctor A website was launched last night giving medical advice and online chat from health professionals, including a psychotherapist and an obstetrician. GMTV doctor Hilary Jones is to front the site, part of NetDoctor.co.uk, a European network.

      "bodyText": "Nice guys finish last, they say in the kind of business school in which John Maples was trained. Last night he paid the price for failing to do the shadow cabinet's business against Frank Dobson, George Robertson and Robin Cook. It was not that the Tory MP for Stratford-on-Avon failed to understand the issues or to put in as much work as most of his shadow colleagues, except the Stakhanovite John Redwood. What he lacked was an instinct for the jugular. Worse, he was by temperament a moderate Tory of the old school - Marlborough College in his case - having to work in an increasingly immoderate party. He loyally peddled the Hague line against the euro and EU integration, but his heart never quite seemed in his work. It looked very different when Mr Maples got back to Westminster in May 1997 after losing marginal Lewisham West in 1992. A junior minister under John Major, he missed the years of Tory disaster and looked set to go far. There was a red light over his career in those years in which he hunted for a byelection seat: Maples wrote a candid report on the Tories' weaknesses under Major. Silence was the best policy on the NHS, he suggested. It was promptly leaked. A Cambridge and Harvard business school graduate (a barrister too), he had made a modest pile as a management consultant and married Jane Corbin, a tough and glamorous TV reporter, before becoming an MP in 1987. He hammered Labour weakness over NHS waiting lists, but the bruiser in Frank Dobson saw him off. Kosovo was a near-impossible policy to attack from anything but the far right. Now he has had to make way for Francis Maude to do better. \"Sometimes there just aren't enough seats at the table,\" one colleague said sympathetically last night.",

Russians Observed (1969) brought home the Russian people's humanity - at a time when they could scarcely be encountered because of cold war barriers. He put his knowledge at the disposal of the research body tracking eastern European religious developments, Keston College (now Keston Institute, Oxford), of which he was the first chairman (1969-83) and then honorary president. His chairmanship of the Great Britain-USSR Association (1970-85) was equally distinguished, as was his work with the Church Missionary Society. He always advocated straight and uncompromised talking with Soviet officialdom and politicised church leaders. Lawrence's association with India led to The Journals Of Honoria Lawrence (1980) and Lawrence Of Lucknow (1990), which he claimed to be his favourite among all his writings. He often revisited India and Pakistan. John Lawrence inherited the baronetcy on the death of his brother Henry in 1967. He was twice married; first to Jacynth Ellerton, and after her death to Audrey Woodiwiss, his literary collaborator, whose devotion sustained him in his later days. He had no children. \u0095 John Waldemar Lawrence, diplomat and writer, born May 27 1907; died December 30 1999",

The sharp upward revision of the impact of the uncontrolled chain reaction on September 30 is a fresh blow to public confidence in a nuclear industry that has suffered a series of accidents and cover-ups over the past few years. Japan's science and technology agency revealed that 439 people were exposed to neutron rays during the 20 hours in which the nuclear fission took place at a uranium processing plant in Tokaimura, 80 miles northeast of Tokyo. In its initial report, the agency said only 69 people were affected. The accident occurred when plant workers used buckets to mix nearly eight times the correct amount of condensed uranium. According to the agency's revised figures, the resulting fission exposed 119 residents, plant workers and emergency service staff to more than one millisievert of radiation, which is the annual permissible level. It is the first time that an accident in Japan has affected more than 100 people to such an extent. One worker who battled to halt the chain reaction suffered as much as 38 millisieverts and ambulance crews who arrived without being told they were visiting a nuclear accident site were exposed to high levels of radiation. The agency played down the health implications of its findings, saying that the risks of cancer only increased significantly with a dose of more than 50 millisieverts. It said the revised figures were higher because the later assessment included local residents. \"This makes the number look bigger than the original figures we reported,\" an agency official told reporters. Anti-nuclear groups, however, said the data under played the seriousness of the accident. \"We still don't think this is an accurate figure.

The average incidence of leukaemia is 0.66% in Japan. According to the International Commission of Radiological Protection, the risk increases by 0.05 points for every 10 millisieverts of exposure. The new figures are likely to add to public concern about the safety of the nuclear industry. Since the chain reaction, several local governments have halted or cancelled nuclear energy projects.

      "body": "<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) will go to court next week in an attempt to find out further information about the FBI's investigation into John Lennon for his involvement in the peace movement.</p> <p>A new book examining the FBI's files on the former member of the Beatles charts a bizarre, covert security operation that included logging a parrot's subversive remarks and attempting to get municipal police to arrest Lennon on drugs charges.</p> <p>Since 1981, Jon Wiener, a professor of history at the University of California, Irvine, has been attempting to get access to the FBI's files on Lennon through the Freedom of Information Act. He has published his findings in the book, Gimme Some Truth, the John Lennon FBI Files.</p> <p>\"What is most interesting is the immense triviality of a lot of the information gathered,\" said Prof Wiener yesterday.</p> <p>Lennon was known by the FBI as a major contributor to radical causes on both sides of the Atlantic, where he assisted in paying the fines for those arrested during anti-apartheid demonstrations and funding financially troubled underground newspapers.</p> <p>Another action that irked US authorities was his involvement with an organisation that attempted to register young voters opposed to the Vietnam war, which at the time was at its height.</p> <p>The politically minded Lennon also considered attending the August 1972 Republican convention in Miami, which turned into a massive anti-war demonstration where more than 1,000 people were arrested.</p> <p>At the time, the FBI director, J Edgar Hoover, alerted President Richard Nixon to the fact that Lennon was \"a former member of the Beatles singing group\". As such, there was concern that, as Nixon was running for election against Democrat George McGovern, a candidate more attractive to young voters, Lennon would stage a national concert tour urging young people to register and vote.</p> <p>Lennon apparently contributed $75,000 to the Election Year Strategy Information Centre to this effect.</p> <p>Even so, Lennon's expulsion from the US was seen in some conservative quarters as a last resort. Since the musician was at that time seeking to clarify his immigration status, Republican senator Strom Thurmond wrote to the White House advising that \"if Lennon's visa is terminated, it would be a strategy counter-measure caution must be taken with regard to the possible alienation of the so-called 18-year-old vote if Lennon is expelled from the country\".</p> <p>Prof Wiener likened the FBI's performance at the time to that of the Keystone Cops. At one stage it even released a photo supposedly of Lennon but in fact of another musician who also had long hair, a beard and glasses.</p> <p>One of the documents that the FBI sought to protect from public gaze for national security reasons contained the information that \"the International Society for Krishna Consciousness was backed by George Harrison and John Lennon. It appears that these individuals are members of the Beatles singing group who reside in England.\"</p> <p>One of the key figures in the covert operation was Julie Maynard, an FBI undercover officer who died in 1997, but who had contacted Prof Weiner when she learned about his search for information on the Lennon files.</p> <p>Maynard had infiltrated the \"Yippies\" who were planning a major demonstration at the Republican convention. She discovered that a number of rock bands were approached to play at the demonstration but were unwilling to do so because of a lack of insurance. Lennon sent a $40,000 cheque to cover this.</p> <p>To counter the demonstrations, the Watergate participants and notorious Nixon-affiliated dirty tricksters, Gordon Liddy and E Howard Hunt, had even suggested mugging demonstrators and abducting the leaders, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, and smuggling them to Mexico.</p> <p>The records also disclose that the FBI had suggested that \"Miami should note that Lennon is reportedly a heavy user of narcotics. This information should be emphasised to local law enforcement agencies with regard to the subject being arrested if at all possible.\"</p> <p>One report, written by an FBI informant in 1972 about a meeting of anti-war activists in New York, that illustrates the often absurd nature of the investigation recorded that \"a girl there named Linda\" had a parrot that \"interjects 'Right on!' whenever the conversation gets rousing\".</p> <p>This gem of espionage wisdom was classified as confidential and not released for 25 years.</p> <p>Prof Wiener said that the next stage was a civil hearing next week in Los Angeles, where the ACLU will seek details about other information on Lennon being withheld because it involved a \"foreign power\" (Britain). Currently, the FBI refuses to disclose the name of the foreign government, although it is obvious.</p> <p>\"[Withholding the information] is the same kind of ridiculous action as the actions taken against John Lennon,\" said Prof Wiener. \"It's hard to believe how much effort they put into this.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) will go to court next week in an attempt to find out further information about the FBI's investigation into John Lennon for his involvement in the peace movement. A new book examining the FBI's files on the former member of the Beatles charts a bizarre, covert security operation that included logging a parrot's subversive remarks and attempting to get municipal police to arrest Lennon on drugs charges. Since 1981, Jon Wiener, a professor of history at the University of California, Irvine, has been attempting to get access to the FBI's files on Lennon through the Freedom of Information Act. He has published his findings in the book, Gimme Some Truth, the John Lennon FBI Files. \"What is most interesting is the immense triviality of a lot of the information gathered,\" said Prof Wiener yesterday. Lennon was known by the FBI as a major contributor to radical causes on both sides of the Atlantic, where he assisted in paying the fines for those arrested during anti-apartheid demonstrations and funding financially troubled underground newspapers. Another action that irked US authorities was his involvement with an organisation that attempted to register young voters opposed to the Vietnam war, which at the time was at its height. The politically minded Lennon also considered attending the August 1972 Republican convention in Miami, which turned into a massive anti-war demonstration where more than 1,000 people were arrested. At the time, the FBI director, J Edgar Hoover, alerted President Richard Nixon to the fact that Lennon was \"a former member of the Beatles singing group\". As such, there was concern that, as Nixon was running for election against Democrat George McGovern, a candidate more attractive to young voters, Lennon would stage a national concert tour urging young people to register and vote. Lennon apparently contributed $75,000 to the Election Year Strategy Information Centre to this effect. Even so, Lennon's expulsion from the US was seen in some conservative quarters as a last resort. Since the musician was at that time seeking to clarify his immigration status, Republican senator Strom Thurmond wrote to the White House advising that \"if Lennon's visa is terminated, it would be a strategy counter-measure caution must be taken with regard to the possible alienation of the so-called 18-year-old vote if Lennon is expelled from the country\". Prof Wiener likened the FBI's performance at the time to that of the Keystone Cops. At one stage it even released a photo supposedly of Lennon but in fact of another musician who also had long hair, a beard and glasses. One of the documents that the FBI sought to protect from public gaze for national security reasons contained the information that \"the International Society for Krishna Consciousness was backed by George Harrison and John Lennon. It appears that these individuals are members of the Beatles singing group who reside in England.\" One of the key figures in the covert operation was Julie Maynard, an FBI undercover officer who died in 1997, but who had contacted Prof Weiner when she learned about his search for information on the Lennon files. Maynard had infiltrated the \"Yippies\" who were planning a major demonstration at the Republican convention. She discovered that a number of rock bands were approached to play at the demonstration but were unwilling to do so because of a lack of insurance. Lennon sent a $40,000 cheque to cover this. To counter the demonstrations, the Watergate participants and notorious Nixon-affiliated dirty tricksters, Gordon Liddy and E Howard Hunt, had even suggested mugging demonstrators and abducting the leaders, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, and smuggling them to Mexico. The records also disclose that the FBI had suggested that \"Miami should note that Lennon is reportedly a heavy user of narcotics. This information should be emphasised to local law enforcement agencies with regard to the subject being arrested if at all possible.\" One report, written by an FBI informant in 1972 about a meeting of anti-war activists in New York, that illustrates the often absurd nature of the investigation recorded that \"a girl there named Linda\" had a parrot that \"interjects 'Right on!' whenever the conversation gets rousing\". This gem of espionage wisdom was classified as confidential and not released for 25 years. Prof Wiener said that the next stage was a civil hearing next week in Los Angeles, where the ACLU will seek details about other information on Lennon being withheld because it involved a \"foreign power\" (Britain). Currently, the FBI refuses to disclose the name of the foreign government, although it is obvious. \"[Withholding the information] is the same kind of ridiculous action as the actions taken against John Lennon,\" said Prof Wiener. \"It's hard to believe how much effort they put into this.\"",

Our account yesterday on page 4 of the investigations that led to Shipman's arrest referred to the doctor as administering lethal doses of morphine, while a caption said he gave victims diamorphine hydrochloride, which - being heroin - is different. To clarify: both are correct. The police say he used either or both. Our leader on post-Shipman reforms, page 23, yesterday, harked back to the infamous 1960s case of Bodkin Adams, the last British doctor suspected of killing patients. Except that it was in the 1950s. In yesterday's first edition, page 36, Sport, Tranmere were listed to play Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Later editions corrected this to show Newcastle as Tranmere's adversary. William Crosbie, a grand old man of Scottish art, did not live out 1999 to see his name in our Birthdays list as turning 84 on January 31.

      "body": "<p>Forget the upturned saucer at Greenwich. The truly inspiring millennial space will shortly be revealed 300 miles north of London on a street corner opposite a laundrette and a wholesale fruit merchants. A century ago an energetic middle-aged mother of three, Phoebe Anna Traquair, was completing a remarkable work of art. Barely taller than an altar table, Mrs Traquair spent the best part of eight years decorating the interior of an Edinburgh church in anticipation of the imminent return of Christ. Now, many disappointed decades later, the Heritage Lottery Fund and various other angels are stepping in with over \u00a34m to preserve her extraordinary greetings card - roughly 15,000 square feet of tableaux illustrating the travails of the human soul, episodes from the Old and New Testaments and, on the huge west wall, Christ's majestic return to Earth. Ecstatic layers of beasts, cherubim, saints and the saved hover in throbbing blues and reds about the 66ft high chancel arch. </p> <p>Artist and patron were made for each other. Mrs Traquair, the Dublin-born wife of an Edinburgh museum official, was a gifted disciple of William Morris's Arts and Crafts movement, equally convinced that beauty transformed lives (particularly those of the poor) and that God ran human affairs. </p> <p>The Catholic Apostolic Church was established in the 1820s by mystics certain that the French Revolution presaged Armageddon and that it was their mission to unite the Christian faiths in preparation for the spiritual millennium. The Apostolics built a cathedral in Gordon Square in London, then, in 1872, commissioned the distinguished Edinburgh architect Robert Rowand Anderson to design an appropriately exalted structure for a site half a mile north of Princes Street, in Mansfield Place. </p> <p>Depending on which version you prefer, Mrs Traquair either wandered into a service by chance and begged for a commission, or was formally contracted by the Catholic Apostolics to provide the finishing touches to their prestigious divine reception centre. Either way, Mrs Traquair was an inspired appointment. She worked devotedly at the project between 1893 and 1901, for much of the time perched on a giant wooden scaffold \"just like what the artists have in Paris\", she chortled to her nephew Willie in one of the letters preserved by the Scottish National Library. Ninety-nine years and several cultural shifts on, her output still overwhelms the visitor. Only Stanley Spencer's first world war frescoes at Burghclere can match it in scale and lyrical intensity. </p> <p>The tiny Mrs Traquair was forced reluctantly to employ a male assistant for some of the tricky bits. \"[He has] no more sense of feeling than wood,\" she groaned to Willie in April 1896. \"I felt inclined to push him off the scaffolding a day or two ago for injuring the profile of two angels.\" Mrs Traquair's own figures have the fragile, translucent beauty found in Botticelli and the corridors of superior nursing homes. \"When potential donors walk in, you see their jaws drop,\" says Rosemary Mann, secretary of the Mansfield Traquair Trust, which for the past seven years has been fighting to rescue the murals for posterity. In many ways the trust's achievement has matched Mrs Traquair's. After the Catholic Apostolics vacated the building in 1959, it fell into the hands of the Baptists and then the Edinburgh Brick Company, which wanted to turn it into offices. In a splendid irony the developer's architect, Stewart Brown, swapped horses and began campaigning for the building's preservation. </p> <p>A 16-month programme to convert the church's sizable basement into a headquarters for the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations begins in late spring. The main body of the church will become an exhibition and performance space. Restoration of the murals will begin once the walls have dried out. </p> <p>Mrs Traquair's reputation as a brilliant miniaturist - a book she illuminated recently sold for \u00a333,000 - has hitherto overshadowed the public art to which she attached so much importance. In 1891 she complained bitterly to Willie about the local Sick Children's Hospital's plan to demolish the exquisite consolatory mural she had painted five years earlier for its mortuary. \"They, the horrible Edinburgh little handful of bigots who form the directors of the hospital want to pull it down,\" she wrote. \"I feel as if my pet child was to be murdered.\" </p> <p>The directors did relent, and the plaster panels were painstakingly transported by horse and cart to the new mortuary, where they remain available for inspection today. Or almost available. Modern hospitals must contend with modern sensibilities. Mrs Traquair's sweet souls whizzing in tiny firepods past sinister snakes and soft-skinned angels are now shrouded by white curtains. \"Too many parents found them traumatising,\" a hospital spokesman shrugs. </p> <p>Phoebe Traquair's murals can be seen by prior arrangement with the Mansfield Traquair Trust (0131-557 1856).</p>",

Now, many disappointed decades later, the Heritage Lottery Fund and various other angels are stepping in with over \u00a34m to preserve her extraordinary greetings card - roughly 15,000 square feet of tableaux illustrating the travails of the human soul, episodes from the Old and New Testaments and, on the huge west wall, Christ's majestic return to Earth. Ecstatic layers of beasts, cherubim, saints and the saved hover in throbbing blues and reds about the 66ft high chancel arch. Artist and patron were made for each other. Mrs Traquair, the Dublin-born wife of an Edinburgh museum official, was a gifted disciple of William Morris's Arts and Crafts movement, equally convinced that beauty transformed lives (particularly those of the poor) and that God ran human affairs. The Catholic Apostolic Church was established in the 1820s by mystics certain that the French Revolution presaged Armageddon and that it was their mission to unite the Christian faiths in preparation for the spiritual millennium. The Apostolics built a cathedral in Gordon Square in London, then, in 1872, commissioned the distinguished Edinburgh architect Robert Rowand Anderson to design an appropriately exalted structure for a site half a mile north of Princes Street, in Mansfield Place. Depending on which version you prefer, Mrs Traquair either wandered into a service by chance and begged for a commission, or was formally contracted by the Catholic Apostolics to provide the finishing touches to their prestigious divine reception centre. Either way, Mrs Traquair was an inspired appointment. She worked devotedly at the project between 1893 and 1901, for much of the time perched on a giant wooden scaffold \"just like what the artists have in Paris\", she chortled to her nephew Willie in one of the letters preserved by the Scottish National Library. Ninety-nine years and several cultural shifts on, her output still overwhelms the visitor. Only Stanley Spencer's first world war frescoes at Burghclere can match it in scale and lyrical intensity. The tiny Mrs Traquair was forced reluctantly to employ a male assistant for some of the tricky bits. \"[He has] no more sense of feeling than wood,\" she groaned to Willie in April 1896. \"I felt inclined to push him off the scaffolding a day or two ago for injuring the profile of two angels.\" Mrs Traquair's own figures have the fragile, translucent beauty found in Botticelli and the corridors of superior nursing homes. \"When potential donors walk in, you see their jaws drop,\" says Rosemary Mann, secretary of the Mansfield Traquair Trust, which for the past seven years has been fighting to rescue the murals for posterity. In many ways the trust's achievement has matched Mrs Traquair's. After the Catholic Apostolics vacated the building in 1959, it fell into the hands of the Baptists and then the Edinburgh Brick Company, which wanted to turn it into offices. In a splendid irony the developer's architect, Stewart Brown, swapped horses and began campaigning for the building's preservation. A 16-month programme to convert the church's sizable basement into a headquarters for the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations begins in late spring. The main body of the church will become an exhibition and performance space. Restoration of the murals will begin once the walls have dried out. Mrs Traquair's reputation as a brilliant miniaturist - a book she illuminated recently sold for \u00a333,000 - has hitherto overshadowed the public art to which she attached so much importance. In 1891 she complained bitterly to Willie about the local Sick Children's Hospital's plan to demolish the exquisite consolatory mural she had painted five years earlier for its mortuary. \"They, the horrible Edinburgh little handful of bigots who form the directors of the hospital want to pull it down,\" she wrote. \"I feel as if my pet child was to be murdered.\" The directors did relent, and the plaster panels were painstakingly transported by horse and cart to the new mortuary, where they remain available for inspection today. Or almost available. Modern hospitals must contend with modern sensibilities. Mrs Traquair's sweet souls whizzing in tiny firepods past sinister snakes and soft-skinned angels are now shrouded by white curtains. \"Too many parents found them traumatising,\" a hospital spokesman shrugs. Phoebe Traquair's murals can be seen by prior arrangement with the Mansfield Traquair Trust (0131-557 1856).",

Nice to think that Argentina - \"Very like Ireland,\" says Gordon, \"except hotter and everyone's better-looking\" - is indirectly subsidising a key slice of the London fringe. </p> <p>Gordon is the latest in a long line of young directors - starting with Lou Stein and including Stephen Daldry, Giles Croft, Laurence Boswell and David Farr - who have made the Gate the most trail-blazing theatre in London. They have done this by exploring the international repertory and constantly re-inventing the space - all on a virtual shoestring. But there's more to Gordon than a total dedication to the Gate's survival: there's a mixture of charm, chutzpah and a great desire to learn. In the next 12 months he'll be working alongside his illustrious mentors, Peter Brook and Peter Hall, on major projects. Above his desk, you even a find a picture of him with the two Peters, looking like their mischievous grandson. Needless to say, it was Gordon who set up the photograph. </p> <p>But who exactly is Mick Gordon? Like Kenneth Branagh, he comes from Belfast Protestant stock and even at 17 saw the potential in both taking advice from his elders and seizing the initiative. \"I started acting at school,\" he says. \"I got into the National Youth Theatre and at the same time was asked by Unesco to go and teach in Poland. My headmaster told me there was going to be a revolution in Eastern Europe and that I'd be mad not to go. So I did and worked with a theatre teacher who took me everywhere from Krakow to Gdansk. That's when I fell in love with Polish theatre. </p> <p>\"I came back, got a great first in history at Oxford, and was asked to do academia. But I love being with people - I'd go insane being by myself in libraries. I didn't do mainstream theatre at Oxford. Instead I got my eccentric friends together to do a jazz Alice in Wonderland and a musical blending The Jungle Book and the case of Rodney King [the young black man filmed being beaten by police in LA]. We did this at the Oxford Playhouse after I left in 1992, where it was seen by someone from Welsh National Opera. They asked me to work on a Cinderella project.\" </p> <p>Gordon claims he suddenly found himself described as a director without knowing what the term meant. His answer was to lock himself away and read all the theories he could lay his hands on. \"I fell in love with Peter Brook's soul-searching, as many people have done,\" he says. \"I love all that stuff in search of a god. I thought 'I've really got to meet this man', so I moved down to London.\" </p> <p>In 1996 - after a hectic few years directing with a small opera company in Holland Park and Hong Kong, and using his salary to subsidise his own fringe projects at BAC - he won the first bursary as director on attachment to the National Theatre Studio. That brought him even closer to his heroes. </p> <p>\"While I was working at the Studio, Peter Brook called up and summoned a very elite posse of directors - Simon McBurney, Katie Mitchell, Deborah Warner, Gerry Mulgrew - to come and do some workshops in Paris. I was working with Simon at the time on The Caucasian Chalk Circle and asked if I could come. </p> <p>\"On the train over I was very frightened about meeting Brook. I think it was in case I met him and realised I'd never be as good as him. But when we did meet I realised that jealousy is nonsensical. He taught me that the only thing you can do excellently is be yourself. That's where your work will come from. </p> <p>\"I was the naughty grandchild. I got away with blue murder. We were talking about film and I said to Peter: 'You wanted to be George Lucas and Steven Spielberg but you were no good at it. You happen to be just the best theatre director in the world. Well done. Hard luck.' But what I love about Peter is his ceaseless questioning and his enlightened selfishness - his belief that everything must be dedicated to the task in hand.\" </p> <p>Gordon's own outstanding productions since taking over the Gate in the summer of 1998 - including La Tempte, Volunteers, Intimate Death and Marathon - have certainly had a distinct Brookian stamp. But he had to discover for himself how to run the theatre. \"My great dream was to open up the Gate, which is why we took Salome on tour,\" he says. \"I looked into the possibilities of buying the pub and taking over the Coronet Cinema in Notting Hill Gate, as Stephen Daldry had done before me. But it came to me one night that if it's not this pocket-sized passion-machine over a pub, then it's not the Gate any more. I had to go round the world to fall in love with the girl next door, but that's the truth of it.\" </p> <p>Instead, Gordon has squeezed more money out of the London Arts Board (the grant is now \u00a353,000) and temporarily found a way of paying actors by launching a five-play season - Remembering the Future - in partnership with the Royal National Theatre Studio. Even so, the Gate runs on the tightest of budgets. Its permanent staff of five each earn \u00a37,000 a year; Gordon's Argentinian work means he has gone off salary, enabling them to employ an extra director. But the Gate still has to raise \u00a3170,000 a year, and this year it's \u00a320,000 short. Like all the directors I've interviewed recently - including Ian Rickson at the Royal Court and Jonathan Kent and Ian McDiarmid at the Almeida - Gordon spends a lot of time taking potential benefactors out to dinner. Directing now seems to be as much about eating as it is about putting on plays. </p> <p>Gordon's astonishing season takes in Hawaiian, Australian, Turkish-American and Argentinian plays. He even has Peter Hall directing an Italian play, Cuckoos, about a man and woman stuck in a sexually compromising position; having early in his career directed a play about a couple eternally waiting, Sir Peter is now doing one about a pair endlessly coming. \"Rude and naughty\" is how Mick Gordon describes it. In return for Hall working at the Gate, Gordon will assist Hall on the 10-play John Barton marathon, Tantalus, which opens this autumn in America before touring Europe. </p> <p>Gordon, who will leave the Gate in mid-2001, claims he doesn't have a career plan - he's no Michael Heseltine sketching out his future on a dinner napkin. All the same, this year alone he'll be directing in Notting Hill and Buenos Aires, working with Hall in America and with Brook on a new Shakespearean project in Paris. He also has a film idea in development. But, if he is a rising directorial star, it is partly because he has the ability to learn from the right masters: he has absorbed Brook's notion of theatre as an unending spiritual quest and Hall's mix of organisational skill and textual fervour. I'd lay odds that Mick Gordon will be soon be a major international player.</p>",

Their latest installation, Wall of Death, also sets out to subvert the conventions of the traditional chase. And there are two key aspects to its composition. </p> <p>The first is the wall of death itself. At three metres high and 12 metres in diameter, this wooden-panelled replica of the perilous fairground feature, where a motorcyclist must maintain a certain speed to prevent his bike dropping from the wall, provides, says Ellard, \"an architectural space within which you're trapped, immersed within the work\". </p> <p>The structure also serves as a 360 cycloramic screen, and thereby invokes the early cinematic practices of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers in the late-19th century. Inside, a dual video-projector, the second key component, whirs overhead. As it revolves, it beams two diametrically opposed ovals of light around the walls from left to right. In the darkness, they look like searchlights. They are, in effect, moving screens. </p> <p>Suddenly, engines rev, sirens wail, and a shout is lost beneath squealing tyres, as footage from classic 70s film car chases is shown within the ovals. (I spotted extracts from The Driver, The French Connection and Vanishing Point.) </p> <p>\"The car chase seems to us to be an exemplary moment within the history of cinema as spectacle,\" says Ellard. \"And, prior to Jaws or Star Wars, there was a period when the car chase was what cinema seemed to be doing particularly well.\" </p> <p>Each sample has been carefully treated in terms of resolution, brightness and contrast, and then edited in order to isolate the subject and object of the pursuit. One screen shows the pursuer, the other the pursued. And they stalk each other around the walls. </p> <p>\"It's difficult to watch both screens and impossible to track them simultaneously,\" says Ellard. \"So there is an act of selection, of trying to keep up.\" You're not helped by the fact that the six speakers alternate the wheel-spins and engine noises between the two screens. \"In a sense,\" says Ellard, \"the viewer is involved in the chase.\" </p> <p>It's quite disorienting, this complicity, especially as there are other people shuffling about beside you trying to fathom their own approach. Even if you do manage to glimpse the two screens in quick succession, don't expect to piece together a continuous narrative. </p> <p>\"Although the films sometimes got the better of us,\" says Ellard, \"our intention was to show the pursuer and the pursued going round the same corner at the same time.\" </p> <p>Which should confuse you even more. For here, as in Calvino's story, \"neither pursuers nor pursued can be distinguished\". The effect is unsettling, and there are many eerie moments in the 14 one-minute loops (seven per screen). </p> <p>In one sequence, you see a ruby-red pick-up truck in an underground car park. It is stationary, its lights off. You track it around the walls as it remains still. This combination of movement (the film, and you following it) and stasis (the vehicle) is uncanny. </p> <p>Meanwhile, on the opposite screen, a flame-licked sports car screeches round the same gloomy car park, seemingly oblivious to the other vehicle's whereabouts. Then the truck's headlights come on and it creeps forward. It accelerates and both vehicles speed around their own screens. You provide the link that unites them in a chase. </p> <p>It's a sequence that exploits the full dramatic potential of the dual-screen format, while meeting the artists' aim of creating \"a non-narrative spectacular\". Wall of Death challenges our assumption of a space-time continuum - just as the Lumi\u00e8re brothers' head-on film of a train pulling into a station apparently prompted those in the front row to jump out of the way. </p> <p>The prolonging of suspense is central to Wall of Death, both here and in the fairground original. Ellard agrees that both projects are about \"the deferral of conclusions. If not death-defying, then the defying of gravity or logic or the expectation of what is possible.\" </p> <p>Only once in the sequences do the pursuer and pursued appear in the same frame. To show the denouement of the films - usually a fatal crash or shooting - would be to go against the existentialist spirit of the piece: to keep going without purpose or resolution. </p> <p>The pursuits, though, are not all confined to vehicles. One of the best sequences shows a sweaty Gene Hackman chasing a man on foot down side-streets and subways. You hear agitated mumblings, heavy breathing, the rap of urgent footsteps on concrete. These sounds are sometimes slowed down or echoed to give a chilling feel of a fugitive urban existence. And it's quite alienating as you stand there in the darkness, somewhere in a city yourself. </p> <p>The artists' most recent project opened at the end of last year. It's a permanent public sculpture for the A13 in Barking. At a major traffic intersection, at the height of a flyover, they have erected 75 tall, stainless steel needles peaked with runway landing lights. The idea, says Ellard, is to give drivers the impression that they are \"skating across the surface of a blue plateau of light\". </p> <p>It sounds enticing, though presumably you aren't encouraged to chase the car in front.</p> <p>Wall of Death is at the Paper Bag Factory, 165 Childer Street, London SE8, from February 4-27.

Meanwhile, on the opposite screen, a flame-licked sports car screeches round the same gloomy car park, seemingly oblivious to the other vehicle's whereabouts. Then the truck's headlights come on and it creeps forward. It accelerates and both vehicles speed around their own screens. You provide the link that unites them in a chase. It's a sequence that exploits the full dramatic potential of the dual-screen format, while meeting the artists' aim of creating \"a non-narrative spectacular\". Wall of Death challenges our assumption of a space-time continuum - just as the Lumi\u00e8re brothers' head-on film of a train pulling into a station apparently prompted those in the front row to jump out of the way. The prolonging of suspense is central to Wall of Death, both here and in the fairground original. Ellard agrees that both projects are about \"the deferral of conclusions. If not death-defying, then the defying of gravity or logic or the expectation of what is possible.\" Only once in the sequences do the pursuer and pursued appear in the same frame. To show the denouement of the films - usually a fatal crash or shooting - would be to go against the existentialist spirit of the piece: to keep going without purpose or resolution. The pursuits, though, are not all confined to vehicles. One of the best sequences shows a sweaty Gene Hackman chasing a man on foot down side-streets and subways. You hear agitated mumblings, heavy breathing, the rap of urgent footsteps on concrete. These sounds are sometimes slowed down or echoed to give a chilling feel of a fugitive urban existence. And it's quite alienating as you stand there in the darkness, somewhere in a city yourself. The artists' most recent project opened at the end of last year. It's a permanent public sculpture for the A13 in Barking. At a major traffic intersection, at the height of a flyover, they have erected 75 tall, stainless steel needles peaked with runway landing lights. The idea, says Ellard, is to give drivers the impression that they are \"skating across the surface of a blue plateau of light\". It sounds enticing, though presumably you aren't encouraged to chase the car in front. Wall of Death is at the Paper Bag Factory, 165 Childer Street, London SE8, from February 4-27.

It takes time to get one's bearings but, once one does, a poignantly lyrical ballad unfolds. </p> <p>The writer, Philip Kan Gotanda, based the play on his aunt, who here becomes the storyteller. Yachiyo lives among the cane-cutters on a remote Hawaiian island (Hawaii, one should remember, was annexed by the United States in 1898 and heavily populated by Asian immigrants). Her family is extremely poor so they send the 16-year-old to stay with a potter and his wife on a neighbouring island, to learn a trade and possibly find a husband. </p> <p>Yachiyo, who has a boyfriend back home heavily involved in militant protests against the American landowners, falls in love with the elderly Japanese potter, with foreseeably tragic consequences. </p> <p>Gotanda's 75-minute play, as I see it, is about a heroine caught between two violently contrasting worlds and traditions. Back home she cuts dresses out of a mail-order catalogue and supports her unionist boyfriend. Once she goes to live with the aged Takamura and his wife, however, she is involved in Japanese tea ceremonies and reverence for the ancient art of ceramics. Yachiyo suffers the classic plight of the immigrant caught between two cultures: even her thwarted love for Takamura seems like a nostalgic throwback to her ancient Japanese roots. What strikes one is the gentle, faintly ironic tone of Gotanda's writing, and the sense of cruelly impending fate. Throughout the play Takamura's neglected wife tells a story, with the aid of dolls, of a beautiful young girl destroyed by love: in effect, the same story we see enacted in real life. </p> <p>James Kerr's production, played out on a slatted, wooden stage lit from below and against a background of oriental screens, has the quality of a remembered dream. </p> <p>The doubling of roles initially causes confusion, but there are powerful performances from Inika Leigh Wright, making her professional debut, as the love-smitten, yearning Yachiyo, from Togo Igawa as the stern, grizzled, spiritually weak potter, and from Helene Patarot as his wife, who has suffered a lifetime's betrayal and humiliation. </p> <p>It is a strange play, but one that paints a moving picture of female isolation and that gradually enfolds one in its tragic lyricism. </p> <p> Box office: 0171-229 0706. Until February 19</p>",

Her family is extremely poor so they send the 16-year-old to stay with a potter and his wife on a neighbouring island, to learn a trade and possibly find a husband. Yachiyo, who has a boyfriend back home heavily involved in militant protests against the American landowners, falls in love with the elderly Japanese potter, with foreseeably tragic consequences. Gotanda's 75-minute play, as I see it, is about a heroine caught between two violently contrasting worlds and traditions. Back home she cuts dresses out of a mail-order catalogue and supports her unionist boyfriend. Once she goes to live with the aged Takamura and his wife, however, she is involved in Japanese tea ceremonies and reverence for the ancient art of ceramics. Yachiyo suffers the classic plight of the immigrant caught between two cultures: even her thwarted love for Takamura seems like a nostalgic throwback to her ancient Japanese roots. What strikes one is the gentle, faintly ironic tone of Gotanda's writing, and the sense of cruelly impending fate. Throughout the play Takamura's neglected wife tells a story, with the aid of dolls, of a beautiful young girl destroyed by love: in effect, the same story we see enacted in real life. James Kerr's production, played out on a slatted, wooden stage lit from below and against a background of oriental screens, has the quality of a remembered dream. The doubling of roles initially causes confusion, but there are powerful performances from Inika Leigh Wright, making her professional debut, as the love-smitten, yearning Yachiyo, from Togo Igawa as the stern, grizzled, spiritually weak potter, and from Helene Patarot as his wife, who has suffered a lifetime's betrayal and humiliation. It is a strange play, but one that paints a moving picture of female isolation and that gradually enfolds one in its tragic lyricism. Box office: 0171-229 0706. Until February 19",

Surrounded by controversy recently after the Pru's management clinched a deal with BoS to sell insurance in NatWest's branches if its bid succeeds, the fund management team at the Pru is expected to guard its independence zealously. Mercury Asset Management and Schroders, the next two largest and potentially influential shareholders in NatWest, were also keeping close counsel last night. However, Standard Life, the fifth largest investor with a 2.66% stake, was prepared to reveal that it is unlikely to support NatWest's revamped management team. The votes from \"index-tracking\" firms Legal &amp; General - which had it not been for the two bids would now be part of NatWest - and Barclays Global Investors will also be key. They own around 2.6% of NatWest each and had been the subject of speculation that they might end up backing any consensus view which emerged. However, L&amp;G insisted last night that it had not yet decided which of the outcomes to back. Marian Collins, the director responsible for corporate governance at Barclays Global Investors, refuted any market speculation that as an index tracker any charm offensive by the three camps would be wasted on her. \"We will make a truly active decision on what is in the best interests of our shareholders,\" she said. Even at Phillips &amp; Drew, where the fund managers have been taking an active role in shaking up the boards of underperforming companies, a director was prepared to admit that they had been \"impressed\" at the defence NatWest had put up. It has never made a secret of its admiration of Bank of Scotland, however, as it was once the owners of a 15% stake bought when Standard Life reduced its holding four years ago. The director would give nothing away as to whether that might count for something in the way P&amp;D cast its vote. \u0095 Changes to Barclays' management team emerged yesterday Gary Dibb joins the executive committee as director of strategic planning and corporate development. Tim Shepheard-Walwyn joins in Marchfrom Swiss bank UBS as group risk director, replacing Alan Brown who is retiring.",

The media is full of them: race discrimination, sex discrimination, massive pay-outs, bosses at the mercy of the \"compensation culture\". </p> <p>But Aisling Sykes didn't find it easy. Earlier this month, she won her case of unfair dismissal against a leading City bank whose lawyers tried to ruin her reputation. Belinda Coote had to fight leisure giant Granada for more than six years just to get a reference. Bhaggie Patel almost lost her baby because of the stress of bringing a race discrimination case. Try telling these women that going to an employment tribunal is easy. </p> <p>Coote, 38, first brought a sex discrimination case against Granada Hospitality in September 1993 when she lost her job as general manager of a bowling centre after getting pregnant. The claim was settled and she left by mutual agreement, but when she started to apply for new jobs and employment agencies wanted a reference, Granada failed to supply one. </p> <p>She took them to a subsequent tribunal, claiming their refusal to give references was in retaliation. Initially her claim failed but she took it to the European Court of Justice which ruled in her favour in 1998; last week she finally won what is a landmark case and \u00a3195,000 in compensation. The scars, however, will take a long time to heal. </p> <p>\"It was something I had to do,\" Coote says. \"I could not get a reference, so I could not get a job. One of the reasons I settled the first case was because I didn't want to jeopardise my career by being labelled a trouble-maker. I still wonder if I'm in a no-win situation.\" She has never returned to the leisure industry. \"Granada is such a big part of it, if you're knocked out, how do you get back?\" She has moved into business development, but believes she has not been as successful as she should have been. </p> <p>\"It has changed my life completely,\" she says. \"I still have a facade of confidence, but it's very brittle. I'm not as sure as I used to be. You can't go for six or seven years with someone questioning your integrity and ability without it having a lasting effect. I have lost years of my career path. I was doing an MSc, I wanted to get into a more strategic position. I suspect I will never make up that ground.\" </p> <p>Would she advise others to pursue a claim? \"If you feel strongly enough, you should damn well do it. But be prepared for a very rocky road.\" </p> <p>Many of us do feel strongly enough, it seems. As employees have become increasingly aware of their rights, the number of claims before employment tribunals has shot up, from 48,817 in 1989 to 146,630 for the period from September 1998 to August 1999. Around 40% are settled by the conciliation service Acas, 30% are withdrawn and the rest go to tribunal. A raft of new legislation, including the introduction of the minimum wage, has increased pressure on an already creaking system. </p> <p>Aisling Sykes, 39, lost a claim for unlawful indirect sexual discrimination but last month won an unfair dismissal case against City bank JP Morgan, after being sacked soon after she became pregnant with her fourth child. She had been warned it would be tough, but hadn't realised quite how tough. \"It's intensely personal. What you are hoping is that people will believe you. What they are trying to do is a character assassination.\" </p> <p>Lawyers even contacted nanny agencies she had used in order to gather information on her. \"Halfway through the cross-examination,\" she recalls, \"I sat there thinking, why don't I just get up and walk away? They will rake over everything, trawl through performance reviews for every year you've been there. It's horrible, a massively uneven fight.\" </p> <p>The day she won, she told the press she had committed \"professional suicide. You have to think you are not going to get the same job again.\" </p> <p>Would she discourage others from going to tribunal? \"You have to be incredibly confident about what you are saying. If you are trying to spin a lie, do not even attempt to go in there. It's very hard to win any case. You have to be a strong character and incredibly patient. It's a huge strain and it involves your whole family.\" </p> <p>While sex discrimination cases get a reasonably sympathetic hearing in the media, there is still suspicion around race discrimination cases. The Daily Mail, for example, has highlighted the story of Tahir Hussain who, after being turned down for jobs, has made a series of claims to employment tribunals, in a strategic attempt to expose widespread discrimination. </p> <p> According to Chris Myant of the Commission for Racial Equality, however, no one who has been through a race discrimination case would willingly do it again. \"We do not publicise a lot of cases because the people have gone through hell in the first place, hell in the tribunal reliving it, having their word doubted and their reputation smeared. They can't take going through the same thing in the media.\" </p> <p>Bhaggie Patel, 38, would definitely do it again. She brought a case of racial discrimination after a job for which she was better qualified was given to a white woman. The tribunal ruled in her favour and she was given \u00a32,000. </p> <p>Fair compensation? It is hard to say: the first day of the tribunal, Patel, who was seven months pregnant, was rushed to hospital after her waters broke. Her daughter was born two days later, weighing just 3.5lb, and spent a month in an incubator. The doctors put it down to stress. \"It was never easy,\" Patel says. \"But if you believe you've been discriminated against, I'd say pursue your case.\" </p> <p>Bolton is a small place and as Patel adds: \"I knew a lot of those involved. The woman who got the job was my colleague's partner. It was like challenging all these people and not knowing if the system would work.\" </p> <p>There have been professional consequences, too. Patel feels she now has a label - a bit of a trouble-maker. \"It's there in the background. But I've got to make the most of what I've got and get on with my life.\" She is now manager for a social care agency. </p> <p>It's not easy to bring a discrimination case. Your life will be put under a microscope, your career may be blown out of the water. But these women shared a sense of moral outrage that propelled them into court. We should be grateful such people exist.</p>",

The handsets retail for around \u00a3129.99. </p> <p>Pre-tax profits for the full year at Nokia, Europe's largest company, were up 57% on sales of almost 20bn euros - 48% ahead of the previous year. </p> <p>Mr Ollila said he expected the number of mobile phone users globally would break the 1bn barrier by the end of 2002, compared with 480m at the end of last year. </p> <p>The company said that of the 275m handsets sold globally in 1999, 78.5m had been pro duced by Nokia, representing a market share of 28.5%. </p> <p>American manufacturer Motorola sold 50m phones last year and Ericsson 31m. Ericsson is expected to launch its first WAP phone in Britain in the next few months. </p> <p>Nokia, however, is expected to come under added pressure from manufacturers outside the big three as other firms identify the opportunities in the market. </p> <p>Siemens, Philips, Samsung and Mitsubishi are expected to make inroads, according to a note from investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. </p> <p>Increasing competition would weigh heavily on margins, which would fall from last year's 20.5% as Nokia jostles for share, the group said. </p> <p>Mr Ollila also confirmed a recent meeting with Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, to discuss ways of stimulating the market for wireless internet access. </p> <p>The Helsinki-based company, however, would not become directly involved in the provision of content. \"We have our plate full of stuff, there is no way we would go into the content side,\" Mr Ollila said. </p> <p>Nokia also announced the $335m (\u00a3208.1m) acquisition of California-based Network Alchemy, which provides a software platform for secure online trading. </p> <p>The group's mobile handset division showed operating profits of just over \u20ac1bn - up from 581m euros a year ago.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone maker, yesterday said it was shipping \"hundreds of thousands\" of internet enabled handsets a week to meet intense demand as it reported record pre-tax profits for last year of 3.8bn euros (\u00a32.3bn). Chief executive Jorma Ollila predicted replacement handsets would account for up to 80% of sales next year compared to 40% in 1999 as interest in wireless access explodes. Nokia has stolen a march on rivals with its 7110 model wireless application protocol or WAP phone, which has been in short supply since its launch last November. The handsets retail for around \u00a3129.99. Pre-tax profits for the full year at Nokia, Europe's largest company, were up 57% on sales of almost 20bn euros - 48% ahead of the previous year. Mr Ollila said he expected the number of mobile phone users globally would break the 1bn barrier by the end of 2002, compared with 480m at the end of last year. The company said that of the 275m handsets sold globally in 1999, 78.5m had been pro duced by Nokia, representing a market share of 28.5%. American manufacturer Motorola sold 50m phones last year and Ericsson 31m. Ericsson is expected to launch its first WAP phone in Britain in the next few months. Nokia, however, is expected to come under added pressure from manufacturers outside the big three as other firms identify the opportunities in the market. Siemens, Philips, Samsung and Mitsubishi are expected to make inroads, according to a note from investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. Increasing competition would weigh heavily on margins, which would fall from last year's 20.5% as Nokia jostles for share, the group said. Mr Ollila also confirmed a recent meeting with Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, to discuss ways of stimulating the market for wireless internet access. The Helsinki-based company, however, would not become directly involved in the provision of content. \"We have our plate full of stuff, there is no way we would go into the content side,\" Mr Ollila said. Nokia also announced the $335m (\u00a3208.1m) acquisition of California-based Network Alchemy, which provides a software platform for secure online trading. The group's mobile handset division showed operating profits of just over \u20ac1bn - up from 581m euros a year ago.",

Shakespeare is not so much travestied as cogently distilled along neoclassical lines - aptly so for a composer who, though regarded as a Romantic, was largely drawn to the theatre of Voltaire and Racine. As for the three tenors, Covent Garden has unquestionably found them - and boy can they sing. </p> <p>Glamorisation of the tenor voice was what both Verdi and Rossini were about when it came to giving the Moor of Venice musical flesh, but where Verdi demands clarion lung power, Rossini lets his Otello seduce, enchant and rave over the fearsome extreme of two-and-a-half octaves. Bruce Ford negotiates this terrifying range with consummate ease and minimal showiness, underpinning his vocalism with a sense of volcanic emotion. </p> <p>It's a strong performance, but he's not ultimately the star of the show. Pride of place goes to the Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Florez. He's cast as Rodrigo, a conflation of Cassio and his Shakespearian namesake. Rossini endows the object of Otello's jealously with a vocal allure and prowess that exceed his own. The tessitura is implacably high, the coloratura treacherous. Florez spins it out with a staggering perfection of tone. A very great tenor has finally arrived. Octavio Arevalo's Iago completes the triumvirate. His music is less florid, its punchy simplicity an apt catalyst for his victims' spectacular emotionalism. Arevalo is impressive, reedily serpentine, a nasty piece of work. </p> <p>Hearing this trio in action is imperative, but you have to put up with inequalities elsewhere. Mariella Devia's Desdemona isn't in their league. A once great bel canto singer, she's now past her best. Her phrasing remains unfailingly sensitive, but the tone is acidic. An ill-judged, interpolated top note in the act two finale was a horrid shriek, as if someone had put electrodes on her. The conductor, Gianluigo Gelmetti, is elegantly refined, but rarely intense enough. The production, by Pier Luigi Pizzi, badly misjudges the piece. Rossini keeps the action in Venice throughout, though the libretto, incorporating quotes from Dante, aligns the city's concentric canals with the circles of the Inferno and reminds us that this is a drama of lost souls played out on the brink of an abyss. Venice and Hell are both conspicuous by their absence, however. All we get is a series of insipid tableaux vivants against a backdrop of monotonous grey colonnades. Rossini - and those three glorious tenors - deserve something better. </p> <p>Until February 17. Box office: 0171-304 4000</p>",
