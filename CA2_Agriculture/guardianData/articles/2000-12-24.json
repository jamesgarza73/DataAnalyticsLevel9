In an over-holy production at the National, Simon Russell Beale was a wonder: witty, grave and powerfully intelligent. At the Globe, a fine and melancholy Mark Rylance had his second triumphant go at the part, and proved that this often-derided but vivacious space can be intimate as well as rousing. Peter Zadek's bold production, in German, at Edinburgh, made the centre of Elsinore a corrugated railway-truck, and cast a woman - Angela Winkler - in the title role: she played Hamlet like a lost child. And in Paris Peter Brook, with Adrian Lester as the Prince, created his own cut and re-ordered version: rapt and intense - a meditation on the play. </p> <p>The dispute of the year was about the National: was it falling to pieces? It hasn't been a clear-cut case: the quality of its productions see-sawed violently. There have been stinkers: the clumping Villains' Opera, a snail's pace Romeo and Juliet. But there have also been superb occasions: Trevor Nunn set a benchmark for future directors with his Redgrave-filled Cherry Orchard; Jeremy Sams brilliantly revived Michael Frayn's Noises Off. What's been lacking wasn't talent, but surprise and diversity. The National shouldn't be monolithic: it is, after all, three theatres. It should fuel arguments about the different things that are lively on the stage. Of course, it should go on producing musicals as well as straight plays. But it should also find room to acknowledge movement theatre, devised work, and the confessional and documentary accounts that are beginning to invigorate the stage. It has to do more than it did this year to champion new writers - and new directors. </p> <p>Some of the most stimulating dramas of 2000 began outside London; most were not staged in purpose-built theatres. In Edinburgh, Grid Iron Theatre company took over a children's playground for Decky Does a Bronco, a tale of child abuse and bullying, acrobatically enacted in the open air: adults sinisterly stuffed into children's clothing spun high in the air on a row of swings, with the grey terraces of the city co-opted as backdrop. </p> <p>This was a production which made you think about what it is that makes a stage. As did the vivid work of the Dublin-based Corn Exchange which brought its Car Show to Greenwich for the Docklands International Festival, setting four short plays in four cars -- with, in each case, an audience of three on the back seat, and a different cast of two (always terrific) actors in the front. The wing- mirrors of the vehicles served as miniature sets, reflecting the world outside. </p> <p>And at the Southwark Playhouse, The Woman Who Swallowed a Pin escorted the audience through and outside the theatre (originally a warehouse) in order to uncover the building's history and a woman's past. In doing so, it provided a prime example of the way in which a theatre can be used like a piece of origami, endlessly transforming itself to shape the sense of what is being said. </p> <p>The year's most illuminating director was Michael Grandage who - working with the designer Christopher Oram - brought magic to The Jew of Malta at the Almeida, to Passion Play at the Donmar - and to the Crucible in Sheffield, where he staged As You Like It, with Victoria Hamilton as a Rosalind who went straight to the heart. In each case, it was as if a veil between audience and actors was lifted away. </p> <p>The resurgence of the year came from the RSC where, after some patchy times, the decision to stage all Shakespeare's Histories - using different directors and designers, and all three of the Stratford theatres - was an inspired big idea.

      "body": "<p>It should be a much happier Valley this Christmas than two years ago, when a run of 11 games without a win effectively sealed Charlton's relegation. </p> <p>This victory, secured by Matty Svensson's early goal, ended a run of four games without a win that threatened to raise the ghosts of Christmas past. </p> <p>Indeed Alan Curbishley is already hoping he can start looking forward to next Christmas in the Premiership, and this victory was as important for Charlton's confidence as it was for the three-point gap they opened above Everton. </p> <p>'A lot has been said about what happened two years ago, when we had eight straight defeats and went 11 games without a win, but we always felt that this time we had enough about us to bounce back,' said the Charlton manager. </p> <p>'It was nice to get some points after the last few weeks and I would have settled for us to put on a shocking performance and win if that was what was needed.' </p> <p>His side started as brightly as they had done a fortnight ago against Manchester United. Jonatan Johansson almost put them ahead in the sixth minute when he lobbed the ball over Thomas Myhre but Michael Ball saved Everton by heading clear for a corner. However, it was a brief reprieve as Claus Jensen's in-swinger was headed into the far corner of the net by Svensson. </p> <p>Myhre, back to replace the injured Paul Gerrard, made a fine save to claw away a header from Richard Rufus, and then saved well when Svensson tried his luck with an acrobatic overhead shot from outside the penalty area. </p> <p>Everton did not really threaten the home goal until Duncan Ferguson was introduced as a substitute after 62 minutes. The big Scotsman has not played since being injured in the home win over Charlton in August, but he was soon back in his garrulous groove. He had barely been on the pitch a minute before he gave away a free-kick and was almost booked for disputing the decision. </p> <p>But his height and aggression clearly unsettled the Charlton defence and gave Everton a real chance of equalising, with Israeli striker Idan Tal going closest when his bicycle kick hit the woodwork.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It should be a much happier Valley this Christmas than two years ago, when a run of 11 games without a win effectively sealed Charlton's relegation. This victory, secured by Matty Svensson's early goal, ended a run of four games without a win that threatened to raise the ghosts of Christmas past. Indeed Alan Curbishley is already hoping he can start looking forward to next Christmas in the Premiership, and this victory was as important for Charlton's confidence as it was for the three-point gap they opened above Everton. 'A lot has been said about what happened two years ago, when we had eight straight defeats and went 11 games without a win, but we always felt that this time we had enough about us to bounce back,' said the Charlton manager. 'It was nice to get some points after the last few weeks and I would have settled for us to put on a shocking performance and win if that was what was needed.' His side started as brightly as they had done a fortnight ago against Manchester United. Jonatan Johansson almost put them ahead in the sixth minute when he lobbed the ball over Thomas Myhre but Michael Ball saved Everton by heading clear for a corner. However, it was a brief reprieve as Claus Jensen's in-swinger was headed into the far corner of the net by Svensson. Myhre, back to replace the injured Paul Gerrard, made a fine save to claw away a header from Richard Rufus, and then saved well when Svensson tried his luck with an acrobatic overhead shot from outside the penalty area. Everton did not really threaten the home goal until Duncan Ferguson was introduced as a substitute after 62 minutes. The big Scotsman has not played since being injured in the home win over Charlton in August, but he was soon back in his garrulous groove. He had barely been on the pitch a minute before he gave away a free-kick and was almost booked for disputing the decision. But his height and aggression clearly unsettled the Charlton defence and gave Everton a real chance of equalising, with Israeli striker Idan Tal going closest when his bicycle kick hit the woodwork.",

The whole experience, which most managers go through at some time or another, is very unpleasant and hurtful, and from has certainly made me more cynical about this business. When you get letters of vile abuse - not even signed - you realise what sort of people there are out there. You cannot help but take it personally, and it is even worse for your family and friends. </p> <p>My wife and family attend every game and probably took the abuse more personally than I did. </p> <p>I have been lucky enough to be able to turn our situation round, but it did not always look possible. It didn't start well when, on the day I was appointed last August, I had to appease a group of fans who could not understand why I was taking over from Steve Coppell, who was a hero to them for keeping the club going during all the upheaval last season. </p> <p>It was a similar situation a few years ago when I succeeded Martin O'Neill as manager of Wycombe Wanderers. He was an icon there, and consequently there was a lot of resentment towards me trying to impose new ideas. </p> <p>One of my biggest problems at Palace was that I had so little time in which to do it. The players were clearly unfit. I tried to introduce some of the things that I'd seen Jean Tigana do at Fulham, but the difference was that he'd been appointed in May and had so much more time to change things. </p> <p>Looking back, perhaps I tried to do too much, too soon, things like training twice a day, gym sessions, changing the players' diets, and so on. I had to show my hand early and one of my first jobs was to trim the squad of players who were not up to it as far as I was concerned. Unfortunately some of them were also some of the most influential, and subsequently became the most disruptive. </p> <p>It was only when we finally paid up contracts and got rid of them that we eliminated the problem. Expensive, yes, but it could have been far more costly to the club to let it fester. </p> <p>The chairman, Simon Jordan, backed me all the way and his support was and still is a huge factor. He made it absolutely clear that certain players were more at danger of being kicked out than me - that sharpened their minds. </p> <p>On the pitch, we had played quite well against some decent sides and had just not got the rub of the green, but we had also played badly and without much passion. I remember a defeat in that manner at Preston, the second game of our bad run. The fans started chanting for Coppell, and the comments and body language of the players told me that things were not right. </p> <p>I told them there and then that things would have to change, but it got worse. At that stage I could not even look at the league table - and hardly dared pick up the local paper. </p> <p>I was losing the support of fans who had previously argued my case, and after that Grimsby game, they'd had enough and wanted a change. And then two things happened_ I had it out with the players and went public with the criticism, which is not something I thought I'd ever do, and our luck started to change. </p> <p>The two may be related but whatever the reason, our fortunes improved. Next game, at Bolton, we came back to equalise with the last kick of the game. Suddenly there was hope that we might get the breaks we desperately needed. </p> <p>It started our run which including victories against Leicester and Sunderland, both good Premiership sides. Confidence came flooding back through the club to the fans and people are starting to talk about making the play-offs. </p> <p>That may be fanciful - but at least I can walk with pride among Palace's supporters - and dare to read the results pages again.</p>",

When applications closed, more than 40 people had applied. Of those, three or four are said to be good quality applicants. Although the IFC is meant to be independent, football's rulers fear the chairmanship might go to someone who will use it to investigate clubs and pursue fans' complaints with, for them, potentially uncomfortable zeal. Observer Sport revealed last week that FA chief executive Adam Crozier believed that appointing Richard Scudamore, his Premier League counterpart, as football's representative on the four-strong IFC selec tion panel would send out negative signals to supporters about the new body's integrity. Scudamore has persuaded Chris Smith, the Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, that new candidates should be approached in order to 'widen the field'. But this latest move in the long-running watchdog controversy may be part of a behind-the-scenes effort by football to block one of the handful of 'quality applicants' already identified because it fears he may be too independent-minded.",

The present side also, Ferguson controversially suggests, eclipses the earlier Busby teams, including the 1958 'Babes', simply because the Munich disaster robbed that side of the chance to fulfil their enormous potential. </p> <p>'This is the best side this club has ever had,' said Ferguson. 'I have spoken to Bobby about this a couple of times and he probably shares that opinion. </p> <p>'It is difficult to compare eras. But the number of games they have got, the media profile they have nowadays, these players handle it very well. The statistics point to that also. They have surpassed the '68 team.

Sir Matt Busby won two League titles, the FA Cup and, of course, the European Cup in a six-season period from 1963-68.

'I use the analogy that some people just want to go on a foreign holiday once in their life, they want to go to Spain to say they have been there and come back. That's it,' said Ferguson. </p> <p>'My players want to win, they have great pride, they are hungry. The hunger they have got is nothing to do with putting bread on the table or getting \u00a31 million in the bank. It is about trying to achieve things, and then strive for other things.

      "body": "<p>It is 1.45pm during the fag end of Italian summer time, and I have just smoked what I fervently believe to be my last cigarette. This is it; this is the moment when, after 30 years of smoking this infernal weed, I quit. No patches, no inhalers, no gum; just plenty of good old plain cold turkey - and the small fillip of a week's cruise around the coast of Italy from Rome to Venice aboard a five-masted luxurious sailing ship. </p> <p>They say that one good way of stopping smoking is to do something really indulgent to help keep your mind away from the nagging compulsion of the habit. Well, this is my indulgence - to be one of the 312 guests being pampered by the 163-strong crew of the Wind Surf. </p> <p>We are promised haute cuisine and fine wines, and no worries about keeping it all down as the ship has a unique computer-controlled ballasting system which prevents a heel of anything more than two to three degrees and limits the pitch and roll of the waves to a gentle rocking of the deck. </p> <p>We are promised 156 elegant en suite staterooms, each with a sea view, TV, video, CD player, fridge and phone. We are promised day rooms and lounges, and bars, of course: deck bars, pool bars, piano bars and more. We are promised hot tubs and cool pools and a gym and an open-air drop-down sports platform at the stern with snorkelling, scuba diving, sailboards, waters skis, kayaks and inflatables. </p> <p>But most of all we are promised the wide open ocean and strengthening winds snapping at seven enormous sails strung fore-and-aft from the masts that rise 204ft above us. And we are promised the salty Mediterranean sting of sunlit days and star-pricked nights framing lashings and lashings of fresh, fresh air, untrammelled by the ghastly rasp of a gasper. </p> <p>There is a Sheraton hotel on the outskirts of Rome, not far from Fiumicino airport, that through no fault of its own is the final place of infamy in my grimy tar-encrusted pantheon of smoking. Here the last snout was lit and seven minutes later stubbed out on the floor of the poolside bar when those travelling to Civitavecchia to embark the Wind Surf were summoned to their coaches for the hour's drive to the little town being developed as Rome's new cruise terminal. </p> <p>In late September the power of the summer sun is waning but still it is strong enough to radiate waves of drowsiness through the windows of the bus as it passes through the un- inspiring countryside north-west of Rome. But then, as we turn off the main drag and wind down a small slope leading to the port, Wind Surf's magnificent masts finger their way above the horizon. Fifteen minutes later and we are handing over our passports, having our tickets checked and baggage labelled before climbing the gangway aboard. </p> <p>We 300-plus are quickly processed and having marked our nests for the next seven days are just as quickly back on deck to line the rails for our departure. With bow thrusters and a couple of tugs, Wind Surf seems to be able to turn her 17,745 gross tons in little over her 617ft length, and soon we are heading past the last mole and out into the open sea. Ah, this is the life - standing almost at the bows, wind in my hair, glass of champagne in one hand and, oh no, a gaping void in the other where the cigarette should be. It's my first pang of craving, the first of so many. </p> <p>But then, as was often to happen on this trip, something unexpected slew the wicked demon of addiction perched just out of sight on my left shoulder and whispering in my ear: 'Go on, have one. What's the difference? One's not going to make a difference. Go on, you're on holiday. You'll love it.' This time it was the unfurling of the sails as the wind speed indicators on the bridge passed the minimum 10 knots needed and the captain gave the order. </p> <p>Wind Surf may boast a crew of more than 160, but no one has to run up the rigging and out on to the yardarms to hang these sails. More than 90 per cent of the crew are here to look after every whim of the guests, and the few that don't directly - deck, bridge and engineroom officers and crew - are pretty well protected from the elements. On the bridge the captain gives the order and electric motors whir into life rotating the forestays of each mast around which a sail is wound while at the same time a small truck drags the aft end of the sail back along the hydraulic booms. In two minutes the sails are set, as they were more than half the time we were at sea. </p> <p>A few more glasses of champagne and, blow me, it's time for dinner, as in five-course dinner consisting, for instance, of an appetiser of a tower of smoked salmon with cr\u00e8me frache, followed by red onion soup, seared sea scallops with chive mashed potato, cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e and followed by coffee and petits fours. Five courses, every night; it meant that the post-prandial blow round the deck under the stars became obligatory if one wanted to a) maintain some level of basic fitness and b) cast out the ciggie demon. And so to bed, lured to sleep by the cosseting swell of the Tyrrhenian Sea. </p> <p>Our course for the next seven days would take us south-east from Civitavecchia to the tiny port of Amalfi in the Gulf of Salerno, south-south-easterly to Taormina in Sicily, a long run across the Ionian Sea north-east to Corfu, north-north-west into the Adriatic to picturesque Dubrovnik, north-west, threading through the hundreds of islands off the Dalmatian coast to the medieval town of Rab, and a final west-north-westerly hop across to Venice. </p> <p>But first there was breakfast to negotiate, taken al fresco on the top, or Star, deck of the ship. The Wind Surf, like its smaller sister sailing ships, the Wind Star, Wind Spirit and Wind Song, is American-owned, though crewed by mainly Indonesians and Filipinos with British and Norwegian officers. Prices are in dollars and pomposity is at a minimum. Dress is casual, though you could add 'elegant' to casual for dinner. </p> <p>One good thing about this is of course today's attitude towards smoking on the part of most Americans - if you do choose to do it, you are a pariah and are relegated to a small area topside at the stern with the dwindling band of the rest of your kind. If you don't do it you can join the happy smiling majority with the freedom to roam the ship or call in for a chat about our progress at the ever open bridge. </p> <p>Another good thing, as I was smokelessly saying, is breakfast: cereals, mounds of fruit, eggs cooked any way you want, hickory-smoked bacon, waffles, pancakes, French toast, freshly squeezed juice and brewed coffee. All is taken while the ship swings at anchor to the backdrop of whichever port while fantastically smart immigration officials spin out to clear us for landing. </p> <p>Once the officials give the green light, Wind Surf drops its own launches into the water and begins a regular tender service to the shore. At each port we visit, guided excursions are on offer - to Pompeii from Amalfi, to the Achillion Palace in Corfu, to the Konavle Valley for a traditional lunch outside Dubrovnik, for example. Alternatively, you hop ashore and make your own entertainment,. </p> <p>An unmissable excursion for me was to Mount Etna in Sicily, beginning as surprisingly few of us piled into buses on the quayside at Giardini Naxos, just below Taormina. (Actually, for me it had really started with a dawn call to watch our passage through the Straits of Messina followed by a brisk two-mile walk - five and half turns around the Bridge Deck equals one mile - to work off last night's dinner to make room for this morning's breakfast.) An hour later, we were pulling into a cable car station having climbed 6,250ft along tiny roads winding through old lava flows. The cable car lurches up a further 1,900ft before a fleet of four-wheel drive minibuses takes us through a black scorched moonscape to just under 10,000ft. </p> <p>Whenever I crave tobacco, I think of a trick our guide proudly showed us amid the swirling sulphrous mists and their faint stink of rotten eggs. 'Anyone have a cigarette?' she asked. Instinctively I put my hand in my pocket. Someone else came up with the goods. She lit one, and leaning down blew smoke towards a small indentation. Immediately there was a rancorous exhalation by the very blackened ground. I think of my lungs and my breath; as aversion therapy it's unbeatable. </p> <p>They say - them again - that the worst times when giving up smoking come in threes; three days, three weeks, three months, even three years. Well, the third day was awful. It was the day of the long reach across the Ionian Sea, so no port of call today. It started fine; breakfast, reading and sunbathing till lunch, then more sunbathing while the captain shut down the engines leaving us under canvas alone for three hours or more. It was wonderful and exhilarating to watch the prop wash disappear and feel the vessel ride the waves rather than plough through them. So good I thought I'd have a cigarette. No, banish the idea, but this time it wouldn't go. </p> <p>I don't know how I got through the rest of that day. I kidded myself that I could have a cigar after dinner but the cheapest one was 18 bucks (money is another good averter). But get through it I did, and the rest of the week, thanks to the magnificent indulgence of this gentle vessel and the attention of its dedicated crew. And thanks to the memory of it I got through the three-week watershed. And now, coming up to Christmas, pray for me, please. </p> <p>\u0095 Michael Holland's voyage was organised by Windstar Cruises, 77-79 Great Eastern Street, London EC2A 3HU; tel 020 7739 5414 ; fax 020 7729 1235; <a href=\"http://www.windstarcruises.com\">www.windstarcruises.com</a>.

A few more glasses of champagne and, blow me, it's time for dinner, as in five-course dinner consisting, for instance, of an appetiser of a tower of smoked salmon with cr\u00e8me frache, followed by red onion soup, seared sea scallops with chive mashed potato, cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e and followed by coffee and petits fours. Five courses, every night; it meant that the post-prandial blow round the deck under the stars became obligatory if one wanted to a) maintain some level of basic fitness and b) cast out the ciggie demon. And so to bed, lured to sleep by the cosseting swell of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Our course for the next seven days would take us south-east from Civitavecchia to the tiny port of Amalfi in the Gulf of Salerno, south-south-easterly to Taormina in Sicily, a long run across the Ionian Sea north-east to Corfu, north-north-west into the Adriatic to picturesque Dubrovnik, north-west, threading through the hundreds of islands off the Dalmatian coast to the medieval town of Rab, and a final west-north-westerly hop across to Venice. But first there was breakfast to negotiate, taken al fresco on the top, or Star, deck of the ship. The Wind Surf, like its smaller sister sailing ships, the Wind Star, Wind Spirit and Wind Song, is American-owned, though crewed by mainly Indonesians and Filipinos with British and Norwegian officers. Prices are in dollars and pomposity is at a minimum. Dress is casual, though you could add 'elegant' to casual for dinner. One good thing about this is of course today's attitude towards smoking on the part of most Americans - if you do choose to do it, you are a pariah and are relegated to a small area topside at the stern with the dwindling band of the rest of your kind. If you don't do it you can join the happy smiling majority with the freedom to roam the ship or call in for a chat about our progress at the ever open bridge. Another good thing, as I was smokelessly saying, is breakfast: cereals, mounds of fruit, eggs cooked any way you want, hickory-smoked bacon, waffles, pancakes, French toast, freshly squeezed juice and brewed coffee. All is taken while the ship swings at anchor to the backdrop of whichever port while fantastically smart immigration officials spin out to clear us for landing. Once the officials give the green light, Wind Surf drops its own launches into the water and begins a regular tender service to the shore. At each port we visit, guided excursions are on offer - to Pompeii from Amalfi, to the Achillion Palace in Corfu, to the Konavle Valley for a traditional lunch outside Dubrovnik, for example. Alternatively, you hop ashore and make your own entertainment,. An unmissable excursion for me was to Mount Etna in Sicily, beginning as surprisingly few of us piled into buses on the quayside at Giardini Naxos, just below Taormina. (Actually, for me it had really started with a dawn call to watch our passage through the Straits of Messina followed by a brisk two-mile walk - five and half turns around the Bridge Deck equals one mile - to work off last night's dinner to make room for this morning's breakfast.) An hour later, we were pulling into a cable car station having climbed 6,250ft along tiny roads winding through old lava flows. The cable car lurches up a further 1,900ft before a fleet of four-wheel drive minibuses takes us through a black scorched moonscape to just under 10,000ft. Whenever I crave tobacco, I think of a trick our guide proudly showed us amid the swirling sulphrous mists and their faint stink of rotten eggs. 'Anyone have a cigarette?' she asked. Instinctively I put my hand in my pocket. Someone else came up with the goods. She lit one, and leaning down blew smoke towards a small indentation. Immediately there was a rancorous exhalation by the very blackened ground. I think of my lungs and my breath; as aversion therapy it's unbeatable. They say - them again - that the worst times when giving up smoking come in threes; three days, three weeks, three months, even three years. Well, the third day was awful. It was the day of the long reach across the Ionian Sea, so no port of call today. It started fine; breakfast, reading and sunbathing till lunch, then more sunbathing while the captain shut down the engines leaving us under canvas alone for three hours or more. It was wonderful and exhilarating to watch the prop wash disappear and feel the vessel ride the waves rather than plough through them. So good I thought I'd have a cigarette. No, banish the idea, but this time it wouldn't go. I don't know how I got through the rest of that day. I kidded myself that I could have a cigar after dinner but the cheapest one was 18 bucks (money is another good averter). But get through it I did, and the rest of the week, thanks to the magnificent indulgence of this gentle vessel and the attention of its dedicated crew. And thanks to the memory of it I got through the three-week watershed. And now, coming up to Christmas, pray for me, please. \u0095 Michael Holland's voyage was organised by Windstar Cruises, 77-79 Great Eastern Street, London EC2A 3HU; tel 020 7739 5414 ; fax 020 7729 1235; www.windstarcruises.com.

      "body": "<p>If Ken Bates has a vision for English football, yesterday probably summed it up. Do Christmas shopping at the Chelsea Megastore, rest your legs watching a spot of football, do more shopping at the Chelsea Megastore. S and F: shopping and football - it's the Bates fantasy. </p> <p>Yesterday more fuel was added to it with the tills ringing and his team securing a relatively comfortable victory that sends them into the top half of the table. Now all they have to do is cure what the programme calls 'the curse of away'. </p> <p>Chelsea lined up in their now usual 3-4-2-1 formation with Frank Leboeuf slotted in at right-back. He looked lost initially but it was to prove to be a cunning ploy. </p> <p>But first, and briefly, Bradford threatened. A Benito Carbone free-kick was hesitantly punched away by Ed de Goey. A sharp free-kick from Dean Windass put Stuart McCall into a threatening position from which he failed to threaten. That was about as good as it got for Bradford. </p> <p>For now the Chelsea plan came into play. They would pass the ball prettily and it would eventually come to Lebeouf. He would then launch it accurately 40 or 50 yards to Eidur Gudjohnsen, Gustavo Poyet, Gianfranco Zola or Dennis Wise. In such a way the Bradford offside trap was rendered useless. </p> <p>And on 21 minutes Chelsea went ahead. The impressive Samule Dalla Bona released Gudjohnsen; his first shot was blocked by Gary Walsh, his second shot was blocked by Walsh, but the ball broke to Poyet who scored with ease. </p> <p>They should have doubled or trebled their lead. Zola created a one-on-one but failed to convert it. Then, after a clever build-up involving Poyet and Dalla Bona, he scuffed his shot just wide. The Chelsea machine never quite clicked. </p> <p>All the while, Ranieri looked on, standing neat and prim and proper, by the side of the dugout with his hands clasped behind his back. He and his sidekicks all wore heavy overcoats and resembled the Sopranos, dressed for a formal occasion, hanging around outside their favourite caf\u00e9, the one that serves suckling pig.

      "bodyText": "If Ken Bates has a vision for English football, yesterday probably summed it up. Do Christmas shopping at the Chelsea Megastore, rest your legs watching a spot of football, do more shopping at the Chelsea Megastore. S and F: shopping and football - it's the Bates fantasy. Yesterday more fuel was added to it with the tills ringing and his team securing a relatively comfortable victory that sends them into the top half of the table. Now all they have to do is cure what the programme calls 'the curse of away'. Chelsea lined up in their now usual 3-4-2-1 formation with Frank Leboeuf slotted in at right-back. He looked lost initially but it was to prove to be a cunning ploy. But first, and briefly, Bradford threatened. A Benito Carbone free-kick was hesitantly punched away by Ed de Goey. A sharp free-kick from Dean Windass put Stuart McCall into a threatening position from which he failed to threaten. That was about as good as it got for Bradford. For now the Chelsea plan came into play. They would pass the ball prettily and it would eventually come to Lebeouf. He would then launch it accurately 40 or 50 yards to Eidur Gudjohnsen, Gustavo Poyet, Gianfranco Zola or Dennis Wise. In such a way the Bradford offside trap was rendered useless. And on 21 minutes Chelsea went ahead. The impressive Samule Dalla Bona released Gudjohnsen; his first shot was blocked by Gary Walsh, his second shot was blocked by Walsh, but the ball broke to Poyet who scored with ease. They should have doubled or trebled their lead. Zola created a one-on-one but failed to convert it. Then, after a clever build-up involving Poyet and Dalla Bona, he scuffed his shot just wide. The Chelsea machine never quite clicked. All the while, Ranieri looked on, standing neat and prim and proper, by the side of the dugout with his hands clasped behind his back. He and his sidekicks all wore heavy overcoats and resembled the Sopranos, dressed for a formal occasion, hanging around outside their favourite caf\u00e9, the one that serves suckling pig. Stories that he can't speak English may be exaggerated for he had little difficulty in communicating his displeasure with his team, in particular, Marcel Desailly, who was the object of a couple of Ranieri tantrums. The game improved in the second half. A precise pass from Poyet played in Gudjohnsen, who shot against the bar. Suddenly there was life and passion in what had previously been a rather soporific encounter. With 25 minutes to go an injured Lebeouf made way for Morris thereby enabling Chelsea to field a three-quarters English midfield. It was the foreign quarter, however, that won it. Dalla Bona received the ball from Gudjohnsen just inside the Bradford half and jinked and jagged through their defence prior to stroking the ball into the net.

      "body": "<p>It was when I was handed a loaded shotgun that I realised I was all at sea - and there was more to being a ship's purser than I thought.True, the original definition of the term meant someone looking after the vessel's purse - in other words, controlling all the money on board. But a shotgun?</p> <p>That just shows you, I reasoned, how seriously they take the responsibilities of securing the cash and valuables on the good ship Hebridean Princess. But then, come to think of it, being the chief purser on this boat isn't like wearing a senior officer's uniform on any other ship either. Any more than the Hebridean Princess is like any other cruise ship. Everything about the Princess tells you it shouldn't work. Just imagine. It's a converted ferry boat. There are chintz curtains in every room. Some of those rooms have coronets of curtains over the bed - making them look like four-posters. There's even a fireplace in the main lounge. And all on a ship, cruising on the high seas.</p> <p>But it works marvellously. This is a luxury cruise ship sailing round the Western Isles of Scotland, and it's as beautiful as the surroundings. It is intimate in a way that big ships never are. No more than 48 people are on board at any one time - and, unlike the case on most luxury cruises, the passengers are nearly all British.</p> <p>You know the captain, Michael Hepburn, well enough to chat about the route. He is always around and says you are welcome on the bridge any time you want. You know the housekeeper, Amanda, by name because she is there every minute of the day, checking that the stewardesses have put the right amount of soap in your bathroom or that the brass rails are shining as brightly as the mirrors. Your waiters and waitresses know what you want the minute you sit at the tables facing the wide, high windows that always give you views, not just of the sea, but of the miles of islands, too.</p> <p>And you also know Andrew Quarry, the chief purser. Well, how could you not know him? You see him everywhere, too. A nice job, I thought. All the time on the ship, laughing and joking with the guests. Not passengers, but guests. As Captain Hepburn told me: 'Passengers are going somewhere; on the Hebridean Princess, we think they have already arrived.'</p> <p>That was a good enough reason to try the chief purser's job for size - if only for a day.</p> <p>'Put this apron ON,' Andrew told me. It was halfway through the day in which I had become a Quarry clone, and lunch was about to be served. I had no idea how creative I could be, portioning out the right amount of lamb on a bed of rice and without staining the edge of the plate. The couple sitting at the table next to ours - who earlier in the week had had no knowledge of my prowess - were particularly impressed. Andrew kept his view to himself. But then he's been at it for 11 years.</p> <p>Personally, I was mostly taken by the uniform. I imagined that achieving the exalted rank of chief purser - four rings on the immaculate black tunic - required not just experience in adding up the takings of the week and writing the \u00a35,000 weekly food bill, but also a due period of square bashing. </p> <p>Not at all. An ability to stand up without falling down during a force eight gale might be an advantage, but there was no need of any such requirement during the week of our stately trawl round the Scottish coast and the isles of Mull, Skye, Harris and Eriskay. And I did like that uniform.</p> <p>Starting at 7.30am was something that I tended to like rather less. And there were meetings to be had, decisions to be made, announcements to be broadcast, guests to be welcomed, the guide - Ian Conde (one of the best in the business) - to be asked for advice, food to be served, champagne to be poured, rooms to be visited.</p> <p>Then, it has to be admitted, Andrew Quarry isn't your average purser. Not simply because he wears a kilt on dress nights - 'the name is really Andrew McQuarry,' he assured me, a distinct advantage on the Hebrides run - but because this job involves being a combination of hotel manager, cruise director, maitre d' and, well, yes, purser.</p> <p>I had my first peek behind the scenes the day before I went on duty. Andrew allowed me into the kitchen - sorry, galley - as he was preparing a picnic.</p> <p>This wasn't your usual basket of sandwiches and warm beer. The ship docked on Mull where a coach was ready to transport people along some of the most picturesque roads in the British Isles (once the guests were off, the ship was sailing for the next three hours, so that it would be ready to meet them on their return). Andrew and the staff, meanwhile, had a minibus ready to follow the coach with a four-course lunch, served in a local hall.</p> <p>The lunch had been prepared on the ship - so had the soaps, towels and toilet rolls . 'We can't risk the toilets not being up to our standard,' he explained. Not just that. The wine was at just the right temperature. Diets were taken care of. Wheat-free, non-dairy, gluten-free, kosher, vegetarian, diabetic. The biggest problem that the chief purser had that day was a request from one of the guests. 'Do you have a toothpick?' he was asked. Andrew said he was afraid that he didn't.</p> <p>My first public assignment was to help steer a couple of charming Americans who wanted to know about the route we were taking. I tried to blind them with the science of charts and suchlike, but since I get lost on the M25, I had to hope against hope that they wouldn't be too worried about confusing the Isle of Skye with the Isle of Muck, which is precisely where I would have been if they ever found out.</p> <p>Then there were the coach companies. On the first stop of the day we had to be sure they were ready to provide the vehicles that would be taking the people on their tours round the islands, down to the beautiful beaches, up the mountains and to places like a tweed mill on the Isle of Harris, a salmon smokery and on to the nearest castles. They weren't the coaches we needed for this cruise, you understand. Those had been booked long before. I was acting on behalf of the Hebridean Princess, and planning for next year; the same coaches and the same dray on Skye, the one drawn by two huge horses, which makes the short trip from the dock and up the road to a nearby garden. I was satisfied that all would be well in 2001.</p> <p>There was a staff meeting. Someone reported seeing soot at the foot of the funnel. 'Clean it,' I said. My executive decision of the day. Later, I was informed the soot had gone. The power of a chief purser is amazing.</p> <p>I hadn't noticed two stains on the carpet in one of the cabins - sorry, 'staterooms'. That was one reason why I wasn't a full-time chief purser. Once they were pointed out, I suggested the carpet be taken out and cleaned when we docked the following Thursday. Instantly agreed.</p> <p>I went on deck. No more soot. Then, inside again, I examined the flowers. They looked fine. There were no cigarette ends lying around. What more could I ask for? To make sure that the food stocks were holding up, for one thing. They were. That's critical on a ship where no one is served frozen food. The Princess line's head office at Skipton, Yorkshire, had to be given a rundown of what the guests on this cruise liked. They wouldn't be given red meat if we knew they ate only fish or poultry. Diabetics would be sure to have sugar-free desserts prepared for them. Vegetarians wouldn't be offered, let alone served, anything they could not eat. They would be sure to serve only sparkling mineral water to those whose file said they required it. I am sure that if still water were supplied it would be a sacking offence.</p> <p>And then there was The Highlander, a gentleman who, dressed in traditional gear, came aboard one night after dinner and told the story of the Jacobite Rebellion. The fate of which, as far as he is concerned, was the great tragedy of the Scottish nation. He had to be phoned and booked for next year.</p> <p>My broadcasting experience proved invaluable when we tied up close to the grave of Flora Macdonald, heroine of Bonnie Prince Charlie's escape from the marauding Redcoats. 'Happy day,' I called on the ship's microphone, 'now the fun begins.' I thought Andrew looked a little shocked. Maybe he thought that the red blazer I habitually wore when I wasn't in uniform revealed some hitherto hidden experience at Butlin's. I assured him it didn't - and my fellow guests told me they appreciated the friendliness of it all.</p> <p>I thought that would be more successful than organising the clay-pigeon shoot on board the afternoon we were at sea. That was when I was handed the loaded shotgun. My military background - National Service, Royal Army Service Corps - could not help. In those days there were more bulls in the field next to the range than on my score card. But I had to set an example.</p> <p>First shot: into the blue. Second: a little too close to a real seagull for my liking, to say nothing of that of the seagull. And then the third one, a shot that will forever be recorded in the annals not just of the Hebridean Princess, but of the peace-loving Freedland family. A shot, carefully aimed - and one clay pigeon shatters in mid air. What a triumph. What an example to the ship's company. That's the moment I earn my four stripes.</p> <p>Next year's cruises on the Hebridean Princess start on 3 March.

But then, come to think of it, being the chief purser on this boat isn't like wearing a senior officer's uniform on any other ship either. Any more than the Hebridean Princess is like any other cruise ship. Everything about the Princess tells you it shouldn't work. Just imagine. It's a converted ferry boat. There are chintz curtains in every room. Some of those rooms have coronets of curtains over the bed - making them look like four-posters. There's even a fireplace in the main lounge. And all on a ship, cruising on the high seas. But it works marvellously. This is a luxury cruise ship sailing round the Western Isles of Scotland, and it's as beautiful as the surroundings. It is intimate in a way that big ships never are. No more than 48 people are on board at any one time - and, unlike the case on most luxury cruises, the passengers are nearly all British. You know the captain, Michael Hepburn, well enough to chat about the route. He is always around and says you are welcome on the bridge any time you want. You know the housekeeper, Amanda, by name because she is there every minute of the day, checking that the stewardesses have put the right amount of soap in your bathroom or that the brass rails are shining as brightly as the mirrors. Your waiters and waitresses know what you want the minute you sit at the tables facing the wide, high windows that always give you views, not just of the sea, but of the miles of islands, too. And you also know Andrew Quarry, the chief purser. Well, how could you not know him? You see him everywhere, too. A nice job, I thought. All the time on the ship, laughing and joking with the guests. Not passengers, but guests. As Captain Hepburn told me: 'Passengers are going somewhere; on the Hebridean Princess, we think they have already arrived.' That was a good enough reason to try the chief purser's job for size - if only for a day. 'Put this apron ON,' Andrew told me. It was halfway through the day in which I had become a Quarry clone, and lunch was about to be served. I had no idea how creative I could be, portioning out the right amount of lamb on a bed of rice and without staining the edge of the plate. The couple sitting at the table next to ours - who earlier in the week had had no knowledge of my prowess - were particularly impressed. Andrew kept his view to himself. But then he's been at it for 11 years. Personally, I was mostly taken by the uniform. I imagined that achieving the exalted rank of chief purser - four rings on the immaculate black tunic - required not just experience in adding up the takings of the week and writing the \u00a35,000 weekly food bill, but also a due period of square bashing. Not at all. An ability to stand up without falling down during a force eight gale might be an advantage, but there was no need of any such requirement during the week of our stately trawl round the Scottish coast and the isles of Mull, Skye, Harris and Eriskay. And I did like that uniform. Starting at 7.30am was something that I tended to like rather less. And there were meetings to be had, decisions to be made, announcements to be broadcast, guests to be welcomed, the guide - Ian Conde (one of the best in the business) - to be asked for advice, food to be served, champagne to be poured, rooms to be visited. Then, it has to be admitted, Andrew Quarry isn't your average purser. Not simply because he wears a kilt on dress nights - 'the name is really Andrew McQuarry,' he assured me, a distinct advantage on the Hebrides run - but because this job involves being a combination of hotel manager, cruise director, maitre d' and, well, yes, purser. I had my first peek behind the scenes the day before I went on duty. Andrew allowed me into the kitchen - sorry, galley - as he was preparing a picnic. This wasn't your usual basket of sandwiches and warm beer. The ship docked on Mull where a coach was ready to transport people along some of the most picturesque roads in the British Isles (once the guests were off, the ship was sailing for the next three hours, so that it would be ready to meet them on their return). Andrew and the staff, meanwhile, had a minibus ready to follow the coach with a four-course lunch, served in a local hall. The lunch had been prepared on the ship - so had the soaps, towels and toilet rolls . 'We can't risk the toilets not being up to our standard,' he explained. Not just that. The wine was at just the right temperature. Diets were taken care of. Wheat-free, non-dairy, gluten-free, kosher, vegetarian, diabetic. The biggest problem that the chief purser had that day was a request from one of the guests. 'Do you have a toothpick?' he was asked. Andrew said he was afraid that he didn't. My first public assignment was to help steer a couple of charming Americans who wanted to know about the route we were taking. I tried to blind them with the science of charts and suchlike, but since I get lost on the M25, I had to hope against hope that they wouldn't be too worried about confusing the Isle of Skye with the Isle of Muck, which is precisely where I would have been if they ever found out. Then there were the coach companies. On the first stop of the day we had to be sure they were ready to provide the vehicles that would be taking the people on their tours round the islands, down to the beautiful beaches, up the mountains and to places like a tweed mill on the Isle of Harris, a salmon smokery and on to the nearest castles. They weren't the coaches we needed for this cruise, you understand. Those had been booked long before. I was acting on behalf of the Hebridean Princess, and planning for next year; the same coaches and the same dray on Skye, the one drawn by two huge horses, which makes the short trip from the dock and up the road to a nearby garden. I was satisfied that all would be well in 2001. There was a staff meeting. Someone reported seeing soot at the foot of the funnel. 'Clean it,' I said. My executive decision of the day. Later, I was informed the soot had gone. The power of a chief purser is amazing. I hadn't noticed two stains on the carpet in one of the cabins - sorry, 'staterooms'. That was one reason why I wasn't a full-time chief purser. Once they were pointed out, I suggested the carpet be taken out and cleaned when we docked the following Thursday. Instantly agreed. I went on deck. No more soot. Then, inside again, I examined the flowers. They looked fine. There were no cigarette ends lying around. What more could I ask for? To make sure that the food stocks were holding up, for one thing. They were. That's critical on a ship where no one is served frozen food. The Princess line's head office at Skipton, Yorkshire, had to be given a rundown of what the guests on this cruise liked. They wouldn't be given red meat if we knew they ate only fish or poultry. Diabetics would be sure to have sugar-free desserts prepared for them. Vegetarians wouldn't be offered, let alone served, anything they could not eat. They would be sure to serve only sparkling mineral water to those whose file said they required it. I am sure that if still water were supplied it would be a sacking offence. And then there was The Highlander, a gentleman who, dressed in traditional gear, came aboard one night after dinner and told the story of the Jacobite Rebellion. The fate of which, as far as he is concerned, was the great tragedy of the Scottish nation. He had to be phoned and booked for next year. My broadcasting experience proved invaluable when we tied up close to the grave of Flora Macdonald, heroine of Bonnie Prince Charlie's escape from the marauding Redcoats. 'Happy day,' I called on the ship's microphone, 'now the fun begins.' I thought Andrew looked a little shocked. Maybe he thought that the red blazer I habitually wore when I wasn't in uniform revealed some hitherto hidden experience at Butlin's. I assured him it didn't - and my fellow guests told me they appreciated the friendliness of it all. I thought that would be more successful than organising the clay-pigeon shoot on board the afternoon we were at sea. That was when I was handed the loaded shotgun. My military background - National Service, Royal Army Service Corps - could not help. In those days there were more bulls in the field next to the range than on my score card. But I had to set an example. First shot: into the blue. Second: a little too close to a real seagull for my liking, to say nothing of that of the seagull. And then the third one, a shot that will forever be recorded in the annals not just of the Hebridean Princess, but of the peace-loving Freedland family. A shot, carefully aimed - and one clay pigeon shatters in mid air. What a triumph. What an example to the ship's company. That's the moment I earn my four stripes. Next year's cruises on the Hebridean Princess start on 3 March. They range from four to 14 nights (although most people choose to go for one week). \u0095 Prices for a seven-night cruise start from \u00a31,280 per person for a single cabin to \u00a37,955 per person. The four-night Taste of the Hebrides and the Hebridean Sampler tours start at \u00a3885 for a single cabin and \u00a31,765 per person for the Isle of Arran suite. The Hebridean Spirit sails from Leith to the Baltic on its inaugural cruise on 3 July 2001. Built in Italy in 1991 but refitted in the style of the Hebridean Princess, the Spirit will 'follow the warmth of the sun', covering the Baltic, Italy, Greece, the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Prices start at \u00a32,380 for a six-night On the Heels of the Longships cruise from Sandefjord to Poole. Hebridean Island Cruises 01756 704704, e-mail: reservations@hebridean.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>So the queen speaks estuary English. I can't honestly say that I'd noticed, but then, I wasn't around in her more clipped Celia Johnson days. But now you come to mention it, although she's not quite Jamie Oliver, there is a certain mellowing of her vowel sounds. Why should one be surprised? Standard pronunciation across the country has also changed.</p> <p>Furthermore, the age of deference is dead, so where once broadcasters, opinion-makers and other more vocal setters of the spoken word aped the accents of the court, now the remnants of the class \u00e9lite are sinking into the speech patterns of the people. Language is nothing if not a social tool; as society changes so must speech change with it.</p> <p>There are precedents or pertinent analogies. In the nineteenth century, before the coming of the railways, time was not regularised throughout the country, but rather each major town set its own time, determined each day by setting the town's clock-hands to 12 when the sun was at its highest.</p> <p>But obviously, once there were trains and, therefore, train timetables, there needed to be a consistent, standardised time throughout the land. We would surely find it curious to live now in a country divided into different time zones. Is the consternation voiced now at the erosion of our once-various accents any more logical?</p> <p>For it is patently the case that as the telegraph and the train set a standard for time, so television has set a standard for speech. Much as people may baulk at the influence of the metropolitan \u00e9lite (which, while it may not be a social \u00e9lite in the class sense, is certainly a geographical \u00e9lite), it isn't surprising that a form of London accent has prevailed. This is a small country and a far more centralised one than any other in Europe and certainly far more so than America.</p> <p>The type of estuary English that most broadcasters (certainly most broadcasters under 40) speak has become the vernacular of the age. It isn't a case of a widespread adoption of mockney, or symptomatic necessarily of what are taken to be the inverted snobbery and anxiously democratising principles of the age, but a reflection of the obvious powers of mass communication. In much the same way, many children's speech patterns now betray a certain transatlantic twang; after all, most of the linguistic influences they receive are through American television programmes.</p> <p>But what is so wrong with a democratising principle governing our speech habits? Why do we hold so nervously to our old, class-defining patterns and accents? Of course there are casualties, though I don't say this in a spirit of self-pity. When I was a child, my accent, for example, was Received Pronunciation; now I am given to understand it is posh.

      "bodyText": "So the queen speaks estuary English. I can't honestly say that I'd noticed, but then, I wasn't around in her more clipped Celia Johnson days. But now you come to mention it, although she's not quite Jamie Oliver, there is a certain mellowing of her vowel sounds. Why should one be surprised? Standard pronunciation across the country has also changed. Furthermore, the age of deference is dead, so where once broadcasters, opinion-makers and other more vocal setters of the spoken word aped the accents of the court, now the remnants of the class \u00e9lite are sinking into the speech patterns of the people. Language is nothing if not a social tool; as society changes so must speech change with it. There are precedents or pertinent analogies. In the nineteenth century, before the coming of the railways, time was not regularised throughout the country, but rather each major town set its own time, determined each day by setting the town's clock-hands to 12 when the sun was at its highest. But obviously, once there were trains and, therefore, train timetables, there needed to be a consistent, standardised time throughout the land. We would surely find it curious to live now in a country divided into different time zones. Is the consternation voiced now at the erosion of our once-various accents any more logical? For it is patently the case that as the telegraph and the train set a standard for time, so television has set a standard for speech. Much as people may baulk at the influence of the metropolitan \u00e9lite (which, while it may not be a social \u00e9lite in the class sense, is certainly a geographical \u00e9lite), it isn't surprising that a form of London accent has prevailed. This is a small country and a far more centralised one than any other in Europe and certainly far more so than America. The type of estuary English that most broadcasters (certainly most broadcasters under 40) speak has become the vernacular of the age. It isn't a case of a widespread adoption of mockney, or symptomatic necessarily of what are taken to be the inverted snobbery and anxiously democratising principles of the age, but a reflection of the obvious powers of mass communication. In much the same way, many children's speech patterns now betray a certain transatlantic twang; after all, most of the linguistic influences they receive are through American television programmes. But what is so wrong with a democratising principle governing our speech habits? Why do we hold so nervously to our old, class-defining patterns and accents? Of course there are casualties, though I don't say this in a spirit of self-pity. When I was a child, my accent, for example, was Received Pronunciation; now I am given to understand it is posh. I can live with that. To change one's accent consciously would be the act of a phoney and shifts in pronunciation are piecemeal rather than the product the sort of Meryl Streep-like virtuosity brought about by a dialogue coach. What it means simply is that what constitutes RP is different. Furthermore, if we feel that a standardised spoken language is against natural laws, we should also remember that the notion of standardised spelling is relatively recent. The age of mass literacy required a shared system of spelling, brought about by the power of the public prints, and we would find it as odd to return to an age that dispensed with this as we would to adopt the jumble of timescales that once unquestioningly pertained. But as with all change, the shift in speech patterns is hardly sudden. For all that the Australian linguists have only recently offered their apparently inflammatory breakdown of the monarchical tongue, it was many years ago that John Honey made just such claims in Does Accent Matter? (Faber 1989), a book that investigated the history, influence and susceptibilities of accent. Not only should Does Accent Matter? never have been allowed to go out of print, but it should be used as part of illuminating textual analysis in every school in the country. Among many other cases, John Honey recorded the shifts in the accent in which Princess Diana spoke in the first 10 years of her public reign, for want of a better word. It might sound vehemently anti-democratic to site (or cite) confirmation of language change by concentrating on the evolving accents of the royals, but it is pertinent, nevertheless.

      "body": "<p>Everybody loves a bargain and January is the month when many of us rush to the shops in search of that elusive must-have item at a fraction of its usual price. The 2001 sales are threatening to fall short of the last couple of years, according to the British Retail Consortium, due to lower stock levels and smaller discounts, but there should still be some good deals out there for dedicated bargain-hunters.</p> <p>The best are likely to be found at the clothing and footwear retailers. This is because their wares are bought in bulk and have a limited shelf life ruled by the vagaries of fashion and the seasons. Electrical outlets might also yield some real finds if, for example, a line of computers or TVs is being replaced, or the shop wants to get rid of old models gathering dust.</p> <p>BRC spokesman David Smith says: 'There has been a lot of overstocking in the past couple of years, with clothes in particular, which has led to pre-Christmas markdowns because the stock was just taking up space.' This year, he says, retailers have been exercising more caution in their stocking levels. </p> <p>However, overstocking is not the only factor that determines price cuts. If trading up to Christmas has been tough going, then shoppers are more likely to benefit from dramatic price cuts in the New Year. </p> <p>This year pre-Christmas trading has been 'subdued', according to one retail analyst. Consumer confidence has been dented by several factors, including interest rates and the slowdown in the housing market. And there is none of the feel-good factor generated by the millennium celebrations that buoyed the market last year.</p> <p>But if none of this puts you off, there are some golden rules to remember. Sale signs screaming '50 per cent off' are usually just headline-grabbing promotions designed to draw you into the shop and very few lines are likely to carry such big reductions.</p> <p>Another common trick among retailers is phasing in the depth of the price cuts throughout January. You may feel you have picked up a bargain but after a couple of weeks it may have another 10 per cent shaved off - if it is still there, of course. If you are not going to bother wading through the shops because you didn't fancy the look of anything before Christmas, bear in mind that there will be more than just markdowns. A lot of retailers bring in so-called 'special purchases' to put in the sale.</p> <p>Goods are often colour-coded to indicate the category they fall into - special purchase, markdown or shop-soiled - so look out for these.</p> <p>In Scotland, most sales will start this year on Tuesday, while in the rest of the country they get under way on Wednesday. One analyst says: 'Most clothing retailers are holding off the start of their sales because they do not want to get sucked into a tit-for-tat situation which arguably only benefits the consumer.' So what can you expect?</p> <p><strong>The High Street</strong></p> <p>Shoe shops Saxone and Barratts say they have not settled on when their sales will start; they prefer not to decide until the last minute because the factors that influence their decisions change all the time. But fellow shoe shop Faith has already started its sale.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencers' sale starts in five stores nationwide on Boxing Day and in other M&amp;S stores from the day after. </p> <p>The troubled high street giant is advertising price cuts on selected items across womenswear, menswear, lingerie and homeware using that magic phrase 'up to 50 per cent off'. Winter coats that would normally set you back \u00a3160 will be \u00a380 and there is a 'major clearance' of leather. Mohair jumpers will also be half price at \u00a314. </p> <p>M&amp;S's famous underwear department will have bras from \u00a312 and knickers from \u00a32, including what it promises are items from the more glamourous end of its range.</p> <p>Sportswear will be 40 per cent cheaper on average.

      "bodyText": "Everybody loves a bargain and January is the month when many of us rush to the shops in search of that elusive must-have item at a fraction of its usual price. The 2001 sales are threatening to fall short of the last couple of years, according to the British Retail Consortium, due to lower stock levels and smaller discounts, but there should still be some good deals out there for dedicated bargain-hunters. The best are likely to be found at the clothing and footwear retailers. This is because their wares are bought in bulk and have a limited shelf life ruled by the vagaries of fashion and the seasons. Electrical outlets might also yield some real finds if, for example, a line of computers or TVs is being replaced, or the shop wants to get rid of old models gathering dust. BRC spokesman David Smith says: 'There has been a lot of overstocking in the past couple of years, with clothes in particular, which has led to pre-Christmas markdowns because the stock was just taking up space.' This year, he says, retailers have been exercising more caution in their stocking levels. However, overstocking is not the only factor that determines price cuts. If trading up to Christmas has been tough going, then shoppers are more likely to benefit from dramatic price cuts in the New Year. This year pre-Christmas trading has been 'subdued', according to one retail analyst. Consumer confidence has been dented by several factors, including interest rates and the slowdown in the housing market. And there is none of the feel-good factor generated by the millennium celebrations that buoyed the market last year. But if none of this puts you off, there are some golden rules to remember. Sale signs screaming '50 per cent off' are usually just headline-grabbing promotions designed to draw you into the shop and very few lines are likely to carry such big reductions. Another common trick among retailers is phasing in the depth of the price cuts throughout January. You may feel you have picked up a bargain but after a couple of weeks it may have another 10 per cent shaved off - if it is still there, of course. If you are not going to bother wading through the shops because you didn't fancy the look of anything before Christmas, bear in mind that there will be more than just markdowns. A lot of retailers bring in so-called 'special purchases' to put in the sale. Goods are often colour-coded to indicate the category they fall into - special purchase, markdown or shop-soiled - so look out for these. In Scotland, most sales will start this year on Tuesday, while in the rest of the country they get under way on Wednesday. One analyst says: 'Most clothing retailers are holding off the start of their sales because they do not want to get sucked into a tit-for-tat situation which arguably only benefits the consumer.' So what can you expect? The High Street Shoe shops Saxone and Barratts say they have not settled on when their sales will start; they prefer not to decide until the last minute because the factors that influence their decisions change all the time. But fellow shoe shop Faith has already started its sale. Marks &amp; Spencers' sale starts in five stores nationwide on Boxing Day and in other M&amp;S stores from the day after. The troubled high street giant is advertising price cuts on selected items across womenswear, menswear, lingerie and homeware using that magic phrase 'up to 50 per cent off'. Winter coats that would normally set you back \u00a3160 will be \u00a380 and there is a 'major clearance' of leather. Mohair jumpers will also be half price at \u00a314. M&amp;S's famous underwear department will have bras from \u00a312 and knickers from \u00a32, including what it promises are items from the more glamourous end of its range. Sportswear will be 40 per cent cheaper on average. Men's shirts will be available from \u00a312 and ties from \u00a34. British Home Stores will be slashing the prices on some of its clothing and homeware items by between 50 and 75 per cent. Clothes which will cost just a quarter of their current retail prices include stretch jeans and a berry-coloured ladies' polyester suit. The sale starts at 9.30am on 27 December in London's Oxford Street and at 12pm on 26 December in Edinburgh. If you can brave the famous queue, the Harrods sale, which kicks off on 3 January, has 75 per cent off many of the ladies autumn/winter designer collections, including Ck from Calvin Klein and Betty Jackson. DKNY will be reduced by 40 per cent and Gucci by 50 per cent. For men, Paul Smith is down 40 per cent and Armani 50 per cent. There are also bargains to be had in the homeware department, such as 60 per cent off Harrods' own-brand porcelain dinnerware.

      "body": "<p>It's a veggie, Jim, but not as we know it. Scientists have successfully raised a crop of fresh greens on Martian soil, significantly boosting the possibility that there is, or at least could be, life on the Red Planet. </p> <p>The experiment has not taken place on Mars itself - where the temperature is rarely warmer than an inclement minus 60 C - but in a laboratory in New Zealand. Taking soil samples scraped from meteorites which fell to earth from the planet thousands of years ago, a team of researchers have grown tiny asparagus and potato plants. </p> <p>In comparison with soils from other planets, the samples show high levels of phosphates - necessary for growing good vegetables. The best results came from scrapings from a meteorite that landed in Australia in 1969 which soil fertility indicators showed had similar properties to the soil on earth. </p> <p>'If we build colonies in space we will have to grow plants for food, so obviously we need to know that the soil can support that. It shows that space-based soil could potentially support future human expansion in the solar system,' said Dr Michael Mautner, leader of the research team. </p> <p>It took Mautner and his colleagues only a few weeks to grow shoots several millimetres high. Previously whole crops have been raised on space stations. Cereals planted in space on orbiting units have even produced fertile seeds. Professor Colin Pillinger of the Open University said the new research confirms previous work with Martian soil. </p> <p>Pillinger himself has replicated the red planet's soil on earth and planted seeds in it. 'We grew some lovely vegetables; peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and so on. We exhibited them at Chelsea Flower show and won a gold medal,' he said. </p> <p>The Open University team's research has shown it is possible to extract water from Martian rocks. 'Everything is there for life except the life itself,' said Pillinger, who believes humans will live on Mars within 30 years. </p> <p>Scientists may eventually be able to plant some forms of life throughout the galaxy, seeding distant planets to test if they could support life. The New Zealand experiment has shown materials from interplanetary dust, meteorites and comets could have helped trigger life on earth. One theory is that organic compounds and whole cells could have been transported across galaxies by comets made of ice. If materials in the meteorites could grow potatoes then they could have provided the first micro-organisms with nutrients needed for survival. </p> <p>Britain's first landing on Mars, with a tiny robot explorer called 'Beagle Two' is scheduled for Boxing Day 2003. The 60kg unit will land on the surface of the planet and 'sniff' for organic chemicals associated with water and life and, presumably, little green men. </p> <p>Two weeks ago scientists at the American space agency Nasa said a four-year study of a Martian meteorite that was discovered in Antarctica in 1984 had concluded that it contained microscopic magnetic crystals that were identical to grains produced by bacteria on earth. </p> <p>The crystals are so similar that anyone studying the meteorite who did not know that it came from Mars would almost certainly conclude that it held evidence of life, the scientists who made the discovery said. </p> <p>The meteorite is about 4.5 billion years old and has lain in the Antarctic ice for 13,000 years. The vital crystals are so small that a billion of them would fit on the head of a pin.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's a veggie, Jim, but not as we know it. Scientists have successfully raised a crop of fresh greens on Martian soil, significantly boosting the possibility that there is, or at least could be, life on the Red Planet. The experiment has not taken place on Mars itself - where the temperature is rarely warmer than an inclement minus 60 C - but in a laboratory in New Zealand. Taking soil samples scraped from meteorites which fell to earth from the planet thousands of years ago, a team of researchers have grown tiny asparagus and potato plants. In comparison with soils from other planets, the samples show high levels of phosphates - necessary for growing good vegetables. The best results came from scrapings from a meteorite that landed in Australia in 1969 which soil fertility indicators showed had similar properties to the soil on earth. 'If we build colonies in space we will have to grow plants for food, so obviously we need to know that the soil can support that. It shows that space-based soil could potentially support future human expansion in the solar system,' said Dr Michael Mautner, leader of the research team. It took Mautner and his colleagues only a few weeks to grow shoots several millimetres high. Previously whole crops have been raised on space stations. Cereals planted in space on orbiting units have even produced fertile seeds. Professor Colin Pillinger of the Open University said the new research confirms previous work with Martian soil. Pillinger himself has replicated the red planet's soil on earth and planted seeds in it. 'We grew some lovely vegetables; peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and so on. We exhibited them at Chelsea Flower show and won a gold medal,' he said. The Open University team's research has shown it is possible to extract water from Martian rocks. 'Everything is there for life except the life itself,' said Pillinger, who believes humans will live on Mars within 30 years. Scientists may eventually be able to plant some forms of life throughout the galaxy, seeding distant planets to test if they could support life. The New Zealand experiment has shown materials from interplanetary dust, meteorites and comets could have helped trigger life on earth. One theory is that organic compounds and whole cells could have been transported across galaxies by comets made of ice. If materials in the meteorites could grow potatoes then they could have provided the first micro-organisms with nutrients needed for survival. Britain's first landing on Mars, with a tiny robot explorer called 'Beagle Two' is scheduled for Boxing Day 2003. The 60kg unit will land on the surface of the planet and 'sniff' for organic chemicals associated with water and life and, presumably, little green men. Two weeks ago scientists at the American space agency Nasa said a four-year study of a Martian meteorite that was discovered in Antarctica in 1984 had concluded that it contained microscopic magnetic crystals that were identical to grains produced by bacteria on earth. The crystals are so similar that anyone studying the meteorite who did not know that it came from Mars would almost certainly conclude that it held evidence of life, the scientists who made the discovery said. The meteorite is about 4.5 billion years old and has lain in the Antarctic ice for 13,000 years. The vital crystals are so small that a billion of them would fit on the head of a pin.",

      "body": "<p>It is worth pinpointing the heart and soul of a dish and striving to get it right. Otherwise you might as well not bother. After years of cooking the Sunday roast, I now realise that it is neither the meat, tracklements (the mustard, redcurrant jelly and mint sauces) nor vegetables that is the crucial part, but the accompanying gravy. It is this savoury juice that holds the whole thing together. It is the gravy that makes the meal work. </p> <p>The only gravy I want to know about is the one made with the pan drippings and meat juices of the roast it is to accompany. An 'integral' gravy whose heart and soul have come from the roast it is due to lubricate. To put it another way, I want my gravy to belong. </p> <p>I have no doubt that we should make an impromptu 'sauce' to go with our roast. The fact that meat carves more easily and stays more juicy when given 15 minutes' rest between oven and table is surely evidence enough that we are supposed to make gravy to go with it. Fifteen minutes to hang around, tantalised by a glistening roast? Someone is trying to tell us something. </p> <p>What doesn't quite get there is a sauce made without access to the caramelised juices and flavourings from the meat. A sauce whose heart is elsewhere. </p> <p>One of my gripes with some (I say some) classical French cooking is that the meat and its sauce don't meet till they get to the plate. Yes, that sauce may well be flavoured and given depth with the reduced goodness from previous roasts - known as glace de viande - but this is rather like giving a newborn baby someone else's parents. There is much goodness there, but it is not quite the same. </p> <p>Gravy is not a sauce. It is, or should be, a deeply savoury liquor made from the meat drippings and sediment that collects in the roasting tin. It may be let down with water, wine or stock to make it more palatable - not to mention making it go further - but the meat juices are its backbone. We introduce outside flavourings at our peril. </p> <p>Dark and intriguing it may be, but there is little mystery to making gravy. A perfectly decent one (I might argue the best) can be made by pouring boiling water into a pan after removing the roasted meat, then stirring to dissolve the sticky goo that has accumulated during roasting. Voil\u00e0! But you can tinker with it to great effect, too, adding some appropriate wine or fortified spirit, or introducing some herbs or perhaps a little spice. The soul of the juice will still be there - all you have done is to introduce a little bonus. </p> <p>Anything we add to a recipe should be appropriate, so with roast pork, for instance, we could add fennel seeds or maybe a squeeze of sharp Seville orange to the gravy. Either would flatter the meat. With lamb, you could add freshly chopped mint or some thyme. Neither would impose itself on the meat; they are natural partners. A mustard gravy for beef can be stunning, especially when you have a few spinach leaves to soften in its latent heat. It is simply a question of adding something that feels right, something that has an affinity and a history of working well with meat juices. </p> <p>A great favourite of mine is to leave a few whole and unskinned garlic cloves in with the meat. As their skins brown, their insides become sweet and mild and can be squashed as easily as butter into the pan juices. This is a fine one to serve with a leg or shoulder of lamb. I have done the same with tomatoes too, crushing their flesh and juice into the pan with the back of a wooden spoon. Good with chicken, that one. </p> <p>As a country, we can be divided into those who put flour in their gravy and those who don't. It is not a north/south divide, but I have detected a liking for thicker, possibly more sustaining gravies wherever I have lived in the north. That, for the record, means Ilkley, Yorkshire and the Lake District. My late stepmother, born and bred in the Midlands, was a flour and gravy-browning woman, her point being that the result should be as dark and thick as possible. Modern thinking is that flour is unnecessary and gravy browning a sin only just short of cannibalism. </p> <p>I cannot say I don't ever put a bit of flour in my sauces. I do think the mock-horror and raised eyebrows that inevitably follow the sprinkling of a spoonful of MacDougall's is nothing more than misplaced snobbery. Sometimes a thick gravy seems appropriate, say, when the weather is cold, and always with liver and onions or sausage and mash. It is not just a case of stirring in a spoonful of flour to thicken; the raw starch needs cooking, browning nuttily in the fat. </p> <p>You can faff about with arrowroot or cornflour if you wish, but I find gravy thickened in this manner often more gloopy than luscious. What we are after is, whether as clear as amber or as voluptuous as a velvet throw, not simply a savoury lubricant, but something that brings our meal together, be it Sunday beef or Christmas turkey. As I said, the heart of a dish. Its soul and, I think, its point. </p> <p><strong> A simple gravy from the roasting tin</strong></p> <p><strong>the roasting tin and its fat, debris and aromatics wine, stock or water </strong></p> <p>Lift the roast from the tin and set it aside to rest. If there is a thick layer of fat in the tin, then tip it off into a heatproof bowl and save it. You can use it to roast potatoes. Leave the thin layer of the dark juices that lie under the fat behind in the tin, then scoop out the bits of herbs, garlic and onion that may be in the pan and discard. </p> <p>Put the tin over a low to moderate heat and pour in enough liquid to make a thin layer in the bottom. The amount you add will depend on how rich you want your gravy to be and how much meat juice you have to work with. As the liquid comes to the boil, stir it with a balloon whisk or wooden spoon, scraping away at the debris and crusty bits stuck to the pan until they dissolve. </p> <p>Let the mixture bubble and reduce for a minute or two, then taste and add a little salt and some black pepper. It will not thicken, so take it off the heat once it has concentrated to a thin but aromatic liquor. </p> <p><strong> A thick gravy</strong></p> <p>This is the gravy I use when I want a rich, meaty sauce to eat with sausages or, especially, Yorkshire pudding.Remove the roast from the pan and set it to one side to rest. Now stir in 1 tbsp flour and place the pan over a moderate heat. Stir the flour into the juices left in the pan, and let it cook until it smells nutty. Take care that the flour does not burn. When you have a thin, biscuit-coloured paste, pour in a little stock or water and keep stirring until it thickens, adding more liquid as you go, thinning the gravy to the consistency you like. Let it bubble gently for a minute or two longer than you would for a thin gravy. </p> <p><strong> A mushroom and Madeira gravy </strong><br> </p> <p>A fine, richly flavoured gravy for roast birds, especially game birds and turkey. I have chosen to use a little flour to enrich this, as it is less temperamental than a sauce thickened with arrowroot and, I think, less detectable. Enough for a large chicken or medium-sized turkey. </p> <p><strong>the roasting pan, and its juices, sticky debris and aromatics </strong></p> <p><strong>500ml stock (preferably made from the giblets) </strong></p> <p><strong>100g small brown mushrooms, thinly sliced </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp plain flour </strong></p> <p><strong>about 100ml Madeira </strong></p> <p>Pour off most of the fat in the roasting tin, leaving behind 3 or 4 tbsp of caramelised meat juices, the herbs and vegetables. Place it over a low to moderate heat, add the mushrooms and cook until they have coloured and softened, stirring them occasionally. </p> <p>Sprinkle in 1 tbsp, no more, of flour and stir it in until the mushrooms are loosely bound together. Let the mixture cook for a few minutes, taking care it does not burn. You want the flour to cook so that there is no raw taste. Add a few tablespoons of the stock and stir until you have a thin paste, then continue adding the stock until you have a thinnish gravy. Bring towards the boil, adding salt and black pepper. Pour in the Madeira and continue cooking, at a low and leisurely bubble, for about 15 minutes. Pour the whole lot through a strainer, pushing hard with the back of a spoon to extract all the flavour from the mushrooms, into a small pan, bring back to the boil, check the seasoning and pour into a warmed gravy boat.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Not being a Christian, I have no religious sentiments about Christmas at all, but am glad to share in the general sense of goodwill and a fresh start. Christ or light (pace John 1: 4-9), certainly something is born anew.</p> <p>I always arrive at Christmas with the relief of a sailor turning the Cape. For the past few months I have been battling against heavy weather, sailing into the wind, managing the garden from crisis to crisis. One day is completed in order to survive the next. But then you round Christmas, the Cape of Enforced Cheer, and the wind is suddenly tucked into your back. The currents are sweeping me towards spring like a conveyor belt. Sure, the days are short, the weather vile and good intentions undergo their own private shipwrecks, but I have a palpable sensation of heading for home, however high the local seas. </p> <p>The light has a lot to do with it. Now that the solstice is past, the days are moving out, imperceptibly perhaps - but from now on the extra minutes at five o'clock matter as much as hours in midsummer. These are moments of light as precious as jewels. </p> <p>I always spend the period between Christmas and New Year taking stock in the garden and preparing for next year. If I look back over this year it initially seems to have been dominated by the weather, and I see that exactly a year ago we were flooded, the garden half under water, and my garden diary has the one highly horticultural comment: 'No baths, washing machines, etc' (the 'etc' meant flushing loos). </p> <p>Certainly my experience of this autumn has been just like everyone else's - sodden, although the summer was not too bad. It rained a bit and we had the odd chilly day but the sun also shone and the ground was, well, normal. By September the soil in the borders was really dry and even in October, when we were moving some apple trees in driving rain, an inch or two down it was bone dry. The important yardstick was that nothing in the garden was delayed or brought forward by the weather other than the slow creep of global warming that is nudging the seasons aside. So spring was in full flow by March. My diary entry for 4 March reads: 'Primroses in great mounds in coppice and violets extraordinary. Cowslips out - perhaps a dozen or more - weirdly early.' And autumn - despite the rain - was warm well into November, with all the tender plants we habitually grow, such as leonotis, tithonia, salvia and cosmos, blooming lustily yet. </p> <p>I feel strangely ungrateful for these seasonal extensions, as they seem to be an increase in quantity rather than quality. Seasons in the garden are created by a series of impressionistic strokes that build a picture up and this early spring and drawn-out autumn are a watercolour wash. Not bad, but not really better. </p> <p>Much of gardening 2000 was spent in front of a camera in someone else's garden, real and pretend. Real Gardens dominated my working life from March to September and has disappeared after three series. This is a real loss and I am certain Channel 4 has made a mistake. Real Gardens was a beautifully simple idea that really engaged with the day-to-day reality of people's lives via their gardens. It was sometimes uneven but at its best it reached parts that no other gardening programme has reached. Lost Gardens has another series going out in a month or so that we shot in the spring and is an enormously potent series to work on. Garden archaeology is fascinating and it still astonishes me how much evidence is left in the ground to uncover, from planting holes to hard landscaping. I know many people have a skewed vision of how television works - overestimating the veracity of half of it and simultaneously suspecting jiggery-pokery where none exists. But behind the scenes on Lost Gardens there is a real intensity of interest and involvement from everybody, from presenters to the people that do the computer graphics. </p> <p>For the third year running - and probably the last for the foreseeable future - I was very involved in televising the RHS flower shows at Chelsea, Hampton Court and Tatton Park. The latter is a fine day out and the combination of the beauty of Hampton Court Palace and its park and the sprawling ease of the show itself makes Hampton Court attractive, but Chelsea is a dog. It is terribly aware of its own importance but entirely devoid of charm. I always find things that I like there and I want it to go on existing, but visiting it is an unpleasant experience and spending eight days making 10 television programmes devoted entirely to it is exhausting and numbing. The combination of unctuous deference and anxious, competitive point-scoring is not attractive and stymies real creativity. For sure you will see fabulous plants but the show never adds up to the sum of its parts. The money spent on most of the show gardens is absurd and the good stuff is often overlooked or deliberately snubbed. But by far the worst aspect of Chelsea is the sense that no one - other than the great and the good - is actively welcome. You come away with the unavoidable impression that all visitors, exhibitors and members of the media are there just because the corporate money-making machine must be fed. </p> <p>Before anyone accuses me of paranoia, or of having a gratuitous go at the RHS, this is not the case at all at the Malvern, Hampton Court or Tatton Park shows - all run in a perfectly friendly, welcoming fashion by the RHS. It is a Chelsea thing and, having observed the show as closely as anyone over the past three years, I would say that nothing would improve it more than simply making it more enjoyable. </p> <p>I gave the prizes away at the Garden Industries annual jamboree last June and elicited boos and jeers by suggesting they wake up to the fact of the growing organic movement. The knee-jerk response was that organics is some kind of lefty plot to undermine the industry. But afterwards, quite a few manufacturers and suppliers came up to talk about organics in a sensible, serious way. Certain sections of the horticultural world (not least the RHS) view organics in the same breath as astrology or acupuncture - they acknowledge its popularity then dismiss it as 'not serious'. Well, this year has seen a huge increase in interest in organic gardening and I am sure that will go on developing. Certainly I will do all I can to help that process. </p> <p>And the best moment since last Christmas? No one thing of course - and a thousand half-moments. But flicking back through the garden diary I remember this particular entry on 9 June as both being suffused with pleasure and typical of the reason that I garden at all: 'Wrote Observer all day. Made bread. Little Gem v. good. Broad beans lovely 3in pods. Jewel garden brilliant but needs working on. Played cricket with Adam 7-8pm. Good fun. Sarah said coppice was \"what she dreamed of\" when we walked round together at 9pm. Lovely Prussian Blue sky at 11pm.' </p> <p>Happy Christmas.</p> <p><strong>Your roots: 'Tis the season to be pruning...</strong></p> <p>If the days between Christmas and New Year are mild and dry, use them to winter prune all fruit. </p> <p>\u0095 Autumn raspberries can be cut to the ground, pulling up any suckers that are spreading too far. Mulch thickly with compost.</p> <p>\u0095 Apple and pear trees need any crossing or rubbing branches removed and the centre of the tree sufficiently thinned to let a good flow of air run through it. Leave a good system of short, knobbly spurs growing off each branch - these will produce next spring's buds and fruit.</p> <p>\u0095 Gooseberries and redcurrants need their leaders cut back by about a third. Prune away all inward-growing growth so that the interior is clear - this will help ventilation and make it easier to deal with sawfly.</p> <p>\u0095 Blackcurrants should have been pruned late summer but you can do it now. Cut all the stems that bore fruit this year back to the ground. These will grow back to fruit in 18 months' time. The remaining shoots will fruit next summer.</p> <p>\u0095 Do not prune plums or greengages now; this should be done in the summer after fruiting (only cut out crossing branches or diseased growth).</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>I have just spent the day pruning the pleached limes and I can honestly say that now, at 4.45 on a Sunday evening, boots off, hands washed and cup of tea in hand, that I feel as good as I have done all winter. There was a shower when the logs were delivered yesterday morning - all in 6ft lengths that had to be sawn up and stacked to keep the Christmas fires burning - and I heard the rain lash the windows at 4am, but other than that it has been dry for two whole days. Sunshine, a wind keen enough to make the warmth of a jacket friendly and, above all, light. </p> <p>The pruning of the limes is probably my favourite winter job. I peck at it for weeks, occasionally getting a whole day or two but more often an hour or so here and there, depending on the weather and other commitments. Over the summer the limes sprout with enormous vigour and put on as much as 6ft of whippy growth from innumerable buds. Almost all are removed, going back to the barest of skeletons. You can see why Grinling Gibbons loved lime so. It cuts better than any other wood. It is soft enough to reward a sharp pair of secateurs or knife and yet firm enough to be crisp edged. A good pair of secateurs is enough to cut all but the largest shoots, but I have a little arsenal of secateurs, knife, medium and long loppers and a pruning saw, too, just in case. I also have a ball of tarred twine and a bundle of straight hazel rods to complete the kit. The latter are for replacing broken supports to which the lateral branches are tied to train them to make the grid. When a section is done it looks severe but as long as you accept that this kind of pruning is artificial, this is fine. It is just the pleaching taken back to the wintry essence of itself.</p> <p>I am having an ongoing battle of wills with our largest water butt. We inherited it and it is huge, but has been overflowing, the excess submerging the greenhouse and cold frames. So I put a hosepipe onto the stopcock and diverted it down to where the gunnera and hostas are - on the basis that they will relish any excess wet. But the stopcock is temperamental and fickle, varying from a flow to a dribble with seemingly no consistency whatsoever. Anything less than a steady flow will not keep pace with the rain and it still overflows. To use and store our rainwater more constructively would be one in the eye for all the rain we have had, and I think that this will be another project for next year.</p>",

Seasons in the garden are created by a series of impressionistic strokes that build a picture up and this early spring and drawn-out autumn are a watercolour wash. Not bad, but not really better. Much of gardening 2000 was spent in front of a camera in someone else's garden, real and pretend. Real Gardens dominated my working life from March to September and has disappeared after three series. This is a real loss and I am certain Channel 4 has made a mistake. Real Gardens was a beautifully simple idea that really engaged with the day-to-day reality of people's lives via their gardens. It was sometimes uneven but at its best it reached parts that no other gardening programme has reached. Lost Gardens has another series going out in a month or so that we shot in the spring and is an enormously potent series to work on. Garden archaeology is fascinating and it still astonishes me how much evidence is left in the ground to uncover, from planting holes to hard landscaping. I know many people have a skewed vision of how television works - overestimating the veracity of half of it and simultaneously suspecting jiggery-pokery where none exists. But behind the scenes on Lost Gardens there is a real intensity of interest and involvement from everybody, from presenters to the people that do the computer graphics. For the third year running - and probably the last for the foreseeable future - I was very involved in televising the RHS flower shows at Chelsea, Hampton Court and Tatton Park. The latter is a fine day out and the combination of the beauty of Hampton Court Palace and its park and the sprawling ease of the show itself makes Hampton Court attractive, but Chelsea is a dog. It is terribly aware of its own importance but entirely devoid of charm. I always find things that I like there and I want it to go on existing, but visiting it is an unpleasant experience and spending eight days making 10 television programmes devoted entirely to it is exhausting and numbing. The combination of unctuous deference and anxious, competitive point-scoring is not attractive and stymies real creativity. For sure you will see fabulous plants but the show never adds up to the sum of its parts. The money spent on most of the show gardens is absurd and the good stuff is often overlooked or deliberately snubbed. But by far the worst aspect of Chelsea is the sense that no one - other than the great and the good - is actively welcome. You come away with the unavoidable impression that all visitors, exhibitors and members of the media are there just because the corporate money-making machine must be fed. Before anyone accuses me of paranoia, or of having a gratuitous go at the RHS, this is not the case at all at the Malvern, Hampton Court or Tatton Park shows - all run in a perfectly friendly, welcoming fashion by the RHS. It is a Chelsea thing and, having observed the show as closely as anyone over the past three years, I would say that nothing would improve it more than simply making it more enjoyable. I gave the prizes away at the Garden Industries annual jamboree last June and elicited boos and jeers by suggesting they wake up to the fact of the growing organic movement. The knee-jerk response was that organics is some kind of lefty plot to undermine the industry. But afterwards, quite a few manufacturers and suppliers came up to talk about organics in a sensible, serious way. Certain sections of the horticultural world (not least the RHS) view organics in the same breath as astrology or acupuncture - they acknowledge its popularity then dismiss it as 'not serious'. Well, this year has seen a huge increase in interest in organic gardening and I am sure that will go on developing. Certainly I will do all I can to help that process. And the best moment since last Christmas? No one thing of course - and a thousand half-moments. But flicking back through the garden diary I remember this particular entry on 9 June as both being suffused with pleasure and typical of the reason that I garden at all: 'Wrote Observer all day. Made bread. Little Gem v. good. Broad beans lovely 3in pods. Jewel garden brilliant but needs working on. Played cricket with Adam 7-8pm. Good fun. Sarah said coppice was \"what she dreamed of\" when we walked round together at 9pm. Lovely Prussian Blue sky at 11pm.' Happy Christmas. Your roots: 'Tis the season to be pruning... If the days between Christmas and New Year are mild and dry, use them to winter prune all fruit. \u0095 Autumn raspberries can be cut to the ground, pulling up any suckers that are spreading too far. Mulch thickly with compost. \u0095 Apple and pear trees need any crossing or rubbing branches removed and the centre of the tree sufficiently thinned to let a good flow of air run through it. Leave a good system of short, knobbly spurs growing off each branch - these will produce next spring's buds and fruit. \u0095 Gooseberries and redcurrants need their leaders cut back by about a third. Prune away all inward-growing growth so that the interior is clear - this will help ventilation and make it easier to deal with sawfly. \u0095 Blackcurrants should have been pruned late summer but you can do it now. Cut all the stems that bore fruit this year back to the ground. These will grow back to fruit in 18 months' time. The remaining shoots will fruit next summer. \u0095 Do not prune plums or greengages now; this should be done in the summer after fruiting (only cut out crossing branches or diseased growth). My roots: A week in Monty's garden I have just spent the day pruning the pleached limes and I can honestly say that now, at 4.45 on a Sunday evening, boots off, hands washed and cup of tea in hand, that I feel as good as I have done all winter. There was a shower when the logs were delivered yesterday morning - all in 6ft lengths that had to be sawn up and stacked to keep the Christmas fires burning - and I heard the rain lash the windows at 4am, but other than that it has been dry for two whole days. Sunshine, a wind keen enough to make the warmth of a jacket friendly and, above all, light. The pruning of the limes is probably my favourite winter job. I peck at it for weeks, occasionally getting a whole day or two but more often an hour or so here and there, depending on the weather and other commitments. Over the summer the limes sprout with enormous vigour and put on as much as 6ft of whippy growth from innumerable buds. Almost all are removed, going back to the barest of skeletons. You can see why Grinling Gibbons loved lime so. It cuts better than any other wood. It is soft enough to reward a sharp pair of secateurs or knife and yet firm enough to be crisp edged. A good pair of secateurs is enough to cut all but the largest shoots, but I have a little arsenal of secateurs, knife, medium and long loppers and a pruning saw, too, just in case. I also have a ball of tarred twine and a bundle of straight hazel rods to complete the kit. The latter are for replacing broken supports to which the lateral branches are tied to train them to make the grid. When a section is done it looks severe but as long as you accept that this kind of pruning is artificial, this is fine. It is just the pleaching taken back to the wintry essence of itself. I am having an ongoing battle of wills with our largest water butt. We inherited it and it is huge, but has been overflowing, the excess submerging the greenhouse and cold frames. So I put a hosepipe onto the stopcock and diverted it down to where the gunnera and hostas are - on the basis that they will relish any excess wet. But the stopcock is temperamental and fickle, varying from a flow to a dribble with seemingly no consistency whatsoever. Anything less than a steady flow will not keep pace with the rain and it still overflows. To use and store our rainwater more constructively would be one in the eye for all the rain we have had, and I think that this will be another project for next year.",

The presence of women is seen as a significant advantage in the peace-keeping and aid operations that now comprise a high proportion of Britain's overseas deployments. Women already serve in artillery regiments and have been trained as helicopter and jet pilots. </p> <p>The next phase of the 'The Combat Effectiveness and Gender Study' is a survey of opinion among serving soldiers and their families. Thousands of questionnaires are being circulated to gauge feelings about the issue. </p> <p>The results, and those of the physical trials, will be combined with other research from foreign armed forces on the issue and sent to generals for their opinion.

'It would be immensely destabilising and possibly demoralising. And my wife would go completely mad.' </p> <p>Others challenge the physical capability of women soldiers. During the rescue of kidnapped British soldiers in Sierra Leone recently, soldiers jumped out of their helicopters and into a shoulder-deep swamp. 'All our lads were big guys,' another infantry officer said. 'There's no point in having a 5ft 2in woman in a 5ft 3in swamp.' </p> <p>There is also scepticism about the trials themselves. Soldiers say that judging troops on exercise says little about their potential performance in actual combat. 'It's camping with fireworks,' the officer said. 'It's got sod all to do with fighting.' </p> <p>Giving women combat roles would bring Britain into line with the armies of the US, Canada, Holland and Norway. It is likely, though, that the British forces, with the backing of Ministers, will use stringent testing of any potential recruits to combat units to limit the effect of the change.</p>",

The trials were the second stage of an MoD study that is considered so sensitive that only a few senior officers and the specialists involved in it are aware of the results. 'They are so worried about it they have kept it hermetically sealed,' said one military source. But The Observer has learnt that in the physical trials stage of the study, which is now complete, the two sexes interacted well in almost all situations, even in close environments such as tanks and bunkers and under heavy fire. The presence of women is seen as a significant advantage in the peace-keeping and aid operations that now comprise a high proportion of Britain's overseas deployments. Women already serve in artillery regiments and have been trained as helicopter and jet pilots. The next phase of the 'The Combat Effectiveness and Gender Study' is a survey of opinion among serving soldiers and their families. Thousands of questionnaires are being circulated to gauge feelings about the issue. The results, and those of the physical trials, will be combined with other research from foreign armed forces on the issue and sent to generals for their opinion. Senior officers may be able to use the findings from the survey to block any change. Trials for women on submarines resulted in the ban being maintained. The completed report will be given to a key committee chaired by Hoon for a final decision. The army is almost unanimously against any further change. 'There is no way that I would want anything other than a single-sex combat command,' said one senior officer, a former commander of an elite infantry regiment. 'It would be immensely destabilising and possibly demoralising. And my wife would go completely mad.' Others challenge the physical capability of women soldiers. During the rescue of kidnapped British soldiers in Sierra Leone recently, soldiers jumped out of their helicopters and into a shoulder-deep swamp. 'All our lads were big guys,' another infantry officer said. 'There's no point in having a 5ft 2in woman in a 5ft 3in swamp.' There is also scepticism about the trials themselves. Soldiers say that judging troops on exercise says little about their potential performance in actual combat. 'It's camping with fireworks,' the officer said. 'It's got sod all to do with fighting.' Giving women combat roles would bring Britain into line with the armies of the US, Canada, Holland and Norway. It is likely, though, that the British forces, with the backing of Ministers, will use stringent testing of any potential recruits to combat units to limit the effect of the change.",

The Rt Rev George Carey said the situation was constantly evolving, and argued that whether or not the Church of England maintained its special relationship with the Crown, it could still serve the nation.

Cardinal Winning, head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, has called the Act the 'grubby little secret' of the constitution. And Paddy Ashdown revealed in his diaries that Prince Charles had told him he saw no reason why Catholics should not sit on the throne. The Act dates back to 1701, when fear of the influence of Rome was so great that the nation decreed only Protestant heirs of Princess Sophia, grand-daughter of James 1, could take the throne. The Act also decrees that any Royal who marries a Catholic must renounce their rights to the succession. Meanwhile the head of the Anglican Church in Wales has signalled his impatience with establishment, arguing it gave the Church of England an inflated sense of its own importance. He also warned in an interview with the Daily Telegraph against a culture of instant gratification which he said could fuel marital problems over Christmas.

They prefer not to confront abuses but let them wither away.' Only in the unlikely event of the Prince of Wales wanting to marry a Roman Catholic would the reform of the Acts of Settlement have to be confronted. 'Then, but only then, they might very well change the law,' says Holloway. </p> <p>Bishop Holloway, who gave an interview to The Observer last week, says anyone appointed a bishop in the Church of England soon becomes a believer in establishment, even if they are not one already. But Holloway says he can take a more impartial view 'from the sidelines'. The Scottish Episcopal Church is in the Anglican communion but its head, the primus, is elected and is 'first among equals'. </p> <p>Unfairly, says Holloway with sudden asperity, it is often called the 'Laird's Church'. It was outlawed after it backed the Jacobites in the 1745 rebellion and for a time survived underground in Scotland. During the days of the penal laws, Episcopalians from down south were allowed to open 'qualified chapels', which became 'embassy churches' for Englishmen living north of the border. </p> <p>The irony was that, as a consequence, when the penal laws were lifted in 1792, the outlawed Scottish Episcopalians were inevitably thought of as 'the English Church' and the label has stuck. It also became associated with the Scottish lairds who were busy Anglicising themselves in the nineteenth century, but in the cities it continued to be a church of the poor. </p> <p>Holloway grew up in the Vale of Leven, a cradle of the industrial revolution, where his father was employed in a dye works. His career has taken him to Edinburgh via the United States, where he met his wife, and the Gorbals, where he suffered a crisis of faith. </p> <p>He has not abandoned his scepticism, believing faith and doubt are two sides of the same human coin, but has adapted to it by interpreting scripture not as historical fact but as message and metaphor - what he has described as theological code. He respects those who believe literally in the Bible - in the historical truth of the Garden of Eden or that Christ walked on water - but calls himself a 'secular Christian'. </p> <p>Above all he is inclusive; his chief dislike is dogmatic fundamentalism. He recalls that a former Archbishop of Singapore once accused him of hastening homosexuals to hell by denying they were living in sin. He bristles at the memory and says: 'Tolerance has it limits.' </p> <p>Holloway was a member of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority from 1991 to 1997. He takes a balanced approach to questions that have pitted some churchmen against science. He welcomed last week's debate on embryo cloning for therapeutic purposes. He said: 'The really interesting thing about most ethical debates is that they rarely raise questions of an obvious right versus an obvious wrong, but rather of competing goods. Good value systems can be in disagreement with each other.' He is in favour of the Abortion Act, which, he recalls, David Steel introduced for 'highly ethical reasons'. </p> <p>Though he respects the Roman Catholic moral tradition, he does not agree with its view that an embryo is a human being from the moment of reproductive fusion. He supports early-term abortion, because it is preferable to the alternative - women being driven into the hands of back-street abortionists and risking their lives in the process. </p> <p>He takes a similar view of drugs, believing the policy of interdiction to be a disaster, particularly in the US. 'I am in favour of the full legalisation of cannabis. I believe it should be available over the counter,' he says. </p> <p>On hard drugs he is more cautious. 'The treatment of heroin and other hard-drug addiction should be a matter for the health service. Prescribing heroin to addicts would break the link with the crime it drives them to commit and take the problem out of the underworld of the schemes and the ghettos.' </p> <p>Holloway is a member of the Labour Party but admits to a certain disillusion with New Labour, particularly its pandering to a tabloid agenda. Perhaps, he says hopefully, Labour 'will acquire more political courage in a second term'. </p> <p>As for the row over William Hague's comments on law and order, he acquits the Tory leader of racism while convicting him of 'a kind of political opportunism that is damaging to the public good'. But, he adds, there is an implicit racism in much of what is said on law and order by both the main parties and he regrets the arm-wrestling between Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe. </p> <p>But the question of police numbers is, in any case, of dubious relevance. He explains: 'We need to look at the causes of crime, which is what Tony Blair used to say. Crime is overwhelmingly associated with alienated and rootless young men and with poverty. Poverty remains a curse in our society, which must be addressed through policies of redistribution, perhaps in radical and imaginative ways.' </p> <p>He believes the Scottish Parliament can help. 'I'm a fan,' he says. He thinks Scotland has acquired much more self-confidence; indeed, Scots feel 'compassionate' about the English, who suddenly are confused and threatened about their own identity. </p> <p>For the time being at any rate, the devolution settlement has defused Scotland's discontents.

      "body": "<p>'It starts with the little things,' says James Cramer, founder of a website called <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com\" target=\"_new\">TheStreet.com</a> - as in Wall Street. 'Fifth Avenue merchants notice the crocodile handbags aren't moving as fast as anticipated. For-sale signs are sprouting up on lawns in unusual numbers.</p> <p>'Those are the first signs, not massive lay-offs.'</p> <p>However, end-of-year-accounts by America's biggest companies show some of those too: 15,000 at General Motors; 2,800 apiece at Gillette and Motorola. Along with the first snow of winter comes the chill of a colder wind: maybe not recession, but a few other 'r' words like retrenchment, or at least a reduction in growth sufficient to worry the fortune-tellers at the US central bank, the Federal Reserve.</p> <p>The latest findings of the Consumer Research Centre at the University of Michigan show that consumer confidence plunged in December, particularly among the affluent.</p> <p>The confidence index fell to 98.4 this month from 107.6 in November, the fourth-largest drop for a single month since it went monthly in 1978. The three larger drops came before the 1980 and 1990 recessions.</p> <p>The negative feelings are being spread by word of mouth. But there are positive signs too. The US Commerce Department said that personal income is holding up. So too is consumption - spending on services rose, although spending on merchandise fell.</p> <p>In Washington, the 'r' word has become a political hot potato. President-elect George W. Bush issues dire warnings about the apparently buoyant economy that he inherits; President Clinton, in turn, says he can see no recession on the horizon.</p> <p>Bush is making excuses in advance for the economic downturn that may haunt his presidency, and has political motives for his pessimism. He needs to blame whatever is around the corner on the Clinton administration.

      "bodyText": "'It starts with the little things,' says James Cramer, founder of a website called TheStreet.com - as in Wall Street. 'Fifth Avenue merchants notice the crocodile handbags aren't moving as fast as anticipated. For-sale signs are sprouting up on lawns in unusual numbers. 'Those are the first signs, not massive lay-offs.' However, end-of-year-accounts by America's biggest companies show some of those too: 15,000 at General Motors; 2,800 apiece at Gillette and Motorola. Along with the first snow of winter comes the chill of a colder wind: maybe not recession, but a few other 'r' words like retrenchment, or at least a reduction in growth sufficient to worry the fortune-tellers at the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. The latest findings of the Consumer Research Centre at the University of Michigan show that consumer confidence plunged in December, particularly among the affluent. The confidence index fell to 98.4 this month from 107.6 in November, the fourth-largest drop for a single month since it went monthly in 1978. The three larger drops came before the 1980 and 1990 recessions. The negative feelings are being spread by word of mouth. But there are positive signs too. The US Commerce Department said that personal income is holding up. So too is consumption - spending on services rose, although spending on merchandise fell. In Washington, the 'r' word has become a political hot potato. President-elect George W. Bush issues dire warnings about the apparently buoyant economy that he inherits; President Clinton, in turn, says he can see no recession on the horizon. Bush is making excuses in advance for the economic downturn that may haunt his presidency, and has political motives for his pessimism. He needs to blame whatever is around the corner on the Clinton administration. And he also regards an upcoming recession as a reason to push his controversial tax cut of $1.3 trillion (of which 43 per cent goes to the top 3 per cent of earners) through a divided and sceptical Congress. Gene Sperling, Clinton's senior economic adviser, lashed back at Bush, accusing the President-elect and his team of 'treating the economy as just another political football' in a way which will 'send the wrong signal to the markets about the seriousness with which they take their economic stewardship'. The tax-cut plan puts the administration immediately at loggerheads with Clinton's faith in the Federal Reserve as regulator of the economy. Officials at the Fed, meanwhile, told The Observer they are concerned that Bush's Cabinet appointments lack the experience, skills and connections to the financial markets needed to manage the Clinton bequest. And there is a tinderbox of potential flashpoints between Bush and the Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who has enjoyed a warm relationship with Clinton during the years of prosperity. Federal Reserve officials say the business cycle is turning towards a point at which sections of the economy are flush with over-investment, and subsequent profits, that cannot be maintained. 'The drag on demand and profits,' said the Fed last week, is exacerbated by 'rising energy costs as well as eroding consumer confidence, substantial shortfalls in sales and earnings and stress in segments of the financial markets' which 'suggest that economic growth may be slowing further'. The Christmas shopping throng in Midtown Manhattan is gridlock as usual. But sales are either down or below targets in the meanest Yuletide since the start of the boom with which America has led the global economic bonanza. Spokesmen for Macy's and Bloomingdale's are in 'wait and see' mode. Sherry Martins, junior manager at Saks, calls it 'the slowest holidays I can remember'. The shops are pitching their hopes on this week and the fact that a Monday Christmas will give people an extra weekend to flex their plastic. But the International Council of Shopping Centres reports that sales were down on last year by 12 per cent for the third week in December. WalMart is a fair measure of how the American public spends money, and this year the world's biggest chain of shops was predicting an increase in sales of between 3 and 5 per cent for November, December and January - after a rise of 6.3 per cent last year. So far, the increase is below 3 per cent. RCT Systems, which monitors traffic arriving and leaving shopping malls, reports movement to be down on last year by 9.6 per cent in malls and 14.4 per cent in department stores for the third week of the shopping season. 'Everything that could go bad is going bad,' says Daniel Barry, vice-president and senior retailing analyst for Merrill Lynch, who forecasts the worst Christmas since 1990. At Balthazar's in downtown Manhattan, a Christmas lunch for brokers and dealers from the ING investment bank features Chandon champagne from California. It tastes fine, but it's 'definitely not the French stuff,' complains Jennifer Riley, taking a swig. This is on the day that the Nasdaq, fearless barometer of the new economy, ended a two-month wild ride and closed at its lowest level since March 1999. 'There's almost no limit to how far these stocks can go down,' says James Raphalian at the S.G. Cowen investment firm. Few foresaw problems for the apparently ever-expanding dotcom beanfeast, where even the old standbys are now unsafe - Microsoft is down 62 per cent this year, facing its first 'flat quarter' for earnings. Last week, Bush did little to allay even his own fears. And there were doubts whether his new Treasury Secretary is up to the job of facing down a recession. Although he is close to Greenspan, Paul O'Neill, former head of Alcoa, the aluminium giant, does not have the links to the financial markets of his predecessors. And between Bush and Greenspan there is bound to be tension. Greenspan strongly favours using budget surpluses to reduce the national debt - in sharp contrast to Bush's preferred tax cut. With the economy softening, the Bush administration - like that of his father - will be tempted to prod Greenspan to lower interest rates quickly, a situation which soured relations between Greenspan and Bush senior, and a move the Fed refused to make last week in a clear signal to Bush junior. Whatever happened to the economic miracle? Five questions on the US slowdown: Recession? Where did that come from? If one thing is likely to spark recession, it is politicians talking about it. A nightmare scenario could see consumers cutting back spending, so banks will tighten lending conditions, for fear of bad loans. Businesses will then delay investments and lay off workers, meaning that fewer consumers spend money, and so begins a vicious circle. There is evidence of all of these elements, as well as a marked reduction in the US rate of growth between June and August. What happened to the rampaging internet-fuelled US miracle? Since the dotcom share crash in April, the idea that the internet and technology has somehow rewritten the rules of business and economics has been quietly forgotten. The growth rate fell back to 2.2 per cent in November and a host of profit warnings from blue chip technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Intel indicated that demand for computers was not endless, and that businesses were cutting back on other IT investment. The sharp rise in oil prices further jolted markets in autumn, but they have since pulled back. Has Alan Greenspan lost his touch? A 'hard landing' or recession was always a threat as the US economy soared ever higher during the Clinton years.

It should stand for continuity, for the comforts of indoors, for the deep pleasures of communication both with those who are present and with the absent. Imagination and sympathy should go into the giving of presents, the cooking of meals, the entering into other people's memories and aspirations. </p> <p>Even to articulate these banalities is to recognise how dismally far they are from being realised. Looking back, on the very brink of Christmas, it seems to me to have been a bad year; not just because of the collapse of the railways, the floods, the fiasco of the Dome or the demise of Vauxhall at Luton, but because we seem to have sunk into a state of communal despair. The people we rely on, policemen, nurses, teachers, are leaving their professions, new recruits are not coming forward, and there seems no way that civilised society can support itself. And thinking about children, who should be at the centre of Christmas, our despair is absolute. </p> <p>What has happened? The dramatic horror of Damilola Taylor's death did not seem like a single unrepeatable shaming event, but like a manifestation of an existing, barely hidden corruption, a proof that children can become inhuman, inaccessible, totally beyond control or communication. </p> <p>At a recent conference of teachers in London, on the subject of bullying, David Blunkett spoke about the Government's determination to crack down on the worst offenders, schools having new powers to exclude those who were persistently violent, and to punish severely all those who persecute other children, even short of stabbing them. Unfortunately, as is usual when Ministers take the time to come and speak on such occasions, neither he nor his civil servants had time to stay to hear the next speaker, nor the reaction of teachers to the Government's tough line. </p> <p>If he had stayed, he would soon have learned that the teachers thought him utterly wrong to advance a policy which, in their view, could not possibly do anything but harm. He would have heard, too, about the different approach to bullies, practised in a school in Leeds, but gradually spreading elsewhere, by which other pupils in the school are taught how to talk to the bullies, to get them to talk and to explain and express their feelings. And thus the bullies start on the long, slow, painful road, which leads to the recognition that their victims are also human, as they are themselves. For it is of the essence of human beings that they have feelings and can suffer. The typical bully is not only careless of the feelings of others, but only with difficulty acknowledges feeling in himself. He is desensitised. </p> <p>The bully lacks, but urgently needs, a moral sense. At the very heart of morality is the notion that one's self cannot be given priority over other people; that what I want is no more important, has no higher value, than what other people want. </p> <p>To understand this involves understanding that all human beings are in the same, precarious boat; that we are social animals, who, necessarily, live in society and depend on the good behaviour of others; and that therefore it is essential, if society is to survive, to want to be good rather than bad, to make things better rather than worse. Moral sense is therefore compounded of sympathy with other humans and a desire to be good. Children are capable of developing such a sense but they need to be taught to cultivate it. </p> <p>It is the acceptance of this fact - that children need to be taught - which lies behind the Government's insistence that there should be lessons in citizenship. However what we so far know of the proposed syllabus for these lessons seems incoherent and superficial. Information about the workings of Parliament and Local Government, about what are a citizen's rights and legal entitlements, appears to be mixed with virtuous injunctions about what constitutes good behaviour. </p> <p>Taught in a class of bored teenagers, this will have no effect on behaviour, even if it may, improbably, catch the interest of a few intellectuals. Teaching children to develop and cultivate a moral sense needs to be taught to children when they are very young, and not as a separate classroom subject. </p> <p>There seems to me no doubt that the teaching of a child to become a moral being, possessed of moral sensibility, must start young, and be carried out through endless conversation. The aim of this will be to open his eyes to the equal worth of other people; to open his sensibilities, perhaps through the telling of stories or the enacting of drama, to the feelings which he and others are capable of; to make him see that there is a sense in which, being human like the rest, he must try to make things better, to do good rather than harm. </p> <p>All these lessons must start early; and I have no doubt that the Jesuits were right in thinking that they need to get their hands on a child before he was seven.

Morality is not only the force which can inhibit bullies from tormenting their victims, but it is the framework of the law itself, upon which society depends. </p> <p>In order to bring about a will to inculcate in children an explicit devotion to the idea of being good rather than bad, there needs to be a cultural revolution, and it is the difficulty of bringing this about that lies behind our current despair. How can society change so as to embrace the concept of morality? </p> <p>One thing is certainly needed and that is the courage, among all who have to do with children, to be prepared to use a moral vocabulary, to talk, that is, about what is right or wrong, courageous or cowardly, cruel or kind. There are many reasons why this vocabulary is so difficult, or perhaps embarrassing, to adopt at the present time. </p> <p>One of the difficulties is the widespread fear of being 'judgmental', or seeming illegitimately to occupy the 'high moral ground'. But this is precisely the ground we must adopt (and by 'we' I mean all members of society who have any connection with children). We need to adopt this ground if we are to block the dissent into fear and moral chaos which faces us this year, which has being building up over many years, but which has never faced us so starkly. </p> <p>We need most urgently to teach children to understand to feel in their gut (or their conscience) what it is to do wrong. Above all, we need to teach them that, being human, we are all subject to temptation; we may all be tempted to cruelty, to a denial of human feeling, or to proving our power over the weak. But also, being human, we can overcome this temptation; wrongdoing is not inevitable. </p> <p>This lesson will not be taught through threats or aggressions or savage punishment. It can be taught, sadly, only by conversation and example, far more difficult, time consuming and laborious.

We must not be so much intimidated by the children in society, for whom we are responsible, that we refuse to contemplate talking to them. Former Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge, and a prolific scholar of moral philosophy, Baroness Warnock of Weeke's most recent work is An Intelligent Person's Guide to Ethics.

Eleven per cent of Britain's headteachers admit they are inspired by the example of Professor Albus Dumbledore, the fictional wizard in charge of Hogwarts School. The bearded professor is the creation of millionaire author J.K. Rowling. Earlier this year her series of Potter books were banned by the head of a primary school for making witchcraft look 'like fun', but a nationwide survey of headteachers released this weekend has discovered that the magical scholar is now almost as popular with the adults inside our classrooms as he is with the children. While the enduring appeal of James Hilton's earnest hero, Charles Chipping, still placed 'Chips' high up in the results, the more relaxed attitude of Dumbledore scores almost as well. The survey, which marks the launch of a website for schools set up by The Stationary Office, was designed to find out about attitudes and morale levels in primary and secondary schools. The fictional character named by most headteachers was Ian George, the beleaguered head played by Lenny Henry in the BBC's drama series, Hope and Glory. An overwhelming 62 per cent of respondents picked George. The answers received from headteachers generally indicated a shift towards more positive and avuncular values and away from the efficient business ethos of the 'superhead'. 'Dumbledore is popular because he is always there when required, but he does not interfere unnecessarily,' said Mike Forster, the former head of a comprehensive school in Worthing. 'He leaves Harry alone to do things and he allows him to make his own mistakes.' Headteachers reject, it seems, the verdict of the head of Chatham's St Mary's Island School, Carol Rookwood, who banned the younger children in her school from reading the Potter books. 'All headteachers these days need to make the most of scarce resources,' said Forster. 'Perhaps Albus Dumbledore's ability to create school banquets out of thin air is what appeals.' The professor is extremely popular from the pupil's perspective too. 'He understands the children and treats them fairly,' said Harry Potter fan, Anna, aged 12. 'He is in control of everybody, but not really strict and he is always making sure everything is all right.' Her friend Megan, also 12, agreed.

Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, made no comment to reporters when they voted at around 8.30am in a polling station in Belgrade's exclusive Dedinje suburb, where they live. Like other voters in what many observers say will be Serbia's first truly free and fair vote, Milosevic had a finger sprayed with an invisible security spray designed to prevent people from voting twice. The authorities appeared to have overcome a popular suspicion that it causes male impotence. Around the same time, at a primary school in New Belgrade, a wasteland of high-rise housing on the outskirts of the capital, a weeping woman greeted a new era. Olga Gavanski Palfi, 62, said between sobs: 'We have to decide if we will finally live like human beings. We have to clean our nation of the trash that made our history and future filthy.' She said both her brothers had fled to Canada under Milosevic and now she is at home alone with two children. 'I hope these elections mean we will never have to send our children to their deaths again - and they will never again have to flee the country.' The school is one of 8,700 polling stations in the election, which was set to give the anti-Milosevic coalition a massive mandate for change. Opinion polls show the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition gaining at least 60 per cent of the vote, which ought to translate into control of more than three-quarters of the Serbian parliament. Milosevic's Socialist Party has plummeted in the polls since the October revolution and September presidential and federal elections that ousted him from power. Socialist Party support has dropped from around 30 per cent to 13 per cent. But there remain some who still respect Milosevic.

I didn't vote for his party, but frankly I think even today we don't have a better leader.' A low-key DOS campaign has portrayed the elections as the chance to end the Milosevic era. Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party, has been named Serbian Prime Minister-designate and has named most of his Cabinet. Most people believe the new government will improve living conditions and create new opportunities. They also want corrupt politicians and officials to be made answerable: 'I expect the economic situation to be better and I want arrests from the top to the bottom for all those responsible for the situation we are in now,' said clerk Dejan Milinkovic.

In the divided town of Mitrovica observers from the Belgrade-based election monitors' organisation, CESID, said the number of voters had barely reached 10 per cent by midday. September's polls saw several voting stations report support at more than 90 per cent for Milosevic's party, claims rebutted by opposition supporters. Yesterday the extent of fraud in previous elections could be seen in Albanian enclaves in the north of Kosovo. One polling station that covers six Albanian villages had not registered a single vote after three hours of polling. Previously, the area's 2,407 voters had nearly all voted for Milosevic. 'Maybe they were depressed Milosevic is no longer a candidate!' said DOS member Nikola Kabosic. The UN, which organised 'witnesses' to count the number of voters going into polling stations during the last ballot, said it has had no reason to fear attempts to falsify the result this time. Officials from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe were sent to observe the polls in the rest of Serbia, but not to Kosovo. But a member of CESID's election monitoring team in Mitrovica said the lack of international support may have affected voter turnout. 'The small number of voters is the result of the lack of election publicity, there are no international observers or support, and maybe the lack of financial support has been a reason to do with that.' Oliver Ivanovic, who is the nominal head of the Serb community in Mitrovica, said people did not give the polls the same importance as the last one. 'Of course, the people are much more relaxed now, and of course some democratisation started in Belgrade some months ago, but we know very well that this democratisation is not finished yet. While a few voters continued to arrive at the schools used as polling stations in the city, the majority of Mitrovica's population were at the weekend market of stalls lined along the main road in the town centre. 'This time I don't know a thing,' said Miriana Cevic, a 23-year-old unemployed town planning graduate, working at a cigarette stall. 'Yes I'll vote, it's my duty as a citizen, but for whom? Well, as I said last time, for the winner!'",

      "body": "<p>In the town that started it all, Christmas is cancelled. The choirs from around the world that were planning to hallelujah in the first Christmas of the second millennium are not going to make it. To go there these days is to enter a war zone. Some days it is just quiet, almost dull. Every now and then the tourist trap created in the birthplace of the Son of God explodes as tank shells slam in.</p> <p>A roadblock on the edge of Bethlehem. On this side of the line, Greater Israel, sprawling across the occupied territories, a First World go-getting internet economy that has absorbed a million Russian Jews in a decade. On the other side of the line, the Bantustan of Bethlehem, an Arab-majority town controlled by the Palestine Authority, but entirely encircled by the fire power of the Israeli Defence Force. And in the middle, trying to cross the line in a small and battered car, the head teacher of a local kindergarten, Grace Abu Mohor. Grace is a Christian Arab, of Greek Orthodox family, a tiny fireball of a woman with a riotous sense of the ridiculous and a contagious laugh. In the car with her are two tots who go to the kindergarten, aged three and four.</p> <p>The Israelis have closed the road to traffic, so that Palestinian cars with green plates cannot enter Israel, and Israeli vehicles with yellow plates cannot enter Bethlehem. This is a new restriction, and it has caught out the mother of the two kids. Although an Arab, she's got yellow plates and cannot drive into Bethlehem to get to the kindergarten and pick up her children.</p> <p>Grace has got a huge amount on her plate. Not least, her home overlooks the Israeli settlement of Gilo. Palestinian gunmen have peppered Gilo with AK fire; the Israelis have fired back with tank shells. Suddenly, her home, historically a peaceable and plush Christian-Arab village, is on a front line that didn't exist before.</p> <p>But Grace is a head teacher down to her boots. She feels that she cannot trust the two kids to a taxi driver. They are too young. So she drives up towards the checkpoint, hoping that with her innocent cargo on board she can talk her way through the roadblock and deliver the children safe and sound to their mother.</p> <p>The dividing line is on a narrow road on top of a bluff. Under a lowering sky, on the far horizon, you can see the domes, minarets and hotel skyscrapers of Jerusalem. Close by, across a deep wadi, is Gilo, a kind of Basildon New Town, homes made of brash new concrete on the top of the hill. Gilo is built on Arab land, of course. It's part of a ring of settlements that encircle Jerusalem and deepen the gloom of the Palestinians. How can they ever have their own state, they say, if Israel keeps building these settlements? You can feel the tension on the line.</p> <p>Witness the stylised humility of the Palestinian drivers, trying to get through the block. They are Arab drivers with yellow plates who have been literally wrongsided by the new rules, and are now desperate to get their vehicles back across the line, in case they are trapped. Witness, too, the morose arrogance of the squaddies of the Israeli Defence Force. They display a studied toughness they've drunk in from Hollywood. There are four or five of them on the road, automatic rifles strapped to their backs. There is a promise of rain, but even so, one of them is still sporting sunglasses. One is tempted to say, 'You look a right twit in those, son,' but he has a gun. None of them is older than 22.</p> <p>Their helmets look weird. The soldiers are sporting floppy camouflage bonnets on top of their helmets, as big and silly as the Eccy Thump flat caps worn by the Tetley tea-bag workers, making their heads look huge and misshapen. The reason? The helmet covers will confuse the aim of Palestinian snipers who may or may not be out there.</p> <p>As the Israeli soldiers strut their stuff, I wonder what's going on inside their helmets. I'm Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator 2. Actually, I'm Arnie from Tel Aviv, and I'm only 20, and I don't want a bullet tunnelling through my brain at 900mph. I don't want to be kidnapped. But I'm not going to let any of my mates on the checkpoint sniff my fear, so I'm going to play it as tough as hell.</p> <p>And here, into the middle of this display of overdog testosterone and underdog anger, comes Grace in her scruffy car with the kids in the back. To control the traffic and show who is boss, the Israelis have created a very tight chicane, by putting down tyre-killing 'shark teeth'. These are strips of heavy black plastic in which are embedded razor-sharp metal teeth, pointing up.</p> <p>Grace, anxious, slips her car through a gap between a bus and the shark's teeth and gently nudges towards the line. She almost makes it. But the Israeli soldier with the shades, who has been distracted by giving the bus driver a hard time, sees the banned green numberplate and erupts. He can't see the kids. They are too low in their seats. He is raging with fury at Grace, screaming: 'Get back, get back!' Grace wants to get out and say her piece, but she can't leave the kids, and stalls. The soldier becomes yet more enraged at the stupid, bloody woman blocking the roadblock: 'GET BACK, GET BACK!'</p> <p>Panicking now, Grace reverses back, and blows three of her tyres on the shark's teeth.</p> <p>O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie.</p> <p>It's her fault and it's not her fault. The shark's teeth, being low to the ground, couldn't be seen in her rear-view mirror. The kids are crying, Grace is rattled, angry with herself and the soldier, her car immobilised. The soldier snaps that he didn't let her tyres down, and walks away to block our taxi, with yellow plates, from entering Bethlehem.</p> <p>Grace uses her mobile to call the children's mother. They are picked up with lots of cuddles and stroking of hair, the mother grateful at Grace's effort, and appalled at the three flat tyres. She leaves Grace, who says she is fine and it will be no problem. Then the rain starts to fall, and Grace is all but crying at the stupidity of it all.</p> <p>It's not the soldier's fault. He was, as they say, only obeying orders. His tension, his fear, his souped-up testosterone blocked him from looking into the scruffy car and seeing what was in there. They might have been terrorists. But actually they were only Grace and two very small kids. And there you've got it: the agony of the Holy Land in three burst tyres at the Bethlehem checkpoint.</p> <p>Humanity has a way of seeping through the cracks of adversity. A few Arab teenagers pimp-roll past, see Grace's predicament and, as the rain becomes heavier and heavier, they get stuck in. They change the one good tyre in the boot and arrange for a taxi driver to go down into Bethlehem and buy two new tyres. It's partly common human decency. It's partly a way at getting at the Israeli soldiers. Hey - look, guys! You bully the poor woman into blowing her tyres. We help her out. Call yourself men? None of this is stated. It's all acted out, a silent ballet of puncture repair.</p> <p>A minibus arrives, in it teachers from Grace's school, going to their homes in Jerusalem. They are Americans, men and women from the moon. They take in the scene, the three flats, the shark's teeth, the soldiers barking at some new trespasser on their authority. In the battle for the world's sympathy, Israel loses a few more votes to Palestine. Our taxi is stuck on the yellow-plated side of the line, but Grace agrees to play tour guide.</p> <p>The first stop on the bang-bang tourist's Bethlehem is pretty impressive, if you like looking at the intestines of washing machines. The washing machine has taken a direct hit from a tank shell. What's seriously odd is that the front of the machine is almost intact, the white plastic casing slewed and twisted but the makers, 'Frigidaire', and the options 'spin' 'wool' 'rinse only' all still readable. Behind the plastic front, a dirty great hole has been bored through by the shell, wrecking the drum and turning the motor into a puddle of metal. A commotion at the door: another bang-bang tourist has shown up, a tall, silver-haired priest, Father Gockel Guido, a Mill Hill Father working for the Papal Nuncio to the Holy Land. The priest inspects the washing machine.</p> <p>Tracing the flight path from the washing machine backwards is not exactly difficult. The shell came into the washing machine through a hole in the wall, beyond that the Nazal children's bedroom: a litter of cuddly animals, swaddled in dust and crumbled chunks of wall; a kid's toy-car dashboard, the speedo set to 140mph; kids' clothes, shredded; a Super School Bus Band music machine covered in muck; a mirror smashed to pieces. The shell had entered the house through a window of the kids' bedroom, gone straight through the internal wall and bedded itself in the washing machine.</p> <p>We are in the suburb of Bethlehem known as Beit Jela, and in the Christian area down the hill from The Church of St Nicholas. The hillside is heavily built up, old Ottoman houses leaning on each other, cheek by jowl.</p> <p>'The children were sleeping in the room and they woke up and we could hear the sound of gunfire. So we moved them to the back room. And then it happened,' says the man of the house. His wife, Suha Nazal, looks at her four-year-old boy and her two-year-old girl, the rubble, the puddle of metal that used to be her washing machine, and says nothing.</p> <p>'What time did it happen?' asks the priest. '11.30 at night,' the man says. So they were firing tank shells into a heavily built-up area, blind.</p> <p>Outside, more destruction. Another shell had crashed into a garage, chewing up a wall and a motorcar, but hurting no one. Up the hill was the most spectacular shot of all. The tank shell had crashed in on the corner of a house that stood proud above the road up towards the church, and taken out a hole 5ft deep by 3ft wide. It, too, had been a bedroom. Now charred bedding, shredded blankets and chunks of wall crackle underfoot. The house is 150 years old, the wall more than a foot thick, built to last. One of the boys of the house picks up what was left of the shell, a base, weirdly compressed by its impact with the wall. It is the size of a big ashtray, but as heavy as 10 housebricks. The family has 11 children: five boys and six girls. By some wonder, none of them was killed. They had all been sheltering in the back room. The mother, Manua Jamil Muslat, sits on a sofa, crying that the children just can't get to sleep at nights. They all think it will happen again, she says. She wears a headscarf cowled round her face like Rembrandt's mother. Next to her, a 10-year-old boy shivers with fear.</p> <p>Grace drives us to her house, now on the front line. From her front room you can part the net curtains and clearly see the other side of the wadi, on it the Basildon New Town of Gilo, and just in front of the last houses, two tanks, the long black arms of the guns point directly at us. She shows us Manger Square, which is empty, and the low porch to the Church of the Holy Nativity, built to prevent men on horseback from running amok inside. Normally, Bethlehem is chock-a-block with tourists, coaches, guides gibbering away. Now the whole place is as empty as Bournemouth Pier on a wet November morning. And the birthplace itself? It is, as TS Eliot wrote in Journey of the Magi, you may say, satisfactory.</p> <p><b> The tanks in Gilo are not difficult to find, the </b> bullet holes fired from the Palestinian side less so. The first shock on approaching Gilo is the roadblock. It doesn't exist. You can drive straight from the centre of Jerusalem into Gilo, and no one checks your passport or hassles you about your numberplates or searches your boot.</p> <p>No roadblocks, but word blocks aplenty. Settler Uri Bank, 32, strolls up to us, checks our IDs, offers his help. He tells us that he lives in Gilo and is chief of staff for Benny Elon, MP, chairman of the National Union-Israel faction, which is further to the right than Likud.</p> <p>Where are the bullet holes? The bullets fired by the Palestinian gunmen that necessitate the tank shells by way of reply? I look around, expecting to see a Gruy\u00e8re of bullet holes, sickeningly familiar from Vukovar, Sarajevo and Kosovo. Nothing. Uri points to a black hole in a concrete wall, as insignificant as a blackhead on one of the Mount Rushmore faces. 'See, that's a bullet hole.'</p> <p>I loan him my binoculars and show him the house across the wadi on the Palestinian side with the hole made by the tank shell, and resist the temptation to say: 'That's what I call a bullet hole.' You can even see the hole with the naked eye. But I do tell him there were 11 children in the house when the tank shell made that hole.</p> <p>Uri, who speaks virtually flawless English with an American accent, does not draw breath. 'We're actually being too soft with the terrorists.' I repeat that there were 11 children in the house.</p> <p>'Then they should take a vacation with a relative in Nablus.' This is another Palestinian-controlled town on the West Bank. I saw five young Palestinians shot dead there one afternoon. The dead included a 12-year-old. The back of his head was blown off by a bullet.</p> <p>Uri gestures to the other side of the wadi: 'The civilians that stay there are accomplices to terrorism. You cannot expect Israel not to shoot back. More than 20 apartments in Gilo have been hit with bullets. It's a miracle that we haven't had any dead civilians. Our army is being told to go soft, to use too much restraint. If they shoot at a civilian neighbourhood, the army should reply with full fire. And helicopters should be brought in. If people in Golders Green were being shot up, Tony Blair wouldn't allow this to happen. No country would allow this to happen without massive retaliation.'</p> <p>'... and everywhere <br> The ceremony of innocence is drowned; <br> The best lack all conviction, while the worst <br> Are full of passionate intensity.'<br> <b>WB Yeats</b></p> <p>As often happens, the Israeli soldiers who actually fire the tank shells at the target are much less hardcore than the men who egg them on to greater inhumanity. They sit around sunbathing, chatting, munching biscuits in the bored way of soldiers everywhere. In the most forwardly position of all are an Israeli photographer and three spotters, one of whom is wearing tank fatigues. He is a gentle man, who offers us biscuits. I ask: 'What's happening?'</p> <p>And the tankie says: 'They shoot at us, and we shoot at them.' He says it in such a bored, matter-of-fact way that the others laugh. I want to tell him about the consequences of his work, when something happens. One of the tanks revs up its engine and its gun turret swivels and arrests, locked on to an unseen target. The officer comes and shoos us away.</p> <p>The Israeli photographer, Nir, listens to my description of the other side, and grimaces. 'I'm on the left - I don't like the right, the settlers. But, hell, they're shooting at us.' I repeat the imbalance, show him the hole in the house on the other side of the wadi. He studies it and reflects: 'Israel's strength is its weakness. Their weakness is their strength.'</p> <p>I had set out to meet a head teacher, an Israeli version of Grace. But at the local school the reception is a cold one. Everybody is locked into their own roles, as if they are actors in a play. On the Palestinian side, people are warm to Western journalists; on the Israeli side, they are cold. I saw the same in Bosnia - the Muslims friendly, the Serbs always standoffish to begin with, often paranoid, occasionally just short of murderous. After a time, you can break these barriers down and the real people shine through. But in Israel, these days, there is no time.</p> <p>The school caretaker will not allow us to stay in the lobby. The secretary, too, gives us the cold shoulder. But a teacher finds us and starts chatting. The caretaker objects, and we walk off the school property.</p> <p>Hannah is a special-needs teacher, deeply distressed at what is happening now. 'The children are very jumpy. When somebody drops a book on the floor and it makes a bang, everyone leaps up.'</p> <p>Had she been over there, I ask, pointing to the town barely half a mile away. 'Yes, I have been there, and I want to go again. I want to go to Bethlehem. We are neighbours, not enemies. We used to go there, but not now. It's a shame that they are shooting at us.'</p> <p>And then she has to go.</p> <p>The suffering in the Holy Land's latest war is not equal. The dying started after Israel's right-wing opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, inspected a contested holy site in Jerusalem. Since then, 270 people have been killed: of those, 70 are Israeli and 200 Palestinian; of the Palestinian dead, 70 have been children.</p> <p>Both causes have right on their side. The Palestinians see themselves in a liberation struggle against a hated colonial power. The Israelis are defending themselves from racist attack, the memory of the Holocaust never to be forgotten. It is like watching two people with terrible migraines blaming, then fighting each other in the same room. The Palestinians can be accused with some justification of self-mortification. You can question why parents let their 12-year-olds out on to the streets. But these reflections do not change the big picture. The Israelis are killing Palestinians at a ratio of three to one. After a while, one begins to wonder at the ferocity of the Israelis' response, as if they are suffering from battered-child syndrome on a terrifying scale.</p> <p>From the roof of Rabbi Michael Melchior's home in southern Jerusalem, you can see Bethlehem. The rabbi leads a strange anomaly, a left-wing religious political party that is a part of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's governing coalition. He's the minister for the Jewish Diaspora - until the elections take place in February. His grandfather led Denmark's Jews to safety in Sweden, perhaps the only Jewish community in Nazi-occupied Europe that escaped virtually intact.</p> <p>Rabbi Melchior is a warm and witty man, who feels anger at the Palestinians for throwing away the chance of peace and a state, offered to them by Barak: 'I personally feel deep frustration and disappointment. What is happening now is totally unnecessary. The Palestinians were offered exactly what they are fighting for.'</p> <p>That said, he's aware that compromise is the only way forward: 'I believe in religious dialogue. There are not so many in this market,' he jokes. 'The Middle East conflict is about two peoples claiming the same land. It can only be solved by territorial compromise. The problem is, if you turn it into a religious conflict, then it becomes my God against your God, then... We have to do everything to get back together, to talk again.'</p> <p>The rabbi's voice is not, by any means, the loudest these days.</p> <p>Tank shells, machine-gun bullets, automatic rifle rounds scream louder. A few days ago, Grace's home was hit again. Her lounge looks like Gruy\u00e8re, her vacuum got blasted and there are 40 Israeli bullet holes in her home. With her sister and her elderly aunt, she's had to move out from the family home.</p> <p>Christmas? In Bethlehem? It's not exactly Jingle Bells.</p>",

But I'm not going to let any of my mates on the checkpoint sniff my fear, so I'm going to play it as tough as hell.

To control the traffic and show who is boss, the Israelis have created a very tight chicane, by putting down tyre-killing 'shark teeth'.

The soldier becomes yet more enraged at the stupid, bloody woman blocking the roadblock: 'GET BACK, GET BACK!' Panicking now, Grace reverses back, and blows three of her tyres on the shark's teeth. O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie. It's her fault and it's not her fault. The shark's teeth, being low to the ground, couldn't be seen in her rear-view mirror. The kids are crying, Grace is rattled, angry with herself and the soldier, her car immobilised. The soldier snaps that he didn't let her tyres down, and walks away to block our taxi, with yellow plates, from entering Bethlehem. Grace uses her mobile to call the children's mother. They are picked up with lots of cuddles and stroking of hair, the mother grateful at Grace's effort, and appalled at the three flat tyres. She leaves Grace, who says she is fine and it will be no problem. Then the rain starts to fall, and Grace is all but crying at the stupidity of it all. It's not the soldier's fault. He was, as they say, only obeying orders. His tension, his fear, his souped-up testosterone blocked him from looking into the scruffy car and seeing what was in there. They might have been terrorists. But actually they were only Grace and two very small kids. And there you've got it: the agony of the Holy Land in three burst tyres at the Bethlehem checkpoint. Humanity has a way of seeping through the cracks of adversity. A few Arab teenagers pimp-roll past, see Grace's predicament and, as the rain becomes heavier and heavier, they get stuck in. They change the one good tyre in the boot and arrange for a taxi driver to go down into Bethlehem and buy two new tyres. It's partly common human decency. It's partly a way at getting at the Israeli soldiers. Hey - look, guys! You bully the poor woman into blowing her tyres. We help her out. Call yourself men? None of this is stated. It's all acted out, a silent ballet of puncture repair. A minibus arrives, in it teachers from Grace's school, going to their homes in Jerusalem. They are Americans, men and women from the moon. They take in the scene, the three flats, the shark's teeth, the soldiers barking at some new trespasser on their authority. In the battle for the world's sympathy, Israel loses a few more votes to Palestine. Our taxi is stuck on the yellow-plated side of the line, but Grace agrees to play tour guide. The first stop on the bang-bang tourist's Bethlehem is pretty impressive, if you like looking at the intestines of washing machines. The washing machine has taken a direct hit from a tank shell. What's seriously odd is that the front of the machine is almost intact, the white plastic casing slewed and twisted but the makers, 'Frigidaire', and the options 'spin' 'wool' 'rinse only' all still readable. Behind the plastic front, a dirty great hole has been bored through by the shell, wrecking the drum and turning the motor into a puddle of metal. A commotion at the door: another bang-bang tourist has shown up, a tall, silver-haired priest, Father Gockel Guido, a Mill Hill Father working for the Papal Nuncio to the Holy Land. The priest inspects the washing machine. Tracing the flight path from the washing machine backwards is not exactly difficult. The shell came into the washing machine through a hole in the wall, beyond that the Nazal children's bedroom: a litter of cuddly animals, swaddled in dust and crumbled chunks of wall; a kid's toy-car dashboard, the speedo set to 140mph; kids' clothes, shredded; a Super School Bus Band music machine covered in muck; a mirror smashed to pieces. The shell had entered the house through a window of the kids' bedroom, gone straight through the internal wall and bedded itself in the washing machine. We are in the suburb of Bethlehem known as Beit Jela, and in the Christian area down the hill from The Church of St Nicholas. The hillside is heavily built up, old Ottoman houses leaning on each other, cheek by jowl. 'The children were sleeping in the room and they woke up and we could hear the sound of gunfire. So we moved them to the back room. And then it happened,' says the man of the house. His wife, Suha Nazal, looks at her four-year-old boy and her two-year-old girl, the rubble, the puddle of metal that used to be her washing machine, and says nothing. 'What time did it happen?' asks the priest. '11.30 at night,' the man says. So they were firing tank shells into a heavily built-up area, blind. Outside, more destruction. Another shell had crashed into a garage, chewing up a wall and a motorcar, but hurting no one. Up the hill was the most spectacular shot of all. The tank shell had crashed in on the corner of a house that stood proud above the road up towards the church, and taken out a hole 5ft deep by 3ft wide. It, too, had been a bedroom. Now charred bedding, shredded blankets and chunks of wall crackle underfoot. The house is 150 years old, the wall more than a foot thick, built to last. One of the boys of the house picks up what was left of the shell, a base, weirdly compressed by its impact with the wall. It is the size of a big ashtray, but as heavy as 10 housebricks. The family has 11 children: five boys and six girls. By some wonder, none of them was killed. They had all been sheltering in the back room. The mother, Manua Jamil Muslat, sits on a sofa, crying that the children just can't get to sleep at nights. They all think it will happen again, she says. She wears a headscarf cowled round her face like Rembrandt's mother. Next to her, a 10-year-old boy shivers with fear. Grace drives us to her house, now on the front line. From her front room you can part the net curtains and clearly see the other side of the wadi, on it the Basildon New Town of Gilo, and just in front of the last houses, two tanks, the long black arms of the guns point directly at us. She shows us Manger Square, which is empty, and the low porch to the Church of the Holy Nativity, built to prevent men on horseback from running amok inside. Normally, Bethlehem is chock-a-block with tourists, coaches, guides gibbering away. Now the whole place is as empty as Bournemouth Pier on a wet November morning. And the birthplace itself? It is, as TS Eliot wrote in Journey of the Magi, you may say, satisfactory. The tanks in Gilo are not difficult to find, the bullet holes fired from the Palestinian side less so. The first shock on approaching Gilo is the roadblock. It doesn't exist. You can drive straight from the centre of Jerusalem into Gilo, and no one checks your passport or hassles you about your numberplates or searches your boot. No roadblocks, but word blocks aplenty. Settler Uri Bank, 32, strolls up to us, checks our IDs, offers his help. He tells us that he lives in Gilo and is chief of staff for Benny Elon, MP, chairman of the National Union-Israel faction, which is further to the right than Likud. Where are the bullet holes? The bullets fired by the Palestinian gunmen that necessitate the tank shells by way of reply? I look around, expecting to see a Gruy\u00e8re of bullet holes, sickeningly familiar from Vukovar, Sarajevo and Kosovo. Nothing. Uri points to a black hole in a concrete wall, as insignificant as a blackhead on one of the Mount Rushmore faces. 'See, that's a bullet hole.' I loan him my binoculars and show him the house across the wadi on the Palestinian side with the hole made by the tank shell, and resist the temptation to say: 'That's what I call a bullet hole.' You can even see the hole with the naked eye. But I do tell him there were 11 children in the house when the tank shell made that hole. Uri, who speaks virtually flawless English with an American accent, does not draw breath. 'We're actually being too soft with the terrorists.' I repeat that there were 11 children in the house. 'Then they should take a vacation with a relative in Nablus.' This is another Palestinian-controlled town on the West Bank. I saw five young Palestinians shot dead there one afternoon. The dead included a 12-year-old. The back of his head was blown off by a bullet. Uri gestures to the other side of the wadi: 'The civilians that stay there are accomplices to terrorism. You cannot expect Israel not to shoot back. More than 20 apartments in Gilo have been hit with bullets. It's a miracle that we haven't had any dead civilians. Our army is being told to go soft, to use too much restraint. If they shoot at a civilian neighbourhood, the army should reply with full fire. And helicopters should be brought in. If people in Golders Green were being shot up, Tony Blair wouldn't allow this to happen. No country would allow this to happen without massive retaliation.' '... and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity.' WB Yeats As often happens, the Israeli soldiers who actually fire the tank shells at the target are much less hardcore than the men who egg them on to greater inhumanity. They sit around sunbathing, chatting, munching biscuits in the bored way of soldiers everywhere. In the most forwardly position of all are an Israeli photographer and three spotters, one of whom is wearing tank fatigues. He is a gentle man, who offers us biscuits. I ask: 'What's happening?' And the tankie says: 'They shoot at us, and we shoot at them.' He says it in such a bored, matter-of-fact way that the others laugh. I want to tell him about the consequences of his work, when something happens. One of the tanks revs up its engine and its gun turret swivels and arrests, locked on to an unseen target. The officer comes and shoos us away. The Israeli photographer, Nir, listens to my description of the other side, and grimaces. 'I'm on the left - I don't like the right, the settlers. But, hell, they're shooting at us.' I repeat the imbalance, show him the hole in the house on the other side of the wadi. He studies it and reflects: 'Israel's strength is its weakness. Their weakness is their strength.' I had set out to meet a head teacher, an Israeli version of Grace. But at the local school the reception is a cold one. Everybody is locked into their own roles, as if they are actors in a play. On the Palestinian side, people are warm to Western journalists; on the Israeli side, they are cold. I saw the same in Bosnia - the Muslims friendly, the Serbs always standoffish to begin with, often paranoid, occasionally just short of murderous. After a time, you can break these barriers down and the real people shine through. But in Israel, these days, there is no time. The school caretaker will not allow us to stay in the lobby. The secretary, too, gives us the cold shoulder. But a teacher finds us and starts chatting. The caretaker objects, and we walk off the school property. Hannah is a special-needs teacher, deeply distressed at what is happening now. 'The children are very jumpy. When somebody drops a book on the floor and it makes a bang, everyone leaps up.' Had she been over there, I ask, pointing to the town barely half a mile away. 'Yes, I have been there, and I want to go again. I want to go to Bethlehem. We are neighbours, not enemies. We used to go there, but not now. It's a shame that they are shooting at us.' And then she has to go. The suffering in the Holy Land's latest war is not equal. The dying started after Israel's right-wing opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, inspected a contested holy site in Jerusalem. Since then, 270 people have been killed: of those, 70 are Israeli and 200 Palestinian; of the Palestinian dead, 70 have been children. Both causes have right on their side. The Palestinians see themselves in a liberation struggle against a hated colonial power. The Israelis are defending themselves from racist attack, the memory of the Holocaust never to be forgotten. It is like watching two people with terrible migraines blaming, then fighting each other in the same room. The Palestinians can be accused with some justification of self-mortification. You can question why parents let their 12-year-olds out on to the streets. But these reflections do not change the big picture. The Israelis are killing Palestinians at a ratio of three to one. After a while, one begins to wonder at the ferocity of the Israelis' response, as if they are suffering from battered-child syndrome on a terrifying scale. From the roof of Rabbi Michael Melchior's home in southern Jerusalem, you can see Bethlehem. The rabbi leads a strange anomaly, a left-wing religious political party that is a part of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's governing coalition. He's the minister for the Jewish Diaspora - until the elections take place in February. His grandfather led Denmark's Jews to safety in Sweden, perhaps the only Jewish community in Nazi-occupied Europe that escaped virtually intact. Rabbi Melchior is a warm and witty man, who feels anger at the Palestinians for throwing away the chance of peace and a state, offered to them by Barak: 'I personally feel deep frustration and disappointment. What is happening now is totally unnecessary. The Palestinians were offered exactly what they are fighting for.' That said, he's aware that compromise is the only way forward: 'I believe in religious dialogue. There are not so many in this market,' he jokes. 'The Middle East conflict is about two peoples claiming the same land. It can only be solved by territorial compromise. The problem is, if you turn it into a religious conflict, then it becomes my God against your God, then... We have to do everything to get back together, to talk again.' The rabbi's voice is not, by any means, the loudest these days. Tank shells, machine-gun bullets, automatic rifle rounds scream louder. A few days ago, Grace's home was hit again. Her lounge looks like Gruy\u00e8re, her vacuum got blasted and there are 40 Israeli bullet holes in her home. With her sister and her elderly aunt, she's had to move out from the family home. Christmas? In Bethlehem? It's not exactly Jingle Bells.",

This season they must surely beg you to direct your thoughts to the most deluded group being cared for in our 'community'. Although outwardly pampered, its members believe they have been robbed blind; although no one stems their wild talk, they see themselves as persecuted dissidents. They are trapped in a fantastic and menacing mental universe which I will call Widdeworld.</p> <p>In Widdeworld, the Widdemen and women hold these truths to be self-evident.</p> <p><b> 1. Really, if the lower orders don't set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them?</b></p> <p>Wilde's tender feelings for the male sex ensured that all his writings were forgotten by Widdeworlders save for the inspirational thought from The Importance of Being Earnest that if the poor were not always with us, the rich wouldn't know how to behave.</p> <p>Ann Widdecombe was obliged to abandon her harsh line on cannabis in October after her colleagues in the Shadow Cabinet told her they had been doped out of their heads in their youth. She confessed to the Guardian that she had never wanted the police to arrest Conservative supporters. She was 'keen to stress her policy is not targeted at middle-class people experimenting at university, but at blocking the supply of drugs in run-down estates'.</p> <p>The Times reported that members of the audience at a Conservative Future meeting had sworn that they had heard Philip Hammond, the Tory MP for Runnymede and Weybridge, say: 'It is more acceptable for middle-class educated people to use cannabis than working-class people on run-down council estates.' Hammond, alas, exiled himself from respectable society when he disowned this sound Widdeist sentiment.</p> <p>Despite his trimming, it remains incontestable that all notions of equality before the law should be abandoned because in Widdeworld it is poverty, not property, that is theft. Everyone accepts that:</p> <p><b> 2. The poor are poor because they are stealing all our money.</b></p> <p>In June we learned that this seeming paradox had been resolved by Marvin Olasky - an orthodox Jew turned Marxist atheist turned Christian fundamentalist, who earned the wisdom needed to advise George W Bush and William Hague while teaching journalists at the University of Texas, no less. 'Every time we tell someone he is a victim,' Marv explained, 'every time we say he deserves a special break, every time we hand out charity to someone capable of working, we are hurting rather than helping.'</p> <p>Olasky saw for himself how the poor's dupes were conned into giving them luxuries rather than the essentials of life when he dressed in the rags of a beggar and stumbled onto the streets. He was offered food and shelter by the credulous, but was astonished to find his craving for a Bible was left unsatisfied. Without the Word of God to guide them, the destitute failed yet again to set a good example to their betters. They remained nothing more than 'the victims and perpetrators of illegitimacy and abandonment'.</p> <p>Alan Duncan, a Tory MP and one of William Hague's spin doctors, agreed that the welfare state led the poor into the wicked ways of the rich. 'When unemployment benefit and income support [are provided] by the Department of Social Security,' he wrote in his apology for his life, Saturn's Children, 'the effect is not to enlarge the moral opportunities open to individuals but to narrow them.'</p> <p>Both accepted that the only way out of a depraved dependency culture is to get a job. The poor should not, however, expect to receive a living wage for their labours. For in Widdeworld it is axiomatic that:</p> <p><b> 3. It is bad for business if work makes the poor richer.</b></p> <p>One of the first acts of the New Labour Government was to legislate for a minimum wage at the paltry level of \u00a33.70 an hour. Christopher Chope, a Conservative MP, feared that capitalism would be brought to its knees. 'Why should firms be penalised by having to pay slow, handicapped or disabled people the minimum wage?' he cried at the Conservative Party Conference.</p> <p>The same question is not asked of managers because it is a truth universally acknowledged that:</p> <p><b> 4. The rich won't work unless they are made richer still.</b></p> <p>Ruth Lea, chief booster of the Institute of Directors and economic pontificator of choice for the impartial BBC, had a triumphant 2000 when she explained Rules Three and Four of Widdeworld without pausing for breath. One minute she warned that raising the minimum wage would render 'the most vulnerable unemployable'; the next she admitted that pay rises for managers running at four times the shop-floor rate were 'a bit mad' and 'not moral', but, nevertheless, could not be criticised because, 'it's the way the international markets work these days'. Her defence of the accumulation of pelf by mediocrities was dismissed as self-serving cant by lefties but was seen as enormously courageous in Widdeworld where:</p> <p><b> 5. It is an act of conspicuous bravery to take on the tyrannical 'liberal \u00e9lite'.</b></p> <p>Wage inequality between rich and poor has never been greater since records began in the 1880s. The public sector has decayed to the point of rottenness and beyond. Ancient liberties - the presumption of innocence, true trial by jury and the right to silence - are dead or dying. The senior judiciary is notorious for its ignorance of all rights except property rights.</p> <p>These vices have flourished with barely a murmur from official liberalism and have been fertilised by a brutish Labour Home Secretary. For all that, Wee Widde Hague had the sheer bloody guts to proclaim in May that 'liberal orthodoxy has perverted the criminal justice system for 40 years'. A prison population which stood at 65,000 - the highest in Western Europe - was a living symbol of their decadence. He proposed to increase it to 85,000, double what it was when he first went, wide-eyed, into John Major's Cabinet in 1992.</p> <p>Effete liberalism, which is supported by no one in office, is denounced in Widdeworld because it contests the truism that:</p> <p><b> 6. Black children are being murdered because the police aren't racist enough.</b></p> <p>Thus Hague announced that a terrible consequence of the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence and the failure to bring the culprits to justice by an institutionally racist Metropolitan Police force was that the stopping and searching of suspects (a disproportionately large number of whom were black) by officers had fallen by 7,000 a month. It quickly emerged that stops and searches in London had, in fact, fallen by 700. It further transpired that blacks were exempted from the general indulgence and virtually all the trivial decline in stops and searches could be accounted for by the police responding to the Macpherson Report by curtailing the stopping and searching of whites.</p> <p>Hague refused to apologise. Even when the families of Stephen Lawrence and Damilola Taylor begged him to leave their children's graves alone, he told Jimmy Young that he would not 'be bullied into silence' by monstrous parents who wanted to preserve their dead boys' dignity.</p> <p>What is curious is that the laws of Widdeworld are losing their power. They served the Conservatives well enough for 18 years. The most successful papers in the admittedly declining British press - the Sun , Mail and Telegraph - still treat them as sacred writ. New Labour has paid lip service and more to most of them, proving again that it is very difficult to attack this Government from the Right.</p> <p>Perhaps the press connection is the strongest reason for the failure. The apparent Conservative strength may be its greatest weakness. It is all very well ranting about the moral lessons of Damilola without visiting Peckham or picking up a phone. (If you work on the opinion pages of the Mail - you don't prosper if you confront complexity.) But politicians are not pundits. If they conceal, there remains a chance - vanishingly faint, but none the less real - that they will be scuppered.</p> <p>Michael Portillo seems to understand this, and to have grasped that the most effective assault on New Labour would be to counter authoritarianism with freedom. Under his government you would be free to hunt foxes and make obscene sums in the City, but you would also be free to demonstrate and be tried by a jury and keep the state out of your bedroom.</p> <p>Yet the Conservative press hates Portillo - not least because he had a brief Wildean passion of his own. It condemns its party to live in Widdeworld, a far-away country of which we have heard too much, for far too long.</p>",

Wilde's tender feelings for the male sex ensured that all his writings were forgotten by Widdeworlders save for the inspirational thought from The Importance of Being Earnest that if the poor were not always with us, the rich wouldn't know how to behave. Ann Widdecombe was obliged to abandon her harsh line on cannabis in October after her colleagues in the Shadow Cabinet told her they had been doped out of their heads in their youth. She confessed to the Guardian that she had never wanted the police to arrest Conservative supporters. She was 'keen to stress her policy is not targeted at middle-class people experimenting at university, but at blocking the supply of drugs in run-down estates'. The Times reported that members of the audience at a Conservative Future meeting had sworn that they had heard Philip Hammond, the Tory MP for Runnymede and Weybridge, say: 'It is more acceptable for middle-class educated people to use cannabis than working-class people on run-down council estates.' Hammond, alas, exiled himself from respectable society when he disowned this sound Widdeist sentiment. Despite his trimming, it remains incontestable that all notions of equality before the law should be abandoned because in Widdeworld it is poverty, not property, that is theft. Everyone accepts that: 2. The poor are poor because they are stealing all our money. In June we learned that this seeming paradox had been resolved by Marvin Olasky - an orthodox Jew turned Marxist atheist turned Christian fundamentalist, who earned the wisdom needed to advise George W Bush and William Hague while teaching journalists at the University of Texas, no less. 'Every time we tell someone he is a victim,' Marv explained, 'every time we say he deserves a special break, every time we hand out charity to someone capable of working, we are hurting rather than helping.' Olasky saw for himself how the poor's dupes were conned into giving them luxuries rather than the essentials of life when he dressed in the rags of a beggar and stumbled onto the streets. He was offered food and shelter by the credulous, but was astonished to find his craving for a Bible was left unsatisfied. Without the Word of God to guide them, the destitute failed yet again to set a good example to their betters. They remained nothing more than 'the victims and perpetrators of illegitimacy and abandonment'. Alan Duncan, a Tory MP and one of William Hague's spin doctors, agreed that the welfare state led the poor into the wicked ways of the rich. 'When unemployment benefit and income support [are provided] by the Department of Social Security,' he wrote in his apology for his life, Saturn's Children, 'the effect is not to enlarge the moral opportunities open to individuals but to narrow them.' Both accepted that the only way out of a depraved dependency culture is to get a job. The poor should not, however, expect to receive a living wage for their labours. For in Widdeworld it is axiomatic that: 3. It is bad for business if work makes the poor richer. One of the first acts of the New Labour Government was to legislate for a minimum wage at the paltry level of \u00a33.70 an hour. Christopher Chope, a Conservative MP, feared that capitalism would be brought to its knees. 'Why should firms be penalised by having to pay slow, handicapped or disabled people the minimum wage?' he cried at the Conservative Party Conference. The same question is not asked of managers because it is a truth universally acknowledged that: 4. The rich won't work unless they are made richer still. Ruth Lea, chief booster of the Institute of Directors and economic pontificator of choice for the impartial BBC, had a triumphant 2000 when she explained Rules Three and Four of Widdeworld without pausing for breath. One minute she warned that raising the minimum wage would render 'the most vulnerable unemployable'; the next she admitted that pay rises for managers running at four times the shop-floor rate were 'a bit mad' and 'not moral', but, nevertheless, could not be criticised because, 'it's the way the international markets work these days'. Her defence of the accumulation of pelf by mediocrities was dismissed as self-serving cant by lefties but was seen as enormously courageous in Widdeworld where: 5. It is an act of conspicuous bravery to take on the tyrannical 'liberal \u00e9lite'. Wage inequality between rich and poor has never been greater since records began in the 1880s. The public sector has decayed to the point of rottenness and beyond. Ancient liberties - the presumption of innocence, true trial by jury and the right to silence - are dead or dying. The senior judiciary is notorious for its ignorance of all rights except property rights. These vices have flourished with barely a murmur from official liberalism and have been fertilised by a brutish Labour Home Secretary. For all that, Wee Widde Hague had the sheer bloody guts to proclaim in May that 'liberal orthodoxy has perverted the criminal justice system for 40 years'. A prison population which stood at 65,000 - the highest in Western Europe - was a living symbol of their decadence. He proposed to increase it to 85,000, double what it was when he first went, wide-eyed, into John Major's Cabinet in 1992. Effete liberalism, which is supported by no one in office, is denounced in Widdeworld because it contests the truism that: 6. Black children are being murdered because the police aren't racist enough. Thus Hague announced that a terrible consequence of the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence and the failure to bring the culprits to justice by an institutionally racist Metropolitan Police force was that the stopping and searching of suspects (a disproportionately large number of whom were black) by officers had fallen by 7,000 a month. It quickly emerged that stops and searches in London had, in fact, fallen by 700. It further transpired that blacks were exempted from the general indulgence and virtually all the trivial decline in stops and searches could be accounted for by the police responding to the Macpherson Report by curtailing the stopping and searching of whites. Hague refused to apologise. Even when the families of Stephen Lawrence and Damilola Taylor begged him to leave their children's graves alone, he told Jimmy Young that he would not 'be bullied into silence' by monstrous parents who wanted to preserve their dead boys' dignity. What is curious is that the laws of Widdeworld are losing their power. They served the Conservatives well enough for 18 years. The most successful papers in the admittedly declining British press - the Sun , Mail and Telegraph - still treat them as sacred writ. New Labour has paid lip service and more to most of them, proving again that it is very difficult to attack this Government from the Right. Perhaps the press connection is the strongest reason for the failure. The apparent Conservative strength may be its greatest weakness. It is all very well ranting about the moral lessons of Damilola without visiting Peckham or picking up a phone. (If you work on the opinion pages of the Mail - you don't prosper if you confront complexity.) But politicians are not pundits. If they conceal, there remains a chance - vanishingly faint, but none the less real - that they will be scuppered. Michael Portillo seems to understand this, and to have grasped that the most effective assault on New Labour would be to counter authoritarianism with freedom. Under his government you would be free to hunt foxes and make obscene sums in the City, but you would also be free to demonstrate and be tried by a jury and keep the state out of your bedroom. Yet the Conservative press hates Portillo - not least because he had a brief Wildean passion of his own. It condemns its party to live in Widdeworld, a far-away country of which we have heard too much, for far too long.",

      "bodyText": "Israeli and Palestinian negotiators moved closer to a definitive peace settlement yesterday as Israel indicated that it was prepared to hand over de facto sovereignty of the Temple Mount complex in Jerusalem's Old City if Palestinians accepted strict limits on the number of refugee returns. Under the Washington-brokered deal, Israel would accept Palestinian control of the third holiest shrine in Islam - where the present intifada began earlier this year - but the issue of legal ownership of the site would be left unresolved. The American formula for the resolution of the status of the Temple Mount would also be applied to other areas of a final peace settlement, with the emphasis on who controls which areas, rather than on a definitive resolution of legal 'ownership'. The disclosure came as Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, in the United States for talks with American and Palestinian officials, told American- Jewish leaders that Israel was prepared to cede sovereignty over the 'surface layer' of the Temple Mount to the Palestinians, giving them effective control of the site. The contentious issues of the Temple Mount - site of the al-Aqsa mosque and known as Haram al-Sharif in the Muslim world - and of the return of up to four million Palestinian refugees - are understood to be the final sticking points holding up a peace settlement that would bring an end to almost three months of violence that has claimed 344 lives. Sources close to the negotiations have told The Observer that the two sides were closer than ever before on the issues of the return of the Occupied Territories, security guarantees for Israel in the Jordan Valley, peace-keeping arrangements after a deal is signed, and the final status of Jerusalem and the Old City. Israel is understood to be sticking to its insistence that it cannot accept the principle of refugee returns, despite intense pressure from the US to come up with a compromise formula. Palestinians demand that those who were driven from or fled from Israel - as well as their descendants, who now number several million - be allowed to return to their homes. Israel flatly refuses. Instead, America is understood to be seeking a pragmatic solution that would see Israel accept the principle of refugee return while binding Palestinians to bring about the return of only the most pressing cases. Among ideas that are understood to have been floated is that Palestinians agree to limit demands for refugee returns to those who 'were actual refugees of the conflict' and who were pre pared to return to areas of a new Palestinian state specially designated for settlement. In exchange, Israel would cede its claim to the Temple Mount, allowing Palestine to declare sovereignty over it, while Israel would retain control of the adjoining Wailing Wall and West Wall Plaza. As part of the deal Palestinians would agree not to make any physical changes to the site or undertake any archaeological excavations that would insult the sentiments of Jews who hold the Temple Mount sacred as the site of the Second Temple. The thrust of the thinking behind the present negotiations being held behind closed doors at Bolling Air Force base in Washington has been revealed in a discussion document leaked to The Observer, understood to draw heavily on the US draft proposal currently on the table. The draft peace proposal envisages that Israel will relinquish up to 75 per cent of land occupied for settlement. It will annex the remaining 25 per cent for an area currently part of Israel proper which would be added to the Gaza Strip. Israel would also give up its claims to the Muslim and Christian quarters of the Old City, while Israeli settlers in these quarters would be compensated. Israeli security concerns in the Jordan Valley would be met by a non-UN international force that would monitor the peace and border crossings.

      "byline": "Will Hutton",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I never thought I would live to see it. There has been a right-wing coup in the United States. It is now clear beyond any doubt that the winner of the Presidential election was Al Gore. In Florida the votes are being counted unofficially in a way the Supreme Court would not permit: he was already 140 votes ahead when counting stopped for Christmas and his final lead promises to be in the thousands. Nationally he leads by over half a million votes. What has happened is beyond outrage. It is the cynical misuse of power by a conservative \u00e9lite nakedly to serve its interests - and all of us should be frightened for the consequences.</p> <p>The issue is not George W. Bush's conservatism, opponent though I am of what Bush plans to do; a democracy only has vitality and political tension if its philosophy and stream of thinking is articulated and pitches to win elections. The incontrovertible abuse is that Bush has won power despite losing, and critically he only pulled off this feat because the Republicans control the Supreme Court. The Right has subverted pivotal US institutions to win power - a campaign of which the discrediting and attempted impeachment of Clinton was part - and in the process disgraced the legitimacy of US democracy at home and abroad, and undermined conceptions of the rule of law. It is a poor augury for the twenty-first century.</p> <p>In Britain the response has been woeful - itself a token of our own lack of hard democratic instincts. The commentary, especially in the right-of-centre press, has been to decry Gore as a poor loser and to insist that he had to accept the rules of the electoral game, respecting the votes in the US electoral college which, when Florida was lost, gave Bush the election. But as the great liberal defenders of freedom, Karl Popper and Isaiah Berlin, both argued when unjust, illegitimate governments win power through subverting the rules it is our responsibility to contest them.</p> <p>The nine-member Supreme Court, apart from the heady decade of the 1960s when it advanced the cause of civil rights in the South, has always been a bastion of a regressive conservatism. In the 1930s it tried to rule that key elements in Roosevelt's New Deal were unconstitutional. Its defence of the sovereignty of states rights has been fundamental in extending capital punishment and allowing bible-belt states to resist implementing federal legislation banning violence against women. Yet its general prohibition in interfering in a state's rights has been overturned in one instance; the highly politicised intervention in Florida.</p> <p>The more you examine it, the more outrageous the now famous judgement was. What the Court had to do to serve its political purpose was to find a way of acknowledging a sovereign state's rights and the continuing legitimacy of hand recounts in closely contested elections - after all George W. Bush had passed a law as Governor in Texas in 1998 endorsing hand recounts - but at the same time give the election to their Republican champion by finding that events in Florida were a special case.This was tricky. In the first place, even the conservative judges shared the unanimous view that it was reasonable for hand recounts to be undertaken because, as the judgment concedes: 'Punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunate number of ballots which are not punched in a clean, complete way by the voter.' Consequently individual states are obliged, when the winning margin is tight, to mount an effort to find out what the 'clear intent' of each voter was. In other words Gore was completely within his rights to demand the hand recount.</p> <p>The five conservatives had a problem. How could they deliver the coup? The solution was elegant. The process was too subjective, said the Supreme Court, unless the Florida court put in place even more protective measures to ensure impartiality than the Florida legislature had provided for - a position that is constitutionally impossible, as the judges knew, because it meant the Court would have to change rather than interpret Florida law. Hand recounts are thus legal in principle but impossible in practice because of possible partiality. And in a telling aside in its judgment, the Court said that hand recounts would 'cast a cloud' over Bush's 'legitimacy' that would harm 'democratic stability'. It never crossed the five-strong conservative majority's mind that the opposite might be the case; that not counting votes which would give Gore the presidency when nationally he had won half a million more votes than Bush would damage, not democratic stability, but the entire democratic principle.</p> <p>But then right-wing America is not much interested in the democratic principle. It believes that its duty is to sustain America in its unique destiny as a Christian guardian of individual liberty, a place - I joke not - that will deserve Christ's second coming. It sees itself in a holy war against a liberal enemy within, and its uses every tool at its disposal ruthlessly to dispose of its foe.</p> <p>The Right enjoyed 12 years of power under Reagan and Bush, lost the Presidency to Clinton in 1992 when Ross Perot split the conservative vote and pledged to continue their jihad against what they saw as his illegitimate victory from the beginning. Hence the fantasies of Whitewater. Hence the Starr inquiry into the Lewinsky affair, where now we learn key evidence was fabricated. Hence the attempted impeachment. Mud sticks, they reckoned, and even though they knew impeachment would fail, they calculated it would put any Democrat presidential candidate in 2000 in a presentational bind - association with the successful Clinton years would be attacked as an association with immorality.</p> <p>But for all their efforts American public opinion remained stubbornly tolerant, sceptical of tax cuts and moderately centrist. To win Bush had to outspend his rival two to one in the last month and build on the strategic dilemma faced by Gore about the Clinton years. But even then it has taken the Supreme Court to complete the coup.</p> <p>For all the talk of reconciliation Bush is building a tribal conservative administration bent on supporting business at home and asserting US unilateralism abroad. His next Treasury Secretary has been picked not for his capacity to negotiate the US and the world through the minefield of a fragile international financial system, but his interest in feathering the nests of corporate America. And so it goes on, offering the US and the world a policy and perspective not wanted by the majority of Americans.</p> <p>The consensus view is that within months the whole Florida affair will be forgotten, and Bush will be installed as a legitimate US President. I don't agree. The value of democracies is they produce administrations broadly in tune with the times and will of the people, and thus able to marshal both consent and the correct policy responses for the varying crises that hit them.</p> <p>Not so in America. Whether the need to respect international treaties abroad or the desire to universalise medical protection at home, the US has the man in power it did not want and whose instincts are opposite to those of the majority. This will prove a disastrous administration for America and the world, and the coup will become widely understood as a moment of partisan infamy. It is a brutal lesson for us liberals.

      "bodyText": "I never thought I would live to see it. There has been a right-wing coup in the United States. It is now clear beyond any doubt that the winner of the Presidential election was Al Gore. In Florida the votes are being counted unofficially in a way the Supreme Court would not permit: he was already 140 votes ahead when counting stopped for Christmas and his final lead promises to be in the thousands. Nationally he leads by over half a million votes. What has happened is beyond outrage. It is the cynical misuse of power by a conservative \u00e9lite nakedly to serve its interests - and all of us should be frightened for the consequences. The issue is not George W. Bush's conservatism, opponent though I am of what Bush plans to do; a democracy only has vitality and political tension if its philosophy and stream of thinking is articulated and pitches to win elections. The incontrovertible abuse is that Bush has won power despite losing, and critically he only pulled off this feat because the Republicans control the Supreme Court. The Right has subverted pivotal US institutions to win power - a campaign of which the discrediting and attempted impeachment of Clinton was part - and in the process disgraced the legitimacy of US democracy at home and abroad, and undermined conceptions of the rule of law. It is a poor augury for the twenty-first century. In Britain the response has been woeful - itself a token of our own lack of hard democratic instincts. The commentary, especially in the right-of-centre press, has been to decry Gore as a poor loser and to insist that he had to accept the rules of the electoral game, respecting the votes in the US electoral college which, when Florida was lost, gave Bush the election. But as the great liberal defenders of freedom, Karl Popper and Isaiah Berlin, both argued when unjust, illegitimate governments win power through subverting the rules it is our responsibility to contest them. The nine-member Supreme Court, apart from the heady decade of the 1960s when it advanced the cause of civil rights in the South, has always been a bastion of a regressive conservatism. In the 1930s it tried to rule that key elements in Roosevelt's New Deal were unconstitutional. Its defence of the sovereignty of states rights has been fundamental in extending capital punishment and allowing bible-belt states to resist implementing federal legislation banning violence against women. Yet its general prohibition in interfering in a state's rights has been overturned in one instance; the highly politicised intervention in Florida. The more you examine it, the more outrageous the now famous judgement was. What the Court had to do to serve its political purpose was to find a way of acknowledging a sovereign state's rights and the continuing legitimacy of hand recounts in closely contested elections - after all George W. Bush had passed a law as Governor in Texas in 1998 endorsing hand recounts - but at the same time give the election to their Republican champion by finding that events in Florida were a special case.This was tricky. In the first place, even the conservative judges shared the unanimous view that it was reasonable for hand recounts to be undertaken because, as the judgment concedes: 'Punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunate number of ballots which are not punched in a clean, complete way by the voter.' Consequently individual states are obliged, when the winning margin is tight, to mount an effort to find out what the 'clear intent' of each voter was. In other words Gore was completely within his rights to demand the hand recount. The five conservatives had a problem. How could they deliver the coup? The solution was elegant. The process was too subjective, said the Supreme Court, unless the Florida court put in place even more protective measures to ensure impartiality than the Florida legislature had provided for - a position that is constitutionally impossible, as the judges knew, because it meant the Court would have to change rather than interpret Florida law. Hand recounts are thus legal in principle but impossible in practice because of possible partiality. And in a telling aside in its judgment, the Court said that hand recounts would 'cast a cloud' over Bush's 'legitimacy' that would harm 'democratic stability'. It never crossed the five-strong conservative majority's mind that the opposite might be the case; that not counting votes which would give Gore the presidency when nationally he had won half a million more votes than Bush would damage, not democratic stability, but the entire democratic principle. But then right-wing America is not much interested in the democratic principle. It believes that its duty is to sustain America in its unique destiny as a Christian guardian of individual liberty, a place - I joke not - that will deserve Christ's second coming. It sees itself in a holy war against a liberal enemy within, and its uses every tool at its disposal ruthlessly to dispose of its foe. The Right enjoyed 12 years of power under Reagan and Bush, lost the Presidency to Clinton in 1992 when Ross Perot split the conservative vote and pledged to continue their jihad against what they saw as his illegitimate victory from the beginning. Hence the fantasies of Whitewater. Hence the Starr inquiry into the Lewinsky affair, where now we learn key evidence was fabricated. Hence the attempted impeachment. Mud sticks, they reckoned, and even though they knew impeachment would fail, they calculated it would put any Democrat presidential candidate in 2000 in a presentational bind - association with the successful Clinton years would be attacked as an association with immorality. But for all their efforts American public opinion remained stubbornly tolerant, sceptical of tax cuts and moderately centrist. To win Bush had to outspend his rival two to one in the last month and build on the strategic dilemma faced by Gore about the Clinton years. But even then it has taken the Supreme Court to complete the coup. For all the talk of reconciliation Bush is building a tribal conservative administration bent on supporting business at home and asserting US unilateralism abroad. His next Treasury Secretary has been picked not for his capacity to negotiate the US and the world through the minefield of a fragile international financial system, but his interest in feathering the nests of corporate America. And so it goes on, offering the US and the world a policy and perspective not wanted by the majority of Americans. The consensus view is that within months the whole Florida affair will be forgotten, and Bush will be installed as a legitimate US President. I don't agree. The value of democracies is they produce administrations broadly in tune with the times and will of the people, and thus able to marshal both consent and the correct policy responses for the varying crises that hit them. Not so in America. Whether the need to respect international treaties abroad or the desire to universalise medical protection at home, the US has the man in power it did not want and whose instincts are opposite to those of the majority. This will prove a disastrous administration for America and the world, and the coup will become widely understood as a moment of partisan infamy. It is a brutal lesson for us liberals. Never, never forget the treachery and poison on the Right.",

The women started buying their own houses and setting up their own businesses, and the men faded into the background.</p> <p>But the arrival of crack changed the rules of the game. Streetworkers began courting dealers - usually men - who could provide them with the drug, and it didn't take these men long to realise that, once the women were addicted and in debt, they could exert control over them.</p> <p>'You can get a young girl for \u00a32,500 from South Africa,' Carlos said, 'but the two I have at the moment cost just \u00a3800 each. They come from a deprived area in black South Africa, say they're 14 but I have my doubts - I think they're younger,' he said, pulling his cap down over his eyes and leaning back comfortably in his seat. 'They're going home in a couple of months because they've made so much money. I've been sending between \u00a3500 to \u00a3700 back to their families each week. It's a two-way deal: they help me, and I help them.'</p> <p>Buying foreign children and arranging their illegal passage into the country is simple for aspiring pimps, he said. 'You give the money to the courier and they arrange it all. They get the girl from her village to your door, and then she's all yours. You don't get much choice, it's true: you ask for someone young, and she turns up. If you're lucky, she might be pretty. Sometimes she's ugly, and that's what you're stuck with.'</p> <p>The girls who arrive on his doorstep leave their right to respect and choice at home, Carlos maintains. 'They're not even property: they're commodities,' he said. 'You never use force on an English girl, no matter how young she is, because she can run away or tell the police. But the foreign girls are yours: you've bought them and they have to do what you tell them.'</p> <p>There are five girls working in Carlos's brothel off Brixton Hill, renting the rooms for \u00a350 a night and depending on him to bring them crack while they work. 'We get them addicted to drugs as soon as we can because they're more docile that way,' he said. 'It's like a fishing line: you just reel them in. A good pimp will have them acting like robots by the end of the programming, which can take weeks or months, depending on how weak the girl is. They end up like cattle - you just order them around.</p> <p>'My first bordello - I love that word - was in Dumbarton Court, off Brixton Hill,' he added. 'That's where I realised what a fortune there was to be made selling under-age girls. You can charge anything from \u00a3100 to \u00a3250 an hour, and even more for the foreign ones. It's particularly good working with the foreign girls because on top of everything else, I can charge what I like for the drugs I bring them. They don't know what's going on: I can tell them whatever I like.'</p> <p>Iowa, a 24-year-old security guard from south London, lives in another local brothel that deals with foreign girls. He takes telephone bookings from punters and helps deal with them when they arrive. 'We call the paedophiles bacon because they're pigs,' he said. 'They're usually white, middle-class professional men who like the freshness of foreign children. They think they're unsoiled.'</p> <p>This attraction doesn't last long, he admits. 'Three months on the streets for any young girl and she's not young any more,' he said. 'If you look at all those prostitutes, most are really good-looking girls, but they've been battered. Their faces have been kicked in, they don't wash and they have filthy drug habits. The young foreigners are the quickest to disintegrate: they don't even use condoms because they don't know about them. They can't go to the outreach workers for help and advice because they know that if the workers see them, they'll take them straight to the social services or to the police.'</p> <p>The one thing that will never change about the market place, Iowa believes, is the punter's search for the virgin prostitute. 'That's one of the reasons they like them as young as possible,' he said. 'They ask me for virgins and I lie - and charge them \u00a3500 for the privilege. I suppose there's some idea that the foreign children are more innocent and therefore more likely to be virgins.'</p> <p>Carlos knows his new line of trade would make him a pariah in his parents' society. 'I don't give a shit,' he said. 'If I start giving a shit, I would end up being a social worker. I have morals, but they get pushed out of the window. It's not for me to judge and anyway, if it wasn't me in this business, it would be someone else. At least I treat them with humanity,' he added. 'I know it's a funny thing to say but with me, they get looked after: I clothe them and give them protection. At the end of the day, I'm not forcing anyone to do anything: 80 per cent of these children know what they're coming into this country to do.'</p> <p>He argues that the police have absolved themselves of their duty to protect the local prostitutes: 'There's no rape suite for prostitutes,' he said. In the absence of police back-up, he says, the girls have no choice but to turn to their own. 'If there weren't people like me around, a lot of those girls would be killed because there are some extremely nasty punters. I don't see myself as a pimp: I'm a personal manager.'</p> <p>Father Shay Cullen, founder of Preda, the non-governmental organisation nominated for the 2001 Nobel Prize for its work combating the trafficking of children around the world, has watched as the power of pimps across the world has flourished alongside the trade in trafficking.</p> <p>'It's terrifying,' he said. 'Local pimps are no longer local: they're all realising the benefits to be had by linking forces with trafficking groups around the world who have the power and wealth to corrupt politicians and get more or less whatever they want.</p> <p>'In the 30 years I've been involved in this area, I've never seen pimps throughout the world so emboldened, confident and so damn clever.' <br><br><a href=\"mailto:amelia.hill@observer.co.uk\">amelia.hill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

I have morals, but they get pushed out of the window. It's not for me to judge and anyway, if it wasn't me in this business, it would be someone else. At least I treat them with humanity,' he added. 'I know it's a funny thing to say but with me, they get looked after: I clothe them and give them protection. At the end of the day, I'm not forcing anyone to do anything: 80 per cent of these children know what they're coming into this country to do.' He argues that the police have absolved themselves of their duty to protect the local prostitutes: 'There's no rape suite for prostitutes,' he said. In the absence of police back-up, he says, the girls have no choice but to turn to their own. 'If there weren't people like me around, a lot of those girls would be killed because there are some extremely nasty punters. I don't see myself as a pimp: I'm a personal manager.' Father Shay Cullen, founder of Preda, the non-governmental organisation nominated for the 2001 Nobel Prize for its work combating the trafficking of children around the world, has watched as the power of pimps across the world has flourished alongside the trade in trafficking. 'It's terrifying,' he said. 'Local pimps are no longer local: they're all realising the benefits to be had by linking forces with trafficking groups around the world who have the power and wealth to corrupt politicians and get more or less whatever they want. 'In the 30 years I've been involved in this area, I've never seen pimps throughout the world so emboldened, confident and so damn clever.' amelia.hill@observer.co.uk",

If he is not satisfied with the answers he has pledged to launch a legal challenge.. Branson said: 'The dilemma is, do we bow out gracefully, or do we fight? We certainly haven't decided [on legal action] but we want a bloody good explanation and would like somebody to convince us that they know what the hell they are talking about.' In a letter to Burns, former Permanent Secretary at the Treasury, Branson said that four months ago the commission agreed that he had a robust and credible bid. The letter asks how the commission reached a second, 'diametrically opposed' decision last week. 'Neither side were allowed to change the fundamentals of their bids,' Branson said, referring to the re-opening of the bidding process in September following the successful legal challenge by Camelot against the original decision to award the Lottery to the People's Lottery. Concern is now growing that if Branson launches a second legal challenge it could jeopardise the smooth handover of the Lottery next autumn. For every day that the Lottery did not operate, \u00a34 million would be lost to good causes. Branson said that the decision to award the new Lottery licence to Camelot sent a very negative message to the country's innovators which would eventually lead to a decline in economic performance and poorer public services. 'You've got to have a country where people are willing to take risks,' Branson said. 'It is far, far tougher to be an entrepreneur here than it is in America.'",

Joseph Roth's Foreword is pugnacious, listing those by whom 'this book does not want to be read', among them those who want to distance themselves from their embarrassing forefathers, and 'objective' readers who, 'out of sheer humanity, are struck with pity at inadequate sewage systems, and whose fear of contagion leads them to lock up poor immigrants in tenements where social problems are solved by simple epidemics'.</p> <p>His journalism is usually impressionistic, though it breaks out occasionally, as the translator drily remarks in his Preface, into 'anxiety and statistics'. This, for instance, is from his description of the Jewish quarter of Odessa: 'The evening there is a curse, the rising moon a mockery. A thick fog presses down like a condemnation behind each window, which also serves as a door, is the workshop; behind that is the bed. Over the bed are the children, suspended in bassinets, which misery rocks to and fro.' An evocation of Yom Kippur uses a similarly literary register: 'Heavy tears trickle down their old beards, and their hunger is taken away by so much pain in their souls and by the immemorial melodies that fill their ecstatic ears.'</p> <p>Roth's gift of phrasing, which can switch without warning from lyrical sentiment to irony, never deserts him, but the clarity, though intense, is local. It would be unreasonable to expect a responsible commentator to be satisfied with any one of the options open to European Jews at the time - assimilation, emigration, Zionism - but in different parts of the book Roth seems to be on both sides of every question.</p> <p> Assimilation is a form of cultural suicide, given the 'deadly, antiseptic boredom' of Western civilisation. Jews newly arrived in the West, who compromised their traditions, 'gave themselves up. They lost themselves. They shed their aura of sad beauty. Instead, a dust-grey layer of suffering without meaning and anxiety without tragedy settled on their stooped backs'. Sometimes, he seems doctrinaire as well as simply unsympathetic - 'The assimilation of a people always begins with the women'. For Jews who have so identified themselves with their country of residence as to fight and die in wars he reserves his harshest verdict: 'I blame them for it.'</p> <p> Zionism, though, is no sort of answer, already in its way a byproduct of assimilation since nationality is a Western invention. Roth more or less treats nationhood as an aspect of their history that Jews have overcome. Way back in the past, they defended their borders, conquered cities, crowned kings and paid them taxes. Why regress, when nations invariably have 'vested interests that insist on sacrifices'? By defining the essence of Jewish experience as he does, Roth is able to engineer a superb paradox, that any future Palestine might be a sovereign nation - 'but it wouldn't have any Jews in it'.</p> <p>As for emigration, it can't be considered separately from the question 'where to?', and Roth is unconvinced by any destination. He pictures emigrants to America languishing behind bars on Ellis Island in an interminable quarantine, dreaming that their children will become 'kings of some mineral or manufactured substance'. He has more faith in the good intentions of Soviet Russia (a faith nervously reasserted in his preface to the new edition of 1937). But even there, the best-case scenario is only assimilation into minority nation status. Though as an ideologue of the Left he can salute the freeing of the victim from his torments and the bully from his compulsion, he is still attached in some way to hardly compatible religious ideas of 'the divine grace of suffering'.</p> <p>The strangest thing about The Wandering Jews, as Hoffman acknowledges, is that Roth nowhere identifies himself as Jewish. When he says 'we' or 'us', he means Western Europeans, indeed Germans, and it's hard to describe this as anything but assimilation. The cultural law that Jewish jokes can legitimately be told only by self-identified Jews seems to govern passages where the irony is hard to assess, like his jaunty tribute to the heroism of Jews who chose to mutilate themselves rather than serve in the Great War. The book is full of passages that seem close to contempt: 'The Eastern Jew is afraid of ships. He doesn't trust them.' 'Jews are easily moved - I knew that. But I didn't know they could be moved by homesickness.' If his intention was to avoid special pleading, then it is an admirable one, but the effect is still highly unsettling. No doubt our modern commentaries are vitiated by a debased politics of personal authenticity. But the combination of passion and the third person will always stir echoes of the rhetoric of hatred, even when the intention is quite opposite: to create a rhetoric of love.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Nabokov's Blues</strong></p> <p> Kurt Johnson &amp; Steve Coates</p> <p>Zoland Books \u00a318.99, pp372<br></p> <p>'The more things we know, the better equipped we are to understand any one thing and it is a burning pity that our lives are not long enough and not sufficiently free of annoying obstacles, to study all things with the same care and depth,' said Vladimir Nabokov to his literature students in 1946. At this time, Nabokov was one of the best-known Russian writers in the world, but his great works in English were as yet unwritten. He still harboured ambitions of success in another field: lepidoptery - the study of butterflies. While he became perhaps the first modern literary celebrity after the publication of Lolita in 1958, scientific recognition always eluded him.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Nabokov's biographer, Brian Boyd, brought out a selection of Nabokov's lepidopteral writings, both fictional and scientific, fittingly entitled Nabokov's Butterflies, its cover adorned with a charming photograph of a be-shorted Nabokov, net grasped firmly in hand, and the fixed glare of the collector in his eyes.</p> <p> Nabokov's Blues - the Scientific Odyssey of a Literary Genius also deals with Nabokov's interest in butterflies, but in a different way.</p> <p> While Boyd and his co-editor, Robert Michael Pyle, collected and collated any reference to butterflies in Nabokov's work, Kurt Johnson (a lepidopterist) and Steve Coates (a journalist) have made his posthumous entrance into scientific history into a lucid, wide-ranging narrative that illuminates not just Nabokov's life and his interest in butterflies but also why their study is so important to science and conservation efforts, and how his contribution to lepidoptery, almost unnoticed until the past few years, is now seen as of fundamental scientific importance. All through his life, Nabokov held that he would have been as happy, if not happier, as an entomologist as he was as a novelist. 'I want no other fame [but] the immortality of this red label on a little butterfly,' he wrote in 1942, during his tenure at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, years which he described as 'the most thrilling in all my adult life'.</p> <p>Nabokov was both a 'joyfully promiscuous' collector of butterflies and moths and a serious scientist, whose specialisation was a genus of butterfly commonly known as the Blues. In the 1990s, three scientists went to South America to study the species Nabokov had examined in his groundbreaking but largely ignored 1945 article, 'Notes on Neotropical Plebejinae'. (One of the reasons Johnson and Coates posit for this oversight is that his scientific works were unreadably dense.)</p> <p> Their findings showed Nabokov's ideas about classification to be more accurate than the ones previously used, and they named an infratribe (several related genuses) based on his ideas Nabokovina. In addition to this, they also discovered many new species of Blue which they named using Nabokovian themes. In Peru and Chile there are Blues called Lolita, Kinbote and Pnin. Nabokov might well have been more pleased about this than about any of his other achievements.</p> <p>'My desire for it was one of the most intense I have ever experienced,' said Nabokov of a butterfly he saw when he was six. Lepidoptery is a passion as consuming for the amateur as for the expert, but it takes a professional to explain it to the uninitiated. Johnson and Coates beautifully describe the appeal of Nabokov's chosen genus, the Blues, with their understated beauty. 'They are, perhaps, an acquired taste but one well worth acquiring.'

      "bodyText": "Nabokov's Blues Kurt Johnson &amp; Steve Coates Zoland Books \u00a318.99, pp372 'The more things we know, the better equipped we are to understand any one thing and it is a burning pity that our lives are not long enough and not sufficiently free of annoying obstacles, to study all things with the same care and depth,' said Vladimir Nabokov to his literature students in 1946. At this time, Nabokov was one of the best-known Russian writers in the world, but his great works in English were as yet unwritten. He still harboured ambitions of success in another field: lepidoptery - the study of butterflies. While he became perhaps the first modern literary celebrity after the publication of Lolita in 1958, scientific recognition always eluded him. Earlier this year, Nabokov's biographer, Brian Boyd, brought out a selection of Nabokov's lepidopteral writings, both fictional and scientific, fittingly entitled Nabokov's Butterflies, its cover adorned with a charming photograph of a be-shorted Nabokov, net grasped firmly in hand, and the fixed glare of the collector in his eyes. Nabokov's Blues - the Scientific Odyssey of a Literary Genius also deals with Nabokov's interest in butterflies, but in a different way. While Boyd and his co-editor, Robert Michael Pyle, collected and collated any reference to butterflies in Nabokov's work, Kurt Johnson (a lepidopterist) and Steve Coates (a journalist) have made his posthumous entrance into scientific history into a lucid, wide-ranging narrative that illuminates not just Nabokov's life and his interest in butterflies but also why their study is so important to science and conservation efforts, and how his contribution to lepidoptery, almost unnoticed until the past few years, is now seen as of fundamental scientific importance. All through his life, Nabokov held that he would have been as happy, if not happier, as an entomologist as he was as a novelist. 'I want no other fame [but] the immortality of this red label on a little butterfly,' he wrote in 1942, during his tenure at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, years which he described as 'the most thrilling in all my adult life'. Nabokov was both a 'joyfully promiscuous' collector of butterflies and moths and a serious scientist, whose specialisation was a genus of butterfly commonly known as the Blues. In the 1990s, three scientists went to South America to study the species Nabokov had examined in his groundbreaking but largely ignored 1945 article, 'Notes on Neotropical Plebejinae'. (One of the reasons Johnson and Coates posit for this oversight is that his scientific works were unreadably dense.) Their findings showed Nabokov's ideas about classification to be more accurate than the ones previously used, and they named an infratribe (several related genuses) based on his ideas Nabokovina. In addition to this, they also discovered many new species of Blue which they named using Nabokovian themes. In Peru and Chile there are Blues called Lolita, Kinbote and Pnin. Nabokov might well have been more pleased about this than about any of his other achievements. 'My desire for it was one of the most intense I have ever experienced,' said Nabokov of a butterfly he saw when he was six. Lepidoptery is a passion as consuming for the amateur as for the expert, but it takes a professional to explain it to the uninitiated. Johnson and Coates beautifully describe the appeal of Nabokov's chosen genus, the Blues, with their understated beauty. 'They are, perhaps, an acquired taste but one well worth acquiring.' It is typical of Nabokov to choose butterflies which appear ordinary but in which he was able to see extraordinary things. Rarely is the connection between art and science, portrayed since the famous debate between Keats and Newton as incompatible, as lucidly encapsulated as in the work of Nabokov. He loved the merging of 'the precision of poetry and the excitement of pure science. I cannot separate the aesthetic pleasure of seeing a butterfly and the scientific pleasure of knowing what it is'. Nabokov's Blues is interesting partly because of this unusual blend of scientific rigour (thankfully diluted enough for the lay reader) and literary passion, partly because of the verve and enthusiasm with which Johnson and Coates recount their story, and partly because anything by or about Nabokov is worth reading. One of the ways in which we define a great artist is that his work, though varied and variable, is instantly recognisable as his own. Perhaps the greatest of Nabokov's hallmarks, those 'little gems of discovery' he hid in his work for careful readers, which make his books so exciting to read and reread, is his love of moths and butterflies. It would be a slight to Nabokov's Blues to suggest that enhancing an understanding of his fiction is the best reason to read it; it is such a rich discussion of the discipline of collecting, the urgent need to name new species before we enter a new era of extinction, and the importance of biodiversity for the world's survival, but this has to be as good a reason as any.",

Nothing makes people in strife feel more helpless than having no one to blame. The late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries in western Europe were 'times rich in demons'. And the possession at Loudun, a provincial town in France - in which Father Urbain Crandier was convicted of sorcery and burnt for his demonic possession of the Ursuline nuns - has always been seen as the emblematic drama of the period. The sinister, charismatic priest, the convulsed, irreverent female bodies and a supporting cast of exorcists, doctors and lawyers make what is called History unusually vivid; serious, spectacular and pornographic. Aldous Huxley wrote a compelling novel about the drama at Loudun and Ken Russell made a luridly kitsch film about it. Rather than further dramatise it, Michel de Certeau, in this remarkable book, anatomises the events as though they were a kind of secular revelation; a theatre of excess that in patient retrospect - by putting together a variety of documents and contemporary accounts - can be seen as one of those signs of the times that are signs for our times too. People in the grip of belief, people prepared to kill for ideas are not, after all, a thing of the past. Strange behaviour, de Certeau suggests, is always an opportunity for people to contest their explanations. Whatever is odd and disturbing prompts people into being persuasive. In short, it was not so much a question of curing the possessed of Loudun as of professional people - lawyers, doctors, priests and the judiciary - trying frantically to restore the public prestige of their knowledge. What was at stake, de Certeau makes clear, was not the well being of a few 'mad' nuns, but the fabric of belief, of vested interest, that underpinned the culture. The nuns, not unlike the so-called mentally ill today, were 'used to reclaim possession of the true'. The possessed women - whom de Certeau subtly sees as proto-feminists - had to be 'brought back into the linguistic arena of the debate'. And this involved each of the (male) professions involved 'making the perceived work in favour of a hidden meaning'. Faced with the bizarre behaviour of the nuns, their blasphemous blurtings and physical violence, each of the authorities had to find a convincing description of what was going on. And this could be done only by making a claim for hidden causes. People become powerful in modern cultures by assuming a unique knowledge of hidden causes. If in 1634, de Certeau argues, it is not acknowledged to be the devil who has possessed these nuns, through the medium of a diabolic sorcerer, then the culture is threatened by atheism. The paradox de Certeau reveals is that the culture desperately needed the nuns to be possessed by the devil and for the traditional religious cure of exorcism to work. If there was no devil there was no God. And once they are both out of the way the question of what might be possessing these women - of what they might be saying and on whose behalf - becomes far more troubling. Once you start believing that unacceptable people have something important to say the world is turned upside down. 'The need for certainty,' de Certeau writes with shrewd calm, 'is also the admission of the fear of losing it.' As religious authority in Europe was being contaminated by secular authority, the whole notion of certainty, of what (or in whom) it was reliable to believe, became enigmatic. People were free to be curious about themselves and the political and natural worlds they inhabited. But the spectacle of the possession at Loudun takes on, de Certeau says, 'an ambiguous meaning as a result. Like so many figures of baroque art, \"curiosity\" is ambivalent: festive in one of its facets, it also has the face of anxiety'. This book cannot help but temper and intrigue our curiosity about the spectacle of modern life. And make us wonder why the exorcist and the scapegoat dominate our imaginations. As though without them we would be at a loss.</p>",

People in the grip of belief, people prepared to kill for ideas are not, after all, a thing of the past. Strange behaviour, de Certeau suggests, is always an opportunity for people to contest their explanations. Whatever is odd and disturbing prompts people into being persuasive. In short, it was not so much a question of curing the possessed of Loudun as of professional people - lawyers, doctors, priests and the judiciary - trying frantically to restore the public prestige of their knowledge. What was at stake, de Certeau makes clear, was not the well being of a few 'mad' nuns, but the fabric of belief, of vested interest, that underpinned the culture. The nuns, not unlike the so-called mentally ill today, were 'used to reclaim possession of the true'. The possessed women - whom de Certeau subtly sees as proto-feminists - had to be 'brought back into the linguistic arena of the debate'. And this involved each of the (male) professions involved 'making the perceived work in favour of a hidden meaning'. Faced with the bizarre behaviour of the nuns, their blasphemous blurtings and physical violence, each of the authorities had to find a convincing description of what was going on. And this could be done only by making a claim for hidden causes. People become powerful in modern cultures by assuming a unique knowledge of hidden causes. If in 1634, de Certeau argues, it is not acknowledged to be the devil who has possessed these nuns, through the medium of a diabolic sorcerer, then the culture is threatened by atheism. The paradox de Certeau reveals is that the culture desperately needed the nuns to be possessed by the devil and for the traditional religious cure of exorcism to work. If there was no devil there was no God. And once they are both out of the way the question of what might be possessing these women - of what they might be saying and on whose behalf - becomes far more troubling. Once you start believing that unacceptable people have something important to say the world is turned upside down. 'The need for certainty,' de Certeau writes with shrewd calm, 'is also the admission of the fear of losing it.' As religious authority in Europe was being contaminated by secular authority, the whole notion of certainty, of what (or in whom) it was reliable to believe, became enigmatic. People were free to be curious about themselves and the political and natural worlds they inhabited. But the spectacle of the possession at Loudun takes on, de Certeau says, 'an ambiguous meaning as a result. Like so many figures of baroque art, \"curiosity\" is ambivalent: festive in one of its facets, it also has the face of anxiety'. This book cannot help but temper and intrigue our curiosity about the spectacle of modern life. And make us wonder why the exorcist and the scapegoat dominate our imaginations. As though without them we would be at a loss.",

      "body": "<p>It is one of the most romantic legends in mountaineering - the story of how a young Sherpa named Tenzing Norgay tended his father's yak herds on a high mountain pass below Everest before becoming, with Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to reach its summit in 1953.</p> <p>But while Hillary and the expedition's leader Lord Hunt both believed the Sherpa had been born in a remote mountain village in Nepal, a new book by American mountaineer Ed Webster claims that not only was Tenzing born in Tibet, but he spent much of his childhood there. The world's most famous Sherpa was not really a Sherpa at all.</p> <p>Even after Tenzing's death in 1986, the truth was considered too sensitive to disclose, not least for fear of embarrassing the Indian government which had supported Tenzing after his ascent. It would have handed a propaganda coup to the Chinese authorities in the Tibetan capital Lhasa that a 'Chinese climber' was the first to climb Everest. But now Webster has been given permission by the family to reveal the truth about Tenzing's real origins.</p> <p>Throughout his life, Tenzing remained vague about his background. In his autobiography, Tiger of the Snows, he obscured the truth of his childhood without quite denying it, telling ghostwriter James Ramsey Ullman he grew up in the village of Thame, in Nepal. In fact, his parents migrated there during the early 1920s after a period of financial hardship and debt to a local Tibetan governor.</p> <p>Tenzing, however, was more forthcoming about his birthplace, saying: 'I was born in a place called Tsa-chu, near the great mountain of Makalu, and only a day's march from Everest.' Tenzing also explains that when he was born, his mother had been on a pilgrimage to the nearby monastery at Ghang La, the name of Tenzing's house in Darjeeling.</p> <p>When Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953 he was hailed by the Nepali government in Kathmandu as a local hero who happened to live in India. Nepal's fledgling constitutional monarchy feared political domination by the new Indian republic and both countries saw great propaganda value in claiming Tenzing, the first humble-born Asian of the modern era to achieve global fame, as their own.</p> <p>Tenzing's caution about revealing his true origins was partly explained by this political wrangling. 'After we climbed Everest,' Hillary said, 'and Tenzing was invited to England, we were really in a jam because Tenzing had no passport.' The crisis was averted only when the Indian Prime Minister Pandit Nehru stepped in and personally ensured Tenzing received an Indian passport - something for which the Nepalese authorities never forgave him. Nehru became Tenzing's patron and authorised the establishment of a mountaineering school in Darjeeling, which Tenzing helped to run. To avoid political embarrassment, Tenzing described himself as 'born in the womb of Nepal and raised in the lap of India,' but that was far from the whole story.</p> <p>Now the full story has been revealed in Webster's Snow in the Kingdom, which describes an expedition in 1988 to the rarely visited East Face of Everest which approaches the mountain through the Tibetan Kharta Valley where Tenzing's home village of Moyun is located.</p> <p>Included in the team was Tenzing's oldest surviving son, Norbu, who was born in the Sherpa community at Darjeeling in India where his father had started his career as a climber after migrating there in the early 1930s.</p> <p>Norbu, like most Sherpas, knew all about his father's secret and, while in Tibet, he was able to meet long-lost relatives, including Tenzing's half-brother Tashi, and also to solve the riddle of Tenzing's birthplace.</p> <p>'If Tenzing had come out with the truth that he was, in fact, a Tibetan, he would only have magnified his nationality problems, greatly disappointing India where he then lived,' Webster told The Observer. 'It's possible some Sherpas might have ridiculed him as something of an imposter, and as a social and cultural inferior.' All of Tenzing's three wives were Sherpas and he remains a potent hero in Darjeeling and the Khumbu.</p> <p>'I believe Tenzing was a sensitive and a sincere man,' says Webster. 'His writings make this clear, so Tenzing never lied outright about his family origins - but he never told the full truth either. Perhaps he believed he was simply a mountaineer, and nationality didn't matter.'</p> <p>During the expedition in 1988, Webster identified the monastery at Ghang La as Namdag Lhe Phodang - the 'pure god's palace' - high in the Kama Valley of Tibet. The region is very sacred to Tibetan Buddhists, regarded as a 'heavenly refuge' in times of war and famine. Tsa-chu, or more accurately Tshechu, is another holy site in a remote side-valley not far from Ghang La. The yak pastures around the monastery command a superb view of Everest and are almost certainly where Tenzing spent his childhood summers. Both the family house and the monastery were destroyed following the Chinese invasion in 1950.</p> <p>Ironically, the Sherpa people originated in Kham in eastern Tibet, more than 1,000 miles from Everest, and migrated to Nepal in the sixteenth century. They still number only a few thousand in a Nepali population of 22 million but are world famous for their contribution to mountaineering.</p> <p>While the Sherpa homeland is considered to be the Solu-Khumbu region of Nepal south of Everest, the Sherpas have always had strong cultural and economic links with Tibetans across the border. Tenzing's cousin, a famous reincarnate lama called Ngwang Tenzin Norbu, founded monasteries at Rongbuk on the Tibetan side, and at Tengpoche on the Nepali side. Tenzing Norgay's cousin also gave him his name, which means 'fortunate supporter of religion'.</p> <p>The tradition of mountaineers hiring Sherpas began in Darjeeling at the start of the twentieth century; the hill men quickly proved the most reliable and physically capable porters. The best Sherpas were termed 'Tigers' and awarded medals. Mountain tourism proved lucrative and more migrated from the Everest region to India. Until 1949, Nepal remained closed to almost all Europeans.</p> <p>For Tenzing, whose parents were struggling to make a new life for themselves in the Khumbu, Darjeeling offered a chance for economic success, but his early years there were plagued by money problems as he sought to make his mark as a porter for Western mountaineers. Tenzing never saw his father again, and didn't return to the Khumbu to see his mother until 1952. When news of his sudden fame reached his homeland in Tibet, he was overwhelmed by 'all sorts of relatives I had never seen or heard of before'.</p> <p>Now, Sherpas earn thousands of dollars a year helping Western clients on Everest but, with the opening of Nepal to tourism, they no longer migrate to Darjeeling to look for work. Many Sherpas have become wealthy in a country where per capita income is $200 a year. The influx of tourists to the region Tenzing helped make famous has caused environmental problems, but has also helped alleviate the economic hardship caused by the Chinese occupation of Tibet.</p> <p>After the invasion of Tibet in 1950, China also claimed sovereignty of the Khumbu region of Nepal, which it saw as ethnically Tibetan.They mounted a number of Sino-Tibetan expeditions to Everest following the occupation for their propaganda value and still control access to the mountain. Kate Saunders of the Tibet Information Network told The Observer: 'The Chinese will understand very well the propaganda value of Tenzing's birth. They have never wasted an opportunity to stress Chinese sovereignty in Tibet.'</p> <p>Perhaps Webster's most intriguing claim is that the seven-year-old Tenzing Norgay may have met George Mallory, who disappeared on Everest in 1924 and whose body was discovered last year.

McKay's book fills those gaps, interviewing several it would be interesting to see writing if Limerick were to produce a second volume, men like Ken Maginnis, the Unionist Party's enigmatic former Ulster Defence Regiment major, who is the Unionist most likely to appear at gatherings like history conferences at Trinity College, Dublin; former Maze Prison inmate David Ervine, of the Progressive Unionists; and Ivan Cooper, the one Protestant in the leadership of the Social Democratic and Labour Party. McKay writes vividly, with obvious fascination, occasionally letting her objectivity slip and dislike show, particularly when interviewing right-wing intellectuals like Edna Longley, professor of English Literature at Queen's University, Belfast. Northern Protestants is a powerful and readable book, but marred by an irritating use of the past tense that makes it seem as if McKay's subjects are dead.",

And at a conservative estimate, it has cost the lives of 10 French children in the past five years.</p> <p>'This so-called game has become a plague,' said Fran\u00e7oise Cochet, an industrial pharmacist from Nice and mother to Nicholas, a bright and cheerful schoolboy of 15 who was found dead in his bedroom by his younger sister, a judo belt tied round his neck, last October.</p> <p>'It is terribly dangerous, it is widespread among 12- to 15-year-olds, and most teachers and parents don't even seem to know it exists. If I'd known, I would have understood what the bruises round Nicholas' s neck meant in the weeks before he died. He would be alive today.'</p> <p>The latest mode for French teenagers is, quite literally, to dice with death. Acted out in small and furtive groups, in unsupervised corners of the playground or round the back of the gym, it involves a strangler, a willing victim and a few captivated onlookers.</p> <p>Gradually, the strangler tightens his thumbs or a strip of cloth - a scarf, tie or soft belt - around the neck of the victim standing before him. As the carotid artery is slowly compressed, the blood supply to the brain is cut off, inducing the sought-after out-of-body hallucinations, followed by the loss of consciousness.</p> <p>One of the spectators is appointed to catch the victim as he slumps to the ground, so as to prevent too obvious an injury to the head. And a carefully counted three minutes later, everyone joins in the face-slapping and water-splashing that will drag the victim out of his faint. Some get to like the experience so much they try it at home.</p> <p>'I was initiated about three years ago,' admitted Arnaud, 16, last week, two days after Vanessa, a happy-go-lucky 14-year-old schoolgirl from Colmar, strangled herself to death. Her body, too, was found by her 10-year-old brother in her bedroom, where she had gone to write her Christmas cards.</p> <p>'It was at a children's camp in Corsica,' Arnaud said. 'When I got back to school, I discovered loads of people were doing it. We do it during break usually. It's scary when someone takes longer to come round. Once a girl hit her head quite badly when she fell. We were all told off. But no one said you could die.'</p> <p>Together with Fabienne Leroy, whose son Ludovic died in similar circumstances in a Paris suburb a year ago, Fran\u00e7oise Cochet has formed a group aimed at publicising the phenomenon and the risks it involves. They say they have been contacted by hundreds of parents who have seen evidence of the game without for a moment understanding what it was - and nine who found out too late.</p> <p>'We now know for certain that at the very least, nine deaths are attributable to the game, and the likelihood is that many more have gone unrecognised,' Cochet said. 'Parents have had to accept an official verdict that happy and easy-going kids simply committed suicide.'</p> <p>Cochet and Leroy's campaign has elicited an urgent letter to all French secondary school head teachers from the Education Minister, Jack Lang, advising them of 'this exceptionally dangerous so-called game' and demanding they take steps to prevent its spread - without at the same time enhancing its appeal to teenagers.</p> <p>A leading children's judge, Jean-Pierre Rosenczveig, admitted last week he had heard of several dozen cases in which 'this idiotic and dangerous fad' had very nearly turned to tragedy. The time had come to break the law of silence surrounding the scarf game by publicising every incident, he said.</p> <p>'It's a difficult situation, because you do not want to make the game seem even more attractive to kids by stressing the insane risk involved,' he said. 'But they have to be made aware that they are playing with death - and that when you do that, you do not always win.'</p>",

'This so-called game has become a plague,' said Fran\u00e7oise Cochet, an industrial pharmacist from Nice and mother to Nicholas, a bright and cheerful schoolboy of 15 who was found dead in his bedroom by his younger sister, a judo belt tied round his neck, last October. 'It is terribly dangerous, it is widespread among 12- to 15-year-olds, and most teachers and parents don't even seem to know it exists. If I'd known, I would have understood what the bruises round Nicholas' s neck meant in the weeks before he died. He would be alive today.' The latest mode for French teenagers is, quite literally, to dice with death. Acted out in small and furtive groups, in unsupervised corners of the playground or round the back of the gym, it involves a strangler, a willing victim and a few captivated onlookers. Gradually, the strangler tightens his thumbs or a strip of cloth - a scarf, tie or soft belt - around the neck of the victim standing before him. As the carotid artery is slowly compressed, the blood supply to the brain is cut off, inducing the sought-after out-of-body hallucinations, followed by the loss of consciousness. One of the spectators is appointed to catch the victim as he slumps to the ground, so as to prevent too obvious an injury to the head. And a carefully counted three minutes later, everyone joins in the face-slapping and water-splashing that will drag the victim out of his faint. Some get to like the experience so much they try it at home. 'I was initiated about three years ago,' admitted Arnaud, 16, last week, two days after Vanessa, a happy-go-lucky 14-year-old schoolgirl from Colmar, strangled herself to death. Her body, too, was found by her 10-year-old brother in her bedroom, where she had gone to write her Christmas cards. 'It was at a children's camp in Corsica,' Arnaud said. 'When I got back to school, I discovered loads of people were doing it. We do it during break usually. It's scary when someone takes longer to come round. Once a girl hit her head quite badly when she fell. We were all told off. But no one said you could die.' Together with Fabienne Leroy, whose son Ludovic died in similar circumstances in a Paris suburb a year ago, Fran\u00e7oise Cochet has formed a group aimed at publicising the phenomenon and the risks it involves. They say they have been contacted by hundreds of parents who have seen evidence of the game without for a moment understanding what it was - and nine who found out too late. 'We now know for certain that at the very least, nine deaths are attributable to the game, and the likelihood is that many more have gone unrecognised,' Cochet said. 'Parents have had to accept an official verdict that happy and easy-going kids simply committed suicide.' Cochet and Leroy's campaign has elicited an urgent letter to all French secondary school head teachers from the Education Minister, Jack Lang, advising them of 'this exceptionally dangerous so-called game' and demanding they take steps to prevent its spread - without at the same time enhancing its appeal to teenagers. A leading children's judge, Jean-Pierre Rosenczveig, admitted last week he had heard of several dozen cases in which 'this idiotic and dangerous fad' had very nearly turned to tragedy. The time had come to break the law of silence surrounding the scarf game by publicising every incident, he said. 'It's a difficult situation, because you do not want to make the game seem even more attractive to kids by stressing the insane risk involved,' he said. 'But they have to be made aware that they are playing with death - and that when you do that, you do not always win.'",

      "byline": "Sam Taylor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Francesca Martinez walks on stage you can feel the tension in the air. Not because she is a young, attractive woman in a room full of inebriated men, but because it takes her several minutes and the help of a friend just to stand in front of the microphone. Martinez has cerebral palsy, so she walks like a drunkard and sometimes slurs her words. Stand-up comedy, then, would not have been the first choice of her careers adviser. </p> <p>Yet Martinez is, at 20, probably the fastest-rising female comic in the country - she won two major awards at the Edinburgh Festival this year - as well as an experienced television actress (she was in Grange Hill for five years) and an occasional model. Though she finds it less exciting than acting or comedy, Martinez enjoys the irony of modelling: 'That to me is the ultimate contradiction, because modelling is so superficial. Yet in photographs, my disability doesn't show.' </p> <p>Under a spotlight in a comedy club, however, it shows as starkly as it ever could. In Britain, female comics are so rare that they tend to receive a barrage of crude come-ons from the heckle brigade. But Martinez, despite her slim body, suggestive smile and long, dark curls, causes a reaction akin to mild shock. Heckles freeze in mid-air as her limbs twitch and the microphone shakes beneath her lips. </p> <p>The night I see her, she is playing a tiny dive of a club called Kool Eddie's, situated under a caf\u00e9 on London's Charing Cross Road. There are 16 people in the audience, and six of them are performing on the same bill. Martinez, whose face was, barely a month earlier, plastered over the front page of the Daily Telegraph and a colour spread in Elle magazine, is the main attraction. Before she comes on, there are a couple of misogynistic loudmouths and a chubby Asian comic whose first line is: 'Yeah, I know what you're thinking. That Sanjay [from EastEnders ] has really let himself go.' </p> <p>Martinez, thankfully, is in a different class. After the long, woozy walk to the stage, she looks at the meagre audience and says in her high, warbly voice: 'In case you're wondering, the correct term for my condition is \"sober\". When I'm pissed, I walk in a straight line.' Her act is slick and conventionally structured but commendably close to the bone, and focused almost entirely upon exploding people's preconceptions of her disability. One joke runs: 'It's hard coping with an imperfect body because you feel isolated and unattractive and you can lose all your confidence.' Pause, while audience turn pale with horror. 'That's why my ex-boyfriend now goes to the gym.' Relieved laughter and applause. </p> <p>Another brings up the subject of disabled people having sex. 'Men always ask me if I shake during sex,' she smiles. 'I tell them, \"That depends on how good you are\".' </p> <p>This is how Martinez's comedy works. It doesn't lecture, accuse or complain; rather, it plays on the fear and awkwardness that most able-bodied people feel in the presence of disability, and replaces that fear and awkwardness with something warmer and more informed. 'I know when I get up on stage that some people are scared,' she says. 'A lot of them are thinking, \"Is she going to make us feel bad?\" Most of the images people see of disability are of heartache, struggle, isolation. That creates a lot of tension, and comedy is all about the release of tension.' </p> <p>Off stage, Martinez seems even brighter and more fluent than she does on stage, where her delivery, because of the strain involved in keeping her words comprehensible, tends to sound slightly flat and automated. She is nervous at first, but soon starts overflowing with enthusiasm and a sharp intelligence, to the extent that I only manage to ask five questions in two hours. </p> <p>My first is this: how did someone who can't hold a cup of tea without spilling it end up doing a job that makes most able-bodied people go weak at the knees? It started, she explains, as research for a part in a film that her father had written, which involved the lead character doing a stand-up routine. 'It's an amazing screenplay and a very strong lead role, which was written for me. When the screenplay was taken on by a big film company, they wanted to cast Hollywood stars, so I realised I had to prove I was right for the part.' </p> <p>Her father, Alex, a novelist and screenwriter whose background is Spanish, sits with her at the interview, which takes place in a half-empty wine bar in north London. He is quiet and looks serious, but they are obviously close and at ease with each other and, despite the usual malicious rumours on the comedy circuit, he doesn't seem like a Svengali figure. His role in her career, along with Francesca's mother Christina and her younger brother Raoul, has been to ensure that Francesca went to mainstream schools all her life, that she felt loved and 'normal', that she always had a straw to drink through, and that she had the confidence to pursue her dreams. </p> <p>One thousand children are born each year in this country with cerebral palsy; most, like Francesca, suffer as a result of problems that occur during or just before birth. During her mother's protracted labour, the oxygen supply to part of Francesca's brain was cut off; it was the part of her brain that controls balance, not thought or emotion. In other words, she is not mentally retarded, though many people treat her as though she is. In fact, she was a bright child and happily unaffected by her condition until she went to an all-girls' secondary school. </p> <p>There she suffered the same kind of frustrations and sadnesses as many misfit teenagers, feeling left out and underconfident, but she did nurture her secret dreams. Her first dream was to be an actress, which came true at the age of 14, when she was cast as Rachel Burns, a disabled character whose story lines never dwelt on her disability, in Grange Hill . She acted in the school series for five years and remains grateful about its effects. 'Thousands of people recognise me from Grange Hill , and they never say, \"Oh, you're that disabled girl\". It's always, \"Hi, Rachel\".' </p> <p>You have to wonder, though, if her comedy will inspire the same kind of reaction. Clever and pointed as her jokes are, there is surely a danger that she will be seen as a one-trick pony, as a comic whose primary strength is in the uniqueness of her material rather than the quality of her writing and delivery. But Martinez is defiant about the nature of her subject matter. 'I will do that material for as long as there is tension when I step on to a stage,' she says. </p> <p>'It's true that my disability gives me something unique, but it's not having a disability that allows you to be a comedian. I would hope that in five or 10 years' time, disabled people will be able to go on stage and not even mention it. But for the moment that's not possible. As long as there is tension in the audience, it's necessary for me to deflate it.' </p> <p>I mention the Asian comic at Kool Eddie's and his 'Sanjay' gag. 'Yes, he's a friend of mine,' says Martinez with a flash of eyes, 'and I know exactly why he does that joke because it's the same reason I start with the \"sober\" joke. When society is less tense about race or disability, we'll happily drop those gags.' </p> <p>Martinez has huge hopes for 2001. Her stand-up profile is growing all the time, and she has a sitcom, co-written with her father, in development. Then there is the film, which is being produced by 'a very famous British actor', and which is expected to start shooting in the next 12 months. </p> <p>'I think it's important that I get the part,' she says, 'because then it won't be just another Daniel Day Lewis winning an award for being ugly in a wheelchair. That's already been done. I think and hope that this will be groundbreaking.' </p> <p> Francesca Martinez is appearing at King's College London on 30 January</p>",

Before she comes on, there are a couple of misogynistic loudmouths and a chubby Asian comic whose first line is: 'Yeah, I know what you're thinking. That Sanjay [from EastEnders ] has really let himself go.' Martinez, thankfully, is in a different class. After the long, woozy walk to the stage, she looks at the meagre audience and says in her high, warbly voice: 'In case you're wondering, the correct term for my condition is \"sober\". When I'm pissed, I walk in a straight line.' Her act is slick and conventionally structured but commendably close to the bone, and focused almost entirely upon exploding people's preconceptions of her disability. One joke runs: 'It's hard coping with an imperfect body because you feel isolated and unattractive and you can lose all your confidence.' Pause, while audience turn pale with horror. 'That's why my ex-boyfriend now goes to the gym.' Relieved laughter and applause. Another brings up the subject of disabled people having sex. 'Men always ask me if I shake during sex,' she smiles. 'I tell them, \"That depends on how good you are\".' This is how Martinez's comedy works. It doesn't lecture, accuse or complain; rather, it plays on the fear and awkwardness that most able-bodied people feel in the presence of disability, and replaces that fear and awkwardness with something warmer and more informed. 'I know when I get up on stage that some people are scared,' she says. 'A lot of them are thinking, \"Is she going to make us feel bad?\" Most of the images people see of disability are of heartache, struggle, isolation. That creates a lot of tension, and comedy is all about the release of tension.' Off stage, Martinez seems even brighter and more fluent than she does on stage, where her delivery, because of the strain involved in keeping her words comprehensible, tends to sound slightly flat and automated. She is nervous at first, but soon starts overflowing with enthusiasm and a sharp intelligence, to the extent that I only manage to ask five questions in two hours. My first is this: how did someone who can't hold a cup of tea without spilling it end up doing a job that makes most able-bodied people go weak at the knees? It started, she explains, as research for a part in a film that her father had written, which involved the lead character doing a stand-up routine. 'It's an amazing screenplay and a very strong lead role, which was written for me. When the screenplay was taken on by a big film company, they wanted to cast Hollywood stars, so I realised I had to prove I was right for the part.' Her father, Alex, a novelist and screenwriter whose background is Spanish, sits with her at the interview, which takes place in a half-empty wine bar in north London. He is quiet and looks serious, but they are obviously close and at ease with each other and, despite the usual malicious rumours on the comedy circuit, he doesn't seem like a Svengali figure. His role in her career, along with Francesca's mother Christina and her younger brother Raoul, has been to ensure that Francesca went to mainstream schools all her life, that she felt loved and 'normal', that she always had a straw to drink through, and that she had the confidence to pursue her dreams. One thousand children are born each year in this country with cerebral palsy; most, like Francesca, suffer as a result of problems that occur during or just before birth. During her mother's protracted labour, the oxygen supply to part of Francesca's brain was cut off; it was the part of her brain that controls balance, not thought or emotion. In other words, she is not mentally retarded, though many people treat her as though she is. In fact, she was a bright child and happily unaffected by her condition until she went to an all-girls' secondary school. There she suffered the same kind of frustrations and sadnesses as many misfit teenagers, feeling left out and underconfident, but she did nurture her secret dreams. Her first dream was to be an actress, which came true at the age of 14, when she was cast as Rachel Burns, a disabled character whose story lines never dwelt on her disability, in Grange Hill . She acted in the school series for five years and remains grateful about its effects. 'Thousands of people recognise me from Grange Hill , and they never say, \"Oh, you're that disabled girl\". It's always, \"Hi, Rachel\".' You have to wonder, though, if her comedy will inspire the same kind of reaction. Clever and pointed as her jokes are, there is surely a danger that she will be seen as a one-trick pony, as a comic whose primary strength is in the uniqueness of her material rather than the quality of her writing and delivery. But Martinez is defiant about the nature of her subject matter. 'I will do that material for as long as there is tension when I step on to a stage,' she says. 'It's true that my disability gives me something unique, but it's not having a disability that allows you to be a comedian. I would hope that in five or 10 years' time, disabled people will be able to go on stage and not even mention it. But for the moment that's not possible. As long as there is tension in the audience, it's necessary for me to deflate it.' I mention the Asian comic at Kool Eddie's and his 'Sanjay' gag. 'Yes, he's a friend of mine,' says Martinez with a flash of eyes, 'and I know exactly why he does that joke because it's the same reason I start with the \"sober\" joke. When society is less tense about race or disability, we'll happily drop those gags.' Martinez has huge hopes for 2001. Her stand-up profile is growing all the time, and she has a sitcom, co-written with her father, in development. Then there is the film, which is being produced by 'a very famous British actor', and which is expected to start shooting in the next 12 months. 'I think it's important that I get the part,' she says, 'because then it won't be just another Daniel Day Lewis winning an award for being ugly in a wheelchair. That's already been done. I think and hope that this will be groundbreaking.' Francesca Martinez is appearing at King's College London on 30 January",

It clocks in at a titanic 3 hours 12 minutes but is still an annual ratings winner.

'Whenever I go into a studio, I always operate on the principle that I might get hit by a bus tomorrow,' she said earlier this year. 'I'd hate the obituaries to read, \"And her last album was her not-very-good album\".' </p> <p> No chance of that; Tropical Brainstorm, her Latin-drenched finale, was superb. And it wasn't a London bus which cut off Kirsty MacColl's life and career in mid-sentence but a Mexican powerboat, striking her as she swam in a reserved area off the coral island of Cozumel, close to the Yucatan peninsula. She had taken her two teenage sons on holiday there after one of them had lost a close friend; to ease his loss. Instead, she added her own. </p> <p>The senseless accident that took her life was one reason why the death of Kirsty MacColl is so shocking. Early deaths in pop music usually come surrounded by caveats; drugs, drink, car accidents and plane crashes are almost occupational hazards for lives lived on the road and often at the edge. This was a 41-year-old mother who long ago put her career second to raising her kids, and who sought a life unwarped by a business she often spoke of contemptuously and which, she declared, 'gets slightly less to do with music every year'. </p> <p>That MacColl should vanish just as Christmas was unfurling added a further poignant note. Rare is the seasonal compilation that doesn't include 'Fairytale of New York', her 1987 hit with The Pogues, on which she and Shane MacGowan play a quarrelling pair of Irish immigrants in the Big Apple, MacGowan soused on nostalgia and false hope, MacColl tanning him with gritty realism. It's a perfect seasonal item, packed with regret, drink and optimism, and now tinged with tragedy. </p> <p>If 'Fairytale' confirmed MacColl's place in the public's heart, she had plenty of other claims on our affections. She may not have had many hits, but her songs, and her inspired cover versions, sank into the national psyche in a way that the chart-busters of more successful acts did not. It was a MacColl song - 'They Don't Know', written when she was 17 - that gave Tracey Ullman a number one on her way to thespian stardom. MacColl's 1987 cover of Billy Bragg's 'New England' helped bestow anthemic status on the song, and her 1989 version of 'Days' reminded a new generation of the national treasure that is Ray Davies. </p> <p> Davies was one of her influences and idols, along with Morrissey; writers of catchy, literate songs in the English kitchen-sink tradition. Her own brand of acerbic wit and social commentary was apparent from the start, when she dropped out of school in Croydon to sign up with Stiff Records, one of the bastions of the punk uprising. She had first picked up a guitar at 13 after hearing Neil Young's Harvest album. As a redheaded 17-year-old with an attitude to match her flame-coloured hair, she fitted into the feisty atmosphere of the times, though she had to wait until 1981 for a bona fide hit, with 'There's A Guy Works Down The Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis'. </p> <p> Surprisingly, given her self-confidence and forthrightness, Kirsty was dogged by stage fright, which she ascribed to 'a bad experience on my first tour. I just thought, why subject yourself to such humiliation?' She tried hypnotism, among other things, though the remedy proved to be a bout of touring with the Pogues. </p> <p> Her 1989 album, Kite, confirmed her as a songwriter of real class, albeit one who didn't fit into the stereotypes of rock chick or what Kirsty witheringly termed 'the Laura Ashley school of singer-songwriters'. Electric Landlady, two years later, followed Kite 's pattern of critical adulation and disappointing sales. She accurately summed up her songs as 'happy and melodic but with bitter, twisted lyrics - jolly little numbers with snarling attitudes'. </p> <p>Despite the protracted absences, she stayed active. She lent back-up harmonies to The Smiths, Happy Mondays and Simple Minds among others. A natural singer, she had the gift of perfect pitch, and though she declared 'there are worse things in life than being out of tune', she never was. She sang a beautiful version of 'Miss Otis Regrets' for Aids charity Red Hot's second album, and with Evan Dando a winning cover of Lou Reed's 'Perfect Day'. </p> <p>Back at the start of the 1990s, she also had her own regular spot on an early French and Saunders series. 'I look incredibly pissed off and unhappy on those programmes,' she said later. 'In fact, I was just terrified.' If she had cared to compete a little harder, been able to play the celebrity TV slots with the necessary fake gusto, Kirsty MacColl might have become more of a household name. She, however, clung to her belief that what ultimately mattered was her work. 'I've never been fashionable, which is a definite advantage when it comes to longevity. I've always just concentrated on the quality of the songs,' she told this writer back in 1994, in an interview to promote her Titanic Days album.</p> <p>It was an instructive encounter, conducted at the offices of her latest record company; since she invariably undersold their expectations, she was always hopping labels. MacColl was just what I expected: bright, funny and caustic, with a laugh like a tray of breaking crockery. When I proved less knowledgeable about her new album than she liked, she was quick to put a bluebottle in my ear about it. She was also very charming. We ended up discussing garden water features, on which subject she proved formidably informed, talking about the virtues of reed beds with an enthusiasm most stars reserve for their record collection. </p> <p> Kirsty also put me straight about my assumption that her musical gifts were some kind of ancestral heritage passed on from her father, Ewan MacColl, the pre-eminent British folk singer of the 1950s and composer of 'Dirty Old Town' and 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face' - songs that have become minor institutions in themselves. Not a bit of it, said Kirsty. Everything she knew about folk music she had learnt from The Pogues. Her father had been an almost remote figure whom she saw only at weekends. He had left her mother, the choreographer Jean Newlove, shortly after Kirsty was born, and taken up with his fellow folk singer Peggy Seeger. In any case, Ewan, a politically active Scottish Communist, regarded the pop music Kirsty loved (the Beach Boys, for example) with the contempt of the folk puritan. (It was he, for example, who led the attack on Bob Dylan for his lack of folk purity.) </p> <p>Kirsty's attitude to her famous father was ambiguous. At times she seemed almost dismissive of him, at others proud, citing his songwriting as an inspiration. 'I didn't realise it for years, but I was brought up to agitate,' she said recently. </p> <p> One of the songs on Titanic Days, 'Bad', alluded to her familial baggage. 'I've been the token woman all my life/ The token daughter and the token wife,' it started, referring not just to her father but to her husband, the record producer Steve Lillywhite, with whom she had just broken up. 'The implication is sometimes that I only went into music because certain men guided me that way,' she complained,' whereas I'd been making records for five years before I even met Steve.' Kirsty was fiercely righteous about the deal the music business hands to women, especially the idea that having a couple of children meant she had given up the creative ghost: 'I'm constantly asked, \"How do you combine a career and a family?\" They never ask my husband or Sting that question. It's plain old sexism, really.' </p> <p>The demands of motherhood must, nonetheless, have played their part in the six-year break between Titanic Days - which she referred to as her 'sad divorce album' - and this year's magnificent Tropical Brainstorm . For two years she didn't write any songs at all. 'I used to worry about writer's block, but I think this time it was God's way of saying: \"You've got nothing to write about, so shut up.\" In any case, I didn't want to make another melancholy record. That would have been grim. Instead I started to do some of the things I'd wanted to do since forever.' </p> <p>One of those things was travelling to Cuba, which she did first in 1992, and thereafter on a regular basis. MacColl, who had a Latin track on Electric Landlady and had sung on David Byrne's Rei Momo album, had liked Latin music for a long time. Her fascination stretched back to her childhood, when her father gave her an album of Mexican mariachi music. </p> <p>The young Kirsty was fascinated by the gaudy cover, the band's exotic clothes and instruments, the carnival atmosphere of the music. 'I think that's where I got it into my head that anybody who spoke Spanish was having a better time than me.' </p> <p> Once she'd visited Cuba, the Latin bug bit hard. When her Best Of compilation appeared in 1995, there was Kirsty on the cover dressed in Castro cap, lighting a fat cigar with a US dollar bill. She became a regular at Cuban Solidarity Campaign shows, and took Spanish classes. Here she met a Brazilian who became her lodger at her Ealing home, paying his rent with Portuguese lessons. Her love of Cuban music extended to Brazil, which she also visited. </p> <p> Her travels, many of them alone, fed into Tropical Brainstorm, a record which fused her songwriting with her passion for Latin music. In a more just world, she would have been back in the UK charts this summer with one of the record's highlights, 'In These Shoes', a salsa tale of lust and non-sensible footwear that was picked by Adidas for an ad campaign. The single became a hit in Europe, but not at home. Kirsty, who complained that, 'Radio 1 won't play my singles now I'm over 30', had made a documentary series on Cuban music for Radio 2, which was due to kick off last week, but which has now been deferred. </p> <p> 'I didn't want to recreate an authentic sound,' she said of Tropical Brainstorm , 'first of all cos I'm not Celia Cruz, and a lot of people like my music mostly because of the lyrics. I didn't want to try and fail at being the Buena Vista Social Club. I wanted to succeed at being Kirsty MacColl.' </p> <p> Kirsty MacColl, singer and songwriter, born 10 October 1959, died 18 December 2000.</p>",

MacColl's 1987 cover of Billy Bragg's 'New England' helped bestow anthemic status on the song, and her 1989 version of 'Days' reminded a new generation of the national treasure that is Ray Davies. Davies was one of her influences and idols, along with Morrissey; writers of catchy, literate songs in the English kitchen-sink tradition. Her own brand of acerbic wit and social commentary was apparent from the start, when she dropped out of school in Croydon to sign up with Stiff Records, one of the bastions of the punk uprising. She had first picked up a guitar at 13 after hearing Neil Young's Harvest album. As a redheaded 17-year-old with an attitude to match her flame-coloured hair, she fitted into the feisty atmosphere of the times, though she had to wait until 1981 for a bona fide hit, with 'There's A Guy Works Down The Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis'. Surprisingly, given her self-confidence and forthrightness, Kirsty was dogged by stage fright, which she ascribed to 'a bad experience on my first tour. I just thought, why subject yourself to such humiliation?' She tried hypnotism, among other things, though the remedy proved to be a bout of touring with the Pogues. Her 1989 album, Kite, confirmed her as a songwriter of real class, albeit one who didn't fit into the stereotypes of rock chick or what Kirsty witheringly termed 'the Laura Ashley school of singer-songwriters'. Electric Landlady, two years later, followed Kite 's pattern of critical adulation and disappointing sales. She accurately summed up her songs as 'happy and melodic but with bitter, twisted lyrics - jolly little numbers with snarling attitudes'. Despite the protracted absences, she stayed active. She lent back-up harmonies to The Smiths, Happy Mondays and Simple Minds among others. A natural singer, she had the gift of perfect pitch, and though she declared 'there are worse things in life than being out of tune', she never was. She sang a beautiful version of 'Miss Otis Regrets' for Aids charity Red Hot's second album, and with Evan Dando a winning cover of Lou Reed's 'Perfect Day'. Back at the start of the 1990s, she also had her own regular spot on an early French and Saunders series. 'I look incredibly pissed off and unhappy on those programmes,' she said later. 'In fact, I was just terrified.' If she had cared to compete a little harder, been able to play the celebrity TV slots with the necessary fake gusto, Kirsty MacColl might have become more of a household name. She, however, clung to her belief that what ultimately mattered was her work. 'I've never been fashionable, which is a definite advantage when it comes to longevity. I've always just concentrated on the quality of the songs,' she told this writer back in 1994, in an interview to promote her Titanic Days album. It was an instructive encounter, conducted at the offices of her latest record company; since she invariably undersold their expectations, she was always hopping labels. MacColl was just what I expected: bright, funny and caustic, with a laugh like a tray of breaking crockery. When I proved less knowledgeable about her new album than she liked, she was quick to put a bluebottle in my ear about it. She was also very charming. We ended up discussing garden water features, on which subject she proved formidably informed, talking about the virtues of reed beds with an enthusiasm most stars reserve for their record collection. Kirsty also put me straight about my assumption that her musical gifts were some kind of ancestral heritage passed on from her father, Ewan MacColl, the pre-eminent British folk singer of the 1950s and composer of 'Dirty Old Town' and 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face' - songs that have become minor institutions in themselves. Not a bit of it, said Kirsty. Everything she knew about folk music she had learnt from The Pogues. Her father had been an almost remote figure whom she saw only at weekends. He had left her mother, the choreographer Jean Newlove, shortly after Kirsty was born, and taken up with his fellow folk singer Peggy Seeger. In any case, Ewan, a politically active Scottish Communist, regarded the pop music Kirsty loved (the Beach Boys, for example) with the contempt of the folk puritan. (It was he, for example, who led the attack on Bob Dylan for his lack of folk purity.) Kirsty's attitude to her famous father was ambiguous. At times she seemed almost dismissive of him, at others proud, citing his songwriting as an inspiration. 'I didn't realise it for years, but I was brought up to agitate,' she said recently. One of the songs on Titanic Days, 'Bad', alluded to her familial baggage. 'I've been the token woman all my life/ The token daughter and the token wife,' it started, referring not just to her father but to her husband, the record producer Steve Lillywhite, with whom she had just broken up. 'The implication is sometimes that I only went into music because certain men guided me that way,' she complained,' whereas I'd been making records for five years before I even met Steve.' Kirsty was fiercely righteous about the deal the music business hands to women, especially the idea that having a couple of children meant she had given up the creative ghost: 'I'm constantly asked, \"How do you combine a career and a family?\" They never ask my husband or Sting that question. It's plain old sexism, really.' The demands of motherhood must, nonetheless, have played their part in the six-year break between Titanic Days - which she referred to as her 'sad divorce album' - and this year's magnificent Tropical Brainstorm . For two years she didn't write any songs at all. 'I used to worry about writer's block, but I think this time it was God's way of saying: \"You've got nothing to write about, so shut up.\" In any case, I didn't want to make another melancholy record. That would have been grim. Instead I started to do some of the things I'd wanted to do since forever.' One of those things was travelling to Cuba, which she did first in 1992, and thereafter on a regular basis. MacColl, who had a Latin track on Electric Landlady and had sung on David Byrne's Rei Momo album, had liked Latin music for a long time. Her fascination stretched back to her childhood, when her father gave her an album of Mexican mariachi music. The young Kirsty was fascinated by the gaudy cover, the band's exotic clothes and instruments, the carnival atmosphere of the music. 'I think that's where I got it into my head that anybody who spoke Spanish was having a better time than me.' Once she'd visited Cuba, the Latin bug bit hard. When her Best Of compilation appeared in 1995, there was Kirsty on the cover dressed in Castro cap, lighting a fat cigar with a US dollar bill. She became a regular at Cuban Solidarity Campaign shows, and took Spanish classes. Here she met a Brazilian who became her lodger at her Ealing home, paying his rent with Portuguese lessons. Her love of Cuban music extended to Brazil, which she also visited. Her travels, many of them alone, fed into Tropical Brainstorm, a record which fused her songwriting with her passion for Latin music. In a more just world, she would have been back in the UK charts this summer with one of the record's highlights, 'In These Shoes', a salsa tale of lust and non-sensible footwear that was picked by Adidas for an ad campaign. The single became a hit in Europe, but not at home. Kirsty, who complained that, 'Radio 1 won't play my singles now I'm over 30', had made a documentary series on Cuban music for Radio 2, which was due to kick off last week, but which has now been deferred. 'I didn't want to recreate an authentic sound,' she said of Tropical Brainstorm , 'first of all cos I'm not Celia Cruz, and a lot of people like my music mostly because of the lyrics. I didn't want to try and fail at being the Buena Vista Social Club. I wanted to succeed at being Kirsty MacColl.' Kirsty MacColl, singer and songwriter, born 10 October 1959, died 18 December 2000.",

It's a funny atmosphere when you arrive at the station on Christmas Day, because the people who are on duty from the night before will be waiting for us at the door. They'll go off and the day will start for us in quite a sombre mood. We'll have a buffet for lunch so people can help themselves when they want to. Coming up to 6 o'clock, you begin to think ahead to going home and having a nice glass of wine. Most people save their traditional dinner with their family for the evening, which means that everyone in the family suffers a bit as well.' <p> <b> Mick Jones, elephant keeper team leader, Chester Zoo</b> <br> 'The animals are what count and they need us to look after them, even though it's Christmas Day. I try to give them a treat. Just because I'm daft about them I'll give them a melon or a pineapple. We try to be as festive as we can while we're shovelling shit. We put on seasonal music and turn all the Christmas lights on. My friends all wait until I get home to have dinner. There's never any question. I'm the elephant keeper, and they accept what I do.' </p> <p> <b> Angelo Maresco, manager, Savoy Grill, London</b> <br> 'Years ago, Christmas really happened at home, but now more and more people go out for Christmas lunch. People work so hard and more wives work, and they don't want to spoil their day by cooking and washing up, so they come here and let us do it for them. I believe people should be at home at Christmas, but that's how it is these days.' </p> <p> <b> Rosie Stewart, student, London</b> <br> 'Living the vegan alternative lifestyle that we do, my friends and I are a little overwhelmed by the commercialism of Christmas. So we try to get back to basics and use it as a chance to see friends and enjoy each other's company. We won't do lots of shopping and buy each other presents, but just before we all go home for Christmas, we'll get together and share a big meal. We're a mixture of meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans, so we'll all pitch in and share the cooking. It'll be a case of too many cooks and it will get too much at one point, but there'll be lots of wine, so we'll have great fun. On Christmas Day, I'll be with my nan and she'll make sure that there's plenty of vegan food for me to eat.' </p> <p> <b> Stephen Green, ward manager, King's College Hospital, south London</b> <br> 'We'll get the usual admissions throughout Christmas. Along with many people who have fallen off rollerblades or other Christmas presents, there's a lot of: \"Here, Grandma, have a go on my skateboard... crunch !\" We try to keep it very light. Hospital is the last place you want to be on Christmas Day, so our nurses wear tinsel and Santa hats. The patients all have a drink - the ladies will have sherry and the gentlemen a beer. I'll pop to the off-licence to get non-alcoholic beer for anyone who is on antibiotics - it makes your day worse if you can't have a beer. We'll have a traditional Christmas dinner. It's theoretically hot, but hospital food is hospital food.' </p> <p> <b> Julie Jameson, lifetime member, Weight Watchers, Richmond</b> <br> 'I think more about the time immediately after Christmas than most people. It's easier to compromise during Christmas than to have to go to a Weight Watchers meeting in January and have 4lb or 5lb to lose. It's nice to come through the other side without that horrible feeling of nothing fitting you. I avoid buying huge boxes of chocolates and 48 mince pies, like I used to. I live next door to Twickenham rugby ground, and I think people must have thought that I was feeding the entire English team. It's much more satisfying to have more expensive things and eat just a few than to face January with all the food no one wanted calling you from the cupboards when there's nothing on television and you're really bored.' </p> <p> <b> Neil Oliver, Christmas cruise manager, P&amp;O Aurora </b> <br> 'I would never tell anyone who wants to get away from Christmas to come on a cruise because it is everywhere. Before we leave Southampton, a company that usually decorates shopping malls and department stores blitzes the ship. One lounge is a quiet room, without any of the usual Christmas entertainment. People may have bad memories of Christmas - they may have lost a loved one at this time of year, so we want to give them the option of going somewhere calm. The same goes for dinner - I'll be hosting a table that includes three or four single ladies and gentlemen. We always have a contingent of people travelling alone, so we keep our eyes open for some little old lady who may need company so she's not lonely for Christmas dinner.' </p> <p> <b> Richard Johnson, jockey, racing at Kempton Park on Boxing Day</b> <br> 'My family comes first on Christmas Day, but racing's a very close second. I definitely won't miss Christmas lunch, but I might have a smaller one - I need to be 10st for racing on Boxing Day. I'll have just one roast potato and one piece of turkey, and then a run in the afternoon and a hot bath. It's not a nice feeling if you have to miss Christmas dinner - I'm lucky because I'm quite light, but a lot of the bigger lads will have a tough time. We do this job because we love it, though, and we want to give 110 per cent on Boxing Day.' </p> <p> <b> Priti Patel, pharmacist, Brighton</b> <br> 'We're Hindu but we have celebrations on Christmas Day anyway - it's a great excuse for a family get together. The kids have picked up the traditions in school, so we're keen to keep them alive in our own way. All the women gather in the kitchen to make curry and vegetarian dishes. We have 25 people for dinner, so keeping everyone happy is a delicate balance.' </p> <p> <b> John Downie, director, Aldgate Homelessness Advice Centre, London</b> <br> 'A lot of people come to us for Christmas lunch because they need someone to talk to. We give them a welcome, a good hot meal and some company. Rather than people queuing up for their food, the tables are laid in a festive manner and people are served by our staff and volunteers. Coming to us is a major highlight in what is otherwise a barren week. Most of the people who attend like to hear Christmas music because they don't really hear it anywhere else, but there's no guarantee that we'll have money for any live entertainment. We're inundated with volunteers at this time of year. I think it gives a hint of what other people's Christmases are like. There are lots of unhappy people who don't want to be on their own on Christmas Day.' </p> <p> <b> Denis Cobell, ceremonies co-ordinator for the British Humanist Society (south-east region)</b> <br> 'The festivities associated with Christmas - feasting and exchanging presents - predate Christianity, and at one point Christians dissociated themselves from the excess. In the northern hemisphere, it's part of the winter solstice activities, a way to deal with the darkest days of the year. Romans called this time of the year Saturnalia, the return of the unconquered sun. The round pudding, set alight with alcohol, was once a solar symbol. By celebrating at this time of the year, we're keeping ancient traditions alive.' </p> <p> <b> Samantha Macmillan, cabin crew, Virgin Atlantic</b> <br> 'I have a whale of a time when I fly on Christmas Day. We all wear Santa hats, reindeer ears and lots of tinsel. We hold competitions and sing Christmas carols over the PA. We really want passengers to enjoy themselves, so staff at the boarding gate are the most dressed up. I love seeing children on board because they're so excited they really create an atmosphere. The menu on Christmas Day is easy - we go around saying, \"Would you like turkey, turkey or turkey?\" I can't wait to go to work this year.' </p> <p> <b> Phil Hogan, Observer columnist, Hertfordshire </b><br> We'll be tucking into a naff melon starter, a free-range turkey and probably a Christmas pud from Waitrose. Our four children are quite fastidious, so as usual we'll be foisting all kinds of stuff on them they don't like - sprouts, bread sauce, broccoli, stuffing, horrible crystallised fruits. I usually cook a special nut roast for our vegetarian to turn his nose up at. Everyone will love the roast spuds and little sausages and afterwards we'll open a dustbin-sized tin of Quality Street. A big tradition with us, too, is to buy a box of dates to throw away unopened some time in July.'</p> <p>\u0095 Phil Hogan returns on 7 January.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Martin Gayton, station officer, Lambeth Fire Station, London 'A few weeks before Christmas we put everybody's name in a hat and pull out the three lucky ones who'll have Christmas Day at home. It's a funny atmosphere when you arrive at the station on Christmas Day, because the people who are on duty from the night before will be waiting for us at the door. They'll go off and the day will start for us in quite a sombre mood. We'll have a buffet for lunch so people can help themselves when they want to. Coming up to 6 o'clock, you begin to think ahead to going home and having a nice glass of wine. Most people save their traditional dinner with their family for the evening, which means that everyone in the family suffers a bit as well.' Mick Jones, elephant keeper team leader, Chester Zoo 'The animals are what count and they need us to look after them, even though it's Christmas Day. I try to give them a treat. Just because I'm daft about them I'll give them a melon or a pineapple. We try to be as festive as we can while we're shovelling shit. We put on seasonal music and turn all the Christmas lights on. My friends all wait until I get home to have dinner. There's never any question. I'm the elephant keeper, and they accept what I do.' Angelo Maresco, manager, Savoy Grill, London 'Years ago, Christmas really happened at home, but now more and more people go out for Christmas lunch. People work so hard and more wives work, and they don't want to spoil their day by cooking and washing up, so they come here and let us do it for them. I believe people should be at home at Christmas, but that's how it is these days.' Rosie Stewart, student, London 'Living the vegan alternative lifestyle that we do, my friends and I are a little overwhelmed by the commercialism of Christmas. So we try to get back to basics and use it as a chance to see friends and enjoy each other's company. We won't do lots of shopping and buy each other presents, but just before we all go home for Christmas, we'll get together and share a big meal. We're a mixture of meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans, so we'll all pitch in and share the cooking. It'll be a case of too many cooks and it will get too much at one point, but there'll be lots of wine, so we'll have great fun. On Christmas Day, I'll be with my nan and she'll make sure that there's plenty of vegan food for me to eat.' Stephen Green, ward manager, King's College Hospital, south London 'We'll get the usual admissions throughout Christmas. Along with many people who have fallen off rollerblades or other Christmas presents, there's a lot of: \"Here, Grandma, have a go on my skateboard... crunch !\" We try to keep it very light. Hospital is the last place you want to be on Christmas Day, so our nurses wear tinsel and Santa hats. The patients all have a drink - the ladies will have sherry and the gentlemen a beer. I'll pop to the off-licence to get non-alcoholic beer for anyone who is on antibiotics - it makes your day worse if you can't have a beer. We'll have a traditional Christmas dinner. It's theoretically hot, but hospital food is hospital food.' Julie Jameson, lifetime member, Weight Watchers, Richmond 'I think more about the time immediately after Christmas than most people. It's easier to compromise during Christmas than to have to go to a Weight Watchers meeting in January and have 4lb or 5lb to lose. It's nice to come through the other side without that horrible feeling of nothing fitting you. I avoid buying huge boxes of chocolates and 48 mince pies, like I used to. I live next door to Twickenham rugby ground, and I think people must have thought that I was feeding the entire English team. It's much more satisfying to have more expensive things and eat just a few than to face January with all the food no one wanted calling you from the cupboards when there's nothing on television and you're really bored.' Neil Oliver, Christmas cruise manager, P&amp;O Aurora 'I would never tell anyone who wants to get away from Christmas to come on a cruise because it is everywhere. Before we leave Southampton, a company that usually decorates shopping malls and department stores blitzes the ship. One lounge is a quiet room, without any of the usual Christmas entertainment. People may have bad memories of Christmas - they may have lost a loved one at this time of year, so we want to give them the option of going somewhere calm. The same goes for dinner - I'll be hosting a table that includes three or four single ladies and gentlemen. We always have a contingent of people travelling alone, so we keep our eyes open for some little old lady who may need company so she's not lonely for Christmas dinner.' Richard Johnson, jockey, racing at Kempton Park on Boxing Day 'My family comes first on Christmas Day, but racing's a very close second. I definitely won't miss Christmas lunch, but I might have a smaller one - I need to be 10st for racing on Boxing Day. I'll have just one roast potato and one piece of turkey, and then a run in the afternoon and a hot bath. It's not a nice feeling if you have to miss Christmas dinner - I'm lucky because I'm quite light, but a lot of the bigger lads will have a tough time. We do this job because we love it, though, and we want to give 110 per cent on Boxing Day.' Priti Patel, pharmacist, Brighton 'We're Hindu but we have celebrations on Christmas Day anyway - it's a great excuse for a family get together. The kids have picked up the traditions in school, so we're keen to keep them alive in our own way. All the women gather in the kitchen to make curry and vegetarian dishes. We have 25 people for dinner, so keeping everyone happy is a delicate balance.' John Downie, director, Aldgate Homelessness Advice Centre, London 'A lot of people come to us for Christmas lunch because they need someone to talk to. We give them a welcome, a good hot meal and some company. Rather than people queuing up for their food, the tables are laid in a festive manner and people are served by our staff and volunteers. Coming to us is a major highlight in what is otherwise a barren week. Most of the people who attend like to hear Christmas music because they don't really hear it anywhere else, but there's no guarantee that we'll have money for any live entertainment. We're inundated with volunteers at this time of year. I think it gives a hint of what other people's Christmases are like. There are lots of unhappy people who don't want to be on their own on Christmas Day.' Denis Cobell, ceremonies co-ordinator for the British Humanist Society (south-east region) 'The festivities associated with Christmas - feasting and exchanging presents - predate Christianity, and at one point Christians dissociated themselves from the excess. In the northern hemisphere, it's part of the winter solstice activities, a way to deal with the darkest days of the year. Romans called this time of the year Saturnalia, the return of the unconquered sun. The round pudding, set alight with alcohol, was once a solar symbol. By celebrating at this time of the year, we're keeping ancient traditions alive.' Samantha Macmillan, cabin crew, Virgin Atlantic 'I have a whale of a time when I fly on Christmas Day. We all wear Santa hats, reindeer ears and lots of tinsel. We hold competitions and sing Christmas carols over the PA. We really want passengers to enjoy themselves, so staff at the boarding gate are the most dressed up. I love seeing children on board because they're so excited they really create an atmosphere. The menu on Christmas Day is easy - we go around saying, \"Would you like turkey, turkey or turkey?\" I can't wait to go to work this year.' Phil Hogan, Observer columnist, Hertfordshire We'll be tucking into a naff melon starter, a free-range turkey and probably a Christmas pud from Waitrose. Our four children are quite fastidious, so as usual we'll be foisting all kinds of stuff on them they don't like - sprouts, bread sauce, broccoli, stuffing, horrible crystallised fruits. I usually cook a special nut roast for our vegetarian to turn his nose up at. Everyone will love the roast spuds and little sausages and afterwards we'll open a dustbin-sized tin of Quality Street. A big tradition with us, too, is to buy a box of dates to throw away unopened some time in July.' \u0095 Phil Hogan returns on 7 January.",

This New Labour network take high incomes, live in luxury, distance themselves from deprived estates, and insist that they - not the poor - must have power. In short, they reinforce inequality. Socialism is about promoting equality by having just a modest income, by being close to the materially needy, and conceding power to the socially deprived. Is there a single one of this liberal \u00e9lite prepared to be a socialist example? <br><b>Bob Holman</b><br> Glasgow </p> <p>\u0095 Forty years ago, the British Left was concerned with economic and social justice for the mass of ordinary people. Finding this too difficult a task, the Left fell under the spell of the politics of 'gender', 'sexuality' and 'ethnicity'. The payoff for the Left was that it gained the endorsement of the so-called 'liberal \u00e9lite'. This paved the way first to a hearing in the media and then to power.

This New Labour network take high incomes, live in luxury, distance themselves from deprived estates, and insist that they - not the poor - must have power. In short, they reinforce inequality. Socialism is about promoting equality by having just a modest income, by being close to the materially needy, and conceding power to the socially deprived. Is there a single one of this liberal \u00e9lite prepared to be a socialist example? Bob Holman Glasgow \u0095 Forty years ago, the British Left was concerned with economic and social justice for the mass of ordinary people. Finding this too difficult a task, the Left fell under the spell of the politics of 'gender', 'sexuality' and 'ethnicity'. The payoff for the Left was that it gained the endorsement of the so-called 'liberal \u00e9lite'. This paved the way first to a hearing in the media and then to power. The great triumph of this alliance has been to convince so many people that making sure a few more women, homosexuals and non-whites get cosy, well paid jobs, 'at the top', is a major contribution to producing a more equitable society.

But now a stable of 15 former racehorses faces being taken to the knacker's yard because the money to pay for keeping them alive has run out. Whether they survive or suffer the same fate as Christmas turkeys depends largely on Andrew Parker Bowles, the former husband of Camilla, Prince Charles's partner. Four months ago Parker Bowles, chairman of the British Horseracing Board's benevolent fund for needy animals, pledged to provide \u00a350,000 to ensure the former mounts were cared for. Since then, though, only \u00a315,000 of the \u00a350,000 has arrived and the sanctuary looking after the horses is on the brink of having to close. The financial crisis at the Greatwood sanctuary in Okehampton, Devon, is so severe that Michael and Helen Yeadon, the two passionate horse-lovers who run it, have already had to turn away one animal because there was no money to feed him. He was taken away and shot. Others asking the Yeadons to take in an unwanted beast have also, reluctantly, been told they cannot be helped. The Yeadons have devoted the past 12 years to rescuing horses found abandoned in fields and sheds, starving and distressed, and nursing them back to health.

      "body": "<p>Much as we might prefer to forget, this was meant to be the year of the Dome. 'Believe me, it will be the envy of the world,' said Tony Blair unveiling those first gaudy computer renderings back in 1998. The Prime Minister professed to be so confident, because 'we can boast of a richness of talent in this country that is unparalleled, the finest artists, architects and designers... we are leading the world in creativity'. </p> <p>The wonder is that, despite the Prime Minister's frantic efforts to make us all stop worrying and love the Dome, Britain's architects have managed to emerge from disaster relatively unscathed. The Dome was the embodiment of the new, architect-designed Britain, the Britain of New Labour and new media. Most of it has gone down the dotcom drain. But seen simply as a work of architecture, the Dome itself has had a surprisingly easy ride - it is big, impressive and instantly recognisable. </p> <p>What really sticks in the craw is the profligate, wrong-headed, insane waste of money its contents represent. Despite the Prime Minister's claim that the project would not 'cost any taxpayer's money, just \u00a3400 million of lottery money', it is unlikely to leave much change from \u00a31 billion, including the \u00a3150m it cost to clear toxic waste away from the site. </p> <p> If British architecture is as costly as all that, it's amazing that there has not been a more militant reaction against it. Yet despite revelling in the difficulties of the wobbling footbridge and the French stone palmed off on the British Museum, we still seem to be in love with our architects.

      "bodyText": "Much as we might prefer to forget, this was meant to be the year of the Dome. 'Believe me, it will be the envy of the world,' said Tony Blair unveiling those first gaudy computer renderings back in 1998. The Prime Minister professed to be so confident, because 'we can boast of a richness of talent in this country that is unparalleled, the finest artists, architects and designers... we are leading the world in creativity'. The wonder is that, despite the Prime Minister's frantic efforts to make us all stop worrying and love the Dome, Britain's architects have managed to emerge from disaster relatively unscathed. The Dome was the embodiment of the new, architect-designed Britain, the Britain of New Labour and new media. Most of it has gone down the dotcom drain. But seen simply as a work of architecture, the Dome itself has had a surprisingly easy ride - it is big, impressive and instantly recognisable. What really sticks in the craw is the profligate, wrong-headed, insane waste of money its contents represent. Despite the Prime Minister's claim that the project would not 'cost any taxpayer's money, just \u00a3400 million of lottery money', it is unlikely to leave much change from \u00a31 billion, including the \u00a3150m it cost to clear toxic waste away from the site. If British architecture is as costly as all that, it's amazing that there has not been a more militant reaction against it. Yet despite revelling in the difficulties of the wobbling footbridge and the French stone palmed off on the British Museum, we still seem to be in love with our architects. They have, if nothing else, managed to make some pretty murky corners of Britain look glamorous. But as the Peckham tragedy played out on the security cameras of the same library that had flashed across our television screens a week earlier as the winner of the Stirling Prize, it showed design is not a magic wand wishing the traumas of a troubled society away.

      "body": "<p><strong>Cutting Edge: A Very British Christmas</strong> C4 <br> <strong>Hamleys: a Real Toy Story</strong> C4 <br> <strong>A Christmas Carol</strong> ITV <br> <strong>Mirrorball</strong> BBC1 <br> <strong>Death of The Dome</strong> BBC2 </p> <p>Paul, a turkey farmer interviewed in Cutting Edge 's 'A Very Cynical Christmas' - no, sorry, make that British Christmas - gave us a tour of his premises, which looked like Sizewell B: 'Five to six hundred thousand eggs in the summer... incubated at a temperature of 37.3 degrees... humidity at 29.5 degrees... eggs rotated through 90 degrees every hour... then from the hatchery - the maternity ward! - to the despatch room, where they're sexed... we do 20-hour days in the three or four days before Christmas... eating turkey every day for a fortnight... tasting a bird from each flock.' Flock: that was a tender, even twitcherly touch, given that Paul's turkey chicks don't really have the chance to get in touch with their inner flock, just blink, bob and gobble in their trays like a strain of feathery Pok\u00e9mon. </p> <p> Paul gave us some tips for turkey roasting: 'Pre-heat oven to 200 degrees... bird in the tin breast-down... 10 minutes a pound... turn over to brown breast off half an hour before it's finished cooking... test with a fork deep into the thigh muscle... if the juices run clear, it's cooked.' </p> <p> Now, like Paul, too much exposure to turkeys has made me keen on the idea of a Christmas goose, even though the last time I cooked one my husband left me shortly afterwards. How could I have known he was that fond of turkey? </p> <p> In Hamleys: a Real Toy Story, maintenance men Roy and Pat sat with their flasks under the strip-lighting in the Regent Street sub-basement ('near the Underground') and bemoaned the fact that 'this used to be the finest toyshop in the world, but it's gone down a bit'. At the end of 1999, the venerable institution's annual profits had plummeted from \u00a37 million to \u00a327,000, so there was a new boss (cheerful Simon, fresh from Virgin) and his deputy (scary John, Mr Flipchart, the Management Moonie). John corralled the sales staff and bullied them a bit ('dirty, dirty, dirty') before building them up again. 'We have the chance to do something about it, yeah?' 'Yeah,' muttered Andrew from toy soldiers and Libby from teddy bears half-heartedly. </p> <p> Elsewhere in Hamleys in 1999, Ian, a toy buyer like the Tom Hanks character in Big, went to New York to try to replicate his finest professional hour. In 1988, Ian had brought the dancing flower to Britain and was thus something of a legend in the business. 'It's one line in a lifetime,' he mused wistfully. 'I don't think I'll ever find another line like that.' Last Christmas, however, Ian surpassed himself, introducing the nation to both the microscooter and Big Mouth Billy Bass. </p> <p> The shop refit turned out to be the nightmare before Christmas. At the Nuremberg toy fair (who would have thought Nuremberg could be so much fun ?), Simon spotted a big train set he wanted to install in the shop, but you knew it was all going to go a bit Willy Wonka when he came home and commissioned a British company to provide the track. Dismalness ensued and the result was indeed, as Simon said, 'embarrassing, pathetic, boring'. The film crew even captured a disturbing close-up of a miniature derailment. </p> <p> Simon's CV does not, however, include Virgin trains, which is probably why he's become chairman and turned the company around. Though I do think he should give Fran ('I've been in showbusiness all my life') back her puppet show. And when, after 47 years of mole-like service, Pat retired his flask and handed over his keys to Roy, shouldn't he have been presented with an engraved Billy Bass? </p> <p> The best, and worst, thing about Christmas television is its awesome predictability, a feeling reinforced by ITV's A Christmas Carol, the festive vehicle for Ross Kemp. Like Scrooge during one of his groundhog Christmas Eves, the sharp-eyed viewer may have recognised that we've been here before. In this modern adaptation, Kemp played a loan shark whose beat was a council estate and, funnily enough, this was the very same council estate that, just a few weeks ago, acted as the backdrop for John Simm's loan shark in the excellent Never Never, so I hope the residents are on a profit-share scheme from the rental of their location and will now have a very merry Christmas without the distraction of any more unpleasant murders taking place in the underground car-park. </p> <p> Though Kemp's Scrooge all too predictably revisited the ghost of Grant Mitchell's past, this wasn't a bad Christmas Carol and there were some funny, panto-villainesque lines. When, for example, Bob Cratchit pleaded for time off work ('Tim's in hospital again, so I was thinking of the whole day'), Kemp, a thoroughly modern, Tropicana-orange- juice-drinking, Plasma-screen-watching Scrooge, added Loaded-style lairiness to the traditional litany of hisses and humbuggery: 'And I was thinking of inviting Britney Spears over for an eggnog.' </p> <p> D\u00e9j\u00e0-viewing, too, in Mirrorball, in which Jennifer Saunders has reconvened the Ab Fab team as a bunch of variously unsuccessful and monumentally talentless luvvies. Saunders's Edina is now Vivienne Keill who spent six years in Hollywood wearing a small rubber trunk in Star Trek, but admits that the 'peak of my career might have been playing Twisted Labia, sidekick to Little Nell in the non-Derek Jarman sequel to Jubilee - and even in that I wandered around with \"No Future\" felt-penned on my forehead.' </p> <p> Vivienne managed to beat off competition from Bonnie Langford (a multi-tasking enigma is Bonnie: she sent herself up beautifully here in the same week she appeared playing it straight on Barrymore and showing off her new baby in Hello! ) to win herself a role in the musical version of Angela's Ashes - her audition masterstroke a brogueish rendition of Send in the Clowns with a little light Riverdancing on the side. Meanwhile, Joanna Lumley's Patsy has been reconfigured as Jackie Riviera, star of Disco Follies '77 and a bottle blonde with black tips, exactly like an ageing Christina Aguilera. </p> <p> Mirrorball lacks Ab Fab 's Zeitgeisty absurdity, but you couldn't not giggle and everybody got a good line or two (the resting actress who had just lost her role in 'Tony and Cherie: the Musical', for example. All together now: 'We live at Ten and Eleven/ but we're all sixes and sevens...') and there was a tour de force from Jane Horrocks as the miserablist Nordic Yitta Hilberstam, whose CV included 'skippings, spinnings, dancings and showings at the Millennium Dome'. While Yitta sang 'Show Me the Way to the Next Whisky Bar', Vivienne watched admiringly: 'I should have done Brecht.' 'It's Weill,' said Jackie. 'It's working,' countered Viv.</p> <p> Though Mirrorball was billed as a pilot, I suspect Viv and Jackie might find themselves working in the longest run of their lives. </p> <p> In Death of the Dome, the world's emptiest metaphor was described by a gleeful cartoonist as 'a gift from God'.

      "bodyText": "Cutting Edge: A Very British Christmas C4 Hamleys: a Real Toy Story C4 A Christmas Carol ITV Mirrorball BBC1 Death of The Dome BBC2 Paul, a turkey farmer interviewed in Cutting Edge 's 'A Very Cynical Christmas' - no, sorry, make that British Christmas - gave us a tour of his premises, which looked like Sizewell B: 'Five to six hundred thousand eggs in the summer... incubated at a temperature of 37.3 degrees... humidity at 29.5 degrees... eggs rotated through 90 degrees every hour... then from the hatchery - the maternity ward! - to the despatch room, where they're sexed... we do 20-hour days in the three or four days before Christmas... eating turkey every day for a fortnight... tasting a bird from each flock.' Flock: that was a tender, even twitcherly touch, given that Paul's turkey chicks don't really have the chance to get in touch with their inner flock, just blink, bob and gobble in their trays like a strain of feathery Pok\u00e9mon. Paul gave us some tips for turkey roasting: 'Pre-heat oven to 200 degrees... bird in the tin breast-down... 10 minutes a pound... turn over to brown breast off half an hour before it's finished cooking... test with a fork deep into the thigh muscle... if the juices run clear, it's cooked.' Now, like Paul, too much exposure to turkeys has made me keen on the idea of a Christmas goose, even though the last time I cooked one my husband left me shortly afterwards. How could I have known he was that fond of turkey? In Hamleys: a Real Toy Story, maintenance men Roy and Pat sat with their flasks under the strip-lighting in the Regent Street sub-basement ('near the Underground') and bemoaned the fact that 'this used to be the finest toyshop in the world, but it's gone down a bit'. At the end of 1999, the venerable institution's annual profits had plummeted from \u00a37 million to \u00a327,000, so there was a new boss (cheerful Simon, fresh from Virgin) and his deputy (scary John, Mr Flipchart, the Management Moonie). John corralled the sales staff and bullied them a bit ('dirty, dirty, dirty') before building them up again. 'We have the chance to do something about it, yeah?' 'Yeah,' muttered Andrew from toy soldiers and Libby from teddy bears half-heartedly. Elsewhere in Hamleys in 1999, Ian, a toy buyer like the Tom Hanks character in Big, went to New York to try to replicate his finest professional hour. In 1988, Ian had brought the dancing flower to Britain and was thus something of a legend in the business. 'It's one line in a lifetime,' he mused wistfully. 'I don't think I'll ever find another line like that.' Last Christmas, however, Ian surpassed himself, introducing the nation to both the microscooter and Big Mouth Billy Bass. The shop refit turned out to be the nightmare before Christmas. At the Nuremberg toy fair (who would have thought Nuremberg could be so much fun ?), Simon spotted a big train set he wanted to install in the shop, but you knew it was all going to go a bit Willy Wonka when he came home and commissioned a British company to provide the track. Dismalness ensued and the result was indeed, as Simon said, 'embarrassing, pathetic, boring'. The film crew even captured a disturbing close-up of a miniature derailment. Simon's CV does not, however, include Virgin trains, which is probably why he's become chairman and turned the company around. Though I do think he should give Fran ('I've been in showbusiness all my life') back her puppet show. And when, after 47 years of mole-like service, Pat retired his flask and handed over his keys to Roy, shouldn't he have been presented with an engraved Billy Bass? The best, and worst, thing about Christmas television is its awesome predictability, a feeling reinforced by ITV's A Christmas Carol, the festive vehicle for Ross Kemp. Like Scrooge during one of his groundhog Christmas Eves, the sharp-eyed viewer may have recognised that we've been here before. In this modern adaptation, Kemp played a loan shark whose beat was a council estate and, funnily enough, this was the very same council estate that, just a few weeks ago, acted as the backdrop for John Simm's loan shark in the excellent Never Never, so I hope the residents are on a profit-share scheme from the rental of their location and will now have a very merry Christmas without the distraction of any more unpleasant murders taking place in the underground car-park. Though Kemp's Scrooge all too predictably revisited the ghost of Grant Mitchell's past, this wasn't a bad Christmas Carol and there were some funny, panto-villainesque lines. When, for example, Bob Cratchit pleaded for time off work ('Tim's in hospital again, so I was thinking of the whole day'), Kemp, a thoroughly modern, Tropicana-orange- juice-drinking, Plasma-screen-watching Scrooge, added Loaded-style lairiness to the traditional litany of hisses and humbuggery: 'And I was thinking of inviting Britney Spears over for an eggnog.' D\u00e9j\u00e0-viewing, too, in Mirrorball, in which Jennifer Saunders has reconvened the Ab Fab team as a bunch of variously unsuccessful and monumentally talentless luvvies. Saunders's Edina is now Vivienne Keill who spent six years in Hollywood wearing a small rubber trunk in Star Trek, but admits that the 'peak of my career might have been playing Twisted Labia, sidekick to Little Nell in the non-Derek Jarman sequel to Jubilee - and even in that I wandered around with \"No Future\" felt-penned on my forehead.' Vivienne managed to beat off competition from Bonnie Langford (a multi-tasking enigma is Bonnie: she sent herself up beautifully here in the same week she appeared playing it straight on Barrymore and showing off her new baby in Hello! ) to win herself a role in the musical version of Angela's Ashes - her audition masterstroke a brogueish rendition of Send in the Clowns with a little light Riverdancing on the side. Meanwhile, Joanna Lumley's Patsy has been reconfigured as Jackie Riviera, star of Disco Follies '77 and a bottle blonde with black tips, exactly like an ageing Christina Aguilera. Mirrorball lacks Ab Fab 's Zeitgeisty absurdity, but you couldn't not giggle and everybody got a good line or two (the resting actress who had just lost her role in 'Tony and Cherie: the Musical', for example. All together now: 'We live at Ten and Eleven/ but we're all sixes and sevens...') and there was a tour de force from Jane Horrocks as the miserablist Nordic Yitta Hilberstam, whose CV included 'skippings, spinnings, dancings and showings at the Millennium Dome'. While Yitta sang 'Show Me the Way to the Next Whisky Bar', Vivienne watched admiringly: 'I should have done Brecht.' 'It's Weill,' said Jackie. 'It's working,' countered Viv. Though Mirrorball was billed as a pilot, I suspect Viv and Jackie might find themselves working in the longest run of their lives. In Death of the Dome, the world's emptiest metaphor was described by a gleeful cartoonist as 'a gift from God'. A gift from God, too, for the makers of last year's riveting Trouble at the Big Top, whose final visit this was. It was good to catch up with the cast again: bow-tied, buffoonish Derek, creator of the Earth Zone; that nice couple with the baby who had created the Play Zone (and won an award for it. Presumably the only award the Dome has ever received that hasn't been subsidised by the tax payer), and John Hackney, the man who filled the Body Zone with Tommy Cooper and pubic hair. The show was unadulterated joy: from the footage of the PR d\u00e9bcle that was last New Year's Eve (and from which the tent never recovered, as small children cried before they'd even set foot in the place and angry broadsheet editors bristled), right up to the final shots of piled-high mini Domes reduced from \u00a310 to \u00a34.99. 'There were problems with people not knowing how to turn it on in the morning,' said Hackney of his beleaguered body, though next week the Body Zone will finally be able to sigh and say: 'Not now, Monsieur Gerbeau, I've got a headache,' and get away with it. Predictably but perversely, this knowledge made me want to rush straight to Greenwich, if only because, having sold so few of them, the souvenirs are bound to become very collectable.",

There were intriguing debuts (Badly Drawn Boy, Coldplay, Tom McRae) and convincing returns (U2, PJ Harvey). The British underground conjured up another genre, UK Garage, and the artists to take it to the mainstream (Craig David, Wookie). From America's margins, outfits such as Lambchop and Grandaddy issued lo-fi gems and African-Americans confirmed their rediscovery of their soulful traditions with albums by D'Angelo, Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Angie Stone and more.

Obsessed with snatching a bite of the pre-teen market, they have thrown money at anonymous boy and girl groups rather than developing talent that might provide long- term returns via album sales. </p> <p>Coupled with the fame- school ethic that has invaded British pop - it doesn't matter whether you make it as a soap star, a games show presenter or a pop star, as long as you make it - one result has been a succession of vacuous hits. </p> <p>Another has been the decline of the British music industry as a global force, able to punch above its weight by producing influential, internationally renowned acts - the Beatles and Stones legacy. Sure, we still export Robbie Williams and Blur to Belgium and Australia, but in the all- important American market, only one British act made any serious impact in 2000 - Radiohead, whose defiantly experimental Kid A album hit the top of the US charts. The managing director of Radiohead's record company, Tony Wadsworth of EMI, bravely observed that 'the message is clear for UK record companies: take risks, ditch the formulae and support creative artist development, because it pays off.' Ironically, EMI, the last British major record company left standing, spent the year expecting to be merged with one or another multinational conglomerate; first Warners, then Bertelsmann, owners of the BMG group. </p> <p>At times British pop seemed degraded into an adjunct of Celebrity Squares. Posh'n'Becks, Madonna'n'Guy and Liam'n'Nicole merged into one continuous Heat cover story, and record companies fought to put out singles by Big Brother contestants. Add to that the ascendancy of the manufactured teen idol - Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, S Club 7 - and the decline of pop as a form of vigorous self-expression is obvious, and, as the feeble output of the solo Spice Girls attests, it doesn't make for memorable music. Or memorable viewing. It was in character with the year that the one television music show that doesn't follow the agenda of Saturday morning kids' telly - Later - found itself under threat. </p> <p>The rise and rise of teeny pop partly reflects the long- term decline of the rock band as pop's driving force, a decline attested to by the closure of Melody Maker and Select, and neatly symbolised in the feud between Robbie Williams and Liam Gallagher. Guys with guitars aren't going away, but they're no longer centre stage, not in the era of rap, disco divas and the Ministry of Sound. Bono, who fulminated against the young breed of pop star, is just going to have to live with it. To drive the point home came a characterless fourth album from Oasis, followed by a live record which suggested their mutation into a Spinal Tap for the new century. </p> <p>The phenomenon of the year was Eminem. The brattish rapper not only shipped bucketloads of The Marshall Mathers LP, but put on a non-stop show in which bad behaviour, unsavoury attitudes and provocative insight came hopelessly jumbled. His trailer-trash tales, an accurate reflection of the nihilism and dystopia of the American underclass, disturbed his homeland's rose-tinted view of itself, while his misogyny and homophobia made him a hostage to fortune. Being sued by your own mother, though, is a new trick even to pop. </p> <p>Eminem had plenty to say about the issue which loomed like a storm cloud over the music business in 2000; the internet. His vow to 'beat the shit' out of anyone posting his music on the internet, there to be downloaded free, summed up the attitude of many musicians faced with their copyright melting into cyberspace. Led by Metallica, who bizarrely threatened to sue their own fans, the music biz waged war against Napster, the site which had caused a furore by offering a way for fans to trade MP3 music files. But in October music giant BMG signed a deal with Napster to become web partners. </p> <p>The battle is in the balance, and the war over copyright, and how you exercise it, is only beginning.

      "body": "<p>It is hard to see how Madonna could have got it any more exuberantly wrong. I mean, good luck with the honeymoon and the new life in Britain, but... has some so-called friend been deliberately nasty here? In 1967, the New Statesman ran a now-famous competition inviting readers to give misleading advice for first-time visitors to London - do try the famous echo in the British Museum Reading Room; do not insult a cabbie by offering him a tip; it is impolite not to help a fellow rail-traveller stuck on a crossword clue - that kind of thing. Today, we can only look at the new Mrs Ritchie and sigh, sadly assuming that some maleficent scapegrace pulled her aside a few weeks ago and offered the following weasel words: 'British people will think you possess class if you go shooting.' </p> <p>There is no excuse. Even had she simply stuck with the clay-pigeon stuff she still would have been stranding herself firmly below the salt, condemned to a dire netherworld where the gauche and the d\u00e9class\u00e9 bask queasily in the flatus of past mediocrity. Roger Waters goes clay-pigeon shooting; Mark Knopfler goes clay-pigeon shooting. Everyone who has ever produced a 'concept album' would appear to feel the need to fire a shotgun aimed, quite unaccountably, away from their face. And these are the talented ones. Jeremy Clarkson shoots. Ronan Keating shoots. Dani Behr shoots. What a lovely paragraph this would be without the full stops. Sad, damp, middle-of-the-litter marketing managers with failed 'careers' and thin, bitter wives go clay-pigeon shooting together, between their damn seminars. And they all buy the same horrid stuff, the waxes and pouches and nettings and straps and tailormade Purdeys, all greasily reeking of greed and stupidity; and they preen over the tags and logos, thinking they confer an air of \u00e9lan rather than conferring an air of belonging to a club of vulgar, blank-eyed, spoon-fed ox-people. </p> <p>So that would have been bad enough. But Madonna went further and shot things, real flapping things, on a real estate in Scotland. This, you might think, should at least free her from the horrible nouve stigma of the clay-people; at least the real toffs wear proper logo-free clothes, old battered socks sewn together from ancient tramps' noses and grim Highland tabards steeped for a decade outside some festering Harris hovel in a butt of crofter's urine. </p> <p>Wrong. It's still not classy. For this is what we should be objecting to: the tawdry coarseness of the whole thing. It's not the flapping, furry things - we don't normally give a damn, do we, what happens to them? When the Queen was pictured strangling that pheasant a few weeks ago, we weren't all that moved for the pheasant. Who, honestly, had wondered, the day before, 'Hmm... wonder how Walter the Pheasant's doing up at Balmoral?' </p> <p>No, it's not the birds that should concern us but the sheer dumb baseness and tat of the whole gun business. It encapsulates the precise opposite of what can be beautiful, clever, inspiring and tasteful about British life. How smart do you have to be to pull a trigger back half an inch? What majestic co-ordination of the senses do you need in order to hit one of 20 birds flapping across your vision eight yards away? Remember - the people who go shooting are the kind of people who think black labradors are intelligent dogs. </p> <p>And the kind of people who think bloodlust is a Good Thing. For that's precisely the emotion it inspires, and no one is immune. An ex-girlfriend remembers being shocked as a child by the change which swept across her father, in other times a kindly, artistic soul, on the moors. 'He got so excited about it that he made me remove my coat just so he could use it to hold the red-hot barrels and keep on firing. Then my scarf, then my jersey, then my hat.' </p> <p>The aristocracy's best argument is that shooting preserves the countryside. This is, in fact, partly valid, for no one else has the money or the inclination to preserve it; it's flawed only in that no one else gets to see the saved countryside. But we're not concerned with those arguments here, and nor should Madonna be: this is a question of taste. You were wrongly advised, dear lady. Shooting is not vogue.</p>",

I mean, good luck with the honeymoon and the new life in Britain, but... has some so-called friend been deliberately nasty here? In 1967, the New Statesman ran a now-famous competition inviting readers to give misleading advice for first-time visitors to London - do try the famous echo in the British Museum Reading Room; do not insult a cabbie by offering him a tip; it is impolite not to help a fellow rail-traveller stuck on a crossword clue - that kind of thing. Today, we can only look at the new Mrs Ritchie and sigh, sadly assuming that some maleficent scapegrace pulled her aside a few weeks ago and offered the following weasel words: 'British people will think you possess class if you go shooting.' There is no excuse. Even had she simply stuck with the clay-pigeon stuff she still would have been stranding herself firmly below the salt, condemned to a dire netherworld where the gauche and the d\u00e9class\u00e9 bask queasily in the flatus of past mediocrity. Roger Waters goes clay-pigeon shooting; Mark Knopfler goes clay-pigeon shooting. Everyone who has ever produced a 'concept album' would appear to feel the need to fire a shotgun aimed, quite unaccountably, away from their face. And these are the talented ones. Jeremy Clarkson shoots. Ronan Keating shoots. Dani Behr shoots. What a lovely paragraph this would be without the full stops. Sad, damp, middle-of-the-litter marketing managers with failed 'careers' and thin, bitter wives go clay-pigeon shooting together, between their damn seminars. And they all buy the same horrid stuff, the waxes and pouches and nettings and straps and tailormade Purdeys, all greasily reeking of greed and stupidity; and they preen over the tags and logos, thinking they confer an air of \u00e9lan rather than conferring an air of belonging to a club of vulgar, blank-eyed, spoon-fed ox-people. So that would have been bad enough. But Madonna went further and shot things, real flapping things, on a real estate in Scotland. This, you might think, should at least free her from the horrible nouve stigma of the clay-people; at least the real toffs wear proper logo-free clothes, old battered socks sewn together from ancient tramps' noses and grim Highland tabards steeped for a decade outside some festering Harris hovel in a butt of crofter's urine. Wrong. It's still not classy. For this is what we should be objecting to: the tawdry coarseness of the whole thing. It's not the flapping, furry things - we don't normally give a damn, do we, what happens to them? When the Queen was pictured strangling that pheasant a few weeks ago, we weren't all that moved for the pheasant. Who, honestly, had wondered, the day before, 'Hmm... wonder how Walter the Pheasant's doing up at Balmoral?' No, it's not the birds that should concern us but the sheer dumb baseness and tat of the whole gun business. It encapsulates the precise opposite of what can be beautiful, clever, inspiring and tasteful about British life. How smart do you have to be to pull a trigger back half an inch? What majestic co-ordination of the senses do you need in order to hit one of 20 birds flapping across your vision eight yards away? Remember - the people who go shooting are the kind of people who think black labradors are intelligent dogs. And the kind of people who think bloodlust is a Good Thing. For that's precisely the emotion it inspires, and no one is immune. An ex-girlfriend remembers being shocked as a child by the change which swept across her father, in other times a kindly, artistic soul, on the moors. 'He got so excited about it that he made me remove my coat just so he could use it to hold the red-hot barrels and keep on firing. Then my scarf, then my jersey, then my hat.' The aristocracy's best argument is that shooting preserves the countryside. This is, in fact, partly valid, for no one else has the money or the inclination to preserve it; it's flawed only in that no one else gets to see the saved countryside. But we're not concerned with those arguments here, and nor should Madonna be: this is a question of taste. You were wrongly advised, dear lady. Shooting is not vogue.",

Kevin was checking what he needed for domestic science on Monday and realised he was a few eggs short. At 8.30, he went to the shop, carrying just \u00a31. He should have been 10 to 15 minutes, but hadn't returned by 10pm. It was totally out of character. <p>That first night was terrible: I visited the hospital, and reported him missing, and my wife Terry and I took it in turns to drive around looking for him. </p> <p>The police interviewed Kevin's friends, teachers, the people he worked with. Everyone in the community was involved. There were even nationwide television appeals. They found nothing. This will be our 14th Christmas without him. My heart gets stuck in my throat at the thought of receiving a card or a phone call - any form of communication. And as it's a family time, a lot of thought goes out to him. </p> <p>The police put us in touch with the National Missing Persons Helpline and Janet became our caseworker. She was a godsend. Other people would think you had done something wrong. Not Janet. When someone goes missing, you feel numb, you can't grieve properly because there's no body. Janet was someone to bounce ideas off and she'd make you feel you were contributing, whereas most of the time you'd feel helpless. Sometimes I'd think I could cope better if he'd been killed, or phoned and said he didn't want any contact. Not knowing is hard: you can't move on and you feel guilty for not thinking about him.</p> <p>Kevin going missing took its toll on the family - my wife and I would blame each other, we'd also become overprotective of his sister Alex and she'd become resentful. Janet was always cool, calm and reassuring; she'd help get things back into perspective.</p> <p>When my wife died of a tumour, Janet was there to console me, which was what I really needed. I really appreciate Janet's friendship, as well as her support. We are united by a common goal: we both want to find my son, and it's reassuring to know she's out there trying to make that happen.</p> <p><b>Janet Newman:</b> When Kevin disappeared, the only information on missing people that existed was a photocard index at Scotland Yard listing only the basic details. My sister and I had been working with the police on a missing person case and they encouraged us to start a support network. This laid the foundations of what was to become the Missing Persons Helpline.</p> <p>We look after the family of the missing person, help them when they're vulnerable, talk to them when they feel low and offer friendship. We also generate publicity in the hope of finding the missing person.</p> <p>The Hicks family was one of the first cases we took on. I was their caseworker from day one. I would try not to get too involved, but I inevitably did. Derek and his wife were tremendously brave. They were bewildered as to what had happened. For Kevin to visit the corner shop and then vanish into thin air was just unbelievable. Every day was like living in a fog. Practical things, such as leaving the house, would become an effort - they'd be terrified to go out in case they missed a vital phone call.</p> <p>Then and now, it was easier for Derek to talk to me. Neighbours and friends tend to appropriate blame. Derek and I would talk about other things, anything that would give some clues. Sadly, we drew a blank. There was nothing to give any indication as to why Kevin would go missing, and all I could do was keep supporting the family. </p> <p>Even when Terry was terminally ill, they still went ahead with a television appeal, and it's tragic that she never knew what had happened to her son. I was shattered for Derek when she died; they were a lovely couple and had been through so much. </p> <p>I'm still here for Derek. Even now we're exploring new angles. This month we are releasing an age-progressed photo of what Kevin would look like aged 30. Christmas is a vulnerable time; it can make the loss all the more profound. Emotions may have eroded over time, but they never go away.</p> <p>I admire Derek for his inner strength - he'll never give up.

The authorities displayed weapons they found inside - pistols, home-made flame-throwers, bows and arrows tipped with syringe needles.</p> <p>After four days of fighting that left at least 26 inmates and two soldiers dead, with 133 injured, the Turkish government regained control of 20 jails across the country. The last to resist, Umraniye jail in Istanbul, was retaken on Friday when 430 inmates surrendered.</p> <p>According to the Interior Ministry, 16 of the inmates who died over the four days burnt themselves alive. For an operation named 'Return To Life', it was a bloody legacy.</p> <p>Yesterday the authorities began the task of explaining to their own people and the international community - long critical of a prison system riddled with corruption and violence - why the assaults had been necessary.</p> <p>Interior Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said: 'I would like the Turkish nation to openly see how the terrorist organisations were dragging our young into a quagmire.'</p> <p>The government has been under growing pressure to impose discipline on Turkey's jails. The latest bout of unrest began months ago, when the authorities decided to dismantle the large wards which, they said, were ungovernable and often no-go areas for staff, and replace them with smaller units.</p> <p>Militants said that they feared the authorities would abuse them if they were separated from each other, and hundreds began a hunger strike that they vowed to continue until they died or the government backed down.</p> <p>The government's offer to postpone opening the new jails had no effect. On Tuesday, hundreds of troops stormed 20 prisons.</p> <p>Inmates who had been on a hunger strike for almost two months were taken to hospitals, where many were refusing medical treatment. Officials have said they will be fed by force if necessary.</p> <p>The authorities took the media to some of the prisons involved. At Istanbul's Bayr-ampasa jail they said that the wards, holding more than a dozen prisoners each, were being run by the inmates and had, in effect, degenerated into militant training camps.</p> <p>Bayrampasa housed the leaders of the militant left- wing Revolutionary People's Liberation Party Front, the Turkish Workers and Peasant Liberation Army, the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party and the Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK, which had called off its hunger strike.</p> <p>Police showed reporters captured weapons, including a Kalashnikov assault rifle and 57 spent bullets, four pistols, 101 knives and dozens of arrows topped with needles from syringes. The inmates also had makeshift gas masks made of plastic soft-drink bottles, as well as a home-made satellite dish.</p> <p>On Tuesday soldiers burst in and fought their way into the wards - the first time the authorities had entered some of the areas in almost a decade.</p> <p>Days later, bullet holes could be seen in the doors and walls of the wards. Black soot covered most of the living quarters of the two-floor wards, which were littered with charred mattresses.</p> <p>The downstairs area was covered with broken desks and chairs. A smashed aquarium lay scattered in the corner of one ward.</p> <p>In the garden outside one of the wards sat a large cage filled with 30 black-and-white pigeons that the inmates were raising. The cage was partly smashed open, but the pigeons remained inside. Raising pigeons is a popular hobby in Turkey.</p> <p>In other jails, overcrowded wards housing 100 inmates were controlled by Stalinist organisations or by the extreme Islamist groups. If it wasn't one of the political organisations, it was mafia- type gangs that ruled the roost.</p> <p>In the new prisons, called F-type, individual cells or rooms house two or three people. The authorities showed journalists around, pointing to the better personal space and modern facilities.</p> <p>But human rights groups say the problems go much deeper than the accommodation. They include corrupt warders and systematic violence against prisoners.</p> <p>'If you want to measure the value of human life in a society, look at the prisons,' says Yilmaz Ensaroglu, president of the human rights group Mazlum Der. 'The scene at the end of this latest crackdown is the glorification of death by the militants and the scant disregard for human life by the officials. What I see in this mirror horrifies me.'</p> <p>In addition to the move to small cells, the Turkish government has begun freeing thousands of inmates to reduce overcrowding and make it easier to take control of the prisons.</p> <p>The government freed hundreds of prisoners on Friday as the widespread amnesty began.</p> <p>The amnesty will free half of the country's 72,000 prisoners, but will not apply to prisoners who opposed the state. That includes Islamic, Kurdish or left-wing radicals such as those at Bayrampasa.</p>",

The authorities displayed weapons they found inside - pistols, home-made flame-throwers, bows and arrows tipped with syringe needles. After four days of fighting that left at least 26 inmates and two soldiers dead, with 133 injured, the Turkish government regained control of 20 jails across the country. The last to resist, Umraniye jail in Istanbul, was retaken on Friday when 430 inmates surrendered. According to the Interior Ministry, 16 of the inmates who died over the four days burnt themselves alive. For an operation named 'Return To Life', it was a bloody legacy. Yesterday the authorities began the task of explaining to their own people and the international community - long critical of a prison system riddled with corruption and violence - why the assaults had been necessary. Interior Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said: 'I would like the Turkish nation to openly see how the terrorist organisations were dragging our young into a quagmire.' The government has been under growing pressure to impose discipline on Turkey's jails. The latest bout of unrest began months ago, when the authorities decided to dismantle the large wards which, they said, were ungovernable and often no-go areas for staff, and replace them with smaller units. Militants said that they feared the authorities would abuse them if they were separated from each other, and hundreds began a hunger strike that they vowed to continue until they died or the government backed down. The government's offer to postpone opening the new jails had no effect. On Tuesday, hundreds of troops stormed 20 prisons. Inmates who had been on a hunger strike for almost two months were taken to hospitals, where many were refusing medical treatment. Officials have said they will be fed by force if necessary. The authorities took the media to some of the prisons involved. At Istanbul's Bayr-ampasa jail they said that the wards, holding more than a dozen prisoners each, were being run by the inmates and had, in effect, degenerated into militant training camps. Bayrampasa housed the leaders of the militant left- wing Revolutionary People's Liberation Party Front, the Turkish Workers and Peasant Liberation Army, the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party and the Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK, which had called off its hunger strike. Police showed reporters captured weapons, including a Kalashnikov assault rifle and 57 spent bullets, four pistols, 101 knives and dozens of arrows topped with needles from syringes. The inmates also had makeshift gas masks made of plastic soft-drink bottles, as well as a home-made satellite dish. On Tuesday soldiers burst in and fought their way into the wards - the first time the authorities had entered some of the areas in almost a decade. Days later, bullet holes could be seen in the doors and walls of the wards. Black soot covered most of the living quarters of the two-floor wards, which were littered with charred mattresses. The downstairs area was covered with broken desks and chairs. A smashed aquarium lay scattered in the corner of one ward. In the garden outside one of the wards sat a large cage filled with 30 black-and-white pigeons that the inmates were raising. The cage was partly smashed open, but the pigeons remained inside. Raising pigeons is a popular hobby in Turkey. In other jails, overcrowded wards housing 100 inmates were controlled by Stalinist organisations or by the extreme Islamist groups. If it wasn't one of the political organisations, it was mafia- type gangs that ruled the roost. In the new prisons, called F-type, individual cells or rooms house two or three people. The authorities showed journalists around, pointing to the better personal space and modern facilities. But human rights groups say the problems go much deeper than the accommodation. They include corrupt warders and systematic violence against prisoners. 'If you want to measure the value of human life in a society, look at the prisons,' says Yilmaz Ensaroglu, president of the human rights group Mazlum Der. 'The scene at the end of this latest crackdown is the glorification of death by the militants and the scant disregard for human life by the officials. What I see in this mirror horrifies me.' In addition to the move to small cells, the Turkish government has begun freeing thousands of inmates to reduce overcrowding and make it easier to take control of the prisons. The government freed hundreds of prisoners on Friday as the widespread amnesty began. The amnesty will free half of the country's 72,000 prisoners, but will not apply to prisoners who opposed the state. That includes Islamic, Kurdish or left-wing radicals such as those at Bayrampasa.",

Their only concession to human kind is a gut-churning version of John Lennon's 'Happy Xmas [War Is Over]', itself a blood-curdling indicator of the late Beatles's egotistical nature. As Sharon, Caroline and Andrea wave to us and chant 'War Is Over', the crowds at Wembley hold hands: three generations of one family stand up behind me and embrace in a group hug. I look for the nearest exit. Looking across the crowd at Wembley - middle aged, suburban, reluctant to dance - you feel the Corrs' audience mightn't ever tire of listening to these airbrushed hymns to Ireland. And yet the music isn't so dreadful, nor will it sound dated this time next year. No, the Corrs have another problem - a hurdle only they can overcome. Put the fiddle and the tin whistle into storage: some national artefacts are worth leaving alone.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Freeze Frame: Jacques Henri Lartigue</strong></p> <p> Michael Hoppen Gallery, London, until 31 January 2001 </p> <p> Although Jacques Henri Lartigue was nearly 70 when his photographs were first exhibited, the work in his inaugural show was primarily that of a child artist. Of the 42 pictures on the walls of New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1963, only three were taken after the First World War. </p> <p>It says something about the quality of all of Lartigue's work that his earliest could be seen as representative. There is an infectious, childlike glee in his photographs, from a shot of his uncles fighting, both straddled on a log laid across a stream, to a luscious picture of cabaret dancers relaxing on the Riviera. He was a master of the family snapshot, the fleeting moment, the sunny smile. </p> <p>Lartigue was born in Paris at the end of the nineteenth century into a wealthy, high-society family with a few eccentrics in its midst. His father was a banker and keen amateur photographer. His grandfather was one of the inventors of the monorail system, and his elder brother designed and built aeroplanes as early as 1908. In his twenties, Lartigue married Bibi, the daughter of Andr\u00e9 Messager, a composer, conductor and manager of the Paris Opera. </p> <p>Later, he became involved with a succession of beautiful women - Ren\u00e9e, Coco, Florette - all of them the epitome of Parisian chic. Lartigue was given his first camera at the age of seven, and from that moment he photographed this life - of winters spent skiing in Chamonix or St Moritz, of summers in Nice, promenades in the park and days at the races; Bibi in the bath on their honeymoon, Florette splashing water on her infinite fingernails, Ren\u00e9e as a smoky cover girl in an open-topped car. He was never a reporter - just a man with a camera and an unfailing eye. </p> <p>When he was five, Lartigue developed a sort of pre-photographic trick. He was too young to join in his brother's games, but he found a fun way of watching them by opening and shutting his eyes, so that all the images he liked were frozen and stored in his brain. </p> <p>When he came into contact with photography, he was frustrated that his trick didn't work on film - his father's large-format camera could only capture still objects, whereas he wanted to record speed, to stop time in motion. As soon as he was given his own small camera, Lartigue was in his element. He had a passion for capturing things and people in mid-air - a jump or a splash or a twirl would be frozen half-way through, absurd and elated. When his brother tried out his new glider, Lartigue was there, tracking its halting progress through the sky. When a hot-air balloon was sent up, when a grinning woman leapt down the stairs, when his cousin fell into the water - Lartigue was there. </p> <p>Michael Hoppen's small exhibition is like a crystallisation of the best of Lartigue. As its inspired title suggests, the show brings together several mid-air shots, many of which have never been seen before, and combines them with a winter theme. They were taken between the ages of nine and 86; in a neighbouring room, vintage prints are for sale, including the very first photograph Lartigue took. </p> <p>In the main room, vast expanses of beautiful whiteness, directly opposed to the better known summer scenes, give the impression that the jumping skier, the spinning skater or the speeding sled have been frozen on to the photo's surface literally, by some act of nature. The photographer's cousin, Simone, does a twirl on the ice rink in the arms of her partner; a somersaulting skier hangs vertically from the sky looking down at the snow, as if he has somehow misunderstood the sport. </p> <p>My favourite is the ultimate freeze frame: an action portrait of Francis Pigueron skating, his arms spread out, his legs in the middle of a balletic spin, floating high above the ice. He is even above, in this perspective, the tall pine trees in the distance and caught, like a puppet, between two perfectly equidistant Alps. </p> <p>For many early photographers, the magic of the medium was the way it captured light. For Lartigue, it was the way it sealed off time. </p> <p>But looking at these snowy views, you begin to wonder if the young cameraman might have believed his new toy had even greater powers - to interfere with the laws of physics and stop the pull of gravity.</p>",

      "body": "<b> La Cenerentola</b> Royal Opera House, London WC2 <p> Cinderella's glass slipper, one of the most resonant and miraculous moments in any fairytale, does not appear in Rossini's version of the story. Its very existence, anyway, is a happy result of a mistranslation, though how much more magical, fragile and dangerous is a shoe 'en verre' than the fur slipper ('pantoufle en vair') of Perrault's seventeenth-century original. In Rossini, footwear has been replaced, less erotically, by a silver bracelet. Indeed, La Cenerentola (1817) bears only a superficial resemblance to the story we know, largely perhaps because of the need to feature its star tenor, the Prince, long before we get to the palace. </p> <p>Angelina is Cinderella. She has two stepsisters but no pumpkin carriage or fairy godmother. Rossini was always more concerned with human foibles than supernatural happenings. Thus power, influence and disguise replace magic. Alidoro, the Prince's mysterious tutor, dresses up as a beggar and goes in search of a worthy wife for his pupil. </p> <p>Having found Cinders, he makes sure that she does go to the ball, in a peacock-blue Rolls-Royce. The Prince in turn disguises himself as his valet Dandini, while the valet has fun (somehow more than we do) playing at being the Prince - all of which gives Rossini ample opportunity to indulge in several of the brilliant 'confusion' ensembles which are a hallmark of his comic operas. </p> <p>The wonder is that anyone can keep up the pretence of not knowing who each other is for as long as they do. During the not infrequent longueurs, you feel like shouting out: 'It's Cinderella!' Hurriedly written in only three weeks, with a rambling structure, La Cenerentola has little drama. </p> <p>The Royal Opera's shiny new production kept the pace moving. In Mark Elder, singers and orchestra had a conductor who understands Rossini's taut, percussive rhythms. He negotiated the score's brittle musical wit with grace, like a cat running across burning coals. </p> <p>You knew the performance was in good hands from the crisply played overture which the composer, a keen recycler, borrowed from his own opera, La gazzetta . The bassoon rattled out his belching arpeggios with gunfire rapidity. Woodwind detail sounded zestful and bright. All relished the crescendo which gradually consumes the entire orchestra, one of Rossini's oldest tricks and still one of his best. </p> <p>Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier, fresh from recent successes at Opera North and Welsh National Opera, made their Royal Opera debuts as directors. Action is removed to the 1950s, with the ugly sisters, Clorinda and Tisbe, as film starlets chased by trilby-wearing paparazzi. Tisbe looked especially fetching as a d\u00e9collet\u00e9 prelate in swathes of crimson silk and skull cap. </p> <p>Christian Fenouillat's sets, complete with tubular chairs, octagonal Bialetti coffee pot and other apt period detail, looked clean and handsome. Different shades of lighting (designed by Christophe Forey), from lime to lilac, created variety. The transformation from Cinders's kitchen to the royal ballroom was swift and efficient - still a novelty to be able to say that of the Royal Opera's potentially versatile new stage equipment which has so often held up or let down proceedings. </p> <p>Best of all, the cast were experienced Rossinian singers. Occasional lapses aside, they knew the idiom and the elaborate, many-layered sextet in which the confusion is unravelled, was carried off superbly. As the Prince, the slightly built, intense Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez announced his quality as a singer from his first inconsequential notes. When he reached his great three-tiered aria in Act II, his voice shone out with steely magnificence and brought the truest dramatic moment of the evening. </p> <p>The Sicilian bass-baritone Simone Alaimo is a celebrated Rossini singer, and a regular at the annual Pesaro festival devoted to the composer's works. As the gruesome stepfather Dom Magnifico, he had a natural sense of comic timing. Two British singers, Nicole Tibbels and Leah-Marian Jones, proved entertaining as the preening ugly sisters, with another Italian, Sonia Ganassi, in the title role. She had brilliant moments but seemed uncertain how to add flesh to this mouse-like role. Never mind. The production has charm and energy. It should be a box-office hit. Or see it on BBC2 on Boxing Day at 2.50pm. </p> <p>TV schedulers, a peculiar breed, seem to assume that socially inept music lovers, bereft of concerts, will have nothing to fill the long festive hours. Accordingly, they squeeze a year's worth of viewing into a long weekend. If you watched everything, you could certainly escape all other obligations. Here are some of the best: Choir of the Year (BBC2 today, 26 and 27 December); Glyndebourne's La Boh\u00e8me (Christmas Day, Channel 4); and an Alfred Brendel documentary (BBC2 Christmas Day). </p> <p>On New Year's Day, the new digital channel, Artsworld, shows the marvellous Cecilia Bartoli singing Vivaldi. Radio 3 is full of seasonal treats, including La Traviata Live from the Met on 30 December. And once you've tired of rissoles and r\u00e9chauff\u00e9s (genres not unknown to the opera world), you can watch Elijah Moshinsky's production of Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail filmed in Istanbul (BBC2, 29 December). Since the title was thought too daunting for TV viewers, they have plumped for a name which sounds like the ultimate seasonal dish: Mozart in Turkey.</p>",

      "bodyText": "La Cenerentola Royal Opera House, London WC2 Cinderella's glass slipper, one of the most resonant and miraculous moments in any fairytale, does not appear in Rossini's version of the story. Its very existence, anyway, is a happy result of a mistranslation, though how much more magical, fragile and dangerous is a shoe 'en verre' than the fur slipper ('pantoufle en vair') of Perrault's seventeenth-century original. In Rossini, footwear has been replaced, less erotically, by a silver bracelet. Indeed, La Cenerentola (1817) bears only a superficial resemblance to the story we know, largely perhaps because of the need to feature its star tenor, the Prince, long before we get to the palace. Angelina is Cinderella. She has two stepsisters but no pumpkin carriage or fairy godmother. Rossini was always more concerned with human foibles than supernatural happenings. Thus power, influence and disguise replace magic. Alidoro, the Prince's mysterious tutor, dresses up as a beggar and goes in search of a worthy wife for his pupil. Having found Cinders, he makes sure that she does go to the ball, in a peacock-blue Rolls-Royce. The Prince in turn disguises himself as his valet Dandini, while the valet has fun (somehow more than we do) playing at being the Prince - all of which gives Rossini ample opportunity to indulge in several of the brilliant 'confusion' ensembles which are a hallmark of his comic operas. The wonder is that anyone can keep up the pretence of not knowing who each other is for as long as they do. During the not infrequent longueurs, you feel like shouting out: 'It's Cinderella!' Hurriedly written in only three weeks, with a rambling structure, La Cenerentola has little drama. The Royal Opera's shiny new production kept the pace moving. In Mark Elder, singers and orchestra had a conductor who understands Rossini's taut, percussive rhythms. He negotiated the score's brittle musical wit with grace, like a cat running across burning coals. You knew the performance was in good hands from the crisply played overture which the composer, a keen recycler, borrowed from his own opera, La gazzetta . The bassoon rattled out his belching arpeggios with gunfire rapidity. Woodwind detail sounded zestful and bright. All relished the crescendo which gradually consumes the entire orchestra, one of Rossini's oldest tricks and still one of his best. Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier, fresh from recent successes at Opera North and Welsh National Opera, made their Royal Opera debuts as directors. Action is removed to the 1950s, with the ugly sisters, Clorinda and Tisbe, as film starlets chased by trilby-wearing paparazzi. Tisbe looked especially fetching as a d\u00e9collet\u00e9 prelate in swathes of crimson silk and skull cap. Christian Fenouillat's sets, complete with tubular chairs, octagonal Bialetti coffee pot and other apt period detail, looked clean and handsome. Different shades of lighting (designed by Christophe Forey), from lime to lilac, created variety. The transformation from Cinders's kitchen to the royal ballroom was swift and efficient - still a novelty to be able to say that of the Royal Opera's potentially versatile new stage equipment which has so often held up or let down proceedings. Best of all, the cast were experienced Rossinian singers. Occasional lapses aside, they knew the idiom and the elaborate, many-layered sextet in which the confusion is unravelled, was carried off superbly. As the Prince, the slightly built, intense Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez announced his quality as a singer from his first inconsequential notes. When he reached his great three-tiered aria in Act II, his voice shone out with steely magnificence and brought the truest dramatic moment of the evening. The Sicilian bass-baritone Simone Alaimo is a celebrated Rossini singer, and a regular at the annual Pesaro festival devoted to the composer's works. As the gruesome stepfather Dom Magnifico, he had a natural sense of comic timing. Two British singers, Nicole Tibbels and Leah-Marian Jones, proved entertaining as the preening ugly sisters, with another Italian, Sonia Ganassi, in the title role. She had brilliant moments but seemed uncertain how to add flesh to this mouse-like role. Never mind. The production has charm and energy. It should be a box-office hit. Or see it on BBC2 on Boxing Day at 2.50pm. TV schedulers, a peculiar breed, seem to assume that socially inept music lovers, bereft of concerts, will have nothing to fill the long festive hours. Accordingly, they squeeze a year's worth of viewing into a long weekend. If you watched everything, you could certainly escape all other obligations. Here are some of the best: Choir of the Year (BBC2 today, 26 and 27 December); Glyndebourne's La Boh\u00e8me (Christmas Day, Channel 4); and an Alfred Brendel documentary (BBC2 Christmas Day). On New Year's Day, the new digital channel, Artsworld, shows the marvellous Cecilia Bartoli singing Vivaldi. Radio 3 is full of seasonal treats, including La Traviata Live from the Met on 30 December. And once you've tired of rissoles and r\u00e9chauff\u00e9s (genres not unknown to the opera world), you can watch Elijah Moshinsky's production of Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail filmed in Istanbul (BBC2, 29 December). Since the title was thought too daunting for TV viewers, they have plumped for a name which sounds like the ultimate seasonal dish: Mozart in Turkey.",

      "body": "<p><strong>January</strong> The millennium celebrations had been an anti-climax and the fuss about the Dome was starting. Our advice was to buy the IM group, led by Bob Edminston, a Midlands Christian fundamentalist who spent the back end of last year hyping Sir Cliff Richard's record Millennium Prayer to the top of the charts. </p> <p>Bob did his bit by placing large orders for the record with sneering assistants in Birmingham multiples and then watching the CD beat the pants off the infidel opposition. And we told you to sell all UK brewery and pub chain stocks on news that George Best had been ordered to give up drinking.</p> <p><strong>February</strong> The hot tip was the London Rubber Company (ie Durex) on news that the company had a legal battle gaining entry into the Japanese condom market, the biggest in the world. The wise investor takes a broad interest in the world and Trading Floor brought the news that the Japanese invented the first modern condom, known as the Kabutogata, in the nineteenth century. The Kabutogata was made of tortoiseshell. </p> <p>The LRC at the same time claimed the first-ever condoms were used 3,000 years ago in Egypt to protect the wearer from insect bites.</p> <p><strong>March</strong> Spring was in the air, along with talk of global warming. The team picked out companies likely to do well in a future tropical Britain, led by Rentokil. </p> <p>Early in the month the market slaughtered the stock, wiping \u00a3888 million off the company's value in a single day after disappointing results, ignoring long-term prospects, which were excellent, on news (in the same week) that a colony of wild spectacled cayman alligators now resident in Newcastle had become active again after the winter break. </p> <p>This followed the discovery of nests of Tunisian scorpions in Kent, venomous miniature Portuguese men-of-war in the tepid Bayou of the Norfolk Broads and the identification of rapine flocks of razor-beaked tropical parrots in Epping Forest. </p> <p><strong>April</strong> Keeping up the environmental theme, the tip of the month was to stockpile and sell on mountain ranges. The Clan MacLeod wanted a mere \u00a310m for the entire Black Cullin range on the Isle of Skye. At the same time Ben Nevis was sold for \u00a3450,000, the average price of a warehouse conversion in Docklands. </p> <p>In view of the booming demand for conveniently located second mountains, our advice to readers was to check behind the back of the mantelpiece clock to see if they owned all or part of a mountain and cash in while the going was good. But nobody, as far as we can now tell, did so and mountains remained sluggish and failed to peak all year.</p> <p><strong>May</strong> Hazards in the workplace was one theme in May, with advice to sell the Prudential and all other suppliers of medical insurance on official news that the workplace, and everywhere else, was a much more hazardous place than any sane person had previously thought. </p> <p>DTI figures revealed that 723 people had sustained injuries 'caused by accidents involving envelopes', 3,554 had turned up at accident and emergency departments with wounds 'attributable to flower pots' and no less than 37,048 had come to grief as a result of calamities 'related to the wearing of carpet slippers'. </p> <p>The number of people with toes stuck up bath taps or saucepans stuck on their heads was not reported - the figure presumably included under the heading of 'hurt while involved in no activity in particular' (439,000 cases). All very tragic. But it was hard to feel much sympathy with the 59 people who last year were 'injured by Blu-tak'. </p> <p><strong>June</strong> Anarchists and anti-globalisation campaigners rioted in the City as part of a Carnival Against Capitalism. They planted cannabis in the grounds of Parliament, spray-painted abuse on statues of military leaders and gave the statue of Winston Churchill a green Mohican hairstyle fashioned out of a sod of grass. </p> <p>In response, City workers avenged these insults by attacking the Glastonbury Festival under the heading of 'Carnival Against the Crusties'. Militant Capitalists, their minds ablaze with the inflamatory agit-prop rantings of Investors' Chronicle and Money Management, had already warmed up by digging up designated cycle paths and attacking statues of Gandhi, covering his head with non-biodegradable astroturf from the golf club. But the protest never materialised, possibly due to leaders having being hospitalised by Blu-tak mishaps (see May).</p> <p><strong>July</strong> The stock tip of the year was Wessex Water, which had worked out a way of taking away people's sewage, processing slightly and selling it back to them as garden fertilizer. Noting the huge success of businesses such as Sky TV and the pop music racket generally, the team observed: 'Dotcoms come and dotcoms go, you can't go wrong backing a business based on selling shite.'</p> <p><strong>August</strong> Big Brother was a sensation on TV and we advised buying Planet 24/Carlton on news that company kingpin Charlie Parsons had claimed the show was his intellectual property, worth millions. We printed the transcript of tapes proving that Parsons and former creative partner Janet Street-Porter might soon be claiming to have invented other things.</p> <p>Here are extracts from tape of their brainstorming Session: CP: 'What do you say we sort of think of a way of somehow connectin' up all the computers in, like, the Whole World so that they could all communicate with each other usin', y'know, advanced file transfer protocols and, whachamcallit, HTML, in sort of one big, vast inter-connected computer network, using satellites and modems and everything? </p> <p>JS-P: 'Well wicked, innit?' </p> <p>(Royalty claim: Total cash flows of world wide web and internet, to include all content and revenues accruing to associated businesses such as Microsoft and IBM).</p> <p><strong>September</strong> The month was dominated by panic-buying of petrol and mass hysteria leading to the hoarding of bread and other basic foodstuffs. </p> <p>Trading Floor did its bit to calm everyone down and strengthen the nation's nerve by printing the following on 24 September: 'Supplies of The Observer are running very low this weekend and many petrol stations, newsagents, etc may well run out some time this evening, particularly in the inner cities, outer suburbs and everywhere else. </p> <p>'And remember letter boxes, paper-rounds and so on cannot run on the Sunday Times unless fitted with a \"scrubbing out\" device to remove the many impurities, noxious gases and other types of poison. So don't be an Observer shortage crisis mug. Go out and buy 100 copies, stuff them in garage and smugly gloat as others get into fights and desperately try to steal copies from the emergency services. Pass it on.'</p> <p><strong>October</strong> Buy Bayer Inc, the world's leading supplier of blood and blood products to hospitals. The blood-supply wing of the company's UK branch, already owner of such brands as Glucobay, Kognate and Nimotop, could be about to soar in the wake of the impending arrival in the UK of the last living relative of the original Dracula - the equally impressively titled exiled Prince Ottomar Rudolphe Vlad Kretzulesco Dracula of Transylvania.</p> <p>Vlad current resides in Castle Dracula, Schenkendorf, Brandenburg in the former East Germany. He has done much public-spirited work helping to publicise the German blood donor service, presumably carried out between the hours of sundown and sunrise so as not to get in the way of his day job as an antiques dealer.</p> <p> He says that he wants to come to the UK in order to work for the blood transfusion service and because he is being persecuted by, of all people, neo-Nazi football hooligans.</p> <p><strong>November</strong> Hoarding, petrol crisis? Sell everything - on increasingly strong rumours, following the proposed total ban on workplace smoking, that the next and even more serious occupational hazard in the sights of the developed world's health bureaucrats is workplace working. </p> <p>Scientists have long suspected a link between work and both physical and mental fatigue, despite efforts in all sectors of the economy to reduce the total number of jobs. </p> <p>New types of 'low work' occupations, such as colour therapy, graphic design and management consultancy - hyped under the slogan 'all the flavour of a real job without the effort' - have become more popular in recent years.</p> <p>But even these elite jobs do little to curtail symptoms of habitual working, which experts say range from 'feeling a bit knackered'at the end of the day, through inexplicable desire to sit in traffic jams and leading, in millions of cases, to boney fingers, full-scale toxic shock and nervous breakdown. </p> <p>Even the increasingly large majority who have managed to quit working in the workplace (or who never took up the habit in the first place) face the danger of so-called passive working. This happens when somebody innocently pretending to read the Financial Times, trying out the colour combinations on their computer desktop or downloading massive quantities of hard-core pornography from the internet, is suddenly and inadvertently exposed to a work-related email or phone call, indirectly resulting from some inconsiderate colleague's selfish determination to do some work. </p> <p>Dentists, meanwhile, are the latest group to feel the ill effects of work en mass. It was reported last week that work is causing many to turn to alcohol and experience problems with sleep. The campaign to make workplace working illegal was further boosted by a report, published in the latest Journal of Electromagnetic Hazards, that 'a significant number' of people are allergic to microchips.</p> <p>The journal's editor, Simon Best, told a newspaper that sufferers can fall unconscious at any time. They are also plagued by nausea, blurred vision and migraines after contact with a computer. While it is true that many City dealing rooms have thrived for years on a work-free environment, doing far better when people stay on the golf course or remain trapped in their gites by French Direct Action, the effects of a ban overall are likely to be catastrophic.</p> <p><strong>December</strong> The end of the year brought the penultimate stock tip of the year, Pileofmud dotcom, the most innovative penny share since Amstrad. The value lies in the idea's simplicity. People simply punt their credit cards into cyberspace, and, hey presto, a pile of mud arrives at the door. The company offers various mud supply options, starting with a \u00a32.50p pauper's starter pack through a 'hippo' option to a 'deluxe executive service' involving the delivery of 500 kilos of mud (with a choice of topsoils). The whole thing is based on the premise that anyone stupid enough to buy anything over the internet would buy anything.</p> <p>* Led by famous economist and virtuoso international concert violinist Chris Horrie **Publisher's statement.

Militant Capitalists, their minds ablaze with the inflamatory agit-prop rantings of Investors' Chronicle and Money Management, had already warmed up by digging up designated cycle paths and attacking statues of Gandhi, covering his head with non-biodegradable astroturf from the golf club. But the protest never materialised, possibly due to leaders having being hospitalised by Blu-tak mishaps (see May). July The stock tip of the year was Wessex Water, which had worked out a way of taking away people's sewage, processing slightly and selling it back to them as garden fertilizer. Noting the huge success of businesses such as Sky TV and the pop music racket generally, the team observed: 'Dotcoms come and dotcoms go, you can't go wrong backing a business based on selling shite.' August Big Brother was a sensation on TV and we advised buying Planet 24/Carlton on news that company kingpin Charlie Parsons had claimed the show was his intellectual property, worth millions. We printed the transcript of tapes proving that Parsons and former creative partner Janet Street-Porter might soon be claiming to have invented other things. Here are extracts from tape of their brainstorming Session: CP: 'What do you say we sort of think of a way of somehow connectin' up all the computers in, like, the Whole World so that they could all communicate with each other usin', y'know, advanced file transfer protocols and, whachamcallit, HTML, in sort of one big, vast inter-connected computer network, using satellites and modems and everything? JS-P: 'Well wicked, innit?' (Royalty claim: Total cash flows of world wide web and internet, to include all content and revenues accruing to associated businesses such as Microsoft and IBM). September The month was dominated by panic-buying of petrol and mass hysteria leading to the hoarding of bread and other basic foodstuffs. Trading Floor did its bit to calm everyone down and strengthen the nation's nerve by printing the following on 24 September: 'Supplies of The Observer are running very low this weekend and many petrol stations, newsagents, etc may well run out some time this evening, particularly in the inner cities, outer suburbs and everywhere else. 'And remember letter boxes, paper-rounds and so on cannot run on the Sunday Times unless fitted with a \"scrubbing out\" device to remove the many impurities, noxious gases and other types of poison. So don't be an Observer shortage crisis mug. Go out and buy 100 copies, stuff them in garage and smugly gloat as others get into fights and desperately try to steal copies from the emergency services. Pass it on.' October Buy Bayer Inc, the world's leading supplier of blood and blood products to hospitals. The blood-supply wing of the company's UK branch, already owner of such brands as Glucobay, Kognate and Nimotop, could be about to soar in the wake of the impending arrival in the UK of the last living relative of the original Dracula - the equally impressively titled exiled Prince Ottomar Rudolphe Vlad Kretzulesco Dracula of Transylvania. Vlad current resides in Castle Dracula, Schenkendorf, Brandenburg in the former East Germany. He has done much public-spirited work helping to publicise the German blood donor service, presumably carried out between the hours of sundown and sunrise so as not to get in the way of his day job as an antiques dealer. He says that he wants to come to the UK in order to work for the blood transfusion service and because he is being persecuted by, of all people, neo-Nazi football hooligans. November Hoarding, petrol crisis? Sell everything - on increasingly strong rumours, following the proposed total ban on workplace smoking, that the next and even more serious occupational hazard in the sights of the developed world's health bureaucrats is workplace working. Scientists have long suspected a link between work and both physical and mental fatigue, despite efforts in all sectors of the economy to reduce the total number of jobs. New types of 'low work' occupations, such as colour therapy, graphic design and management consultancy - hyped under the slogan 'all the flavour of a real job without the effort' - have become more popular in recent years. But even these elite jobs do little to curtail symptoms of habitual working, which experts say range from 'feeling a bit knackered'at the end of the day, through inexplicable desire to sit in traffic jams and leading, in millions of cases, to boney fingers, full-scale toxic shock and nervous breakdown. Even the increasingly large majority who have managed to quit working in the workplace (or who never took up the habit in the first place) face the danger of so-called passive working. This happens when somebody innocently pretending to read the Financial Times, trying out the colour combinations on their computer desktop or downloading massive quantities of hard-core pornography from the internet, is suddenly and inadvertently exposed to a work-related email or phone call, indirectly resulting from some inconsiderate colleague's selfish determination to do some work. Dentists, meanwhile, are the latest group to feel the ill effects of work en mass. It was reported last week that work is causing many to turn to alcohol and experience problems with sleep. The campaign to make workplace working illegal was further boosted by a report, published in the latest Journal of Electromagnetic Hazards, that 'a significant number' of people are allergic to microchips. The journal's editor, Simon Best, told a newspaper that sufferers can fall unconscious at any time. They are also plagued by nausea, blurred vision and migraines after contact with a computer. While it is true that many City dealing rooms have thrived for years on a work-free environment, doing far better when people stay on the golf course or remain trapped in their gites by French Direct Action, the effects of a ban overall are likely to be catastrophic. December The end of the year brought the penultimate stock tip of the year, Pileofmud dotcom, the most innovative penny share since Amstrad. The value lies in the idea's simplicity. People simply punt their credit cards into cyberspace, and, hey presto, a pile of mud arrives at the door. The company offers various mud supply options, starting with a \u00a32.50p pauper's starter pack through a 'hippo' option to a 'deluxe executive service' involving the delivery of 500 kilos of mud (with a choice of topsoils). The whole thing is based on the premise that anyone stupid enough to buy anything over the internet would buy anything. * Led by famous economist and virtuoso international concert violinist Chris Horrie **Publisher's statement.

What of recent, lucid and imaginative books on philosophy and social science which teach these skills (while explaining the ruling Cartesian ideology that undermines them)? The cult of fiction, journalism and the novel over such books carries a heavy cost. A culture inept in assessing views and values is one hellbent not just on its own but our planet's destruction.
