      "body": "<p>&nbsp; So, the first couple of weeks organized, let my whistle-stop tour of Australia begin. Already I have seen and learnt so much it will be difficult to fit it all in. On Saturday, I was off at 6am for a day trip with Adventure Tours to Kakadu National Park in a four-wheel-drive bus. We made lots of stops on the way, to look at barammundi fish and a tall cathedral termite mound, and to take the Jumping Crocodile Cruise on the Adelaide River. Here, in the wet season,&nbsp; the crocodiles stay in the water instead of basking on the river banks where tourists can see them. To tempt them nearer, lumps of meat are hung on rods from the boat.&nbsp;This is limited to three lumps per trip, and if the crocs miss or there are more than three about, it's tough luck, as the park rangers don't want them to become dependant on this food supply. </p> <p>We were lucky enough to have four lumps, and a white&nbsp;sea eagle swooped down to take one in an awesome display of precision diving.&nbsp;Two crocs obligingly jumped&nbsp; to take their prize, but the third seemed to be more interested in eyeballing me as I was poised with camera ready. It was not until the boatman shouted a warning that I realised my elbow was actually out of the window - you've never seen an arm move so fast. Andy, our&nbsp;tour leader, seemed to have eagle eyes despite the fact that he was driving - he suddenly would stop the bus and turn round to show us a fan lizard&nbsp;with perfect camouflage on a tree trunk, a dingo lurking in the spear grass and even an olive python about 3m long - even he was excited at spotting this. </p> <p>We finally reached the Fogg Dam Conservation Reserve, an area made up of flooded wetlands which stretched as far as the eye could see and which were covered with an abundance of wading birds with all sorts of weird legs. After stopping at our overnight camp at Stuart Wilderness, we ventured into the soggy vine forest for a short walk - short partly because of the abundance of leeches and mosquitoes, but also because the skies suddenly opened in a torrential rain storm. We were all faced with a choice: run for shelter or get soaked while hosing down our feet and shoes to get rid of any leeches. The majority, me included, chose the latter. </p> <p>While waiting for the rain to stop we met Kevin and Ricky,&nbsp;our two Aborigine guides. They took us on a bush walk, showing us the various trees used by the Aborigines for food, fuel and drawing materials, and the&nbsp;woolybark and stringybark used to make didgeridoos.&nbsp;Standing several hundred metres apart, they demonstrated how they communicated by sign language. It was really interesting and they answered all our questions with patience and humour. That evening they put on a show of Aborigine singing, dancing and didgeridoo. &nbsp;I left the audience participation to the youngsters. </p> <p>Next day we were up at 6am and into Kakadu, many parts of which&nbsp;are flooded and inaccessible. We went up to Nourlangie Rock&nbsp;to see the Aboriginal rock paintings and the Cultural Centre, which was beautifully laid out and fascinating, then on to Gubara for a 6km walk which ended with a lovely swim at a waterfall. I had expected little tents&nbsp;with primitive cooking facilities at the camp site, and was pleasantly surprised at how civilised it all was, with permanent tents, showers, a fridge in the big communal kitchen tent and a power point to recharge the camera. </p> <p>There were 11 of us on the tour, all youngsters apart from me and an older Danish couple - a different type of traveller&nbsp;from those I had been meeting on the rest of my trip. These people were mostly just working/travelling/partying round Australia and New Zealand. There can't be many young people left in Ireland - they're all here.They all&nbsp; happily did the walks in an assortment of skirts, bikini tops and flip-flops, but they were good fun and full of questions and enthusiasm for all we saw. In the evening we played 'two truths and a lie', where you each make three statements, and everyone else has to guess which was the lie. Few got mine right.<br> 1) I was once kissed by Paul McCartney<br> 2) I once went out with a boy called Bertie Clack<br> 3) I once played cricket for Sussex Junior Ladies (answer at the end). <br>The next day involved more walking, stunning waterfalls and swimming in the Gimbat area. The most impressive waterfall was the Motorcar Falls. This area could only be reached by a four-wheel-drive as a couple of the roads were flooded and partially washed away. Several people tumbled out of their seats as we rock'n'rolled our way through - exciting stuff. </p> <p>And so we finally arrived back in Darwin, tired and grubby, but happy. Tuesday was spent sleeping, washing clothes and emailing off the group photo to everyone on the trip. I also hired a bike for a couple of hours to explore Darwin. I cycled along the coast and found myself&nbsp; at an extremely posh marina with luxury houses and yachts. I stopped for a beer, but nobody spoke to me. Maybe it was the hire bike, the scruffy shorts, the scabby knees (from a trip over Bali's unfinished pavements) or the plasters on my feet that gave me away as not belonging to the yachting set. </p> <p>The Kakadu trip came with a free day at Litchfield National&nbsp;Park which I&nbsp;took up on Wednesday. Litchfield is much smaller and less rugged&nbsp;than Kakadu, but very beautiful. It was another good&nbsp;day with walks to Wangi and Toher Falls and swimming&nbsp;at Buley Hole and Florence Falls. Our picnic lunch was invaded by 94 tourists off a cruise ship. I have never seen so much surplus flesh, and so many fancy sunhats or video cameras concentrated in one group before. </p> <p>And that was the end of my taste of&nbsp; the 'top end' of Australia - different again from all I have seen before. I'm glad I was there in the wet season with all the&nbsp;lush vegetation and amazing variety of wildlife. Thanks to Rosy, Graham, Jake and Theresa, Mark and Corina for all the tips. I have done my best but have missed loads. I am getting used to this upside-down land, where you can't tell the tourists from the residents, where the beer is served in bottles with polystyrene cups round them, where the $1 coin is&nbsp; bigger than the $2 one and everyone really does say 'no worries'&nbsp;in response&nbsp;to everything.&nbsp; Could you tell a saltie from a freshie if you met&nbsp;one in&nbsp;a billabong? I can now. I am writing a day early as I am off on a six-day tour to Alice Springs and Ayres Rock at 5.30am tomorrow. I will&nbsp; miss Sam, who I believe has just been there, but hope to meet up with Milly when I get to Sydney. I try to keep an eye on what they're up to, but time in net cafes is a bit hectic (I&nbsp;was in this one before 9am to catch their 'happy hour'). I'll be writing from Alice next week. If anyone has contact with my two sons will they tell them to write to their mother please - I haven't heard from either for a month! </p> <p>PS Answer: I was never kissed by Paul McCartney - although I did get a peck on the cheek from his brother, when Scaffold (who remembers Lily the Pink?) came to one of my student May balls...</p>",

Could you tell a saltie from a freshie if you met one in a billabong? I can now. I am writing a day early as I am off on a six-day tour to Alice Springs and Ayres Rock at 5.30am tomorrow. I will miss Sam, who I believe has just been there, but hope to meet up with Milly when I get to Sydney. I try to keep an eye on what they're up to, but time in net cafes is a bit hectic (I was in this one before 9am to catch their 'happy hour'). I'll be writing from Alice next week. If anyone has contact with my two sons will they tell them to write to their mother please - I haven't heard from either for a month! PS Answer: I was never kissed by Paul McCartney - although I did get a peck on the cheek from his brother, when Scaffold (who remembers Lily the Pink?) came to one of my student May balls...",

Norman Lamont stood up to deliver his Budget speech with the economy deep in recession, businesses going bankrupt in droves and unemployment heading rapidly towards 3m. Yet, Lamont had one trump to play. He announced a tax cut in the form of a new 20% band of income tax, thereby setting the terms of the economic debate in the election campaign that was launched by John Major the very next day.</p> <p>This was the way things were during the long Conservative hegemony. As an election loomed, the chancellor would cut taxes and tie his Labour opponent up in knots by challenging him to match the reductions pound for pound.</p> <p>The real political significance of Gordon Brown's address yesterday was that it turned the orthodoxy of the past 20 years on its head. One thing is certain: whenever the election is held, it will not turn into a Dutch auction on tax. Instead, it will be up to the Conservatives either to match Labour's 3.7% increases in public spending in each of the next three years or to say where they expect to make savings. All the signs suggest that William Hague and Michael Portillo will have just as much trouble convincing the voters that their plans add up as did Neil Kinnock and John Smith did in 1992.</p> <p>Naturally, the picture is a bit more complex than this. Despite the extra money for schools and hospitals, the biggest single winner from yesterday's package was the road lobby, a rather inconvenient fact in the light of the prime minister's \"greening of Britain\" pledge on Tuesday. Nor is Brown's political victory complete. He may have rehabilitated the idea of higher public spending, but he has not even attempted to do the same for tax.</p> <p>But the environmental damage caused by caving in to the road lobby will not be evident for some time, and higher tax is not an issue that political parties care to talk about when polling day is probably less than two months away. The real point of the Budget was to set the terms of combat for the election and that Brown has done. Unlike previous Labour chancellors, he has not presided over economic disaster or humiliation; indeed, the first chunk of his speech was given over to a familiar litany of achievement - lowest inflation, interest rates and unemployment in decades. There have been no devaluations, no visits from the International Monetary Fund, no crisis measures. The squeeze on spending came early, not late.</p> <p>The benign state of the economy is not all the chancellor's doing. He was at pains yesterday to paint a black picture of the country on the day Labour came to power, but the reality was that he had the finest inheritance of any Labour chancellor. The economy was already doing well when the Conservatives left office, and through a mixture of luck and skill Brown has ensured that it has stayed that way. Had Kenneth Clarke still been at the Treasury, he too would have had barrowloads of money with which to cut taxes or increase spending.</p> <p>But by securing a reputation for economic competence, Brown has been able to shift economic priorities in two distinct ways. The increases in spending on health and education over the next three years were large enough even without the top-ups announced yesterday, although they needed to be after the austerity of the first two years. The fact that some of the money is to be used for recruitment and retention drives in the NHS and in education is evidence of the problems caused by sticking to the spending plans laid down by Clarke ahead of the 1997 election. There is a lot more to do in a second term.</p> <p>Second, Brown has been able to make the tax and benefit system more progressive, a stark difference from the consistently regressive trend between 1979 and 1997. A lot of the rhetoric of New Labour has been about its new-found admiration for risk-taking entrepreneurs, but the beneficiaries of fiscal policy have been those at the bottom of the income scale. The national minimum wage, the working families tax credit, reductions in income tax and national insurance contributions and the increases to child benefit and income-related benefit have helped the poor far more than the rich.</p> <p>According to the Treasury's budget red book, every group of working age households has gained as a result of Labour's five Budgets since 1997. But whereas the richest 10% are better off by around \u00a32 a week, the poorest 10% of working age households are almost \u00a320 a week better off. The second poorest 10% of households are doing even better, because more of them are in work, and Brown's tax credits have been aimed at the working poor.</p> <p>Will middle England swallow all this? They will provided interest rates stay low, and Brown's decision to spare drinkers and smokers higher excise duties will drive down inflation and keep pressure on the Bank to cut interest rates even though demand is being expanded. Cute that. Very cute.</p> <p><b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>Comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Cast your mind back nine long years. Norman Lamont stood up to deliver his Budget speech with the economy deep in recession, businesses going bankrupt in droves and unemployment heading rapidly towards 3m. Yet, Lamont had one trump to play. He announced a tax cut in the form of a new 20% band of income tax, thereby setting the terms of the economic debate in the election campaign that was launched by John Major the very next day. This was the way things were during the long Conservative hegemony. As an election loomed, the chancellor would cut taxes and tie his Labour opponent up in knots by challenging him to match the reductions pound for pound. The real political significance of Gordon Brown's address yesterday was that it turned the orthodoxy of the past 20 years on its head. One thing is certain: whenever the election is held, it will not turn into a Dutch auction on tax. Instead, it will be up to the Conservatives either to match Labour's 3.7% increases in public spending in each of the next three years or to say where they expect to make savings. All the signs suggest that William Hague and Michael Portillo will have just as much trouble convincing the voters that their plans add up as did Neil Kinnock and John Smith did in 1992. Naturally, the picture is a bit more complex than this. Despite the extra money for schools and hospitals, the biggest single winner from yesterday's package was the road lobby, a rather inconvenient fact in the light of the prime minister's \"greening of Britain\" pledge on Tuesday. Nor is Brown's political victory complete. He may have rehabilitated the idea of higher public spending, but he has not even attempted to do the same for tax. But the environmental damage caused by caving in to the road lobby will not be evident for some time, and higher tax is not an issue that political parties care to talk about when polling day is probably less than two months away. The real point of the Budget was to set the terms of combat for the election and that Brown has done. Unlike previous Labour chancellors, he has not presided over economic disaster or humiliation; indeed, the first chunk of his speech was given over to a familiar litany of achievement - lowest inflation, interest rates and unemployment in decades.

For there is a smell of death about the Tory party.</p> <p>Mr Hague decided to apply the electrodes and bring his monster twitching back to life. It was a difficult job but he made a good effort. Mr Brown had always listed his tax cuts in the Budget speech, but left others to find the tax rises in the small print. \"He is the thief who steals your car then comes back in the morning to return your hubcaps,\" he said.</p> <p>\"You can't fool all of the people all of the time, but you can fool all Labour MPs on Budget day,\" he went on. Quite right. Fooling your own party is a chancellor's most important job, and Mr Brown did it very well.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Hague cheered his own party up mightily. It will not do good in the long run, but he must have enjoyed it yesterday.</p> <p><b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>Comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

He sat down to loud applause from his own lot and morose, morbid silence from the others. For there is a smell of death about the Tory party. Mr Hague decided to apply the electrodes and bring his monster twitching back to life. It was a difficult job but he made a good effort. Mr Brown had always listed his tax cuts in the Budget speech, but left others to find the tax rises in the small print. \"He is the thief who steals your car then comes back in the morning to return your hubcaps,\" he said. \"You can't fool all of the people all of the time, but you can fool all Labour MPs on Budget day,\" he went on. Quite right. Fooling your own party is a chancellor's most important job, and Mr Brown did it very well. Meanwhile, Mr Hague cheered his own party up mightily. It will not do good in the long run, but he must have enjoyed it yesterday.

The Breadline Europe study, led by academics from Bristol University and the London School of Economics, was based on a social exclusion survey in September 1999, six months after the government began its anti-poverty drive. Ministers had dismissed previous research showing that numbers in poverty grew over the first two years of the Labour government. They said the position would improve after introduction of the minimum wage and working families tax credit - bringing 1.2m children and 800,000 adults out of poverty by April 2002 and abolishing child poverty completely by 2020. But time lags in the official data will force the government to go into the next election without hard evidence to demonstrate progress. The key official poverty indicator, dating from a survey in 1998, will show there were 14m adults in households with less than half average income.

The study showed dramatic increases in extreme forms of poverty across eastern Europe over the past 10 years, but the figures could not be compared directly with the UK. Simon Clarke, professor of sociology at Warwick university, said over 60% of Russians were living in poverty in 1998. \"Over a quarter were in extreme poverty, with incomes of less than half that required to acquire basic means of subsistence.

It is most unlikely that this deft advance would have been achieved without the influence of a secretary of state for culture.</p> <p>Yet news has emerged that the government may be planning to abolish the department and pass the creative industries - cinema, pop music and broadcasting, as well as the arts - into the tender care of the huge Department of Trade and Industry and the DfEE. The arts, which have gained a place in so many aspects of national life in recent years, are important \"earners\", but to place creativity alongside manufacturing industry in this way could only result in a huge loss of impact.</p> <p>In the 60s, the Labour minister Jennie Lee cared passionately about the arts and became their legendary spokesman. However, hers was not a Cabinet position. When John Major created the Department of National Heritage in 1992, the arts minister finally crossed that Rubicon. The Tory years saw real progress, such as Virginia Bottomley's imaginative scheme to designate some regional museum collections as of national importance.</p> <p>Then in 1997 the department was redefined and renamed. There have since been huge advances both in funding and in the place of culture in society. We see evidence of this change every day at Tate Modern where thanks to Chris Smith's commitment to free admission the national collections are evidently being enjoyed by tens of thousands of people who have never before been art enthusiasts or gallery visitors.</p> <p>The term \"National Heritage\" had suggested a primary concern with preserving the past. But the present government has encouraged contemporary culture and when last week Tony Blair held a seminar on creativity in Britain, the discussion showed that the arts are increasingly a factor in the life of many different communities. The recent decision to publish a green paper on creativity in 2010, alongside policy papers on education, health and crime is further evidence of a wish to make the arts part of the \"core script\". Culture influences education, health, employment and national income. But if it does not remain a discrete entity within government, its more subtle concerns will be doubtless be marginalised.</p> <p>The pity is that this proposal has emerged at a time when there has been real progress in the government's drive to widen access to the arts, with much of the momentum being due to the personal influence of Chris Smith. Can we really believe that he will be the last secretary of state for culture?</p> <p>The closing of the VAT loophole for museums announced yesterday has not emerged out of the blue.

It would have been easy to have abandoned this tradition, for which Britain has been widely admired, in the face of \"the new realities\" of multi-channel broadcasting.</p> <p>Yet the role of arts and culture in our society remains difficult to define in conventional terms. Frequently it is misunderstood or misrepresented but we can all point to examples of the humanising influence in creating shared experience and a shared sense of community in modern society. Our European counterparts take it for granted that culture has a natural place in government.</p> <p>Of course, film, pop music and broadcasting have emerged as key foreign earners, a fact acknowledged by the plan to hive them off to the DTI. However, to justify artistic activity mainly in terms of the economy does not take into account all the other benefits that flow from the energy of our musicians, designers, architects, artists and performers.</p> <p>Increasingly, the secretary of state has found new money and has been able to argue that the arts play a part in education, should play a greater role in broadcasting, contribute to the environment, help reduce crime in urban areas and improve the life of those in hospital. It is increasingly recognised that the arts can have a meaning for all communities in every section of society. The department's emphasis on both making the best available to people, and looking for new ways of reaching audiences, has begun to have a profound impact.

Yet the role of arts and culture in our society remains difficult to define in conventional terms. Frequently it is misunderstood or misrepresented but we can all point to examples of the humanising influence in creating shared experience and a shared sense of community in modern society. Our European counterparts take it for granted that culture has a natural place in government. Of course, film, pop music and broadcasting have emerged as key foreign earners, a fact acknowledged by the plan to hive them off to the DTI. However, to justify artistic activity mainly in terms of the economy does not take into account all the other benefits that flow from the energy of our musicians, designers, architects, artists and performers. Increasingly, the secretary of state has found new money and has been able to argue that the arts play a part in education, should play a greater role in broadcasting, contribute to the environment, help reduce crime in urban areas and improve the life of those in hospital. It is increasingly recognised that the arts can have a meaning for all communities in every section of society. The department's emphasis on both making the best available to people, and looking for new ways of reaching audiences, has begun to have a profound impact. This work must be continued.

      "body": "<p>Back in the early 1980s at the height of Labour's civil war, Sir Keith Joseph, the architect of Thatcherism, confided to fellow Tory Norman Lamont that \"one day there will be a Labour government that believes in capitalism, and that will be our greatest achievement\". </p> <p>As William Hague sat listening to Gordon Brown's Budget speech yesterday afternoon he could have been forgiven for thinking that Sir Keith's achievement was his biggest stumbling block on the road to Downing Street. Every leader of the opposition has trouble responding cold to the Budget speech, but for Mr Hague the problem was more acute than for most. As far as both the markets and the voters are concerned, Labour now offers the same sort of anti-inflationary and low tax environment that the Tories used to offer - only under Brown they have done it better. </p> <p>Brown has become Labour's philosopher king, just as Nigel Lawson came to define Thatcherism's tenets. And as Lawson's stature sometimes led to uncomfortable relations with the lady next door, so the Brown-Blair alliance has seen its share of strains. Brown also shares with Lawson a fundamental conviction about how modern economies work: governments should concentrate less on pumping up demand and more on getting the supply side right. Under Brown's guidance, Labour has fully embraced the market, privatisation and low taxation. No clearer sign of how Labour thinking has changed is that Brown's first act in office was to establish an independent Bank of England. In 1945, Labour's first economic policy was to nationalise it. </p> <p><strong> Prudence for a purpose</strong><br> </p> <p> The emergence of \"Iron Gordon\" has won plaudits from financial markets and rightwing commentators. But the chancellor has always said that \"prudence is for a purpose\" and designed to enable him to deliver traditional leftwing goals of redistribution. This has been controversial and sometimes politically damaging to his own party. But it is nothing to the headache it has given the Tories who, despite four shadow chancellors in as many years, have yet to come up with an answer. </p> <p>As Lord Howe, Margaret Thatcher's first chancellor, explains, Labour's acceptance of the economic principles that shaped the Thatcherite philosophy compares with the Conservative party's decision to live with the welfare state. The Brown approach, he says, creates difficulties for Mr Hague because having defined the common ground, the Tories have now had it stolen from them. \"We did what [Labour's Clement] Attlee did in 1945. He redefined the common ground and Rab Butler had to persuade the Conservative party to move on to it. Blair, perhaps more clearly than Brown, saw the need to move on to our common ground. </p> <p>\"But it makes it much harder for the people who have been designing it [to respond]. They tend to want to move still further to the right. It is a temptation for the 'no turning back group' to become the 'bash on regardless group'. I am sure that is not the right way to go.\" </p> <p>Labour's manifestos trace its ideological shift over the past two decades; politically inevitable, given the scale of its landslide defeats in 1983 and 1987 and John Major's against the odds victory during the slump of 1992. The extent to which the political tide was running against Labour's traditional platform - a mixed economy, centralised control of nationalised industries and, among some members of the party, Keynesian demand management - is recalled by Lord Young, secretary of state for trade and industry in the 1980s. He relates the story of an American futurologist predicting in 1975 that the two European countries with the lowest standard of living in the year 2000 would be Albania and Britain. \"We did change the world,\" he said. \"The UK, which was the sick man of Europe, became the healthy man of Europe. There were three reasons. We gave the unions back to their members, reduced taxes and encouraged management to manage, and privatised. I remember Mrs Thatcher saying: 'The test of whether we have succeeded will be when all the entrepreneurial Britons come home'. In the 1980s they did. </p> <p>\"Mrs Thatcher's final victory was Tony Blair. Perhaps not so much Tony Blair but the acceptance [by Labour] that we have to have a competitive market economy. I genuinely felt in the 1987 that the outcome of that election would transform the life of the country. If we went with Neil Kinnock and the 1987 manifesto we would have been going back to where we were in the 1970s.\" </p> <p><strong> Emerging differences</strong><br> </p> <p> Another former Tory chancellor, Lord Lamont, takes a rather different view. He believes Brown does have a distinct idea about what he wants to do with the credibility he has won by his tough macroeconomic stewardship. \"What Gordon wants is to be the chancellor who solved the poverty trap\", he says. This is where the real distinction between New Labour and Thatcherism has become clearer. Under the Conservatives the price of driving down inflation and making British industry more competitive was an explosion in inequality and an increase in relative poverty. Brown's policies have concentrated both on making business more productive, so far with scant success, and with quiet, but extensive redistribution. The minimum wage, the working families tax credit, the children's tax credit, increases in child benefit, and the minimum pension guarantee, have all been aimed at those at the bottom end of the income scale. Means testing has become much more prevalent, but bodies such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies say that benefits for the less well off have become more generous. </p> <p>John Monks, the general secretary of the TUC, is one of those who gets impatient when people say Brown is a Tory in disguise. \"He has been very successful. Look at the government's record on unemployment and inflation. He might have had some luck but everyone is entitled to a little luck. I think there has been a real difference. </p> <p>\"It may not have been all that clear for the first two years when he was sticking to [Tory] spending plans. Now he is releasing more money for areas such as health and education. I think he has done very well. He does not look at all like a Tory chancellor now.\" </p> <p>This is where Brown's Conservative admirers start to have their doubts. They like Iron Gordon, but are getting a bit worried about a \"Red Gordon\" lurking in the shadows. \"I don't think it makes an sense to go from famine to feast,\" says Lord Lamont. \"There has been very strict control on public spending that I don't believe the Conservative party would have achieved - followed by 8% growth which is ludicrously high. I doubt if the public sector can cope. This is a tax and spend government. You are getting the tax first and the spending later.\" </p> <p>Business, too, is starting to have one or two misgivings. There are concerns about higher public spending crowding out private sector investment and about the increasing regulatory burden. </p> <p>Sir Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil Initial and a former president of the CBI, is complimentary about Brown's handling of the big picture, but warns: \"I think business is concerned that public spending as a proportion of GDP may well rise substantially because of the chancellor's plans for the future.\" </p> <p>The sharpest criticisms of Mr Brown's handling of both the macroeconomy and the supply side come from his immediate predecessor, Kenneth Clarke, even though to an unjaundiced observer the policies of the two men display a great deal of continuity. But when he arrived in office, Brown rubbished Clarke, and Clarke now has no compunction about returning the favour. \"When I was in office we were able to boast we had the fastest growth of the major western European economies. Gordon has not been able to repeat that boast.\" </p> <p>Clarke has two big gripes. The first is that the Bank of England has been needlessly hawkish, creating an over-strong pound which has damaged manufacturing industry and agriculture. The second is the erratic way public finances have been handled, according to Clarke. </p> <p>\"There have been three lean years to be followed by four fat ones. He had no reason to squeeze public spending so ferociously for the first years. He cut the overall level of public spending by 0.5% in each of the first two years. Public spending is the lowest proportion of GDP since the 1960s. Now for four years were are going to get the highest rates of spending we have seen since the war. The government can't make its mind up. Sometimes it surprises by the extent to which it introduces private sector disciplines into the public sector, the next minute it is intervening in areas of the economy where it is not competent to do so.\" </p> <p>But as Clarke admits, he found it utterly impossible in 1997 to convince the voters that Labour posed a threat to their living standards. Four years and five Budgets later, Mr Hague is struggling to do better, knowing all the time that oppositions do not win elections, governments do lose them. </p> <p> <strong>The Budget in detail</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><strong>Interactive</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><strong>Comment</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><strong>Audio</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><strong>Game</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><strong>Photo gallery</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><strong>Quiz</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><strong>What does it mean for me?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><strong>Public sector Budget analysis</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><strong>Chancellors</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><strong>Special reports</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The IRA today agreed to reopen negotiations on disarmament as Tony Blair launched a major new bid to end the deadlock threatening the future of the Northern Ireland peace process. The provisionals said they were prepared to have talks with General John de Chastelain's decommissioning body for the first time since June last year, but demanded the government deliver on promises on policing and demilitarisation. The IRA's announcement came just before the prime minister and the republic's taoiseach Bertie Ahern started a series of meetings with Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams at Hillsborough Castle near Belfast. Mr Blair and Mr Ahern met first before breaking off for a series of one-to-one meetings with Mr Trimble, Mr Adams and the deputy first minister, Seamus Mallon. Sinn Fein are resisting Ulster Unionist demands to begin emptying their arms dumps, and Mr Blair is under huge republican pressure to start clearing the south Armagh countryside of military surveillance towers. More importantly, the republicans want him to make significant changes in government plans for future police arrangements in Northern Ireland. The IRA said they remained committed to lasting peace but insisted all sides needed to play their part, including the British government. Ulster Unionists immediately dismissed the announcement as an attempt by the IRA to cover their backs if today's talks break up without any significant progress. But republicans believe it could allow the sides inside Hillsborough Castle today some more negotiating space. The reopening of negotiations between the IRA and General de Chastelain is certain to increase pressure on Mr Trimble to lift the ban on Sinn Fein's two Stormont ministers, Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brun, from attending north-south ministerial meetings. Mr Trimble emerged from the talks describing the IRA statement as a \"pre-emptive strike\".

Flowers were thrown, opposition cabbages didn't even reach the stage. Now he retires to the dressing room to prepare for Act Two. Meanwhile the audience contemplates his grand opus so far, wondering what comes next.</p> <p>This last great performance gave us the chancellor in red mode, poor children's friend, the stealth-taxing secret socialist. No other word but redistribution describes how the money has flowed towards the poorest with a little taken from the top. Why, even his henchmen now use the wicked R-word once banned from New Labour's lexicon. Average and poorer families were again the target of his munificence, new mothers, child care, paternity leave - a budget for poorer women, so a new mother will be \u00a32,240 a year better off. Another 170,000 children will be lifted above poverty levels. And as more billions poured in for hospitals, schools, drug treatment, urban regeneration and myriad good causes - free museums, films, dilapidated churches, sports clubs - that now familiar Brown budget wonderment struck again.</p> <p>For who could imagine a Labour chancellor with \u00a316bn in his pocket, inflation licked, national debt and interest rates down, full employment within grasp? All pensioners (who claim) are in April lifted out of poverty - an unthinkable promise back in 1997, almost as extraordinary as ending child poverty. There has never been so big a step up for the poor. As for the rest? Good times brought jam to every social slice - 4% higher consumer spending each year, average living standards up rosily, mortgages an average \u00a31,200 cheaper, growth outstripping all predictions. Happy days and the best is yet to come, as the public spending jam rolls out in earnest now.</p> <p>So there are red roses aplenty for red Gordon. He has turned the political debate away from tax cuts - there were none, only extra credits for the poor. That was a crucial test of his nerve. How tempting with so much cash to knock another 1p off pre-election income tax. It was a 1999 error not repeated because it didn't need to be. Labour has gained in confidence since then and the public mood is with them - pressing for spending, not for tax cuts.</p> <p>This chancellor congratulates himself on long-termism, but after an excellent first act, the end of his story is still unknown, judgment too early to make. For all the feel-good glow each of his budgets brings, there remains the big long-term question. Will he effect a fundamental and long-term shift in Britain's tax and spend regime? The year 2003-2004 is the crunch by which time the spending now laid out must have delivered undeniable results in health, education and transport - with public services proud, well-paid and thrusting ahead for all to see. Current public patience will run out by then. Tory posters reading \"You paid the cash, so where are the nurses/teachers ...\" and so on make people snort with scorn at Tory cheek now - but not by then if change is not everywhere about to be seen. As people get yearly richer, so expectations of public services rise too. Never before has a Labour government produced increases in public investment above trend growth, and yet the big picture is still a history of under-spending.</p> <p>If it turns out that Act One was as good as it ever gets, then this first term was not enough. If recession rolls in on a dark tide from across the Atlantic, then we will look back and wonder how Labour did so little when the times were extraordinarily good. Why so timid, why so slow? The chancellor may have ended boom-and-bust but what we had instead in public spending was bust-and-boom. The depth of that bust is becoming ever more apparent: the price of prudence was painfully high. It will now not be until 2003-4 that Britain returns to the same level of public spending as a proportion of GDP that it inherited in 1997. A killer fact.</p> <p>Of course it is not quite as simple as that. Within that total, the huge sums previously wasted on unemployment and debt interest have been redistributed to excellent effect. But none the less, over any length of time, the amount a country taxes and spends defines fairly accurately the quality of its public service. We will still not be spending nearly enough. It was Tony Blair himself who promised NHS spending would meet the EU average, thus drawing attention to the yawning gap between Europe and Britain in every other public sphere as well. The disastrous failure to spend in 2000 - with a massive \u00a35bn capital undershoot - accidentally added to the time of famine, delaying results.</p> <p>Another killer fact is that, despite the quite radical redistribution by government, the gap between the rich and poor has still widened under Labour. It always happens in prosperous times, but Labour made no attempt to claw back any of the extra income flowing in to top earners - let alone taxing their growing capital wealth. Indeed, capital gains and inheritance taxes have shrunk to insignificance. Let the Tories grumble about Labour's \"45 new stealth taxes\", the big picture is still that the rich are getting richer faster than the rest and the poor are still being left behind.</p> <p>The ongoing comedy of Conservative policy - made not so much on the hoof as in the Magimix - gives Labour the chance to confront the tax question head on. William Hague, excited by George Bush's trillion dollar promise, now says he will make a mind-boggling \u00a3114bn tax cut. Suddenly lurching for a wild west alternative, the Tories now oblige Labour to talk honestly about tax. But an open advocacy of virtuous taxation has always been noticeably lacking in every Gordon Brown budget speech. He has extinguished public demand for tax cuts, but that's only half the battle. Hague's axe-man cuts require a broad and principled case to be made positively for taxes: they are not a \"burden\" if they buy the things that people want.</p> <p>Praise of public wealth can face down the Tory nostrum that we each spend our own money better than the government does. If Labour's 10-year plans work as well as intended, there will be good evidence that public money well-spent buys much more collectively than citizens can each buy individually. But such words never spring easily to the chancellor's lips. This was a prudent budget - no horse-frightening in the City before an election. But future budgets need more radical shifts. Too often New Labour appeases and buys off opposing forces: this third-way strategy makes few friends or permanent changes. Long-term security for a left of centre government comes from persuading the public of the case for higher taxes - not from stealth or subterfuge. On taxes the people will not be fooled for long, but they might be persuaded to pay more.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;polly.toynbee@theguardian.com&quot;\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>Comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor's final budget brought the curtain down on the end of New Labour, Act One with a mighty confident flourish. Flowers were thrown, opposition cabbages didn't even reach the stage. Now he retires to the dressing room to prepare for Act Two. Meanwhile the audience contemplates his grand opus so far, wondering what comes next. This last great performance gave us the chancellor in red mode, poor children's friend, the stealth-taxing secret socialist. No other word but redistribution describes how the money has flowed towards the poorest with a little taken from the top. Why, even his henchmen now use the wicked R-word once banned from New Labour's lexicon. Average and poorer families were again the target of his munificence, new mothers, child care, paternity leave - a budget for poorer women, so a new mother will be \u00a32,240 a year better off. Another 170,000 children will be lifted above poverty levels. And as more billions poured in for hospitals, schools, drug treatment, urban regeneration and myriad good causes - free museums, films, dilapidated churches, sports clubs - that now familiar Brown budget wonderment struck again. For who could imagine a Labour chancellor with \u00a316bn in his pocket, inflation licked, national debt and interest rates down, full employment within grasp?

      "body": "<p>Gordon Brown yesterday put Labour on course for a resounding victory in a spring general election with a mixture of tax cuts and spending increases adding up to the most generous Budget giveaway since the late 1980s.</p> <p>Although drivers were the biggest single gainers from the \u00a35bn-plus package, the chancellor tried to set the tone for the forthcoming poll by boosting spending on schools and hospitals - and then challenging the Conservatives to match the increases.</p> <p>However, he also sought to hedge his bets with a three-pronged approach: \u00a32bn to appease last autumn's fuel protesters with reductions in petrol and diesel duties and cheaper excise licences, slightly less than \u00a32bn on tax cuts mainly aimed at those on low incomes, and \u00a31.8bn on higher public spending. All taxpayers will benefit from the widening of the 10p income tax band.</p> <p>The chancellor said his package, the most generous since Nigel Lawson's 1988 Budget, could be afforded because the strength of the economy had given him scope to spend more and tax less while maintaining his pledge to repay government debt at record levels.</p> <p>Tory MPs sat in stunned silence as Mr Brown's 52-minute speech painted a golden economic picture - in which inflation, interest rates and unemployment were at their lowest in a generation - and sought to underpin Labour's already huge opinion poll lead by offering help to a broad range of groups from smokers and drinkers to churches and sports clubs. The chancellor promised \u00a31bn for inner-city renovation, VAT changes to permit free museum access, and extra help for Britain's film industry. He also abolished tax on gambling.</p> <p>Rejecting William Hague's call for spending to be lower in order to finance across-the-board tax cuts, Mr Brown said: \"Our priority has been and is Britain's public services. We will not cut investment but raise it.\"</p> <p>Arguing that Conservative plans would result in spending cuts of up to \u00a316bn a year, the chancellor added: \"I have rejected this course for Britain's future not only because such deep cuts would move us from our long-term goals, and put hospitals at risk, but also because Britain must not repeat the short-termist mistakes of the 1980s: unfunded, unaffordable tax cuts, higher interest rates, cuts in necessary investment.\"</p> <p>The chancellor targeted his tax cuts at the less well-off. A \u00a35-a-week increase in the value of the working families tax credit, a boost from \u00a38.50 to \u00a310 in the new children's tax credit, together with an increase in the band at which income tax is levied at 10%, will leave a married couple with one earner and one child up to \u00a31,200 a year better off if they are in the lower income groups. The same family with an annual income of more than \u00a3100,000 will be \u00a3132 a year better off.</p> <p>Increases for health, education and crime-fighting mean real rises in public spending of 3.7% a year over the next three years, even higher than the 3.4% rises announced last summer. Although some City analysts said the overall size of the package was at the top end of what the economy could tolerate, reaction in the markets was muted. The Bank of England has the chance to give an instant verdict on the Budget today when it announces its latest decision on interest rates.</p> <p>Mr Hague tore into the government as best as he could, complaining that the tax burden had risen from from 35.2% in 1996-7 to 38.2% this year. He accused Mr Brown of being the \"10p up, 1p down chancellor\" who had raised taxes by \u00a328bn since 1997 - the equivalent of 10p on income tax. Mr Hague said the chancellor was like a thief \"who steals your car and comes back next day to return your hub caps\".</p> <p>Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, and his Treasury spokesman, Matthew Taylor, took the opposite view, complaining of missed chances for higher spending on key services.</p> <p>However, the chancellor's display of Labour's firepower prompted some MPs to predict that - despite the foot and mouth crisis - Tony Blair will not wait for a May 3 election, but call one almost immediately for April 5.</p> <p>The chancellor announced an extra \u00a31bn for headteachers - up to \u00a315,000 for every school - and another \u00a31bn for hospitals, between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a31m per trust, in the fight to restore long-neglected services.</p> <p>An additional \u00a3300m will be allocated over three years to help communities fight drug-related crime.</p> <p>Mr Brown described his Budget as a response to a century in which the needs of children had been ignored. He announced \u00a3500m for an expansion of paid maternity and paternity leave and \u00a31.2bn targeted at children in the poorest families - including a \u00a31,000 \"baby credit\" from 2002.</p> <p>Officials were less keen to emphasise the \u00a31.9bn worth of cuts in petrol and vehicle taxes on smaller cars and lorries which Mr Brown confirmed after \"consulation\" since last November when militant hauliers were threatening renewed blockades if ministers did not heed their plight.</p> <p><b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>Comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown yesterday put Labour on course for a resounding victory in a spring general election with a mixture of tax cuts and spending increases adding up to the most generous Budget giveaway since the late 1980s. Although drivers were the biggest single gainers from the \u00a35bn-plus package, the chancellor tried to set the tone for the forthcoming poll by boosting spending on schools and hospitals - and then challenging the Conservatives to match the increases. However, he also sought to hedge his bets with a three-pronged approach: \u00a32bn to appease last autumn's fuel protesters with reductions in petrol and diesel duties and cheaper excise licences, slightly less than \u00a32bn on tax cuts mainly aimed at those on low incomes, and \u00a31.8bn on higher public spending. All taxpayers will benefit from the widening of the 10p income tax band. The chancellor said his package, the most generous since Nigel Lawson's 1988 Budget, could be afforded because the strength of the economy had given him scope to spend more and tax less while maintaining his pledge to repay government debt at record levels. Tory MPs sat in stunned silence as Mr Brown's 52-minute speech painted a golden economic picture - in which inflation, interest rates and unemployment were at their lowest in a generation - and sought to underpin Labour's already huge opinion poll lead by offering help to a broad range of groups from smokers and drinkers to churches and sports clubs. The chancellor promised \u00a31bn for inner-city renovation, VAT changes to permit free museum access, and extra help for Britain's film industry. He also abolished tax on gambling. Rejecting William Hague's call for spending to be lower in order to finance across-the-board tax cuts, Mr Brown said: \"Our priority has been and is Britain's public services. We will not cut investment but raise it.\" Arguing that Conservative plans would result in spending cuts of up to \u00a316bn a year, the chancellor added: \"I have rejected this course for Britain's future not only because such deep cuts would move us from our long-term goals, and put hospitals at risk, but also because Britain must not repeat the short-termist mistakes of the 1980s: unfunded, unaffordable tax cuts, higher interest rates, cuts in necessary investment.\" The chancellor targeted his tax cuts at the less well-off. A \u00a35-a-week increase in the value of the working families tax credit, a boost from \u00a38.50 to \u00a310 in the new children's tax credit, together with an increase in the band at which income tax is levied at 10%, will leave a married couple with one earner and one child up to \u00a31,200 a year better off if they are in the lower income groups. The same family with an annual income of more than \u00a3100,000 will be \u00a3132 a year better off. Increases for health, education and crime-fighting mean real rises in public spending of 3.7% a year over the next three years, even higher than the 3.4% rises announced last summer. Although some City analysts said the overall size of the package was at the top end of what the economy could tolerate, reaction in the markets was muted. The Bank of England has the chance to give an instant verdict on the Budget today when it announces its latest decision on interest rates. Mr Hague tore into the government as best as he could, complaining that the tax burden had risen from from 35.2% in 1996-7 to 38.2% this year. He accused Mr Brown of being the \"10p up, 1p down chancellor\" who had raised taxes by \u00a328bn since 1997 - the equivalent of 10p on income tax. Mr Hague said the chancellor was like a thief \"who steals your car and comes back next day to return your hub caps\". Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, and his Treasury spokesman, Matthew Taylor, took the opposite view, complaining of missed chances for higher spending on key services. However, the chancellor's display of Labour's firepower prompted some MPs to predict that - despite the foot and mouth crisis - Tony Blair will not wait for a May 3 election, but call one almost immediately for April 5. The chancellor announced an extra \u00a31bn for headteachers - up to \u00a315,000 for every school - and another \u00a31bn for hospitals, between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a31m per trust, in the fight to restore long-neglected services. An additional \u00a3300m will be allocated over three years to help communities fight drug-related crime. Mr Brown described his Budget as a response to a century in which the needs of children had been ignored. He announced \u00a3500m for an expansion of paid maternity and paternity leave and \u00a31.2bn targeted at children in the poorest families - including a \u00a31,000 \"baby credit\" from 2002. Officials were less keen to emphasise the \u00a31.9bn worth of cuts in petrol and vehicle taxes on smaller cars and lorries which Mr Brown confirmed after \"consulation\" since last November when militant hauliers were threatening renewed blockades if ministers did not heed their plight.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This was not a Budget to win an election, but a Budget for an election that is already won. Its handouts were slight, its promises distant, its perspectives closer to five years than five weeks. It was like a matching reward for the two years of parsimony with which Gordon Brown began his tenure. Having started in 1997 by creating a first-term platform to prove how conservative he could be, yesterday he built one for the second term in which he and Tony Blair must show how socialistic, at heart, they really are. They have shown long-term rigour, almost to a fault.</p> <p>Given the size of the surplus, Mr Brown could have given far more away. Most of his predecessors would have done. He doesn't need to be paying down the national debt at this record-breaking rate. Given the imminence of May 3, or even June 7, he could have made blatant offerings to a much wider group of voters than families with children. But given that this is a Blair-Brown government, the most intimate and potent duumvirate of modern times, there was always a decent chance that it would exploit its political strength in order to take economically cautious decisions.</p> <p>Though they've kept a close eye on the voters, this is what they have done. Before the Budget, uprating of pensions and then the minimum wage reminded many millions that the government was listening. The ministers have looked after the masses. New micro-measures are targeted to keep motorists and hauliers and drinkers happy. But the larger politics of the Budget are almost counter-intuitive. They marry the long road of economic reform to the long life of those who now plan undeviatingly to traverse it.</p> <p>Over Mr Brown's five Budgets, the occasion has been transformed. The Budget is supposed to be an economic climax, and that's the way it is still treated. We all play the game. There are special supplements and ceremonially spacious television programmes. The details are breathlessly awaited. The rituals of pomp and circumstance have barely changed since the first Budget I can remember, which was Reginald Maudling's in the early 1960s.</p> <p>While happy to go along with such ornamentalism, Mr Brown has changed the substance into something else. His Budgets have grown into a cunning mixture of measures already leaked and other measures, especially taxes, that the Budget statement itself may omit to specify at all. Once the sacred unveiling of an economic secret, it has become an amalgam of the repetitious and, sometimes, the unrevealed. Once the occasion for a grand overview of the great forces that touched the famous Budget Judgment, it is now an interim statement of work in progress by the chief executive of UK plc.</p> <p>That's how Gordon Brown sounded yesterday, rattling through a long series of undifferentiated passages, no rise and fall, no break between, no rhetorical shape, some of them detailed, others vague, others alluding to future statements and documents to come. He seemed impatient more than triumphalist, though he had a happy story to tell. The great man was being briefly interrupted in his life's work of digging ever deeper into the entrails of the economy and society. He has been doing it, after all, for more than a decade - 24/7, as they say, every hour, every day, every week - since he was John Smith's deputy in the Kinnock shadow cabinet.</p> <p>So there was something peremptory in his lack of need to explain his final Budget of the first term. Far from awaiting this definitive statement, Budget-watchers are now meant to have kept up with the copious preliminaries. Anyone who missed those earlier speeches and half-revelations, the unrepeatable sub-texts of the Budget statement itself, doesn't deserve to understand the sheer critical mass of strategy that lies behind it, the long-termism, the profundity of Brown-Blairite social reforms.</p> <p>In this, Mr Brown is unlike any predecessor not only because of his own seriousness but because of the system he invented in the first week of his tenure. Handing monetary policy over to the monetary policy committee of the Bank was not only good for the stability of the economy. Almost as telling, it released the chancellor from the most neuralgic part of his job, fixing interest rates, thus giving a strategist such as Mr Brown time and space to undertake the deeper tasks for which he went into politics. Even in times as untroubled as the present, the aura of the monetary judgment in the old days would distract from the rest of the Budget.</p> <p>Freed from that, Mr Brown continues on his path. The philosophy of work as the cure for all deprivation is replenished with every Budget. No worries there about recent evidence that Brits work their backs off for longer hours than anyone in Europe. Whether beset by drugs or burdened with children, people have to pass the fit-for-work test, for which the state will provide sticks as well as carrots.</p> <p>That's the first common thread. The second, now, is the commitment to public services. The new billions announced yesterday were not as big as they could well afford to have been. It sounds as though the Treasury has been listening more than it would ever admit to the hyper-caution of the International Monetary Fund, which recently, to Mr Brown's rage, dared to cast a shadow of a doubt on his prudence.</p> <p>But in the second term, for which this Budget is designed, will come the major political test for Blairism. There is another, of which the chancellor is acutely aware, the lamentable record of the British economy, despite the fine general out-turn of the last five years, in productivity.</p> <p>A failure to make a serious impact on productivity over the next half-decade will leave the UK economy struggling against euroland. But the prime targets have to be education and health and crime, and also, I would say, defence, the quality of which will deserve to settle the fate of the Labour government by the end of the next parliament.</p> <p>Mr Blair and Mr Brown understand that. They have a complicated relationship. No prime minister and chancellor have been more equal. None have been at the same time such rivals and such friends. But they have got where they are together, and taken the country on a track they did not argue about. They had a common vision of how the first term should start and how it should end. Their history together may produce an explosive chemistry, especially when their respective acolytes get together and start making trouble.</p> <p>But the principals themselves have far more to be said for them than against them. The record Mr Brown was able to celebrate yesterday, however unexuberantly, did not have to happen. They made it happen.</p> <p>Political life was rather different the last time Labour was in power.</p> <p>Nearly four years in from the start of the 1974 government, Tony Benn recorded the state of things at the pre-Budget cabinet meeting, when Denis Healey had Mr Brown's job.</p> <p>\"Denis went on about industrial performance, design and marketing, just mouthing the phrases; in the end what we're saying is it's the working class that are responsible for all the troubles. I actually came away more depressed than I have ever been.</p> <p>\"Full employment is no longer on the agenda of a Labour government. They haven't even got a strategy for the 80s. They simply haven't got a strategy.\"</p> <p>Things have improved just a little.</p> <p><b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>Comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "This was not a Budget to win an election, but a Budget for an election that is already won. Its handouts were slight, its promises distant, its perspectives closer to five years than five weeks. It was like a matching reward for the two years of parsimony with which Gordon Brown began his tenure. Having started in 1997 by creating a first-term platform to prove how conservative he could be, yesterday he built one for the second term in which he and Tony Blair must show how socialistic, at heart, they really are. They have shown long-term rigour, almost to a fault. Given the size of the surplus, Mr Brown could have given far more away. Most of his predecessors would have done. He doesn't need to be paying down the national debt at this record-breaking rate. Given the imminence of May 3, or even June 7, he could have made blatant offerings to a much wider group of voters than families with children. But given that this is a Blair-Brown government, the most intimate and potent duumvirate of modern times, there was always a decent chance that it would exploit its political strength in order to take economically cautious decisions. Though they've kept a close eye on the voters, this is what they have done. Before the Budget, uprating of pensions and then the minimum wage reminded many millions that the government was listening. The ministers have looked after the masses. New micro-measures are targeted to keep motorists and hauliers and drinkers happy. But the larger politics of the Budget are almost counter-intuitive. They marry the long road of economic reform to the long life of those who now plan undeviatingly to traverse it. Over Mr Brown's five Budgets, the occasion has been transformed. The Budget is supposed to be an economic climax, and that's the way it is still treated. We all play the game. There are special supplements and ceremonially spacious television programmes. The details are breathlessly awaited. The rituals of pomp and circumstance have barely changed since the first Budget I can remember, which was Reginald Maudling's in the early 1960s. While happy to go along with such ornamentalism, Mr Brown has changed the substance into something else. His Budgets have grown into a cunning mixture of measures already leaked and other measures, especially taxes, that the Budget statement itself may omit to specify at all. Once the sacred unveiling of an economic secret, it has become an amalgam of the repetitious and, sometimes, the unrevealed. Once the occasion for a grand overview of the great forces that touched the famous Budget Judgment, it is now an interim statement of work in progress by the chief executive of UK plc. That's how Gordon Brown sounded yesterday, rattling through a long series of undifferentiated passages, no rise and fall, no break between, no rhetorical shape, some of them detailed, others vague, others alluding to future statements and documents to come. He seemed impatient more than triumphalist, though he had a happy story to tell. The great man was being briefly interrupted in his life's work of digging ever deeper into the entrails of the economy and society. He has been doing it, after all, for more than a decade - 24/7, as they say, every hour, every day, every week - since he was John Smith's deputy in the Kinnock shadow cabinet. So there was something peremptory in his lack of need to explain his final Budget of the first term. Far from awaiting this definitive statement, Budget-watchers are now meant to have kept up with the copious preliminaries. Anyone who missed those earlier speeches and half-revelations, the unrepeatable sub-texts of the Budget statement itself, doesn't deserve to understand the sheer critical mass of strategy that lies behind it, the long-termism, the profundity of Brown-Blairite social reforms. In this, Mr Brown is unlike any predecessor not only because of his own seriousness but because of the system he invented in the first week of his tenure. Handing monetary policy over to the monetary policy committee of the Bank was not only good for the stability of the economy. Almost as telling, it released the chancellor from the most neuralgic part of his job, fixing interest rates, thus giving a strategist such as Mr Brown time and space to undertake the deeper tasks for which he went into politics. Even in times as untroubled as the present, the aura of the monetary judgment in the old days would distract from the rest of the Budget. Freed from that, Mr Brown continues on his path. The philosophy of work as the cure for all deprivation is replenished with every Budget. No worries there about recent evidence that Brits work their backs off for longer hours than anyone in Europe. Whether beset by drugs or burdened with children, people have to pass the fit-for-work test, for which the state will provide sticks as well as carrots. That's the first common thread. The second, now, is the commitment to public services. The new billions announced yesterday were not as big as they could well afford to have been. It sounds as though the Treasury has been listening more than it would ever admit to the hyper-caution of the International Monetary Fund, which recently, to Mr Brown's rage, dared to cast a shadow of a doubt on his prudence. But in the second term, for which this Budget is designed, will come the major political test for Blairism. There is another, of which the chancellor is acutely aware, the lamentable record of the British economy, despite the fine general out-turn of the last five years, in productivity. A failure to make a serious impact on productivity over the next half-decade will leave the UK economy struggling against euroland. But the prime targets have to be education and health and crime, and also, I would say, defence, the quality of which will deserve to settle the fate of the Labour government by the end of the next parliament. Mr Blair and Mr Brown understand that. They have a complicated relationship. No prime minister and chancellor have been more equal. None have been at the same time such rivals and such friends. But they have got where they are together, and taken the country on a track they did not argue about. They had a common vision of how the first term should start and how it should end. Their history together may produce an explosive chemistry, especially when their respective acolytes get together and start making trouble. But the principals themselves have far more to be said for them than against them. The record Mr Brown was able to celebrate yesterday, however unexuberantly, did not have to happen. They made it happen. Political life was rather different the last time Labour was in power. Nearly four years in from the start of the 1974 government, Tony Benn recorded the state of things at the pre-Budget cabinet meeting, when Denis Healey had Mr Brown's job. \"Denis went on about industrial performance, design and marketing, just mouthing the phrases; in the end what we're saying is it's the working class that are responsible for all the troubles. I actually came away more depressed than I have ever been. \"Full employment is no longer on the agenda of a Labour government. They haven't even got a strategy for the 80s. They simply haven't got a strategy.\" Things have improved just a little.

In November the corresponding figures were \u00a316bn, \u00a314bn, \u00a38bn, \u00a38bn and \u00a38bn. In each year, Mr Brown will meet his golden rule, that all current expenditure should be financed out of tax receipts. </p> <p>The chancellor permits himself to borrow to finance capital expenditure, believing that, since projects such as new schools and hospitals benefit future as well as current generations, they should be required to pay part of the bill via debt interest payments. </p> <p>Even so, public sector net borrowing, excluding windfall tax receipts, will be lower than predicted in November. In the current financial year there will be a net debt repayment of \u00a316.4bn, up from \u00a310.1 forecast in the PBR. In 2001-02, the repayment will be \u00a36bn, unchanged from November's estimate. </p> <p>Thereafter, the figures go into the red, with the government borrowing \u00a31bn in 2002-03, the same as predicted in November, followed by borrowing requirements of \u00a310bn in 2003-04 (\u00a310bn), \u00a311bn in 2004-05 (\u00a312bn) and \u00a312bn in 2005-06 (\u00a313bn). </p> <p>Despite these deficits, Mr Brown easily meets his other rule for the public finances, the so-called sustainable investment rule, which stipulates that the debt to GDP ratio should be kept stable below 40%. </p> <p>In the current year, net debt is expected to be 31.8% of GDP, falling to 30.3% in the coming year, 29.6% in 2002-03 before beginning to edge up again to 29.7% in 2003-04, 29.9% in 2004-05 and 30% in 2005-06. </p> <p>While rising towards the end of the forecast period, the debt to GDP ratio is still forecast to be lower in every year than forecast in the PBR, when the corresponding figures were 32.3% this year, 30.9% next, 30.1% in 2002-03, 30.2% in 2003-04, 30.3% in 2004-05 and 30.4% in 2005-06. </p> <p>Mr Brown boasted: \"In total because of the government's prudence, debt interest payments in the coming year will be \u00a33.5bn lower than this year, releasing resources for our priorities. </p> <p>\"In 1997 Britain spent more on debt interest payments than all the money it spent on our schools. In 2001-02 we will be spending \u00a310bn a year more on schools than on debt interest.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown added that since 1997 lower unemployment has also reduced social security costs by \u00a34bn a year, releasing resources for public services. </p> <p>\"Whereas from 1979 to 1997 42p in every extra pound spent went to debt and social security, now the figure is only 16p, leaving more than 80p in every extra pound to go direct to frontline public services.\" </p> <p><strong>The Budget in detail</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><strong>Interactive</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><strong>Comment</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><strong>Audio</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><strong>Game</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><strong>Photo gallery</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><strong>Quiz</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><strong>What does it mean for me?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><strong>Public sector Budget analysis</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><strong>Chancellors</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><strong>Special reports</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\">HM Treasury Budget page</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

Norman Lamont stood up to deliver his Budget speech with the economy deep in recession, businesses going bankrupt in droves and unemployment heading rapidly towards 3m. Yet, Lamont had one trump to play. He announced a tax cut in the form of a new 20% band of income tax, thereby setting the terms of the economic debate in the election campaign that was launched by John Major the very next day.</p> <p>This was the way things were during the long Conservative hegemony. As an election loomed, the chancellor would cut taxes and tie his Labour opponent up in knots by challenging him to match the reductions pound for pound.</p> <p>The real political significance of Gordon Brown's address yesterday was that it turned the orthodoxy of the past 20 years on its head. One thing is certain: whenever the election is held, it will not turn into a Dutch auction on tax. Instead, it will be up to the Conservatives either to match Labour's 3.7% increases in public spending in each of the next three years or to say where they expect to make savings. All the signs suggest that William Hague and Michael Portillo will have just as much trouble convincing the voters that their plans add up as did Neil Kinnock and John Smith did in 1992.</p> <p>Naturally, the picture is a bit more complex than this. Despite the extra money for schools and hospitals, the biggest single winner from yesterday's package was the road lobby, a rather inconvenient fact in the light of the prime minister's \"greening of Britain\" pledge on Tuesday. Nor is Brown's political victory complete. He may have rehabilitated the idea of higher public spending, but he has not even attempted to do the same for tax.</p> <p>But the environmental damage caused by caving in to the road lobby will not be evident for some time, and higher tax is not an issue that political parties care to talk about when polling day is probably less than two months away. The real point of the Budget was to set the terms of combat for the election and that Brown has done. Unlike previous Labour chancellors, he has not presided over economic disaster or humiliation; indeed, the first chunk of his speech was given over to a familiar litany of achievement - lowest inflation, interest rates and unemployment in decades. There have been no devaluations, no visits from the International Monetary Fund, no crisis measures. The squeeze on spending came early, not late.</p> <p>The benign state of the economy is not all the chancellor's doing. He was at pains yesterday to paint a black picture of the country on the day Labour came to power, but the reality was that he had the finest inheritance of any Labour chancellor. The economy was already doing well when the Conservatives left office, and through a mixture of luck and skill Brown has ensured that it has stayed that way. Had Kenneth Clarke still been at the Treasury, he too would have had barrowloads of money with which to cut taxes or increase spending.</p> <p>But by securing a reputation for economic competence, Brown has been able to shift economic priorities in two distinct ways. The increases in spending on health and education over the next three years were large enough even without the top-ups announced yesterday, although they needed to be after the austerity of the first two years. The fact that some of the money is to be used for recruitment and retention drives in the NHS and in education is evidence of the problems caused by sticking to the spending plans laid down by Clarke ahead of the 1997 election. There is a lot more to do in a second term.</p> <p>Second, Brown has been able to make the tax and benefit system more progressive, a stark difference from the consistently regressive trend between 1979 and 1997. A lot of the rhetoric of New Labour has been about its new-found admiration for risk-taking entrepreneurs, but the beneficiaries of fiscal policy have been those at the bottom of the income scale. The national minimum wage, the working families tax credit, reductions in income tax and national insurance contributions and the increases to child benefit and income-related benefit have helped the poor far more than the rich.</p> <p>According to the Treasury's budget red book, every group of working age households has gained as a result of Labour's five Budgets since 1997. But whereas the richest 10% are better off by around \u00a32 a week, the poorest 10% of working age households are almost \u00a320 a week better off. The second poorest 10% of households are doing even better, because more of them are in work, and Brown's tax credits have been aimed at the working poor.</p> <p>Will middle England swallow all this? They will provided interest rates stay low, and Brown's decision to spare drinkers and smokers higher excise duties will drive down inflation and keep pressure on the Bank to cut interest rates even though demand is being expanded. Cute that. Very cute.</p> <p><b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>Comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Cast your mind back nine long years. Norman Lamont stood up to deliver his Budget speech with the economy deep in recession, businesses going bankrupt in droves and unemployment heading rapidly towards 3m. Yet, Lamont had one trump to play. He announced a tax cut in the form of a new 20% band of income tax, thereby setting the terms of the economic debate in the election campaign that was launched by John Major the very next day. This was the way things were during the long Conservative hegemony. As an election loomed, the chancellor would cut taxes and tie his Labour opponent up in knots by challenging him to match the reductions pound for pound. The real political significance of Gordon Brown's address yesterday was that it turned the orthodoxy of the past 20 years on its head. One thing is certain: whenever the election is held, it will not turn into a Dutch auction on tax. Instead, it will be up to the Conservatives either to match Labour's 3.7% increases in public spending in each of the next three years or to say where they expect to make savings. All the signs suggest that William Hague and Michael Portillo will have just as much trouble convincing the voters that their plans add up as did Neil Kinnock and John Smith did in 1992. Naturally, the picture is a bit more complex than this. Despite the extra money for schools and hospitals, the biggest single winner from yesterday's package was the road lobby, a rather inconvenient fact in the light of the prime minister's \"greening of Britain\" pledge on Tuesday. Nor is Brown's political victory complete. He may have rehabilitated the idea of higher public spending, but he has not even attempted to do the same for tax. But the environmental damage caused by caving in to the road lobby will not be evident for some time, and higher tax is not an issue that political parties care to talk about when polling day is probably less than two months away. The real point of the Budget was to set the terms of combat for the election and that Brown has done. Unlike previous Labour chancellors, he has not presided over economic disaster or humiliation; indeed, the first chunk of his speech was given over to a familiar litany of achievement - lowest inflation, interest rates and unemployment in decades. There have been no devaluations, no visits from the International Monetary Fund, no crisis measures. The squeeze on spending came early, not late. The benign state of the economy is not all the chancellor's doing.

      "body": "<p>William Hague yesterday attacked Gordon Brown for delivering a \"cynical election budget\" which would fail to compensate millions of taxpayers for the hike in \"stealth taxes\" since Labour came to power in 1997.</p> <p>The Tory leader said that voters would not be fooled by the chancellor who introduced the equivalent of a 1p tax cut yesterday after penalising people with the equivalent of a 10p tax rise in the past four years.</p> <p>\"He has produced a cynical election budget: the 10p up 1p down budget that gives with one hand when far more has already been taken back by the other,\" Mr Hague said. \"He is like the thief who steals someone's car and comes back the next day to return the hub caps.\"</p> <p>Seizing on yesterday's report by the rightwing Centre for Policy Studies, which claimed that Labour has imposed \u00a336bn in stealth taxes, Mr Hague said that taxpayers have suffered across the board. \"Taxes have gone up on marriages, mortgages, pensions, petrol, diesel, cars, homes, medical insurance, savings, small businesses, large businesses and the self-employed,\" he said. \"And so to suddenly turn up today with tax reductions is a cynical election budget.\"</p> <p>Voters would be suspicious of the budget, Mr Hague added, because many of the chancellor's claims over the past four years have subsequently turned out to be false.</p> <p>Criticising Mr Brown for claiming that the tax burden on the average family has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years, Mr Hague said: \"In saying that, he only included direct taxes and left out all of his stealth taxes on petrol, pensions, cars, alcohol, cigarettes and council tax.</p> <p>\"His statement would only be true for people who never drink, do not have a pension, do not even have a local council.\"</p> <p>The chancellor had mistakenly assumed that voters were stupid because the average family was worse off by \u00a3670 a year under Labour, Mr Hague said.</p> <p>He accused Mr Brown of hitting the poorest 20% of house holds with a tax burden that had risen under Labour from 36 to 40% of their gross income.</p> <p>\"He goes around posing as the friend of the least well off but what does he do? He hits them even harder. This is a budget whose tax reductions are entirely motivated by the onset of a general election.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, accused Mr Brown of offering a politically motivated budget, which emphasised tax cuts while neglecting public spending.</p> <p>The chancellor had devoted five times as much financial priority to tax reductions as investing in health and education, he said, suggesting claims of \u00a32bn spending on schools and hospitals in fact amounted to only \u00a30.5bn because \"all of next year's spending is simply money he failed to spend this year\".</p> <p>The budget had to be seen in the context of rising class sizes, longer hospital waiting lists, fewer police, more violent crime, immobilised public transport and a record number of winter deaths among pensioners, Mr Kennedy told MPs.</p> <p>In replacing Tory deficits with a Labour war chest Mr Brown's \"prudent approach\" had squeezed public spending so savagely that the proportion of national income spent on schools, hospitals and pensioners was now less than under the previous government.</p> <p>Mr Kennedy also lamented the absence of measures aimed at helping farmers struggling amid the foot and mouth crisis. He said Mr Brown had missed an opportunity to follow the lead of the Scottish parliament over scrapping tuition fees and providing free personal care for the elderly.</p> <p>The leftwing Labour MP Diane Abbott (Hackney North and Stoke Newington) hailed the measures as a \"masterly budget, presented in a masterly fashion by a masterly chancellor\".</p> <p>But she said there was underlying \"this most modern of chancellors, a very old fashioned notion that there are the deserving poor - people who are prepared to leave their children however young and go out to work - and the undeserving poor - women who choose to stay with their children at least until school age\".</p> <p>She warned: \"A Victorian distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor embedded in this system of tax credits does not reflect well on a 21st century Labour government.\"</p> <p>Ms Abbott said that while many did benefit from initiatives like the working families tax credit, \"sadly there are millions of poor people, particularly single mothers with very young children\" who were not reached by such a system of tax credits.</p> <p><b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a

Criticising Mr Brown for claiming that the tax burden on the average family has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years, Mr Hague said: \"In saying that, he only included direct taxes and left out all of his stealth taxes on petrol, pensions, cars, alcohol, cigarettes and council tax. \"His statement would only be true for people who never drink, do not have a pension, do not even have a local council.\" The chancellor had mistakenly assumed that voters were stupid because the average family was worse off by \u00a3670 a year under Labour, Mr Hague said. He accused Mr Brown of hitting the poorest 20% of house holds with a tax burden that had risen under Labour from 36 to 40% of their gross income. \"He goes around posing as the friend of the least well off but what does he do? He hits them even harder. This is a budget whose tax reductions are entirely motivated by the onset of a general election.\" The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, accused Mr Brown of offering a politically motivated budget, which emphasised tax cuts while neglecting public spending. The chancellor had devoted five times as much financial priority to tax reductions as investing in health and education, he said, suggesting claims of \u00a32bn spending on schools and hospitals in fact amounted to only \u00a30.5bn because \"all of next year's spending is simply money he failed to spend this year\". The budget had to be seen in the context of rising class sizes, longer hospital waiting lists, fewer police, more violent crime, immobilised public transport and a record number of winter deaths among pensioners, Mr Kennedy told MPs. In replacing Tory deficits with a Labour war chest Mr Brown's \"prudent approach\" had squeezed public spending so savagely that the proportion of national income spent on schools, hospitals and pensioners was now less than under the previous government. Mr Kennedy also lamented the absence of measures aimed at helping farmers struggling amid the foot and mouth crisis. He said Mr Brown had missed an opportunity to follow the lead of the Scottish parliament over scrapping tuition fees and providing free personal care for the elderly. The leftwing Labour MP Diane Abbott (Hackney North and Stoke Newington) hailed the measures as a \"masterly budget, presented in a masterly fashion by a masterly chancellor\". But she said there was underlying \"this most modern of chancellors, a very old fashioned notion that there are the deserving poor - people who are prepared to leave their children however young and go out to work - and the undeserving poor - women who choose to stay with their children at least until school age\". She warned: \"A Victorian distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor embedded in this system of tax credits does not reflect well on a 21st century Labour government.\" Ms Abbott said that while many did benefit from initiatives like the working families tax credit, \"sadly there are millions of poor people, particularly single mothers with very young children\" who were not reached by such a system of tax credits.

Archaeologists tried in vain to unlock the secrets of life in first century Britain.</p> <p>But by using a high resolution camera a team of Oxford University scientists and historians has gained a glimpse into everyday Roman activities, from shopping to a contract freeing a slave.</p> <p>The tablets, on display at the Science Museum in London, date from AD85-125 and were excavated at a site at Hadrian's Wall in the 1970s. Each is made of a curved segment of hollowed out Scots pine, covered with a layer of wax on which notes were written with a metal stylus; in many cases the tablets were used over and over again by smoothing the wax to write a fresh note.</p> <p>Some tablets list the food and clothes required by Roman garrisons. They reveal that life was far from easy for the average soldier protecting the northern frontier from marauding Picts.</p> <p>He would have had to fork out 8% of his 25 denarii annual income to buy his uniform. If he wanted a cloak to protect him from the hostile climate, he would have had to hand over another 10% of his salary. Other essential items included radishes, quantities of human hair, necklace clasps and vehicle axles.</p> <p>Another tablet describes a recruitment drive to persuade members of the Anavionenses tribe, who lived around the Annan river in south-west Scotland, to join the army. Another is a contract releasing a slave to work elsewhere in the empire as a free man.</p> <p>Alan Bowman, a Roman history lecturer and expert in deciphering ancient documents, said yesterday: \"It is a terrific thrill to read something which hasn't been read for almost 2,000 years. You are always going to find something new or unusual.\"</p> <p>The breakthrough came almost by accident when Dr Bowman asked a friend, Mike Brady, an image analyst in Oxford's engineering department, to look at the tablets. The original wax had disappeared long ago, so that the only remaining marks were scratches on the wood where the stylus had pushed through, and some tablets had been used many times over.</p> <p>At first Prof Brady was stumped. But he spotted another researcher reading a tablet by rolling it about in his hand to play the light on to it, creating shadows which highlighted the indentations of the writing.</p> <p>With funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the team used a high resolution camera, powerful directional light, and a specially developed mathematical formula to highlight the incisions and translate them into letters.</p> <p>\"If Alan hadn't pointed out that there was writing on them I wouldn't have had a clue,\" Prof Brady said. \"As a layman I would have thrown them in the bin, but we cracked it and the best thing about it is that the basic idea behind the science was so simple.\"</p> <p>The team believe that their approach will have a huge impact for historians trying to decipher ancient documents. But the potential benefits do not end there. Prof Brady, whose normal speciality is breast cancer, has discovered that the same principle and an adapted formula may offer an early detection system. Used on mammograms, the technique gives detailed images of the milk ducts, showing up any minor calcifications which can point to abnormalities.</p> <p>Prof Brady said: \"The best thing about this project has been the unexpected windfall for me. The crossover from the classics to medicine is incredible. It is serendipity.\"</p>",

The tablets, on display at the Science Museum in London, date from AD85-125 and were excavated at a site at Hadrian's Wall in the 1970s. Each is made of a curved segment of hollowed out Scots pine, covered with a layer of wax on which notes were written with a metal stylus; in many cases the tablets were used over and over again by smoothing the wax to write a fresh note. Some tablets list the food and clothes required by Roman garrisons. They reveal that life was far from easy for the average soldier protecting the northern frontier from marauding Picts. He would have had to fork out 8% of his 25 denarii annual income to buy his uniform. If he wanted a cloak to protect him from the hostile climate, he would have had to hand over another 10% of his salary. Other essential items included radishes, quantities of human hair, necklace clasps and vehicle axles. Another tablet describes a recruitment drive to persuade members of the Anavionenses tribe, who lived around the Annan river in south-west Scotland, to join the army. Another is a contract releasing a slave to work elsewhere in the empire as a free man. Alan Bowman, a Roman history lecturer and expert in deciphering ancient documents, said yesterday: \"It is a terrific thrill to read something which hasn't been read for almost 2,000 years. You are always going to find something new or unusual.\" The breakthrough came almost by accident when Dr Bowman asked a friend, Mike Brady, an image analyst in Oxford's engineering department, to look at the tablets. The original wax had disappeared long ago, so that the only remaining marks were scratches on the wood where the stylus had pushed through, and some tablets had been used many times over. At first Prof Brady was stumped. But he spotted another researcher reading a tablet by rolling it about in his hand to play the light on to it, creating shadows which highlighted the indentations of the writing. With funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the team used a high resolution camera, powerful directional light, and a specially developed mathematical formula to highlight the incisions and translate them into letters. \"If Alan hadn't pointed out that there was writing on them I wouldn't have had a clue,\" Prof Brady said. \"As a layman I would have thrown them in the bin, but we cracked it and the best thing about it is that the basic idea behind the science was so simple.\" The team believe that their approach will have a huge impact for historians trying to decipher ancient documents. But the potential benefits do not end there. Prof Brady, whose normal speciality is breast cancer, has discovered that the same principle and an adapted formula may offer an early detection system. Used on mammograms, the technique gives detailed images of the milk ducts, showing up any minor calcifications which can point to abnormalities. Prof Brady said: \"The best thing about this project has been the unexpected windfall for me. The crossover from the classics to medicine is incredible. It is serendipity.\"",

      "body": "<p>William Atkinson is the head teacher of Phoenix high school in White City, west London, an inner city comprehensive that was officially \"failing\" when he took over in 1995.</p> <p>With his school one of hundreds in the south east struggling to cope with the impact of teacher shortages, he welcomed the Budget's education measures as likely to help him recruit more staff, and support both pupils and teachers with additional resources.</p> <p>\"This is my third headship, and I have seen many education changes under different governments,\" he said. \"But the significant difference under Labour has been the substantial extra money being brought directly into schools. I am pleased that in the latest Budget the government is continuing this policy\".</p> <p>Mr Atkinson - pictured above - who is said to have been the inspiration for the recent BBC TV series Hope and Glory, starring Lenny Henry as the head of a struggling school, saw the measures - notably further direct grants for heads and bonuses to attract \"returners\" to the teaching profession - as much needed help to take the pressure off school budgets and also help to recruit and retain teachers.</p> <p>\"The overall package sounds very good and very even handed because it will benefit all schools,\" he said. \"This will help us enormously. Even if it is a pre-election ploy, it is a three year spending commitment which makes it easier to plan ahead.\"</p> <p>Teachers were key to delivering the government's standards agenda, he said, which meant that heads had particular difficulties when there were serious shortages. \"I've been very worried about teacher morale and recruitment,\" he said.</p> <p>\"At the moment I am fifteen teachers short, which means that one third of my staff are supply teachers\".</p> <p>At Phoenix, which has 800 pupils aged 11-16 on its roll, problems came to a head just before Christmas, when anything between four and nine classes had to be taught together in the dining hall.</p> <p>\"I absolutely did not want to send students home, as in many cases it was quite a struggle to get them to school in the first place,\" he said. \"And I did not want to pass those problems on to parents.\"</p> <p>The prospect of a further tranche of cash going direct to schools without the need for complex and lengthy bidding was a major boost, Mr Atkinson agreed. Schools are allocated the money based on pupil numbers, so as a result of last year's Budget, for example, he got \u00a347,000; while the autumn statement led to a promise of a further \u00a360,000 next month. \"Among my concerns is the fact that, too often, to get extra resources, we are forced into a time-consuming bidding process, which leads many schools to employ consultants in an effort to maximise their chances of being successful,\" he added. \"That really can't be right. It is so much easier when we get the money direct.</p> <p>The extra cash earmarked by the government for capital projects was essential, he concluded.</p> <p>\"Extra money for school repairs has made a real difference as you can't teach students properly when they are subjected to leaky roofs and broken windows\".</p> <p><b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>Comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

With his school one of hundreds in the south east struggling to cope with the impact of teacher shortages, he welcomed the Budget's education measures as likely to help him recruit more staff, and support both pupils and teachers with additional resources. \"This is my third headship, and I have seen many education changes under different governments,\" he said. \"But the significant difference under Labour has been the substantial extra money being brought directly into schools. I am pleased that in the latest Budget the government is continuing this policy\". Mr Atkinson - pictured above - who is said to have been the inspiration for the recent BBC TV series Hope and Glory, starring Lenny Henry as the head of a struggling school, saw the measures - notably further direct grants for heads and bonuses to attract \"returners\" to the teaching profession - as much needed help to take the pressure off school budgets and also help to recruit and retain teachers. \"The overall package sounds very good and very even handed because it will benefit all schools,\" he said. \"This will help us enormously. Even if it is a pre-election ploy, it is a three year spending commitment which makes it easier to plan ahead.\" Teachers were key to delivering the government's standards agenda, he said, which meant that heads had particular difficulties when there were serious shortages. \"I've been very worried about teacher morale and recruitment,\" he said. \"At the moment I am fifteen teachers short, which means that one third of my staff are supply teachers\". At Phoenix, which has 800 pupils aged 11-16 on its roll, problems came to a head just before Christmas, when anything between four and nine classes had to be taught together in the dining hall. \"I absolutely did not want to send students home, as in many cases it was quite a struggle to get them to school in the first place,\" he said. \"And I did not want to pass those problems on to parents.\" The prospect of a further tranche of cash going direct to schools without the need for complex and lengthy bidding was a major boost, Mr Atkinson agreed. Schools are allocated the money based on pupil numbers, so as a result of last year's Budget, for example, he got \u00a347,000; while the autumn statement led to a promise of a further \u00a360,000 next month. \"Among my concerns is the fact that, too often, to get extra resources, we are forced into a time-consuming bidding process, which leads many schools to employ consultants in an effort to maximise their chances of being successful,\" he added. \"That really can't be right. It is so much easier when we get the money direct. The extra cash earmarked by the government for capital projects was essential, he concluded. \"Extra money for school repairs has made a real difference as you can't teach students properly when they are subjected to leaky roofs and broken windows\".

The Waterhouse report, which detailed the tragic consequences of abuse in care homes in north Wales, and a number of critical joint reviews into local authority social services departments, are seen by many working in social care in Wales as contributing to the problem. \"Waterhouse certainly has not helped in the sense that it has created a feeling that there is a special problem surrounding the integrity of people working in residential child care in Wales.

We have seen staff move from authorities that have experienced damaging reporting.\" Now, as a result of serious concern over the recruitment and retention of staff in the sector, the National Assembly of Wales has commissioned a working party - the \"task and finish group\" - to investigate the issues over the next two months. Chaired by Graham Williams, chief inspector of the social services inspectorate Wales and including key players in social care in Wales, the 14-strong group will consult with employers, the assembly itself, and major organisations in Wales. Once it has reported back, an additional \u00a3500,000 that the assembly has earmarked for recruitment and retention will be made available. Latest data from the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work (CCETSW Cymru) shows that around half the 22 local authorities in Wales are now reporting a shortage of social workers, especially in child and family services. Research by the organisation also shows that newly qualified staff are likely to stay in child care work for an average of only three years. The national assembly has also warned that the numbers of people applying for social work training have been falling, despite an increase in service demand. It predicts that 2,000 new staff will be needed every year between now and 2006. But, despite the problems within the SSS, the voluntary sector in Wales is experiencing less difficulty in recruiting social workers, according to CCETSW Cymru. \"Local authorities undertake most of the child protection and statutory work and the voluntary sector can offer more development workwe think this is why they are able to recruit more easily,\" said Rhian Huws Williams, head of CCETSW Cymru and a member of the task and finish group. Together with the headline cases that have attracted adverse publicity, practitioners working in social care also see other factors influencing recruitment and retention. \"The brief that we are looking at covers a large spectrum of workers, from the low paid in social care, who are usually without formal qualifications, to the professionally qualified social worker,\" said Dominic Macaskill of public sector union Unison, which will also be contributing to the debate over the next few weeks. \"For both groups of staff there are implications because of the serious social deprivation in Wales which results in a number of social consequences.

He lists the key improvements that have been put into practice. \"One of the main ones is that a child should not be returned to a schedule 1 offender [convicted of violent offences against a child] without a thorough discussion with a senior child protection officer or without a multi-agency child protection conference. We've implemented that. \"We want to ensure that there is regular refresher training for frontline managers. We're doing that. \"We're making sure that social workers have easier access to managers and more encouragement for better communication between staff and managers.\" Ms Owen points out that: \"Social workers work with a huge amount of risk.\" Just days before her death, Derbyshire social workers had indeed been weighing up the risks involved in leaving the toddler with her parents and were considering removing her. While the report found that Brown's murderous actions could not have been predicted, had social services, health or probation professionals made that crucial decision to follow procedures, bring in police and call a case conference, after the doctor pointed out the likelihood she was being beaten, it is almost certain that Chelsea would still be alive. Report recommendations to social services: \u0095 Staff must be reminded that non-accidental injuries must lead to strategy meeting or discussion with police and child protection manager; \u0095 Supervision of service managers should include looking at child protection cases; \u0095 Managers supervising child protection social workers must be trained in analysing and evaluating their work; \u0095 Child protection managers should record all case discussions, decisions and reasons; \u0095 Recording of injuries must be reviewed; \u0095 Children under supervision orders should be reviewed as often as care order cases; \u0095 The amount of assessment required when applying for residence orders must be formally considered; \u0095 A senior area childcare manager must agree before a child is returned to the home of a schedule 1 offender - and they should consider a multi-agency case conference. Report recommendations to the area child protection committee (ACPC): \u0095 Children on the child protection register with injuries should have an expert medical assessment; \u0095 All agencies must be proactive (and managers and supervisors may need child protection training to achieve this); \u0095 Full case conference minutes should be sent to all workers involved in child protection plans; \u0095 Area child protection committee training must be reviewed - particularly management of injuries training. Report recommendations to health service: \u0095 GPs must have systems for sharing information regularly with health visitors about at-risk children; \u0095 Health visitors' concerns must be reported to a key social worker and a named child protection nurse; health visiting assessments must be in addition to other meetings; \u0095 GPs and staff in minor injuries units should have child protection training - with updates; \u0095 When a hospital doctor is assessing a child for abuse, they should check that the social worker understands their concerns and should discuss them with the social work manager, if necessary. A paediatric consultant should be called if there are serious concerns; \u0095 Staff should get clinical supervision. Report recommendations to probation service: \u0095 A parent with a child on the child protection register who is aso an offender under supervision should be classified as risk alert; \u0095 Case manager or senior probation officer should attend every child protection case conference; \u0095 Supervision of offenders should be reviewed after each case conference; \u0095 All probation officers should get foundation child protection training; those working on child protection cases should attend ACPC training.",

Professional sport does operate on merit and the free market really works, not least against racism. </p> <p>Clubs want to win.

I would say that it is quite obviously because of historical and cultural reasons. \"Vive la diff\u00e9rence\" is a fruitful slogan in sport; and it's just as cheering that good little ones can beat big ones. For generations past, New Zealand has produced world-beating rugby teams, and Argentine football teams have often beaten Brazil which has five times the population.

One of the happier memories from the days when the sun never set on the British empire and we held dominion over palm and pine is of \"Ranji\", \"Duleep\" and the Nawab of Pataudi playing cricket for England (albeit with somewhat flimsy national qualifications).

      "bodyText": "A Santiago appeals court today threw out murder and kidnapping charges against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, but said the retired general could still be tried on charges he covered up the crimes. The Santiago court of appeals ruled 2-1 to throw out the more serious charges. General Pinochet had been indicted and placed under house arrest on Jan. 29 on charges stemming from the \"Caravan of Death,\" one of the most notorious cases of human rights abuses during his 1973-90 dictatorship. The caravan was a military group that executed 75 political prisoners shortly after the 1973 coup led by Gen Pinochet. The remains of 18 of the victims were never recovered. Gen Pinochet's lawyers appealed, calling the homicide and kidnapping charges against him \"arbitrary, illegal, and unconstitutional.\" Gen Pinochet lawyer Pablo Rodriguez argued that there was no clear evidence Pinochet was responsible for the killings and that the 85-year-old former dictator was not healthy enough to stand trial. Plaintiffs, human rights activists and relatives of the victims claim the members of the caravan acted on Gen Pinochet's orders. Gen Pinochet remains under house arrest at his countryside residence in Bucalemu, 80 miles south-west of Santiago. Prosecution lawyers and relatives of victims of repression under Pinochet reacted with disappointment to the new ruling in the long legal saga involving the former strongman. \"This is shameful and shows the kind of courts we have,\" said Viviana Diaz, president of an organisation of relatives of dissidents who disappeared after being arrested by Pinochet's security services. Prosecution lawyer Hiram Villagra said the ruling at least \"confirms that Pinochet had participation in the criminal acts\". But it cannot be considered as a mere cover up, because Pinochet gave the orders,\" Villagra said. Lawyer Carmen Hertz, a member of the prosecution team and widow of one of the victims of the caravan, said \"we are not satisfied, of course, but the ruling still means that Pinochet is considered a criminal.\" Another prosecution lawyer, Hugo Gutierres, said he and his colleagues will take a few days to decide on their next steps.

      "body": "<p>The future of popular internet portal Yahoo! was thrown into doubt last night after trading in its shares in the US was unexpectedly suspended. </p> <p>Amid a whirlwind of speculation and rumour, analysts said they thought Yahoo! was preparing to issue either a profits warning, details of senior management changes or possibly news that it was being taken over. </p> <p>Yahoo! shares dropped sharply in early trading before dealing was halted, leaving them valued at $20.97 each - their lowest level since 1998. </p> <p>The Santa Clara, California-based firm refused to comment on the reason behind the suspension but said it was planning to host a conference call for analysts and the media later in the evening. </p> <p>Henry Blodget, the Merrill Lynch analyst who was formerly one of the sector's most bullish watchers, released a note to clients speculating on a number of possible scenarios, including a profits warning or a takeover. </p> <p>One theory gaining wide circulation was that Yahoo! may be about to sign a major strategic alliance with Vivendi, the French media company, which is selling its stake in AOL France. </p> <p>There was also talk that Tim Koogle, the chairman and chief executive of Yahoo!, may be about to quit after disagreements over the company's strategic direction. A formal link-up with eBay has also been rumoured. </p> <p>\"Given the recent executive departures, the rough economic environment and the emerging consensus that a recovery will be gradual, we would not be surprised if Yahoo! were entertaining offers,\" said Mr Blodget. </p> <p>Viacom, Bertelsmann, News Corporation and Walt Disney Company are seen as alternative possible suitors. </p> <p>Rumours that an important announcement was about to emerge from Yahoo! began circulating after it unexpectedly pulled out of an appearance at a Merrill Lynch conference scheduled for today. Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang added to the confusion by cancelling a speech at another conference in Utah yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Blodget suggested that Yahoo! could give also guidance on its earnings or announce a restructuring following a slump in its share price over the past year. \"To our knowledge Yahoo! has never cancelled the day before a conference. As a result, it seems prudent to review the usual reasons that lead to such cancellations,\" he said. </p> <p>Advertising fees account for around 90% of the company's revenues and analysts believe that the softening in advertising spend over the past few months could force the firm to restate its earning estimates. </p> <p>\"It's been a tough quarter for internet advertising, and Yahoo! continues to go through its transition, and they may be coming out with an earnings guidance warning,\" said Abhishek Gami of William Blair &amp; Co. </p> <p>Lowell Singer of Roberston Stephens said: \"It is by no means a slam dunk that Yahoo! will make even the low end of revenue projections.\" </p> <p>Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Wit SoundView, said Yahoo! could even announce a cost-cutting programme which might includes layoffs among its 3,000 staff. </p> <p>Yahoo! has been hit by several senior management changes recently. Last month Fabiola Arredondo, chief executive of Yahoo! Europe, quit to pursue \"private business interests\". The heads of Yahoo! units in Asia and Canada have since followed her out the door. </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo!</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/yil/\">Yahoo! internet life</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ml.com/\">Merrill Lynch</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.vivendi.com/\">Vivendi</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aol.fr/\">AOL France</a> (in French)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.viacom.com/\">Viacom</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bertelsmann.com/\">Bertelsmann</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newscorp.com/\">News Corporation</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.disney.com/\">Walt Disney</a><br></p> <p><strong>Talk about it</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@0@.ee7ff0d/0\">Have your say on the future of Yahoo!</a></p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4148460,00.html\">08.03.2001: 'Black Wednesday' leaves dot.coms reeling</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4148279,00.html\">08.03.2001: Yahoo! deepens dot.com gloom</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4148090,00.html\">07.03.2001: Yahoo! suspends shares</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4146676,00.html\">06.03.2001: Vivendi gives Napster hope</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4137796,00.html\">18.02.2001: Tricks in clicks and mortar</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The future of popular internet portal Yahoo! was thrown into doubt last night after trading in its shares in the US was unexpectedly suspended. Amid a whirlwind of speculation and rumour, analysts said they thought Yahoo! was preparing to issue either a profits warning, details of senior management changes or possibly news that it was being taken over. Yahoo! shares dropped sharply in early trading before dealing was halted, leaving them valued at $20.97 each - their lowest level since 1998. The Santa Clara, California-based firm refused to comment on the reason behind the suspension but said it was planning to host a conference call for analysts and the media later in the evening. Henry Blodget, the Merrill Lynch analyst who was formerly one of the sector's most bullish watchers, released a note to clients speculating on a number of possible scenarios, including a profits warning or a takeover. One theory gaining wide circulation was that Yahoo! may be about to sign a major strategic alliance with Vivendi, the French media company, which is selling its stake in AOL France. There was also talk that Tim Koogle, the chairman and chief executive of Yahoo!, may be about to quit after disagreements over the company's strategic direction. A formal link-up with eBay has also been rumoured. \"Given the recent executive departures, the rough economic environment and the emerging consensus that a recovery will be gradual, we would not be surprised if Yahoo! were entertaining offers,\" said Mr Blodget. Viacom, Bertelsmann, News Corporation and Walt Disney Company are seen as alternative possible suitors. Rumours that an important announcement was about to emerge from Yahoo! began circulating after it unexpectedly pulled out of an appearance at a Merrill Lynch conference scheduled for today. Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang added to the confusion by cancelling a speech at another conference in Utah yesterday. Mr Blodget suggested that Yahoo! could give also guidance on its earnings or announce a restructuring following a slump in its share price over the past year. \"To our knowledge Yahoo! has never cancelled the day before a conference. As a result, it seems prudent to review the usual reasons that lead to such cancellations,\" he said. Advertising fees account for around 90% of the company's revenues and analysts believe that the softening in advertising spend over the past few months could force the firm to restate its earning estimates. \"It's been a tough quarter for internet advertising, and Yahoo! continues to go through its transition, and they may be coming out with an earnings guidance warning,\" said Abhishek Gami of William Blair &amp; Co. Lowell Singer of Roberston Stephens said: \"It is by no means a slam dunk that Yahoo! will make even the low end of revenue projections.\" Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Wit SoundView, said Yahoo! could even announce a cost-cutting programme which might includes layoffs among its 3,000 staff. Yahoo! has been hit by several senior management changes recently. Last month Fabiola Arredondo, chief executive of Yahoo! Europe, quit to pursue \"private business interests\". The heads of Yahoo! units in Asia and Canada have since followed her out the door. Useful links Yahoo!

This week's bombshell is that the Unity caucus in the Duma or lower house - the Kremlin's parliamentary instrument - is threatening to join the communists in tabling a no confidence motion in the government of prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov. The move has taken everyone by surprise, including most MPs themselves. Moscow's political class has gone into analytical overdrive, rehearsing multiple scenarios and speculating feverishly on the Byzantine political calculations behind the decision, which could bring down the government, see parliament dissolved and necessitate new parliamentary elections. This may be much ado about nothing. But then again, to extend the Shakespeare reference, the knives could be coming out for the ides of March. The initial Unity announcement provoked gasps of astonishment and a big row within the party. Then the leadership rowed back and said no final decision on whether to vote down the government would be taken until 13 March, the eve of the scheduled no confidence motion. Many of the political elite will be watching their backs. But the next week could also entail an orgy of backroom horse trading to avert the collapse of the government and early elections. It is not clear where Mr Putin stands. The communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, went to discuss the row with him in the Kremlin on Wednesday evening.

It was the communists, marginally the biggest caucus in the parliament, who first raised the no confidence issue a couple of weeks ago. For the past year they have been broadly supportive of the Kremlin - the very opposite of their position during the Boris Yeltsin years - and the u-turn a fortnight ago was taken as a sign that the communists were reverting to their habitual opposition role. But it was the Unity move that stunned the pundits. Created only 18 months ago, Unity is widely seen as a Putin poodle. It is barely credible that the party leaders could vote down the government without the president's discreet backing. But the parliamentary leader, Boris Gryzlov, was out of the country when the bombshell was dropped. Of the various theories advanced to explain the no confidence move, a favourite has it that Mr Putin wants to streamline and marshal his parliamentary power base and reshuffle the cabinet while he remains hugely popular. If the vote of no confidence succeeds, a second vote is needed within three months which, if successful, obliges Mr Putin to fire the government or dissolve the Duma and order new elections.

European rivals Terra Networks fell 4% in early trading and Germany's T-Online shed 2% as wary investors reacted to the shock news. The UK's Freeserve also tumbled 4% this morning. Yahoo's warning last night that 2001 results will fall well short of forecasts - some 45% less than last quarter to only \u00a3125m - was nicely capped off with the news that its chairman and CEO Tim Koogle had resigned. While the revenue decline was not entirely unexpected, the market was hoping for some kind of upturn later this year. Now it appears any upturn for internet businesses is at least 12 months off, with the likelihood of a procession of high-profile dot.com failures before then.

Finding a replacement for Mr Koogle should not be difficult - his job comes with a salary of \u00a3300,000 and a healthy wedge of stock options - but finding fresh talent to revive the business is going to be difficult. Yahoo!'s bread and butter is advertising revenue, and as everyone now knows, internet advertising revenues are just not big enough anymore. Alongside a weaking market position, Yahoo!'s only option now is to forge a deal with a traditional media company such as AOL Time Warner and move away from being looked upon as just an internet company. Disney has been seen as a possible partner for Yahoo!, but Disney boss Michael Eisner was said to have turned down a merger because the asking price too high.

      "bodyText": "The frailty of the deal ITV struck with watchdogs over News at Ten was exposed today after it emerged the station plans to screen the bulletin at 10pm on just two occasions in one week in March. When the bulletin was restored to the schedules in January, viewers were led to believe that Sir Trevor McDonald would be on air at least three days a week. However, it has emerged that the Independent Television Commission deal actually means something different. In what will be seen as one of the law's finest get-out clauses in TV regulation, ITV was only required to show the news \"on average\" three days a week. \"Their plans to schedule the news on just two days a week would not present a problem because of the nature of the deal was that they would only be expected to screen the news 'on average' of three nights a week. It was thought this would give them a degree of flexibility,\" said an ITC spokesman. He added however that ITV, under the rules, would have to compensate for the lack of News at Ten bulletins in the schedule at a later date. ITV will drop its 10pm News at Ten on three nights of the week starting March 19. It is delaying the bulletin by 15 minutes to make way for an edition of prison drama Bad Girls on one night, while on a second night in the same week it is being delayed by half-an-hour for another drama, The Hunt. Friday March 23 is also without a News at Ten, but ITV bosses were given the go-ahead to drop the news on Fridays as part of the controversial compromise struck with watchdogs last September. However, it has been given the go-ahead to do this because it is screening News at Ten on four nights a week next week. The move has given further ammunition to the BBC where executives say viewers no longer know when to expect the news. \"It's not News at Ten. This is News at When. This surely goes against the spirit of the ITC rules and certainly is confusing for viewers,\" said one executive. An ITV spokeswoman said the BBC was showing \"complete disdain and lack of respect for viewers\". She pointed out that last night ITV screened the news at 10.15pm but still won nearly 6m viewers - almost 2m more than that of the BBC's Ten O'Clock News. \"If the BBC want to say its News at When, that's fine. In our view the figures show it's News at When the viewers want it,\" she said. \"The BBC are just being spiteful and mischievous. They didn't point out that we were showing News at Ten on four nights a week next week when they decided to stir this row up. \"This is perfectly within the rules because we are allowed flexibility on 52 nights in the year as long as we maintain News at Ten on average three nights per week. \"It just so happens that we are delaying the news for a special 75-minute edition of Bad Girls, which was commissioned long before the News at Ten deal was done. Viewers would not appreciate if we interuppted it 60 minutes in. \"If the BBC want to say its News at When, that's fine. In our view the figures show its News at When the viewers want it. \"If you look at last night as a very recent example. 5.9m watched at 10.15pm while the BBC's News at Ten got 4.3m. Viewers are anything but confused.\" The ITC warned that if audiences fall as a result of the erratic schedule it would have to intervene.",

      "body": "<p><strong>I have a very itchy, scaly scalp, and often have flakes of dandruff on my collar. My doctor said it might be psoriasis and gave me a treatment called Dovonex. It hasn't worked and the itching and flaking are driving me mad. </strong></p> <p>It could be psoriasis, but it might not be. Psoriasis is a skin condition that often runs in families, can cause scaly patches on elbows, knees and elsewhere, and can involve joints and nails. Scalp treatments include tar shampoos, steroid lotions such as Betnovate, and the relatively new Dovonex. Perhaps you've actually got seborrhoeic dermatitis. This makes lots of people a bit flaky. It causes dandruff, red eyes, red patches down the middle of the face and red, scaly patches in the body's crevices - armpits, groins and under breasts. It's a cross between psoriasis and eczema and is often misdiagnosed as both. As with most common skin conditions, no one has a clue what really causes it. A fungus which usually lives on the skin, P ovale, seems responsible in many cases and contributes to the itching. Treatment with Nizoral shampoo helps the scaling, though it can bounce back, especially when you're stressed. </p> <p><strong>My 15-year-old daughter has been dieting for the past year. She has undoubtedly shed her puppy fat and looks fashionably trim now. She says she's eating plenty and realises she doesn't need to lose any weight now. How can I be sure that she's not letting her dieting get out of control and sliding into anorexia?</strong> </p> <p>You're right to be worried. Up to 10% of all adolescent girls in the UK are thought to have an eating disorder, and 1-2% have anorexia. On the plus side, 98% of UK adolescents are never going to be anorexic. Four factors make the diagnosis: weight that is less than 85% of ideal body weight; an intense fear of becoming overweight; distorted body image; and no periods for at least three months. If you have a good relationship with your daughter, you may be able to ask her for this information. But if she has anorexia, she may be reluctant to tell you the truth. If you suspect she is sliding towards an eating disorder, get expert help. Pointers to anorexia may be that she's exercising excessively, getting obsessed with food, feeling cold, tired and weak, and looking increasingly skinny. The specialist help will aim to treat any physical problems created by the anorexia, set targets for regaining weight, help her with relationship problems and offer therapy to work on her distorted body image. With help, half the girls with anorexia recover fully, just under half remain uncomfortable with food and have some sort of eating disorder, and one in 20 die. </p> <p><strong> It's only March and my hay fever is in full swing. Is there anything new under the sun? </strong> </p> <p>March hay fever means you're probably allergic to birch pollen. Ideally, you'd avoid birches, but if you're like me and can just about tell a tree from a lamppost, forget it. Most hay fever sufferers are also allergic to grass pollen, which is easier to identify but harder to avoid. Keep bedroom windows closed as pollen counts rise, especially from mid-afternoon onwards. Ideally, move to the seaside where counts are lower. Wear wraparound sunglasses to keep pollen out of your eyes, and point ventilation vents in cars away from your face. The earlier you start your hay fever treatments, the better. Start with nose and eye drops, and build up to oral antihistamines if needs be (eg loratidine, cetirizine or fexofenadine). Nasal steroids work well if you get them up your nostrils as opposed to squirting them straight down your throat. Oral steroids are good in extreme cases such as job interviews or A-levels. Desensitisation (immunotherapy), which uses injections of increasing strengths of pollen extracts to build up immunity, works well but had a bad press due to a few fatal allergic reactions. It can be great but can only safely be given in a hospital setting - you wouldn't want to have densensitisation without a full resuscitation crew on hand. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help. If you have a question for Dr Robinson, email <a href=\"mailto:drann@dircon.co.uk\">drann@dircon.co.uk</a> or write to her c/o The Health Editor, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.

While Dr Jonathan S Reiner, the cardiologist who cleared his blocked artery, cheerily says he's not limiting Cheney's workload, you have to ask whether a 60-year-old who has already had quadruple bypass surgery shouldn't be putting his feet up away from the stress of politics. </p> <p>Cheney had his first heart attack at just 37 (suggesting that they may run in his family) while campaigning for Congress in Washington. His last heart attack, on November 22 last year, was during the stressful election vote recount in Florida. Yet Dr Reiner is still upbeat. \"The symptoms were subtle this time. There is a very high likelihood he can finish out his term in his full vigorous capacity.\" The Russians, you will recall, used to say the same about President Yeltsin. </p> <p>But although heart attacks do scar the muscle and reduce its pumping ability, many people return to full work and live long, happy lives. \"While no heart attack is minor, some are more severe than others,\" says Gaynor Dewsnap of the British Heart Foundation. \"If there is a blockage higher up in the coronary artery it would mean it was more severe.\" </p> <p>On this occasion it seems that Cheney did not have a heart attack (in which the blood supply to an area of the heart is cut off and that portion of heart muscle dies). Instead, the blood vessel in his heart that is kept open by a metal stent (tube) was beginning to silt up, which happens in 20% of people with stents. As soon as he felt pains in his chest - a crucial warning sign - he rushed himself into hospital. The blockage was released using a tiny balloon threaded into the artery. </p> <p>Like many veterans of heart attacks, Cheney will be on a rehabilitation programme. \"When someone's had a heart attack they often get more conscientious about their health - what they eat and the exercise they take. They will have had surgery or be on drugs to reduce the risk of another heart attack,\" says Dewsnap. \"Some people can be healthier than before their heart attack, although four attacks is a lot for anyone, because the muscle can't regrow and every attack you have damages the muscle more.\" </p> <p>Although Cheney has had his main coronary arteries operated on, this doesn't necessarily mean that his heart is about to stop. Surgery that restores the flow of blood to the heart reduces the risk of dying from heart disease for at least 10 years after the operation. </p> <p>The BHF recommends that, rather than retire to bed and wait for further chest pain, heart attack victims should take mild exercise for 30 minutes five times a week. Cheney could do worse than take regular strolls round the White House or play a leisurely round of golf. And he should avoid hamburger joints. Those who have suffered a heart attack should reduce the risk of further coronaries by eating healthily - five servings of fruit and vegetables, less fat, and oily fish once a week. </p> <p>While Cheney is said to be a perfect patient, how can he reduce the stress of being the vice-president? His working hours are likely to remain long and unrelaxing. The evidence that stress can cause heart attacks is quite compelling. It's known that earthquakes and wars increase the rate of heart attacks, although not in people who don't already have some heart disease. Stress causes a rush of adrenalin that increases the body's demands on the heart and may also tip the heart into an abnormal rhythm. This stress does not have to be acute. A study from Japan of 195 men who had heart attacks found that working for more than 11 hours a day was a risk factor. </p> <p>Cheney must also be careful not to relieve the stresses of his working day with more than the occasional glass of beer. Research from Finland, looking at more than 1,500 beer-drinking men, found an increased risk of dying in men swigging more than six bottles a session. But most limiting of all, he may need to avoid sports events. A study of Dutch men found that those who watched their football team being eliminated from the European football championship in 1996 had an increased risk of dying shortly afterwards from a heart attack.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I was nine years old when I realised there was more to food than food. Food represented something about the way you saw yourself and others saw you. In every sense, you were what you ate - or didn't eat. I was in hospital, being investigated for a long-term illness. The doctors didn't believe I was ill. They thought I was a school-dodging malingerer and gave me funny looks. The longer they investigated me, the more they gave me those funny looks. </p> <p>I had been a well-built lad. Tubby, you could say. Loved my cakes, fish and chips, crisps and chocolate. Until I woke up one day with a sore throat and a blinding headache, and feeling sick. So I didn't eat because it only made me feel more sick. After a month or so, I still wouldn't eat - not so much because I felt sick but because this was proof that I was poorly. The healthy me would stuff himself all day long, so the sick me wouldn't eat a thing. </p> <p>Eight stone quickly became seven and then six. The skinnier I became the more beautiful I looked in my mirror. Eventually, I was four-and-a-half stone of skin and bone and bloated tummy. I looked in the mirror and couldn't believe how gorgeous I was. I had no bottom, no wrists, no muscles, and every stripe of my multicoloured jumper matched a jutting rib. </p> <p>No one called it anorexia 30 years ago - not even if you were a girl, let alone a boy. The nurses woke in the middle of the night to pour banana Complan down my throat, which I puked up. I hid food, poured it down the loo, passed it on to kids sharing the ward. </p> <p>Gradually, as the weeks turned into months and the months turned into years, I started eating again. My mum and dad were delighted as my weight crept up. I was devastated. Back up to six stone, I felt fat and ugly. Weight became a measure of how much better I was getting and how quickly. And if you've been ill for years, cocooned in a bedroom or hospital ward, the thought of getting better is the most frightening thing in the world. </p> <p>But I did get better, and one of the things for which I was eternally grateful to my illness was my skinnyness. Throughout my teens I could eat what I wanted without putting on weight. I was back on the fish and chips, cakes and chocolate, just like when I was a kid; the only difference now was that I could take it. So I stopped worrying about food. When I heard of women who were anorexic, I was interested because I knew we shared something. I talked about it in the past tense because it was an old problem suffered by the old me. A character blip brought on by illness. </p> <p>But now I'm not so sure. In the past few years I've become concerned with weight again, but this time it's different. I've changed and the world has changed. I'm in my late 30s, my metabolism is slowing down, love handles and a paunch have visited for the first time. Only natural, hey? Just like my dad's generation and his dad's before that. Which is the problem. The paunch and love handles are no longer the norm for my generation - or at least not the norm in terms of what we see in mags and on telly. Nowadays, the norm is David Beckham and Robbie Williams stripped off to their six pack, or the man in the advert whose body is so perfect that the beautiful woman has to lick the ice cream off it. Today, it's not just athletes and pop stars who have to fulfil the phwoaah! factor. Go into any number of pubs, restaurants and gyms, and it's pretty obvious that men have been employed for their looks. Not that we complain. Men have employed women on the same basis for ever. </p> <p>The first time I noticed my belly I went into denial. For months I was convinced I had stomach cancer. Perhaps it was arrogance. I can't have a paunch, I'm not that kind of person! Then there was the time on a beach when my friend looked at my trunks and my overhang, and said, \"Cor! You're all man aren't you!\" At first I thought it was a compliment. And then I realised. Bastard. Fattist bastard. </p> <p>It took about a year to accept that it wasn't cancer. I got on the scales, and they shrieked 13 stone at me. I was distraught: here we were in the 21st century and you still couldn't get a decent pair of scales. I shook them, moved them round the bathroom to somewhere lighter, cheated them down to just below the zero mark, went to my neighbours' house to weigh myself, took every single item of clothing off - 12:12 it said. </p> <p>I decided to get fit - football, running, tennis. But that led to another problem - new muscles, extra weight. So it was down to simple dieting, old style. And this is where nothing had changed. I think I was typically male - I wanted to lose weight, wanted to look good, but like so many boy-men didn't have a clue what to do. So I gave up breakfast and slapped myself on the back. Gave up lunch and gave myself an extra slap. Sometimes I didn't even have tea, and I thought this was the ultimate in healthy living. </p> <p>By midnight I'd be starving. But I'd be so chuffed with my self-control that I'd give myself a little treat. So I made myself a curry. And some chocolate pudding. And a couple of packets of crisps. And a pot of coffee. And it's pointless having a pot of coffee if you've got no choccies to complement them. And the funny thing was that by the time I'd finished the coffee I felt so alive and kicking that I'd sit down to watch the early-morning telly with a plate of cheese and biscuits. I didn't lose weight. </p> <p>In the past few months, I've started to get my act together. I occasionally dabble in fruit for breakfast, try to eat regularly through the day, restrict myself to a cereal (well, a cereal and bar chocolate) at midnight, and have stopped weighing myself every day. I think it may be working. The other day I looked in the mirror, and I knew, just knew, that I was thinner than last time. My stomach certainly wasn't flat, but it was flatter. I looked again. Somehow the belly of substance now looked insipid and wimpy. I thought about the famous actress who told me that she loved her man for his paunch and had never ever loved anyone for their flat belly. I looked in the mirror again, and wasn't pleased with what I saw. Skinny bastard.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Find yourself tapping your foot all the time? Or clicking your fingers? Do you get bored easily? And find it hard to concentrate? Do you often make careless mistakes? </p> <p>These may all be symptoms of the adult version of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We have become relatively comfortable with the theory that increasing numbers of children may be so boisterous, impulsive and difficult to deal with that they are actually ill (although not everyone agrees on this). But until recently it was thought that the condition, which may affect as many as 5% of British children, disappeared during adolescence thanks to brain development and hormonal changes. </p> <p>Now, however, some scientists and doctors believe that it can persist in later life. Edwina Mitchell, 38, is one of the few adults to have been formally diagnosed: she was told she had adult ADHD last year. \"It was such a bloody relief,\" she says. \"I've got a label now for what was going on. I had no idea what was wrong with me. I was frequently diagnosed as suffering with depression, but when I read about depression the symptoms never quite seemed to fit. </p> <p>\"You can't engage a person with depression, stimulate them or make them laugh. When you've got someone who's got ADHD, they may seem quiet and subdued, but if you can get their attention, you watch the way they come right up. The moment I found something to engage in, like adult education, decorating, sewing or knitting, then I'm happy, right up there.\" </p> <p>The first thing you notice about Mitchell is that she talks very fast, and for lengthy periods. \"My biggest problem is that people always misinterpret me as being aggressive. That has reduced me to tears on a number of occasions, because I'm not aggressive.\" She is also a fidget, and constantly plays with a ball of tissue to give her hands something to do. She gets easily bored, finds it hard to remember things, is frequently distracted and needs to write copious lists in order to keep her life organised. Mitchell is impulsive, and tact is certainly not a forte. \"I can't help it. I speak the truth. If someone says, 'Do I look a sack of shit in this?', they'll get: 'Yes you do.' You can imagine how many problems that causes.\" </p> <p>Like many adult ADHD sufferers, Mitchell has a long history of childhood difficulties. Socially isolated at school, she often played truant and was seen as a troublemaker. Doctors diagnosed depression when she was 12 and by 14 she was expelled and pronounced ineducable. She started to take drugs as a teenager. </p> <p>\"American research shows that children who don't get treatment may as adults self-medicate on illicit substances,\" says Dr Clive Jones, a neuroscientist at University College London. Mitchell's chosen drug was speed, which has the paradoxicaleffect of slowing ADHD sufferers down. \"Speed used to leave me quiet and at peace. People used to laugh: 'Give her some speed and shut her up.'\" </p> <p>Mitchell married at 17, only to divorce and raise her two sons alone. She has never had a job, probably, in part, because she comes across badly in interviews. \"I frighten them to death,\" she says. </p> <p>Adult education through the Open University has been her salvation. She threw herself into her studies with the type of high energy typical of ADHD people, although she had enormous difficulties remembering information and structuring essays. It was thought she might be dyslexic, and it was during a test for dyslexia that an educational psychologist suggested that she might have ADHD. </p> <p>\"I'd never heard of it,\" says Mitchell. Nor had any of the mental health services in her area. Her GP was unable to find anyone on the NHS to do a diagnostic test, and in the end her university paid for her to have a private assessment at the Marchwood Priory Hospital in Southampton. Once a positive diagnosis was obtained, her GP was at a loss as to how to help. \"He said, 'If you bring me the information, I'll act upon it.'\" Mitchell and her partner trawled the internet and came up with a list of drugs used in the US, one of which was Dexedrine, an amphetamine-based drug. \"I told him I wanted to try that one - it was what I abused as a teenager.\" </p> <p>Dr Brian Toone, consultant psychiatrist at the Maudsley hospital, is one of the few psychiatrists who treats adults with ADHD. He says that medication is the most effective treatment. Most are prescribed Ritalin (methylphenidate hydrochloride), the same amphetamine-based drug used for hyperactive children. It is thought to work by stimulating parts of the brain that are under-functioning. </p> <p>Amphetamine is very similar in composition to some of the neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and noradrenaline, which occur naturally in the brain. One theory is that children and adults with hyperactivity have an abnormality in the shape of the receptor molecules on the surface of the nerve cells to which the transmitters attach themselves. According to Dr Toone, who has so far seen 200 adult patients, more than half respond well to drug treatment. </p> <p>Mitchell now takes her medication when she feels under pressure. \"I find it slows me down.

      "bodyText": "Find yourself tapping your foot all the time? Or clicking your fingers? Do you get bored easily? And find it hard to concentrate? Do you often make careless mistakes? These may all be symptoms of the adult version of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We have become relatively comfortable with the theory that increasing numbers of children may be so boisterous, impulsive and difficult to deal with that they are actually ill (although not everyone agrees on this). But until recently it was thought that the condition, which may affect as many as 5% of British children, disappeared during adolescence thanks to brain development and hormonal changes. Now, however, some scientists and doctors believe that it can persist in later life. Edwina Mitchell, 38, is one of the few adults to have been formally diagnosed: she was told she had adult ADHD last year. \"It was such a bloody relief,\" she says. \"I've got a label now for what was going on. I had no idea what was wrong with me. I was frequently diagnosed as suffering with depression, but when I read about depression the symptoms never quite seemed to fit. \"You can't engage a person with depression, stimulate them or make them laugh. When you've got someone who's got ADHD, they may seem quiet and subdued, but if you can get their attention, you watch the way they come right up. The moment I found something to engage in, like adult education, decorating, sewing or knitting, then I'm happy, right up there.\" The first thing you notice about Mitchell is that she talks very fast, and for lengthy periods. \"My biggest problem is that people always misinterpret me as being aggressive. That has reduced me to tears on a number of occasions, because I'm not aggressive.\" She is also a fidget, and constantly plays with a ball of tissue to give her hands something to do. She gets easily bored, finds it hard to remember things, is frequently distracted and needs to write copious lists in order to keep her life organised. Mitchell is impulsive, and tact is certainly not a forte. \"I can't help it. I speak the truth. If someone says, 'Do I look a sack of shit in this?', they'll get: 'Yes you do.' You can imagine how many problems that causes.\" Like many adult ADHD sufferers, Mitchell has a long history of childhood difficulties. Socially isolated at school, she often played truant and was seen as a troublemaker. Doctors diagnosed depression when she was 12 and by 14 she was expelled and pronounced ineducable. She started to take drugs as a teenager. \"American research shows that children who don't get treatment may as adults self-medicate on illicit substances,\" says Dr Clive Jones, a neuroscientist at University College London. Mitchell's chosen drug was speed, which has the paradoxicaleffect of slowing ADHD sufferers down. \"Speed used to leave me quiet and at peace. People used to laugh: 'Give her some speed and shut her up.'\" Mitchell married at 17, only to divorce and raise her two sons alone. She has never had a job, probably, in part, because she comes across badly in interviews. \"I frighten them to death,\" she says. Adult education through the Open University has been her salvation. She threw herself into her studies with the type of high energy typical of ADHD people, although she had enormous difficulties remembering information and structuring essays. It was thought she might be dyslexic, and it was during a test for dyslexia that an educational psychologist suggested that she might have ADHD. \"I'd never heard of it,\" says Mitchell. Nor had any of the mental health services in her area. Her GP was unable to find anyone on the NHS to do a diagnostic test, and in the end her university paid for her to have a private assessment at the Marchwood Priory Hospital in Southampton. Once a positive diagnosis was obtained, her GP was at a loss as to how to help. \"He said, 'If you bring me the information, I'll act upon it.'\" Mitchell and her partner trawled the internet and came up with a list of drugs used in the US, one of which was Dexedrine, an amphetamine-based drug. \"I told him I wanted to try that one - it was what I abused as a teenager.\" Dr Brian Toone, consultant psychiatrist at the Maudsley hospital, is one of the few psychiatrists who treats adults with ADHD. He says that medication is the most effective treatment. Most are prescribed Ritalin (methylphenidate hydrochloride), the same amphetamine-based drug used for hyperactive children. It is thought to work by stimulating parts of the brain that are under-functioning. Amphetamine is very similar in composition to some of the neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and noradrenaline, which occur naturally in the brain. One theory is that children and adults with hyperactivity have an abnormality in the shape of the receptor molecules on the surface of the nerve cells to which the transmitters attach themselves. According to Dr Toone, who has so far seen 200 adult patients, more than half respond well to drug treatment. Mitchell now takes her medication when she feels under pressure. \"I find it slows me down. I can write better essays, and am more able to focus. I feel happier and more contented.\" How to tell if you have ADHD Distinguishing genuine ADHD from normal energetic behaviour is a tricky business.

      "body": "<p>\"If you live in America, you need to speak English.\" According to a Los Angeles Times poll, that was how three out of four voters explained their support for Proposition 227, the 1998 ballot initiative that dismantled bilingual education in California. Many Arizonans cited the same reason for passing a similar measure (Proposition 203) last year.</p> <p>Ambiguous as it is, this rationale offers some clues about the way Americans think about language. No doubt for some the statement has a patriotic subtext: one flag, one language. Rejecting bilingual education was a way to \"send a message\" that, in the United States, English and only English is appropriate for use in the public square.</p> <p>Other voters merely seemed intent on restating the obvious. English is so dominant in the US that non-English speakers are at a huge disadvantage. Thus schools must not fail to teach English to children from minority language backgrounds. Students' life chances will depend to a large extent on the level of English literacy skills they achieve.</p> <p>Immigrants have generally understood these truths more keenly than anyone, and behaved accordingly. As the linguist Einar Haugen observes, \"America's profusion of tongues has made her a modern Babel, but a Babel in reverse.\"</p> <p>There is no reason to think the historic pattern has changed. Although the number of minority language speakers has grown dramatically in recent years, thanks to a liberalisation of immigration laws in 1965, so has their rate of acculturation. Census figures confirm the paradox. While one in seven US residents now speaks a language other than English at home, bilingualism is also on the rise.

      "bodyText": "\"If you live in America, you need to speak English.\" According to a Los Angeles Times poll, that was how three out of four voters explained their support for Proposition 227, the 1998 ballot initiative that dismantled bilingual education in California. Many Arizonans cited the same reason for passing a similar measure (Proposition 203) last year. Ambiguous as it is, this rationale offers some clues about the way Americans think about language. No doubt for some the statement has a patriotic subtext: one flag, one language. Rejecting bilingual education was a way to \"send a message\" that, in the United States, English and only English is appropriate for use in the public square. Other voters merely seemed intent on restating the obvious. English is so dominant in the US that non-English speakers are at a huge disadvantage. Thus schools must not fail to teach English to children from minority language backgrounds. Students' life chances will depend to a large extent on the level of English literacy skills they achieve. Immigrants have generally understood these truths more keenly than anyone, and behaved accordingly. As the linguist Einar Haugen observes, \"America's profusion of tongues has made her a modern Babel, but a Babel in reverse.\" There is no reason to think the historic pattern has changed. Although the number of minority language speakers has grown dramatically in recent years, thanks to a liberalisation of immigration laws in 1965, so has their rate of acculturation. Census figures confirm the paradox. While one in seven US residents now speaks a language other than English at home, bilingualism is also on the rise. A century ago the proportion of non-English speakers was nearly five times as large. As the population becomes increasingly diverse, newcomers seem to be acquiring the national language more rapidly than ever before. The political problem is that many Americans have trouble believing all this. One conservative organisation claims: \"Tragically, many immigrants these days refuse to learn English!

      "bodyText": "Cable operator NTL has sunk further into the red as its \u00a38bn debt burden eats into revenues. The US-listed company is growing at a rate of knots, but the 11 acquisitions it made in the UK over the last 18 months have come at considerable cost. Interest payments on NTL's debt cost the company \u00a3630m last year, taking its pre-tax loss to \u00a31.97bn from a relatively small \u00a3500m in 1999. However, chief executive Barclay Knapp said NTL should achieve its year-end revenue target of \u00a32.6bn after it racked up \u00a31.8bn in sales last year. Mr Knapp added that NTL was well set for 2001 after launching its digital TV service last year and buying Swiss rival Cablecom and the consumer arm of telecoms giant Cable &amp; Wireless. \"We completed the two largest transactions in our company's history, we have launched new products in all our major markets and we have been carrying out an extensive business review to reduce our cost base,\" said Mr Knapp. The company will now concentrate on increasing its revenue per customer figure from \u00a336 this year to \u00a360 in 2003 and winning new customers will become a lower priority. But NTL, with 600,000 subscribers, is still playing catch-up with its rivals in the UK digital TV market. It hopes to raise this figure to 1.25m by year end, leaving it some distance behind market leader BSkyB, which has over 4m digital customers. However, analysts claim NTL has a unique advantage through its ability to offer \"bundled\" services which combine telecoms, TV and the internet. NTL hopes these services will become a growing attraction to the 8.4m households which are now covered by its network. Related story Jan 25: NTL unveils ambitious targets",

It's 10 months since the various parties to the Northern Ireland peace process agreed, in effect, to move forward towards overall - and already belated - implementation of the deal. Decommissioning was an essential component of that deal, and nothing whatever has happened. Come to that, precious little has been done since the Decommissioning Commission - to give it its ludicrous official title - was set up in September 1997 under former Canadian general John de Chastelain. True, the IRA has opened up a couple of its arms dumps, believed to contain some trifling quantities of weapons, to inspection by two international observers, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Martti Ahtisaari of Finland. But they have no official role in the overall process, which has remained becalmed on a sinister sea of mutual recrimination. To many unionists, the problem is as simple as its solution: let the IRA give up its guns and explosives, and then there can be progress on all other fronts.

The chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, said: \"We will not see the disease disappearing at the end of this week and this outbreak is going to last for a long time.\" Fifteen outbreaks confirmed yesterday, including in four previously unaffected counties, and eight more cases this morning, have effectively put an end to faint hopes that the spread of the disease was about to peak. Mr Scudamore added: \"We have such a large number of tracings and movements (of animals) to follow still.\" He said the biggest problem now presenting itself was that the disease seemed to be spreading most rapidly among cattle which have come into contact with sheep carrying the virus. Since the outbreak began more than two weeks ago officials have tirelessly sought to trace the movements of some 100,000 sheep which passed through markets where the disease was believed to have been present. With Britain in the lambing season, Mr Scudamore urged sheep farmers to look out for signs of the disease in their livestock. It could cause an abnormally high rate of death in young lambs and abortions in pregnant sheep. Other classic symptoms are lameness and listlessness. Mr Scudamore appealed for any farmers who bought sheep outside the main sales rings at Longtown market, a focal point for tracing the disease, to contact their local animal health officer as soon as possible. It also emerged that last night's decision to postpone Cheltenham's prestigious horseracing festival could cost up to \u00a310m in lost trade. As many as 175,000 people were due to attend the races next week from as far afield as Ireland and France for one of the main dates of the racing calendar. Meanwhile, the Queen Mother, who is due to attend a race meeting at Sandown Park in Surrey tomorrow, will also have to do her bit to help prevent the spread of the disease. It is believed she will be advised to wear wellies and wade through a bath of disinfectant at the track.

This is in addition to retaining the winter allowance and the free television licence for the over 75s. </p> <p>The minimum income guarantee is to be simplified with one rate for all those who qualify.

It will allow those with lower retirement incomes, which are nevertheless above the basic state pension level, to keep a large proportion of their savings income or income from their company pensions. </p> <p>He said the intention -from 2003 - is to abolish capital rules which penalise pensioners with savings above \u00a33,000, end the weekly means test, and increase the minimum income guarantee by linking this to rises in earnings throughout the next parliament. </p> <p>Age Concern director general Gordon Lishman hailed Mr Brown as the first chancellor in 20 years to raise the basic state pension above the rate of inflation. But he criticised the Treasury for creating a \"massively complex system and endless form filling for pensioners\" who relied on the pension credit and minimum income guarantee. </p> <p>Jack Jones, president of the National Pensioners' Convention, said pensioners wanted a more substantial increase in the basic state pension rather than more means tested benefits. </p> <p> <strong>The Budget in detail</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><strong>Interactive</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><strong>Comment</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><strong>Audio</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><strong>Game</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><strong>Photo gallery</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><strong>Quiz</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><strong>What does it mean for me?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><strong>Public sector Budget analysis</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><strong>Chancellors</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><strong>Special reports</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

The embattled song-swapping service could face further fines of up to \u00a3100,000 per song traded if found guilty of wilful copyright infringement in these latest cases. Rival online music distributor EMusic and the producer of the Grammy awards have now entered the anti-Napster contingency. However, cynics claim the latest suits are merely PR exercises and have come too late in the proceedings to have any merit. Little known outfit EMusic has filed a copyright infringement suit against Napster. It has accused Napster of unfair competition practices because it deals in illegitimately copyrighted material. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which produces Grammies, also issued a writ against Napster. It claimed millions of copies of songs performed by artists such as U2, Madonna and the Eminem at last month's awards were being traded through the service. The new lawsuits could further drain Napster's cash resources. On April 10, a federal court will decide whether all the different lawsuits should be turned into class actions. If this happens, Napster could be inundated with many more legal claims.

      "bodyText": "Jerry Springer is being lined up to present Channel 5's \u00a31m entertainment game show Greed. The broadcaster is close to signing up the renowned US talk show host to front Greed, which will feature the largest cash prize ever offered by Channel 5. Greed is a 60-minute show combining elements of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and The Weakest Link. In each instalment of the 11-part series, teams of five compete for the \u00a31m prize by answering a series of questions. The person answering the first question quickest becomes the team leader. This individual then decides after each round whether the group should continue or take the money and can also overrule answers made by other team members. As the prize money goes up, the questions become more difficult. The team members also get a chance to eliminate each other in a \"terminator\" sudden-death round. Greed is due to go out in the spring. The move forms part of Channel 5's drive to step up its programming performance, as part of a strategy by majority shareholder RTL to increase the broadcaster's audience share. RTL, which owns 65% of Channel 5, has been at loggerheads with United Business Media, owner of the remaining 35% of the broadcaster. United has opposed RTL's demands for big increases in the Channel 5 programming budget. The Greed format is owned by Pearson Television, an RTL subsidiary.

In a letter published in today's Telegraph, Ms Earle described the retailer's new campaign as \"truly abhorrent\". She complained that the giant posters - which carry the slogan \"fcukinkybugger\" - were in the direct eyeline of children looking out of car windows in traffic jams. Ms Earle said the campaign was a \"sad indictment\" of the advertising industry. \"If corporations and their agencies cannot regulate themselves, it is time for stricter regulations to be placed upon them,\" she said. \"I notice the company has deferred from using FCUK in its children's ads,\" she added. \"Perhaps in the current social climate 'FCUK children' is still just beyond the tastelessness of even the French Connection marketing department and its advertising agency.\" Ms Earle's comments will revive the row over the long-running campaign, which has infuriated and delighted in equal measure. The Advertising Standards Authority, which regulates press and poster adverts, today confirmed that it has launched a formal investigation into the campaign after it received more than 30 complaints. The slogan, created by Trevor Beattie, has attracted widespread criticism from both the advertising industry and the regulators. But French Connection founder Stephen Marks credits Mr Beattie's advertising with turning around the fortunes of French Connection to make it one of the few profitable high street fashion chains. Last week, Mr Beattie accused the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre of censorship after it barred the latest commercial from being shown on TV. The film will instead be shown only in cinemas.

The Macedonian president, Boris Trajkovski, played down the latest violence: \"I don't believe that we'll have again the situation here as we have had over the last few days, and we are there only to isolate the presence of these terrorists.\" The Macedonian government, which includes ethnic Albanians, risks alienating its ethnic minority if it adopts tough tactics against the guerrillas, or alienating the Slav majority if it does too little, western diplomats said yesterday. Macedonia has called for a high-level meeting at Nato headquarters in Brussels tomorrow- an indication of its growing concern about the deteriorating security situation. It has criticised the alliance for not taking firmer action earlier and wants a solution involving international troops. Related articles 08.03.2001, world dispatch: Kostunica thwarts western hopes",

Shortly after they met, Watanabe's body was found in a deserted building near Mainali's apartment and the Nepalese man was arrested for murder. Watanabe had led an exceptional double life: by day, she was a high-flying economist for one of Japan's most prestigious companies; by night, a prostitute who turned tricks in Tokyo's sleazy Shibuya district. She walked the streets in Murayama-cho, an area filled with love hotels. Each night after finishing at the office of Tokyo Electric, the graduate from the elite Keio university would have sex with customers in cars, parks or hotel rooms. According to the extensive domestic reportage on the case, she touted for business in a long wig, swigging beer and calling out to businessmen, \"Do you want to play?\" A methodical worker, she kept a detailed record of her clients inclding their names and how much they paid. It suggests that she was a Robin Hood of hookers who would charge Japanese businessmen up to \u00a3300, but only a tenth of this amount to clients from developing nations. Mainali had sex with her on at least two occasions, but any gratitude he might have initially felt at the charitable price must have soon turned to a wish that he'd never met her. He was arrested and tried for murder, the two main pieces of evidence being a condom containing his semen and a pubic hair found near the body, though other unidentified hairs were also found nearby. In April last year, a lower court acquitted Mainali, saying the case against him was flimsy and circumstantial. The judge accepted that the two condom and hair could have been left during a previous liaison. This was a stunning decision in a country where 99.8 per cent of criminal trials end with a conviction, but it did not provide relief for Mainali. As he was preparing to leave his cell, prosecutors won a new order to have him jailed so that he could not leave the country while they appealed the ruling. This imprisonment of a man declared innocent sparked a furious response among human rights groups. \"It's not possible, legally, to detain a person who has been acquitted, but they did it anyway,\" Hideki Morihara of Amnesty International told the Washington Post. \"It's a breach of Japanese law and international law.\" The outrage grew in December, when a high court reversed the previous decision and sentenced Mainali to life imprisonment even though no new evidence had been presented by the prosecution. \"The victim worked for a major company and held a high position,\" said the presiding judge as the Nepalese man screamed out his innocence.

A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister, Tony Blair, now has the report. The inquiry, conducted by Sir Anthony Hammond, is expected to clear Peter Mandelson, the former Northern Ireland secretary, of lying over his part in \u00a31m Millennium Dome donor Srichand Hinduja's passport application. Mr Mandelson resigned in January after apparent inconsistencies emerged in his account of a personal phone call to immigration minister Mike O'Brien about the case. The former minister said he could not remember the conversation but Mr O'Brien, insisted that Mr Mandelson had called. Mr Mandelson was accused of misleading the culture secretary, Chris Smith, (who had to answer a parliamentary question on the subject) and the prime minister's office over the phone call. The report is also likely to exonerate the minister for Europe, Keith Vaz, in his efforts to get a passport for the Hinduja brothers, but will heavily criticise the chaotic and inadequate way in which the home office keeps its records. The Hammond inquiry has found no documentary evidence that the conversation took place. Nor does it appear that any civil servant in the department definitely recalls any verbal reference to the conversation Mr O'Brien cites. But Sir Anthony is likely to conclude the call did, on balance, occur, in part because Mr O'Brien, as a more junior minister at the time, was more likely to recall the conversation than Mr Mandelson.

How tempting with so much cash to knock another 1p off pre-election income tax. It was a 1999 error not repeated because it didn't need to be. Labour has gained in confidence since then and the public mood is with them - pressing for spending, not for tax cuts. </p> <p>This chancellor congratulates himself on long-termism, but after an excellent first act, the end of his story is still unknown, judgment too early to make. For all the feel-good glow each of his budgets brings, there remains the big long-term question. Will he effect a fundamental and long-term shift in Britain's tax and spend regime? The year 2003-2004 is the crunch by which time the spending now laid out must have delivered undeniable results in health, education and transport - with public services proud, well-paid and thrusting ahead for all to see. Current public patience will run out by then. Tory posters reading \"You paid the cash, so where are the nurses/teachers ...\" and so on make people snort with scorn at Tory cheek now - but not by then if change is not everywhere about to be seen. As people get yearly richer, so expectations of public services rise too. Never before has a Labour government produced increases in public investment above trend growth, and yet the big picture is still a history of under-spending. </p> <p>If it turns out that Act One was as good as it ever gets, then this first term was not enough. If recession rolls in on a dark tide from across the Atlantic, then we will look back and wonder how Labour did so little when the times were extraordinarily good. Why so timid, why so slow? The chancellor may have ended boom-and-bust but what we had instead in public spending was bust-and-boom. The depth of that bust is becoming ever more apparent: the price of prudence was painfully high. It will now not be until 2003-4 that Britain returns to the same level of public spending as a proportion of GDP that it inherited in 1997. A killer fact. </p> <p>Of course it is not quite as simple as that. Within that total, the huge sums previously wasted on unemployment and debt interest have been redistributed to excellent effect. But none the less, over any length of time, the amount a country taxes and spends defines fairly accurately the quality of its public service. We will still not be spending nearly enough. It was Tony Blair himself who promised NHS spending would meet the EU average, thus drawing attention to the yawning gap between Europe and Britain in every other public sphere as well. The disastrous failure to spend in 2000 - with a massive \u00a35bn capital undershoot - accidentally added to the time of famine, delaying results. </p> <p>Another killer fact is that, despite the quite radical redistribution by government, the gap between the rich and poor has still widened under Labour. It always happens in prosperous times, but Labour made no attempt to claw back any of the extra income flowing in to top earners - let alone taxing their growing capital wealth. Indeed, capital gains and inheritance taxes have shrunk to insignificance. Let the Tories grumble about Labour's \"45 new stealth taxes\", the big picture is still that the rich are getting richer faster than the rest and the poor are still being left behind. </p> <p>The ongoing comedy of Conservative policy - made not so much on the hoof as in the Magimix - gives Labour the chance to confront the tax question head on. William Hague, excited by George Bush's trillion dollar promise, now says he will make a mind-boggling \u00a3114bn tax cut. Suddenly lurching for a wild west alternative, the Tories now oblige Labour to talk honestly about tax. But an open advocacy of virtuous taxation has always been noticeably lacking in every Gordon Brown budget speech. He has extinguished public demand for tax cuts, but that's only half the battle. Hague's axe-man cuts require a broad and principled case to be made positively for taxes: they are not a \"burden\" if they buy the things that people want. </p> <p>Praise of public wealth can face down the Tory nostrum that we each spend our own money better than the government does. If Labour's 10-year plans work as well as intended, there will be good evidence that public money well-spent buys much more collectively than citizens can each buy individually. But such words never spring easily to the chancellor's lips. This was a prudent budget - no horse-frightening in the City before an election. But future budgets need more radical shifts. Too often New Labour appeases and buys off opposing forces: this third-way strategy makes few friends or permanent changes. Long-term security for a left of centre government comes from persuading the public of the case for higher taxes - not from stealth or subterfuge. On taxes the people will not be fooled for long, but they might be persuaded to pay more.</p>",

There is no hit list.\" Under the rules the Express must undergo a 90-day consultation period if the number of redundancies involves 100 or more staff. However, anything between 20 and 99 redundancies require just 30 days' notice. Before former editor Rosie Boycott left, it was made known that Mr Desmond wanted to bring staffing levels down to those of other papers. He was aghast when he learned that the Mirror operated on a journalistic headcount of just under 300 while the Express had 440 staff. Journalists on the City desk are aggrieved at the extra workload, which comes with no extra staff or resources. And some fear the strategy of making journalists double up across the Express and Star titles could be replicated across other desks such as showbusiness. Shortly after he bought the paper Mr Desmond axed over 60 advertising, marketing and support staff from Express Newspapers, prompting a furious response from Ms Boycott. Under employment legislation, the new owner of a company is obliged to wait for 90 days before making more than 100 staff redundant. This three-month period is nearly up, and Mr Desmond now believes the time has come to wield the axe. Neither Mr Williams nor Mr Desmond was available for comment.",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>What makes us different</strong></p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>What makes us different</strong></p> <p>The Alex are all about youth development and extending a friendly face deep into the community. It must get boring to neutrals at times, but Dario Gradi really has installed a conveyor belt that keeps turning out talented young players. Eleven of this season's U17 squad have just been given three-year professional contracts!</p> <p><strong>The high points</strong></p> <p>Beating Brentford at Wembley in May 1997 to lift us to the First Division was pretty special, but the play-off semi-final a few weeks earlier against Luton has a permanent place in my heart. A passionate encounter, 2-0 down and we came back to win overall, but the Luton fans flooded onto the pitch and applauded us. No trouble, just mutual respect Add to that, we'd lost 6-0 at Kenilworth Road earlier in the season! </p> <p><strong>The low points</strong></p> <p>Thinking that Crewe Alexandra (as we then knew it) was about to come to an end. They announced an alliance with Liverpool in early 1997 and everyone suspected that we'd become a nursery club. And just imagine all those scallies asking to mind yer car for a fiver! But it's not happened, and we have prospered. </p> <p><strong>What's going on at the moment?</strong></p> <p>We have just announced (March 2001) a \u00a3450,000 loss for the last financial year. Small potatoes, especially as we've hardly sold anyone for ages. In fact, that's our strength, slowly building a strong squad without being plunged into debt. We will never buy to survive, and the fans love the fact that Dario Gradi will continue to throw youngsters into the first team. Dean Ashton, just turned 17, has recently played five games and scored three! The future is getting brighter </p> <p><strong>Last match</strong></p> <p>We have just thrashed Tranmere 3-1 at Gresty Road. They might be able to beat Premier League opposition in the cup, but when it comes to the bread and butter of league action they can only afford margarine. They're going down with QPR and Sheffield Wednesday.</p> <p><strong>Next match</strong></p> <p>Birmingham (away) this coming Saturday will be very tough. I doubt they batter us, but we will do well to take a 1-1 draw. I never rule out a late, cheeky goal for the Alex however! </p> <p><strong>Sore point</strong></p> <p>We've run out of moans! The Alex have been slow to react to many things across the years, but most of it has boiled down to prudent housekeeping. We asked for a better club shop - it arrived, eventually, and is slowly getting better. We still don't sell ourselves enough, considering our many good points. Again, there have been recent ticket initiatives and there seems to be a genuine desire to listen to the fans. Wow - can this really be true?</p> <p><strong>The chairman</strong></p> <p>This is starting to get boring. He's a decent bloke. He doesn't poke his nose into Gradi's affairs, and doesn't alienate the fans with ludicrous ideas and suggestions. And no, he doesn't run onto the pitch trying to juggle footballs, despite being a promising footballer in his younger days. Low profile, but effective. Doesn't take a salary! </p> <p><strong>Rivals</strong></p> <p>Unlike Millwall, nobody dislikes us - and we Do care! We enjoy hating the Clayheads (Port Vale and Stoke) but neither can survive in the First Division and now ply their tacky trades in Division Two. Same for Wrexham, Chester and Shrewsbury - all lower division fodder we left behind several years ago. Stockport consider themselves Mancs, so only Nantwich Town can save the local derby - when they rise up from the North West Counties leagues in about 40 years' time! </p> <p><strong>Kit</strong></p> <p>I'd love to see a simple, plain red home shirt. But they continue to tinker, adding bits of white and blue as they (and the manufacturers) see fit. They've also removed the railway wheel from the club bade design (and I don't have to tell you how much that angered the people of a railway town). </p> <p><strong>Merchandise</strong></p> <p>They're not quite innovative enough to have vast arrays of merchandise, so the bulk of it is your standard mugs, scarves and diaries. They was a tacky bed spread at Christmas, but better the local kids falling asleep beneath Alex tat than more expensive Man Utd rubbish!</p> <p><strong>Mascot</strong></p> <p>Grrrrresty the lion, but more like a pussycat. I love violent mascots like Wolfie and Cyril the Swan. Gresty throws sweets to kids at half time (and I never get any) and doesn't fight. The funniest thing I saw was Wolfie tripping Gresty and trying to start a scrap. Gresty didn't want to know, and merely adjusted his ill-fitting head and sloped off with his tail between his legs. We can't be feeding him enough meat.</p> <p><strong>Heroes</strong></p> <p>Dean Ashton (just 17) is already a hero. Local (ish) lad, big, strong and already scores goals. He will play for England and net us several million within two years. </p> <p>As for all-time, I can only talk about player from my era (last 25 years of watching), so Craig Hignett at his best would be hard to beat. </p> <p>Few players from other clubs earn respect, but on the few occasions Niall Quinn played against Crewe he was a quality player. He even chatted to Alex fans in the bar afterwards, and one of my mates' dads (80 years old) threatened to punch him!</p> <p><strong>Villians</strong></p> <p>Colin Cramb (stroppy Jock) came, played, caused bother, saved us, fell out with everyone, promised to be good, and then went to Bury on loan. I thought being sent to Coventry was bad enough! Love him, hate him, wanted him to succeed - he'll never play for Crewe again. Then again </p> <p><strong>The ground</strong></p> <p>Gresty Road: respectable, modest, home. </p> <p><strong>The crowd</strong></p> <p>It's really hotting up at the moment, and soon it should sound like a rowdy library! Yes we're struggling to make some serious noise, but it is improving. We've got a decent drummer, and we used to have a trumpet. Trouble is, the new stand and this all-seater lark split many of the singers up. </p> <p><strong>Local knowledge</strong></p> <p>There's some decent boozers in Crewe, and most see away fans mingling with the Alex fans. The Brunswick, Barrel and Pig (British Lion) are all within staggering distance of the ground. No hotdog stands (apart from when Birmingham bring their own - seriously), but we have got the Chippy of the Year in Crewe town centre. Wow! You must visit the 16-year-old programme sellers (well, probably 15 but I didn't know officer). A posse of five lovelies congregates near the away end entrance. It's worth your admission money alone. </p> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <p>'We Are Crewe' is the other zine, and works closely with SDL. Both monthly, and both a good read at one pound. As for web sites, Crewe FTT (www.fromtheterrace.co.uk) has the quality writing and is updated most days with new articles and decent opinion from the fans.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What makes us different The Alex are all about youth development and extending a friendly face deep into the community. It must get boring to neutrals at times, but Dario Gradi really has installed a conveyor belt that keeps turning out talented young players. Eleven of this season's U17 squad have just been given three-year professional contracts! The high points Beating Brentford at Wembley in May 1997 to lift us to the First Division was pretty special, but the play-off semi-final a few weeks earlier against Luton has a permanent place in my heart. A passionate encounter, 2-0 down and we came back to win overall, but the Luton fans flooded onto the pitch and applauded us. No trouble, just mutual respect Add to that, we'd lost 6-0 at Kenilworth Road earlier in the season! The low points Thinking that Crewe Alexandra (as we then knew it) was about to come to an end. They announced an alliance with Liverpool in early 1997 and everyone suspected that we'd become a nursery club. And just imagine all those scallies asking to mind yer car for a fiver! But it's not happened, and we have prospered. What's going on at the moment? We have just announced (March 2001) a \u00a3450,000 loss for the last financial year. Small potatoes, especially as we've hardly sold anyone for ages. In fact, that's our strength, slowly building a strong squad without being plunged into debt. We will never buy to survive, and the fans love the fact that Dario Gradi will continue to throw youngsters into the first team. Dean Ashton, just turned 17, has recently played five games and scored three! The future is getting brighter Last match We have just thrashed Tranmere 3-1 at Gresty Road. They might be able to beat Premier League opposition in the cup, but when it comes to the bread and butter of league action they can only afford margarine. They're going down with QPR and Sheffield Wednesday. Next match Birmingham (away) this coming Saturday will be very tough. I doubt they batter us, but we will do well to take a 1-1 draw. I never rule out a late, cheeky goal for the Alex however! Sore point We've run out of moans! The Alex have been slow to react to many things across the years, but most of it has boiled down to prudent housekeeping. We asked for a better club shop - it arrived, eventually, and is slowly getting better. We still don't sell ourselves enough, considering our many good points. Again, there have been recent ticket initiatives and there seems to be a genuine desire to listen to the fans. Wow - can this really be true? The chairman This is starting to get boring. He's a decent bloke. He doesn't poke his nose into Gradi's affairs, and doesn't alienate the fans with ludicrous ideas and suggestions. And no, he doesn't run onto the pitch trying to juggle footballs, despite being a promising footballer in his younger days. Low profile, but effective. Doesn't take a salary! Rivals Unlike Millwall, nobody dislikes us - and we Do care! We enjoy hating the Clayheads (Port Vale and Stoke) but neither can survive in the First Division and now ply their tacky trades in Division Two. Same for Wrexham, Chester and Shrewsbury - all lower division fodder we left behind several years ago. Stockport consider themselves Mancs, so only Nantwich Town can save the local derby - when they rise up from the North West Counties leagues in about 40 years' time! Kit I'd love to see a simple, plain red home shirt. But they continue to tinker, adding bits of white and blue as they (and the manufacturers) see fit. They've also removed the railway wheel from the club bade design (and I don't have to tell you how much that angered the people of a railway town). Merchandise They're not quite innovative enough to have vast arrays of merchandise, so the bulk of it is your standard mugs, scarves and diaries. They was a tacky bed spread at Christmas, but better the local kids falling asleep beneath Alex tat than more expensive Man Utd rubbish! Mascot Grrrrresty the lion, but more like a pussycat. I love violent mascots like Wolfie and Cyril the Swan. Gresty throws sweets to kids at half time (and I never get any) and doesn't fight. The funniest thing I saw was Wolfie tripping Gresty and trying to start a scrap. Gresty didn't want to know, and merely adjusted his ill-fitting head and sloped off with his tail between his legs. We can't be feeding him enough meat. Heroes Dean Ashton (just 17) is already a hero. Local (ish) lad, big, strong and already scores goals. He will play for England and net us several million within two years. As for all-time, I can only talk about player from my era (last 25 years of watching), so Craig Hignett at his best would be hard to beat. Few players from other clubs earn respect, but on the few occasions Niall Quinn played against Crewe he was a quality player. He even chatted to Alex fans in the bar afterwards, and one of my mates' dads (80 years old) threatened to punch him! Villians Colin Cramb (stroppy Jock) came, played, caused bother, saved us, fell out with everyone, promised to be good, and then went to Bury on loan. I thought being sent to Coventry was bad enough! Love him, hate him, wanted him to succeed - he'll never play for Crewe again. Then again The ground Gresty Road: respectable, modest, home. The crowd It's really hotting up at the moment, and soon it should sound like a rowdy library! Yes we're struggling to make some serious noise, but it is improving. We've got a decent drummer, and we used to have a trumpet. Trouble is, the new stand and this all-seater lark split many of the singers up. Local knowledge There's some decent boozers in Crewe, and most see away fans mingling with the Alex fans. The Brunswick, Barrel and Pig (British Lion) are all within staggering distance of the ground. No hotdog stands (apart from when Birmingham bring their own - seriously), but we have got the Chippy of the Year in Crewe town centre. Wow! You must visit the 16-year-old programme sellers (well, probably 15 but I didn't know officer). A posse of five lovelies congregates near the away end entrance. It's worth your admission money alone. Links 'We Are Crewe' is the other zine, and works closely with SDL. Both monthly, and both a good read at one pound. As for web sites, Crewe FTT (www.fromtheterrace.co.uk) has the quality writing and is updated most days with new articles and decent opinion from the fans.",

      "bodyText": "Financial Times owner Pearson is looking over its shoulder nervously after US rival Dow Jones posted a drastic profit warning. Dow Jones said advertising revenues at its flagship title the Wall Street Journal fell by a staggering 42% last month. They could fall by the same margin in March. Analysts at SG Securities today downgraded Pearson's shares from \"hold\" to \"underperform\" amid fears the weakening advertising climate in the US will quickly move across the Atlantic. \"Despite advertising providing only 10% of revenue, we remain cautious over a potentially sharper lagged slowdown in global financial advertising stemming from the US,\" said an SG spokesman. Dow Jones is reeling from a softening in the US economy. Fewer flotations mean there are fewer advertisements from banks announcing their participation in the share offerings. The effect of this has been compounded by the financial woes of technology firms - which have reduced their advertising budgets after their clients cut back on IT spending - and the collapse of big-spending dot.com start-ups Dow Jones is cutting jobs and costs to offset the fall in revenues but it admitted forecasting its prospects for the rest of the year would be very difficult. However, a Pearson spokesman brushed off analysts' concerns, saying the Financial Times was less exposed to the US market and does not rely as heavily on dot.com advertising. \"Advertising revenues were up 34% last year - and rose 8% in the first two months of this year - so the picture is different for us,\" he said. But the Dow Jones announcement has underlined analysts' concerns about the health of the whole European advertising market, which relies heavily on contributions from US companies. \"US companies control 60% of global advertising spend and, if the US economy is hit by recession, they will pull back from European markets,\" said Neil Carter, media analyst at ABN Amro. Mr Carter added a hoped-for recovery in the advertising market in the second half of this year is also in doubt. \"Maybe we are at the bottom of the curve but right now there is a significant risk the second-half recovery will not materialise,\" he said. Attention will now turn to Lord Hollick's United Business Media. The publisher makes more than 80% of its profits from the US market.",

      "bodyText": "China will speed up a \"mega-project\" to divert billions of cubic metres of water from the Yangtze to the Yellow River, despite serious concern about the environmental consequences, officials said in Beijing yesterday. One of the three routes through which the water is to be diverted requires the evacuation of 220,000 people, while the water on a second route will be badly polluted, the officials admitted. But they insisted that the \"complexities\" of the project could be handled and that no time should be wasted. \"It is a strategic project to optimise water resources, designed to direct surplus water to the north,\" said Chen Bangzhu, head of a committee discussing the project at this week's meeting of the national people's congress - China's annual parliament. Since central China has more water than it needs, it is thought that diverting some will alleviate the rapidly worsening shortages in the north. Water shortage is a particularly sensitive issue in Beijing, where the water table is falling rapidly while demand grows as living standard improve. An increasing number of sandstorms sweeping into the capital from Mongolia is a vivid and constant reminder of how large areas to the north have been reduced to desert. Environmentalists have warned that large-scale tampering with water systems may have untold adverse effects, and that much more effort should be made to save water first. A study of Chinese water policy by an Australian scholar, Gavan McCormack, warns that \"the ecological implications ... are completely unforeseeable\". The project, written into the new five-year plan, will be \"as huge as the Three Gorges Dam project\", one committee member said. It will cost at least \u00a311.6bn over the next 10 to 15 years. Its \"central route\" will carry water from the Danjiangkou reservoir north along a 780-mile channel. Raising the level of the reservoir and building the channel will force the \"relocation\" of 220,000 people. \"The relocation issue is always difficult, because it involves a huge population, large areas and some political sensitivity,\" Tan Qinglian, a former minister of construction, said yesterday. The \"eastern route\" will siphon water from the lower reaches of the Yangtze, starting at Yangzhou, in Jiangsu province, and following the northern route of the old imperial Grand Canal. The main line of this route will be about 720 miles long. Yuan Guolin, a committee member, said the problem with this route was unsatisfactory water quality. Intensive efforts to deal with the pollution would be needed. The project has been given added impetus by the prime minister, Zhu Rongji, who instructed officials in October to work for an \"early start\". With such a high-level sponsor, doubts about the wisdom of the project are less likely to get a hearing. Mr Zhu told the people's congress on Monday that a lack of water resources was a \"serious limitation\" on development, and said that the plan should be speeded up.

Despite the slump in the US economy, Cordiant reported a weakness in the UK market as it reorganised its Bates Worldwide advertising network. The group surprised analysts by reporting that trading in north America \"remains strong\", due to its decision to concentrate on marketing services. Marketing now provides 60% of Cordiant's revenues and has been a key factor in protecting it from cutbacks in companies' advertising spending. The company decided last year to move away from advertising and concentrate on marketing services. Cordiant's shares rose 5% to 301p in early trading.

      "body": "<p>Vojislav Kostunica, the man who replaced Slobodan Milosevic as Yugoslav president after last autumn's \"people's power\" revolution, is proving to be a bit of a disappointment to many in the west.</p> <p>In a speech this week in Banja Luka, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kostunica said that US and European leaders should stop fretting about Milosevic's extradition to the Hague war crimes tribunal and focus instead on ethnic Albanian violence in and around Kosovo.</p> <p>Unlike Milosevic, Kostunica is a genuine democrat. When he came to power, that seemed more important to outsiders than his avowedly nationalist outlook.</p> <p>Serbia's desperate need of western economic assistance after years of sanctions and Nato's devastating 1999 bombing campaign also suggested that Kostunica would be a compliant partner in restoring regional stability.</p> <p>Instead, Kostunica has doggedly adhered to his strongly held view that the Serbs were the principal victims of the Balkan wars of the past 12 years.</p> <p>He has repeatedly criticised Nato peacekeepers for their actions in UN-administered Kosovo (which remains sovereign Yugoslav territory) and for failing, in his view, to combat Albanian \"terrorism\" in Serbia's Presevo valley and the adjoining border with Macedonia.</p> <p>And despite the increasingly furious protestations of Carla Del Ponte, the war crimes tribunal's chief prosecutor, Kostunica continues to argue against the extradition of Milosevic.</p> <p>Ms Del Ponte described Kostunica as an \"unreconstructed nationalist' this week and said she had found him \"hostile\" during a recent meeting in Belgrade. She threatened to seek punitive measures through the UN if Yugoslavia persisted in obstructing her work.</p> <p>Some leading Serb politicians believe Milosevic must be surrendered to the Hague. An opinion poll published last week suggested most Serbs agree. But others say he should be tried at home on charges ranging from attempted murder to fraud, that convincing evidence will take time to collect and that extradition requires a new act of parliament.</p> <p>Ms Del Ponte gives such arguments short shrift. Her tribunal has no shortage of evidence against Milosevic relating to war crimes and crimes against humanity, she says. So just hand him over.</p> <p>The US takes a similar view. It has set the end of this month as a deadline for at least the commencement of cooperation with the Hague. If the deadline is missed, it threatens to withhold $100m (\u00a370m) in aid.</p> <p>There was speculation meanwhile about a possible compromise under which Milosevic would be surrendered to the tribunal but allowed to stand trial in a special session on Serbian soil.</p> <p>Kostunica's comments in Banja Luka that the west, distracted by the Milosevic case, was failing in its principal task of bringing \"prosperity and peace\" to Kosovo, will further alienate the Nato allies. There is also more than a touch of hypocrisy here.</p> <p>Given Serbia's deplorable record with respect to Kosovo's Albanians, and in dealing with Muslim populations in general, Kostunica's sudden concern for Kosovan welfare looks unconvincing to say the least.</p> <p>Despite serious security problems on Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and Serbia and continuing ethnic Albanian violence within the province, the presence of the 42,000 peacekeepers has enabled the UN administration to make considerable progress. The west also continues to provide large amounts in aid, bilaterally and more broadly through the EU's Balkan Stability Pact.</p> <p>The US coordinator for assistance to eastern Europe, Larry Napper, told a Kosovo donors' meeting in Pristina last month that Washington had pledged more than $700m in 1999 and that up to $94.3m was available in 2001, depending on what other donors provided. He noted that more than 3,000 police officers have now been trained by the UN.</p> <p>Napper said the US assessment was that \"the economic and political situation in Kosovo has greatly improved since we last met in November, 1999\" - a statement even Kostunica would be hard-pressed to rebut.</p> <p>Speaking at a Balkan summit convened in Skopje, Macedonia, last month, Chris Patten, the EU's external affairs commissioner, also said progress had been made. And he directly addressed Kostunica's concerns.</p> <p>\"We have strongly condemned the violent and illegal terrorist actions by ethnically motivated extremist armed groups in south Serbia which could destabilise the region,\" Patten said, in a clear reference to ethnic Albanian insurgents in Presevo. \"It is time for every Kosovar to make a stand against violence and outlaw its perpetrators.\"</p> <p>Since Napper and Patten spoke, Nato has stepped up border patrols, extended cross-border surveillance, moved up reinforcements and agreed to hand over control of parts of the Presevo buffer zone to Kostunica's forces.</p> <p>The Nato operation, known as K-For, is still open to criticism - particularly when it comes to the reluctance of US commanders to take risks. But Kostunica's claims that the west is ignoring the security situation and Kosovo's prosperity and merely obsessing instead about Milosevic clearly do not hold water.</p> <p>Clues to Kostunica's behaviour must be sought elsewhere. For a start, as Yugoslav president, his domestic powers are very limited. After last December's opposition victory in Serbia's parliamentary elections, he risks being eclipsed. So he needs to make his presence felt.</p> <p>Second, he wants to hold together what remains of his country. Montenegro's moves towards independence, which may take a leap forward after this April's elections, are an affront to his nationalist credo.</p> <p>Independence threatens further to erode his power-base - and Yugoslavia's very existence.

      "bodyText": "Vojislav Kostunica, the man who replaced Slobodan Milosevic as Yugoslav president after last autumn's \"people's power\" revolution, is proving to be a bit of a disappointment to many in the west. In a speech this week in Banja Luka, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kostunica said that US and European leaders should stop fretting about Milosevic's extradition to the Hague war crimes tribunal and focus instead on ethnic Albanian violence in and around Kosovo. Unlike Milosevic, Kostunica is a genuine democrat. When he came to power, that seemed more important to outsiders than his avowedly nationalist outlook. Serbia's desperate need of western economic assistance after years of sanctions and Nato's devastating 1999 bombing campaign also suggested that Kostunica would be a compliant partner in restoring regional stability. Instead, Kostunica has doggedly adhered to his strongly held view that the Serbs were the principal victims of the Balkan wars of the past 12 years. He has repeatedly criticised Nato peacekeepers for their actions in UN-administered Kosovo (which remains sovereign Yugoslav territory) and for failing, in his view, to combat Albanian \"terrorism\" in Serbia's Presevo valley and the adjoining border with Macedonia. And despite the increasingly furious protestations of Carla Del Ponte, the war crimes tribunal's chief prosecutor, Kostunica continues to argue against the extradition of Milosevic. Ms Del Ponte described Kostunica as an \"unreconstructed nationalist' this week and said she had found him \"hostile\" during a recent meeting in Belgrade. She threatened to seek punitive measures through the UN if Yugoslavia persisted in obstructing her work. Some leading Serb politicians believe Milosevic must be surrendered to the Hague. An opinion poll published last week suggested most Serbs agree. But others say he should be tried at home on charges ranging from attempted murder to fraud, that convincing evidence will take time to collect and that extradition requires a new act of parliament. Ms Del Ponte gives such arguments short shrift. Her tribunal has no shortage of evidence against Milosevic relating to war crimes and crimes against humanity, she says. So just hand him over. The US takes a similar view. It has set the end of this month as a deadline for at least the commencement of cooperation with the Hague. If the deadline is missed, it threatens to withhold $100m (\u00a370m) in aid. There was speculation meanwhile about a possible compromise under which Milosevic would be surrendered to the tribunal but allowed to stand trial in a special session on Serbian soil. Kostunica's comments in Banja Luka that the west, distracted by the Milosevic case, was failing in its principal task of bringing \"prosperity and peace\" to Kosovo, will further alienate the Nato allies. There is also more than a touch of hypocrisy here. Given Serbia's deplorable record with respect to Kosovo's Albanians, and in dealing with Muslim populations in general, Kostunica's sudden concern for Kosovan welfare looks unconvincing to say the least. Despite serious security problems on Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and Serbia and continuing ethnic Albanian violence within the province, the presence of the 42,000 peacekeepers has enabled the UN administration to make considerable progress. The west also continues to provide large amounts in aid, bilaterally and more broadly through the EU's Balkan Stability Pact. The US coordinator for assistance to eastern Europe, Larry Napper, told a Kosovo donors' meeting in Pristina last month that Washington had pledged more than $700m in 1999 and that up to $94.3m was available in 2001, depending on what other donors provided. He noted that more than 3,000 police officers have now been trained by the UN. Napper said the US assessment was that \"the economic and political situation in Kosovo has greatly improved since we last met in November, 1999\" - a statement even Kostunica would be hard-pressed to rebut. Speaking at a Balkan summit convened in Skopje, Macedonia, last month, Chris Patten, the EU's external affairs commissioner, also said progress had been made. And he directly addressed Kostunica's concerns. \"We have strongly condemned the violent and illegal terrorist actions by ethnically motivated extremist armed groups in south Serbia which could destabilise the region,\" Patten said, in a clear reference to ethnic Albanian insurgents in Presevo. \"It is time for every Kosovar to make a stand against violence and outlaw its perpetrators.\" Since Napper and Patten spoke, Nato has stepped up border patrols, extended cross-border surveillance, moved up reinforcements and agreed to hand over control of parts of the Presevo buffer zone to Kostunica's forces. The Nato operation, known as K-For, is still open to criticism - particularly when it comes to the reluctance of US commanders to take risks. But Kostunica's claims that the west is ignoring the security situation and Kosovo's prosperity and merely obsessing instead about Milosevic clearly do not hold water. Clues to Kostunica's behaviour must be sought elsewhere. For a start, as Yugoslav president, his domestic powers are very limited. After last December's opposition victory in Serbia's parliamentary elections, he risks being eclipsed. So he needs to make his presence felt. Second, he wants to hold together what remains of his country. Montenegro's moves towards independence, which may take a leap forward after this April's elections, are an affront to his nationalist credo. Independence threatens further to erode his power-base - and Yugoslavia's very existence. But he knows that the west, too, is nervous about a Montenegrin secession. The same goes for the prospect of an independent Kosovo. Third, Kostunica knows that in his tussles with the west, he can count on Russia's support. Vladimir Putin has taken over from Boris Yeltsin as a champion of Orthodox Slavs. He weighed in this week, saying Nato's peacekeeping problems proved the west should never have intervened in Kosovo in the first place. Kostunica also knows that Belgrade's support is critical if the 1995 Dayton power-sharing agreement in Bosnia, presently under threat from breakaway Croat hardliners, is to continue to work. The reason he was in Banja Luka this week was to sign an agreement signalling closer ties with the Bosnian Serbs. Kostunica may be calculating that ultimately, Nato and the west will need a viable, friendly Yugoslavia more than they need the truculent, unbiddable Albanians they intervened in Kosovo to protect. Historically speaking, this has usually been the case. And it may be so again, notwithstanding the war of 1999. In this bigger drama, the ultimate fate of Milosevic plays but a small part.

      "bodyText": "Black music and lifestyle glossy Touch has closed after failing to secure a buyer. Touch editor Vince Jackson confirmed staff had been told on Monday that the magazine would go into voluntary liquidation. Touch, which was originally called Free!, was launched in the late 80s.. It developed a strong core readership and became the magazine of record for black music in the UK. An insider said Touch's closure was \"indicative of a lack of belief in black magazines across the board\". \"You see advertisers buying into the images of black culture but when it comes to supporting the magazines with advertising, they can't put their money where their mouths are,\" he said. The source said the popularity of black music in the charts had failed to register with advertisers. He said that potential buyers got cold feet when it came to taking on a magazine aimed at black readers. \"If this were Dazed &amp; Confused, someone would have come in and rescued it,\" he added. The magazine was believed to be selling around 35,000 copies a month, but the lack of advertising led to mounting debts. Seven staff have been laid off. It is understood Touch's publisher Joe Pidgeon had conversations with several publishing houses in a bid to sell the magazine but Mr Jackson would not confirm the names of potential buyers. Music magazines across the board have been squeezed recently as they have been hit by the fragmenting advertising market. However, more mainstream clubbing and dance-music titles such as Mixmag, which was bought several years ago by Emap, have performed well.

More than two-fifths of those with one child said they had incomes below \u00a3163 a week, the amount needed to buy the goods and services that most people regarded as basic essentials. </p> <p>More than half lone parents with two or more children had incomes below their absolute poverty level at \u00a3227 a week. And 25% of single pensioners fell below the \u00a3106-a-week threshold needed to surmount absolute poverty. In each case benefit levels were about 20% below the income needed to keep people out of absolute poverty if they had to remain on state support for more than about six months, the authors of the study estimated. </p> <p>The Breadline Europe study, led by academics from Bristol University and the London School of Economics, was based on a social exclusion survey in September 1999, six months after the government began its anti-poverty drive. </p> <p>Ministers had dismissed previous research showing that numbers in poverty grew over the first two years of the Labour government. They said the position would improve after introduction of the minimum wage and working families tax credit - bringing 1.2m children and 800,000 adults out of poverty by April 2002 and abolishing child poverty completely by 2020. </p> <p>But time lags in the official data will force the government to go into the next election without hard evidence to demonstrate progress. </p> <p>The key official poverty indicator, dating from a survey in 1998, will show there were 14m adults in households with less than half average income. This was nearly 1m more than in the early 1990s, and more than double the number in the early 1980s. </p> <p>The Breadline Europe survey was based on more recent data and measured poverty against a different yardstick, based on the public's assessment of what are the absolute essentials of life. Households lacking at least six of these essentials because they could not afford them were categorised as a lot below the level of income needed to avoid absolute poverty. </p> <p>David Gordon, senior research fellow at Bristol university and co-author of the report, said people's experiences differed from Treasury models of how they ought to behave. </p> <p>\"Absolute poverty is not supposed to exist in a country like Britain. But 9% of the population have reported their income was a lot below that needed each week to keep their household out of absolute poverty and a further 8% said their income was a little below.\" </p> <p>Peter Townsend, professor of international social policy at the LSE and co-author, said the growth of poverty in Britain countered the trend in other western European countries. </p> <p>\"Some observers believe that, under successive governments, the country has been going so far down the road of residualising welfare that it has become detached from most of the other European states and is lamely following in the wake of the US,\" he said. </p> <p>The study showed dramatic increases in extreme forms of poverty across eastern Europe over the past 10 years, but the figures could not be compared directly with the UK. </p> <p>Simon Clarke, professor of sociology at Warwick university, said over 60% of Russians were living in poverty in 1998. \"Over a quarter were in extreme poverty, with incomes of less than half that required to acquire basic means of subsistence. This compares to a rate of about 11% at the beginning of reform in 1992,\" he said.</p>",

The study showed dramatic increases in extreme forms of poverty across eastern Europe over the past 10 years, but the figures could not be compared directly with the UK. Simon Clarke, professor of sociology at Warwick university, said over 60% of Russians were living in poverty in 1998. \"Over a quarter were in extreme poverty, with incomes of less than half that required to acquire basic means of subsistence. This compares to a rate of about 11% at the beginning of reform in 1992,\" he said.",

The quirkily named Queally follows in the footsteps of one of the country's favourite sporting sons, Steve Cram, whose golden-haired image adorned packets of Start in the 1980s. Packets of both brands will feature pictures of Queally, who won gold and silver medals at last year's Sydney Olympics. The company is aiming to position the two brands as healthy breakfast cereal ideal for sportsmen and women. An on-pack promotion kicks off the relaunch in June, offering the chance to win one of five training bikes used by Jason in the run-up to the Olympics. \"We are thrilled to have joined forces with Jason and hope his sporting achievements and the goodness of Sustain and Start will inspire cereal fans to make the most of their sporting ability,\" said Peter Smith, UK brand manager of Kellogg's.

A similar increase is proposed in the disabled person's tax credit (DPTC).

These go up from \u00a3100 to \u00a3135 for families with childcare costs for one child and from \u00a3150 to \u00a3200 for families with two or more children. </p> <p>Because this credit covers up to 70% of eligible childcare costs, the changes mean a maximum of \u00a394.50 per week for one child and \u00a3140 for two children towards registered childcare costs. </p> <p>As predicted, the new children's tax credit (CTC) will be worth up to \u00a310 a week when it comes into effect in April. This is \u00a31.50 a week more than the starting rate announced in last year's Budget and represents a tax cut for about 5m families with children under 16. The CTC replaces the married couple's allowance but is available to unmarried couples and single parents. </p> <p>To increase support for families with very young children - \"the time when family income tends to fall as family costs rise\", as the chancellor put it - from April 2002 the CTC will be increased by a further \u00a310 a week for families in the year of a child's birth. </p> <p>The Treasury has confirmed that this \"baby bonus\", which will be worth up to \u00a31,040 for about 500,000 families each year, will be paid at this higher rate for the entire tax year (from one April to the next) in which a baby is born. If, for example, a family claims the bonus payment for a baby born in September, it will receive a lump sum backdated to the previous April and the rest through their pay packets on a monthly basis until the following April. </p> <p>Families on income-related benefits who will not benefit from the increases in WFTC or the CTC, will get an increase of \u00a31.50 a week in the child allowances in income support and jobseeker's allowance from October 2001, to match the rise in the CTC in this Budget. </p> <p>As announced in last year's Budget, child benefit goes up in line with indexation from April to \u00a315.50 for the first child and \u00a310.35 for subsequent children. </p> <p>Martin Barnes, director of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: \"This is a good Budget for families and children.

Paul Myers is making his audacious move just as well-publicised rival Napster faces closure. The courts ruled that Napster's service - which offered free copies of millions of tracks from artists ranging from Madonna to the Beatles - was \"bootlegging\". Mr Myers is the founder of X-Stream, the UK's first free internet service provider. He has just signed a key technology deal that will allow music lovers to download their favourite tracks legally. He claims he has already received an enthusiastic response from record companies. Mr Myers's deal with technology company Cantametrix means royalty payments to record companies and artists can be carried out automatically - something Napster could not do. Mr Myers has yet to get the record companies to commit to his Napster-like service, to be called Wippit. However, he said he was involved in early negotiations with all the players and expected to be able to announce \"a bunch of independents\" within weeks. He expects Wippit, which is being tested by users, to be ready to launch by the end of May. Mr Myers, who is widely respected, is confident of the venture's success. \"Resistance is futile - the record companies realise the market is changing rapidly,\" he said. \"Every day, billions of downloads are going on and denying this is like locking the park gates to keep the crows in.\" The new technology means Wippit users will have access to whole, easily identifiable tracks and every download is logged and paid for. \"Not only can we identify correctly each recording, we have a viable system to ensure a payment is made,\" said Mr Myers.

      "body": "<p>Ruskin Kerslake, aged 26, has just been propelled by accident into the vanguard of Britain's information revolution. He is probably the first person in the country to have their apartment wired with ultra-fast fibre optic cable - the Holy Grail of the \"broadband\" digital age. This is because he happens to live in a large block of flats in central London which NTL, the cable company, is fitting with fibre as a showcase for what the future could look like. Kerslake happened to be the first to be connected. This enables his computer, a laptop, to send and receive data at nearly 40 times the speed of a standard 56k modem and with the potential to go ten or fifteen times faster than that. </p> <p>He describes the experience as \"brilliant\" and claims it has changed the way he does business. Now he is hooked. If he moves home, he says, it will have to be to another with a fibre link. </p> <p>A fast link is tailor-made for the job he does. He is a sales engineer for an international company selling CRM (customer relationship management) software packages. When he used to send demonstration packages using up 10MB (megabytes) online to customers it used to take hours which would stop him doing anything else, even sending email, during that period. Now he can send large amounts of data quickly and carry on emailing. </p> <p>Recently he was providing support for an order the company was chasing in Eastern Europe. Normally he would have had to send his passport to be approved and then fly there - taking up four or five days. But with the fast link he was able to demonstrate the product online. This saved his company all that time enabling him to do other things. The only limiting factor, he said, was the poor quality of the phone line at the other end. The company won a similar contract in Sweden without him having to leave his small apartment in Dolphin Square. </p> <p>Most of the time he is now travelling or working from home. He only goes into the office once or twice a week. He says: \"Since being wired up, the time I have spent at home has increased. I can be up and working at 8am instead of being on a train. I haven't lost any productivity recently through train delays. It is the biggest benefit in my working life - but it also underlines the importance of going into the office and seeing colleagues.\" </p> <p>He can also set up an international conferencing facility enabling him to talk to or message groups of colleagues and clients around the world simultaneously thereby avoiding the need - and the cost - of all of them flying to a mutually convenient airport hotel. Each of the participants has a colour code on screen to confirm that they are still there. This avoids a situation in which one of them carries on talking for an hour not realising there is no one at the other end. </p> <p>He adds: \"The only real problem is remembering to turn it off. Otherwise working for a global company becomes a 24 hour a day job. It is so easy to leave it on and rush over to it whenever the email pings.\" </p> <p>There are compensations. The high-speed connection enables him to download music from Napster, the US file-swapping service, almost instantaneously instead of having to wait ages. This enables him to have music while he works. And judging by the pressures of the online work load, it sounds as though he needs it. </p> <p>Despite Kerslake's enthusiasm, broadband connectivity isn't exactly the new rock 'n' roll. A recent survey for NTL found that 70% of the population had not even heard of the word and 30% of those who had heard of it thought it referred to radio. Yet the quest to deliver broadband - capable of high speed video transmission - to every home has been the ultimate objective of the information revolution. </p> <p>It has been a long time coming. In 1986, the government set up the Macdonald committee to decide how it should be done. Two years later - surprise, surprise in the Thatcher era - it concluded that the future of communications in the UK should be left to market forces not Grand Design. </p> <p>It ruled out the alternative of allowing BT to spend up to \u00a320 billion to build a national fibre optic grid - the Rolls-Royce version of broadband - in exchange for being allowed to deliver entertainment (meaning video on demand). The main reason for not considering this proposition was that it would have enhanced the monopoly position of BT at a time when the government was trying to encourage competition from the fledgling cable companies. Cynics wondered whether the Thatcher government would have turned down a national grid for electricity as not being practical politics. </p> <p>About the same time, Ian Mackintosh wrote an influential book (Sunrise Europe) advocating a transnational broadband grid for the whole of Europe: this was intended to kick start the digital revolution and give Europe a platform from which to exploit the fruits of the revolution around the world. </p> <p>Remember, in those days the world wide web wasn't even remotely on anyone's horizon. All the talk was about building what Al Gore dubbed (or at least popularised) the \"information highway\" or high speed links between computers. </p> <p>Now, 15 years later, broadband in its various guises (cable modems, ADSL and fibre optics) is only just being rolled out on a national scale. It is only within the past few weeks that fibre optic links all the way to the home have been installed in the UK in a real-world situation. And that is just in one - admittedly large - block of flats.</p> <p>Even when installed, broadband won't wield its true magic until most of the population has it. It is the old story. One mobile phone (or fax machine) is useless. But the more people sign up the greater the network effects. Once every citizen has the capacity to video phone each other then it could truly revolutionise entertainment, education and business. </p> <p>The \"killer application\" for the new technology may well be a service that doesn't even exist at the moment. Who ever thought that the capacity to send text messages from a mobile (put in as an afterthought) would become the fastest growing service in recent memory? </p> <p>At the moment we are in a chicken and egg situation. Software companies aren't writing applications for true broadband because not enough people are on it. At the same time consumers aren't buying in sufficient numbers to bring the price down because they can't see the applications. </p> <p>Today, Online offers a taste of what is to come by sampling three different ways of experiencing broadband. It will all look different in another 15 years. </p> <p><strong> High speed internet access for consumers </strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Now </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Dial-up modems</strong> Speed: 56k.

Finally, BT told me I couldn't have it because I live too far away from an exchange. Apparently my neighbourhood in north-west Surrey is destined to be left behind on the internet superhighway. </p> <p>Frustrated, I telephoned my cable company, NTL, and was astonished to hear they not only had a broadband internet product for home users, but said they could install it in a week. I was even more flabbergasted when they did. A man in a van turned up - on time - and in less than an hour, I was up and running. </p> <p>The service is permanently on line. It costs \u00a324.99 a month, including modem rental, and there are no call charges. The modem acts like a long piece of wire connecting my Macintosh to the internet via an Ethernet port. The setup was seamless. I just flipped my Mac's TCP/IP connection from PPP to Ethernet via DHCP Server and it worked first time. </p> <p>My reason for wanting broadband - apart from my nature as an early adopter of everything - was speed. I often work from home and send huge PowerPoint and Word documents back and forth via email, as well as downloading documents from the web. </p> <p>True, I appreciate the extra bandwidth. Now, when I need a home file for the office, there's no messing around with Zip disks. I simply connect to my home machine from work and get the file I want. But speed itself has turned out to be less life-changing than the fast - or rather, instant - connection time and the low cost. </p> <p>Now that my home computer is permanently connected to the internet, it has become an extension of my computer. It's like having a large hard disk available at all times. I've stopped downloading documents to store on my system, and started saving just the links. When I need a software upgrade, a game patch, or a new device driver, I start downloading and get on with something else. </p> <p>Since I'm no longer waiting for connection, I use my PC to find out things that used to involve phone calls or flipping through the newspaper, such as what's on TV, whether I've paid my Visa bill, and what kind of washing machines are on sale at Currys. </p> <p>But I have made a sobering discovery. Instant access cannot make up for old-fashioned human error. I have not been able to check my online banking account because I seem to have forgotten my password. I will have to make a phone call to straighten that out. Oh, well. </p> <p>Here are a couple of recent \"always on\" behaviour modifications that strike me as interesting. I have started listening to Radio 5 on the internet. I still listen to Radio 4 on the radio, since it is FM stereo and the reception is good. But Radio 5 is medium wave and poor quality, so it comes through clearer on the internet. I'm still annoyed that I can't listen to football on Saturday afternoon this way. Another audio example is Napster: more than once during the week I have used it to download tracks that I own because I am too lazy to search for them in another room. </p> <p>The early experiences gained from the transition to broadband suggest some thing about the impending transition from 9.6kbps GSM circuit-switched data (eg, current Wap services) to the world of next generation high-speed mobile phone services. I predict it won't be the bandwidth that is the driver (hence my scepticism about video as the major revenue stream for mobile operators), but the fact that connection is instant and has low marginal cost. With a permanent connection, for example, why store phone numbers in your phone? If your phone is permanently connected, you might as well leave the phone numbers on your PC at home: the phone can get them whenever it needs them.

I have 100 acres and high fuel costs, with four tractors and oil heating in some barns. Two pence off is a start, but it is not a lot. We have the highest fuel tax in Europe.\"</p> <p>Mr Hough might save thousands from yesterday's cuts but he said the reductions on fuel were not enough to enable British pig farming to match mainland Europe and the rest of the world. British pig production has dropped 20% in recent years, while continental production has grown.</p> <p>\"Gordon Brown must know that we are heading towards importing all meat if the industry continues to struggle without subsidies.

      "bodyText": "From the disinfectant-sodden straw fortress around his pig farm near Kirkham, Lancashire, John Hough welcomed yesterday's announcement on tractor tax but was more concerned about three words missing from Gordon Brown's Budget speech: \"foot and mouth\". \"The abolition of tractor tax and the small cuts in fuel tax were good things for the countryside where competition is high,\" he said. \"But tractor tax was comparatively low anyway. I have 100 acres and high fuel costs, with four tractors and oil heating in some barns. Two pence off is a start, but it is not a lot. We have the highest fuel tax in Europe.\" Mr Hough might save thousands from yesterday's cuts but he said the reductions on fuel were not enough to enable British pig farming to match mainland Europe and the rest of the world. British pig production has dropped 20% in recent years, while continental production has grown. \"Gordon Brown must know that we are heading towards importing all meat if the industry continues to struggle without subsidies. That must be what the government wants. They can't be so shortsighted as to not see what's happening.\" Mr Brown promised \u00a3150m of rapidly delivered agricultural compensation for farming and industries which \"today face long standing difficulties\".

      "body": "<p>Clouds may be threatening the global economy but the chancellor remained upbeat yesterday about the prospects for Britain. </p> <p>Boasting that Labour's management of the economy had delivered the lowest mortgage rates, unemployment and inflation for a generation, he predicted that UK growth would be largely unaffected by a slowdown in the US. </p> <p>\"With the United States today experiencing a necessary slowing and Japan barely growing, the growth rate in the world's major economies this year is expected to halve while the world still faces volatile oil prices,\" Mr Brown said. </p> <p>\"But, because Britain's economy remains stable, our Treasury forecast is that this year Britain's growth will be within a sustainable range of 2.25%-2.75%.\" </p> <p>Most City analysts have downgraded their expectations for growth since the turn of the year in response to the bad news from America. Mr Brown was confident enough yesterday to repeat his prediction for growth from November. </p> <p>Although the Treasury estimates that a slowdown in US growth of one percentage point would cut UK growth by a quarter point, the chill winds blowing across the Atlantic will be offset by stronger demand at home. Consumer spending is forecast to grow by one percentage point more than the Treasury expected last November. </p> <p>Yesterday's tax cuts and public spending increases would inject extra demand into the economy and help insulate it from any storms in the global outlook, analysts said. </p> <p>While yesterday's forecast is in line with the long-term performance of the economy, it represents a slowdown from last year when it grew by 3%, driven by household spending. </p> <p>The Treasury expects households to tighten their belts slightly this year because of the uncertain global economic outlook. Household spending will rise by 3.25%-3.5% this year on top of 3.75% last year. </p> <p>Treasury economists have been expecting consumer spending to slow and there are few signs yet of them retrenching. \"Greater job security and low inflation may have reduced longer-term precautionary motives for savings,\" the Treasury notes. </p> <p>The global slowdown will hit industry, even though the economy as a whole will remain on course. Last November, Mr Brown forecast that the manufacturing sector would grow by 2-2.25% this year.

      "bodyText": "Clouds may be threatening the global economy but the chancellor remained upbeat yesterday about the prospects for Britain. Boasting that Labour's management of the economy had delivered the lowest mortgage rates, unemployment and inflation for a generation, he predicted that UK growth would be largely unaffected by a slowdown in the US. \"With the United States today experiencing a necessary slowing and Japan barely growing, the growth rate in the world's major economies this year is expected to halve while the world still faces volatile oil prices,\" Mr Brown said. \"But, because Britain's economy remains stable, our Treasury forecast is that this year Britain's growth will be within a sustainable range of 2.25%-2.75%.\" Most City analysts have downgraded their expectations for growth since the turn of the year in response to the bad news from America. Mr Brown was confident enough yesterday to repeat his prediction for growth from November. Although the Treasury estimates that a slowdown in US growth of one percentage point would cut UK growth by a quarter point, the chill winds blowing across the Atlantic will be offset by stronger demand at home. Consumer spending is forecast to grow by one percentage point more than the Treasury expected last November. Yesterday's tax cuts and public spending increases would inject extra demand into the economy and help insulate it from any storms in the global outlook, analysts said. While yesterday's forecast is in line with the long-term performance of the economy, it represents a slowdown from last year when it grew by 3%, driven by household spending. The Treasury expects households to tighten their belts slightly this year because of the uncertain global economic outlook. Household spending will rise by 3.25%-3.5% this year on top of 3.75% last year. Treasury economists have been expecting consumer spending to slow and there are few signs yet of them retrenching. \"Greater job security and low inflation may have reduced longer-term precautionary motives for savings,\" the Treasury notes. The global slowdown will hit industry, even though the economy as a whole will remain on course. Last November, Mr Brown forecast that the manufacturing sector would grow by 2-2.25% this year. Yesterday he downgraded that forecast to 1.75%-2%. Lower world growth is expected to cut demand for British exports. Last November, Mr Brown was expecting exports and imports to rise by more than 7% this year; now he expecting export growth of just 5%. Because imports will continue rising at the same pace, the trade deficit will widen more than expected last November, with the current account ballooning to a record \u00a325bn next year.

This year, steady 2.5% growth and low inflation is expected. Low inflation and low interest rates are global phenomena. A huge current account deficit - \u00a321.8bn - was forecast.

      "byline": "Andrew Emerson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Claude Shannon, who has died aged 84, perhaps more than anyone else laid the groundwork for today's digital revolution. His single-handed exposition of information theory, stating that all information could be represented mathematically as a succession of noughts and ones, facilitated the digital manipulation of data without which today's information society would be unthinkable. </p> <p> More correctly, his theory applied not only to data but also to communication of all kinds and, combined with the pulse code modulation system of digital telecommunications transmission devised in 1937 by Englishman Alec Reeves, effectively laid the foundations for today's modern digital communications and broadcasting networks, the internet and much more. </p> <p> Claude Shannon's childhood was spent in Gaylord, a small town in Michigan where he had a normal state school education. Inspired by his hero, Thomas Edison (whom he later learned was a distant cousin), the young Shannon showed an early gift for science and mathematics as well as a talent for constructing models and gadgets, including a private telegraph system to a friend's house half a mile away. These interests served him well at the University of Michigan, where he graduated in 1936 with twin BSc degrees in electrical engineering and mathematics. </p> <p> Shannon's master's thesis, obtained in 1940 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reflected work he had done at MIT and Bell Telephone Laboratories to solve the growing complexity of telephone systems. Entitled A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits, it demonstrated that problem solving could be achieved by manipulating just two sym bols - 1 and 0 - in a process that could be carried out automatically with electrical circuitry. A switch turned on could represent the symbol 1; 0 would be a switch that was turned off. That dissertation has since been hailed as one of the most significant master's theses of the 20th century. To all intents and purposes, its use of binary code and Boolean algebra paved the way for the digital circuitry that is crucial to the operation of modern computers and telecommunications equipment. </p> <p> Eight years later, Shannon published another landmark paper, A Mathematical Theory of Communication, generally taken as his most important scientific contribution. This paper put information theory on the map, establishing terminology and a framework that are still used today. He coined the term bit for a binary digit, and explained that the maximum effectiveness of communications channels would be achieved only when the source rate of the information carried matched the capacity of that channel, both being measured in bits per second. This \"mathematical theory\" relied heavily on statistical analysis, and in the process Shannon also developed a measure of the efficiency of a communications system, which he called its entropy. At the same time, he separated as different tasks the technical problem of delivering a message from the process of understanding what that message means, allowing engineers to focus on the message delivery system. Given that most communications channels are subject also to interference, Shannon established how best a message could be delivered in sub-ideal circumstances. Overlying all this was the knowledge that the nature of the information transmitted was irrelevant. Whatever its nature - speech, text or images - it could be represented numerically in binary form. </p> <p> To engineers accustomed to continuous waveforms, this revolutionary and divisive technique of splitting them into discrete units of ones and zeros was both alien and abstract, but it found favour. Indeed, the very fact that this model of communications systems was so entirely abstract was no disadvantage; on the contrary, this gave it application to a broad range of communication functions, both analogue and digital. It was adopted enthusiastically by communications engineers and prompted attempts to apply similar techniques in other branches of the sciences. </p> <p> Shannon applied the same radical approach to cryptography research, in which he later became a consultant to the US government. In his paper Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems, he argued that messages could survive any degree of interference - or scrambling - if sufficient \"redundancy\" (extra bits) were added. Over successive decades, this technique has developed into sophisticated error-correction codes that ensure the integrity of data prone to unwanted corruption in transmission. </p> <p> Many of Shannon's pioneering insights were developed before they could be applied in practical form. Along with Alec Reeves's concept of telephone conversations transmitted as pulses and Alan Turing's dream of all-purpose computing devices, Shannon's ideas had to wait for solid-state electronics to mature before they could be achieved practically. In fact, it was only the arrival of integrated circuits in the 1970s that made possible the commercial exploitation of technology based on Shannon's theories. </p> <p> His work was not confined to academic research, however, and his eclectic extracurricular interests and activities were notable. They included juggling while riding a unicycle down the halls of Bell Labs, devising a calculator to perform arithmetic operations in Roman numerals and designing a mechanical device for solving Rubik's cube puzzle. He was truly a remarkable man, yet unknown to most of the world. He is survived by his wife, a son and daughter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Claude Shannon, who has died aged 84, perhaps more than anyone else laid the groundwork for today's digital revolution. His single-handed exposition of information theory, stating that all information could be represented mathematically as a succession of noughts and ones, facilitated the digital manipulation of data without which today's information society would be unthinkable. More correctly, his theory applied not only to data but also to communication of all kinds and, combined with the pulse code modulation system of digital telecommunications transmission devised in 1937 by Englishman Alec Reeves, effectively laid the foundations for today's modern digital communications and broadcasting networks, the internet and much more. Claude Shannon's childhood was spent in Gaylord, a small town in Michigan where he had a normal state school education. Inspired by his hero, Thomas Edison (whom he later learned was a distant cousin), the young Shannon showed an early gift for science and mathematics as well as a talent for constructing models and gadgets, including a private telegraph system to a friend's house half a mile away. These interests served him well at the University of Michigan, where he graduated in 1936 with twin BSc degrees in electrical engineering and mathematics. Shannon's master's thesis, obtained in 1940 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reflected work he had done at MIT and Bell Telephone Laboratories to solve the growing complexity of telephone systems. Entitled A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits, it demonstrated that problem solving could be achieved by manipulating just two sym bols - 1 and 0 - in a process that could be carried out automatically with electrical circuitry. A switch turned on could represent the symbol 1; 0 would be a switch that was turned off. That dissertation has since been hailed as one of the most significant master's theses of the 20th century. To all intents and purposes, its use of binary code and Boolean algebra paved the way for the digital circuitry that is crucial to the operation of modern computers and telecommunications equipment. Eight years later, Shannon published another landmark paper, A Mathematical Theory of Communication, generally taken as his most important scientific contribution. This paper put information theory on the map, establishing terminology and a framework that are still used today. He coined the term bit for a binary digit, and explained that the maximum effectiveness of communications channels would be achieved only when the source rate of the information carried matched the capacity of that channel, both being measured in bits per second. This \"mathematical theory\" relied heavily on statistical analysis, and in the process Shannon also developed a measure of the efficiency of a communications system, which he called its entropy. At the same time, he separated as different tasks the technical problem of delivering a message from the process of understanding what that message means, allowing engineers to focus on the message delivery system. Given that most communications channels are subject also to interference, Shannon established how best a message could be delivered in sub-ideal circumstances. Overlying all this was the knowledge that the nature of the information transmitted was irrelevant. Whatever its nature - speech, text or images - it could be represented numerically in binary form. To engineers accustomed to continuous waveforms, this revolutionary and divisive technique of splitting them into discrete units of ones and zeros was both alien and abstract, but it found favour. Indeed, the very fact that this model of communications systems was so entirely abstract was no disadvantage; on the contrary, this gave it application to a broad range of communication functions, both analogue and digital. It was adopted enthusiastically by communications engineers and prompted attempts to apply similar techniques in other branches of the sciences. Shannon applied the same radical approach to cryptography research, in which he later became a consultant to the US government. In his paper Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems, he argued that messages could survive any degree of interference - or scrambling - if sufficient \"redundancy\" (extra bits) were added. Over successive decades, this technique has developed into sophisticated error-correction codes that ensure the integrity of data prone to unwanted corruption in transmission. Many of Shannon's pioneering insights were developed before they could be applied in practical form. Along with Alec Reeves's concept of telephone conversations transmitted as pulses and Alan Turing's dream of all-purpose computing devices, Shannon's ideas had to wait for solid-state electronics to mature before they could be achieved practically. In fact, it was only the arrival of integrated circuits in the 1970s that made possible the commercial exploitation of technology based on Shannon's theories. His work was not confined to academic research, however, and his eclectic extracurricular interests and activities were notable. They included juggling while riding a unicycle down the halls of Bell Labs, devising a calculator to perform arithmetic operations in Roman numerals and designing a mechanical device for solving Rubik's cube puzzle. He was truly a remarkable man, yet unknown to most of the world. He is survived by his wife, a son and daughter.",

Several new masts - including one atop the Isle of Man TT Race grandstand - have been installed, winning praise from locals for being more discreet than their predecessors. Building the network has not been without headaches, some caused by occasional cultural differences between members of the multinational team of engineers. \"A team from our Japanese partners came over with the first base stations on December 19,\" says Briers. \"We discovered that they didn't stop work for Christmas, so a few of our team only had a day off, which caused a few grumbles,\" laughs Briers. He will laugh even harder if, come May, that turned out to be his only headache in this high profile project.",

Eight months - and \u00a330m - down the line Work24 had attracted only some 10,000 registrations, and even of that modest number, fewer had opted to do business on the site. It had aimed for 150,000. </p> <p>Meanwhile Barclays B2B.com, another \u00a330m venture, this time by Barclays Bank and Accenture (n\u00e9e Andersen Consulting) has announced it expects to receive no revenue from the site this year. </p> <p>Giant B2Bs such as the car industry marketplace Covisint are regularly cited as the proof positive of B2B, but question marks still hang over whether SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) are ready to trade online. As optimism wavers, analysts are also pointing out that here in Europe we don't benefit from the size, single language and single currency of the US market. All of a sudden there is talk of a B2B backlash. </p> <p>\"There is a backlash and it is justified,\" says Alex Drobik, the vice president of Gartner Research. \"Whilst it's true we haven't seen the excesses of the B2C market there has been an equal amount of hype about e-marketplaces.

Researchers at Jupiter MMXI predict that online B2B trade will grow to 1.8 trillion euros by 2004. However, they too envisage a drastic commercial cull, predicting that of the 500 or so B2B marketplaces present today, fewer than 100 will be around to share that booty. </p> <p>Jupiter also picks its top 10 of likely winners, ranging from a Belgian fish marketplace (PEFA.com), to a Swedish construction industry portal EU-supply.com.

The support of the big industry players is identified by both Gartner and Jupiter as key to the success of a B2B marketplace. That, however, raises concerns about the possibility of fewer and fewer markets wielding ever more purchasing power - a concern that has seen aerospace industry marketplace Myaircraft.com referred to the EC's competition investigators. </p> <p>Advocates point out that a well-run B2B market can have precisely the opposite effect - simultaneously broadening the range of suppliers that have access to buyers while offering the purchaser a wider choice. One of the main advantages of B2B marketplaces is that they can significantly reduce costs while putting the procurement process through a competitive tendering framework,\" says Pirouz. \"Businesses can have the convenience of using a single supplier catalogue, with the benefits of comparing prices from all the suppliers _ [which means] small suppliers can compete with bigger ones on a level playing field.\" </p> <p>In short you place one order, and have one checkout and billing system, while behind the scenes, suppliers are competing to come up with the best offer. </p> <p>Pirouz also points out that B2B potentially offers an answer to the pan-European problem since a site could accept orders in one language, automatically translate into target languages for potential suppliers, and return the best bids in the original language of the would-be buyer.

      "body": "<p>The web is often cited as one of the major causes of stress in the workplace, and as anyone who has tried to dial up their free internet service provider at the weekend will know, recreational web use ain't exactly a one-way ticket to nirvana either. Virtual help is at hand, though (paradoxically, from the web itself), with sites designed to de-stress you. So, next time you want to takefive minutes to relax, don't run to the coffee machine, let the web take the strain instead. </p> <p>Relax-online.com has a particularly fab idea - relaxation \"tapes\" online. At <a href=\"http://www.relax-online.com/imageryonline.htm\">www.relax-online.com/imageryonline.htm</a> you can take a \"five-minute vacation\" or the mind-body relaxation trip I opted for. Listen via your RealPlayer as an American woman talks veeery slowly about releasing your \"inner strength and releasing stress\" and \"letting the tension tiger out of your walled garden\" (I made that one up). </p> <p>It's surprisingly effective, and I felt decidedly chilled out afterwards, although nervous for the next 24 hours that I hadn't been secretly programmed to kill the president. </p> <p>Mezzowave (<a href=\"http://www.mezzowave.com\">www.mezzowave.com</a>)is a superb example of what relatively simple web technologies (and the apparent consumption of a wheelbarrow full of recreational drugs) can achieve. You'll need Flash, but then you need Flash for any of the decent sites, so if you don't have it, bite the bullet and download this excellent free plug-in. </p> <p>The results are well worth it - the site's designers use ambient music and some gentle kaleidoscopicgraphics to \"chill you out\".

      "bodyText": "The web is often cited as one of the major causes of stress in the workplace, and as anyone who has tried to dial up their free internet service provider at the weekend will know, recreational web use ain't exactly a one-way ticket to nirvana either. Virtual help is at hand, though (paradoxically, from the web itself), with sites designed to de-stress you. So, next time you want to takefive minutes to relax, don't run to the coffee machine, let the web take the strain instead. Relax-online.com has a particularly fab idea - relaxation \"tapes\" online. At www.relax-online.com/imageryonline.htm you can take a \"five-minute vacation\" or the mind-body relaxation trip I opted for. Listen via your RealPlayer as an American woman talks veeery slowly about releasing your \"inner strength and releasing stress\" and \"letting the tension tiger out of your walled garden\" (I made that one up). It's surprisingly effective, and I felt decidedly chilled out afterwards, although nervous for the next 24 hours that I hadn't been secretly programmed to kill the president. Mezzowave (www.mezzowave.com)is a superb example of what relatively simple web technologies (and the apparent consumption of a wheelbarrow full of recreational drugs) can achieve. You'll need Flash, but then you need Flash for any of the decent sites, so if you don't have it, bite the bullet and download this excellent free plug-in. The results are well worth it - the site's designers use ambient music and some gentle kaleidoscopicgraphics to \"chill you out\". Pick the sphere you want: Space, Healing and so on. It provides \"the power of animation and music in a cutting edge chi energy enhanced relaxation, chill out and healing area\". Ignore the New Age tosh and just let the images and music relax your head. Another site that offers online audio and visual relaxation techniques is the Real Time Therapy site at click4therapy.com.

Zimmermann is the creator of Pretty Good Privacy - generally known as PGP. This software program, freely available over the net, enables anybody to encrypt their email. </p> <p>PGP was originally designed to help global human rights organisations that needed a way of communicating without endangering activists. It quickly became the de facto standard for email encryption because it was reliable, usable and free. But the virtually uncrackable program fell under the wary eye of the US government, and Zimmermann found himself at the centre of a three-year trial in the 90s. </p> <p>The case was eventually dropped, but Zimmermann's stand was critical in pushing the US government to back down and ease restrictions on the use and export of encryption. It also ensured ordinary computer users could continue downloading PGP for personal use. </p> <p>But Zimmermann is ready for something new. Last month, he announced he was leaving the encryption giant Network Associates - which bought his company, PGP, three years ago - and jumping to a small, Irish-based crypto firm, Hush Communications, as its chief cryptographer. \"Hush is doing interesting things with a different approach,\" he says. </p> <p>Network Associates has also taken a different approach lately, deciding to no longer publish the source code of PGP. That bothered Zimmermann, an open source advocate. \"I think it's important that crypto code be published for peer review,\" he says. Otherwise, there is no way of scrutinising it for possible back doors - secret entries that could allow surveillance of encrypted messages. </p> <p>Zimmermann would appear to mesh well with Hush. An American company that says it relocated its headquarters to the Irish Republic to avail itself of the more supportive environment for cryptography development, Hush produces commercial encryption products and offers free, web-based encrypted email called Hushmail (<a href=\"http://www.hushmail.com\">www.hushmail.com</a>). The company has a policy of providing its products free of charge to human rights and privacy groups. Last year, Hush paired with the UK privacy advocates Cyber Rights and Cyber Liberties to offer Britons free encrypted email that bypassed the restrictions of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act. (Asked if Hush might consider moving its office to Britain post-RIP, Hush's Dublin-based chief executive Jon Matonis laughed. \"No. Absolutely, we would not. It would be too restrictive.\") </p> <p>Hush, which employs only non-US citizens as developers, keeps its intellectual property in crypto-friendly Anguilla, West Indies, and retains the services of eight law firms. Now it is in the process of incorporating the PGP standard, called OpenPGP, into its encryption products. \"Phil will have a quality assurance role, to make sure the next release of our products interprets that OpenPGP standard correctly,\" Matonis says. </p> <p>Zimmermann says he is particularly interested in Hush's server rather than the old PC-based approach to encrypted email. The server allows people to access their encrypted email account from any computer. Zimmermann also says he liked Hush's determination to make the encryption process almost invisible to the user. </p> <p>The complexity of using so-called public key encryption - which utilises a public and a private key to encode and decode mail - is considered a prime reason why most consumers and businesses have avoided using encryption. Hushmail stores both encryption keys on a secure server and the encoding process is done automatically by a web browser-based Java applet, or small application. \"[Hushmail] is easily used by ordinary people who can sit down in a cybercafe and access their email,\" says Zimmermann. </p> <p>Hush has ambitious plans to expand in the e-commerce market. The server-based technology will also make online transactions secure, Matonis says, with encryption undertaken behind the scenes. Hush, which currently has 55 employees, will go after the same market as larger rivals such as Verisign, Entrust, Network Associates and Ireland's Baltimore Technologies. </p> <p>And with Zimmermann on board, the little company is sure to attract attention.</p>",

I learned how to record and mix bands and music. The first time I encountered a computer was using an ATM for a fleeting and practical need. That's still the way I use technology. I don't use it for the sake of it. I have an NEC Versa 4230 laptop PC because I'm on the road so much. </p> <p><strong> Is the net living up to its potential?</strong> We've only really just begun. Over the past five years the internet has phenomenally changed the way single people get to know each other. We did a survey of singles in the UK and found that more than half felt they could fall in love with someone they met online. I call it falling in love from the inside out. As we as consumers get our needs met more easily, quickly and efficiently, we'll begin to derive real benefits from, and see the real promise of, the net. </p> <p><strong> Is online dating capturing the imagination of the net community?</strong> Online dating has definitely come of age. In 1995 the concept was not necessarily understood and probably even deemed questionable. We've come to see that it's a sound business model - probably one of the better ones out there. Match.com is a subscription-based model. Our members can use many of the site's features free, including posting a profile, finding matches, reading and responding to dating-related content and attending some of our off-line events. If they wish to contact a match they subscribe. Fees are a month for \u00a317, six months for \u00a350 or a year for \u00a368. We've registered more than five million members, and have around 1.5m users on the site now, with at least 37,000 in the UK. We're registering around 14,000 new users a day. </p> <p><strong> Do you feel the net is still male orientated?</strong> I think that's changing. Among my peers I see more and more women getting online. I think it's still a case of \"if you build it they will come\". If there's content and services available for women online that meet their needs, they will log on. When we launched Match.com in 1995, only around 10% of the demographic of the net were women, whereas it's now risen to about 40%. </p> <p><strong> Is there a difference in surfing habits between genders?</strong> I think women use the net to make their day-to-day life easier. Their approach is practical. We book travel online, we date, we shop and do research online. I have a toddler and I'm constantly online answering the questions that a toddler asks, like \"how does a fish breathe?\". Men derive practical benefits, too, but I also think they have more fun online. They enjoy playing games and surfing to see what they come up with. </p> <p><strong> Any favourite places on the net?</strong> Because of my toddler I'm constantly going to Ask Jeeves (<a href=\"http://www.askjeeves.com/\">www.askjeeves.com/</a> ).

The internet is not an obvious place to make a fortune out of selling old economy goods.

Last week Sir Bob Geldof's Deckchair travel company laid off a third of its staff to seek a link with a rival online company. Part of the problem facing companies like Deckchair is that airtravel companies such as easyJet and Go have successfully cut out the middleperson by selling straight to customers. </p> <p>It could be argued that Amazon itself only exists because of the failure of publishers to get their act together by selling books directly to the public and cutting out the intermediaries. No one, ultimately, can sell books more cheaply than the publisher (or author). </p> <p>This year will see an acceleration of three trends.

We ring Ann Widdecombe's press officer, Nicole Hughes, to see if madam might be persuaded to chuck us another morsel from her bottomless pit of unfunny knee-jerk quotes. \"I'll have a try for you,\" promises Nicole. \u0095 Chillingly headed \"Bel Mooney Website\", the email this Diary has been dreading for some weeks arrives at last. \"Any possibility of an explanation as to why your plans for this haven't materialised??\" demands the anonymous sender. Lack of strength is the obvious answer, but it's a poor show, so www.bel-mooney.co.uk is reinstated as Website of the Month forthwith. The passage of time means Bel's spat with the Sunday Times magazine over spiked biker copy has been annexed to the Variety Show section of the site, but promising new items include a planned satellite TV show and a stilted reunion with an old school friend. More soon. \u0095 Maddeningly, we are no nearer taking a statement from the Times's managing editor George Brock on his love of country dancing. When we get though to his office, his PA says that George is away in the States until Monday and cannot be reached. Weaving Grand Ol' Right and Lefts with the products of vertical family trees, no doubt? \"I've got no idea,\" she giggles. \"He's at a technology conference.\" Ah well, till Monday, then. diary@theguardian.com",

Senior officers say the treaty setting up the court - which covers war crimes as well as genocide and crimes against humanity - could also bind British troops into such restrictive rules of engagement that their lives might be put at risk. A bill incorporating the UN-sponsored treaty into British law is going through the Lords before passing to the Commons. Iain Duncan Smith, the shadow defence secretary, said yesterday, he thought the government should put the issue \"on hold and think again about how they proceed.\" \"The problem is, how does this work against the very people who may themselves have to undertake the necessary military action to do that? He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme that if the court did come into effect there would almost certainly be pressure to prosecute Nato commanders if there was any repeat of incidents like the accidental attack on an Albanian refugee convoy by American warplanes in Kosovo. Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, chief of defence staff, echoed concerns expressed vigorously in private by his military colleagues, when he told the Commons armed forces bill select committee on Tuesday night he was not opposed \"in principle\" to the armed forces being subject to the proposed court. He added: \"I think we need to be very careful that, as the bill goes through, we don't put ourselves in a situation where a junior person carrying out orders ends up before the court.\" Lawyers for the Ministry of Defence - who were consulted before the bill was drafted - said the concerns expressed by the military were \"theoretical\".

Mladjan Dinkic said it was not yet clear who had profited from the sale of more than 700kg (1,500lbs) of gold, although a close Milosevic ally was a regular visitor to the mining complex. The news came as the UN war crimes tribunal in the Hague offered to try Mr Milosevic partly in the Yugoslav capital. The offer, announced in London by a deputy prosecutor, Graham Blewitt, is aimed at ending the impasse with Belgrade, which refuses to extradite him. He added that an new indictment charging Mr Milosevic with responsibility for war crimes in the Croatian and Bosnian wars, in addition to those relating to the 1999 Kosovo conflict, would be issued soon. Mr Blewitt said it would be legitimate for Serbia to try the dictator for fraud before he faced the tribunal, if the Serbians were ready first. Mr Dinkic's allegation followed a request by Serbian prosecutors for the police to investigate reports that Mr Milosevic sold 173kg of gold from the Bor mines in eastern Serbia in Switzerland last year and then deposited the profits abroad. The companies involved in those deals and the Yugoslav customs service deny that there were irregularities, and Mr Milosevic's supporters insist that the allegation is part of a witch-hunt. But Mr Dinkic, a key reformist, said that information given by mine officials showed that the Bor mines had sold gold illegally in each of the three years 1998-2000.He suggested that other, hidden, records would reveal much higher amounts. He said said that none of the evidence gathered so far led back to Mr Milosevic, but a close ally of the former president, the former federal deputy prime minister Nikola Sainovic, was reported to have visited the mine every Friday. \"Whether Sainovic has connections with Milosevic and whether he himself is linked to this still remains to be determined,\" he said. The gold sales would have breached the international trade embargo on Yugoslavia if the proceeds had gone to any of the blacklisted bank accounts belonging to Mr Milosevic, his family and aides, or to state companies. The Yugoslav customs chief, Vladan Begovic, said last week that the gold was processed for foreign firms and did not belong to the mine.

It also has a heart monitor named TruCCOMS, which measures the flow of blood more accurately than established technology. </p> <p>These ideas have sent investors' pulses racing, pushing the shares up ten-fold in two years. Unfortunately, in the words of one analyst, the management \"got greedy\". </p> <p>Aortech's cash call included \u00a330m to be spent on unspecified \"acquisition opportunities\", even though its healthy share price gave it leeway to use paper for any purchases. Chairman Gordon Wright and chief executive Eddie McDaid wanted to sell \u00a32m of their own shares at the same time, which never goes down well with investors. </p> <p>A further big slug of money was earmarked for research and development, although Aortech has been boasting that its main products are almost ready for launch. </p> <p>This is not the first time Aortech has upset its followers. Its interim results last year included a nasty surprise that animal trials on its heart valves would need to be repeated in the US. Its shoulder-shrugging attitude to this delay irritated investors. </p> <p>The firm abandoned its fundraising after a 30% fall in the shares over two weeks. The price dived further yesterday, down 10p to 522.5p. </p> <p>The debacle is embarrassing for adviser Morgan Stanley. Its implications for Aortech are more serious: the firm will run out of cash unless it can raise funds by the end of the year. </p> <p>Yesterday's closing price valued Aortech at \u00a3158m, which is cheap. But initial sales of TruCCOMS have been poor, and the launch of Elast-Eon has been put back to 2007. Prudent investors should sell.</p>",

These ideas have sent investors' pulses racing, pushing the shares up ten-fold in two years. Unfortunately, in the words of one analyst, the management \"got greedy\". Aortech's cash call included \u00a330m to be spent on unspecified \"acquisition opportunities\", even though its healthy share price gave it leeway to use paper for any purchases. Chairman Gordon Wright and chief executive Eddie McDaid wanted to sell \u00a32m of their own shares at the same time, which never goes down well with investors. A further big slug of money was earmarked for research and development, although Aortech has been boasting that its main products are almost ready for launch. This is not the first time Aortech has upset its followers. Its interim results last year included a nasty surprise that animal trials on its heart valves would need to be repeated in the US. Its shoulder-shrugging attitude to this delay irritated investors. The firm abandoned its fundraising after a 30% fall in the shares over two weeks. The price dived further yesterday, down 10p to 522.5p. The debacle is embarrassing for adviser Morgan Stanley. Its implications for Aortech are more serious: the firm will run out of cash unless it can raise funds by the end of the year. Yesterday's closing price valued Aortech at \u00a3158m, which is cheap. But initial sales of TruCCOMS have been poor, and the launch of Elast-Eon has been put back to 2007. Prudent investors should sell.",

The boy had been procured by a family servant who knew exactly what Maugham wanted but was too ashamed to admit it. Maugham later wrote about the event and insisted that he declined the offer. But the incident helped inspire his 1948 novella The Servant, in which a wily domestic first satisfies his master's needs then uses his weaknesses to dominate him. </p> <p>Robin Maugham, otherwise known as Robert Cecil Romer Maugham, 2nd Viscount Maugham of Hartfield, called his 1972 autobiography Escape from the Shadows, but he never really succeeded in escaping anything. His own father, the Lord Chancellor, declared The Servant obscene and tried to prevent its publication; his uncle, W Somerset Maugham, eclipsed him as a writer; and he was gay, at a time when having sex with another man could land you in prison. </p> <p>Even his one successful book was taken away from him. In 1963, The Servant was made into a film by Joseph Losey, who had fled McCarthyite America to become one of the best chroniclers of the changing face of 1960s Britain. Losey and the actor Dirk Bogarde had wanted to film Maugham's book since the early 1950s. Bogarde was to play Tony, the rich, indolent young man who buys a Chelsea town house and falls under the influence of his sinister manservant, Barrett. But by the time they made the film, Bogarde, who was also co-producer, was 42 and too old for the role. Instead he suggested James Fox for Tony and, after Ralph Richardson proved too expensive, he took the part of Barrett. </p> <p>But Losey's film, which transposed the story from the post-war austerity Britain to the early 1960s, was not quite Maugham's book. Not least because it had a different writer: Harold Pinter, making his screenwriting debut. Pinter's masterful screenplay captured the menace and sexual repression of the original but changed almost everything else except the two main characters. </p> <p>Maugham loathed it. \"It was quite dreadful,\" he said shortly before his death in 1981. \"The orgy scene at the end was a cock-up . . . It was perfectly obvious that Pinter had never been to an orgy.\" </p> <p>Maugham, who drifted into alcoholism, tried to reclaim the story. In the late 1950s, still feeling stifled by his uncle (also homosexual, but cushioned by his enormous literary success in the days before \"outing\" was commonplace), he attempted to turn The Servant into a play. But it did not please audiences in Worthing and never made it to the West End. After the film was released, Maugham tried repeatedly to turn his story into drama, well into the 1970s when he tried to interest Lionel \"Oliver!\" Bart in a musical version - an idea so bizarre, you wish it had happened. </p> <p>As theatre director and novelist Neil Bartlett says in a new introduction to The Servant: \"Maugham's story had a power over its author, which, despite his best literary intentions, he could never quite tidy away into a polite or finished form. A degree of wayward, unsettling anxiety and energy is the secret to all sensational or scandalous storytelling - it overrides the decorum of both writing and reading stories. Much of Maugham's story is clumsy, ugly, unresolved, incomplete; these are exactly the qualities that make it unforgettable.\" </p> <p>Bartlett, artistic director of the Lyric Hammersmith, is now turning The Servant into theatre. He has gone back to both Maugham's original and the 1958 stage adaptation to create a play that reverts to the confessional story-telling style of the original. Like so much of Bartlett's recent work, such as The Picture of Dorian Gray, it looks beneath the surface of the written word and overturns every grubby emotion to reveal our true attitudes to sex, class and ourselves. </p> <p>When the film of The Servant was released in 1963, the Profumo affair was being exposed, which seemed to reflect the collapse of \"upper-class decency\" in a morass of sex and lies. Yet, as Bartlett suggests, the tale may well be relevant today. Barrett, he claims, \"revels in the unspoken truth of post-war society: that the war and the welfare state have done nothing to alter the fact that the whole system exists only to maintain the comfort of the few.\" Robin Maugham may be largely forgotten, but we will never be able to forget The Servant. </p> <p>\u0095 Neil Bartlett's adaptation of The Servant is in preview at the Lyric Hammersmith, London W6.

      "byline": "Giles Tremlett",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Alex de la Iglesia is worried. The 34-year-old director of five films - three of them hits in his native Spain, one with a cult following across the world - is to receive his first major retrospective, courtesy of Manchester's Cornerhouse. Surely, he frets, something must be wrong. \"Does it mean I am getting old? I have only made five films. It seems ridiculous to talk about me having a particular style. I hate style.\" </p> <p>This young Basque, a former philosophy student at Bilbao's Jesuit university and writer of underground comics, is the most succesful of a new generation of Spanish directors. Inspired, sometimes nurtured, by Pedro Almodovar, this new pack - who include Bajo Ulloa and Santiago Segura - have now emerged as powers in their own right. De la Iglesia, whose darkly humorous films combine violence, slapstick and subversion, is their natural leader. </p> <p>His coming-of-age party at the Cornerhouse comes at a time when Spanish cinema is bursting with confidence and spilling over its own borders. Actors and directors are suddenly appearing on the global stage. Almodovar kicked off a remarkable year for Spaniards by winning last year's foreign film Oscar for All About My Mother. Now Javier Bardem has been nominated for a best actor Oscar for his portrayal of Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas in Julian Schnabel's Before Night Falls. His future in Hollywood, alongside the already established Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz, looks settled. In France, meanwhile, Sergi Lopez has just won a best actor C\u00e9sar for his role in Dominik Moll's Harry, He's Here To Help. </p> <p>The traffic is also beginning to move the other way. Nicole Kidman has just spent two months hidden away with director Alejandro Amenabar in a studio outside Madrid, working on a sinister Edgar Allan Poe tale. At the same time, Danny Aiello, Joe Mantegna and George Hamilton are working under director Manuel Gomez Pereira. De la Iglesia has also set his sights high. His next film, provisionally entitled The Return of Fu Manchu, will be shot entirely in English. Banderas has said he wants to play the cop; the director is hoping Michael Caine will take the title role. </p> <p>Of all the new pack of directors, De la Iglesia owes most to Almodovar. As a 23-year-old, he sent the director a proposal for his full-length film, Accion Mutante, along with a rough tape of a short that he was making. By the time he was called to see Almodovar, the short had run out of money and still had no sound. </p> <p>\"I had to do all the voices and the music while the film was running, and I made a complete, shameful idiot of myself,\" he explains. Almodovar, however, was impressed and took less than an hour to agree to produce Accion Mutante. \"I guess I just showed him how much I wanted to make films,\" says De la Iglesia. </p> <p>Two years later Spanish film-goers were presented with a tale about the adventures of an intergalactic, physically disabled terrorist group who kidnap the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Accion Mutante was spoof science fiction with added violence and an Almodovarian twist. There were buckets of blood and some truly repulsive heroes. It was not the sort of thing Spanish audiences were used to. </p> <p>\"You don't have to be serious and make films about the Spanish civil war. You can do other things,\" says De la Iglesia. He can barely conceal his impatience with art house directors. \"I can't stand people who put their own interests before those of the spectator. The audience has to enjoy it. That does not mean you cannot plant a series of ideas or concepts in their minds as well.\" </p> <p>Accion Mutante became - and remains - a cult movie for young Spaniards. It was enough of a success to guarantee its director a second film. El Dia de la Bestia (The Day of the Beast), starring Alex Angulo as a mad, bookish priest who works out that the Antichrist is about to appear in Madrid. The film was a massive hit in Spain, winning six Goyas and distribution deals around the world. </p> <p>The director was amazed and his ambitions grew. Within a few months he was in the US directing Rosie Perez, of Do The Right Thing fame, and Javier Bardem in Perdita Durango, a gory Tex-Mex road movie scripted by the author of David Lynch's Wild At Heart, Barry Gifford. Relentlessly violent, it failed in Spain but,even when cut by 10 minutes to avoid an X certificate, was a success elswhere. \"It is my best film,\" he states. Stephen Spielberg, an admirer of Bardem, praised it recently, saying he had watched it to the end despite his dislike of violent movies. </p> <p>The Spanish director's love of sex and violence does, however, pose a threat to his career prospects outside Spain. He hopes to start filming The Return of Fu Manchu in the autumn but refuses to tone it down. \"It is an action movie for adults. That means there has to be sex, death and love.\" </p> <p>While preparing Fu Manchu over the past three years he has also turned out a couple of domestic hits. Muertos de Risa (Dying of Laughter), which broke box office records on its first weekend, tells the story of two friends who form a succesful comedy duo, whose act involves them beating each other up on stage. They make everybody else laugh, but come to hate one another. Finally they kill each other on live television. </p> <p>The film stars Santiago Segura and El Gran Wyoming, two comic character actors who are popular in Spain but unknown elsewhere. \"In the States they tell me they are just like Abbott and Costello or Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis,\" says De la Iglesia. \"Every country has its own comic duo.\" </p> <p>La Comunidad, by far the most commercially successful of the 104 feature films made in Spain last year, has a similarly Spanish setting. Almodovar's former muse Carmen Maura plays an estate agent who discovers a suitcase full of money in a Madrid apartment she is trying to sell. The other neighbours have spent years waiting to get their hands on it, and will stop at nothing to keep the cash in the building. \"It is a horror film. It is as though she walks into a castle and finds it full of monsters,\" says De la Iglesia. </p> <p>La Comunidad will kick off the Viva festival, which opens next week. Alex de la Iglesia will be there to answer questions. Perhaps, by then, he will have come to terms with the fact that he is worthy of a retrospective. </p> <p>\u0095 La Comunidad, introduced by Alex de la Iglesia, opens the Viva! film festival at the Cornerhouse, Manchester, next Thursday. The festival runs until March 25. Box office: 0161-200 1500. De la Iglesia will also be at a screening of La Comunidad at the Metro, London W1, on March 16. Box office: 020-7734 1506.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alex de la Iglesia is worried. The 34-year-old director of five films - three of them hits in his native Spain, one with a cult following across the world - is to receive his first major retrospective, courtesy of Manchester's Cornerhouse. Surely, he frets, something must be wrong. \"Does it mean I am getting old? I have only made five films. It seems ridiculous to talk about me having a particular style. I hate style.\" This young Basque, a former philosophy student at Bilbao's Jesuit university and writer of underground comics, is the most succesful of a new generation of Spanish directors. Inspired, sometimes nurtured, by Pedro Almodovar, this new pack - who include Bajo Ulloa and Santiago Segura - have now emerged as powers in their own right. De la Iglesia, whose darkly humorous films combine violence, slapstick and subversion, is their natural leader. His coming-of-age party at the Cornerhouse comes at a time when Spanish cinema is bursting with confidence and spilling over its own borders. Actors and directors are suddenly appearing on the global stage. Almodovar kicked off a remarkable year for Spaniards by winning last year's foreign film Oscar for All About My Mother. Now Javier Bardem has been nominated for a best actor Oscar for his portrayal of Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas in Julian Schnabel's Before Night Falls. His future in Hollywood, alongside the already established Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz, looks settled. In France, meanwhile, Sergi Lopez has just won a best actor C\u00e9sar for his role in Dominik Moll's Harry, He's Here To Help. The traffic is also beginning to move the other way. Nicole Kidman has just spent two months hidden away with director Alejandro Amenabar in a studio outside Madrid, working on a sinister Edgar Allan Poe tale. At the same time, Danny Aiello, Joe Mantegna and George Hamilton are working under director Manuel Gomez Pereira. De la Iglesia has also set his sights high. His next film, provisionally entitled The Return of Fu Manchu, will be shot entirely in English. Banderas has said he wants to play the cop; the director is hoping Michael Caine will take the title role. Of all the new pack of directors, De la Iglesia owes most to Almodovar. As a 23-year-old, he sent the director a proposal for his full-length film, Accion Mutante, along with a rough tape of a short that he was making. By the time he was called to see Almodovar, the short had run out of money and still had no sound. \"I had to do all the voices and the music while the film was running, and I made a complete, shameful idiot of myself,\" he explains. Almodovar, however, was impressed and took less than an hour to agree to produce Accion Mutante. \"I guess I just showed him how much I wanted to make films,\" says De la Iglesia. Two years later Spanish film-goers were presented with a tale about the adventures of an intergalactic, physically disabled terrorist group who kidnap the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Accion Mutante was spoof science fiction with added violence and an Almodovarian twist. There were buckets of blood and some truly repulsive heroes. It was not the sort of thing Spanish audiences were used to. \"You don't have to be serious and make films about the Spanish civil war. You can do other things,\" says De la Iglesia. He can barely conceal his impatience with art house directors. \"I can't stand people who put their own interests before those of the spectator. The audience has to enjoy it. That does not mean you cannot plant a series of ideas or concepts in their minds as well.\" Accion Mutante became - and remains - a cult movie for young Spaniards. It was enough of a success to guarantee its director a second film. El Dia de la Bestia (The Day of the Beast), starring Alex Angulo as a mad, bookish priest who works out that the Antichrist is about to appear in Madrid. The film was a massive hit in Spain, winning six Goyas and distribution deals around the world. The director was amazed and his ambitions grew. Within a few months he was in the US directing Rosie Perez, of Do The Right Thing fame, and Javier Bardem in Perdita Durango, a gory Tex-Mex road movie scripted by the author of David Lynch's Wild At Heart, Barry Gifford. Relentlessly violent, it failed in Spain but,even when cut by 10 minutes to avoid an X certificate, was a success elswhere. \"It is my best film,\" he states. Stephen Spielberg, an admirer of Bardem, praised it recently, saying he had watched it to the end despite his dislike of violent movies. The Spanish director's love of sex and violence does, however, pose a threat to his career prospects outside Spain. He hopes to start filming The Return of Fu Manchu in the autumn but refuses to tone it down. \"It is an action movie for adults. That means there has to be sex, death and love.\" While preparing Fu Manchu over the past three years he has also turned out a couple of domestic hits. Muertos de Risa (Dying of Laughter), which broke box office records on its first weekend, tells the story of two friends who form a succesful comedy duo, whose act involves them beating each other up on stage. They make everybody else laugh, but come to hate one another. Finally they kill each other on live television. The film stars Santiago Segura and El Gran Wyoming, two comic character actors who are popular in Spain but unknown elsewhere. \"In the States they tell me they are just like Abbott and Costello or Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis,\" says De la Iglesia. \"Every country has its own comic duo.\" La Comunidad, by far the most commercially successful of the 104 feature films made in Spain last year, has a similarly Spanish setting. Almodovar's former muse Carmen Maura plays an estate agent who discovers a suitcase full of money in a Madrid apartment she is trying to sell. The other neighbours have spent years waiting to get their hands on it, and will stop at nothing to keep the cash in the building. \"It is a horror film. It is as though she walks into a castle and finds it full of monsters,\" says De la Iglesia. La Comunidad will kick off the Viva festival, which opens next week. Alex de la Iglesia will be there to answer questions. Perhaps, by then, he will have come to terms with the fact that he is worthy of a retrospective. \u0095 La Comunidad, introduced by Alex de la Iglesia, opens the Viva! film festival at the Cornerhouse, Manchester, next Thursday. The festival runs until March 25. Box office: 0161-200 1500. De la Iglesia will also be at a screening of La Comunidad at the Metro, London W1, on March 16. Box office: 020-7734 1506.",

      "body": "<p>The letter in painting is tantalisingly visible, plainly in view, yet absolutely mysterious. It is there for us to see yet, apart from the odd name or greeting - \"To the excellent Gisze in London, England\", says one of the letters hung on a letter rack in Hans Holbein's portrait of the 16th-century merchant, George Gisze - we cannot decipher its contents. </p> <p>Letters appear in art in letter racks like the one in Holbein's painting, or in the act of being written - with a quill pen and a pot full of ink, by a servant, in Gerard ter Borch's An Officer Dictating a Letter (1655-8); we see letters being sealed with wax, handed to a messenger, delivered and read. What we rarely see is the message inside, the words on the white sheet held up to the sunlight. The letter in art is an object of fascination precisely because its contents are obscure. </p> <p>Vermeer's paintings explore every scenario the private theatre of letter writing has to offer. He depicts men, and especially women, writing, reading, and receiving letters, yet never once is a word legible. Instead the letter itself is meaningful: we see the texture of the paper, its thinness, its whiteness. Letters are exchanged between the men and women of Delft with an email-like rapidity in Vermeer's paintings. </p> <p>In Mistress and Maid, a woman lays down her pen in the middle of writing a letter because she is interrupted by the delivery of a letter addressed to her. We guess the letter is from the person she is writing to, and interpret her response - she touches her chin in surprise - as alarmed, mystified. It's a moment of everyday drama. What makes letters dramatic in Vermeer's paintings is the unresolved intensity with which people concentrate on them: his letter writers and readers look at letters in silent absorption, searching each word for significance. You can feel them looking through the letter, trying to see the face of the writer, trying to decide if a particular expression is a sign of true love, false seduction, or just polite gallantry. They miss and want the person who sent the letter, they are brought together by the words, yet they read the letter alone. </p> <p>Vermeer's Woman in Blue Reading a Letter (c.1662-4) stands at a table before an open window, holding the crinkled letter up to the light; her face is lost in it and she seems upset, as if she's been told someone won't be coming after all. The sense of distance and absence is intensified by a map of the Netherlands on the wall behind her, and makes us feel the writer is far away. We feel the space between them. As the title of Vermeer's painting The Love Letter (c.1669-70) makes plain, the letters in his paintings are intimate, passionate, and secret. Letter writing is the perfect dramatic territory for him because it is private; his writers and readers are engaged in little domestic adventures, flirting by mail. </p> <p>Yet we only guess all this. The words are not for us to read. By involving us so intensely in a correspondence we cannot follow, Vermeer makes epistolary novelists of us all. We are invited to imagine what is on the page, to picture the loversealing a letter and giving it to a servant to send to this woman waiting in a quiet, neat room in Delft. Ambiguity makes the letters sinister as well as exciting. When Vermeer's women receive a letter, they look anxious rather than delighted. Interrupted as she plays the viola da gamba, the woman in The Love Letter looks at her servant with a note of warning, even as the servant laughs. She might be telling her to keep it quiet, or the servant might be threatening to make the letter public. Endless possibilities, a novel with no ending. </p> <p>Telling a narrative through letters was popular with early novelists: Samuel Richardson's Pamela is told entirely through letters and, like Vermeer's paintings, deals with women's lives, the domestic sphere. The letter has moved from the world of men and politics to that of women in love. Renaissance paintings use the letter as an index of male prestige: men in portraits open or seal letters as proof they are involved in the world of politics or business. In Mantegna's fresco of the court of Ludovico Gonzaga in Mantua, the women, children and animals are blissfully ignorant as the duke is handed a letter telling him the Sforzas in Milan desperately need his help. The letter is weighty, political; in the domestic Dutch art of Vermeer and his contemporaries, it becomes se cretive, personal. </p> <p>If 17th and 18th-century paintings of men and women sending letters occupy the same secluded, middle-class world as the early novel, they are more ambiguous. Richardson's Pamela gives us the actual letters the heroine exchanges with her lover; when the artist Joseph Highmore paints Twelve Scenes from Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1744), he removes Pamela from the novel's realism to the open-endedness of the image. In the first painting, she's interrupted writing a letter, but it's up to us to decide what it says - the words are unreadable. The letter in art is a clue to what art itself is. Images are a letter still in its envelope, whose significance we guess with anticipation or fear. A painting can be read like a story, but it can be seen as an object, too, like the letter itself. An unopened letter is a thing of paper and wax, whose meaning resides in its physical presence. </p> <p>In a painting like Chardin's Woman Sealing a Letter (1733), there are no words, and the physical action of sealing the letter seems meaningful, poetic, expressive. It's an elaborate ritual, as a servant holds a candle so she can dip her stick of red wax into the flame and lovingly seal the letter she has written with the quill on the table. Chardin systematically explores the visual world in opposition to the verbal: in this painting, there's a sense she need never even send the letter, that the meaning lies in the sensuality of letter writing, rather than the words on the page. Perhaps we don't need the words. Perhaps words are lies. That's the other tension in the faces of Vermeer's readers: can the letter be trusted? It's easier to lie on the page than face to face, and letters are easily interrupted on their journey from sender to reader. </p> <p>Safer by far to trust the physical presence of the letter, the love note written on paper you yourself gave your lover, scented with that favourite perfume. Vermeer and Chardin, in their celebrations of the physical ritual of letter writing and denigration of the words on the page, make an argument in favour of art itself, a defence of visual as opposed to verbal communication. They trust the obscure language of objects more than the noise of writing. </p> <p>This distrust takes its most extreme form in Jacques-Louis David's The Death of Marat (1793). Of all the shocking things in this painting of the French revolutionary leader Jean-Paul Marat dead in his bath - the naked, olive-tinged flesh of the corpse, the terrible modern emptiness of the composition, the way it is foreshortened, stripped of depth - nothing is quite as transgressive as the letter he holds in his hand, written by his killer, Charlotte Corday. For almost every previous artist, the letter had been an object signifying desire, its words unreadable, its meaning a delightful mystery; David shatters this convention. </p> <p>Corday's letter, written in a big, mad scrawl, faces us. We can read it. In reality, Corday got in to see Marat by hand-delivering a note offering to name conspirators against the Jacobin wing of the revolution. David makes her letter more like a disfigured love letter or, in today's terms, a nutty fan letter: \"It is enough that I am unhappy to deserve your good will.\" A self-indulgent, selfish request at a time of national emergency, and a lie, designed to get her close enough to stab him. In David's painting it is the generosity of Marat, his openness to the letter, the fact he has made time to read these deranged words, that has led to his death. Communication has been cut through with a knife: the letter is suspect and the writer a stalker. Just like Chardin, David finds the truth of the letter in its physicality rather than its words. The writing as a visual fact is too big, insistent, with an over-emphatic underlining of the name Marat. </p> <p>David's painting is modern in its alienation, its terror. In modern art, the suspicion of words becomes a fear that every word is a lie, communication a form of violence. Turner prize-winner Douglas Gordon sends messages that say \"It's over\" or \"Nothing can be hidden forever\", and the letter becomes a message without a context, scary and anonymous. The \"mail artist\" Ray Johnson founded The New York Correspondence School in the 1960s as a network of people willing to accept his bizarre mailings. A pop artist left behind by the art market, Johnson maintained his links with the art world through his letters. They feature collages, cartoons, puns, and are, quite self-consciously, a little creepy in their desperate desire to engage the recipient in some kind, any kind, of communication. For Johnson, the words don't matter: his letters have nothing to say. What he wants to affirm is communication itself, maintained through endlessly circuitous jokes, gossip and funny pictures. It wasn't enough: he eventually killed himself. </p> <p>Since death made him a cult, Johnson has become like Paul Klee's enigmatic painting, Letter Ghost (1937), in which a sealed envelope becomes a face with sad eyes: the spirit of the letter, the spectre of communication. The letter is a metaphor for art, in its physicality, its embodiment as paper, wax, a stamp, some squiggles. Before you read a word, you have an impression of a letter. When you read it, you might be more confused than when you just saw it as folded paper. You might know less, rather than more, about the person who sent it. Just like art.</p>",

A pop artist left behind by the art market, Johnson maintained his links with the art world through his letters. They feature collages, cartoons, puns, and are, quite self-consciously, a little creepy in their desperate desire to engage the recipient in some kind, any kind, of communication. For Johnson, the words don't matter: his letters have nothing to say. What he wants to affirm is communication itself, maintained through endlessly circuitous jokes, gossip and funny pictures. It wasn't enough: he eventually killed himself. Since death made him a cult, Johnson has become like Paul Klee's enigmatic painting, Letter Ghost (1937), in which a sealed envelope becomes a face with sad eyes: the spirit of the letter, the spectre of communication. The letter is a metaphor for art, in its physicality, its embodiment as paper, wax, a stamp, some squiggles. Before you read a word, you have an impression of a letter. When you read it, you might be more confused than when you just saw it as folded paper. You might know less, rather than more, about the person who sent it. Just like art.",

The explosion at a primary school in Jiangxi province on Tuesday occurred while pupils were putting fuses into firecrackers, a grieving parent said. The official toll so far is 41, most of them pupils aged eight or nine. \"When I saw a leg or an arm sticking out, I went after it,\" Ding Mingxing, one of the villagers who rushed to the scene, said. \"I rescued four kids, three boys and a girl, but I couldn't find my son.\" Mr Ding said the children were forced to assemble firecrackers to help the school financially. \"[The school authorities] called it 'supporting oneself through school by working',\" he said. \"The kids who didn't do the work were forced to pay fines.\" The explosion in Fanglin, Wanzai county, happened the day after the prime minister, Zhu Rongji, said in Beijing that China suffered from \"frequent occurrences of grave accidents\". Television stations showed a scene of complete devastation. Part of the school's second floor was reduced to rubble. Soldiers searched through bricks and rafters, some using their bare hands. Provincial leaders immediately returned from the national people's congress, where Mr Zhu made his comment, to take charge of the enquiries into the incident. County officials admitted that an accident with firecrackers might have been be to blame, but said that the investigation was still under way. Rural schools have been badly hit by economic reforms which have shifted education budgets on to local governments, which are often unable to pay teachers their full salaries or buy equipment. Villagers said that the fireworks enterprise had been set up by the headteacher with the help of the village's Communist party secretary. Mr Ding said that he and other parents had complained about the business to officials at a higher level, but the matter was not treated seriously. He said that the school was trying to fill a rush order in time for the Grave Sweeping Festival on April 5, when families tend their ancestors' graves and light firecrackers. About 190 people were inthe school at the time. Wanzai county is in a mountainous area of Jiangxi - one of China's least developed provinces - close to the border with Hunan. It has several fireworks exporting companies. Most of the rural people not working on the land are engaged in the fireworks business, and many of them assemble firecrackers at home. Last year more than 50 people were killed in two separate explosions caused by the illegal manufacture of fireworks in the province. The serious accidents of the type referred to by Mr Zhu include mining disasters, bridge collapses and river dykes washed away by floods.",

      "bodyText": "Ariel Sharon, vilified in the Arab world but embraced by his own people as a saviour they hope can contain the Palestinian uprising, took office as prime minister of Israel yesterday. Alongside the popular hope pinned on his national-unity government of seven parties, an atmosphere of dread was also apparent: if this coalition and this leader prove unable to bring peace to the country, Israelis wonder what options will be left. Mr Sharon presides over the largest government in Israeli history, embracing a third of the 120 MPs. It has 27 ministers and as many as 15 deputy ministers. But while his parliamentary majority looks rock solid - more than 70 members of the knesset, although his own Likud party has only 19 seats - he comes to power at a time when many Israelis feel despairing and powerless and the security forces are on high alert for attacks in Israel. The Islamist militant group Hamas, which says it was behind this week's suicide bombing in the coastal city of Netanya, has renewed a warning that it has ordered 10 suicide bombers to strike in Israel to mark Mr Sharon's installation as prime minister. Nabil Abu Rdainah, an adviser to the Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat, said yesterday that Mr Sharon faced a stark choice between resuming negotiations with the Palestinians and seeing more blood shed. The uprising in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has taken more than 420 lives in five months, almost all of them Palestinian. Mr Sharon refused to resume talks while the Palestinians are in a state of revolt. \"It's a moment of choice for the new Israeli government, a choice between a continuation of dialogue with the Palestinians [and] the continuation of a policy of siege of threats and pushing this process into a new escalation,\" Mr Rdainah said. Mr Sharon acknowledged the pressures, and the high expectations of his own people. \"I feel the weight of the responsibility, especially in this period,\" he told army radio hours before presenting his cabinet to parliament. \"I am sure that ,together with my colleagues in the government, we will know how to make the best response to the present dangers facing Israel.\" The Palestinians, and the world beyond, will be closely watching the ageing warrior; the Arabs have not forgiven him for his role in the Lebanese massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in Beirut in 1982, and for his ruthless expansion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Mr Sharon will make his first foray on the world state as prime minister on March 19, when he is expected to meet US leaders in Washington after speaking at the annual conference of a Israel lobby group. His huge cabinet - the price of securing the loyalty of Labour and other factions - is an unwieldy affair, which will be liable to deadlock because of its size and diversity, and contains the seeds of its own disintegration. It took a month for Mr Sharon to put it together, and he hopes it will allow him to stay in power where others have fallen, serving out a parliamentary term ending in 2003. His chance of survival was improved yesterday when parliament voted overwhelmingly to abolish the direct election of the prime minister, which was introduced after the assassination of the incumbent Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and has proved a destabilising factor in Israeli politics. But he presides over a fractious collection of left, right and religious parties. On the left stands the incoming foreign minister, Shimon Peres, the architect of a peace process which has been washed away by the blood of the hundreds killed in the past five months. On the far right stand Rechavam Ze'evi, the tourism minister, and Avigdor Lieberman, the infrastructure minister, who want Mr Sharon to use even more muscle against the Palestinians. Ordinary Israelis, who gave Mr Sharon two-thirds of the popular vote in the February 6 election, want him to go on the attack against the field commanders of the Palestinian intifada, and so do the hardliners in his cabinet. But that may not get easily past Mr Peres, who will push for a relaxation of the army's siege of Palestinian areas and the resumption of the peace negotiations. Mr Sharon could also face a rebellion in the Likud, where there is much frustration that his generosity to coalition partners has left the party with just eight ministerial seats. \"Looking at Sharon's cabinet, it looks like a multi-headed hydra, a concoction of ministers and deputy ministers, a cacophonous parliament disguised as a cohesive cabinet,\" Hemi Shalev, a columnist for the newspaper Ma'ariv, wrote yesterday. \"Long before he turns to deal with the Palestinians, Sharon will be forced to use a 'strong hand' merely to bring order around the cabinet table.\" \u0095 The Israeli army dug a trench around Bir Zeit University, the biggest Palestinian educational institution in the West Bank, yesterday, and cut off its telephone and power lines, just before the start of the summer term. Bir Zeit is seen as an activist centre. About 65,000 Palestinians were also cut off by the trench, human rights groups said. The Israeli peace group Gush Shalom called it an act of \"state terror\".",

The impression that he had given up was reinforced by his reluctance to discuss his plans for Paris or to mention his Socialist opponent, Bertrand Delano\u00eb. Instead, he attacked the Socialist philosophy at the national level, accusing the government of building an unjust society based on \"leftwing capitalism and a new religion - inequality\". The Socialists and Greens, who will fight the second round together, could win as many as three-quarters of the capital's 20 arrondissements , giving them control of local town halls. Plans are already being made for a celebration echoing the festivities after Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's presidential victory in 1981. Paris is seen as the key to next year's presidential and parliamentary elections, in which the Socialist, Communist and Green coalition could end up controlling all the main centres of power. Mr Delano\u00eb, a close ally of the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, has been given the chance to set a new social agenda headed by promises of more cr\u00e9ches, better health care, more council housing, the renovation of poorer areas, anti-pollution measures, and better public transport. Before his high-profile campaign for the mayoralty, he was best known for publicly stating his homosexuality - now seen as an asset in a city with an estimated 10% of its population gay, lesbian or bisexual.",

      "bodyText": "A dramatic and unexpectedly big rise in the numbers of Hispanic Americans recorded in the latest US census puts black Americans on the verge of losing their 200-year status as the biggest ethnic minority in the population of more than 281m. Results from last year's census show that there are now 35.3m people of Hispanic origin living in the US, compared to 36.4m black Americans. Since a significant minority of black Americans are also Hispanic, it is possible that the historic primacy of primarily English-speaking blacks is already at an end. Population projections have long indicated that the rise in the numbers of Hispanics will transform the traditional demography of the United States in the new century. They suggest suggest that Hispanics will overtake blacks around 2010. But early results from last year show that the process is taking place much faster than predicted. The numbers of Hispanics rose by nearly 60% in the decade since the 1990 census, from 22.4m in 1990 to 35.3m in the new census. The new total is about 3m bigger than population experts had expected. A US government official estimate late last year put Hispanic numbers at 32.8m. \"The earlier projections about US demography in the 21st century are all now going to have to be revised,\" Jorge Del Pinal, a senior census bureau official, said yesterday. Officials believe that the surge in Hispanic numbers may reflect the success of a big effort by the Clinton administration to ensure that last year's census succeeded in reaching minority communities of all kinds, some of which have traditionally feared the census. Poor standards of counting in the past may have made that earlier figures inaccurate, they said. Another reason could be a resurgence of cultural pride and confidence in some parts of the Hispanic community about identifying themselves as Hispanic, Mr Del Pinal said. The total number of black Americans increased from 30m in the 1990 census to 36.4m in 2000. The picture is complicated, however, by new options in the ethnic and racial sections of the census form last year which enabled Americans to identify themselves as belonging to more than one ethnic group. About 1.76m Americans identified themselves as both black and belonging to another group, leaving 34.7m Americans who considered that they were simply black. Detailed official census figures on race will not be issued until next week, but the Washington Post newspaper yesterday published the results of a preliminary examination of some technical studies about census accuracy which contained the new figures. Mr Del Pinal confirmed the broad accuracy of the figures yesterday. \"It's appropriate perhaps that it's happened at the beginning of the new century,\" Harry Pachon of the Rivera Policy Institute told the Post yesterday. \"It's a present-day reality of what the United States has become.\" . The new figures underscore one of the most profound social and cultural changes ever to affect the United States. The effect is particularly powerful in states such as California, Arizona and Texas, where bilingualism is increasingly part of everyday life. Nearly two thirds of the Hispanic population of the US comes originally from Mexico, 15% from central and south America, 13% from Cuba, and Puerto Rico, and the rest from other Spanish-speaking parts of the world, including the Dominican Republic. For all the prominence of such rich and powerful people as the singer-film star Jennifer Lopez and the baseball star Sammy Sosa, the overwhelming majority of Hispanics are among the poorest citizens of the US. The census figures also highlight an elusive aspect of modern American life, the fact that many Americans consider themselves to have multiple ethnic identities and are increasingly reluctant to be classified as either white or black. For exactly this reason, some civil rights groups opposed the census bureau's decision in the 2000 census to allow Americans to tick more than one ethnic or racial box on the census form. The figures will have a significant impact on the redrawing of electoral district boundaries, which is just about to begin.",

He looked up at me for the first time. \"Here's my ID number,\" I said, proffering my tax card. \"Uh-huh.\" \"And that's my passport, with my I-94 in it, as requested on your form.\" This time the pause was so long I could watch his wig grow. Supervisors were called over. The atmosphere grew tense. Over my shoulder I could see test-takers pressing buttons on the oversized computer tester. \"Railroad ahead,\" I said under my breath. \"Right lane narrows\". \"Here's your problem,\" says the clerk, backed up by his jumpy-looking supervisor.\"You need an I-94. This thing in your passport is an I-94W.\" I knew Dubya was going to be a disaster for America. \"But that's my visa waiver,\" I say, cheerfully. \"It means, if I wanted a visa, I could have a visa, but to save me going to all the fuss of queuing at the embassy, you, the Americas, because you like us, the Brits, so very much, don't require me to go and get the real thing. Although, if I wanted one, I could of course, have got one any time. \"Right?\" I say. The test-taking guy on my left is stuck on the stag warning sign, for Christ's sake. I could walk this. This turns out to be a prescient thought. \"Uh-huh,\" says Mr Wig again. \"I've studied very hard,\" I say sincerely. \"I know stopping distances.\" \"But you're not a US resident.\" \"For three months I am!\" \"Uh-huh,\" he says. So that is how I have learned that in America, \"Uh-huh\" means, absolutely no way, not ever, forget about it, go away please. To recap: I am on my way to Los Angeles. Where I know nobody.

Also it boosts your immune system, and all the minor symptoms of coughs, colds, throat infections will go down significantly.\" Mr Kadokawa, who runs a smiling school in Japan, had more concrete concerns. \" You can boosts sales 30% to 50% by smiling.\" His class, raised in an inscrutable culture, practised smiling widely with chopsticks in their teeth.

He demonstrated both the turned down smile, as seen when the bill turns up, and that fleeting, distressed rumple of the brow that indicates someone is lying (\"I want you to listen to me. I am going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman.\") </p> <p>I hardly needed professors to tell me that someone who smiles easily is likely to be happily married and that a look of contempt and disgust is an early warning of divorce. Curiously, the psychologist, who monitors such danger signals, claimed that the recipient of withering looks is vulnerable to infection for four years. </p> <p>John Cleese, whose natural element is incinerating rage, managed to get into a row with a robot, several computers, a passing motorist, Liz Hurley, his lovely assistant, and, of course, the BBC. Who are due to catch a nasty cold any day now. </p> <p>Meanwhile <strong> Coronation Street</strong> (Granada) is paying the price of filming well before transmission. Impervious to the smoke of funeral pyres, Fred Elliott, master butcher of this parish, is organising a Weatherfield-wide sausage competition. There is no suggestion that, at the moment, pigs have more pressing matters on mind. On the plus side, he has acquired an assistant, Boris, whose agitated eyebrows indicate that summat's going on backstage there. Though, admittedly, not much. Fred, Ashley and Boris, each fractionally dafter than the last, are strongly reminiscent of a music-hall act. Many successful Coronation Street partnerships seem to come spiritually somewhere between the sea lions and the Road to Mandalay.</p>",

I did not have sexual relations with that woman.\") I hardly needed professors to tell me that someone who smiles easily is likely to be happily married and that a look of contempt and disgust is an early warning of divorce. Curiously, the psychologist, who monitors such danger signals, claimed that the recipient of withering looks is vulnerable to infection for four years. John Cleese, whose natural element is incinerating rage, managed to get into a row with a robot, several computers, a passing motorist, Liz Hurley, his lovely assistant, and, of course, the BBC. Who are due to catch a nasty cold any day now. Meanwhile Coronation Street (Granada) is paying the price of filming well before transmission. Impervious to the smoke of funeral pyres, Fred Elliott, master butcher of this parish, is organising a Weatherfield-wide sausage competition. There is no suggestion that, at the moment, pigs have more pressing matters on mind. On the plus side, he has acquired an assistant, Boris, whose agitated eyebrows indicate that summat's going on backstage there. Though, admittedly, not much. Fred, Ashley and Boris, each fractionally dafter than the last, are strongly reminiscent of a music-hall act. Many successful Coronation Street partnerships seem to come spiritually somewhere between the sea lions and the Road to Mandalay.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Digital blow</strong><br> </p> <p> On March 1, Online reported on the problem of copyright violation through appropriation of the source code for web pages. </p> <p>This issue strikes at the heart of digital society. There are huge social benefits from the free reuse of source code, because otherwise everybody has to recreate the same basic techniques. </p> <p>But the original author should be rewarded for their work - if they give it away free, they can't earn a living. </p> <p>How can the web survive in these circumstances? The same question applies to \"open source\" systems such as Linux, and to the battles over Napster technology for bypassing copyright ownership. The lives of technologists, artists, and ordinary people depend on the answers. </p> <p>The Arts Council of England and the Cambridge University Computer Laboratory have recognised the need for debate that crosses the arts/technology divide, including opinion-formers, legal experts and policy makers. The resulting conference in Cambridge next month has a few places open to the public - details are at: <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/CODE/\">www.cl.cam.ac.uk/CODE/</a><br></p> <p><strong> Alan Blackwell</strong><br> <a href=\"mailto:alan.blackwell@cl.cam.ac.uk\"> alan.blackwell@cl.cam.ac.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Taxi please</strong><br> </p> <p> Re ordering a taxi via SMS (Online, March 1): What a ludicrous idea. Anyone who has ever used SMS or paging knows that messages cannot be guaranteed to arrive to a time like that. Your taxi may well turn up if your initial SMS arrives with the cab company within a reasonable time, but the confirmation messages are pointless and could arrive days late, if at all. As SMS facilities in European cities become more clogged with kids txtng 3ch thr, something ostensibly useful such as a way to book a taxi will become rapidly pointless, if it isn't pointless already. </p> <p><strong> Sam Nelson</strong><br> <a href=\"mailto:sam@cs.stir.ac.uk\"> sam@cs.stir.ac.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Suspicion</strong><br> </p> <p> SA Mathieson (Insight of the Law, Online March 1) quotes the idea that \"there should be reasonable suspicion of [benefit] fraud before a [bank] customer's information is surrendered\". Given the pressure claimants are under to have benefits paid directly into bank accounts (very convenient), the mere fact of claiming benefit seems to be sufficient excuse. </p> <p><strong> D. Cameron</strong><br> Stoke-on-Trent </p> <p><strong> Bemused</strong><br> </p> <p> Two letters on March 1 regarding Freeserve make me wonder. I have signed up for Freeserve Anytime but am beginning to wish I hadn't. It barely works at all. Connecting to the service is a pain. The dialup number has two components, namely a six-digit prefix and an 0845 call number. The first six digits are supposed to access the special free terminal arranged with BT, which then enables contact with the 0845 number. Almost invariably when my dialer has got as far as the prefix digits there is a click, then the charming computerised BT lady voice announces: \"The network is busy, please try later,\" or words to that effect. The following digits achieve nothing, although if you dial them separately, contact is established at once, but at a cost. </p> <p>On two occasions in the past week I have achieved access at the first dialing. Every other time I get the BT lady, and dial again and again, sometimes as many as 20 times before getting the proper connection noises. </p> <p>Three emails, a phone call to customer services and two expensive calls to the Freeserve \"help\" line only apologised and referred me to BT, who referred me back to Freeserve, saying there were not enough slots in the free connector for the number of customers, kindly explaining to me how the system works, which was interesting but didn't achieve anything. </p> <p>When eventually I do get through, I tend to do all my jobs at one go, which is not kind to other \"users\". As a senior nerd aged 83 how much time have I left? </p> <p>As your correspondent Jane Leaper remarked, anyone contemplating Anytime should think very carefully, and perhaps invest in a calendar rather than a stopwatch. </p> <p><strong> Henry Hudson</strong><br> <a href=\"mailto:henry@henhud.freeserve.co.uk\"> henry@henhud.freeserve.co.uk</a> </p> <p>In regard to David Ross's complaint on the tardiness of their email service, I have used the service for the past two years and have never encountered delays in receiving messages that could be attributed to FreeServe. The only delays have been when mail has been sent via a third party - where special interest group mail is sent through a moderator - who delays forwarding. I have come across friends who have thought that merely opening the Outlook Express inbox would automatically download mail from their ISP, not realising that they need to log on to their mail server. </p> <p>Thus they only got mail when they wrote a message and actively clicked the Send/Receive button. </p> <p><strong> Des Geere</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:des@dgeere.freeserve.co.uk\"> des@dgeere.freeserve.co.uk</a> </p> <p>My ISP is BTinternet, I use their \u00a39.99 per month service. I also use a telephone line from a cable company. But from March 31, to use my current service or similar service I will have to have a BT phone, which would be much more expensive. The only service open to those without BT phone lines is BT Internet Pay-as-you-go which I do not want.

      "bodyText": "Digital blow On March 1, Online reported on the problem of copyright violation through appropriation of the source code for web pages. This issue strikes at the heart of digital society. There are huge social benefits from the free reuse of source code, because otherwise everybody has to recreate the same basic techniques. But the original author should be rewarded for their work - if they give it away free, they can't earn a living. How can the web survive in these circumstances? The same question applies to \"open source\" systems such as Linux, and to the battles over Napster technology for bypassing copyright ownership. The lives of technologists, artists, and ordinary people depend on the answers. The Arts Council of England and the Cambridge University Computer Laboratory have recognised the need for debate that crosses the arts/technology divide, including opinion-formers, legal experts and policy makers. The resulting conference in Cambridge next month has a few places open to the public - details are at: www.cl.cam.ac.uk/CODE/ Alan Blackwell alan.blackwell@cl.cam.ac.uk Taxi please Re ordering a taxi via SMS (Online, March 1): What a ludicrous idea. Anyone who has ever used SMS or paging knows that messages cannot be guaranteed to arrive to a time like that. Your taxi may well turn up if your initial SMS arrives with the cab company within a reasonable time, but the confirmation messages are pointless and could arrive days late, if at all. As SMS facilities in European cities become more clogged with kids txtng 3ch thr, something ostensibly useful such as a way to book a taxi will become rapidly pointless, if it isn't pointless already. Sam Nelson sam@cs.stir.ac.uk Suspicion SA Mathieson (Insight of the Law, Online March 1) quotes the idea that \"there should be reasonable suspicion of [benefit] fraud before a [bank] customer's information is surrendered\". Given the pressure claimants are under to have benefits paid directly into bank accounts (very convenient), the mere fact of claiming benefit seems to be sufficient excuse. D. Cameron Stoke-on-Trent Bemused Two letters on March 1 regarding Freeserve make me wonder. I have signed up for Freeserve Anytime but am beginning to wish I hadn't. It barely works at all. Connecting to the service is a pain. The dialup number has two components, namely a six-digit prefix and an 0845 call number. The first six digits are supposed to access the special free terminal arranged with BT, which then enables contact with the 0845 number. Almost invariably when my dialer has got as far as the prefix digits there is a click, then the charming computerised BT lady voice announces: \"The network is busy, please try later,\" or words to that effect. The following digits achieve nothing, although if you dial them separately, contact is established at once, but at a cost. On two occasions in the past week I have achieved access at the first dialing. Every other time I get the BT lady, and dial again and again, sometimes as many as 20 times before getting the proper connection noises. Three emails, a phone call to customer services and two expensive calls to the Freeserve \"help\" line only apologised and referred me to BT, who referred me back to Freeserve, saying there were not enough slots in the free connector for the number of customers, kindly explaining to me how the system works, which was interesting but didn't achieve anything. When eventually I do get through, I tend to do all my jobs at one go, which is not kind to other \"users\". As a senior nerd aged 83 how much time have I left? As your correspondent Jane Leaper remarked, anyone contemplating Anytime should think very carefully, and perhaps invest in a calendar rather than a stopwatch. Henry Hudson henry@henhud.freeserve.co.uk In regard to David Ross's complaint on the tardiness of their email service, I have used the service for the past two years and have never encountered delays in receiving messages that could be attributed to FreeServe. The only delays have been when mail has been sent via a third party - where special interest group mail is sent through a moderator - who delays forwarding. I have come across friends who have thought that merely opening the Outlook Express inbox would automatically download mail from their ISP, not realising that they need to log on to their mail server. Thus they only got mail when they wrote a message and actively clicked the Send/Receive button. Des Geere des@dgeere.freeserve.co.uk My ISP is BTinternet, I use their \u00a39.99 per month service. I also use a telephone line from a cable company. But from March 31, to use my current service or similar service I will have to have a BT phone, which would be much more expensive. The only service open to those without BT phone lines is BT Internet Pay-as-you-go which I do not want. I have used BTinternet for several years and I had no wish to move website or change my email address but I will now be forced to as I will not be bullied into paying for one of BT's overly expensive lines. Andrew Aitken andrew.aitken@btinternet.com I don't want to seem to be joining a witch-hunt, but has anybody noticed how appaling their off-peak service has become? Since Sunday (February 25) I have been unable to log on, getting the busy signal for hours at a time. An email (from work) brought an anodyne soother referring to their installation of more hardware. Surely this should have been done before they launched a new marketing drive? Tim Bloomfield (email address withheld) Corrections On page 9, in our piece on booking cabs via SMS, the URL for the service, available in April, should have been www.obvious.co.uk. And on page 14, in our feature on web help for farmers, the address for Farming Online should have been www.farming.co.uk. Apologies for these errors.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Out of the Sonicblue</strong><br> </p> <p> Sonicblue, the company behind the Diamond Rio range of MP3 players, is now moving in on the CD personal market. Its debut player, the \u00a3170 Rio Volt PSX100, spins CD-roms loaded with MP3 files, as well as standard CDs, CD-Rs and CD-RWs. </p> <p>Its unique feature, however, is that it is the first to go on sale in the UK to playback Windows Media Audio (WMA) files stored on a CD-rom. The format's efficient compression system means a CD-rom can store at least 17 hours of near-CD quality WMA music - seven hours more than the 10 hours of MP3 files it can archive. </p> <p>The player is also the first on sale to feature the ID3 tagging system which flashes up the name of the artist and the track on the player's backlit LCD screen. </p> <p>Coming at the end of the month is the Rio 800, Sonic blue's newest addition to its MP3 player range. The model shares its styling and many of its features with the existing Rio 600 model. It will play back WMA files, and Apple fans should note that it is one of only a handful of MP3 players that is Mac-friendly. </p> <p>The Rio 800 also comes with a voice recorder and 64MB storage - twice that in the 600. It is expected to cost around \u00a3250. </p> <p><strong> Pretty pictures</strong><br> </p> <p> Philips is targeting gadget-grabbers with a new range of PC peripherals. </p> <p>Due at the end of March is the latest in its series of webcams, the \u00a3100 PCVC750K. This oval-shaped camera sits atop a PC screen and takes both moving and still images. </p> <p>Its unique facility is its built in-scanner which provides real-time transfer of text, images and 3D objects to the PC. Gadget-lovers will also enjoy using its voice recognition system that instructs the camera to automatically take a picture when the user says \"cheese.\" </p> <p>Philips also plans to offer an LCD monitor with an integrated TV tuner. Due to hit the shops in October, the 17-inch screen includes Teletext. Its picture-in-picture technology gives the user the option of surfing the net while watching a TV programme simultaneously. </p> <p>The company has also unveiled the Fisio 610, a GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) mobile phone that is more akin to current GSM models than it is the handheld PC type GPRS prototypes paraded by other makers. There's no colour screen or HTML-ready web browser - rather the Fisio offers always-on, fast downloading of Wap sites. Like other mobiles in Philips' range it offers voice activated dialling and control. Expect to see it in the stores when GPRS networks are fully up and running in the summer. An entire range of Fisio phones is slated to reach the market in June. </p> <p>Other accessories Philips is promising this year include a trio of LCD projectors priced at \u00a32,000-\u00a32,900, new LCD and CRT monitors and a range of flat speakers. </p> <p><strong> Mobile music</strong><br> </p> <p> Sony has become the latest manufacturer (after Samsung and Siemens) to offer a mobile phone that doubles as a music player. However, its CMD-MZ5 boasts a unique feature - an integrated ATRAC 3 converter. Using its accompanying analogue/ optical cable, music can be transferred to the mobile's Memory Stick storage card from any hi-fi device, not just from a PC. The phone also comes with a 64MB Memory Stick that the maker claims stores up to two hours of near-CD quality tunes. Rival models only have 32MB of storage. </p> <p>The phone also has a long battery life. Sony claims that after listening to two hour's worth of music, the phone has 60 minutes of talk time left. Music can be listened to either via a pair of earphones or through attachable powered speakers. </p> <p>Other facilities include a Wap browser, the ability to send and receive email from an existing account, a 500-space phonebook, a calendar and four games. </p> <p>The phone goes on sale in May priced at around \u00a3300-350. </p>",

This would have shown us we had a real lead in terms of speed, price (\u00a3299-\u00a3399), operating system and expansion slots compared to our nearest rivals, the Apple II and Sinclair Spectrum. </p> <p>\"The BBC Micro was twice as fast as the Apple II, and could integrate text and colour graphics on the same screen. And it had built-in networking, which no other computer had at the time.

If it had done so, Acorn would still be collecting the royalties and IBM might never have been able to establish what later became the Wintel (Windows and Intel) hegemony. </p> <p>Instead, even when it received offers to license its technology, such as a request from the home computer company Commodore to use its Econet networking system, it said no. \"We thought our wonderful, proprietary technology gave us an advantage over competitors, so we hogged it,\" says Hauser. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Acorn did want to sell PCs in the US. It set up a subsidiary with some managers it did not know very well and set about getting regulatory approval for its machines. This was very expensive and took a long time because of the unusually high number of devices that could be plugged into a BBC Micro. All had to be tested in connection with it, and the machine's radiation emissions also had to be reduced. </p> <p>Around $20m was sunk into the US operation, says Hauser, which contributed to the cash-flow problems the company experienced in 1983-5. Its share price plummeted and Olivetti, of Italy, bailed it out, eventually taking a majority stake. </p> <p>One thing it did get right - or almost right - was that it subcontracted the manufacture of its machines. However, its contracts with manufacturers were not flexible enough. So when it missed the Christmas slot for selling a new model, the Acorn Electron, which was followed by a dramatic downturn in demand for home computers, it could not stop its manufacturers making the machines. </p> <p>This was another blow to its cashflow. Research and development spending was too high and several times the company appointed senior managers who were more interested in technology than in the day-to-day mechanics of running a business. Hauser is happy to admit that he is not a good manager, though his enthusiasm for ideas helped give Acorn the buzz of a leading research lab. </p> <p>He says: \"The big obstacle to getting company culture right is to stop people falling out with each other. You also have to be tolerant. When one of our most brilliant members of staff told me he would be coming in to work on Monday dressed as a woman, I was a bit taken aback.

Hauser says: \"If I was still in the office between 7pm and 8pm, I would be getting really hungry, so I would treat anyone else who was around to a meal at the Italian Kitchen.\" </p> <p>Many of the company's most successful products started there, and there was a lot of competition to produce the best ideas. Also, there was real excitement about chip technology, rather like the excitement generated by the internet more recently. </p> <p>The BBC spotted the trend early and made a programme called The Chips Are Down, which predicted there would be a computer in every home. \"Some people thought this was the BBC getting weird,\" says Hauser. But at Cambridge University, where he studied physics and hung out with chip evangelists, \"it was an idea we really believed in.\" </p> <p>Hauser believed that to design a really efficient computer, you also needed to design the chip inside it. Originally, Acorn planned to use Intel's 286 chip in its Archi-medes computer. But because Intel would not let it license the 286 core and adapt it, Acorn decided to design its own. </p> <p>This became the ARM (Acorn Risc Machine) chip, designed by Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson, and implemented by Jamie Urquhart, now a director of ARM. By then, most people were buying IBM-compatible PCs because they were cheap and lots of software was available.

Element 14 was sold to Morgan Stanley, giving E14's management the option of buying it within three months, and Acorn's set-top box technology was sold to Pace Micro Technology for a nominal sum. </p> <p>To Hauser, Acorn has metamorphosed rather than died.

With its tasty graphics and relatively easy development environment, you would expect Sega's machine to be well stocked with talent. But, rather like those underperformers at Stamford Bridge, the Dreamcast is stuck with unplayable arcade conversions like Virtual Striker 2 and the tedious Sega Worldwide Soccer. While every footy fan has ample reserves of optimism, anyone hoping for a late winner will be sadly disappointed with the latest signing - European Super League. </p> <p>The game is not that bad, it is just depressingly average. For starters there are only 16 teams, which even when taking account of the vagaries of licensing, seems overly stingy. </p> <p>Then there's the game itself. Marvel at Zidane's accurately modelled bald patch and the admittedly impressive stadia but groan as the match kicks off. Unless the sprint button is held down, the players move with Le Tissier-like sloth, though without his control and poise; players often run past the ball rather than retrieving it. Throw in comical tackles, random shooting and a ball that fails to adhere to the laws of physics and you've got a dead cert for relegation. But play a little longer and the flaws recede slightly. </p> <p>Goals, while flowing too readily, are satisfying, and the slow pace allows a measured build-up. The graphics are smart, with the realistic venues adding something. Of course, all this talk of the realistic this and the accurately modelled that, tells you one thing: on the pitch, the game is destined to mid-table mediocrity. (GH)</p> <p><strong> Dice with Irvine but not Montoya</strong> <br></p> <p><strong> F1 Racing Championship</strong> PC<br>\u00a329.99 Ubi Soft ***** </p> <p> There's no shortage of F1 racing games, especially arcade racers running on games consoles. However, the serious player who wants a proper simulation is almost certainly playing Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix series, which started with Revs on the Acorn BBC micro. But GP3 is there to be overtaken. </p> <p>Coming up behind is Ubi Soft's F1 Racing Championship, the follow-up to F1 Racing Simulation, Monaco Grand Prix and other Ubi Soft efforts. Will the latest version, delayed until March 23, finally sweep past GP3? </p> <p>The answer, sorry, is that I can't say. I found F1RC virtually unplayable, not because of the quality of the game, but because it was like taking a night drive wearing Raybans. </p> <p>F1RC offers an impressive range of adjustments, down to the rigidity of rear anti-roll bars. When it comes to the graphics, you can decide whether or not to have tri-linear or anisotropic filtering, or both. But the programmers have left out the virtual knob for screen brightness, and even with the monitor turned up, the image on my PC was mostly black. (Ubi Soft says it was beta test code and no one else has had this problem.) </p> <p>Fortunately Ubi Soft has added a beginner mode for people who can't handle the amateur, pro and expert levels. This enables virtually anyone to win with any car. You can bounce off tyre walls and still extend your lead by 15 seconds a lap. In the dark. </p> <p>Step up to amateur, however, and it gets serious: the car becomes a pig to drive, and you can't treat the grass as an extension of the tarmac. The awkward placing of the read-outs does not help, especially the rev-counter half-way up the screen on the right. Mastering F1RC will take time and effort - probably more than mastering GP3. </p> <p>But when you get really good, you will be able to take part in the equivalent of real grand prix races against 21 other drivers, either on the internet or a local area net-work. Direct connection and split-screen modes are provided for two-player battles. </p> <p>While Ubi Soft claims FR1C is fabulously realistic, with tracks modelled to the nearest centimetre, one thing punctures the pleasure: the cars and drivers are based on the 1999 line-up. You can dice with Pedro de la Rosa, and back-end Irvine's Ferrari, but you can't touch wheels with Montoya. This may not trouble the serious gamer, who will hunt the web for new cars to download, but it will disappoint anyone who wants to play the current season. (JS)</p> <p><strong> A fun, vibrant user-friendly challenge</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Grandia 2 </strong> Dreamcast<br>\u00a339.99 Pinnacle/Ubi Soft ***** </p> <p> It seems like only yesterday that Grandia, the Japanese role-playing game, was launched on the western gaming world. In fact, it was around the middle of last week; it's just that the sequel has been translated more quickly than its predecessor. </p> <p>Not that Grandia 2 is your typical rushed rehash. This is a more grown-up affair, with properly fleshed-out characters. The story also has a little more weight: as brooding youngblood Ryudo, you hook up with the pious Elena and others in a bid to swing the ultimate battle between good and evil. </p> <p>The graphics, too, are a world away from the bland shades of Grandia, although this has much to do with the fact that this is on Dreamcast instead of PlayStation. Both character models and backgrounds are far more vibrant and detailed, and the combat animations are almost worthy of a PC game, although the characters' lack of faces means that empathising with your team is a doomed enterprise. </p> <p>One thing Grandia 2 has retained is the control system - no great shock, since the interface was undoubtedly one of the original's biggest pluses. Combat in particular is both user-friendly and fun. A hybrid of real-time and turn-based action, it is not dissimilar to that used in Final Fantasy. However, it does offer more possibilities: as well as simply attacking, defending and casting spells, you can evade attacks and even foil an enemy attack. You can choose to run away, or even avoid battles altogether. Not that you need to: even the bosses are relative pushovers. </p> <p>And this is the only area where Grandia 2 falls down. Not only are the battles easy, the puzzles wouldn't tax the average contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? This, combined with the linear storyline, makes it possible to finish a big game in less time than is usual for such a game. Having said that, it is refreshing to finish a game before the lease on your house runs out. (AB)</p>",

I found F1RC virtually unplayable, not because of the quality of the game, but because it was like taking a night drive wearing Raybans. F1RC offers an impressive range of adjustments, down to the rigidity of rear anti-roll bars. When it comes to the graphics, you can decide whether or not to have tri-linear or anisotropic filtering, or both. But the programmers have left out the virtual knob for screen brightness, and even with the monitor turned up, the image on my PC was mostly black. (Ubi Soft says it was beta test code and no one else has had this problem.) Fortunately Ubi Soft has added a beginner mode for people who can't handle the amateur, pro and expert levels. This enables virtually anyone to win with any car. You can bounce off tyre walls and still extend your lead by 15 seconds a lap. In the dark. Step up to amateur, however, and it gets serious: the car becomes a pig to drive, and you can't treat the grass as an extension of the tarmac. The awkward placing of the read-outs does not help, especially the rev-counter half-way up the screen on the right. Mastering F1RC will take time and effort - probably more than mastering GP3. But when you get really good, you will be able to take part in the equivalent of real grand prix races against 21 other drivers, either on the internet or a local area net-work. Direct connection and split-screen modes are provided for two-player battles. While Ubi Soft claims FR1C is fabulously realistic, with tracks modelled to the nearest centimetre, one thing punctures the pleasure: the cars and drivers are based on the 1999 line-up. You can dice with Pedro de la Rosa, and back-end Irvine's Ferrari, but you can't touch wheels with Montoya. This may not trouble the serious gamer, who will hunt the web for new cars to download, but it will disappoint anyone who wants to play the current season. (JS) A fun, vibrant user-friendly challenge Grandia 2 Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Pinnacle/Ubi Soft ***** It seems like only yesterday that Grandia, the Japanese role-playing game, was launched on the western gaming world. In fact, it was around the middle of last week; it's just that the sequel has been translated more quickly than its predecessor. Not that Grandia 2 is your typical rushed rehash. This is a more grown-up affair, with properly fleshed-out characters. The story also has a little more weight: as brooding youngblood Ryudo, you hook up with the pious Elena and others in a bid to swing the ultimate battle between good and evil. The graphics, too, are a world away from the bland shades of Grandia, although this has much to do with the fact that this is on Dreamcast instead of PlayStation. Both character models and backgrounds are far more vibrant and detailed, and the combat animations are almost worthy of a PC game, although the characters' lack of faces means that empathising with your team is a doomed enterprise. One thing Grandia 2 has retained is the control system - no great shock, since the interface was undoubtedly one of the original's biggest pluses. Combat in particular is both user-friendly and fun. A hybrid of real-time and turn-based action, it is not dissimilar to that used in Final Fantasy. However, it does offer more possibilities: as well as simply attacking, defending and casting spells, you can evade attacks and even foil an enemy attack. You can choose to run away, or even avoid battles altogether. Not that you need to: even the bosses are relative pushovers. And this is the only area where Grandia 2 falls down. Not only are the battles easy, the puzzles wouldn't tax the average contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? This, combined with the linear storyline, makes it possible to finish a big game in less time than is usual for such a game. Having said that, it is refreshing to finish a game before the lease on your house runs out. (AB)",

She kept repeating: \"Life has become an unbearable burden. I can no longer carry on.\" It was not because she was sharing her husband with another woman - it was Nafiye herself who had brought the woman home, to share her own responsibilities. It wasn't even the poverty. It was, she said, that life had lost its meaning. A month after we met, I heard she had \"liberated herself\" from that life. </p> <p>Thirty-eight women committed suicide in Batman last year and officials and specialists all agree that there is one main cause: lack of education. According to Turkish Ministry of Education figures from last year, 99.4% of boys started primary school as opposed to only 89.8% of girls. At secondary school and university, the percentage of women students is even lower. </p> <p>With the declaration of the republic in 1923, Turkey made a radical decision to turn her face towards Europe and, as the country modernised, women were given more rights and were encouraged to go to school. But despite this, women still get less support than men for their education, both socially and officially. </p> <p>In 1988, 16.7% of women aged 15-49 had no education at all. In areas where feudal relations remain strong, families give priority to their sons' education - daughters can stay at home or go out to work because, after all, the girl will marry and will not be responsible for making money for the family. That's the man's business. </p> <p>However, exposure to the realities of the modern world is forcing people to see how behind the times they really are. With television and internet cafes now widespread, even in remote corners of the country, families have begun to understand the importance of education for girls. </p> <p>In Batman, as in other parts of the region, women's organisations are setting up special classes for girls and their mothers, covering everything from reading and writing to carpet weaving. There has been a high uptake and the positive effects of these classes are evident. Some of the women here admit that they, too, have wanted to commit suicide in the past; everybody has their reason. \"But after this course, I am changed,\" one woman says. \"Now I can make my own plans for my own future.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Ferai Tinc is foreign policy columnist of H\u009frriyet Daily News.</p> <p><b>India</b></p> <p><b>Tavleen Singh</b></p> <p>You can be an Indian woman and spend your whole life in India, without ever seeing the cloistered, brutal world in which the average Indian woman lives and dies. My first glimpse of it came from a story I did more than 20 years ago as a junior reporter. The story was of a dowry death, though the term was unheard of in the early 70s, and through the short, sad life and terrible death of Kanchan, 22, I learned that the India in which I grew up had nothing to do with the India in which most Indian women live. </p> <p>My safe, middle-class India was a place of westernised boarding schools and English headmistresses who fed ideas of career and rebellion. The worst thing that could happen was an arranged marriage to a man who may turn out to be a philanderer or a brute. But there were always choices. </p> <p>In Kanchan's world, there were none. When she finished college, her parents started \"looking for a boy\". When they found one, they borrowed money and arranged the wedding. Her bridegroom was a stranger but she was told it was her job to \"adjust\". This was easy for her to accept, brought up as she had been on the old Indian idea that a girl is paraya dhan, somebody else's wealth, and that good Indian girls leave their parents' home as brides and return only as corpses. </p> <p>Kanchan found these ideas did not matter to her husband or his family. Only one thing did: she had not brought enough dowry. So began a year of beatings, abuse and brutality. She told her parents, pleaded for help; they reminded her she must learn to \"adjust\". She tried but her efforts were not good enough for her mother-in-law and sister-in-law, so one day they held her down, poured kerosene over her and set her on fire. Then they locked the door and left her to die. By the time the neighbours heard her screams, it was too late. </p> <p>Twenty years on, the big change is that most dowry deaths get reported. They rose from fewer than 500 per year in the 70s to more than 5,000 in the 90s. What remains unchanged is that most Indian women still have no choices and their voices remain unheard, except as occasional headlines, when sisters make suicide pacts to escape dowry demands and are found hanging from ceiling fans. </p> <p>The voices that get heard instead are those of educated, middle-class women. So for the past five years, the most important feminist issue in India has been the demand to reserve for women 33% of seats in parliament and the state legislative assemblies. </p> <p>If this becomes law, will it make a difference in that other India, where 20,000 rapes are reported every year and baby girls can be killed before they are born? Women legislators will make no difference unless society changes and society will change only through women's education. Literacy in Indian women, at just over 30%, is half that of men, so they often do not even know that their world is cloistered and brutal or that it does not have to be. </p> <p>\u0095 Tavleen Singh is senior columnist at India Today.</p> <p><b>Hong Kong</b></p> <p><b>Christine Loh</b></p> <p>Hong Kong women are among the luckiest in the world. They are well-educated and relatively wealthy, and the city's gross national product now exceeds that of the UK. But if there were a gross national happiness index, Hong Kong might not rank so high. </p> <p>Hong Kongers have an extremely stressful lifestyle in what is probably the world's fastest moving city. The go-go, high-octane charge is exhilarating but it can wear you down, and the pressure on women starts early. </p> <p>Children grow up in families in which both parents work and many mothers have little time to spend with their children. Instead they hire full-time, live-in helpers, women from south-east and south Asia who leave their families so they can earn enough abroad to send money home to give their children a better life. </p> <p>Girls are doing well at school, but boys have a higher chance of getting into the school of their choice, even with lower grades, because the system is skewed to produce sexual balance in co-ed schools. The Equal Opportunity Commission is currently taking the government to court over its school place allocation system. </p> <p>As they grow up, Hong Kong girls are bombarded by ads selling the image of the ideal woman - emaciated and unhealthy-looking. Yet women are also urged to eat. Fast food is everywhere but it is making us overweight and this is painful for women whose self-image is so often tied to body shape. </p> <p>Furthermore, in this highly materialistic society, shopping has become a hobby and a measure of wellbeing. For middle-and upper-class women in particular, there is enormous pressure always to be well-groomed. </p> <p>Time is what a woman finds hardest to have for herself. After coping with her job, the traffic jams and a stressed child with homework to do, she is exhausted. Her husband is equally stressed and intimacy in the bedroom falls by the wayside. </p> <p>The hidden pain among Hong Kong women is the issue of the mistress. With increasing travel to mainland China, the \"across-the-border mistress\" has become popular and affordable, even for men in low-income brackets such as truck drivers. For the mistress, it is a purely financial transaction. Her body and looks are assets which can help her to become better off - more like Hong Kong women. A few years ago, when a legislator suggested male waywardness should be criminalised, women responded angrily. </p> <p>Hong Kong women have made it in material terms, but we must find ways to feed ourselves emotionally and spiritually. And we fear that if we get off the treadmill, we will lose everything. </p> <p>\u0095 Christine Loh is a contributor to the South China Morning Post and CEO of a public policy thinktank.</p>",

Kanchan found these ideas did not matter to her husband or his family. Only one thing did: she had not brought enough dowry. So began a year of beatings, abuse and brutality. She told her parents, pleaded for help; they reminded her she must learn to \"adjust\". She tried but her efforts were not good enough for her mother-in-law and sister-in-law, so one day they held her down, poured kerosene over her and set her on fire. Then they locked the door and left her to die. By the time the neighbours heard her screams, it was too late. Twenty years on, the big change is that most dowry deaths get reported. They rose from fewer than 500 per year in the 70s to more than 5,000 in the 90s. What remains unchanged is that most Indian women still have no choices and their voices remain unheard, except as occasional headlines, when sisters make suicide pacts to escape dowry demands and are found hanging from ceiling fans. The voices that get heard instead are those of educated, middle-class women. So for the past five years, the most important feminist issue in India has been the demand to reserve for women 33% of seats in parliament and the state legislative assemblies. If this becomes law, will it make a difference in that other India, where 20,000 rapes are reported every year and baby girls can be killed before they are born? Women legislators will make no difference unless society changes and society will change only through women's education. Literacy in Indian women, at just over 30%, is half that of men, so they often do not even know that their world is cloistered and brutal or that it does not have to be. \u0095 Tavleen Singh is senior columnist at India Today. Hong Kong Christine Loh Hong Kong women are among the luckiest in the world. They are well-educated and relatively wealthy, and the city's gross national product now exceeds that of the UK. But if there were a gross national happiness index, Hong Kong might not rank so high. Hong Kongers have an extremely stressful lifestyle in what is probably the world's fastest moving city. The go-go, high-octane charge is exhilarating but it can wear you down, and the pressure on women starts early. Children grow up in families in which both parents work and many mothers have little time to spend with their children. Instead they hire full-time, live-in helpers, women from south-east and south Asia who leave their families so they can earn enough abroad to send money home to give their children a better life. Girls are doing well at school, but boys have a higher chance of getting into the school of their choice, even with lower grades, because the system is skewed to produce sexual balance in co-ed schools. The Equal Opportunity Commission is currently taking the government to court over its school place allocation system. As they grow up, Hong Kong girls are bombarded by ads selling the image of the ideal woman - emaciated and unhealthy-looking. Yet women are also urged to eat. Fast food is everywhere but it is making us overweight and this is painful for women whose self-image is so often tied to body shape. Furthermore, in this highly materialistic society, shopping has become a hobby and a measure of wellbeing. For middle-and upper-class women in particular, there is enormous pressure always to be well-groomed. Time is what a woman finds hardest to have for herself. After coping with her job, the traffic jams and a stressed child with homework to do, she is exhausted. Her husband is equally stressed and intimacy in the bedroom falls by the wayside. The hidden pain among Hong Kong women is the issue of the mistress. With increasing travel to mainland China, the \"across-the-border mistress\" has become popular and affordable, even for men in low-income brackets such as truck drivers. For the mistress, it is a purely financial transaction. Her body and looks are assets which can help her to become better off - more like Hong Kong women. A few years ago, when a legislator suggested male waywardness should be criminalised, women responded angrily. Hong Kong women have made it in material terms, but we must find ways to feed ourselves emotionally and spiritually. And we fear that if we get off the treadmill, we will lose everything. \u0095 Christine Loh is a contributor to the South China Morning Post and CEO of a public policy thinktank.",

In an attack on the QC system and the Lord Chancellor's role in it, the report questions why the government should be involved in a process which makes it possible for the top 10% of barristers to charge enhanced fees. The trade secretary, Stephen Byers, is expected to back proposals to apply the full force of competition law to the professions, in a statement in the Commons today. The Bar Council, which will face a tough battle to retain the existing system, reacted angrily, calling the report \"glib and dogged in its ignorance of how the interests of justice play a role in the issues at stake\". The report follows an investigation into restrictive practices in the legal, accountancy and architects' professions, announced by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in his 1999 pre-Budget report. Its publication on the day of the Budget signals the government's determination to expose professionals to the same market forces which apply to other suppliers of services. The director general of fair trading, John Vickers, says two of the three remaining distinctions between barristers and solicitors - bar rules banning barristers from practising in partnership, or seeing clients without a referral from a solicitor - have \"significant adverse effects\" on competition. The third distinction - the bar's refusal to allow barristers to handle the whole litigation process, limiting them to advocacy, advising and drafting court papers - \"prevents potential efficiencies and limits the numbers of lawyers who are able to conduct litigation on behalf of clients.\" The report's attack on the QC system was seen yesterday as ammunition for ministers who question government involvement in a system which enables senior lawyers to hit the public purse for higher fees.

One does not want to seem churlish-because Chris Smith has done great job in getting the money, its is great news for theatre and so badly needed - but I know am not alone in thinking this is unjust.\" The Arts Council insisted the money was a big step in countering many years of underfunding. A spokesman hinted there would be a \"few very big pleasant surprises\" and \"an overwhelming number\" of the country's producing theatres would benefit. \"The Arts Council was very clear in statements that this money was not just for the regional producing theatres.\" A large number of the 270 companies and theatres who would gain would have their budgets increased by a quarter or more, he said.",

Flight Sergeant Steven Fryer, 46, died alongside an unnamed colleague when the Minerva was caught by a freak wave as it tried to enter a harbour in rough weather, said Spanish police. Two other RAF colleagues suffered minor injuries and another two escaped unhurt. Visibility was understood to have been poor - it was still dark at 7.30am - as the Minerva sought to enter Guia Disora harbour in southern Tenerife following an overnight voyage from La Palma. The two dead were among five men who were pitched into the water. It is not yet clear what precisely caused the men's deaths.

It is good that Professor Begg's commission for integrated transport has published this data so quickly (Analysis, March 6). But there is no room for complacency. The blip to railway patronage after Railtrack speed restrictions last autumn resulted in a 3% increase in national road traffic volumes during October and November. On present trends this is an extra 100 road crash deaths.</p> <p>If the UK is to meet John Prescott's Kyoto greenhouse emission targets (Blair pledges green industrial revolution, March 7), then road traffic will have to be cut, not just the rate of growth reduced. Sadly the Begg commission has yet to promote any targets for cutting traffic volumes. While traffic adds to climate changes in the longer term, every year traffic kills about 25,000 people though crashes and toxic emissions.</p> <p>Most car journeys are short (70% under 5 miles long) and made in urban areas, where asthma and other respiratory diseases are a public health epidemic. If the NHS did not have to treat the victims of road traffic, it would have capacity to reduce waiting times for the treatment of unavoidable illnesses. Polluted water (and cholera) in the 19th century, polluted air (and respiratory diseases) are man made. We must set targets now for the highways agency and local highway authorities to plan for less motor traffic. For most people, a car free weekday would be a 20% reduction in use. <br><b>Prof Lewis Lesley</b> <br> Liverpool JM University <br><a href=\"mailto:transport-science@rapid.co.uk\">transport-science@rapid.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 Car user figures rose less than predicted. It was suggested this must be due to the increase in fuel prices acting as a disincentive. I offer another explanation. Many of us rural dwellers now work away from home because we have been forced to by financial considerations and lack of job opportunities. We cannot buy comparable houses for comparable prices in the cities.</p> <p>We thus travel long distances by rail at weekends and only short distances from our rented accommodation. I predict that next year figures of car use will rise sharply because the rail problems have put us back into our cars. Give us a reliable integrated public transport system and we will use it - no fuel hikes needed. <br><b>Gail Coleshill </b> <br>Crewkerne, Somerset</p> <p>\u0095 The prime minister perpetuates a dangerous mistake when he says the Kyoto targets would \"reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% of their 1990 levels by 2008-12\". Under Kyoto, only developed country emissions would be cut by 5.2%. Even if Kyoto is implemented in full, global emissions will rise by about 30%. <br><b>Titus Alexander </b><br>London <br><a href=\"mailto:titus@gci.org.uk\">titus@gci.org.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 Tony Blair highlighted the \"need to put business, technology and environmental protection in harness together\". He could take a further step and harness the research councils and department of trade and industry.

      "bodyText": "It is good news that road traffic volume only grew by 0.3% last year, when GNP grew by 3%. It is good that Professor Begg's commission for integrated transport has published this data so quickly (Analysis, March 6). But there is no room for complacency. The blip to railway patronage after Railtrack speed restrictions last autumn resulted in a 3% increase in national road traffic volumes during October and November. On present trends this is an extra 100 road crash deaths. If the UK is to meet John Prescott's Kyoto greenhouse emission targets (Blair pledges green industrial revolution, March 7), then road traffic will have to be cut, not just the rate of growth reduced. Sadly the Begg commission has yet to promote any targets for cutting traffic volumes. While traffic adds to climate changes in the longer term, every year traffic kills about 25,000 people though crashes and toxic emissions. Most car journeys are short (70% under 5 miles long) and made in urban areas, where asthma and other respiratory diseases are a public health epidemic. If the NHS did not have to treat the victims of road traffic, it would have capacity to reduce waiting times for the treatment of unavoidable illnesses. Polluted water (and cholera) in the 19th century, polluted air (and respiratory diseases) are man made. We must set targets now for the highways agency and local highway authorities to plan for less motor traffic. For most people, a car free weekday would be a 20% reduction in use. Prof Lewis Lesley Liverpool JM University transport-science@rapid.co.uk \u0095 Car user figures rose less than predicted. It was suggested this must be due to the increase in fuel prices acting as a disincentive. I offer another explanation. Many of us rural dwellers now work away from home because we have been forced to by financial considerations and lack of job opportunities. We cannot buy comparable houses for comparable prices in the cities. We thus travel long distances by rail at weekends and only short distances from our rented accommodation. I predict that next year figures of car use will rise sharply because the rail problems have put us back into our cars. Give us a reliable integrated public transport system and we will use it - no fuel hikes needed. Gail Coleshill Crewkerne, Somerset \u0095 The prime minister perpetuates a dangerous mistake when he says the Kyoto targets would \"reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% of their 1990 levels by 2008-12\". Under Kyoto, only developed country emissions would be cut by 5.2%. Even if Kyoto is implemented in full, global emissions will rise by about 30%. Titus Alexander London titus@gci.org.uk \u0095 Tony Blair highlighted the \"need to put business, technology and environmental protection in harness together\". He could take a further step and harness the research councils and department of trade and industry. At Strathclyde University we have had in the last six months proposals to establish a doctorate in energy and sustainable engineering rejected and a proposal to establish a Faraday Centre (linking universities and business) in dispersed clean energy systems meeting a similar fate. These didn't fail on the grounds of competence but because research funding is limited.

A long ball from the right from Steven Hampshire bounced at chest height before Scott Thomson flicked the ball over both Lennon and a bemused Robert Douglas. Despite several promising attacks, including a forced goal-line clearance from Agathe, Dunfermline's defensive torpor allowed Vega to head home again, this time from Moravcik's cross. Soon enough, Andrius Skerla fell all over Henrik Larsson in the box and Ian Ferguson repeated the indiscretion minutes later to allow the Swede to convert two penalties. \u0095Robert Tomaschek's goal gave Hearts a 1-0 win over Dundee in last night's other fourth-round replay. Celtic (3-5-2): Douglas; Mjallby, Vega, Valgaeren; Agathe, McNamara (Lambert, 62min), Lennon, Moravcik, Thompson; Larsson (Crainey, 81), Johnson (Petrov, 62). Dunfermline (3-5-2): Ruitenbeek; Doesburg (Bullen, 69), Skerla, Rossi; Hampshire, Nicholson, Ferguson, McGroarty, Dair (Dijkhuizen, 81); Crawford, Thomson. Referee: W Young. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to football.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk",

Perhaps it was expecting too much for them to keep on track against Pompey, especially bearing in mind that Graham Rix is now at the helm and desperate to prove he can cut it as a manager himself. </p> <p>Shreeves was upbeat, though, suggesting that Wednesday \"are now out of intensive care but still in the general ward. </p> <p>\"I see it as a point gained. It would have been nice to make it four wins out of five, but life is not always like that. We have taken 10 points from five games since I took charge and that's a good average in the jungle we find ourselves in. </p> <p>\"The trick is keeping that going, but the spirit in the dressing room is good.\" </p> <p>With better composure when it really mattered, Wednesday would have won the match. Their substitute Michele Di Piedi was the main culprit, pulling a shot wide of goal from six yards with only a couple of minutes remaining. </p> <p>Wednesday's keeper Kevin Pressman had earlier pulled off a superb save to deny Kevin Harper on 79 minutes. But long chunks of play elapsed without a single effort on goal at either end, with both sides desperate not to lose. </p> <p>Portsmouth, who played some fluent football, are by no means safe from the drop themselves. Now, to compound matters, they must await the verdict on the injured duo of Darren Moore and Thomas Thorgersen. </p> <p>\"Both look serious,\" Rix said afterwards. \"Moore is in hos pital with a shoulder injury and Thorgersen has damaged his knee. We will know better tomorrow.\" </p> <p>Portsmouth's new manager was delighted with a point, however. </p> <p>\"I would have settled for that before the game,\" he said. \"The lads battled, defended well and tried to play football. However, we will remain in trouble with a lot of other teams until such time as we are mathematically safe.\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Prior to last night's match, the Owls had won three of their four games under Shreeves's stewardship. Perhaps it was expecting too much for them to keep on track against Pompey, especially bearing in mind that Graham Rix is now at the helm and desperate to prove he can cut it as a manager himself. Shreeves was upbeat, though, suggesting that Wednesday \"are now out of intensive care but still in the general ward. \"I see it as a point gained. It would have been nice to make it four wins out of five, but life is not always like that. We have taken 10 points from five games since I took charge and that's a good average in the jungle we find ourselves in. \"The trick is keeping that going, but the spirit in the dressing room is good.\" With better composure when it really mattered, Wednesday would have won the match. Their substitute Michele Di Piedi was the main culprit, pulling a shot wide of goal from six yards with only a couple of minutes remaining. Wednesday's keeper Kevin Pressman had earlier pulled off a superb save to deny Kevin Harper on 79 minutes. But long chunks of play elapsed without a single effort on goal at either end, with both sides desperate not to lose. Portsmouth, who played some fluent football, are by no means safe from the drop themselves. Now, to compound matters, they must await the verdict on the injured duo of Darren Moore and Thomas Thorgersen. \"Both look serious,\" Rix said afterwards. \"Moore is in hos pital with a shoulder injury and Thorgersen has damaged his knee. We will know better tomorrow.\" Portsmouth's new manager was delighted with a point, however. \"I would have settled for that before the game,\" he said. \"The lads battled, defended well and tried to play football. However, we will remain in trouble with a lot of other teams until such time as we are mathematically safe.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

In his 20s, fresh out of Oxford, he took the literary world by storm, and at 28 was the youngest person ever to deliver the Christian Gauss lectures on literature at Princeton. He published books of criticism, single-handedly redefined poetry with his attack on what he dubbed the \"gentility principle\", and championed young poets such as Sylvia Plath. A long and distinguished academic career, punctuated by occasional weighty critical tomes, beckoned. But it didn't happen, and Alvarez, now 71, is glad he had the good sense to grow up. </p> <p>If he had carried on with life in what he once called the \"squirrel cage\", I might be heading up the steps to Alvarez's tall, sunny, exhaustively lived-in house in Hampstead to discuss his latest critical outpourings on poetry; as it is, I have come to talk about poker, a game he discovered just as his love affair with academe was beginning to fade. Poker: Bets, Bluffs and Bad Beats appears next week, Alvarez's second book on a game that has been an obsession for the past 40 years. His first, The Biggest Game in Town, about the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, appeared in 1983. Stu \"the Kid\" Ungar and Nick the Greek have well and truly replaced George Herbert and Richard Lovelace in Alvarez's critical pantheon. </p> <p>I am anxious to explore the curious trajectory of his career, to understand why he turned his back on academic life, gave up being poetry editor of the Observer (the platform from which he had launched his assault on well mannered English poetry), and stopped playing the literary game; or, rather, insisted on playing it by his own rules. \"I haven't really got a career,\" he says. \"All I have done is stayed independent. In a differently ordered culture, I probably would have had some sinecure professorship, but I was too early for that. I was always good at teaching; I just didn't like having colleagues.\" </p> <p>He had been back to his old Oxford college, Corpus Christi, the week before, and was given a tour by the new college president. \"It has the most beautiful library, where Erasmus worked, and every time I go to that library my heart goes out to it and I think I should have done this, I should have stayed on,\" he reflects. \"But then when you meet all the faculty, charming though they are, I realise it's not what I wanted to do, it's not how I could possibly have led my life. I did have the opportunity, but I thought, 'I don't want to spend my life writing books about other people's books'.\" </p> <p>In his new poker book, he recalls reading Herbert O Yardley's classic introduction to the game, The Education of a Poker Player, for the first time. It taught him how to play; but it also taught him some more important lessons. \"When I first began to play,\" he writes, \"I was in my late 20s and had the profound ignorance that often goes with excessive education. I had been through the most high-minded academic mill, read a vast number of books, and written a couple of my own, but in my personal life I was naive to a degree that still makes me blush. I had a marriage I couldn't handle, a childish desire to be loved by the whole world, and an equally childish conviction that everything would turn out right in the end . . . I was wrong.\" </p> <p>Very wrong. At 27, he married the 20-year-old grand-daughter of Frieda Lawrence (the widow of DH Lawrence) after a whirlwind romance, and they had a son. But the marriage was a disaster, triggering a bout of the depression that dogged Alvarez throughout his 20s, and caused him to attempt suicide in 1960. He drew on that experience in his best-known book, The Savage God, published in 1971, which explored the links between suicide and creativity. The other impulse driving that book was his friendship with Sylvia Plath, who had committed suicide in 1963. In his autobiography, Where Did It All Go Right?, he says that he failed Plath. \"I wasn't up to her despair and it scared me. My own suicide attempt was two years behind me, and I didn't want to go that way again.\" </p> <p>The autobiography ends with Alvarez's marriage in 1966 to his second wife, a Canadian child psychotherapist called Anne Adams. His reasoning: \"Happiness writes white. It does not show up on the page.\" He describes the book as the story of \"gloom and doom turning into pleasure\", and recalls the effect of meeting Zero Mostel, the comic actor, who became a close friend. \"When I first met him,\" Alvarez recalls, \"he seemed to represent everything that was lacking in my life. He was a galleon in full sail, laden with pleasure; I was a castaway, clinging to the wreckage. Being exposed to all that appetite and energy and hilarity made me realise that there was a world elsewhere.\" </p> <p>Alvarez bade farewell to academic life, cauterised his wounds with The Savage God, and wrote poetry, novels, and reportage for the New Yorker that eventually made its way into hard covers - The Biggest Game in Town; Offshore (based on his stay on a North Sea oil rig); and Feeding the Rat, about an unsung mountaineering friend. Climbing is Alvarez's other lifelong passion, though age and a busted right ankle mean he can no longer shin up sheer rock faces. </p> <p>\"Feeding the rat\" - testing yourself, exposing yourself to danger - has always been necessary to Alvarez. Poker is part of that, and he still puts his money on the table in London casinos a couple of nights a week, though he was forced to abandon a high-rolling game in which he played for 20 years when he suffered serious losses. \"Poker is about control,\" he says. \"It's like rock climbing. You see a television programme about rock climbing and you think these guys are insane, but it's not like that - it's all about working things out and being in control.\" </p> <p>Poker and climbing share another similarity that appeals to Alvarez - both are democratic. \"Nobody gives a shit what you do or where you come from as long as you sit down with sufficient money and ante up on time,\" he says. \"It's the same in the climbing world. I used to go more or less every weekend to a place called Harrison's Rocks, and there was an oddjob man, a guy who worked as a gardener, a security guard, a kid doing his O-levels, a tycoon in the software industry, and me.

If, for example, a family claims the bonus payment for a baby born in September, it will receive a lump sum backdated to the previous April and the rest through their pay packets on a monthly basis until the following April. </p> <p>Families on income-related benefits who will not benefit from the increases in WFTC or the CTC, will get an increase of \u00a31.50 a week in the child allowances in income support and jobseeker's allowance from October 2001, to match the rise in the CTC in this Budget. </p> <p>As announced in last year's Budget, child benefit goes up in line with indexation from April to \u00a315.50 for the first child and \u00a310.35 for subsequent children. </p> <p>Martin Barnes, director of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: \"This is a good Budget for families and children.

Its handouts were slight, its promises distant, its perspectives closer to five years than five weeks. It was like a matching reward for the two years of parsimony with which Gordon Brown began his tenure. Having started in 1997 by creating a first-term platform to prove how conservative he could be, yesterday he built one for the second term in which he and Tony Blair must show how socialistic, at heart, they really are. They have shown long-term rigour, almost to a fault.</p> <p>Given the size of the surplus, Mr Brown could have given far more away. Most of his predecessors would have done. He doesn't need to be paying down the national debt at this record-breaking rate. Given the imminence of May 3, or even June 7, he could have made blatant offerings to a much wider group of voters than families with children. But given that this is a Blair-Brown government, the most intimate and potent duumvirate of modern times, there was always a decent chance that it would exploit its political strength in order to take economically cautious decisions.</p> <p>Though they've kept a close eye on the voters, this is what they have done. Before the Budget, uprating of pensions and then the minimum wage reminded many millions that the government was listening. The ministers have looked after the masses. New micro-measures are targeted to keep motorists and hauliers and drinkers happy. But the larger politics of the Budget are almost counter-intuitive. They marry the long road of economic reform to the long life of those who now plan undeviatingly to traverse it.</p> <p>Over Mr Brown's five Budgets, the occasion has been transformed. The Budget is supposed to be an economic climax, and that's the way it is still treated. We all play the game. There are special supplements and ceremonially spacious television programmes. The details are breathlessly awaited. The rituals of pomp and circumstance have barely changed since the first Budget I can remember, which was Reginald Maudling's in the early 1960s.</p> <p>While happy to go along with such ornamentalism, Mr Brown has changed the substance into something else. His Budgets have grown into a cunning mixture of measures already leaked and other measures, especially taxes, that the Budget statement itself may omit to specify at all. Once the sacred unveiling of an economic secret, it has become an amalgam of the repetitious and, sometimes, the unrevealed. Once the occasion for a grand overview of the great forces that touched the famous Budget Judgment, it is now an interim statement of work in progress by the chief executive of UK plc.</p> <p>That's how Gordon Brown sounded yesterday, rattling through a long series of undifferentiated passages, no rise and fall, no break between, no rhetorical shape, some of them detailed, others vague, others alluding to future statements and documents to come. He seemed impatient more than triumphalist, though he had a happy story to tell. The great man was being briefly interrupted in his life's work of digging ever deeper into the entrails of the economy and society. He has been doing it, after all, for more than a decade - 24/7, as they say, every hour, every day, every week - since he was John Smith's deputy in the Kinnock shadow cabinet.</p> <p>So there was something peremptory in his lack of need to explain his final Budget of the first term. Far from awaiting this definitive statement, Budget-watchers are now meant to have kept up with the copious preliminaries. Anyone who missed those earlier speeches and half-revelations, the unrepeatable sub-texts of the Budget statement itself, doesn't deserve to understand the sheer critical mass of strategy that lies behind it, the long-termism, the profundity of Brown-Blairite social reforms.</p> <p>In this, Mr Brown is unlike any predecessor not only because of his own seriousness but because of the system he invented in the first week of his tenure. Handing monetary policy over to the monetary policy committee of the Bank was not only good for the stability of the economy. Almost as telling, it released the chancellor from the most neuralgic part of his job, fixing interest rates, thus giving a strategist such as Mr Brown time and space to undertake the deeper tasks for which he went into politics. Even in times as untroubled as the present, the aura of the monetary judgment in the old days would distract from the rest of the Budget.</p> <p>Freed from that, Mr Brown continues on his path. The philosophy of work as the cure for all deprivation is replenished with every Budget. No worries there about recent evidence that Brits work their backs off for longer hours than anyone in Europe. Whether beset by drugs or burdened with children, people have to pass the fit-for-work test, for which the state will provide sticks as well as carrots.</p> <p>That's the first common thread. The second, now, is the commitment to public services. The new billions announced yesterday were not as big as they could well afford to have been. It sounds as though the Treasury has been listening more than it would ever admit to the hyper-caution of the International Monetary Fund, which recently, to Mr Brown's rage, dared to cast a shadow of a doubt on his prudence.</p> <p>But in the second term, for which this Budget is designed, will come the major political test for Blairism. There is another, of which the chancellor is acutely aware, the lamentable record of the British economy, despite the fine general out-turn of the last five years, in productivity.</p> <p>A failure to make a serious impact on productivity over the next half-decade will leave the UK economy struggling against euroland. But the prime targets have to be education and health and crime, and also, I would say, defence, the quality of which will deserve to settle the fate of the Labour government by the end of the next parliament.</p> <p>Mr Blair and Mr Brown understand that. They have a complicated relationship. No prime minister and chancellor have been more equal. None have been at the same time such rivals and such friends. But they have got where they are together, and taken the country on a track they did not argue about. They had a common vision of how the first term should start and how it should end. Their history together may produce an explosive chemistry, especially when their respective acolytes get together and start making trouble.</p> <p>But the principals themselves have far more to be said for them than against them. The record Mr Brown was able to celebrate yesterday, however unexuberantly, did not have to happen.

      "bodyText": "This was not a Budget to win an election, but a Budget for an election that is already won. Its handouts were slight, its promises distant, its perspectives closer to five years than five weeks. It was like a matching reward for the two years of parsimony with which Gordon Brown began his tenure. Having started in 1997 by creating a first-term platform to prove how conservative he could be, yesterday he built one for the second term in which he and Tony Blair must show how socialistic, at heart, they really are. They have shown long-term rigour, almost to a fault. Given the size of the surplus, Mr Brown could have given far more away. Most of his predecessors would have done. He doesn't need to be paying down the national debt at this record-breaking rate. Given the imminence of May 3, or even June 7, he could have made blatant offerings to a much wider group of voters than families with children. But given that this is a Blair-Brown government, the most intimate and potent duumvirate of modern times, there was always a decent chance that it would exploit its political strength in order to take economically cautious decisions. Though they've kept a close eye on the voters, this is what they have done. Before the Budget, uprating of pensions and then the minimum wage reminded many millions that the government was listening. The ministers have looked after the masses. New micro-measures are targeted to keep motorists and hauliers and drinkers happy. But the larger politics of the Budget are almost counter-intuitive. They marry the long road of economic reform to the long life of those who now plan undeviatingly to traverse it. Over Mr Brown's five Budgets, the occasion has been transformed. The Budget is supposed to be an economic climax, and that's the way it is still treated. We all play the game. There are special supplements and ceremonially spacious television programmes. The details are breathlessly awaited. The rituals of pomp and circumstance have barely changed since the first Budget I can remember, which was Reginald Maudling's in the early 1960s. While happy to go along with such ornamentalism, Mr Brown has changed the substance into something else. His Budgets have grown into a cunning mixture of measures already leaked and other measures, especially taxes, that the Budget statement itself may omit to specify at all. Once the sacred unveiling of an economic secret, it has become an amalgam of the repetitious and, sometimes, the unrevealed. Once the occasion for a grand overview of the great forces that touched the famous Budget Judgment, it is now an interim statement of work in progress by the chief executive of UK plc. That's how Gordon Brown sounded yesterday, rattling through a long series of undifferentiated passages, no rise and fall, no break between, no rhetorical shape, some of them detailed, others vague, others alluding to future statements and documents to come. He seemed impatient more than triumphalist, though he had a happy story to tell. The great man was being briefly interrupted in his life's work of digging ever deeper into the entrails of the economy and society. He has been doing it, after all, for more than a decade - 24/7, as they say, every hour, every day, every week - since he was John Smith's deputy in the Kinnock shadow cabinet. So there was something peremptory in his lack of need to explain his final Budget of the first term. Far from awaiting this definitive statement, Budget-watchers are now meant to have kept up with the copious preliminaries. Anyone who missed those earlier speeches and half-revelations, the unrepeatable sub-texts of the Budget statement itself, doesn't deserve to understand the sheer critical mass of strategy that lies behind it, the long-termism, the profundity of Brown-Blairite social reforms. In this, Mr Brown is unlike any predecessor not only because of his own seriousness but because of the system he invented in the first week of his tenure. Handing monetary policy over to the monetary policy committee of the Bank was not only good for the stability of the economy. Almost as telling, it released the chancellor from the most neuralgic part of his job, fixing interest rates, thus giving a strategist such as Mr Brown time and space to undertake the deeper tasks for which he went into politics. Even in times as untroubled as the present, the aura of the monetary judgment in the old days would distract from the rest of the Budget. Freed from that, Mr Brown continues on his path. The philosophy of work as the cure for all deprivation is replenished with every Budget. No worries there about recent evidence that Brits work their backs off for longer hours than anyone in Europe. Whether beset by drugs or burdened with children, people have to pass the fit-for-work test, for which the state will provide sticks as well as carrots. That's the first common thread. The second, now, is the commitment to public services. The new billions announced yesterday were not as big as they could well afford to have been. It sounds as though the Treasury has been listening more than it would ever admit to the hyper-caution of the International Monetary Fund, which recently, to Mr Brown's rage, dared to cast a shadow of a doubt on his prudence. But in the second term, for which this Budget is designed, will come the major political test for Blairism. There is another, of which the chancellor is acutely aware, the lamentable record of the British economy, despite the fine general out-turn of the last five years, in productivity. A failure to make a serious impact on productivity over the next half-decade will leave the UK economy struggling against euroland. But the prime targets have to be education and health and crime, and also, I would say, defence, the quality of which will deserve to settle the fate of the Labour government by the end of the next parliament. Mr Blair and Mr Brown understand that. They have a complicated relationship. No prime minister and chancellor have been more equal. None have been at the same time such rivals and such friends. But they have got where they are together, and taken the country on a track they did not argue about. They had a common vision of how the first term should start and how it should end. Their history together may produce an explosive chemistry, especially when their respective acolytes get together and start making trouble. But the principals themselves have far more to be said for them than against them. The record Mr Brown was able to celebrate yesterday, however unexuberantly, did not have to happen. They made it happen. Political life was rather different the last time Labour was in power. Nearly four years in from the start of the 1974 government, Tony Benn recorded the state of things at the pre-Budget cabinet meeting, when Denis Healey had Mr Brown's job. \"Denis went on about industrial performance, design and marketing, just mouthing the phrases; in the end what we're saying is it's the working class that are responsible for all the troubles. I actually came away more depressed than I have ever been. \"Full employment is no longer on the agenda of a Labour government. They haven't even got a strategy for the 80s. They simply haven't got a strategy.\" Things have improved just a little.

      "body": "<p>The chancellor's final budget brought the curtain down on the end of New Labour, Act One with a mighty confident flourish. Flowers were thrown, opposition cabbages didn't even reach the stage. Now he retires to the dressing room to prepare for Act Two. Meanwhile the audience contemplates his grand opus so far, wondering what comes next.</p> <p>This last great performance gave us the chancellor in red mode, poor children's friend, the stealth-taxing secret socialist. No other word but redistribution describes how the money has flowed towards the poorest with a little taken from the top. Why, even his henchmen now use the wicked R-word once banned from New Labour's lexicon. Average and poorer families were again the target of his munificence, new mothers, child care, paternity leave - a budget for poorer women, so a new mother will be \u00a32,240 a year better off. Another 170,000 children will be lifted above poverty levels. And as more billions poured in for hospitals, schools, drug treatment, urban regeneration and myriad good causes - free museums, films, dilapidated churches, sports clubs - that now familiar Brown budget wonderment struck again.</p> <p>For who could imagine a Labour chancellor with \u00a316bn in his pocket, inflation licked, national debt and interest rates down, full employment within grasp? All pensioners (who claim) are in April lifted out of poverty - an unthinkable promise back in 1997, almost as extraordinary as ending child poverty. There has never been so big a step up for the poor. As for the rest? Good times brought jam to every social slice - 4% higher consumer spending each year, average living standards up rosily, mortgages an average \u00a31,200 cheaper, growth outstripping all predictions. Happy days and the best is yet to come, as the public spending jam rolls out in earnest now.</p> <p>So there are red roses aplenty for red Gordon. He has turned the political debate away from tax cuts - there were none, only extra credits for the poor. That was a crucial test of his nerve. How tempting with so much cash to knock another 1p off pre-election income tax. It was a 1999 error not repeated because it didn't need to be. Labour has gained in confidence since then and the public mood is with them - pressing for spending, not for tax cuts.</p> <p>This chancellor congratulates himself on long-termism, but after an excellent first act, the end of his story is still unknown, judgment too early to make. For all the feel-good glow each of his budgets brings, there remains the big long-term question. Will he effect a fundamental and long-term shift in Britain's tax and spend regime? The year 2003-2004 is the crunch by which time the spending now laid out must have delivered undeniable results in health, education and transport - with public services proud, well-paid and thrusting ahead for all to see. Current public patience will run out by then. Tory posters reading \"You paid the cash, so where are the nurses/teachers ...\" and so on make people snort with scorn at Tory cheek now - but not by then if change is not everywhere about to be seen. As people get yearly richer, so expectations of public services rise too. Never before has a Labour government produced increases in public investment above trend growth, and yet the big picture is still a history of under-spending.</p> <p>If it turns out that Act One was as good as it ever gets, then this first term was not enough. If recession rolls in on a dark tide from across the Atlantic, then we will look back and wonder how Labour did so little when the times were extraordinarily good. Why so timid, why so slow? The chancellor may have ended boom-and-bust but what we had instead in public spending was bust-and-boom. The depth of that bust is becoming ever more apparent: the price of prudence was painfully high. It will now not be until 2003-4 that Britain returns to the same level of public spending as a proportion of GDP that it inherited in 1997. A killer fact.</p> <p>Of course it is not quite as simple as that. Within that total, the huge sums previously wasted on unemployment and debt interest have been redistributed to excellent effect. But none the less, over any length of time, the amount a country taxes and spends defines fairly accurately the quality of its public service. We will still not be spending nearly enough. It was Tony Blair himself who promised NHS spending would meet the EU average, thus drawing attention to the yawning gap between Europe and Britain in every other public sphere as well. The disastrous failure to spend in 2000 - with a massive \u00a35bn capital undershoot - accidentally added to the time of famine, delaying results.</p> <p>Another killer fact is that, despite the quite radical redistribution by government, the gap between the rich and poor has still widened under Labour. It always happens in prosperous times, but Labour made no attempt to claw back any of the extra income flowing in to top earners - let alone taxing their growing capital wealth. Indeed, capital gains and inheritance taxes have shrunk to insignificance. Let the Tories grumble about Labour's \"45 new stealth taxes\", the big picture is still that the rich are getting richer faster than the rest and the poor are still being left behind.</p> <p>The ongoing comedy of Conservative policy - made not so much on the hoof as in the Magimix - gives Labour the chance to confront the tax question head on. William Hague, excited by George Bush's trillion dollar promise, now says he will make a mind-boggling \u00a3114bn tax cut. Suddenly lurching for a wild west alternative, the Tories now oblige Labour to talk honestly about tax. But an open advocacy of virtuous taxation has always been noticeably lacking in every Gordon Brown budget speech. He has extinguished public demand for tax cuts, but that's only half the battle.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor's final budget brought the curtain down on the end of New Labour, Act One with a mighty confident flourish. Flowers were thrown, opposition cabbages didn't even reach the stage. Now he retires to the dressing room to prepare for Act Two. Meanwhile the audience contemplates his grand opus so far, wondering what comes next. This last great performance gave us the chancellor in red mode, poor children's friend, the stealth-taxing secret socialist. No other word but redistribution describes how the money has flowed towards the poorest with a little taken from the top. Why, even his henchmen now use the wicked R-word once banned from New Labour's lexicon. Average and poorer families were again the target of his munificence, new mothers, child care, paternity leave - a budget for poorer women, so a new mother will be \u00a32,240 a year better off. Another 170,000 children will be lifted above poverty levels. And as more billions poured in for hospitals, schools, drug treatment, urban regeneration and myriad good causes - free museums, films, dilapidated churches, sports clubs - that now familiar Brown budget wonderment struck again. For who could imagine a Labour chancellor with \u00a316bn in his pocket, inflation licked, national debt and interest rates down, full employment within grasp? All pensioners (who claim) are in April lifted out of poverty - an unthinkable promise back in 1997, almost as extraordinary as ending child poverty. There has never been so big a step up for the poor. As for the rest? Good times brought jam to every social slice - 4% higher consumer spending each year, average living standards up rosily, mortgages an average \u00a31,200 cheaper, growth outstripping all predictions. Happy days and the best is yet to come, as the public spending jam rolls out in earnest now. So there are red roses aplenty for red Gordon. He has turned the political debate away from tax cuts - there were none, only extra credits for the poor. That was a crucial test of his nerve. How tempting with so much cash to knock another 1p off pre-election income tax. It was a 1999 error not repeated because it didn't need to be. Labour has gained in confidence since then and the public mood is with them - pressing for spending, not for tax cuts. This chancellor congratulates himself on long-termism, but after an excellent first act, the end of his story is still unknown, judgment too early to make. For all the feel-good glow each of his budgets brings, there remains the big long-term question. Will he effect a fundamental and long-term shift in Britain's tax and spend regime? The year 2003-2004 is the crunch by which time the spending now laid out must have delivered undeniable results in health, education and transport - with public services proud, well-paid and thrusting ahead for all to see. Current public patience will run out by then. Tory posters reading \"You paid the cash, so where are the nurses/teachers ...\" and so on make people snort with scorn at Tory cheek now - but not by then if change is not everywhere about to be seen. As people get yearly richer, so expectations of public services rise too. Never before has a Labour government produced increases in public investment above trend growth, and yet the big picture is still a history of under-spending. If it turns out that Act One was as good as it ever gets, then this first term was not enough. If recession rolls in on a dark tide from across the Atlantic, then we will look back and wonder how Labour did so little when the times were extraordinarily good. Why so timid, why so slow? The chancellor may have ended boom-and-bust but what we had instead in public spending was bust-and-boom. The depth of that bust is becoming ever more apparent: the price of prudence was painfully high. It will now not be until 2003-4 that Britain returns to the same level of public spending as a proportion of GDP that it inherited in 1997. A killer fact. Of course it is not quite as simple as that. Within that total, the huge sums previously wasted on unemployment and debt interest have been redistributed to excellent effect. But none the less, over any length of time, the amount a country taxes and spends defines fairly accurately the quality of its public service. We will still not be spending nearly enough. It was Tony Blair himself who promised NHS spending would meet the EU average, thus drawing attention to the yawning gap between Europe and Britain in every other public sphere as well. The disastrous failure to spend in 2000 - with a massive \u00a35bn capital undershoot - accidentally added to the time of famine, delaying results. Another killer fact is that, despite the quite radical redistribution by government, the gap between the rich and poor has still widened under Labour. It always happens in prosperous times, but Labour made no attempt to claw back any of the extra income flowing in to top earners - let alone taxing their growing capital wealth. Indeed, capital gains and inheritance taxes have shrunk to insignificance. Let the Tories grumble about Labour's \"45 new stealth taxes\", the big picture is still that the rich are getting richer faster than the rest and the poor are still being left behind. The ongoing comedy of Conservative policy - made not so much on the hoof as in the Magimix - gives Labour the chance to confront the tax question head on. William Hague, excited by George Bush's trillion dollar promise, now says he will make a mind-boggling \u00a3114bn tax cut. Suddenly lurching for a wild west alternative, the Tories now oblige Labour to talk honestly about tax. But an open advocacy of virtuous taxation has always been noticeably lacking in every Gordon Brown budget speech. He has extinguished public demand for tax cuts, but that's only half the battle. Hague's axe-man cuts require a broad and principled case to be made positively for taxes: they are not a \"burden\" if they buy the things that people want. Praise of public wealth can face down the Tory nostrum that we each spend our own money better than the government does. If Labour's 10-year plans work as well as intended, there will be good evidence that public money well-spent buys much more collectively than citizens can each buy individually. But such words never spring easily to the chancellor's lips. This was a prudent budget - no horse-frightening in the City before an election. But future budgets need more radical shifts. Too often New Labour appeases and buys off opposing forces: this third-way strategy makes few friends or permanent changes.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown's offer of tax breaks to encourage British pharmaceutical companies to wage war on \"killer diseases\" won cautious approval yesterday - and a warning that more could be done. The Budget held out the possibility of a 50% tax credit on research and development into medicines to combat malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/Aids in the developing world, following consultation with the drugs industry and other parties. Mr Brown also said he wanted the UK to push for a new international purchase fund for global health, \"that will not only develop new life-saving drugs but make existing drugs more widely available\". The proposals - first outlined in the pre-Budget report last November - call for discussions on incentives to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to increase its donations of drugs to developing countries.

      "body": "<p>An extra \u00a31bn over three years for schools includes more for books and repairs and \u00a3200m to tackle teacher shortages, the government's most pressing education problem.</p> <p>David Blunkett, the education secretary, said that under the overall package - \u00a3837m of which goes to England - the government will be spending \u00a3500 more per pupil than in 1997. Education spending will rise by 5.2% this year.</p> <p>A package to be published on Monday will include \u00a32,000 grants for returning teachers, expected to be mostly women who left to have children. They will receive \u00a3500 when they return to teaching and \u00a31,500 if they stay for a year.</p> <p>Those who return to subjects short of teachers - maths, science, technology, English and modern languages - will receive \u00a34,000 grants (\u00a31,000 up front, \u00a33,000 after a year), matching the \"golden hello\" to new graduates. An estimated 230,000 people who trained as teachers are working outside the system. Ministers hope the scheme will bring back about 2,000 over 18 months.</p> <p>Although the number of graduate recruits to teaching is rising - there are 2,300 more in training than last year - Mr Blunkett has accepted they will take time to get in post. He has conceded that some schools, particularly in the south east, are struggling to recruit, but he rejects talk of a crisis.</p> <p>Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"The chancellor's announcement is acknowledgement at last at the highest levels in the government of the depth of the crisis hitting teacher supply.\" He was doubtful whether former teachers would return for a \"\u00a32,000 bribe\", however.</p> <p>Repeating a popular move in last year's Budget, headteachers will receive direct grants to spend however they want - providing they go broadly towards raising standards. When the direct grants and capital grants are taken together, the smallest primary schools of under 100 pupils will receive an extra \u00a33,000 on top of the \u00a310,000 already promised. The larger ones will get \u00a363,000 instead of the previously announced \u00a350,000.</p> <p>Grants for secondary schools will rise from \u00a357,000 to \u00a368,000 for the few schools under 200.</p> <p>The very largest, of more than 1,200 pupils, will see their direct and capital grants rise in total from \u00a392,000 to \u00a3115,000.</p> <p>Overall, the direct grants are worth \u00a3100m a year in England. Ministers want the money to be spent on books, equipment and extra staff.</p> <p>Mr Brown also delivered an extra \u00a3100m a year for school building repairs. The money for capital spending will increase from \u00a319,000 to \u00a328,500 for a typical secondary and from \u00a36,500 to \u00a39,750 for a typical primary.</p> <p>Additional credits under the private finance initiative will be worth \u00a3200m next year and another \u00a3200m the year after. The government says it has delivered major refurbishments to 370 schools since the election but has a target of 650 by 2004.</p> <p>David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"I'm absolutely delighted that the chancellor has upped the ante and has increased the money going straight into school budgets to be spent by heads and governors as they wish.\"</p> <p>But Phil Willis, the Lib Dem education spokesman, said: \"This pre-election Budget bribe comes too late for thousands of teachers who have already left the profession.\"</p> <p><b>The Budget in

      "bodyText": "An extra \u00a31bn over three years for schools includes more for books and repairs and \u00a3200m to tackle teacher shortages, the government's most pressing education problem. David Blunkett, the education secretary, said that under the overall package - \u00a3837m of which goes to England - the government will be spending \u00a3500 more per pupil than in 1997. Education spending will rise by 5.2% this year. A package to be published on Monday will include \u00a32,000 grants for returning teachers, expected to be mostly women who left to have children. They will receive \u00a3500 when they return to teaching and \u00a31,500 if they stay for a year. Those who return to subjects short of teachers - maths, science, technology, English and modern languages - will receive \u00a34,000 grants (\u00a31,000 up front, \u00a33,000 after a year), matching the \"golden hello\" to new graduates. An estimated 230,000 people who trained as teachers are working outside the system. Ministers hope the scheme will bring back about 2,000 over 18 months. Although the number of graduate recruits to teaching is rising - there are 2,300 more in training than last year - Mr Blunkett has accepted they will take time to get in post. He has conceded that some schools, particularly in the south east, are struggling to recruit, but he rejects talk of a crisis. Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"The chancellor's announcement is acknowledgement at last at the highest levels in the government of the depth of the crisis hitting teacher supply.\" He was doubtful whether former teachers would return for a \"\u00a32,000 bribe\", however. Repeating a popular move in last year's Budget, headteachers will receive direct grants to spend however they want - providing they go broadly towards raising standards. When the direct grants and capital grants are taken together, the smallest primary schools of under 100 pupils will receive an extra \u00a33,000 on top of the \u00a310,000 already promised. The larger ones will get \u00a363,000 instead of the previously announced \u00a350,000. Grants for secondary schools will rise from \u00a357,000 to \u00a368,000 for the few schools under 200. The very largest, of more than 1,200 pupils, will see their direct and capital grants rise in total from \u00a392,000 to \u00a3115,000. Overall, the direct grants are worth \u00a3100m a year in England. Ministers want the money to be spent on books, equipment and extra staff. Mr Brown also delivered an extra \u00a3100m a year for school building repairs. The money for capital spending will increase from \u00a319,000 to \u00a328,500 for a typical secondary and from \u00a36,500 to \u00a39,750 for a typical primary. Additional credits under the private finance initiative will be worth \u00a3200m next year and another \u00a3200m the year after. The government says it has delivered major refurbishments to 370 schools since the election but has a target of 650 by 2004. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"I'm absolutely delighted that the chancellor has upped the ante and has increased the money going straight into school budgets to be spent by heads and governors as they wish.\" But Phil Willis, the Lib Dem education spokesman, said: \"This pre-election Budget bribe comes too late for thousands of teachers who have already left the profession.\" The Budget in detail At a glance: main points Full text of the speech Budget buzz words Interactive Guide to the Budget Comment Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away The view from the City: More theatrical than significant Audio Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06) Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins) Simon Hoggart's sketch Gordon Brown on the family Game Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget What do you think?

And he hinted that there would be a further widening of the lower band \"in the next parliament\". </p> <p>The 10p rate was first introduced in the 1999 Budget as part of the government's \"welfare to work\" mission when it replaced the previous lower band of 20 pence. </p> <p>But in last year's Budget, the government disappointed many by only increasing the band by \u00a320. </p> <p>Even now, pensioners and other savers will have to reclaim the tax through the Inland Revenue as banks and building societies still pay interest net of the 20p savings rate. </p> <p>While Age Concern welcomed the widening of the lower band, which it said would help \"older tax payers on modest incomes\", the charity's director general, Gordon Lisham, said it would be \"of no benefit to the 60% of pensioners who do not pay tax\". </p> <p>Higher earning employees will be hit by the changes announced in November's pre-Budget report, which increases their national insurance contributions (NICs) by 6.3% through the raising of the upper earnings limit to \u00a329,900 a year in the coming tax year. </p> <p>But lower earners will be better off as the lower earnings limit at which employees start to pay NICs will be raised to the same level as the income tax personal allowance. </p> <p>The well-heeled will also be disappointed that, despite previously indicating that a major reform on inheritance tax was on the way, the chancellor clearly did not see this as an election winner and has simply increased the threshold in line with inflation by \u00a38,000 to \u00a3234,000. This, he said, would mean that 90% of estates would not be subject to inheritance tax. </p> <p>Similarly, some have been disappointed that the capital gains tax threshold for individuals has been increased in line with inflation to \u00a37,500. </p> <p><strong>The Budget in detail</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><strong>Interactive</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><strong>Comment</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><strong>Audio</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><strong>Game</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><strong>Photo gallery</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><strong>Quiz</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><strong>What does it mean for me?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><strong>Public sector Budget analysis</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><strong>Chancellors</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><strong>Special reports</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>The chancellor declared he was offering a Budget for the family, and tax cuts were focused specifically on working families. Low and middle earning married couples with two children are by a wide margin the biggest winners.</p> <p>If they have a joint household income of \u00a320,000 to \u00a350,000 a year, net family income rises by \u00a31,828, or \u00a335.15 a week. This includes the benefit of the \u00a3520 children's tax credit and the widening in the 10% tax band and personal allowances.</p> <p>To give encouragement to parents, the children's tax credit, to be introduced next month, will be worth \u00a310 a week, \u00a31.50 more than announced in the pre-Budget report in November. The calculations below show the impact of children's tax credit and working families tax credit, but families will not automatically receive these benefits. Only 2.9m of the 4m PAYE families eligible for children's tax credit, which comes in April, have put in a claim. If they don't claim it, they won't get it.</p> <p>Childless, employed couples will also be enjoying a mini windfall. If each earns between \u00a310,000 and \u00a325,000 a year before tax, the government will effectively be giving the couple an extra \u00a31,308 a year. Single parents are next in the pecking order: they will be up to \u00a31,206 a year better off.</p> <p>Worst off are the single self-employed, represented below by Eastenders character Mark Fowler. A small businessman earning \u00a330,000 gains \u00a343.20 annually from the widening of the 10% tax band, while the increase in his personal allowance adds another \u00a333. What Mr Brown gives with one hand, he takes away with national insurance increases. NI changes lop \u00a3135 a year off the income of the self-employed businessman, leaving him with a net loss of \u00a359 a year. Owing to the peculiarities of national insurance, the single self-employed earning above \u00a340,000 moves back into positive territory, gaining \u00a3148 a year from yesterday's changes.</p> <p>If the tax cuts are spread over all income bands and all earners, the average household will be \u00a3240 a year better off, the chancellor said yesterday. He added that families with children will see an average gain of \u00a3420 a year. Pensioners were expected to be among the biggest beneficiaries of a pre-election Budget, but their income improvements are significantly smaller than those of younger, married people.</p> <p>It will also not be the poorest pensioners who will be getting the most. The retired person with an income of \u00a34,000 gets no extra benefit - because they don't pay tax anyway. The richer pensioners - a couple with an income of say \u00a330,000 each - will be receiving an additional \u00a3159 a year once all the measures announced yesterday come into effect.</p> <p>A lone pensioner like Margaret Meldrew, with a gross income of \u00a315,000, will receive an additional \u00a387.</p> <p>Otherwise the Budget involved tweaking at the edges. All of our stars below might benefit from the abolition of entrance fees to art galleries and museums, and most will be glad of the freezing of duty on wine, beer and spirits.</p> <p>And should the actors themselves need a cigarette to relieve stress in between takes, they will find their packet of 20 costing an extra 6p (in line with inflation) as of yesterday.</p> <p><b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>Comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

To give encouragement to parents, the children's tax credit, to be introduced next month, will be worth \u00a310 a week, \u00a31.50 more than announced in the pre-Budget report in November. The calculations below show the impact of children's tax credit and working families tax credit, but families will not automatically receive these benefits. Only 2.9m of the 4m PAYE families eligible for children's tax credit, which comes in April, have put in a claim. If they don't claim it, they won't get it. Childless, employed couples will also be enjoying a mini windfall. If each earns between \u00a310,000 and \u00a325,000 a year before tax, the government will effectively be giving the couple an extra \u00a31,308 a year. Single parents are next in the pecking order: they will be up to \u00a31,206 a year better off. Worst off are the single self-employed, represented below by Eastenders character Mark Fowler. A small businessman earning \u00a330,000 gains \u00a343.20 annually from the widening of the 10% tax band, while the increase in his personal allowance adds another \u00a333. What Mr Brown gives with one hand, he takes away with national insurance increases. NI changes lop \u00a3135 a year off the income of the self-employed businessman, leaving him with a net loss of \u00a359 a year. Owing to the peculiarities of national insurance, the single self-employed earning above \u00a340,000 moves back into positive territory, gaining \u00a3148 a year from yesterday's changes. If the tax cuts are spread over all income bands and all earners, the average household will be \u00a3240 a year better off, the chancellor said yesterday. He added that families with children will see an average gain of \u00a3420 a year. Pensioners were expected to be among the biggest beneficiaries of a pre-election Budget, but their income improvements are significantly smaller than those of younger, married people. It will also not be the poorest pensioners who will be getting the most. The retired person with an income of \u00a34,000 gets no extra benefit - because they don't pay tax anyway. The richer pensioners - a couple with an income of say \u00a330,000 each - will be receiving an additional \u00a3159 a year once all the measures announced yesterday come into effect. A lone pensioner like Margaret Meldrew, with a gross income of \u00a315,000, will receive an additional \u00a387. Otherwise the Budget involved tweaking at the edges. All of our stars below might benefit from the abolition of entrance fees to art galleries and museums, and most will be glad of the freezing of duty on wine, beer and spirits. And should the actors themselves need a cigarette to relieve stress in between takes, they will find their packet of 20 costing an extra 6p (in line with inflation) as of yesterday.

The newly married chancellor's financial package also includes an increase in maternity pay, longer maternity leave, a new paternity leave, more help with childcare costs for lower paid families and even a cut in the VAT rate on child car seats.</p> <p>The children's tax credit, which comes into effect next month, has been increased before it starts and there is extra help for small employers to enable more firms to recoup the cost of statutory maternity pay.</p> <p>Some of the moves were political necessities. Polls have shown that married women with children are among the most sceptical of New Labour, and the government was under pressure to help families after the abolition of the married couple's allowance.</p> <p>But the array of measures to help parents and children has confirmed Mr Brown's family-friendly credentials and underlined his commitment to address child poverty.</p> <p>Anne Longfield, chief executive of Kids Club Network, a charity for out of school childcare, said: \"These will be very popular measures. They provide help where people need it most. It will bring us more into line with Europe, where governments support and reward families. We are finally recognising that providing support for children is good for parents and for the community.\"</p> <p>The level of the children's tax credit had been set at \u00a38.50 a week, but it will now be \u00a310. It represents a tax cut for some 5m families with children under 16, the equivalent of nearly 3p off the basic rate of tax for a family on average earnings.</p> <p>From April next year, the credit will be doubled to \u00a320 per week for the parents of new babies for a year. Some 500,000 new parents will benefit.</p> <p>Many elements of the chancellor's package represent a victory for the former social security secretary Harriet Harman. She lobbied Mr Brown hard and did her own research to persuade him of the case for helping mothers - and fathers - to spend more time at home with young children.</p> <p>More than 4.5m women with dependent children now work outside the home, compared with 3.5m in 1984, and both parents now work in two-thirds of families - up from less than half in the 1980s.</p> <p>But for many women the costs of childcare are still a disincentive to take paid employment. For these Mr Brown had another carrot - an increase in the childcare tax credit component of the working families tax credit. From June he is hoisting the help available from 70% of childcare costs up to \u00a3135 for one child and 70% of \u00a3200 for two or more children. The current credits are \u00a3100 and \u00a3150.</p> <p>Ms Longfield said the increases meant the credits were now \"more in line with what childcare actually costs\", but noted out that they still offered only 70% of the full cost.</p> <p>The chancellor has also pledged to consider how to help with childcare for parents who work shifts and those with disabled children who require formal childcare in the home.</p> <p>Ms Harman discovered that new mothers felt pressurised to return to work, with half - in mainly low-paid jobs - returning when their babies were just weeks old in order to bring home more than the statutory maternity pay. Three-quarters of women do not use longer maternity leave entitlements \"for financial reasons\".</p> <p>Under the current system mothers are entitled to 40 weeks' maternity leave, but they get \u00a360.20 statutory maternity pay for just 18 weeks. From April 2002 maternity pay will go up to \u00a375 a week and from April 2003 it will rise to \u00a3100. At that time paid maternity leave will be extended from 18 weeks to 26, and a paternity leave - two weeks with \u00a3100pw - will be introduced. Adoptive parents will also now qualify for leave and pay.</p> <p>Last night Ms Harman said the reforms would help mothers stay with their babies longer. \"This will make a huge difference to mothers, and in political terms it is wonderful that these issues, which were just not on the agenda for so long, are now at the heart of a Budget.\"</p> <p>Christine Gowdridge of the Maternity Alliance, a campaign group which has pressed hard for improved maternity rights, said: \"This rise is redressing 30 years of neglect - it brings maternity pay back to what it ought to be if it had risen regularly since it was introduced in 1975.\"</p> <p>But there was concern about the chancellor's plan to compel lone parents with under-fives to attend \"work-focused\" interviews. The National Council for One Parent families warned that parents with infants could now \"feel pressurised into putting a job before their parenting responsibilities\".</p> <p><b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>Comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>The delivery was so brisk, the announcements rattled off at such machine gun speed, you could almost have missed the message. But once the order papers were waving and the chancellor was back in his seat, its significance began to sink in. Mr Brown has reshaped the British political landscape. He became yesterday the first chancellor of his party able to head into an election bragging about a record of extraordinary success: the lowest unemployment and inflation rates for a generation, eye-popping surpluses and a greater repayment of the national debt in one year than had been accomplished in the previous 50. Where his predecessors devoted their pre-election Budgets to crisis management, Mr Brown could boast about four years of economic stability. The once automatic association of Labour with economic incompetence is finally broken.</p> <p>The second tectonic shift in what happened yesterday goes to the heart of the long-term, centre-left project for Britain, fundamentally altering the terms of trade of our politics. For decades, the debate essentially ran on Conservative lines: whoever offered the lowest tax rates could be expected to win. That made elections a \"Dutch auction\" on taxes, with Labour routinely outbid by the slash-and-burn Tories. Yet yesterday Mr Brown could refuse the obvious trick - a penny cut in income tax - in favour of a mix of tax breaks targeted at the poorest and around \u00a32bn extra for public spending. In other words, he has chosen to stake Labour's electoral hopes on the belief that when voters face a choice between \u00a38bn worth of Tory tax cuts and Labour's promise of investment in schools and hospitals, they will go for the latter. If that is right, and every sign points that way, it marks a victory not just for Labour but for the whole progressive, social democratic cause.</p> <p>The mixture with which he achieved this is full of commendable things. Millions of families on low or modest incomes will get a huge boost through the complex bundle of benefits and tax credits now on the way. Pensioners, neglected before, have had a good deal and pegging the minimum income guarantee to earnings means the poorest will receive a 40% rise over the next 20 years. While much of that was predicted, one welcome surprise was an inner-city regeneration scheme that involves six tax cuts costing \u00a31bn over five years.</p> <p>But is even all this anywhere near enough? This government has to make up for decades of underinvestment, not least its own - most damagingly in its first two years in office. Even now, public spending at 39% of GDP remains below the spending levels of the Major, Thatcher, Callaghan, Wilson and Heath governments. There are still 3.2m children living in poverty, twice as many as in the last year of the last Labour government. And despite Mr Brown's carefully targeted increases in spending, inequality will continue to grow, because the poorest of the poor- unemployed, chronically sick or disabled people without children - only have benefits linked to prices, not earnings.</p> <p>All this is unfinished business. Yet even this pre-electoral moment was not a time for Mr Brown's faithful old servant Prudence to be retired.

      "bodyText": "The delivery was so brisk, the announcements rattled off at such machine gun speed, you could almost have missed the message. But once the order papers were waving and the chancellor was back in his seat, its significance began to sink in. Mr Brown has reshaped the British political landscape. He became yesterday the first chancellor of his party able to head into an election bragging about a record of extraordinary success: the lowest unemployment and inflation rates for a generation, eye-popping surpluses and a greater repayment of the national debt in one year than had been accomplished in the previous 50. Where his predecessors devoted their pre-election Budgets to crisis management, Mr Brown could boast about four years of economic stability. The once automatic association of Labour with economic incompetence is finally broken. The second tectonic shift in what happened yesterday goes to the heart of the long-term, centre-left project for Britain, fundamentally altering the terms of trade of our politics. For decades, the debate essentially ran on Conservative lines: whoever offered the lowest tax rates could be expected to win. That made elections a \"Dutch auction\" on taxes, with Labour routinely outbid by the slash-and-burn Tories. Yet yesterday Mr Brown could refuse the obvious trick - a penny cut in income tax - in favour of a mix of tax breaks targeted at the poorest and around \u00a32bn extra for public spending. In other words, he has chosen to stake Labour's electoral hopes on the belief that when voters face a choice between \u00a38bn worth of Tory tax cuts and Labour's promise of investment in schools and hospitals, they will go for the latter. If that is right, and every sign points that way, it marks a victory not just for Labour but for the whole progressive, social democratic cause. The mixture with which he achieved this is full of commendable things. Millions of families on low or modest incomes will get a huge boost through the complex bundle of benefits and tax credits now on the way. Pensioners, neglected before, have had a good deal and pegging the minimum income guarantee to earnings means the poorest will receive a 40% rise over the next 20 years. While much of that was predicted, one welcome surprise was an inner-city regeneration scheme that involves six tax cuts costing \u00a31bn over five years. But is even all this anywhere near enough? This government has to make up for decades of underinvestment, not least its own - most damagingly in its first two years in office. Even now, public spending at 39% of GDP remains below the spending levels of the Major, Thatcher, Callaghan, Wilson and Heath governments. There are still 3.2m children living in poverty, twice as many as in the last year of the last Labour government. And despite Mr Brown's carefully targeted increases in spending, inequality will continue to grow, because the poorest of the poor- unemployed, chronically sick or disabled people without children - only have benefits linked to prices, not earnings. All this is unfinished business. Yet even this pre-electoral moment was not a time for Mr Brown's faithful old servant Prudence to be retired. Having laid the basis for substantial increases in public spending over the next few years, his macroeconomic duty now was not to overegg the pudding, whatever the temptations. Despite the widely publicised public sector surplus - \u00a316.4 bn in the current financial year, against an original forecast of \u00a36.5 bn - to have \"given away\" anything like the lion's share in this Budget would in effect have been to invite the Bank of England's monetary policy commitee (MPC) to raise interest rates sharply. This is because, as the chancellor's forecasts show, domestic demand in the economy is expected to rise at over 3% in real terms this year and gross domestic product as a whole to carry on growing at about 2.5% a year. This rate, for all the chancellor's emphasis on raising productivity, is in line with what the Treasury and Bank of England regard as sustainable without putting excessive inflationary pressure on the economy. In this context, going ahead with targeted tax cuts of \u00a32bn and adding \u00a32bn. to public spending is well within the bounds of prudence. The concessions to the fuel protesters of some \u00a31.5bn come on top of that \u00a34bn, but are counterbalanced by lower debt interest and social security payments (the latter because of the higher level of employment). The additional growth in public sector investment over the next few years (up from 3.4% a year in real terms to 3.7%) is in any case set to turn the present surplus into a deficit before long. The projected deficits are well within the fiscal rules the chancellor has laid down (borrowing only for capital expenditure) and, even if these do not please the International Monetary Fund, they have not so far caused any obvious concern to the MPC. So the chancellor has hit on a sensible balance - but a balance which is only defensible if the momentum for public spending and public investment can be sustained and accelerated beyond a general election which yesterday's package should have helped to guarantee that Labour will win. Mr Brown's dream of a country where people get what they want from public services and where poverty is squeezed out of the system is going to demand more, much more, of the same.

      "body": "<p>Free entry to Britain's national museums and art galleries came a step closer yesterday after the chancellor announced changes in VAT. </p> <p>Until now any museum scrapping charges lost its business status and was not allowed to reclaim the VAT it paid on items it purchased. </p> <p>Yesterday's move rectifies this and fulfils the government's long-standing pledge to provide free access to museums and galleries. </p> <p>It was welcomed by campaigners, who said the old system had cost the institutions millions of pounds. The government will consult museums and galleries on the details of the scheme, which will be introduced by September. </p> <p>The V&amp;A in London, where visitor numbers halved after charges were introduced, immediately responded with a promise to reintroduce free admission \"as soon as possible\". </p> <p>The announcement ended a bitterly fought campaign. Culture secretary Chris Smith lobbied for the change, and the concession was anticipated in last year's Budget. There was deep disappointment when it failed to materialise. </p> <p>\"This is an outright victory, it is fantastic news,\" said David Barrie, director of the Art Fund, the independent charity which has led the campaign. \"I believe it will lead to a major extension of free admission. It is nice, for once, to be able to congratulate the government wholeheartedly on something really well done.\" </p> <p>Sir Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate, and Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery, praised the commitment of the culture secretary. \"Chris Smith has been an ardent and consistent advocate of the principle of free admission to the national collections. The benefits of his policy are vividly demonstrated by the huge number of visitors to Tate Modern,\" Sir Nicholas said. </p> <p>The initiative means the end of the much criticised compromise, Quids In, which would have given grants to museums to help cut their entry charges to \u00a31. It was supposed to start next autumn. </p> <p> <strong>The Budget in detail</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><strong>Interactive</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><strong>Comment</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><strong>Audio</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><strong>Game</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><strong>Photo gallery</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><strong>Quiz</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><strong>What does it mean for me?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><strong>Public sector Budget analysis</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><strong>Chancellors</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><strong>Special reports</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Free entry to Britain's national museums and art galleries came a step closer yesterday after the chancellor announced changes in VAT. Until now any museum scrapping charges lost its business status and was not allowed to reclaim the VAT it paid on items it purchased. Yesterday's move rectifies this and fulfils the government's long-standing pledge to provide free access to museums and galleries. It was welcomed by campaigners, who said the old system had cost the institutions millions of pounds. The government will consult museums and galleries on the details of the scheme, which will be introduced by September. The V&amp;A in London, where visitor numbers halved after charges were introduced, immediately responded with a promise to reintroduce free admission \"as soon as possible\". The announcement ended a bitterly fought campaign. Culture secretary Chris Smith lobbied for the change, and the concession was anticipated in last year's Budget. There was deep disappointment when it failed to materialise. \"This is an outright victory, it is fantastic news,\" said David Barrie, director of the Art Fund, the independent charity which has led the campaign. \"I believe it will lead to a major extension of free admission. It is nice, for once, to be able to congratulate the government wholeheartedly on something really well done.\" Sir Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate, and Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery, praised the commitment of the culture secretary. \"Chris Smith has been an ardent and consistent advocate of the principle of free admission to the national collections. The benefits of his policy are vividly demonstrated by the huge number of visitors to Tate Modern,\" Sir Nicholas said. The initiative means the end of the much criticised compromise, Quids In, which would have given grants to museums to help cut their entry charges to \u00a31. It was supposed to start next autumn.

Cas, 34, earns \u00a313,000 a year as a children and families social worker and Tom earns \u00a311,000 a year as a residential social worker. Until April 2001, they will be claiming working families tax credit at \u00a367 a week. </p> <p>Cas returned to work part-time when their youngest son, Freddie, was four months old, although she would have liked to stay off for longer. </p> <p>They pay \u00a3264 a month for childcare costs for seven half-day sessions at a council subsidised nursery. They cannot afford any more childcare sessions and Tom looks after their sons for the remaining three sessions. </p> <p>\"Childcare is so prohibitively expensive,\" says Cas. \"We have no choice but to pay for childcare because I work part-time Wednesday to Friday. Tom works on Saturday and Sundays and on Tuesday afternoons and evenings. Our childcare costs represent a quarter of what I earn every month, which seems very high. </p> <p>\"Since Labour came to power they have made a difference. Working families tax credit saved my life when I was on maternity leave with Freddie, even though I had to return to work earlier than I planned. If it hadn't been for this \u00a367 a week then we would have been significantly in debt. </p> <p>\"The increase in maternity pay would have been helpful for me when I was off on maternity leave with Freddie. I feel sad that I had to leave him so early, even though it was with his father. </p> <p>\"Looking after a young family is very stressful and we feel very stretched financially. It was a lot easier when I just had Charlie because I was able to save money. It was much more difficult when we had two. </p> <p>\"It is very irritating seeing the chancellor holding on to the purse strings so tightly. My wages are a pittance because I work in the public sector and we are on low incomes.\" </p> <p>The introduction of children's tax credit from April 6 will be worth \u00a3520 a year to them. The childcare element of the working families tax credit will also help. But Cas had hoped the chancellor would deliver more concessions to families. </p> <p>The flat they live in is worth \u00a3100,000, but they cannot afford to move to the area they would prefer because of their low wages. </p> <p>The couple do not smoke, mostly use public transport and only spend \u00a310 a week on petrol. </p> <p>\"It does not do enough to take the pressure off low income families,\" said Cas.</p> <p><strong>The Budget in detail</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><strong>Interactive</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><strong>Comment</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><strong>Audio</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><strong>Game</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><strong>Photo gallery</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><strong>Quiz</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><strong>What does it mean for me?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><strong>Public sector Budget analysis</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><strong>Chancellors</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><strong>Special reports</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\">HM Treasury Budget page</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

Cas returned to work part-time when their youngest son, Freddie, was four months old, although she would have liked to stay off for longer. They pay \u00a3264 a month for childcare costs for seven half-day sessions at a council subsidised nursery. They cannot afford any more childcare sessions and Tom looks after their sons for the remaining three sessions. \"Childcare is so prohibitively expensive,\" says Cas. \"We have no choice but to pay for childcare because I work part-time Wednesday to Friday. Tom works on Saturday and Sundays and on Tuesday afternoons and evenings. Our childcare costs represent a quarter of what I earn every month, which seems very high. \"Since Labour came to power they have made a difference. Working families tax credit saved my life when I was on maternity leave with Freddie, even though I had to return to work earlier than I planned. If it hadn't been for this \u00a367 a week then we would have been significantly in debt. \"The increase in maternity pay would have been helpful for me when I was off on maternity leave with Freddie. I feel sad that I had to leave him so early, even though it was with his father. \"Looking after a young family is very stressful and we feel very stretched financially. It was a lot easier when I just had Charlie because I was able to save money. It was much more difficult when we had two. \"It is very irritating seeing the chancellor holding on to the purse strings so tightly. My wages are a pittance because I work in the public sector and we are on low incomes.\" The introduction of children's tax credit from April 6 will be worth \u00a3520 a year to them. The childcare element of the working families tax credit will also help. But Cas had hoped the chancellor would deliver more concessions to families. The flat they live in is worth \u00a3100,000, but they cannot afford to move to the area they would prefer because of their low wages. The couple do not smoke, mostly use public transport and only spend \u00a310 a week on petrol. \"It does not do enough to take the pressure off low income families,\" said Cas.

There were also no exemptions for small employers facing employment regulations.\" </p> <p>Measures such as improved maternity pay and maternity leave put an especially heavy burden on small employers, which, although they are eventually reimbursed by government, have to carry administer and initially pay for the schemes, putting pressure on their cash flow. </p> <p> <strong>The Budget in detail</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><strong>Interactive</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><strong>Comment</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><strong>Audio</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><strong>Game</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><strong>Photo gallery</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><strong>Quiz</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><strong>What does it mean for me?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><strong>Public sector Budget analysis</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><strong>Chancellors</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><strong>Special reports</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\">HM Treasury Budget page</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>The Treasury signalled its intention yesterday to press ahead with modified plans to clamp down on tax avoidance by multinationals. </p> <p>Mr Brown caused an outcry with last year's Budget when he announced proposals to abolish the use of so-called mixer companies, employed by multinationals to smooth profits from various high and low tax jurisdictions abroad before they enter Britain to be taxed at a uniform rate. </p> <p>He later watered down the proposals to allow mixing as long as it was done onshore rather than offshore, where it is easier to avoid tax. </p> <p>In yesterday's Budget press releases - issued after Mr Brown's Commons address - the Treasury said that new regulations filling in the details of the proposals would soon be laid before parliament. </p> <p>David Norton, of accountant Anderson, said : \"They are very technical changes to highly complex rules but I think they aim to simplify things and are generally beneficial - although not every multinational will see things that way.\" </p> <p>Kate Barker, chief economic adviser at the Confederation of British Industry, said: \"It's a whole lot better than in the last Budget but it's still not as good as it should have been.\" </p> <p>In the wake of last year's announcement, the Treasury was besieged by multinationals who claimed they had not been consulted about the move. The chief executive of Vodafone, Chris Gent, issued a veiled threat to move Britain's biggest company to a more lax fiscal jurisdiction, such as Ireland. </p> <p>Ms Barker said large firms would be disappointed that the government had delayed implementation of the plan. </p> <p>\u0095 On Monday, the government will issue a further set of proposals for competitive reform of Europe's markets ahead of the Stockholm summit of finance ministers. The government's aim is understood to be harmonisation in Europe. </p> <p><strong>The Budget in detail</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><strong>Interactive</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><strong>Comment</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><strong>Audio</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><strong>Game</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><strong>Photo gallery</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><strong>Quiz</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><strong>What does it mean for me?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><strong>Public sector Budget analysis</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><strong>Chancellors</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><strong>Special reports</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\">HM Treasury Budget page</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Treasury signalled its intention yesterday to press ahead with modified plans to clamp down on tax avoidance by multinationals. Mr Brown caused an outcry with last year's Budget when he announced proposals to abolish the use of so-called mixer companies, employed by multinationals to smooth profits from various high and low tax jurisdictions abroad before they enter Britain to be taxed at a uniform rate. He later watered down the proposals to allow mixing as long as it was done onshore rather than offshore, where it is easier to avoid tax. In yesterday's Budget press releases - issued after Mr Brown's Commons address - the Treasury said that new regulations filling in the details of the proposals would soon be laid before parliament. David Norton, of accountant Anderson, said : \"They are very technical changes to highly complex rules but I think they aim to simplify things and are generally beneficial - although not every multinational will see things that way.\" Kate Barker, chief economic adviser at the Confederation of British Industry, said: \"It's a whole lot better than in the last Budget but it's still not as good as it should have been.\" In the wake of last year's announcement, the Treasury was besieged by multinationals who claimed they had not been consulted about the move. The chief executive of Vodafone, Chris Gent, issued a veiled threat to move Britain's biggest company to a more lax fiscal jurisdiction, such as Ireland. Ms Barker said large firms would be disappointed that the government had delayed implementation of the plan. \u0095 On Monday, the government will issue a further set of proposals for competitive reform of Europe's markets ahead of the Stockholm summit of finance ministers. The government's aim is understood to be harmonisation in Europe.

With hindsight that sounds a bit like a man declaring undying devotion for someone with a ticket to The Mousetrap. John Osborne's play owes more to Agatha Christie than to modern theatre. </p> <p>But if you lower your expectations by dissociating the play from its performance history, ignoring its place in the drama textbooks and treating Jimmy Porter as a person rather than an icon, it is possible to have a reasonably good evening at the theatre. If nothing else, Gareth Machin's production reminds us what a good potboiler this play is: the tensions, twists and turns of the plotting actually make an audience gasp if they are unfamiliar with the text. Gasping isn't a sound you hear often in the theatre nowadays. </p> <p>The play is also as marvellous a portrait of a marriage as, say, Ibsen's A Doll's House, to which it owes so much with its squirrels and bears motif. Machin's production begins by capturing this well. Right from the start the dingy attic, where Jimmy and his friend Cliff (Mark Meadows, vigorously good) are reading the Sunday papers and Jimmy's wife, Alison, is ironing, crackles with unspoken tension. There is, in the vocabulary of the 1950s, \"an atmosphere\". It is the atmosphere of dead Sundays and a marriage dying on its feet. </p> <p>But the portrait of the marriage only works if both sides are equally matched. Osborne ensures that both Jimmy and Alison are armed to the hilt and he keeps the balance of sympathies constantly shifting. But the actors have to do their bit. The play cannot work if the protagonists are not on an even footing. This is a bloody battle, not a walkover. </p> <p>But the casting here means there is no battle, just a washout. Helen Franklin's Alison has a quiet, matter-of-fact power but, while Nick Moran may have proved his street cred with the success of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, he has absolutely no charisma as Jimmy Porter. In fact he has almost no stage presence at all. Apart from the accent, which is spot on, everything about Moran's performance is superficial, from his reedy, nasal voice, which frequently sounds camp, to the lack of expression on his smooth, strangely untroubled brow. The ironing board exhibits more animation and elicits considerably more sympathy. Look Back in Anger is only great drama when you love and hate Jimmy with the same passion with which he loves and hates the world and all around him.

He had wanted to see an 8p cut and said the public would see through the government's plans.</p> <p>Environmental groups accused the chancellor of pandering to truckers and the motorist lobby. They said the measures undermined Tony Blair's green speech on Tuesday when he said he wanted Britain to be a world environmental leader.</p> <p>\"These fuel price reductions will encourage more car use, increase congestion and pollution, and make the problem of climate change even worse,\" Friends of the Earth said. \"Transport is the fastest growing source of CO2 emissions, the main climate changing gas.\" The National Society for Clean Air believed the introduction of ULSP would reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by around 5%, but the overall impact on British air quality would be \"so small as to be unmeasurable\", spokesman Tim Brown said.</p> <p>He added that cutting fuel duty, coupled with the shifting of the threshold for small car excise duty from 1200cc to 1500cc would reduce the incentive to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles and would probably increase CO2 emissions. \"It reinforces the view that the motivation for cutting petrol duty is political, not environmental.\"</p> <p>Transport 2000 accused the government of producing \"a budget for truckers\".

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday gave away \u00a31.7bn of tax cuts to the road lobby in a move which pleased motoring groups but failed to appease hardline fuel campaigners and infuriated the green lobby. More than \u00a31bn was spent on fuel tax reductions overall, with 2p per litre knocked off the price of ultra-low sulphur petrol (ULSP) and 3p taken off the equivalent kind of diesel. Leading oil companies, such as BP, promised to pass on all fuel tax breaks with effect from 6pm last night when the government action took effect. More than \u00a3400m was spent on cutting the rates of vehicle excise duty on private cars and light vehicles of under 1.5 litres while \u00a3105m went on reforming the truck licensing system. The AA motoring organisation said it was \"extremely pleased\" with the changes although it did not rule out the need for a review of the road tax system. The RAC's executive director Edmund King said: \"Chancellors normally act like modern highwaymen at budget time but this time Flash Gordon has given something back.\" Mr King said cutting the level of fuel tax would help the government start to regain the confidence of motorists, but would still leave drivers vulnerable to world petrol prices. Brynle Williams, one of the fuel protest leaders described the fuel reductions as a sham. He had wanted to see an 8p cut and said the public would see through the government's plans. Environmental groups accused the chancellor of pandering to truckers and the motorist lobby. They said the measures undermined Tony Blair's green speech on Tuesday when he said he wanted Britain to be a world environmental leader. \"These fuel price reductions will encourage more car use, increase congestion and pollution, and make the problem of climate change even worse,\" Friends of the Earth said. \"Transport is the fastest growing source of CO2 emissions, the main climate changing gas.\" The National Society for Clean Air believed the introduction of ULSP would reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by around 5%, but the overall impact on British air quality would be \"so small as to be unmeasurable\", spokesman Tim Brown said. He added that cutting fuel duty, coupled with the shifting of the threshold for small car excise duty from 1200cc to 1500cc would reduce the incentive to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles and would probably increase CO2 emissions. \"It reinforces the view that the motivation for cutting petrol duty is political, not environmental.\" Transport 2000 accused the government of producing \"a budget for truckers\". Director Stephen Joseph said the government's own research showed that a single lorry can cause up to \u00a328,000 damage to the environment and road system each year. \"Once these costs are included, the biggest lorries are under-taxed by around \u00a330,000 a year. The chancellor has increased these lorry subsidies by over 10%. Instead of giving way to truckers, we need radical reform of lorry taxes, so the biggest lorries - foreign as well as British - travelling the farthest pay the most tax.\" But environmental groups welcomed the 6p per kilogram incentives for road fuel gases and 20% duty cut for biodiesel.
