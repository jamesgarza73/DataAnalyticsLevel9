Collymore's indiscretion was committed while still a Leicester player but it is beleaguered Bradford and their new manager Jim Jefferies who will lose the maverick's services over the Christmas holiday. The Premiership's basement club have seen little first-team action from Collymore after gambling on his tempestuous talents last month.

Collymore was charged by the FA after appearing to stamp on Gascoigne, as well as using his elbow, in their clash during Leicester's game with Everton at Filbert Street on September 24.

Gallagher has not mentioned the tunnel incidents in his report and there have been no official complaints about the O'Leary-Pires row. Terry Venables will meet Middlesbrough's chairman Steve Gibson today to deliver his answer to the Teesside club's plea to the former England coach for help. It is believed that major problems may arise over the length of contract being offered and the exact role Venables would play. Venables said last night: \"The first people I will talk to are Middlesbrough.\" He would not comment about Bryan Robson's position and his reported willingness to step down as manager. Robbie Keane has reacted to mounting speculation that he is about to make a cut-price return to England by insisting that he wants to fight for his place at Internazionale. Reggina have offered the \u00a313m forward a loan move when the transfer window opens in January, and Leeds have been linked with a \u00a310m transfer. \"There is no way I want to leave Italy, especially after such a short time,\" said Keane. \"I knew when I came here that with competition like Ronaldo and Vieri ...

Rising from the makeshift pavilion staked against the camper top of his pickup, he moves to meet me with an idle power I envy. I see the wind has carved leathery lines into his legend-hewn face of fjords and right angles. </p> <p>In a dry, earthen voice, he asks me, \"Looking for the hot spring?\" </p> <p>\"Yeah, Agua Caliente. Am I even close?\" </p> <p>\"Sure. This is the place. Up the way a couple hundred yards.\" </p> <p>\"Amazing! I found it!\" </p> <p>He smiles, suddenly very charismatic, and shakes his head of long matty blond hair. \"How you got here on that bike is amazing.\" </p> <p>I had been pedaling and pushing through the forlorn land, roaming the foreign coast on disused roads and dirt tracks. When I was hungry or thirsty, I stopped at ranches and farms and begged the owners for water from their wells and tried to buy tortillas, eggs, goat cheese, and fruit. Every place gave me nourishment; men and women plucked grapefruits and tangerines from their family gardens, bagged food from their pantries, and accepted not one peso in return. Why, I asked them. Senor, they explained in the patient tone reserved for those convalescing, you are riding a bicycle, so you are poor. You are in the desert going nowhere, so you are crazy. Taking money from a poor and crazy man brings bad luck. All the extras, they confided, were because I wasn't a gringo. A crew of Mexican ranchers said they liked me because I was a bueno hermano-good brother-a Vietnamito, and my little Vietnam had golpea big America back in '75. But I'm American, Vietnamese American, I shouted at them. They grinned - Si, si, Senor - and grilled me a slab of beef. </p> <p>Tyle says, \"So, where are you from?\" </p> <p>\"Bay Area, California.\" </p> <p>\"No. Where are you from? Originally.\" </p> <p>I have always hated this question and resent him for asking. I hide my distaste because it is un-American. Perhaps I will lie. I often do when someone corners me. Sometimes, my prepared invention slips out before I realize it: I'm Japanese-Korean-Chinese-mixed-race Asian. No, sir, can't speak any language but good old American English. </p> <p>This time, I turn the question: \"Where do you think?\" </p> <p>\"Korea.\" </p> <p>Something about him makes me dance around the truth. I chuckle, painfully aware that \"I'm an American\" carries little weight with him. It no doubt resonates truer in his voice. </p> <p>The blond giant holds me with his green eyes, making me feel small, crooked. So I reply, \"We nips all look alike.\" </p> <p>But it isn't enough. He looks the question at me again, and, by a darkness on his face, I know I owe him. </p> <p>\"I'm from Vietnam.\" </p> <p>A flinch in the corner of his eye. He grunts, a sound deep from his diaphragm. Verdict passed. He turns his back to me and heaves into the cactus forest. </p> <p>I stand, a trespasser in his camp, hearing echoes-Chink, gook, Jap, Charlie, GO HOME, SLANT-EYES! - words that, I believe, must have razored my sister Chi down dark alleys, hounded her in the cold after she had fled home, a sixteen-year-old runaway, an illegal alien without her green card. What vicious clicking sounds did they make in her Vietnamese ears, wholly new to English? And, within their boundaries, which America did she find? </p> <p>A man once revealed something which disturbed me too much to be discounted. He said, \"Your sister died because she became too American.\" </p> <p>Later in the night, from the thick of the brush, Tyle ghosts into the orange light of my campfire. He nods at me and folds himself cross-legged before the popping flames, uncorks a fresh tequila bottle, takes a swig, and hands it to me. We sit on the ground far apart enough that with outstretched arms we still have to lean to relay the bottle. </p> <p>I grip the warm sand between my toes and loll the tart tequila on my tongue. A bottom-heavy moon teeters on the treetops. Stars balm the night. We seem content in our unspoken truce. </p> <p>When the bottle is half empty, Tyle begins to talk. At first, he talks about the soothing solitude of the Mexican desert. Life is simple here, food cheap, liquor plentiful. He earns most of his money from selling his handicrafts - bracelets, woven bands, beads, leather trinkets to tourists. When times are tough, there are always a few Mexicans who will hire him for English lessons or translations. And the border isn't too far if he needs to work up a large chunk of cash. Between the mundane details, his real life comes out obliquely. Tyle has a wife and two boys. He has been away from them nine years. I am the first Vietnamese he has seen since he fled to Mexico seven years ago. </p> <p>When four fingers of tequila slosh at the bottom of the bottle, he asks me, \"Have you been back to Vietnam?\"</p> <p> \"No. But someday I'll go back . . . to visit.\" </p> <p>Many Vietnamese Americans \"have been back.\" For some of us, by returning as tourists we prove to ourselves that we are no longer Vietnamese but Vietnamese Americans. We return, with our hearts in our throats, to taunt the Communist regime, to show through our material success that we, the once pitiful exiles, are now the victors. No longer the poverty-stricken refugees clinging to fishing boats, spilling out of cargo planes onto American soil, a mess of open-mouthed terror, wide-eyed awe, hungry and howling for salvation. Time has veiled the days when America fished us out of the ocean like drowning cockroaches and fed us and clothed us-we, the onus of their tragedy. We return and, in our personal silence, we gloat at our conquerors, who now seem like obnoxious monkeys cheating over baubles, our baggage, which mean little to us. Mostly, we return because we are lost. </p> <p>Tyle says, \"I was in Nam.\" I have guessed as much. Not knowing what to say, I nod. Vets - acquaintances and strangers - have said variations of this to me since I was a kid and didn't know what or where Nam was. The contraction was lost on a boy struggling to learn English. But the note, the way these men said it, told me it was important, someplace I ought to know. With the years, this statement took on new meanings, each flavored by the tone of the speaker. There was bitterness, and there was bewilderment. There was loss and rage and every shade of emotion in between. I heard declarations, accusations, boasts, demands, obliga-tions, challenges, and curses in the four words: I was in Nam. No matter how they said it, an ache welled up in me until an urge to make some sort of reparation slicked my palms with sweat. Some gesture of conciliation. Remorse. A word of apology. </p> <p>He must have seen me wince for he says it again, more gently. </p> <p>At that, I do something I've never done before. I bow to him like a respected colleague. It is a bow of acknowledgment, a bow of humility, the only way I can tell him I know of his loss, his sufferings. </p> <p>Looking into the fire, he says softly, \"Forgive me. Forgive me for what I have done to your people.\" </p> <p>The night buckles around me. </p> <p>\"What, Tyle?\" </p> <p>\"I'm sorry, man. I'm really sorry,\" he whispers. </p> <p>The blond giant begins to cry, a tired, sobless weeping, tears falling away untouched. My mouth forms the words, but I cannot utter them. No. No, Tyle. How can I forgive you? What have you done to my people? But who are my people? I don't know them. Are you my people? How can you be my people? All my life, I've looked at you sideways, won-dering if you were wondering if my brothers had killed your brothers in the war that made no sense except for the one act of sowing me here - my gain - in your bed, this strange rich-poor, generous-cruel land. I move through your world, a careful visitor, respectful and mindful, hoping for but not believing in the day when I become native. I am the rootless one, yet still the beneficiary of all of your and all of their sufferings. Then why, of us two, am I the savior, and you the sinner? </p> <p>\"Please forgive me.\" </p> <p>I deny him with my silence. </p> <p>His Viking face mashes up, twisting like a child's just before the first bawl. It doesn't come. Instead words cascade out, disjointed sentences, sputtering incoherence that at the initial rush sound like a drunk's ravings. Nameless faces. Places. Killings. He bleeds it out, airs it into the flames, pours it on me. And all I can do is gasp Oh, God at him over and over, knowing I will carry his secrets all my days. </p> <p>He asks my pardon yet again, his open hand outstretched to me. This time the quiet turns and I give him the absolution that is not mine to give. And, in my fraudulence, I know I have embarked on something greater than myself. </p> <p>\"When you go to Vietnam,\" he says, stating it as a fact, \"tell them about me. Tell them about my life, the way I'm living. Tell them about the family I've lost. Tell them I'm sorry.\" </p> <p>I give Tyle the most honored gift, the singular gift we Vietnamese give best, the gift into which one can cast all one's sorrow like trash into an abyss, only sometimes the abyss lies inside the giver. I give him silence.</p>",

When times are tough, there are always a few Mexicans who will hire him for English lessons or translations. And the border isn't too far if he needs to work up a large chunk of cash. Between the mundane details, his real life comes out obliquely. Tyle has a wife and two boys. He has been away from them nine years. I am the first Vietnamese he has seen since he fled to Mexico seven years ago. When four fingers of tequila slosh at the bottom of the bottle, he asks me, \"Have you been back to Vietnam?\" \"No. But someday I'll go back . . . to visit.\" Many Vietnamese Americans \"have been back.\" For some of us, by returning as tourists we prove to ourselves that we are no longer Vietnamese but Vietnamese Americans. We return, with our hearts in our throats, to taunt the Communist regime, to show through our material success that we, the once pitiful exiles, are now the victors. No longer the poverty-stricken refugees clinging to fishing boats, spilling out of cargo planes onto American soil, a mess of open-mouthed terror, wide-eyed awe, hungry and howling for salvation. Time has veiled the days when America fished us out of the ocean like drowning cockroaches and fed us and clothed us-we, the onus of their tragedy. We return and, in our personal silence, we gloat at our conquerors, who now seem like obnoxious monkeys cheating over baubles, our baggage, which mean little to us. Mostly, we return because we are lost. Tyle says, \"I was in Nam.\" I have guessed as much. Not knowing what to say, I nod. Vets - acquaintances and strangers - have said variations of this to me since I was a kid and didn't know what or where Nam was. The contraction was lost on a boy struggling to learn English. But the note, the way these men said it, told me it was important, someplace I ought to know. With the years, this statement took on new meanings, each flavored by the tone of the speaker. There was bitterness, and there was bewilderment. There was loss and rage and every shade of emotion in between. I heard declarations, accusations, boasts, demands, obliga-tions, challenges, and curses in the four words: I was in Nam. No matter how they said it, an ache welled up in me until an urge to make some sort of reparation slicked my palms with sweat. Some gesture of conciliation. Remorse. A word of apology. He must have seen me wince for he says it again, more gently. At that, I do something I've never done before. I bow to him like a respected colleague. It is a bow of acknowledgment, a bow of humility, the only way I can tell him I know of his loss, his sufferings. Looking into the fire, he says softly, \"Forgive me. Forgive me for what I have done to your people.\" The night buckles around me. \"What, Tyle?\" \"I'm sorry, man. I'm really sorry,\" he whispers. The blond giant begins to cry, a tired, sobless weeping, tears falling away untouched. My mouth forms the words, but I cannot utter them. No. No, Tyle. How can I forgive you? What have you done to my people? But who are my people? I don't know them. Are you my people? How can you be my people? All my life, I've looked at you sideways, won-dering if you were wondering if my brothers had killed your brothers in the war that made no sense except for the one act of sowing me here - my gain - in your bed, this strange rich-poor, generous-cruel land. I move through your world, a careful visitor, respectful and mindful, hoping for but not believing in the day when I become native. I am the rootless one, yet still the beneficiary of all of your and all of their sufferings. Then why, of us two, am I the savior, and you the sinner? \"Please forgive me.\" I deny him with my silence. His Viking face mashes up, twisting like a child's just before the first bawl. It doesn't come. Instead words cascade out, disjointed sentences, sputtering incoherence that at the initial rush sound like a drunk's ravings. Nameless faces. Places. Killings. He bleeds it out, airs it into the flames, pours it on me. And all I can do is gasp Oh, God at him over and over, knowing I will carry his secrets all my days. He asks my pardon yet again, his open hand outstretched to me. This time the quiet turns and I give him the absolution that is not mine to give. And, in my fraudulence, I know I have embarked on something greater than myself. \"When you go to Vietnam,\" he says, stating it as a fact, \"tell them about me. Tell them about my life, the way I'm living. Tell them about the family I've lost. Tell them I'm sorry.\" I give Tyle the most honored gift, the singular gift we Vietnamese give best, the gift into which one can cast all one's sorrow like trash into an abyss, only sometimes the abyss lies inside the giver. I give him silence.",

The business was talking and drinking - complementary human pleasures in which Malcolm took serious delight. After the last conference session of the afternoon, people would begin to gather in the bar and the circles formed. Limitless wine, writers far from home with nowhere else to go, nothing else to do: a delicious freedom was in the air, and the anticipation of a long journey into the night across unknown territory. </p> <p> Naturally, for such a social creature, the seminar was Malcolm's element. I remember the first I attended, in October 1970. I had arrived at the University of East Anglia to do the MA in literature. The other outsider was Jon Cook from Cambridge, who is now dean of studies at UEA. Malcolm was in his late 30s then, and with his piled-up hair, narrow knitted tie and lopsided grin there was something of the miscreant teddy boy about him. In his hesitant, lilting voice - so hard to place, that accent - he set out for us the course of study ahead - 19th-century comparative literature, the modern American novel, literary theory - and then led us into a general discussion about the novel. </p> <p>It was a brilliant session. Within minutes, it seemed, he had communicated a sense of adventure - the vitality of the novel as a form, its deep seriousness, its variety, the pleasures as well as the instruction in life it conveyed, its rich past and unguessable future. The general discussion began - a more formal version of the partying years ahead of us. </p> <p>Malcolm was always a good listener. He emboldened his students to feel clever. He could make the most reticent of them feel like Oscar Wilde. It was part of Malcolm's automatic generosity to laugh easily at other people's jokes. Who can forget that delighted, whinnying giggle? </p> <p>I would have denied it at the time, but I was keen to impress him. I think we were all intellectual show-offs that day. I remember parading my reading of Ortega y Gasset. Jon Cook appeared to be the world expert on Hegel. How tolerant Malcolm must have been. But he knew what he was about. We came away exhilarated, and determined to start on the huge reading list he had given us. </p> <p>There was no dedicated creative writing course at UEA in 1970. However, along with the academic work, one was permitted to submit fiction at the end of the year in place of a long essay. This was a startling innovation in those days. Three weeks after our first seminar, I gave Malcolm an essay on the American novelist, John Barth, and a carbon copy of my first short story, Conversation With a Cupboardman. We met in a pub to discuss the story. He was mostly interested in getting me to describe what I was trying to do. I didn't really know. The story seemed to have written itself. </p> <p>\"I like it,\" he said at last, unemphatically. \"It's publishable. But let's not think about that now. What are you going to write next?\" </p> <p>\"Another short story. It's about a boy anxious to lose his virginity who makes love to his younger sister.\" </p> <p>\"Can I have it by the end of the month?\" </p> <p>I handed in essays to Malcolm on Borges, Mailer, and on theories of representation, and I continued to give him stories, some of which were collected up later into my first book. It was not his style to interfere in the style, structure or content of what I did. But he knew how to motivate. </p> <p>Fiction, as I was seeing it through his eyes, was the highest calling. I continued to fulfil the academic requirements, but I only cared about the stories. Malcolm was my reading public. I wrote in the certainty that I would receive a close reading - and this was an extraordinary privilege. </p> <p>His reading list alone was changing my life. It was the Americans, above all, that he wanted us to read. The ambition, the social range, the expressive freedom of American writing made English fiction seem poky and grey. To find bold and violent colours became my imperative. Echoes of Roth and Burroughs crept into my stories. The struggle with influence, Malcolm told me once in the pub, is part of the pleasure of finding your own way. </p> <p>In the years that followed we met from time to time in whatever monastery or palace the British Council had rented for conferences. There, Malcolm's tentative, judicious style granted a licence to younger writers. He was fair, so we could be savage in our judgments. As a critic, he lacked cruelty almost to a fault. He was an instinctive celebrator, rather than destroyer, of reputations. However late it got, Malcolm would be one of the last to get to bed. What he relished was a conversation with a direction, a beat. Gossip was fine too. </p> <p>Another bottle is opened. A certain writer, someone says, no longer does interviews. Only press conferences. Publicity hunger versus reclusiveness bring us to Pynchon, until the fatwa in 1989, the world's most hunted writer. Inflated, whimsical, a world view stifled by paranoia, someone says. Malcolm hears this out, then defends; inflated, only to a certain cast of English mind - to some novelists paranoia is not a disabling mental condition, but the motor of ingenious plot making. </p> <p>By way of Melville, through Kafka, we arrive at an eminent novelist. The consensus around the table is that her sentences are no good - cliche-heavy, unrhythmic, no surprises. Therefore, she is no bloody good at all.

In the geometry of these moral schemes there's a beauty that no individual sentence can yield. </p> <p>Can a good novel be written badly? We've been around this a number of times before. And who are today's best sentence makers? Malcolm makes the case for Martin Amis, together with some exquisite examples he has by heart. Two weeks before, Martin has given Malcolm a finely executed pistol-whipping in the Observer for his novel, Rates of Exchange. The critic remains scrupulously detached from the workaday resentments of the novelist. </p> <p> Since his death, there is one encounter with Malcolm that haunts me. In the dazed hour immediately after winning the Booker Prize in 1998, I was surrounded by excited voices, and pulled from press conference to interviews, and from crowded rooms to answer questions in television trucks and radio cars. At some point I lost the Booker publicity people, or they lost me, and I stepped through a door by mistake into an empty hall. I went through another door, and found myself in a long straight ill-lit corridor. </p> <p>Coming towards me, from some distance away, were Malcolm and his wife Elizabeth.

      "body": "<p>The Welsh education minister yesterday signalled a shake-up of the secondary school league tables in Wales to provide parents with better information about the their children's achievements.</p> <p>Speaking on the eve of the publication today of the annual secondary performance tables, Jane Davidson, assembly minister for education and lifelong learning, said she would launch a consultation in the new year to establish an alternative means of assessment to the present one, which used only raw data based on exam results. She said she had an \"open mind\" about it, although headteachers were hoping that \"value added\" measures to reflect the schools' input to improving performance would be considered.</p> <p>Value added measures would bring the tables into line with their English counterparts. The government wants the measures to be a feature of all league tables across all age groups, by 2004.</p> <p>\"It is almost 10 years since the first performance tables were published,\" said Ms Davidson yesterday. \"We need to reflect on whether they are the most effective and distinctive means of putting this information in the public domain, not least because they measure performance in terms of external exam results, and do not recognise year-on-year improvement in schools.\"</p> <p>Ms Davidson said she was concerned about the way the media focused only on the best and worst performing schools, and wanted parents to get more information to help with choosing schools. In Wales, the results of primary assessments and tests are listed by local education authority rather than by school, in what is recognised as a less divisive system.</p> <p>The data published today shows further improvements by children in Wales, with 49% of pupils achieving the equivalent of at least five GCSEs at grades A*-C, compared with 48% last year - a figure edging towards the target of 54% by 2002. Of those entered for the equivalent of two or more A-levels, a greater proportion were achieving grades A-C and more gaining pass marks.</p> <p>In Wales, the state school system is genuinely more comprehensive than in England. There are no grammar schools, and no city technology colleges or specialist schools operating partial selection.</p> <p>The comprehensive school with the highest proportion of pupils getting five or more good GCSEs (86%) was Cowbridge comprehensive in the Vale of Glamorgan. Its headteacher, Joan Cowell, said: \"I welcome the fact that Jane Davidson is listening to headteachers and that she's recognised the need for change.

      "bodyText": "The Welsh education minister yesterday signalled a shake-up of the secondary school league tables in Wales to provide parents with better information about the their children's achievements. Speaking on the eve of the publication today of the annual secondary performance tables, Jane Davidson, assembly minister for education and lifelong learning, said she would launch a consultation in the new year to establish an alternative means of assessment to the present one, which used only raw data based on exam results. She said she had an \"open mind\" about it, although headteachers were hoping that \"value added\" measures to reflect the schools' input to improving performance would be considered. Value added measures would bring the tables into line with their English counterparts. The government wants the measures to be a feature of all league tables across all age groups, by 2004. \"It is almost 10 years since the first performance tables were published,\" said Ms Davidson yesterday. \"We need to reflect on whether they are the most effective and distinctive means of putting this information in the public domain, not least because they measure performance in terms of external exam results, and do not recognise year-on-year improvement in schools.\" Ms Davidson said she was concerned about the way the media focused only on the best and worst performing schools, and wanted parents to get more information to help with choosing schools. In Wales, the results of primary assessments and tests are listed by local education authority rather than by school, in what is recognised as a less divisive system. The data published today shows further improvements by children in Wales, with 49% of pupils achieving the equivalent of at least five GCSEs at grades A*-C, compared with 48% last year - a figure edging towards the target of 54% by 2002. Of those entered for the equivalent of two or more A-levels, a greater proportion were achieving grades A-C and more gaining pass marks. In Wales, the state school system is genuinely more comprehensive than in England. There are no grammar schools, and no city technology colleges or specialist schools operating partial selection. The comprehensive school with the highest proportion of pupils getting five or more good GCSEs (86%) was Cowbridge comprehensive in the Vale of Glamorgan. Its headteacher, Joan Cowell, said: \"I welcome the fact that Jane Davidson is listening to headteachers and that she's recognised the need for change. Our score of 86%, while good, actually fails to reflect the colossal improvement the school has made in value added terms.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government secured a victory in the Lords today for its compromise deal for the partial privatisation of the air traffic control system (Nats). Although the government had already secured a 97-vote victory in the Commons last night, the amendment was bounced back to the Lords for the final showdown this afternoon. The victory for the compromise deal comes after the Liberal Democrats last night joined Tory MPs in denouncing the last-minute concession to delay the Nats sale for three months as \"spin and nothing more than that\". On Monday peers, backed by three Labour rebels, voted for the sell-off to be delayed until after the general election, which is widely expected to be at the start of May. The transport minister, Lord Macdonald, swiftly offered a concession which would see the transport bill - with its crucial plans to revive the railways and introduce congestion charging in cities - become law by the end of this week but the Nats sale delayed for three months. Labour's Gwyneth Dunwoody, the chairman of the Commons transport select committee, last night warned that the government was \"made up of ordinary people who make mistakes and the partial privatisation of Nats is a mistake.\" Sources close to the bid have revealed that one of the main bidding companies is proposing to replace 70% of the engineering staff with contract staff, it emerged today. The facilities management and support services company, Serco, is planning to sub-contract much of its engineering maintenance work, in much the same way as Railtrack. This could affect almost 1,000 of Nats engineering staff, who are strongly opposed to the move on safety grounds, as well as because of the threat to their jobs. Senior Nats staff have already threatened to resign if the bid goes ahead. They say that Serco is the least suited to the job, although it is known that it is one favoured by the government. Iain Findlay, national officer of the air traffic controllers' union, IPMS, said: \"This would lead to a total collapse of the Nats safety system because there would be no control over the quality of work being done by sub-contractors. It would be a repetition of what has happened at Railtrack.\" Interactive Talk about it: Should the government sell off Britain's air traffic control?

Alas, his blunt response told us only one thing - those Italian lessons haven't started yet. But today, inevitably, things did get worse. Much worse. Chelsea began the morning by confirming what most tabloids had already \"exclusively\" revealed - that Ray Wilkins and Graham Rix had been fired by Claudio Ranieri, supposedly for creating divisions in the camp and hindering team spirit. But predictably it wasn't long before Ken Bates's arch-enforcer - okay, Chelsea managing director - Colin Hutchinson popped up with an altogether rosier explanation.</p> <p> \"The situation is relatively simple but also sad,\" said a surprisingly tender Hutch, holding back a tear. \"Ray Wilkins and Graham Rix left us yesterday.\" Then, after dabbing at his bloodshot eye with a black handkerchief, he continued: \"I think it was inevitable and in fact people at the training ground have said to me in hindsight that it should have been done from day one.\" And that wasn't the end of The Hutch's histrionics. \"Whatever some people might think, we try to be a caring club and we, as well as Claudio, wanted them to be integrated as part of the new set-up,\" he insisted, before the grief (or is that the guilt?) finally overcame him and he collapsed into the arms of reporters.</p> <p>But Chelsea's image as a \"caring club\" took an immediate taxi-like battering when Christian Panucci started talking to an Italian website this afternoon. \"I can't wait to leave Chelsea,\" he told calciomercato.com. \"I am in a situation where I can't wait any longer to go back.\" Panucci then went on to deny a report in Tuttosport about him having talks with Lazio's directors. \"Unfortunately, it's not true,\" he dolefully admitted. \"I hope they come though, I want to go back to Italy.\" To which the Fiver says: \"It's all very well you venting your spleen, Christian, but can't you see there's a queue?\"</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>KARPIN ON</strong></p> <p>Tired of not having enough Romanians in your team?

Well, help is at hand, courtesy of the Spanish legal system. Only months after doing their best to give that Pinochet what for, the Spanish courts have ruled that Valeri Karpin, a Russian international who plays for Celta Vigo and has a fantastic flick haircut, is now a fully paid-up member of the EU. Which means he can play for Celta every week, and also that we could have another Bosman on our hands.</p> <p>Karpin took various Spanish sporting bodies to court after he was fed up of being one of Celta's five non-EU players, only three of whom could ever play in the team at one time. The court ruled in his favour because Russia is one of five EU affiliate countries (the others being Romania, Croatia, Turkey, Slovenia, Yorkshire, and Essex) which is basically close enough for the Spaniards. The ruling currently only affects Karpin himself, but the 30-year-old said today: \"The will be good for the league but bad for Spanish players\", adding, \"I took this decision because it benefited me, but I never thought I'd be a pioneer.\"</p> <p>And the Fiver never thought it would write about someone called Valeri. Anyway, the important thing to realise is that Karpin's ruling does not directly affect the Premiership yet, and has left the FA so unbothered that when the Fiver asked them what the consequences could be for our game, they told us to talk to Uefa.

      "body": "<p><strong>What is the medical practices committee (MPC)?</strong><br> The MPC manages the distribution of GPs across England and Wales, attempting to ensure that family doctors are evenly and fairly spread across England and Wales. It was set up in 1946 to tackle wide variations in access to GPs, who had tended to congregate in wealthier areas (where they could earn a good living) rather than deprived areas (where health needs were arguably more acute).</p> <p><strong>Has it succeeded? </strong><br> On its own terms, it probably has. Using its powers to refuse applications from doctors who wish to practice in \"over-doctored\" areas, it has gradually widened the spread of GP coverage. By 1986 there were no longer any areas of England and Wales classified as having \"insufficient doctors\" or average list sizes (numbers of patients per GP) of more than 2,500. The decline in list sizes is partly due to an increase in practicing GPs; but the national average list size has continued to fall during the past 10 years, even though the number of full-time GPs has remained fairly constant.</p> <p><strong>So why do ministers want to abolish the MPC?</strong><br> The government feels that the MPC has been only a \"partial success\". It is concerned that while national figures may look good in theory, in practice there are still areas of the country that are hopelessly \"under-doctored\" - mainly deprived Labour heartlands such as inner-city Sunderland, East London and former mining communities around Barnsley.</p> <p><strong>Is it fair to blame the MPC?</strong><br> It is certainly a convenient scapegoat. But the MPC has never had powers to appoint GPs or force them to work in certain areas. It can determine areas where additional doctors are needed, and prevent doctors from setting up in those areas where they are not needed. It argues that it has regularly approved applications from under-doctored areas to appoint more GPs. So it can't be blamed if a health authority, at a time when GPs are scarce, fails to attract any takers for the job.</p> <p><strong>What will replace the MPC?</strong><br> According to the NHS plan, the MPC will be superceded by \"a single resource allocation formula covering all NHS spending including general medical services non-cash limited expenditure\". This effectively means each health authority will be given responsibility for working out how many GPs it needs and where, as well as the cash to attract extra family doctors if it decides it has a shortage. This will be monitored nationally by the Medical Education Standards Board.</p> <p><strong>Will this work?</strong><br> Technically, it will allow health authorities with shortages of doctors the freedom to be imaginative in the ways they attract GPs - mainly by offering them handsome financial and \"'quality of life\" inducements. But GPs cannot be compelled to work anywhere, and there is no guarantee that authorities in more salubrious areas - the shire counties for example - will not use their freedoms to attract the increasingly dwindling GP workforce to come and work in their area.</p> <p><strong>How does the MPC decide how many GPs an area should have?</strong><br> It looks at patient list sizes, and analyzes the many factors in a given locality which influence GP workload - namely deprivation, numbers of temporary residents, numbers of elderly patients, levels of out-of-hours work and numbers of drug abusers. In this way it said it is able to assess the relative need for GPs between health authorities.</p> <p><strong>Can't health authorities do this for themselves</strong><br> The MPC said authority resources are already stretched, and lack the financial resources and expertise to do proper assessments of their needs. It said this will lead to fragmentation, disparities between health authority assessments, inequalities in access to primary care, and \"inter and intra-HA battles\" to attract scarce GPs - an \"open market\" in family doctors.</p> <p><strong>Didn't Labour promise to abolish markets and competition from the health service?</strong><br> Yes. It also promised to replace the chaotic free-for-all of the Tories internal NHS market with more a structured, planned approach to providing care. A \"one nation\" NHS in fact. \"It's ironic,\" said MPC chairman Ro Day, \"Ministers don't seem to have thought this one through.\"</p> <p><strong>At the end of all this will the likes of Barnsley have more GPs and smaller list sizes?</strong><br> It is difficult to say. The shortage of GPs is likely to get worse before it gets better, making it a seller's market. Unless Barnsley can provide prospective GPs with the sort of wallet-bulging inducements that will persuade them to give up their ambition to work in a cosy practice next to a golf club in Surrey or a marina in Hampshire, Barnsley could be out of luck, with or without the MPC.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What is the medical practices committee (MPC)? The MPC manages the distribution of GPs across England and Wales, attempting to ensure that family doctors are evenly and fairly spread across England and Wales. It was set up in 1946 to tackle wide variations in access to GPs, who had tended to congregate in wealthier areas (where they could earn a good living) rather than deprived areas (where health needs were arguably more acute). Has it succeeded? On its own terms, it probably has. Using its powers to refuse applications from doctors who wish to practice in \"over-doctored\" areas, it has gradually widened the spread of GP coverage. By 1986 there were no longer any areas of England and Wales classified as having \"insufficient doctors\" or average list sizes (numbers of patients per GP) of more than 2,500. The decline in list sizes is partly due to an increase in practicing GPs; but the national average list size has continued to fall during the past 10 years, even though the number of full-time GPs has remained fairly constant. So why do ministers want to abolish the MPC? The government feels that the MPC has been only a \"partial success\". It is concerned that while national figures may look good in theory, in practice there are still areas of the country that are hopelessly \"under-doctored\" - mainly deprived Labour heartlands such as inner-city Sunderland, East London and former mining communities around Barnsley. Is it fair to blame the MPC? It is certainly a convenient scapegoat. But the MPC has never had powers to appoint GPs or force them to work in certain areas. It can determine areas where additional doctors are needed, and prevent doctors from setting up in those areas where they are not needed. It argues that it has regularly approved applications from under-doctored areas to appoint more GPs. So it can't be blamed if a health authority, at a time when GPs are scarce, fails to attract any takers for the job. What will replace the MPC? According to the NHS plan, the MPC will be superceded by \"a single resource allocation formula covering all NHS spending including general medical services non-cash limited expenditure\". This effectively means each health authority will be given responsibility for working out how many GPs it needs and where, as well as the cash to attract extra family doctors if it decides it has a shortage. This will be monitored nationally by the Medical Education Standards Board. Will this work? Technically, it will allow health authorities with shortages of doctors the freedom to be imaginative in the ways they attract GPs - mainly by offering them handsome financial and \"'quality of life\" inducements. But GPs cannot be compelled to work anywhere, and there is no guarantee that authorities in more salubrious areas - the shire counties for example - will not use their freedoms to attract the increasingly dwindling GP workforce to come and work in their area. How does the MPC decide how many GPs an area should have? It looks at patient list sizes, and analyzes the many factors in a given locality which influence GP workload - namely deprivation, numbers of temporary residents, numbers of elderly patients, levels of out-of-hours work and numbers of drug abusers. In this way it said it is able to assess the relative need for GPs between health authorities. Can't health authorities do this for themselves The MPC said authority resources are already stretched, and lack the financial resources and expertise to do proper assessments of their needs. It said this will lead to fragmentation, disparities between health authority assessments, inequalities in access to primary care, and \"inter and intra-HA battles\" to attract scarce GPs - an \"open market\" in family doctors. Didn't Labour promise to abolish markets and competition from the health service? Yes. It also promised to replace the chaotic free-for-all of the Tories internal NHS market with more a structured, planned approach to providing care. A \"one nation\" NHS in fact. \"It's ironic,\" said MPC chairman Ro Day, \"Ministers don't seem to have thought this one through.\" At the end of all this will the likes of Barnsley have more GPs and smaller list sizes? It is difficult to say. The shortage of GPs is likely to get worse before it gets better, making it a seller's market. Unless Barnsley can provide prospective GPs with the sort of wallet-bulging inducements that will persuade them to give up their ambition to work in a cosy practice next to a golf club in Surrey or a marina in Hampshire, Barnsley could be out of luck, with or without the MPC.",

      "bodyText": "The hard-line Israeli opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, said today that he was still open to holding coalition talks with the prime minister, Ehud Barak, following yesterday's overwhelming parliament vote to hold elections two years ahead of schedule. Mr Sharon said he would talk about a coalition at Mr Barak's invitation, but the prospect of this appears slight as the prime minister rejected the broad idea yesterday. But today Mr Sharon said he would still consider joining the government if he was given veto powers over Mr Barak's peace efforts - something the prime minister has said he is unwilling to do. Mr Barak agreed yesterday to hold an early vote in a surprise move to take the initiative from the more hawkish opposition. However, amid the political manoeuvres, Israeli-Palestinian violence persisted. An Israeli motorist was critically wounded in a West Bank shooting ambush today. And in the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers fired on Palestinians trying to cut through a border fence. The army said there were fatalities, but that it did not know how many. But Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian negotiator, said he was still hopeful a peace accord can be reached before the Israeli elections and despite two months of violence that have killed more than 280 people, most of them Palestinians. In recent days there has been a lull in violence, attributed to the holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from dawn to dusk, and to cool, rainy weather. Representatives of Mr Barak's One Israel alignment and the opposition Likud party, which Mr Sharon leads, met briefly today to try to agree on a date for elections. Mr Sharon said elections should be held as quickly as possible and \"even before Passover,\" the Jewish holiday that begins April 7. One Israel did not propose an election date, but planned to do so on Monday, according to a party spokesman, Gilad Haymann. Reaching a peace agreement with the Palestinians in the next few months is widely seen as Mr Barak's only chance to get re-elected. The Israeli foreign minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, suggested that elections could serve as a referendum on a peace deal. He said: \"If we reach an agreement - we are facing general elections - the people will judge it,\" he said on Israel army radio. \"They can decide that they don't want it.\" Polls have indicated that without an agreement in hand, Mr Barak would be narrowly defeated by Mr Sharon and trounced by the former prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

All the artists here work in Britain. We don't just export the YBA generation. The cultural life of Britain is immeasurably strengthened by those from abroad who have chosen to work here.

      "body": "<p><strong>Book of the month </strong><br><strong>The Other Side of Truth </strong> by Beverley Naidoo<br> (Puffin, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) <br> Anyone who regularly reads new children's fiction could be forgiven for thinking that nobody publishes books for the over-eights any more unless they feature wizards and magic \u00e0 la Harry Potter. Do publishers doubt that children are interested in the real world? Are we creating generations who see fiction only as escapism? So it's good to see a book that deals with the here and now and an issue that has been much in the news: asylum seekers. </p> <p>Naidoo's powerful, gripping novel that would be perfect for the over-10s, is set in the wake of the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa in Nigeria. Sade and Femi, the children of an outspoken Nigerian journalist, find their lives in danger after their father criticises the government. The family decides to flee Nigeria for Britain. But Britain doesn't turn out to be the safe haven that they had envisaged. </p> <p>This is a tough, realistic, sharply written book that gives a window on a world that is far removed from most British children's lives. With luck, it will make them swell with indignation and a determination to fight for justice. </p> <p><strong> Ages 0-3</strong><br> <strong>Who Am I? </strong>by Aurelie Lanchais and Alain Crozon<br> (Milet, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) <br> Q: \"I make a milk that is milky and white and helps you sleep tight. Who am I?\" <br>A: A cow.<br> Q: \"My tears look sad, but my teeth are happy to be snappy. Who am I?\" <br>A: A crocodile. </p> <p>If you thought the lift-and-flap book has already done everything possible, this brilliantly original series of brightly-coloured books will change your mind. The concept is simplicity itself: a riddle-like question, a visual clue and a bright picture answer with a line of text. But the execution is totally engaging. Everything about this series is well thought-out. Check out the other three books: What Am I?; I Have Wheels, What Am I? and I Can Fly, What Am I? </p> <p><strong>Go Away, Big Green Monster</strong> by Ed Emberley <br>(Walker, \u00a37.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) <br> There is tons of giggly, gurning fun to be had with this peephole book that allows its young readers to confront their worst fears by creating a gaily-coloured monster face and then banishing it again by turning the pages so that each feature gradually disappears. It puts the child firmly in control, making fun of the monster and having the power to banish it. You can even put your fingers inside the monster's mouth and tickle its teeth. </p> <p>Clean, bright graphics ensure that this ingeniously simple book is very user-friendly. It would work well in different ways for different kinds of children, but is likely to cause fits of giggles in even the most anxiety-ridden toddler. </p> <p><strong> Ages 4-7</strong><br> <strong>Crispin: the Pig Who Had It All by Ted Dewan</strong><br> (Doubleday, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99) <br> Crispin is a pig who has everything money can buy. Every Christmas is a riot of hi-tech toys that end up broken by New Year's Day. Then one Christmas, Santa leaves him an enormous box with a message: \"In this box, you will find the only thing you do not have. It's the very best thing in the whole wide world.\" The box is completely empty. Crispin is sad, but it's not long before he discovers that Santa is right. </p> <p>This is a gorgeous, non-preachy morality tale for kids who have everything. Dewan's story may be obvious to adults, but it has enough twists to keep children delighted, and the illustrations are lovely too. </p> <p><strong>The Last Polar Bears</strong> by Harry Horse<br>(Viking, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99) <br> A new picture book that serves as a good introduction to that singular dog Roo, who accompanies Grandfather on his mad journeys around the world. Picture books still play a bigger role than parents sometimes realise at this age, and children who enjoy the screwy humour of this will happily graduate to Horse's more text-heavy Puffin editions that follow Roo and Grandfather's exploits. </p> <p>This story has Roo and Grandfather deciding that the zoo provides no life for a bear; so they set off ito the North Pole to find out how Polar bears really live. It is a mad-cap, ice cream-fuelled adventure told with a quirky, off-beat humour. It's \"anything is possible\" approach to life is charming, wonderfully infectious and a bit of a fillip in these conformist times. </p> <p><strong> Ages 8-11</strong><br> <strong>The Rope and Other Stories</strong> by Philippa Pearce<br> (Puffin, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) <br> They don't write them like this any more. Philippa Pearce, author of Tom's Midnight Garden, confirms herself as a national treasure with this collection of stories, some new and some written more than 20 years ago. Some are slightly old-fashioned, but the writing is always understated yet exquisite, and no writer captures the dreamy intensity of childhood better. </p> <p>Even the most streetwise, hi-tech youngster will fall for the quiet charm of these tales, recognising themselves in the fears of Mike who, in the title story, feels obliged to prove himself on the swing rope over the river, or enjoying the insights into the odd minds of grown-ups in stories such as \"Nutmeg\". </p> <p><strong>Shadow of the Minotaur</strong> by Alan Gibbons<br> (Dolphin, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99 <br> Phoenix's dad is a computer geek who has moved his unwilling family to a new town to do a job as a creator of computer games for a mysterious company. Phoenix is having a bad time at his new school, things are tense at home, so he takes solace in a new game based on Greek myths that his dad is involved in making. </p> <p>But as Phoenix and his dad soon discover, someone has been tinkering with the software. You can't play it, it plays you: virtual reality becomes terrifyingly real as Phoenix is transformed into Theseus who must fight the Minotaur. </p> <p>Girls will find this unputdownable, but if you've got a boy who is a reluctant reader then this is guaranteed to make him change his mind. Gibbons is a teacher and knows how to hook a child's interest. </p> <p><strong> Ages 12+</strong><br> <strong>In Flame</strong> by Gaye Hicyilmaz<br> (Faber, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) <br> The past comes back to haunt 14-year-old Helen when, seven years after the death of her beloved brother Tom, her family move to the Pembroke coast where they used to spend their summer holidays. But instead of a new start, Helen finds herself drawn into a web of tangled relationships. Her younger brother seems constantly frightened, her mother is obsessed with a young man called Christian and Helen feels attracted towards him herself. Then there is Christian's sister, who has recollections of Tom that are highly unsettling. </p> <p>Hicyilmaz's immensely satisfying novel scores in every way. The writing is delicate and pointed, the plotting exciting and the characters psychologically convincing. </p> <p><strong>Where Were You, Robert?</strong> by Hans Magnus Enzensberger <br>(Hamish Hamilton, \u00a314.99; CultureShop price \u00a311.99) <br> It is a question that almost every parent with a dreamy teenager with distant eyes has asked their offspring at one time or another. But, in the case of Robert, it is a pertinent question because when he looks into a picture or a recreation of the past, he falls through time and history. Robert knows firsthand what it is like to talk to his own grandmother when she was a little girl or discover the secrets of a 17th-century painter's studio. Terribly useful for all those school projects, you imagine. </p> <p>This is a spellbinding, cleverly constructed book, in which the past is brought vividly to life. Part of the adventure is in discovering how Robert will get himself back to his own time. </p> <p>\u0095 Call CultureShop on 0800 3166 102 or send your order with a UK cheque payable to The Guardian CultureShop to: Off the Shelf Offer, CultureShop Freepost, LON3590, London, W3 6BR.

Go Away, Big Green Monster by Ed Emberley (Walker, \u00a37.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) There is tons of giggly, gurning fun to be had with this peephole book that allows its young readers to confront their worst fears by creating a gaily-coloured monster face and then banishing it again by turning the pages so that each feature gradually disappears. It puts the child firmly in control, making fun of the monster and having the power to banish it. You can even put your fingers inside the monster's mouth and tickle its teeth. Clean, bright graphics ensure that this ingeniously simple book is very user-friendly. It would work well in different ways for different kinds of children, but is likely to cause fits of giggles in even the most anxiety-ridden toddler. Ages 4-7 Crispin: the Pig Who Had It All by Ted Dewan (Doubleday, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99) Crispin is a pig who has everything money can buy. Every Christmas is a riot of hi-tech toys that end up broken by New Year's Day. Then one Christmas, Santa leaves him an enormous box with a message: \"In this box, you will find the only thing you do not have. It's the very best thing in the whole wide world.\" The box is completely empty. Crispin is sad, but it's not long before he discovers that Santa is right. This is a gorgeous, non-preachy morality tale for kids who have everything. Dewan's story may be obvious to adults, but it has enough twists to keep children delighted, and the illustrations are lovely too. The Last Polar Bears by Harry Horse (Viking, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99) A new picture book that serves as a good introduction to that singular dog Roo, who accompanies Grandfather on his mad journeys around the world. Picture books still play a bigger role than parents sometimes realise at this age, and children who enjoy the screwy humour of this will happily graduate to Horse's more text-heavy Puffin editions that follow Roo and Grandfather's exploits. This story has Roo and Grandfather deciding that the zoo provides no life for a bear; so they set off ito the North Pole to find out how Polar bears really live. It is a mad-cap, ice cream-fuelled adventure told with a quirky, off-beat humour. It's \"anything is possible\" approach to life is charming, wonderfully infectious and a bit of a fillip in these conformist times. Ages 8-11 The Rope and Other Stories by Philippa Pearce (Puffin, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) They don't write them like this any more. Philippa Pearce, author of Tom's Midnight Garden, confirms herself as a national treasure with this collection of stories, some new and some written more than 20 years ago. Some are slightly old-fashioned, but the writing is always understated yet exquisite, and no writer captures the dreamy intensity of childhood better. Even the most streetwise, hi-tech youngster will fall for the quiet charm of these tales, recognising themselves in the fears of Mike who, in the title story, feels obliged to prove himself on the swing rope over the river, or enjoying the insights into the odd minds of grown-ups in stories such as \"Nutmeg\". Shadow of the Minotaur by Alan Gibbons (Dolphin, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99 Phoenix's dad is a computer geek who has moved his unwilling family to a new town to do a job as a creator of computer games for a mysterious company. Phoenix is having a bad time at his new school, things are tense at home, so he takes solace in a new game based on Greek myths that his dad is involved in making. But as Phoenix and his dad soon discover, someone has been tinkering with the software. You can't play it, it plays you: virtual reality becomes terrifyingly real as Phoenix is transformed into Theseus who must fight the Minotaur. Girls will find this unputdownable, but if you've got a boy who is a reluctant reader then this is guaranteed to make him change his mind. Gibbons is a teacher and knows how to hook a child's interest. Ages 12+ In Flame by Gaye Hicyilmaz (Faber, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) The past comes back to haunt 14-year-old Helen when, seven years after the death of her beloved brother Tom, her family move to the Pembroke coast where they used to spend their summer holidays. But instead of a new start, Helen finds herself drawn into a web of tangled relationships. Her younger brother seems constantly frightened, her mother is obsessed with a young man called Christian and Helen feels attracted towards him herself. Then there is Christian's sister, who has recollections of Tom that are highly unsettling. Hicyilmaz's immensely satisfying novel scores in every way. The writing is delicate and pointed, the plotting exciting and the characters psychologically convincing. Where Were You, Robert? by Hans Magnus Enzensberger (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a314.99; CultureShop price \u00a311.99) It is a question that almost every parent with a dreamy teenager with distant eyes has asked their offspring at one time or another. But, in the case of Robert, it is a pertinent question because when he looks into a picture or a recreation of the past, he falls through time and history. Robert knows firsthand what it is like to talk to his own grandmother when she was a little girl or discover the secrets of a 17th-century painter's studio. Terribly useful for all those school projects, you imagine. This is a spellbinding, cleverly constructed book, in which the past is brought vividly to life. Part of the adventure is in discovering how Robert will get himself back to his own time. \u0095 Call CultureShop on 0800 3166 102 or send your order with a UK cheque payable to The Guardian CultureShop to: Off the Shelf Offer, CultureShop Freepost, LON3590, London, W3 6BR.

      "body": "<p>I am scared to open a newspaper today. You see, my mother's new book is about to be published and she's written a piece for a national newspaper. In it, she tells how she discovered, at the age of 24, that the man she thought was her father, was not. She asked whether I minded her printing such a personal story. I didn't. After all, it's not about me - for once. The problem is that then the paper asked for a photograph of my mum, dad and I, which she knows I would hate. She promises she didn't send one. Now I can't bear to look: you see, it wouldn't be the first time my mother has embarrassed me in print. It's happened throughout my life - even before I was born. </p> <p>My mum, Val Hudson, used to write a column for the Sun in which she told readers of the trouble she was having conceiving me: \"I'm The Girl The Stork Forgot!\" screamed the headline. Her readers sent in bizarre baby-making tips by the sackful. Cue the column: \"There are 101 ways to make a baby and I've tried them all!\" Imagine your mum having sex in 101 different ways. </p> <p>Months later, when the stork finally did visit, my mum celebrated by allowing the Sun to print my first scan picture, and Pebble Mill At One to follow her pregnancy. During this warts-and-all series, a geneticist produced a photograph of what I might look like: a baby with the face of a werewolf, my dad's long arms and mum's short legs. \"Her knuckles will scrape the ground... is it too late for an abortion?\" Val joked. </p> <p>In the end, Val had a glamorous labour: she wore enormous false eyelashes (testing them for a magazine under strenuous conditions). They lasted well and didn't even need replacing for the photoshoot in her hospital room the next day. </p> <p>Fast-forward 13 years: mum was the producer of a BBC afternoon magazine programme called Bazaar. She needed a teenager to appear on a segment about customising old T-shirts to save money and asked me to do it. \"It'll be fun,\" she promised. Naively, I believed her. </p> <p>It was only when I discovered that my partner in (fashion) crime was Andi Peters that I realised it definitely wasn't going to be fun. But nothing could have prepared me for the horror of what was to come. I thought we'd finished filming when the director asked me put the T-shirt on for a few close-ups. I stood wearing the purple, beaded monstrosity Andi and I had created while everyone stared at me. I was in my most awkward, sulky phase of adolescence: all bad hair (gel, mousse and spray) and spots. </p> <p>Then it happened. Madonna's Vogue blared out, the cameras started rolling and the director pointed at me and said: \"OK, dance!\" It was possibly the most hideous moment of my life. </p> <p>Then mum moved into writing novels, using my dad's surname of Corbett. They were sensational, glitzy stories. When I saw that the tagline for her third book, Double Trouble, was \"Mother and daughter compete for fame, money and men!\", I knew I was in trouble. \"Darling, you'll have to help me promote the book, a few magazines are doing stories.\" I reluctantly agreed to do one piece. </p> <p>Cosmopolitan sent a car to drive me to a gym. I had my hair and make-up done, and then the art director announced what she wanted us to do. We were going to be photographed in a boxing ring. Wearing boxing gloves. Pretending to hit each other. How I restrained myself from knocking my mother out remains a mystery. </p> <p>A few weeks later mum rang me, breathless with excitement. We had been asked to go on Esther Rantzen's talk show. I was adamant in my refusal but mum still managed to persuade me. She offered \u00a3100. I was young, I needed the money. Mum had promised that they were going to put me in the audience and only ask me one question. She promised. </p> <p>I should have known. Mum had said to arrive fresh-faced at the studio as my make-up would be done there. So I came straight from work but got caught in early-evening traffic and arrived nearly an hour late. As I walked into the building, the producer grabbed me and screamed: \"Thank God you're here at last!\" She whisked me along maze-like corridors, through the make-up room (\"No time to stop, sadly\"), into the studio and on to the stage. The whole show was about us. I sat down, confused, barefaced, with wild hair and a wilder expression in my eyes as the floor manager said, \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and go!\", and Emma Forbes (Esther was ill) started the show. </p> <p>\"You die for this,\" I whispered to mum without moving my lips. </p> <p>\"I swear I didn't know until we got here,\" she lied through her teeth. </p> <p>That was three years ago and I can laugh about it now. Just about. </p> <p>This may seem like a cruel story of child exploitation to further a career, but I now realise it isn't. When you're a writer, you are inspired by the people closest to you. That's not to say I haven't been angry with my mum over the years - we've had some blazing rows about all this and we'll probably have another one when I finally pluck up the courage to open the paper.

It is not uncommon for schools in this part of south-east London to have security guards patrolling their playgrounds and CCTV cameras monitoring their corridors. </p> <p>But however accustomed these schoolchildren may have become to violence, nothing could have prepared them for the news that the blood of a 10-year-old had been spilt on these same streets. \"He was just a tiny kid,\" says Ellen, 13, tears welling in her eyes as she stares towards Oliver Goldsmith primary school. </p> <p>It is, of course, far too early to speculate about what led to the stabbing of Damilola Taylor as he was returning from the primary school's computer club to his council flat on the nearby North Peckham estate. His body was found just outside a social services office building where the Southwark's youth offending team is based. </p> <p>Whatever led to Damilola's death, the killing must surely draw attention to what is happening to all the children of Peckham, and other parts of inner-city London. For Damilola's killing took place against a burgeoning subculture of youth violence which has been taking root, seemingly beyond the control of any agency, and beyond control of the police. To put it simply, this is the subculture of the gang and, as such, is nothing new for inner-city London. But the gang culture of today is perhaps more disturbing than ever because of the extreme youth of those it attracts - and the extreme youth of some of its victims. </p> <p>In Peckham, where the black population is the majority, both gang members and their victims are usually black. \"What we are seeing is more extremes of violence among teenagers and young kids. We are seeing extreme lifestyles and a willingness to use weapons. There is a thing among young people to use violence at the moment,\" says one black police officer, who works with families affected by violence in this area. </p> <p>Nobody disputes that gang culture is spreading here. Not far from where Damilola bled to death, another teenager was stabbed and killed just a week ago. Seven people were injured at a nightclub shooting along the same stretch of road about a month ago. A 17-year-old, Andre Drummond, was knifed to death outside McDonald's in nearby Camberwell earlier this year. Andre had recently been excluded from school. </p> <p>The latest statistics for the area show that while crime in general is down, violent crime is rising. In October 2000 there were 854 instances of violent crime in the London borough of Southwark, 54 more than occurred in October last year and part of a steady rise. </p> <p>One local community worker explains what is happening: \"Young people in these areas are more desperate than ever. Those who are black and excluded feel there is nothing in mainstream culture for them. They are lonely and uncared for. They are looking for a way of finding their identity and many cannot resist turning to the gangs.\" </p> <p>Youth provision for children in areas such as Peckham is pitiful. The schools are usually too hard-pressed, trying to achieve targets to focus attention on youth clubs or other youth services. The borough of Southwark is one of the most deprived in the country, where vulnerable teenagers often come from broken homes and find little hope of breaking free of the cycle of poverty around them. \"They feel they have to give 200% just to stand still,\" says a black youth worker. </p> <p>As one former Peckham gang member puts it: \"It's lawless out there on the street, but the laws are our laws, right. We want respect and we make sure we get it.\" The gang subculture also comes with its own ready-made economy: drugs. \"It's easy money. I started selling puff to kids on their way to school. I was good at it,\" says another former gang member, now in Feltham prison for young offenders. </p> <p>\"They look around and feel there is no future for them,\" says another community worker. \"But they are kids and like all kids they need to feel good about themselves. They are confused about their identity so they join a gang. It gives them a recognition. It gives them their own set of rules and relationships. It means you can hang out with those who are like you rather than those who want to change you.\" </p> <p>There is also little doubt about the extreme levels of violence among the youth gangs, or that they are recruiting younger and younger members. At Kids Company, a young people's club on Camberwell Road, former gang members talk of joining gangs as young as 12 or 13. \"It's the norm for kids like us. It's what everyone does. Maybe you go to prison. Maybe you don't. But if you do, you'll find all your mates there, so why not?\" says one who says he has decided to leave the gang life behind. \"It's good money for a few years but then what?\" he asks. </p> <p>The gang members say the recruiting grounds are often in the schools or among children excluded from schools. Southwark schools all have high numbers of children barred for disruptive behaviour. Many of these youngsters fall through the education net and are excluded several times before being effectively lost to the authorities. Some are as young as 14. </p> <p>While the extent of the crisis among alienated children and teenagers is evident, however, nobody working in the field claims to have any answers. Police appear frustrated, unable to penetrate the operations of the gangs, and fear a community backlash should they probe too far. \"They are like a defeated army. They don't know how to handle it,\" says one south London solicitor. </p> <p>Community workers also despair of being able to reach the alienated youngsters who are attracted by the gangs. Two youth clubs in the Peckham area have recently had to close down due to gang violence on their premises. The schools, meanwhile, will play down any suggestion that youth violence spills on to their playgrounds for fear of destabilising their already vulnerable children. Headteachers prefer to turn a blind eye. The question is: where, after the killing of Damilola Taylor, will it be possible to turn a blind eye to? </p> <p> <strong>Related special report</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/\">Policing crime</a></p> <p> <strong>Related stories</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,404947,00.html\">30 November: Straw appeals to public after 'evil' schoolboy murder</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404836,00.html\">30 November: 'My son is dead and I am bitter'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/leaders/story/0,3604,404700,00.html\">Leader: Death in Peckham</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404901,00.html\">30 November: Head defends bullying record</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,404903,00.html\">30 November: Estate is 'one of toughest in Europe'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,404508,00.html\">29 November: Boys murder should be wake-up call - Straw</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404333,00.html\">29 November: Death of a school boy</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong></p> <p> <br><a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\">Metropolitan police</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/\">The home office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/100/100821.pdf\">Ofsted report: the Oliver Goldsmith primary school</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.southlondononline.co.uk/\">Local media: South London online</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.southwark.gov.uk/\">London borough of Southwark</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.thereal.com/o-041798.html\">Photographs of the North Peckham estate</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Town halls will be able to levy the full council tax rate on second homes under a five point plan unveiled by John Prescott to transform the countryside with more affordable housing and improved services for remote communities. </p> <p>The new deal for rural England, which will safeguard post offices, subsidise village shops, pubs and garages, improve public transport and bolster market towns, will also bring about wholesale changes to the post-war planning system which has kept intact the best farming land. </p> <p>Unveiling a lengthy rural white paper, the deputy prime minister announced that the number of \"social\" homes let by housing associations would be doubled to 3,000 a year in three years time. </p> <p>One housing charity said this move would merely bring the number to the level provided in 1996 by the last government. </p> <p>However, the biggest uproar yesterday was caused by plans to let councils charge, after consultation, the full council tax for more than 200,000 second homes (a further 300,000 are let as holiday properties). At the moment second home owners get a 50% tax discount, which costs councils an estimated \u00a3150m annually in lost revenue. </p> <p>While some Conservatives labelled the move vindictive, the chairman of the government's countryside agency, Ewen Cameron, who is effectively the prime minister's chief rural adviser, came close to accusing ministers of fighting shy of tougher measures. </p> <p>Mr Cameron, a Somerset farmer who once chaired the Country Landowners' Association, said ministers should have forced councils to slap the full tax on second homes, rather than give them discretion to do so. He said: \"People who have moved to a community because they think it is desirable have contributed very little to make it desirable and the least they can do is pay the full council tax.\" </p> <p>Moria Constable, chief executive of the Rural Housing Trust, backed the criticism calling the move a fudge and warning that many councils would not increase the tax unless directed to do so. </p> <p>But generally all parties welcomed many of the white paper's proposals. </p> <p>Mr Prescott told the Commons that the government wanted a \"living countryside with thriving rural communities and high-quality services...a working countryside\". The plan, he said, was dedicated to tackling poverty, improving services and the economy, protecting the environment, and giving people a wider choice. Referring to Labour's measures to regenerate cities, with construction on brownfield sites, so saving perhaps thousands of acres of countryside, Mr Prescott warned against dividing town and country. He would study all proposals for building in rural areas. \"We will build on urban brownfield first and greenfield last.\" </p> <p>Some of the most adventurous proposals involve radical changes to the post-war farming policy. Funds will be diverted from agriculture to support other rural enterprises - a recognition that farming is in such steep decline that radical measures are needed to transform the countryside without damage to the environment. </p> <p>By 2006, through a switch of EU common agricultural funds, about \u00a31.6bn - 10% of total agricultural support - in Britain will go annually on other ventures, including tourism and alternative industries.

      "bodyText": "Town halls will be able to levy the full council tax rate on second homes under a five point plan unveiled by John Prescott to transform the countryside with more affordable housing and improved services for remote communities. The new deal for rural England, which will safeguard post offices, subsidise village shops, pubs and garages, improve public transport and bolster market towns, will also bring about wholesale changes to the post-war planning system which has kept intact the best farming land. Unveiling a lengthy rural white paper, the deputy prime minister announced that the number of \"social\" homes let by housing associations would be doubled to 3,000 a year in three years time. One housing charity said this move would merely bring the number to the level provided in 1996 by the last government. However, the biggest uproar yesterday was caused by plans to let councils charge, after consultation, the full council tax for more than 200,000 second homes (a further 300,000 are let as holiday properties). At the moment second home owners get a 50% tax discount, which costs councils an estimated \u00a3150m annually in lost revenue. While some Conservatives labelled the move vindictive, the chairman of the government's countryside agency, Ewen Cameron, who is effectively the prime minister's chief rural adviser, came close to accusing ministers of fighting shy of tougher measures. Mr Cameron, a Somerset farmer who once chaired the Country Landowners' Association, said ministers should have forced councils to slap the full tax on second homes, rather than give them discretion to do so. He said: \"People who have moved to a community because they think it is desirable have contributed very little to make it desirable and the least they can do is pay the full council tax.\" Moria Constable, chief executive of the Rural Housing Trust, backed the criticism calling the move a fudge and warning that many councils would not increase the tax unless directed to do so. But generally all parties welcomed many of the white paper's proposals. Mr Prescott told the Commons that the government wanted a \"living countryside with thriving rural communities and high-quality services...a working countryside\". The plan, he said, was dedicated to tackling poverty, improving services and the economy, protecting the environment, and giving people a wider choice. Referring to Labour's measures to regenerate cities, with construction on brownfield sites, so saving perhaps thousands of acres of countryside, Mr Prescott warned against dividing town and country. He would study all proposals for building in rural areas. \"We will build on urban brownfield first and greenfield last.\" Some of the most adventurous proposals involve radical changes to the post-war farming policy. Funds will be diverted from agriculture to support other rural enterprises - a recognition that farming is in such steep decline that radical measures are needed to transform the countryside without damage to the environment. By 2006, through a switch of EU common agricultural funds, about \u00a31.6bn - 10% of total agricultural support - in Britain will go annually on other ventures, including tourism and alternative industries. Besides this, the agriculture ministry's veto on planning applications for agricultural land will be lifted. Since 1945, governments have stipulated protection of land classed as \"the best and most versatile\". Mentioning the new legislation giving greater access to the countryside and its protection, Mr Prescott was at pains to underline the government's green credentials. Other ministers weighed in yesterday to support the rural agenda of Labour, which now has more rural MPs than the Conservatives. David Blunkett, the education secretary, said the government had cut the number of village school closures to only four a year - from an average of 30 - and that this year \u00a380m had been earmarked to support small country schools. The main points \u0095 Town halls to be given powers to levy the full council tax on second homes \u0095 50% rate relief for village shops, pubs and garages which offer wider benefits to the community such as cash machines \u0095 \u00a3100m for one-stop health centres in 100 communities \u0095 Revitalisation of rural post offices with \u00a3270m of investment \u0095 \u00a3240m for rural transport schemes in addition to a \u00a315m special transport fund to support taxis, car clubs and community transport \u0095 The strengthening of parish and town councils by awarding the best of them new powers to provide a range of facilities while drawing up local plans",

Steve Morrison, executive chairman of Granada Media, has publicly hinted that the network is now secretly trying to persuade the ITC to allow it to either delay or scrap plans to bring back the bulletin. But he has admitted that it is almost certainly a lost cause. Mr Morrison said today: \"We are coming up to an election and I don't think it's appropriate for the two channels to have news on at the same time. \"The question is, is it good for democracy that the two major channels have their news programmes on at the same time? It is a dialogue we are having with the ITC as to what is the best solution. \"We negotiated a good agreement originally, but the goalposts have moved and we don't know yet what the ITC will do.\" The Granada chief said that the damage caused by the clash of the bulletins would be evident in the run-up to the general election. \"I don't think it is appropriate for the two channels to have news at the same time,\" he added. The Granada chief's remarks reflect fears that the public will not be served by two prime-time news bulletins running head to head. The scheduling clash will divide the nation with predictions that as few as 3m viewers tuning into either bulletin. This could have a devastating effect on ITV's commercial revenue in the hours that follow News at Ten. ITV programme director David Liddiment said last week that he was full-square behind the move to bring back News at Ten. However, Mr Morrison's comments will carry much weight, given Granada's position as one of the two biggest ITV companies in the network. He added that viewing figures will be the BBC's biggest test, with culture secretary Chris Smith keeping a close eye on the situation. TV watchdogs ordered ITV in September to reinstate the News at Ten on at least three nights a week. Mr Morrison admitted it would be difficult to see the ITC climbing down now. \"We have our agreement and it is harder to undo an agreement than to do an agreement,\" he said. However, it was seen as an imperfect compromise driven through by new ITC boss Patricia Hodgson. At the time the ITC was facing a High Court action brought by ITV bosses who were determined to challenge an earlier order by the regulator to bring forward the 11pm Nightly News.",

      "bodyText": "Granada Media boss Charles Allen has shrugged off fears that falling advertising revenues will continue to dog his company next year. Despite posting a rise in full-year revenues and profits, analysts remain concerned about Granada's advertising prospects, reviving the concerns that pummelled the company's shares last month. Granada reported a downturn in year-on-year advertising revenues for October, contributing to a stock market decline that sent the company's shares below 400p. Mr Allen said: \"All the companies which used advertising were affected by a downturn in the market, from TF1 to Carlton. \"You cannot just extrapolate one month's advertising performance when we had an 8.4% increase in advertising turnover for the whole year.\" Granada Media's chairman added that it was \"a bit too early to tell\" how the advertising market would be affected next year as internet companies begin to run out of cash. \"We are in the midst of negotiating prices, but we are going into it more confidently than we might have done in October,\" he said. However, analysts have predicted that advertising growth will be limited to 3.5% next year before returning to its usual range of 4% to 6%. Continuing uncertainty over such a vital revenue stream saw Granada's shares fall 3.5p to 378.5p by late afternoon. Granada believes much of the downturn will be offset by the 2.5 extra minutes of peak-time advertising space that ITV will receive when the News at Ten returns in January. The Independent Television Commission offered the space as a sweetener for demanding the return of the flagship bulletin. Steve Morrison, chief executive of Granada Media, said: \"The flexibility that the ITC has given us will be very helpful because we have the opportunity to have more or less breaks as we choose in our peak-time programmes. \"Advertisers have been very worried about the clutter around their adverts.\"",

The panel, headed by the Tate director, Sir Nicholas Serota, declared itself impressed by his ability to create striking images from everyday subjects, and said he was taking photography in new directions, not only in technique but also in presentation.</p> <p>The triumph of a photographer was a bonus for the Stuckists, the anarchic art movement co-founded by Billy Childish, a former boyfriend of artist Tracy Emin - the name comes from her bitter insult that his art was stuck - who turned up in clown suits last night to picket the awards ceremony at Tate Britain in London.</p> <p>The Stuckists are scathing about the Turner prize, and the Tate director, saying both have betrayed the traditional skills of drawing and painting.

      "bodyText": "Photographer Wolfgang Tillmans beat an embroiderer, an artfully arranged pile of rubbish, and a painter accused of plagiarising the work of an obscure science fiction illustrator, to take the \u00a320,000 Turner prize last night. German-born Tillmans, who has worked and exhibited in London in recent years, has smashed the boundary between commercial photography and art: much of his early work was for fashion magazines, including a famous image of four of his friends sitting in the branches of a tree, not wearing any clothes at all. The jury said his work engaged with contemporary culture, while challenging conventional aesthetics. The panel, headed by the Tate director, Sir Nicholas Serota, declared itself impressed by his ability to create striking images from everyday subjects, and said he was taking photography in new directions, not only in technique but also in presentation. The triumph of a photographer was a bonus for the Stuckists, the anarchic art movement co-founded by Billy Childish, a former boyfriend of artist Tracy Emin - the name comes from her bitter insult that his art was stuck - who turned up in clown suits last night to picket the awards ceremony at Tate Britain in London. The Stuckists are scathing about the Turner prize, and the Tate director, saying both have betrayed the traditional skills of drawing and painting. Sir Nicholas lashed back in his Dimbleby lecture last week: the new media - including video, sound pieces and conceptual art - were here to stay, he said; there was no chance that contemporary art would \"come to its senses\" and turn the clock back. This year's shortlist was a poor platform for Stuckist protests, with Glenn Brown working in oil on canvas with a technique described as \"old masterly\", and Michael Raedecker's delicate figurative landscapes in paint and embroidery. But Tillmans's success was a gift to them. \"Art is art and photography is photography,\" snarled co-founder Charles Thompson, a painter. Tillmans's victory - he was an early favourite of the bookmakers - was overshadowed by bickering about whether imitation of one artist's work by another is flattery or plagiarism. The Turner prize has lifted contemporary art on to a new publicity plane, partly by generating an annual row about the nature of art. In the past the dispute has been about Tracy Emin's rumpled bed (pipped for last year's prize), Chris Ofili's elephant dung (which took the prize two years ago) and Damien Hirst's pickled shark (a winner in 1995). This year there seemed nothing to fight about except the fact that three of the four artists were not born in Britain, and that the shy Japanese Tomoko Takahashi works with carefully arranged piles of rubbish. The calm was broken with the 11th-hour revelation, emanating from science fiction addicts with long memories, that a huge canvas by Glenn Brown borrowed heavily from a 1974 Pan book jacket by Anthony Roberts, for a novel called Double Star. The fact that Mr Brown's other works on show borrowed equally heavily from Watteau, Auerbach and Salvador Dali, and that the painting was labelled \"The Loves of the Shepherds (after Tony Roberts)\" did nothing to quell the storm. Copyright experts and the Association of Illustrators said they were uneasy. By last night Anthony Roberts had been tracked down in East Sussex, and seemed amused rather than outraged: he'd known nothing about it, he said, and this was the only Turner prize exhibition he'd missed in years. Glenn Brown said he had tried to contact the publishers, but got no response. \"I'm a fan of all the artists I refer to, including Tony Roberts. I pick artists I like and those that I feel aren't given enough credit, such as Watteau, John Martin and Chris Foss.\" He also maintained he had \"radically altered Roberts's work in terms of scale and colour\".

      "bodyText": "Chronic shortages of midwives and huge regional variations in maternity services mean new mothers' needs are being neglected and lives put at risk, the Royal College of Midwives said today. MPs from all parties have joined forces to launch a new group which will investigate standards of maternity care throughout the country. Midwives have been warning for months that low morale in the profession has contributed to worrying staff shortages and potentially dangerous working practices. Last year only two thirds of deliveries were carried out by a midwife rather than an obstetrician, down from almost three quarters in 1996. The Royal College of Midwives has warned that its members are being forced to work double shifts to make up for staff shortages, and many maternity units cannot offer women constant one-to-one care while they are in labour. Caesarean sections now account for almost one in five births, despite evidence that unnecessary medical intervention can be harmful to mother and baby. The government has pledged to supply an extra 20,000 nurses and midwives by 2004 but it is unclear how many of those will be midwives. Recent research showed that out of the 5,744 midwives working in the NHS this year, 550 had joined in the last 12 months but 531 had left, making a net gain of just 19 staff. The all-party parliamentary group on maternity care launched today will address standards of care and raise awareness of the problems. Chairman Julia Drown, Labour MP for Swindon South, said: \"Maternity services care for over 600,000 women and babies each year and yet there are huge variations in the quality of service women receive nationally. \"Some women may not receive specialist care when it is needed, while others may be put at risk by unnecessary medical intervention. \"Women's social needs are often neglected, especially in the postnatal period, often putting family relationships and even children at risk.\" Health minister Yvette Cooper said: \"Clearly, every woman should have a midwife present at birth - that is absolutely the bottom line. \"But under the last government, in fact, what happened between 1991 and 1997 the number of midwives working in the NHS dropped by over 1,000. \"Now since the election this government has increased the number of midwives working in the NHS.

      "bodyText": "Damilola Taylor collapsed on the concrete stairs in between the first and second floors of the bleak council block, less than five minutes walk from home. Lying in the cold and dark, the 10-year-old had no energy to go on. He may not have understood why he was being bullied at school, or why some other children taunted him about being \"gay\" - the word meant nothing to him. Living on one of the toughest council estates in south London, he may not have appreciated why his family had moved from Nigeria to give him \"a better life\". But Damilola probably knew his life was slipping away. He knew the sight of blood. And blood was pouring from a wound to his left leg, drenching his school trousers, maroon pullover and trainers. It was trickling down the stairwell to the groundfloor. He was alone in the urine-stained stairwell when he died. Six passersby tried to stem the blood with their fingers and thumbs. Minutes later, a team of paramedics began a futile effort to revive him. Detectives piecing together what happened to Damilola as he walked home from Oliver Goldsmith primary school in Southwark on Monday at 4.45pm had one clue. A trail of blood which led them from the stairwell to a spot 100 yards away in Blakes Road. This is where they assume Damilola was attacked, possibly by three youths, aged between 11 and 17, who were seen running away from scene. Damilola was within sight of home when he was stabbed but the loss of blood was so severe he stumbled before he reached the first-floor shops in the North Hordle Promenade where he probably hoped to find help. \"His femoral artery was slashed,\" said one officer who is part of the murder inquiry. \"It's like the jugular vein. \"Blood would have come out like a fountain. He didn't really stand a chance.\" Damilola came to London four months ago with his mother Gloria - who had lived in the UK once before - his brother Tunde, 21, and sister Beme, 23. His father is still in Nigeria. Southwark council placed them in a flat in St Braivel's Court, part of the North Peckham estate which was built in the late 60s and is now being bulldozed. Only half of the homes on the estate are now occupied. Damilola seemed to settle well, but had recently confided to his mother that he was being bullied at school. \"He was being threatened by other students,\" said Mrs Taylor, 49. \"Last Friday he said some boys had beaten him, boys from the school. \"I asked 'did you fight with them?'.

He said he was in pain.\" On one occasion, Damilola, who was normal, playful and boisterous, had asked his mother to explain the meaning of the the word \"gay\". \"Boys were swearing at him, saying lots of horrible words.

That is where poor people live.

      "bodyText": "Overall there is less poverty and exclusion in rural districts than in urban ones. That - the conclusion of an exhaustive survey of income, schooling and employment carried out for the Countryside Agency* - should be it. A government intent on relieving poverty, which social security secretary Alistair Darling said the other evening was exactly Labour's priority, need only look to the cities. That is where poor people live. Policy should not stray far from inner London, Birmingham and the big cities of the north. The chart is based on the survey of households with below-average income compiled by Mr Darling's department. If you look at each \"percentile\" on the distributions of income for rural and urban England, people living in the cities get by on less - nearly 10% a week less for the very poorest. That social fact alone ought to squash the hyperbolic campaign waged by the fox hunters and farmers.

The sackings, last Friday, highlight the trend among employers to crack down on the alleged misuse of electronic communications. Last month Holset Engineering, a maker of turbo chargers, successfully defended its dismissal of two employees who were found to have sent smutty emails to around 40 other staff. Holset, based in Huddersfield, trawled internal mailboxes when an employee complained after being sent a \"joke\" email. Two staff members, David Pennington and Rupert Beverley, were accused of gross misconduct and sacked because they were alleged to have transmitted the highest number of emails with the most sexually explicit attachments, lawyers for the company said. The employees said they were unaware of any company policy that outlawed smutty jokes in emails. Holset argued that its policy was clear and all staff had been sent on a training course that dealt with the harassment of colleagues via the email system. At Cable &amp; Wireless the staff concerned, who worked in the Birmingham sales office, were suspended immediately, with dismissal following a hearing one week later. One of those sacked said the email to which the company took exception contained an obscenity. Several are expected to use the company's internal appeals procedure, claiming that misuse of the computer system is rife and they have been singled out unfairly. All of the staff involved are understood to have been employed at C&amp;W for less than a year and consequently will be prevented from appealing to an industrial tribunal. The ruling in favour of Holset Engineering and the C&amp;W case come amid confusion about what rights employers have to oversee staff emails. New data protection rules and the Human Rights Act are untested in the courts but appear to prevent employers from opening any communications by staff unless the employees are suspected of criminal acts. These rules are widely believed to be contradicted by government regulations that became law on October 24 allowing employers to access information in specific circumstances.",

      "body": "<p>Tacked to a noticeboard in the cinema foyer, jostling with offers of English lessons, second-hand bicycles and a kitten called Alberto, is a small poster. Typed black letters explain that a Hollywood blockbuster is coming to Rome and would anyone interested in participating please phone the number at the bottom. There is no number, or a bottom, just a jagged rip. Gotta move fast in this business. </p> <p>It takes a while to track him down, but the voice at the end of the line is welcoming. \"There are still some vacancies. You'll have such fun!\" And so a few days later I am on a metro rattling east of Rome. Emerging from the station, a sliver of moon hangs over the darkness. It is a cold 5.45am. </p> <p>Dozens, hundreds of silhouettes tramp down the road in silence. We stop at the gate of a walled complex and wait for a bearded man in denim to finish scratching. \"Everything in good time, children.\" In groups of six we are allowed to enter the fabled Cinecitta studios. The magical world of movie making beckons. </p> <p>Believe the hype (we do) and what awaits is the box-office hit of 2001. The Gangs of New York has a $90m budget, Martin Scorsese (pictured) directing, Leo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Daniel Day Lewis and Liam Neeson starring, and us. There isn't really a verb for us. We are extras. We be. </p> <p>During the next few hours we will be part of Team Hollywood, giving our best in exchange for a peek inside the machine. Given the flight of productions from America to places where costs are lower, this could be a glimpse of the future. At this stage of production, secrecy is needed to allow suspense to build before the publicity blitz. Journalists and photographers are not welcome. Lucky for me that the producers want Irish-looking people. Freckles and red hair are gold dust. </p> <p>Dawn seeps over us to unveil the day's first extraordinary sight. Ginger Romans. Perms, waves and buzz cuts are tinged orange. They glint in the sun, each strand painstakingly dyed. A hush of respect envelopes this minority. When returning to the real world they will be ridiculed. They will suffer for their art. </p> <p>After signing away our rights to compensation should an act of God or Scorsese strike us dead, we file into three costume warehouses. The film is about rival immigrant gangs vying for control of 1850s New York. A few well-dressed Yanks are to be sprinkled among 600 soldiers and ragamuffins. We strip down to our underpants - boxer shorts for foreigners, Y-fronts for Romans - while dressers scour racks for coordinated outfits that fit. The female dressers affect a clinical, nurse-type demeanour. Their male colleagues, camp as a row of a tents, flirt. \"You are a big boy; let's go to this dark corner and see what we find.\" Not even the tattooed Lazio fans dare object. </p> <p>Attention to detail is fanatical. Shirt, waistcoat, jacket, trousers, socks and boots are matched. If the buttons don't look right, they are replaced. Archive pictures of Irish villagers during the famine are scattered on tables. My third outfit is deemed acceptable: brown boots, socks, trousers and braces, stripy white shirt, purple waistcoat and fudgey jacket. Everything itches. My hair is judged an asset so a bowler hat is discarded. Make-up teams smear grease on heads and three types of dirt on faces, hands and nails. Staring back from the mirror is what Oliver Twist would look like after being rammed up a chimney. In the trailer toilets a 20-year-old is desperately rinsing his tresses in the sink. \"Ruined,\" he wails. </p> <p>Breakfast is one, and only one, pastry each. Too late a veteran murmurs his wisdom. \"Eat before make-up, then they won't recognise you when you go back for another.\" An extra with a handlebar moustache is caught taking a photo of his friend in leprechaun-green. The film is destroyed, the camera confiscated. Stuffing newspapers and books down trousers to read later, we are herded to the set. </p> <p>Benito Mussolini wasn't totally daft. It was his idea in 1936 to turn 600 hectares of real estate into one of the world's greatest studios. After the second world war, Cinecitta incubated directors such as Fellini and Visconti and enjoyed a golden age with films such as Cleopatra, Spartacus, War and Peace, A Farewell to Arms and La Dolce Vita. </p> <p>Dante Ferretti's set designs were famous. He is still here. Yawning up around us are New York tenement slums, bakeries, warehouses, docklands, ships. Streets are cobbled, laundry hangs from windows, stoves puff smoke. The lemons are real, the fish are not. The sign saying \"P. Daily's Fish Market\" is exquisitely faded. Green water laps the harbour. A blue screen blocks the horizon. </p> <p> A production assistant on the verge of tears bellows at the milling crowd in Roman dialect. \"Please, order, please.\" People in jeans, runners and sunglasses materialise from trailers, muttering into earpieces. They are the Americans. The director is on his way. </p> <p>Scorsese made Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, but has never won an Oscar or had a global box-office smash. Gangs, based on the book by Herbert Ashbury, could be the one to change that. He arrives driving a golf cart with two personal assistants who will never leave his side. Wearing jeans, runners and a blazer, he hops out and backslaps the cast. He is very small. </p> <p>Despite being seven days behind schedule, the entire day is devoted to one complicated shot where a single camera will track DiCaprio walking past rows of seated customs officials, follow new arrivals being led away, skim past a battalion marching through a fish market, glide up on a crane to catch soldiers entering a ship and glide down to catch coffins being lowered onto the docks. A lesser director would use five cameras and an editing suite. </p> <p>Scorsese is sprawling in a chair during a lull when my mobile trills. An assistant turns white. \"Christ, turn it off, Marty will get his axe and cut your head off.\" The assistant is trembling, though Marty appears not to have heard. An extra sidles up. \"He looks friendly, but that's only with the actors. We don't exist. Last week he was walking through us and we didn't get out of the way in time. He shouted that we should know who he was.\" </p> <p>A sudden silence announces the arrival of DiCaprio.

      "bodyText": "Tacked to a noticeboard in the cinema foyer, jostling with offers of English lessons, second-hand bicycles and a kitten called Alberto, is a small poster. Typed black letters explain that a Hollywood blockbuster is coming to Rome and would anyone interested in participating please phone the number at the bottom. There is no number, or a bottom, just a jagged rip. Gotta move fast in this business. It takes a while to track him down, but the voice at the end of the line is welcoming. \"There are still some vacancies. You'll have such fun!\" And so a few days later I am on a metro rattling east of Rome. Emerging from the station, a sliver of moon hangs over the darkness. It is a cold 5.45am. Dozens, hundreds of silhouettes tramp down the road in silence. We stop at the gate of a walled complex and wait for a bearded man in denim to finish scratching. \"Everything in good time, children.\" In groups of six we are allowed to enter the fabled Cinecitta studios. The magical world of movie making beckons. Believe the hype (we do) and what awaits is the box-office hit of 2001. The Gangs of New York has a $90m budget, Martin Scorsese (pictured) directing, Leo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Daniel Day Lewis and Liam Neeson starring, and us. There isn't really a verb for us. We are extras. We be. During the next few hours we will be part of Team Hollywood, giving our best in exchange for a peek inside the machine. Given the flight of productions from America to places where costs are lower, this could be a glimpse of the future. At this stage of production, secrecy is needed to allow suspense to build before the publicity blitz. Journalists and photographers are not welcome. Lucky for me that the producers want Irish-looking people. Freckles and red hair are gold dust. Dawn seeps over us to unveil the day's first extraordinary sight. Ginger Romans. Perms, waves and buzz cuts are tinged orange. They glint in the sun, each strand painstakingly dyed. A hush of respect envelopes this minority. When returning to the real world they will be ridiculed. They will suffer for their art. After signing away our rights to compensation should an act of God or Scorsese strike us dead, we file into three costume warehouses. The film is about rival immigrant gangs vying for control of 1850s New York. A few well-dressed Yanks are to be sprinkled among 600 soldiers and ragamuffins. We strip down to our underpants - boxer shorts for foreigners, Y-fronts for Romans - while dressers scour racks for coordinated outfits that fit. The female dressers affect a clinical, nurse-type demeanour. Their male colleagues, camp as a row of a tents, flirt. \"You are a big boy; let's go to this dark corner and see what we find.\" Not even the tattooed Lazio fans dare object. Attention to detail is fanatical. Shirt, waistcoat, jacket, trousers, socks and boots are matched. If the buttons don't look right, they are replaced. Archive pictures of Irish villagers during the famine are scattered on tables. My third outfit is deemed acceptable: brown boots, socks, trousers and braces, stripy white shirt, purple waistcoat and fudgey jacket. Everything itches. My hair is judged an asset so a bowler hat is discarded. Make-up teams smear grease on heads and three types of dirt on faces, hands and nails. Staring back from the mirror is what Oliver Twist would look like after being rammed up a chimney. In the trailer toilets a 20-year-old is desperately rinsing his tresses in the sink. \"Ruined,\" he wails. Breakfast is one, and only one, pastry each. Too late a veteran murmurs his wisdom. \"Eat before make-up, then they won't recognise you when you go back for another.\" An extra with a handlebar moustache is caught taking a photo of his friend in leprechaun-green. The film is destroyed, the camera confiscated. Stuffing newspapers and books down trousers to read later, we are herded to the set. Benito Mussolini wasn't totally daft. It was his idea in 1936 to turn 600 hectares of real estate into one of the world's greatest studios. After the second world war, Cinecitta incubated directors such as Fellini and Visconti and enjoyed a golden age with films such as Cleopatra, Spartacus, War and Peace, A Farewell to Arms and La Dolce Vita. Dante Ferretti's set designs were famous. He is still here. Yawning up around us are New York tenement slums, bakeries, warehouses, docklands, ships. Streets are cobbled, laundry hangs from windows, stoves puff smoke. The lemons are real, the fish are not. The sign saying \"P. Daily's Fish Market\" is exquisitely faded. Green water laps the harbour. A blue screen blocks the horizon. A production assistant on the verge of tears bellows at the milling crowd in Roman dialect. \"Please, order, please.\" People in jeans, runners and sunglasses materialise from trailers, muttering into earpieces. They are the Americans. The director is on his way. Scorsese made Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, but has never won an Oscar or had a global box-office smash. Gangs, based on the book by Herbert Ashbury, could be the one to change that. He arrives driving a golf cart with two personal assistants who will never leave his side. Wearing jeans, runners and a blazer, he hops out and backslaps the cast. He is very small. Despite being seven days behind schedule, the entire day is devoted to one complicated shot where a single camera will track DiCaprio walking past rows of seated customs officials, follow new arrivals being led away, skim past a battalion marching through a fish market, glide up on a crane to catch soldiers entering a ship and glide down to catch coffins being lowered onto the docks. A lesser director would use five cameras and an editing suite. Scorsese is sprawling in a chair during a lull when my mobile trills. An assistant turns white. \"Christ, turn it off, Marty will get his axe and cut your head off.\" The assistant is trembling, though Marty appears not to have heard. An extra sidles up. \"He looks friendly, but that's only with the actors. We don't exist. Last week he was walking through us and we didn't get out of the way in time. He shouted that we should know who he was.\" A sudden silence announces the arrival of DiCaprio. Beneath a top hat his face is pasty and bloated compared to the way it looked in his last film, The Beach. Too much pasta and nightlife, say the Italian papers. Scorsese has put him on a diet but tolerates his smoking, forbidden to others. DiCaprio leans on a pillar and plays \"chicken\", the hand-slapping game, with another actor.

      "body": "<p>A step was taken yesterday towards integration of complementary and alternative medicine into the NHS with a House of Lords select committee report that urged greater regulation but called for doctors and nurses to listen to patients' growing demands and recognise the potential for good of unconventional therapies. </p> <p>After 15 months study the Lords select committee on science and technology produced a 140-page report that points a clear way forward through what has been a minefield for politicians in the past. It wants the NHS make it easier for patients to gain access to therapies that work and give patients more and better information about what works and what does not. </p> <p>The Lords does not embrace all the therapies, some with a spiritual dimension, which have taken off in the UK, but thereport is careful not to tar any of them. Peers distinguish between those disciplines such as osteopathy and chiropractic that are well regulated and have good evidence to show they work, a second group of \"feel-good\" therapies which complement conventional medicine and do no harm, and a third group which \"cannot be supported unless and until convincing research evidence of efficacy, based upon the results of well-designed trials, can be produced\". </p> <p>The one point of serious controversy in the report is likely to be the inclusion of traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine (an ancient Indian discipline) in the third list of unproven treatments. Both disciplines go back thousands of years and are extensively practised in China and India. </p> <p>Asked if he would use any of the complementary and alternative medicine remedies, Lord Walton of Detchant, who chaired the sub-committee running the inquiry, said: \"I would have no difficulty at all if I had troublesome back pain which was not helped by visits to the doctor in consulting an osteopath or a chiropractor. If I was in intolerable pain, I'd at least consider acupuncture. I'd be perfectly prepared to consider herbal remedies that are shown by research to be effective forms of treatment.\" </p> <p>He would also consider aromatherapy and other complementary therapies listed in the report's second group. But he said: \"I would not personally be willing to take advantage of any in group three.\" </p> <p>The Lords acknowledged the rise of alternative medicine was driven by public demand, fuelled by distrust of conventional drugs and disillusion with doctors who could spare them only a few minutes. A therapist, by contrast, would spend up to an hour discussing the emotional as well as physical problems of the patient. </p> <p>The committee felt there was a need for the public to be given better information and to be helped to find reputable, trained and accredited practitioners. Members recognised a danger that some people would turn their back on conventional drugs to embrace alternative \"cures\" that made them feel better but failed to tackle the underlying disease which might be killing them. </p> <p>Much more research into alternative therapies was needed, the report said, recommending that the NHS and the Medical Research Council should put in money to develop centres of excellence akin to the successful National Center for Complementary Alternative Medicine in the United States.

      "bodyText": "A step was taken yesterday towards integration of complementary and alternative medicine into the NHS with a House of Lords select committee report that urged greater regulation but called for doctors and nurses to listen to patients' growing demands and recognise the potential for good of unconventional therapies. After 15 months study the Lords select committee on science and technology produced a 140-page report that points a clear way forward through what has been a minefield for politicians in the past. It wants the NHS make it easier for patients to gain access to therapies that work and give patients more and better information about what works and what does not. The Lords does not embrace all the therapies, some with a spiritual dimension, which have taken off in the UK, but thereport is careful not to tar any of them. Peers distinguish between those disciplines such as osteopathy and chiropractic that are well regulated and have good evidence to show they work, a second group of \"feel-good\" therapies which complement conventional medicine and do no harm, and a third group which \"cannot be supported unless and until convincing research evidence of efficacy, based upon the results of well-designed trials, can be produced\". The one point of serious controversy in the report is likely to be the inclusion of traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine (an ancient Indian discipline) in the third list of unproven treatments. Both disciplines go back thousands of years and are extensively practised in China and India. Asked if he would use any of the complementary and alternative medicine remedies, Lord Walton of Detchant, who chaired the sub-committee running the inquiry, said: \"I would have no difficulty at all if I had troublesome back pain which was not helped by visits to the doctor in consulting an osteopath or a chiropractor. If I was in intolerable pain, I'd at least consider acupuncture. I'd be perfectly prepared to consider herbal remedies that are shown by research to be effective forms of treatment.\" He would also consider aromatherapy and other complementary therapies listed in the report's second group. But he said: \"I would not personally be willing to take advantage of any in group three.\" The Lords acknowledged the rise of alternative medicine was driven by public demand, fuelled by distrust of conventional drugs and disillusion with doctors who could spare them only a few minutes. A therapist, by contrast, would spend up to an hour discussing the emotional as well as physical problems of the patient. The committee felt there was a need for the public to be given better information and to be helped to find reputable, trained and accredited practitioners. Members recognised a danger that some people would turn their back on conventional drugs to embrace alternative \"cures\" that made them feel better but failed to tackle the underlying disease which might be killing them. Much more research into alternative therapies was needed, the report said, recommending that the NHS and the Medical Research Council should put in money to develop centres of excellence akin to the successful National Center for Complementary Alternative Medicine in the United States. Randomised controlled trials, which were required of any conventional medicine, should be carried out to establish how well alternative therapies work. There have been some such trials of herbal remedies, which have established that St John's wort or hypericum, for instance, is effective against depression. But most herbal medicines have not been tested in this way and problems can arise when mixtures are used. The committee said there was good evidence of the efficacy of osteopathy and chiropractic, which could be more effective than physiotherapy, and of acupuncture for pain relief and treatment of nausea. Committee members were \"sceptical about the modes of action of most of the others\", said the report, but they accepted many of the group two therapies helped relieve stress. There was no reason why homeopathy, which was already provided on the NHS, should work - patients were given minuscule doses of whatever was deemed to be causing their problem - but they accepted that it might have a beneficial effect because patients believed it was helping them. Tighter regulation of alternative medicine practitioners was vital, said the report, and only those disciplines which were well regulated should be accessible through the NHS. Acupuncture and herbal medicine should be subject to statutory regulation and there should be a clampdown on misleading labels on herbal medicines, which sometimes made unjustified claims. The report found favour on all sides. The Royal College of Nursing was in favour of more regulation and training and the commitment to patient choice and protection. Peter Fisher, clinical director of the NHS Royal London Homeopathic hospital, said: \"We're quite happy with it. We can't really argue with their main points about high quality information, regulation, which has been a very high priority for us, and research and NHS provision.\"",

The newsagent and wholesaler is also suing H Bauer and Magazine Marketing Company for breach of contract. The move comes after WH Smith was told that Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Mail and Mail on Sunday, would terminate two-thirds of its distribution deals with the WH Smith within six months. Publishers of newspapers and magazines claim that WH Smith is trying to strong-arm them onto its proposed national distribution system, and have criticised its \"bully-boy\" tactics.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, said yesterday the government would have to rely more on taxation and spending policy to control the economy if Britain joined the euro. </p> <p>In remarks likely to fuel the political debate over membership of the monetary union, Sir Eddie told Treasury select committee MPs that ceding control over interest rates to the European Central Bank would shift the burden to fiscal policymaking. </p> <p>\"We would have to look more to fiscal policy ... and that would involve recognition by the people of this country that their behaviour would have to be driven by the need to control control inflation,\" said Sir Eddie. \"That could affect the behaviour of the labour market.\" </p> <p>If Britain joined the euro, say economists, it would be even more important to exercise wage restraint to prevent cost increases feeding through to higher inflation. </p> <p>Without the ability to control interest rates the Treasury may have to increase taxes or cut public spending to prevent a wage-price spiral. </p> <p>In the Bank of England's latest inflation report Sir Eddie said economic convergence would have to be a condition of UK entry to the euro zone. </p> <p>Business for Sterling, the anti-euro lobby group, said spiralling wage claims in Ireland proved Sir Eddie's point. </p> <p>Chief executive Nick Herbert said: \"The last thing Britain's modern economy wants is a return to the nightmare days of rising inflation and failing pay policies. If we had joined the euro two years ago and lost control of interest rates, we would now be suffering a job-destroying inflationary boom.\" </p> <p>But Britain in Europe, the pro-euro lobby group, argued that joining would mean \"safer jobs, more inward investment and greater prosperity\". Pointing out that Sir Eddie had told a House of Lords committee in October that there was \"no question\" that joining the single currency would bring potential economic advantages, Kitty Ussher, the organisation's chief economist, said: \"Decisions on tax would still be up to the British government if we joined the euro - the German government has recently decided to cut taxes.\" </p> <p>Sir Eddie cautioned yesterday's Commons hearing against generalising from the experience of Ireland. It was a small economy suffering from the double impact of euro weakness and its large exposure to the UK. </p> <p>Turning to the outlook for UK interest rates, pegged at 6% since February, Sir Eddie said the Bank was unconcerned about the spending increases announced in the pre-Budget report. </p> <p>The chancellor had simply recycled the extra tax receipts unexpectedly harvested by the Treasury since the last Budget, he said. </p> <p>But the Bank would not hesitate to raise interest rates if the chancellor made large tax cuts next March, threatening the inflation target - even on the eve of a general election. \"It would be our duty, our legal duty, to do what we had to do [to deliver the government's inflation target],\" Sir Eddie said.</p>",

In remarks likely to fuel the political debate over membership of the monetary union, Sir Eddie told Treasury select committee MPs that ceding control over interest rates to the European Central Bank would shift the burden to fiscal policymaking. \"We would have to look more to fiscal policy ... and that would involve recognition by the people of this country that their behaviour would have to be driven by the need to control control inflation,\" said Sir Eddie. \"That could affect the behaviour of the labour market.\" If Britain joined the euro, say economists, it would be even more important to exercise wage restraint to prevent cost increases feeding through to higher inflation. Without the ability to control interest rates the Treasury may have to increase taxes or cut public spending to prevent a wage-price spiral. In the Bank of England's latest inflation report Sir Eddie said economic convergence would have to be a condition of UK entry to the euro zone. Business for Sterling, the anti-euro lobby group, said spiralling wage claims in Ireland proved Sir Eddie's point. Chief executive Nick Herbert said: \"The last thing Britain's modern economy wants is a return to the nightmare days of rising inflation and failing pay policies. If we had joined the euro two years ago and lost control of interest rates, we would now be suffering a job-destroying inflationary boom.\" But Britain in Europe, the pro-euro lobby group, argued that joining would mean \"safer jobs, more inward investment and greater prosperity\". Pointing out that Sir Eddie had told a House of Lords committee in October that there was \"no question\" that joining the single currency would bring potential economic advantages, Kitty Ussher, the organisation's chief economist, said: \"Decisions on tax would still be up to the British government if we joined the euro - the German government has recently decided to cut taxes.\" Sir Eddie cautioned yesterday's Commons hearing against generalising from the experience of Ireland. It was a small economy suffering from the double impact of euro weakness and its large exposure to the UK. Turning to the outlook for UK interest rates, pegged at 6% since February, Sir Eddie said the Bank was unconcerned about the spending increases announced in the pre-Budget report. The chancellor had simply recycled the extra tax receipts unexpectedly harvested by the Treasury since the last Budget, he said. But the Bank would not hesitate to raise interest rates if the chancellor made large tax cuts next March, threatening the inflation target - even on the eve of a general election. \"It would be our duty, our legal duty, to do what we had to do [to deliver the government's inflation target],\" Sir Eddie said.",

      "bodyText": "The killing of a 10-year-old boy in south London should be a wake-up call to British society, the home secretary said today. The murder of Damilola Taylor, who was stabbed to death in Peckham, south-east London, should alert the country to the urgent need for a new culture of responsibility to turn back the tide of thuggery, bullying and violence, Jack Straw said. Police are hunting for three boys seen near Damilola as he bled to death. He was stabbed as he walked home from school, where he had allegedly been bullied. Detectives are carrying out forensic tests on a broken bottle believed to have been a possible murder weapon. In the House of Commons this afternoon the prime minister, Tony Blair, told MPs that the whole country was \"shocked and outraged\" at Damilola's \"appalling and brutal murder\". \"We must do everything we can to bring his killers to justice,\" he said. Earlier Mr Straw told an Institute for Public Policy Research conference in London that clamping down on street violence will be a key task of the next Labour government. His speech followed the publication of statistics which show that while property crime has declined since 1997, violent offences have soared. The home secretary called for a new sense of responsibility in British society to counter the so-called \"lad\" culture of excessive drinking, irresponsibility and violence. Mr Straw was backed by the education secretary, David Blunkett. He criticised passersby who failed to come to the aid of Damilola as he bled to death after being stabbed by older youths. \"We have got to create a society where people do not run away from anything, but face up to it and are prepared to be engaged and involved,\" Mr Blunkett said. Offering his condolences to Damilola's family, Mr Straw added: \"This tragedy is one that must teach and affect us all and one from which we have to draw very important lessons.\" Mr Blunkett also had critical words for the TV quiz show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, which he said undermined social responsibility by fostering a culture in which material wealth and consumption were all-important. Outlining government plans for new measures to tackle disorder on the streets, Mr Straw restated the government's commitment to fixed penalty notices for anti-social behaviour, which were widely derided when the prime minister, Tony Blair, first proposed that drunken louts could be marched to cash dispensing machines for instant fines. Mr Straw said: \"Over the last three years we have shown that we can start to win the war against crime - especially burglary and vehicle crime, which we have specifically been targetting. The next three years, we have to turn the tide against violent crime as well. \"I believe that we can do it. We will give the police the resources and tools that they need. But at the end of the day, it is each individual's sense of social responsibility rather than external sanctions that ultimately will control people's behaviour one towards another.\" Mr Straw promised new laws to regulate nightclub bouncers. He also new powers to shut down rowdy pubs and clubs; to stop on-street drinking; more investment in town centre surveillance cameras.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For three nights, I've been walking among the cemeteries and dank toilets of Cambridge with Sam, a homeless Gypsy who lives in the back of a broken down van. He and his wife have been on the streets for a year, and they are frightened half to death because this year - for the first time in a decade - there will be no government funding for emergency winter shelters for homeless people in the city, or indeed anywhere else outside London. Winter shelters, it seems, are bad for the homeless. </p> <p>Sam is 22, a car mechanic and part-time gardener. He has been sleeping rough since his family kicked him out for marrying a non-Romani. His wife, a slight woman also in her early 20s, has eight GCSEs. </p> <p>Each night we met in the same place, outside a public lavatory, with the steeples of King's and Jesus colleges silhouetted by city lights in the distance. On the first night, five people, including two women, are getting ready to sleep here, on a small concrete porch overlooking the playing fields. When the rain gets too hard, they move into the toilet cubicles, or clamber over the fence to huddle in the changing rooms of the nearby outdoor swimming pool. </p> <p>Across the park, there is another public toilet where an old lady sleeps; she likes to keep the place clean, so she washes the floor during the day. Some of the homeless are mentally ill, many are illiterate; a few are former businessmen or have degrees. </p> <p>Up in the cemetery I find the most tragic couple I have ever seen - crouched in an abandoned outhouse, blankets spread out on the mud floor. An umbrella propped against the sodden wall deflects the flow of water coming through the roof and empty windows. She is about 25, pleasant, polite and ludicrously swaddled. I cannot see his face clearly. He has bowel cancer and is not expected to survive the winter. </p> <p>\"Look where he's lying, sir,\" says Sam. \"There must be somewhere open where they could at least temporarily house him and his wife. Look, how can you sleep with an umbrella above your head?\" The rain splatters across everything. </p> <p>You don't have to be around the city long to get to know how ill or disabled some of these people are. One, familiar to Cambridge people, cannot hear or speak and grunts when he begs for money; another is blind and is often beaten up or has his stick stolen; a third has muscular dystrophy. </p> <p>The city council's latest estimate - based on a count in early October - is that there are 18 people sleeping on the streets. The figure has caused widespread scepticism among homelessness workers and is thoroughly disbelieved by the homeless themselves. \"There's loads more than that,\" retorts the woman in the cemetery. \"About 40.\" Sam and I find 30 in one night, and that is in just two-and-a-half hours, covering about a fifth of the official counting area. </p> <p>There is a lot of money riding on these figures. The government has insisted that it will reduce the number of street sleepers by two-thirds by the year 2002, and Cambridge council housing department relies on government approval to secure funding. It has not gone unnoticed that the council's headcount comfortably meets the target decrease: a 40% reduction over the past three years. </p> <p>\"I've been everywhere in the country as a Romani,\" says Sam, \"but I've never seen so many homeless people as in Cambridge. The trouble is that the council and police don't know about many of the places where the homeless sleep. There's a derelict barge on the river somewhere, for example, and an old hut by the railway station.\" </p> <p>\"Is that the one where you can hear all the rats?' asks one person begging at the University Church. \"Nah,\" replies Sam, \"they've found another skipper since then.\" </p> <p>One place I especially wanted to see was described to me as a strange hole in a wall, where you have to squeeze through a narrow gap to get inside. It is apparently behind a lamp post, but nobody would tell me where in case the word got out. In the absence of a winter shelter, it is particularly important that the best locations remain secret. </p> <p>The other week, at the beginning of the rain storms, the police said that anyone found sleeping on the underground floors of the covered car park near Emmanuel college would be arrested. This was especially bad news because the subterranean floors are among the most popular spots in the city, with up to 15 people sleeping there. They are warm, quiet and almost safe. </p> <p>Then there are the locked places, which nobody thinks the homeless have a key to. As the weather worsens, the fuller they become. Sam knocks on one of them. \"Bunker, it's Sam,\" he shouts. I can hear faint voices, but nobody responds. \"They won't answer,\" explains Sam. \"The homeless don't believe that anyone would do anything for them. They think you want to steal their sleeping bags. They think you're the police.\" </p> <p>There is a medieval quality about street life here - not just in the way these people live, but in the brute intensity of their fears: money, sex and death, in that order. </p> <p>It is standard for somebody to come on to Sam's wife when they are out begging. \"'If you let your girlfriend suck me off, I'll give you a fiver.' You get that one about every half hour,' Sam says. The other day, a man offered her a flat. \"Don't mind about the rent,\" he said. \"Just move in and we'll come to some arrangement.\" </p> <p>Another popular joke is to pull out a handful of money and give only a penny. People frequently shout abuse, and sometimes Sam argues back. He and his wife cannot get work because no employer will take them without an address. They cannot get an address because landlords demand a deposit and a month's payment in advance, whereas housing benefit - for which they would be eligible - does not cover a deposit and pays only two weeks in arrears. Now they are also finding it difficult to beg, because the government has decreed that begging, too, is bad for the homeless. </p> <p>Across the street, by the city's new \u00a33m swimming pool, is another multi-storey car park. We find nobody there, but we do see some clothes and a book. These belong to Sally, missing for about a week. Nobody knows where she is, but the rumour is that she has been taken down to London to be a prostitute. Apparently, she was nice looking. </p> <p>As we walk back through the city, we pass a fight brewing among eight rough sleepers in the bus shelter. One is accusing the others of stealing his bike. Sam tries to calm them down, because two are his friends and the man accusing them is supposed to have contacts with Jamaican gangsters. He and another person - I keep well back, so I don't see who - start trying to stab each other with syringes, while a third takes a drink of lighter fluid and threatens to burn the accuser's face off. Eventually, Sam's devotion to his friends pays off, and the rumpus ceases. </p> <p>As we walk away, he says: \"It is a rough old world out there, mate. There's the world that other people survive in and there's this world. That's why we need winter shelters, to keep the weaker ones alive.\" </p> <p>But Cambridge is adamant that it will toe the New Labour line: providing the homeless with warmth and a place to lie down off the streets encourages them to remain homeless. </p> <p>What are the options? One approach, used in Brighton, is a \"rolling shelter\". An existing hostel sets aside a certain number of beds, which are made available to rough sleepers on the coldest days. But the Cambridge hostels are full every night. </p> <p>In Manchester, charity workers have discovered they can get money for winter accommodation, provided the homeless are not allowed to lie down while they are there. It's what the Victorians used to call a \"penny sit up\": for a penny, somebody living on the streets could sit indoors on a wooden bench. In Cambridge, though, there is no money even for this ploy. </p> <p>Another rough sleeper died the other day: Taz, a middle-aged alcoholic. Nobody knew much about him - he'd been in Cambridge a little over a week - but the word is that he had come to the city because he expected to find shelter during the cold months. His life ended down by the bus station, on the first night of the winter frosts. </p> <p>Sam and I finish our walks at about 2.30am, after checking the pavilion by the tennis courts and the toilets next to the DSS offices and recycling bins. \"What would you do if you got the van fixed?\" I ask, as he clambers back inside and slides beneath his thin duvet. The material is damp, because of condensation dripping from the roof. \"I'm a Romani,\" Sam says. \"I know about seasonal work. I'd go to Penzance to pick flowers.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Alexander Masters is a freelance journalist whose clients include a homelessness charity in Cambridge </p> <p><strong> Official line: It's time to move on</strong><br> <strong> David Brindle</strong><br></p> <p> Naisha Polaine, Cambridge council's housing needs manager, vehemently denies any deliberate undercounting of numbers sleeping rough in the city. When the October count yielded a figure of 18, she says, local homelessness charities put the true total no higher than 25. </p> <p>\"There is no political line in terms of doing what central government wants us to do,\" insists Polaine. \"The local politicians in Cambridge say they want us to sort out street homelessness - and that's just what we are trying to do.\" </p> <p>Last winter, the government provided \u00a3280,000 for a 28-bed winter shelter that was open for four months. \"We know that 50% of those bed spaces were used by people who came specifically to Cambridge because of the shelter,\" says Polaine. This winter, the council has spent \u00a320,000 on move-on accommodation to free 21 beds in year-round hostels, available from next Monday. \"To me, that's trying to make best use of public resources, it's trying to be inventive and to find different solutions.\" </p> <p>Polaine, who says she has \u00a3250,000 \"new money\" from the government to help the street homeless, dismisses accusations of heartlessness. \"I'm trying to help our people who are the most entrenched rough sleepers,\" she says. \"There are seven or 10 of them, and I know their names.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Alexander Masters is a freelance journalist whose clients include a homelessness charity in Cambridge</p>",

The long awaited rural white paper promises a five-point plan including measures to protect the countryside and give parish councils wide-ranging powers to increase the choice available to rural communities. Deputy prime minister John Prescott told the Commons: \"The white paper is about tackling the real issues that matter to people - jobs, housing, health, education and transport - and giving them a real say in what is happening in their town or village.\" In a move that signals a shift away from the traditional rural policy pre-occupation with agriculture and countryside issues, ministers have used the white paper to tackle a wide range of social problems faced by the countryside. Among these are proposals to improve rural life through a set of minimum targets for all public services, including schools and transport. The paper also proposes an injection of extra money into rural development, including a \u00a337m fund to regenerate market towns, \u00a3270m of investment to retain threatened local post offices, and a range of funds to improve rural transport. It sets measures to protect community services such as shops and pubs from the possibility of closure - they could have their business rates slashed by half, and could also benefit from a \u00a315m fund designed to promote local services that benefit rural people. The white paper attempts to tackle rural housing needs, promising to provide 9,000 affordable homes a year across all rural districts and using the planning system to secure a higher level of affordable housing in towns and villages. Shire councils may gain more power to help deal with local housing needs with extra money raised by scrapping the 50% council tax discount on second homes. Ministers say they will consult on the proposals. The government proposes to protect the countryside through legislation to maintain commons, and a \u00a335m fund for improving the environment. The white paper also suggests a range of measures to put rural issues at the heart of the policy-making process. These include a new rural advocate to argue the countryside's case within government, an annual report from the Countryside Agency setting out the impact of major new policies, and new rural sounding boards at the national and regional level.

The people of Burngreave, in Sheffield, have decided to let the teenagers help choose the community's representatives on the body that will decide how up to \u00a350m is spent on the area under a New Deal regeneration scheme. </p> <p>Government guidelines make clear that schemes benefiting from the New Deal for communities must be \"community-driven and inclusive\" - and Burngreave has taken the civil servants at their word. </p> <p>At a public meeting to decide how the community elections would be held, it was overwhelmingly agreed that the electoral register would not be the deciding factor in setting the franchise. The voting age would be lowered from 18 to 15 and, in addition, people not on the electoral roll - whether by oversight, choice or because they might be seeking asylum - would still be allowed to participate in the January postal ballot. </p> <p>The move has not been without difficulties. A spokesman for the Burngreave New Deal project says the regional government office was initially \"highly sceptical\" of the idea. But the meeting voted overwhelmingly to go ahead and the Electoral Reform Society, which is organising the ballot through Electoral Reform Services, its commercial arm, was \"positively enthusiastic\". </p> <p>The elected representatives will join others from Sheffield council, statutory agencies, the voluntary sector and the city's business community. No previous New Deal ballot has extended to 15 and 16-year-olds, but young people aged 17 were allowed to both vote and stand in the recent election on the Ocean estate in Tower Hamlets, east London - with a 17-year-old, Shahama Begum, elected female youth representative. </p> <p>The Burngreave election will be based on a special electoral roll, comprising all residents over age 15 irrespective of nationality. Community research workers are assembling the register in collaboration with ERS. </p> <p>The massive investment that New Deal will bring to this deprived area of Sheffield is long overdue. More than 40% of households in the district are claiming income support - double the city's average. One in five is out of work and 30% of theunemployed have never had a job. Life expectancy is relatively short and the suicide rate high. Burngreave also has a reputation for drugs, shootings and illegal drinking dens. But the vast majority of the multicultural community is law abiding and knows the district desperately needs the help that New Deal can bring. </p> <p>No one knows it more than the young. The district has almost 1,300 people between 15 and 24, representing 14% of the local population. Sixteen-year-old Aman Quassim believes the local environment should be a top priority. \"There must be improvements,\" she says. \"A cleaner environment is essential, as is better housing. People deserve far better than they have. It's very good that we have been given the vote, and myself and my brother [Samia, also 16] will definitely use it to try and win these things for Burngreave.\" </p> <p>The case for a cleaner environment is echoed by Mark Keyworth, 15, who says: \"The whole area needs cleaning up and keeping in shape. We want a better place to live in and these elections give us the chance to voice our opinions. Now we'll have to wait and see what the candidates have to say.\" </p> <p>Ali Dirir, 16, says he was excited to learn he is to have a vote. \"It's a big step. I'll have to find out where each candidate stands and I'll no doubt discuss the issues with my family. Young people here need better facilities, especially sporting facilities. That would make a big difference to young people in Burngreave.\" </p> <p>All three of these teenagers attend Fir Vale, the comprehensive school covering the district. Its recently announced 6% improvement in GCSE results is an indicator that it is turning itself round after being designated a government \"fresh start\" school two years ago. </p> <p>Hugh Howe is head of Fir Vale. He believes the decision to lower the voting age to 15 for the elections is an important step for the community. \"As a fresh start school, we've been given the opportunity to move ourselves forward and we're making good progress,\" he says. \"It's good to see another investment coming, in the shape of New Deal. If you like, there's a fresh start for the community as well as the school. There are new funds, new opportunities and new ways of bringing democracy together. People are being given a say in how the New Deal money will be used - especially the 15, 16 and 17-year-olds.\" </p> <p>The school sees itself as a focal point in the community, and learning about the democratic process is an important part of Fir Vale's curriculum, according to Howe. \"The students learn about citizenship. They've been to the city's council chamber and to parliament. We have taught them how to be politically literate. They understand the voting process. </p> <p>\"They never dreamed that while still at school they would be part of that voting process.

      "body": "<p>The Dick Lane estate stands three miles east of Bradford in the suburb of Tyersal. A concentration of 620 properties, it began as traditional, 30s, council-style housing and expanded in the 70s to include flats and bungalows. More than \u00a32.5m is being pumped into the area to modernise homes, improve the environment and fund youth and community work. Yet the landlord is about to bring in the demolition squad. </p> <p>This radical step is the result of a new approach that the landlord, the William Sutton Trust, is taking to tackle low demand and other housing issues across its 70 estates. In all, it is to bulldoze 418 homes, including 14 one-bedroom flats on Dick Lane. </p> <p>The trust is one of the oldest housing providers in the country. Since its inception a century ago, it has been known for a somewhat paternalistic approach to its task of housing some of the poorest people in society. Now, though, that is about to change with the introduction of what it is calling its \"property reinvestment strategy model\" (Prism). </p> <p>The model has been designed to enable the trust to target its repairs and modernisation expenditure on estates that are sustainable - rather then leave it ploughing money into homes that may end up lying empty in five years' time. </p> <p>Low demand is plaguing many social landlords, notably in the north and the west midlands. Nationally, about 92,000 housing association homes (8% of the total) are reported to be unpopular for reasons ranging from poor reputation, and rising crime, to low housing costs that enable tenants to buy their own homes or rent privately. </p> <p>Until now, many social landlords have been reluctant to acknowledge that certain neighbourhoods cannot be regenerated by their efforts alone, and might be irretrievable. But proposals in the government's housing green paper to link future capital funding to housing demand have focused minds, with some associations starting to consider demolition of certain homes on individual estates. In Newcastle upon Tyne, North British housing association has already demolished 50 homes, just three years after they were built, and the city council is proposing a 6,000 reduction in property numbers across the city. </p> <p>What is new about the Prism model - officially launched today as a management tool for other housing associations to use - is its strategic approach across an entire housing stock, not just those pockets currently suffering low demand. </p> <p>\"For some years the trust had recognised the potential significance of changing demand and its impact on stock reinvestment,\" says Mike Morris, trust chief executive. \"We felt that our properties, where it was becoming increasingly difficult to sustain tenancies, reflected an irrevocable decline of a local area and we needed an holistic way of deciding how to prioritise estates for stock reinvestment - and to decide in some areas whether that reinvestment was appropriate. Prism allows us to do this by comparing estates, like for like.\" </p> <p>Prism is a four-stage process. The first two stages identified \"at risk\" estates. This was done by piecing together a social economic profile of an estate over the past year - looking at issues such as housing demand, unemployment, and the local authority's investment in the area - followed by a five-year profile.

      "bodyText": "The Dick Lane estate stands three miles east of Bradford in the suburb of Tyersal. A concentration of 620 properties, it began as traditional, 30s, council-style housing and expanded in the 70s to include flats and bungalows. More than \u00a32.5m is being pumped into the area to modernise homes, improve the environment and fund youth and community work. Yet the landlord is about to bring in the demolition squad. This radical step is the result of a new approach that the landlord, the William Sutton Trust, is taking to tackle low demand and other housing issues across its 70 estates. In all, it is to bulldoze 418 homes, including 14 one-bedroom flats on Dick Lane. The trust is one of the oldest housing providers in the country. Since its inception a century ago, it has been known for a somewhat paternalistic approach to its task of housing some of the poorest people in society. Now, though, that is about to change with the introduction of what it is calling its \"property reinvestment strategy model\" (Prism). The model has been designed to enable the trust to target its repairs and modernisation expenditure on estates that are sustainable - rather then leave it ploughing money into homes that may end up lying empty in five years' time. Low demand is plaguing many social landlords, notably in the north and the west midlands. Nationally, about 92,000 housing association homes (8% of the total) are reported to be unpopular for reasons ranging from poor reputation, and rising crime, to low housing costs that enable tenants to buy their own homes or rent privately. Until now, many social landlords have been reluctant to acknowledge that certain neighbourhoods cannot be regenerated by their efforts alone, and might be irretrievable. But proposals in the government's housing green paper to link future capital funding to housing demand have focused minds, with some associations starting to consider demolition of certain homes on individual estates. In Newcastle upon Tyne, North British housing association has already demolished 50 homes, just three years after they were built, and the city council is proposing a 6,000 reduction in property numbers across the city. What is new about the Prism model - officially launched today as a management tool for other housing associations to use - is its strategic approach across an entire housing stock, not just those pockets currently suffering low demand. \"For some years the trust had recognised the potential significance of changing demand and its impact on stock reinvestment,\" says Mike Morris, trust chief executive. \"We felt that our properties, where it was becoming increasingly difficult to sustain tenancies, reflected an irrevocable decline of a local area and we needed an holistic way of deciding how to prioritise estates for stock reinvestment - and to decide in some areas whether that reinvestment was appropriate. Prism allows us to do this by comparing estates, like for like.\" Prism is a four-stage process. The first two stages identified \"at risk\" estates. This was done by piecing together a social economic profile of an estate over the past year - looking at issues such as housing demand, unemployment, and the local authority's investment in the area - followed by a five-year profile. Each issue was given a benchmark against which to determine risk. Although some statistics cover a whole ward, not neighbourhoods, the model was able to identify 19 \"at risk\" estates. They went forward to a third stage, where reinvestment proposals were put forward in the light of the estate's profile and subjected to a cost/benefit analysis, taking on board non-monetary, \"social\" costs and benefits. Those proposals were then put to tenants and other stakeholders, including the council, to agree a preferred option. The two-year process across William Sutton's 15,700 houses and flats threw up a number of surprises, not least the identification of two of the trust's London estates as at risk, because of crime and anti-social behaviour, and the highlighting of a further 10 estates in Milton Keynes and Bedford as borderline cases.

      "body": "<p>When an 11-year-old boy sticks his hand up in class and asks, in sweet but not quite convincing innocence, what a condom is, how should you react? Do you ignore him, squirm with embarrassment or give him a ticking off for being cheeky? </p> <p>If you are Chris Mayer, a school nurse in Chester, you might be a little surprised at the question. But you would certainly encourage the boy and his classmates to chat without embarrassment about sex and body changes. </p> <p>It is this frankness that will tonight see Mayer, 32, collect the community nurse of the year title in the annual awards run by Nursing Standard, the weekly magazine of the Royal College of Nursing. The judges were impressed with Mayer's commitment to increasing the knowledge of puberty among younger boys - an often-neglected group when teachers are planning their lessons on the vagaries of the adolescent body. </p> <p>Mayer, something of a rarity as a male school nurse, works for the Countess of Chester NHS trust in primary and high schools in the Chester area. He has written Boys Talk, a leaflet about puberty for 10 to 12-year-old boys, and Let's Talk About Sex, which, with a linked website, enables older boys and girls to find information about contraception, sexually-transmitted diseases and relationships. </p> <p>Before going into schools two years ago, Mayer was a paediatric nurse. But he wanted to get involved in health promotion and was surprised - and concerned - at the lack of information on puberty and sex for younger boys. The Boys Talk leaflet was born, dealing with such sensitive and taboo issues as involuntary erections, wet dreams and body hair. It remains the basis of his work with the younger age group. </p> <p>\"We usually do it in the last term before they go on to high school,\" he says. \"If the weather's good, we go outside and sit under a tree. I tell them that at the moment they're the biggest and the oldest at school but when they get to high school it's going to be different. We talk about the changes that are happening to the big boys. </p> <p>\"Most of them are a bit shy to ask questions and we don't really have a discussion like I do with the older children. Some of them have heard about puberty and what's likely to happen, but if they haven't, that's OK. It's good to know that they might be a little bit prepared.\" </p> <p>Sandra Rote, one of the award judges and a health visitor of many years' experience, agrees that younger boys often miss out and that the bewildering changes puberty brings can come as a shock. </p> <p>\"What impressed me about Chris's entry was that it targeted a group that is often neglected in health education and health promotion,\" she says. \"There's a lot of information out there for women and young girls, but there's very little for boys. </p> <p>\"I think some of it is to do with being a male in a particularly female workforce - school nurses are predominantly women. Chris has come at the lessons with that viewpoint and it shows. School nurses can learn a lot from him.\" </p> <p>Government guidelines on sex education stipulate that primary school children should not be taught about sex. Mayer is keen to work within the guidelines, but if a child asks an awkward question he cannot ignore it. </p> <p>He says: \"Last year a lad said to me: 'What's a condom for?' And he was only 11! He threw the question at me as if he knew the answer. I asked if anyone else knew and one lad put his hand up and said: 'It stops girls getting pregnant and boys getting Aids.' I was amazed.\" </p> <p>Chatting to younger children about sex is a minefield, as Leeds school nurse Sue Brady found to her peril. She became a cause celebre six years ago when a 10-year-old child asked her a question about oral sex which she answered as honestly as she could. One of the children's parents found out, complained to the school and Brady was headline news - reducing media pundits and politicians to near apoplexy. </p> <p>Things may have calmed down a little since then, but Mayer is aware of the need to tread carefully. \"In one of my high schools there's a parent from Holland, where the whole ethos and approach to sex education is different,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't have a problem discussing drugs and contraception with 11-year-olds, even though I don't because of the guidelines. Because you talk about something it doesn't mean they're going to go off and do it.\" </p> <p>Generally, parents are eager for their children to learn about puberty, he says. \"Most schools send a letter out a couple of weeks before, saying that I'm going to be talking about puberty and if they want to take their child out of the class they can. I've never had any parent do that. We have a parent day where I show them the video and tell them about what's going to happen. I think some of them might be relieved that I'm discussing this with their kids, rather than them having to do it.\" </p> <p>As he collects his prize this evening at the Caf\u00e9 Royal in London, Mayer hopes he is setting an example for other school nurses to follow. \"Now I've won, I would like to get more people doing what I do,\" he says. \"What I'm trying to get across to other school nurses is that it's not that hard to teach children about these things. It's actually really good fun.\"</p>",

Mencap wants to see other voluntary organisations recruiting people with learning disabilities, but acknowledges they are likely to need extra help in the early stages, and some special consideration throughout. Going to such trouble may, however, be a small price to pay for the added value a volunteer with learning disabilities can bring. \u0095 Further information about Mencap's family adviser service from 020-7454 0454",

It is an attempt to answer the question: \"Is this organisation doing the right things in the right way?\". And the point is to get the answer from the people who matter - those affected by its operations. </p> <p>Some in the business world have attempted to turn the increased scrutiny back on those who put pressure on them, asking about the accountability of organisations like Greenpeace.

The report, Charitable Trust?, concludes that this means of scrutinising social impacts is a valuable addition to voluntary sector management across this range of size and activity. </p> <p>The report is published by the New Economics Foundation, the think-tank behind social auditing, and the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo). Stephen Bubb, the latter's chief executive, says: \"In time, social audits should become as natural as reporting in the financial area.\" </p> <p>But they should be more valuable. Financial reports and audits are necessary, but tell little about an organisation's effectiveness. Social reports, on the other hand, should reveal the extent to which objectives are being fulfilled - and whether they are the right objectives. </p> <p>The process begins by identifying stakeholder groups - those involved in or affected by an organisation, such as employees, suppliers and customers. These groups identify key issues and the indicators to measure performance, and then provide their assessment. Thus social auditing is a judgment by those an organisation affects, on criteria they have specified. </p> <p>The process itself is usually carried out by the organisation, but independently audited. That external involvement can be key to ensuring an open, honest dialogue, and a comprehensive report back to stakeholders. </p> <p>For a company like Shell, the point is to answer criticisms of its behaviour. In successive social reports (which have won awards for their thoroughness and innovation) the oil giant has mapped out a path to social and environmental responsibility and presented measures of its progress along that route. But few charities face such controversies, so why subject themselves to this process? </p> <p>Bubb says there is no reason why charities should not be subject to the same scrutiny as businesses. \"It's not good enough for charities to say, 'Everything we do is fine.' There are some funny old practices going on out there. We should accept the same standards as the private sector.\" </p> <p>He acknowledges concerns about this becoming an added bureaucratic burden, when it is already hard enough for most organisations to raise adequate non-project funding. But he believes an effective audit model can be developed for organisations of all sizes, and says there are good management reasons for adding a social audit to the financial one. \"The main benefits are more professionalism in the sector, accountability, and analysing objectives and aspirations,\" he argues. </p> <p>The organisations involved in the pilot project hoped to deal with these issues - in many cases, as part of an approach to quality management. \"To expand our approach to quality and to measure the social impact our services have on our client group\" was one objective. \"We wanted to make sure our services were addressing the needs of our stakeholders,\" said another participant. </p> <p>Steve Cranston, of the Arts Factory in the Rhondda, south Wales, says the community service organisation aims to carry out a social audit every year. Dialogue with stakeholders is an important element for Cranston, but so is the involvement of independent external auditors, which gives the process credibility. \"We want a genuine, open, honest dialogue. We really want people's views,\" he says. \"This is not a PR exercise.\" </p> <p>Engaging in this kind of process for the first time was tough for most of the organisations involved. Some were nervous about stakeholders' ability to define realistic targets. Some stakeholders felt overwhelmed and were reluctant to be engaged. Most organisations had never tried to measure their performance against specific indicators. </p> <p>Resources - financial and people - were also a big issue for many participants. Sense West, the Birmingham-based region of deaf-blind charity Sense, found it could only achieve part of what it set out to do. It did not manage to include the service users - the primary stakeholders - in dialogue, and the charity felt too little time was devoted to tailoring the process and gaining commitment from those who administered the questionnaires. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Sense found that, because of the involvement of an external consultant, \"the feedback was more frank and comprehensive than that gained in other audits\".

The quayside car parks and shops are almost empty. On calm days, the Solent laps the harbour walls, but in bad weather - and there is much of it - gardens well inland are lashed by the sea, winds batter the downs, and the islanders and their sea defences are both severely tested. </p> <p>They face worse weather still. In the next 100 years, say scientists, the Isle of Wight could become the Isles of Wight, as land becomes regularly, even permanently, overwhelmed by water. Without strengthening coastal defences, the river Yar will severely flood, cutting off the far western tip of the island. Sea level rise could lead to loss of beaches, yet more major flooding, and the loss of environmentally sensitive areas. </p> <p>Angela Mawle, who works for the Isle of Wight council, says the inhabitants understand the uniqueness of the island and are anxious not to lose it. As a first step, the council has contributed money and masses of data to help quantify and map the \"ecological footprint\" of the island's 125,000 inhabitants to see how sustainable their lifestyles are in global and local terms. It has involved looking at the islanders' energy consumption, waste, transport habits, food and drink imports and exports, the fossil fuels they burn, how they use water and all the other impacts the inhabitants have on the island's natural resources. </p> <p>Ecological footprinting was devel oped by William Rees and Mathis Wackernagel at the University of British Columbia in the early 90s. It is increasingly seen as a way to show people the impact they have on both the local and global environment, but so far very few full studies have been done on large communities. The island study is one of the largest and most advanced of its kind. </p> <p>The best way to understand ecological footprinting is to imagine every person on the planet having their own \"earthshare\", or area needed to live off. This is calculated by dividing the amount of productive land and sea worldwide by the global population. This \"share\" is taken to represent the maximum sustainable use of resources per person. Recent studies have estimated this to be about 1.9 hectares - or just under the size of two football pitches - per person. However, the current global average demand is a very unsustainable 2.28 hectares. </p> <p> For the Isle of Wight, Oxford-based sustainability experts Best Foot Forward and Imperial College, London, took vast amounts of data about the resources used by the islanders and calculated the area needed to provide them. </p> <p>They estimated average car kilometres per person (7,035 per year, compared with the south-east England average of 11,300km a year per person), the average number of black binbags of rubbish produced by each islander (40 each, adding up to over 5m across the island), the land resources required for the Isle of Wight's consumption of alcohol (5,074 hectares), washing powder (3,441 hectares), paper (18,357 hectares), furniture and carpets (9,892), and so on. </p> <p>The \"footprints\" for fossil fuels and renewable energies were based both on their direct use of land and also the \"forested\" land required to reabsorb any carbon emitted. Sustainability was then assessed by comparing the footprint with the amount of land available on the island and with the global \"earthshare\". </p> <p>The figures were revealing. The Isle of Wight consumed 753,368 tonnes of materials in 1998-99, or 5.8 tonnes per person. More than half of this was in the form of bulk stone and aggregates, of which two-thirds was imported from the mainland. Meanwhile, they sent 33,337 tonnes (250kg per capita) of domestic waste to landfill. Some 43% of that was diverted away from landfill by being recycled, composted or incinerated for waste recovery - much more than the national average of 18%. But a further 108,951 tonnes (838kg per person) of commercial waste was collected, of which 97% went to landfill. When it came to transport, the island was seen to be very dependent on cars: 71% of all passenger kilo metres travelled were by car, compared to 0.7% by bus, or 7.7% by ferry. The total footprint for the Isle of Wight, combining figures for the use and production of materials, food, passenger transport, energy, freight transport, built land and water, was calculated as 648,808 hectares, on an island with a capacity of just 219,106 hectares. This meant the islanders' footprint was 4.47 hectares per resident. </p> <p>If everyone in the world consumed as much as the residents of the Isle of Wight, the report says, we would need just under 2.5 earths to support the lifestyle. Put another way, if the Isle of Wight was to become self-sufficient, while maintaining current lifestyles, it would need to be about 2.25 times its actual size - or the population would need to reduce consumption by 56%. </p> <p>This figure is slightly better than the figure for UK resource use as a whole, which would require just over 2.5 planets to sustain it. And if the population of the globe lived in the manner of the affluent residents of Oxfordshire, we would need nearly four planets. </p> <p>If we are to counter global warming and many other environmental ills, it is widely accepted that northern countries, especially, must shrink their footprints. How can that be done? The report suggests regional self-sufficiency is a start and, in the case of the island, goods produced there should be consumed there as far as possible. It advises the use of CFLs (compact fluorescent lightbulbs), the insulation of houses, the buying of energy-efficient appliances. </p> <p>The island could also profit by exploiting its considerable natural potential for renewable energy - wind farms (offshore or onshore) could be combined with land used for agriculture, some of the arable and pasture land on the island could be used for the growing and use of biomass energy crops, and businesses and homes could switch to solar photo-voltaic electricity generation. However, a combination of better waste recovery, energy efficiency and renewables could reduce the islanders' footprint by almost half a hectare, or 10%, the report says. </p> <p> \u0095 Island State, An Ecological Footprint of the Isle of Wight, can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.bestfootforward.com\">www.bestfootforward.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>This is National Tree Week and all across Britain tens of thousands of spades, from Haringey to Hampshire and Humberside, are stabbing into muddy, saturated soil in a world record attempt to increase our tree cover. With up to a million trees expected to be planted, these schemes are an attempt to involve people in local woodland creation. </p> <p>More trees are valuable to local communities, wildlife and the environment. But there is a cultural and spiritual dimension which is just as important, although this reverence for trees is now largely confined to old ones. </p> <p>Take, for instance, when the royal oak at Boscobel in Shropshire was split in half by the recent gales. The wind knifes over the plain, between the Clee and Wrekin hills, and the first thing it hits when it reaches the edge of the high plateau is this tree. </p> <p>It is the tree that launched a thousand pub signs; the tree that on September 6, 1651, King Charles II famously hid in. Now a huge gash exposes the old tree's dark innards and the wind has got into its cracks. Huge branches have crashed to the ground, but it still points a craggily defiant finger at the sky. </p> <p>In fact, this is probably not the original tree in which King Charles hid, but a young pretender which grew nearby - the original having become furniture and snuff boxes after snuffing it itself in 1706, as recorded by John Evelyn. </p> <p>No matter; the legend is scratched deep into the bones of Britishness and the tree stands for something, even if we're not sure exactly what. In reality, this oak stands for itself, for all oaks and for the wonderful and beautiful struggle of life in a world of powerful indifference. </p> <p>Next to the royal oak is an offspring planted in 1951 to continue the tradition. Valerie Tooby remembers: \"I went to the planting ceremony when I was a child and the Chelsea pensioners were there. It was wonderful.\" She has seen it grow over the years.

      "bodyText": "This is National Tree Week and all across Britain tens of thousands of spades, from Haringey to Hampshire and Humberside, are stabbing into muddy, saturated soil in a world record attempt to increase our tree cover. With up to a million trees expected to be planted, these schemes are an attempt to involve people in local woodland creation. More trees are valuable to local communities, wildlife and the environment. But there is a cultural and spiritual dimension which is just as important, although this reverence for trees is now largely confined to old ones. Take, for instance, when the royal oak at Boscobel in Shropshire was split in half by the recent gales. The wind knifes over the plain, between the Clee and Wrekin hills, and the first thing it hits when it reaches the edge of the high plateau is this tree. It is the tree that launched a thousand pub signs; the tree that on September 6, 1651, King Charles II famously hid in. Now a huge gash exposes the old tree's dark innards and the wind has got into its cracks. Huge branches have crashed to the ground, but it still points a craggily defiant finger at the sky. In fact, this is probably not the original tree in which King Charles hid, but a young pretender which grew nearby - the original having become furniture and snuff boxes after snuffing it itself in 1706, as recorded by John Evelyn. No matter; the legend is scratched deep into the bones of Britishness and the tree stands for something, even if we're not sure exactly what. In reality, this oak stands for itself, for all oaks and for the wonderful and beautiful struggle of life in a world of powerful indifference. Next to the royal oak is an offspring planted in 1951 to continue the tradition. Valerie Tooby remembers: \"I went to the planting ceremony when I was a child and the Chelsea pensioners were there. It was wonderful.\" She has seen it grow over the years. This oak too was split in half by the same storm. All the trees battered by the storms have a story, and many of the trees planted this week will, in their turn, enter our lives. The veracity of our myths seems less important than the trees which embody them, especially when we see them broken and twisted. But there are new myths to make and new trees to hide them in. Although old trees are irreplaceable, the new ones being planted this week need a similarly powerful purchase on our culture if they are to matter in ways which reach beyond world record attempts and environmental gestures. \u0095 Paul Evans is a Guardian country diarist For details of the tree planting campaign, visit www.treecouncil.org.uk or tel: 020 7828 9928. \u0095 For information on Trees of Time and Place visit www.totap.org.uk (0345-078 139)",

      "body": "<p>An early election was announced in Israel last night by the prime minister, Ehud Barak, short-circuiting an opposition plan to shut down his government in stages.</p> <p>Harangued by the Israeli right for being too soft on the Palestinians during the past two months of undeclared war, pilloried from abroad for using excessive force, and deserted by even his coalition partners, Mr Barak was under siege. The election call is his breakout attempt.</p> <p>Last night, after an uproarious day in the Israeli parliament, the knesset, he was left clinging to just one thing: the chance to dictate the timing of his government's exit.</p> <p>In a defiant speech given at very short notice, Mr Barak said: \"I am not afraid of elections. If you say you want elec tions, I say: Let there be elections, for prime minister, and for the knesset.\"</p> <p>In the parliamentary corridors last night, predictions were for a poll between March and May next year, with most leaning towards the latter date.</p> <p>For Mr Barak, who last week hit his lowest point yet in opinion polls, the timing is crucial. Despite two months of violence, in which more than 280 people, mainly Palestinian, have been killed, Israel's prime minister continues to believe that he can reach a peace agreement with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.</p> <p>But by the standards of the past weeks, recent violence appeared to be ebbing. The past week has seen the start of tentative efforts by Israeli and Palestinian diplomats and security officials to resurrect various broken ceasefires.</p> <p>Israeli newspapers reported yesterday that Mr Barak was preparing a new proposal for an interim peace agreement with the Palestinians.</p> <p>The proposal is a modest affair - especially for a prime minister who had a landslide election victory in May last year, promising to storm the citadels of peace.</p> <p>It is limited to transferring areas of the West Bank to Palestinian control, and securing Israeli recognition of a Palestinian state, and does not touch on the most contentious issue: the status of Jerusalem.</p> <p>Israel has yet to approach the Palestinians with the proposal. But Nabil Shaath, a senior Arab negotiator, said after last night's election announcement: \"Barak still has six months until the coming elections, and if he wants, he can stop his aggression and adopt a new policy that will enable him to go to his people with progress in the peace process.\"</p> <p>That is clearly what Mr Barak is calculating. The latest opinion polls show he would lose a contest against the Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, and the former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu.</p> <p>But with a peace pact Mr Barak would have a chance. Even so, the delay could also afford Mr Netanyahu precious time to make a political comeback and wrest the Likud leadership from Mr Sharon. He would be a tough opponent.</p> <p>The hardline Mr Sharon is widely blamed for igniting the Palestinian uprising with his provocative visit to the holiest Muslim site in Jerusalem on September 28.</p> <p>As the casualties have mounted since then, he has tried to reap maximum gains from this calculated act. But last night Mr Sharon was clearly discomfited by the Barak election call, which put in prospect a leadership challenge against him in the Likud. One ageing ex-general, Mr Sharon, appeared plainly outwitted by another, Mr Barak.</p> <p>It was Likud that precipitated yesterday's announcement, tabling and passing bills for early dissolution of parliament. These could eventually have brought down the curtain on the government.</p> <p>The stalemate at last July's Camp David peace summit seems to have started Mr Barak's fall from popular grace, and the related descent into violence: the collapse of these talks appears to have shattered Palestinian confidence in Mr Barak's sincerity in negotiating peace, and antagonised his rightwing Israeli opponents, who accused him of sacrificing old Jerusalem.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "An early election was announced in Israel last night by the prime minister, Ehud Barak, short-circuiting an opposition plan to shut down his government in stages. Harangued by the Israeli right for being too soft on the Palestinians during the past two months of undeclared war, pilloried from abroad for using excessive force, and deserted by even his coalition partners, Mr Barak was under siege. The election call is his breakout attempt. Last night, after an uproarious day in the Israeli parliament, the knesset, he was left clinging to just one thing: the chance to dictate the timing of his government's exit. In a defiant speech given at very short notice, Mr Barak said: \"I am not afraid of elections. If you say you want elec tions, I say: Let there be elections, for prime minister, and for the knesset.\" In the parliamentary corridors last night, predictions were for a poll between March and May next year, with most leaning towards the latter date. For Mr Barak, who last week hit his lowest point yet in opinion polls, the timing is crucial. Despite two months of violence, in which more than 280 people, mainly Palestinian, have been killed, Israel's prime minister continues to believe that he can reach a peace agreement with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. But by the standards of the past weeks, recent violence appeared to be ebbing. The past week has seen the start of tentative efforts by Israeli and Palestinian diplomats and security officials to resurrect various broken ceasefires. Israeli newspapers reported yesterday that Mr Barak was preparing a new proposal for an interim peace agreement with the Palestinians. The proposal is a modest affair - especially for a prime minister who had a landslide election victory in May last year, promising to storm the citadels of peace. It is limited to transferring areas of the West Bank to Palestinian control, and securing Israeli recognition of a Palestinian state, and does not touch on the most contentious issue: the status of Jerusalem. Israel has yet to approach the Palestinians with the proposal. But Nabil Shaath, a senior Arab negotiator, said after last night's election announcement: \"Barak still has six months until the coming elections, and if he wants, he can stop his aggression and adopt a new policy that will enable him to go to his people with progress in the peace process.\" That is clearly what Mr Barak is calculating. The latest opinion polls show he would lose a contest against the Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, and the former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. But with a peace pact Mr Barak would have a chance. Even so, the delay could also afford Mr Netanyahu precious time to make a political comeback and wrest the Likud leadership from Mr Sharon. He would be a tough opponent. The hardline Mr Sharon is widely blamed for igniting the Palestinian uprising with his provocative visit to the holiest Muslim site in Jerusalem on September 28. As the casualties have mounted since then, he has tried to reap maximum gains from this calculated act. But last night Mr Sharon was clearly discomfited by the Barak election call, which put in prospect a leadership challenge against him in the Likud. One ageing ex-general, Mr Sharon, appeared plainly outwitted by another, Mr Barak. It was Likud that precipitated yesterday's announcement, tabling and passing bills for early dissolution of parliament. These could eventually have brought down the curtain on the government. The stalemate at last July's Camp David peace summit seems to have started Mr Barak's fall from popular grace, and the related descent into violence: the collapse of these talks appears to have shattered Palestinian confidence in Mr Barak's sincerity in negotiating peace, and antagonised his rightwing Israeli opponents, who accused him of sacrificing old Jerusalem.

      "bodyText": "The government's compromise deal for the partial privatisation of the air traffic control system (Nats) won a 97-vote Commons majority last night, only to be bounced back to the Lords for a final showdown later today. Liberal Democrats joined Tory MPs in denouncing the government's last-minute concession to delay the Nats sale for three months as \"spin and nothing more than that\", in contrast to the seven-vote Lords majority to delay the partial sell-off until after the expected May general election. In a series of votes the Commons rejected the Lords amendment by 305 to 217, a majoirty of 88, votes and then endorsed the government compromise - designed to show that ministers \"are listening\" - by 302 to 205, a majority of 97. As in the Lords, where only three Labour peers held out this week, the Labour revolt lost support. But Labour's Gwyneth Dunwoody, chairman of the Commons transport select committee, warned that the government was \"made up of ordinary people who make mistakes. \"The partial privatisation of Nats is a mistake,\" she said. \"This is a core service for aviation. It is not something that can easily make a profit. \"Putting more and more planes into the sky is not an option.

The Liberal Democrat spokesman, Michael Moore, warned: \"The public sector could certainly find the funds and we believe it could underwrite this particular project.\" He added that the public distrusted the government on the issue. Last night's vote came as sources close to the bid revealed that one of the main bidding companies is proposing to replace 70% of the engineering staff with contract staff. The facilities management and support services company, Serco, is planning to sub-contract much of its engineering maintenance work, in much the same way as Railtrack. This could affect almost 1,000 of Nats engineering staff, who are strongly opposed to the move on safety grounds, as well as the threat to their jobs. Senior Nats staff have already threatened to resign if the bid goes ahead. They say that Serco is the least suited to the job, although it is known that it is one favoured by the government.

      "body": "<p>After a breathless cup tie and a flurry of thunderous tackles Sunderland muscled their way past Manchester United's second string with a penalty scored by Kevin Phillips when most of United's youngsters should have been tucked up in bed. </p> <p> By then they had lost one of their more experienced players, Dwight Yorke seeing red during normal time. It has left the United manager Sir Alex Ferguson with a nagging headache. Yorke will now miss Premiership matches against Aston Villa, Ipswich and Liverpool; the legacy of this match could cost him dear. </p> <p> Yet for 75 minutes United's youngsters strutted around, comfortable with the lead earned by Yorke's first-half goal. Then Julio Arca stooped low to head past Raimond van der Gouw and, in the final 15 minutes of normal time, all composure drained away. </p> <p> After seeing his side denied what Ferguson described as a \"stonewall penalty\", when Thomas Sorensen caught Jonathan Greening, Yorke lost his head. Desperately trying to atone for a heavy first touch, he lunged two-footed at Emerson Thome. The red card that followed prompted an outcry on United's bench; the striker's season of fits and starts will now incorporate a suspension. Thome hobbled off and will have a scan on his knee today. </p> <p> \"Dwight did go in high,\" said Ferguson. \"It's uncharacteristic for him and a more capable referee would have recognised as much. He got a lot of abuse from Thome all night and got no protection but now he'll miss three important games. With Andy Cole out, that presents us with a bit of a problem.\" </p> <p> In extra-time red mist descended as weary legs flew into increasingly fearsome challenges. The substitute Michael Stewart floored Alex Rae and was lucky to see only yellow before John O'Shea's tug on Phillips presented Sunderland with a penalty. The striker, without a goal since mid-October, dispatched the kick confidently to Van der Gouw's left. </p> <p> Then Danny Weber and David Healy hit the bar as Wearside held its breath. Peter Reid conceded: \"It was a tight one and we got the breaks.\" </p> <p> The night had started sombrely with a twice-taken minute's silence for Len Shackleton, Sunderland's leading post-war scorer, who died earlier in the day at 78. The clown prince would presumably have chuckled at the bizarre repetition, due to advertising slots on live television. </p> <p> The home side stuttered on to the offensive. United's reserves boasted the confident grace of their seniors, zipping passes in neat triangles. It was little surprise when Quinton Fortune's reverse pass sent Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sprinting forward after 31 minutes, the Norwegian squaring the ball for Yorke as he entered the area. Jody Craddock's tackle checked the striker's progress, the ball fell to Greening and, as he feigned to shoot, Yorke recovered to slam the ball into the top corner.

      "bodyText": "After a breathless cup tie and a flurry of thunderous tackles Sunderland muscled their way past Manchester United's second string with a penalty scored by Kevin Phillips when most of United's youngsters should have been tucked up in bed. By then they had lost one of their more experienced players, Dwight Yorke seeing red during normal time. It has left the United manager Sir Alex Ferguson with a nagging headache. Yorke will now miss Premiership matches against Aston Villa, Ipswich and Liverpool; the legacy of this match could cost him dear. Yet for 75 minutes United's youngsters strutted around, comfortable with the lead earned by Yorke's first-half goal. Then Julio Arca stooped low to head past Raimond van der Gouw and, in the final 15 minutes of normal time, all composure drained away. After seeing his side denied what Ferguson described as a \"stonewall penalty\", when Thomas Sorensen caught Jonathan Greening, Yorke lost his head. Desperately trying to atone for a heavy first touch, he lunged two-footed at Emerson Thome. The red card that followed prompted an outcry on United's bench; the striker's season of fits and starts will now incorporate a suspension. Thome hobbled off and will have a scan on his knee today. \"Dwight did go in high,\" said Ferguson. \"It's uncharacteristic for him and a more capable referee would have recognised as much. He got a lot of abuse from Thome all night and got no protection but now he'll miss three important games. With Andy Cole out, that presents us with a bit of a problem.\" In extra-time red mist descended as weary legs flew into increasingly fearsome challenges. The substitute Michael Stewart floored Alex Rae and was lucky to see only yellow before John O'Shea's tug on Phillips presented Sunderland with a penalty. The striker, without a goal since mid-October, dispatched the kick confidently to Van der Gouw's left. Then Danny Weber and David Healy hit the bar as Wearside held its breath. Peter Reid conceded: \"It was a tight one and we got the breaks.\" The night had started sombrely with a twice-taken minute's silence for Len Shackleton, Sunderland's leading post-war scorer, who died earlier in the day at 78. The clown prince would presumably have chuckled at the bizarre repetition, due to advertising slots on live television. The home side stuttered on to the offensive. United's reserves boasted the confident grace of their seniors, zipping passes in neat triangles. It was little surprise when Quinton Fortune's reverse pass sent Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sprinting forward after 31 minutes, the Norwegian squaring the ball for Yorke as he entered the area. Jody Craddock's tackle checked the striker's progress, the ball fell to Greening and, as he feigned to shoot, Yorke recovered to slam the ball into the top corner. Yet, with Wearmouth gnashing in frustration, the home revival was sparked by Phillips' 44th-minute curled shot which thumped against a post. Don Hutchison, Phillips and Arca so nearly restored parity before the teenage Argentine dived on to Phillips' cross to head home. Sunderland (4-4-2): Sorensen; Makin (McCann, h-t), Craddock, Thome (Varga, 87min), Gray; Hutchison, Rae, Williams, Arca; Dichio. Phillips. Manchester United ( 4-4-2): Van der Gouw; Clegg, Johnsen, O'Shea, P Neville; Chadwick (Healy, 96), Wallwark, Greening, Fortune; Solskjaer, Yorke. Referee: M Halsey.

      "body": "<b> Carlie Newman, director, Greater London Forum for the Elderly, writes:</b> Caroline Benn (Obituary, November 24) was a renowned expert on comprehensive schools, but also an excellent tutor of adults. In the days when there was still something called an adult education service, she taught young adults who had not passed examinations earlier and now wanted to progress academically. She was committed to helping them achieve their aims, and encouraged many to go on to more rewarding futures. <p>In 1986, she became involved with the home-tutor scheme for housebound elderly that I ran in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. When she heard of the pilot project, Caroline offered herself, and was a tutor in a variety of subjects, from literacy to comparative religion. She brought the same enthusi asm to her class of one person in their home as she did to the rest of her endeavours. </p> <p>Through Caroline, I was introduced to the Socialist Education Association, when she asked me to write about the scheme for an SEA publication. As president, she chaired and spoke at SEA conference meetings and at Labour party conferences. Small gathering or large, her husband, Tony, attended to support her. At his own meetings, he would often mention our very small scheme, and say that his wife worked for Carlie Newman! </p> <p>When Caroline attended an SEA meeting a few months ago - pushed in a wheelchair by Tony - she sat, taking notes in her usual fashion, and giving us her full attention, even though she knew she would not be with us for much longer. </p> <p>When I became a grandmother two years ago, she offered advice on how to achieve good relationships with the wider families of our children's partners. She was remarkable in keeping in touch with a wide range of existing relations, and new relations of her children. She was a great educationalist, a truly committed socialist and a generous friend. </p> <p> <b> Sheila Yeger writes: </b> In 1990, I was commissioned by the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, to write a play commemorating Keir Hardie's centenary. Caroline Benn's acclaimed biography was not yet published, but, with characteristic generosity, she invited me to read the manuscript. </p> <p>In Tony Benn's office, I trawled through her scholarly and profoundly human text, and discussed Hardie with them both, thus forming a picture of the first Labour MP, whose preoccupations, including internationalism, women's rights and vegetarianism, are still relevant today. </p> <p>At the first night of A Better Day, Caroline, resplendent in red silk, engaged in animated debate with a hostile theatre critic. She inscribed her biography to me: \"United by Keir Hardie and much more.\" It was a pleasure and a privilege to know her. </p> <p> <b> Sylvia Ayling writes:</b> In 1992, the year that her biography of Keir Hardie was published, the East London Historical Society invited Caroline Benn to unveil a memorial plaque to the founder of the Independent Labour party, one of a number which make up the Bow Heritage Trail. It marks the former site of the East London Federation of Suffragettes' women's hall, and honours Sylvia Pankhurst and Norah Smyth, both of whom were active in the area. </p> <p>As Caroline's researches had revealed, the ELFS was a breakaway group from Emmeline Pankhurst's increasingly autocratic WSPU, led by Sylvia, whose demand, as \"a citizen of the world who owed no barrier of race or nation\", was not merely for votes for women, but for an economic, as well as a political, democracy. </p> <p>Caroline duly appeared, outside the Lord Morpeth public house in the Old Ford Road, resplendent in red. Her riveting address was a wonderful summary of the campaigning life of Sylvia, whose family had enjoyed a close relationship with Hardie from their Manchester days. </p> <p>Afterwards in the pub, she revealed that she had only just come out of hsopital, having been badly injured in a car crash. Whatever the physical and psychological cost to her personally, it did not show. Pure joy was the order of the day. </p> <p>Later still, she spoke to members of the ELHS about her Hardie biography, bringing the past, and the characters she described, vividly to life, proving, as her husband has remarked, that if you will only blow on the embers of history, they will surely burst into flame.

      "bodyText": "Carlie Newman, director, Greater London Forum for the Elderly, writes: Caroline Benn (Obituary, November 24) was a renowned expert on comprehensive schools, but also an excellent tutor of adults. In the days when there was still something called an adult education service, she taught young adults who had not passed examinations earlier and now wanted to progress academically. She was committed to helping them achieve their aims, and encouraged many to go on to more rewarding futures. In 1986, she became involved with the home-tutor scheme for housebound elderly that I ran in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. When she heard of the pilot project, Caroline offered herself, and was a tutor in a variety of subjects, from literacy to comparative religion. She brought the same enthusi asm to her class of one person in their home as she did to the rest of her endeavours. Through Caroline, I was introduced to the Socialist Education Association, when she asked me to write about the scheme for an SEA publication. As president, she chaired and spoke at SEA conference meetings and at Labour party conferences. Small gathering or large, her husband, Tony, attended to support her. At his own meetings, he would often mention our very small scheme, and say that his wife worked for Carlie Newman! When Caroline attended an SEA meeting a few months ago - pushed in a wheelchair by Tony - she sat, taking notes in her usual fashion, and giving us her full attention, even though she knew she would not be with us for much longer. When I became a grandmother two years ago, she offered advice on how to achieve good relationships with the wider families of our children's partners. She was remarkable in keeping in touch with a wide range of existing relations, and new relations of her children. She was a great educationalist, a truly committed socialist and a generous friend. Sheila Yeger writes: In 1990, I was commissioned by the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, to write a play commemorating Keir Hardie's centenary. Caroline Benn's acclaimed biography was not yet published, but, with characteristic generosity, she invited me to read the manuscript. In Tony Benn's office, I trawled through her scholarly and profoundly human text, and discussed Hardie with them both, thus forming a picture of the first Labour MP, whose preoccupations, including internationalism, women's rights and vegetarianism, are still relevant today. At the first night of A Better Day, Caroline, resplendent in red silk, engaged in animated debate with a hostile theatre critic. She inscribed her biography to me: \"United by Keir Hardie and much more.\" It was a pleasure and a privilege to know her. Sylvia Ayling writes: In 1992, the year that her biography of Keir Hardie was published, the East London Historical Society invited Caroline Benn to unveil a memorial plaque to the founder of the Independent Labour party, one of a number which make up the Bow Heritage Trail. It marks the former site of the East London Federation of Suffragettes' women's hall, and honours Sylvia Pankhurst and Norah Smyth, both of whom were active in the area. As Caroline's researches had revealed, the ELFS was a breakaway group from Emmeline Pankhurst's increasingly autocratic WSPU, led by Sylvia, whose demand, as \"a citizen of the world who owed no barrier of race or nation\", was not merely for votes for women, but for an economic, as well as a political, democracy. Caroline duly appeared, outside the Lord Morpeth public house in the Old Ford Road, resplendent in red. Her riveting address was a wonderful summary of the campaigning life of Sylvia, whose family had enjoyed a close relationship with Hardie from their Manchester days. Afterwards in the pub, she revealed that she had only just come out of hsopital, having been badly injured in a car crash. Whatever the physical and psychological cost to her personally, it did not show. Pure joy was the order of the day. Later still, she spoke to members of the ELHS about her Hardie biography, bringing the past, and the characters she described, vividly to life, proving, as her husband has remarked, that if you will only blow on the embers of history, they will surely burst into flame. She was greatly admired, and her loss is deeply felt by those whose lives she touched. K Evans writes: The death of Caroline Benn reminds me of the occasion when she was a contributor to a residential course for teachers at the City of Worcester Training College in the early 1960s.

Once, during a friendly match in Holland, Shack dribbled through the whole of the opposing defence, finally rolling the ball back to Ford in the goalmouth with a cry of, \"Don't say I never give you a pass.\" Despite his talents, he was too idiosnycratic for a regular place in the England team, where it was always so important that the face should fit.</p> <p>It is told that once, when he was training with the England squad, Walter Winterbottom, the pedagogic England manager, said: \"I want all you five forwards to run down the field, interpassing the ball, until you come to the goal, where there'll be no goalkeeper.

Even prosecution lawyers agreed they could not directly prove that Fhimah was at the airport where the bomb was alleged to have been planted.</p> <p>Prosecution lawyers claim the bomb, which blew up Pan Am flight 103, was placed on a plane which left Malta's Luqa airport, and then transferred to the New York-bound jumbo at Frankfurt airport on December 21, 1988.</p> <p>But the advocate depute, Alastair Campbell, conceded yesterday there was no direct evidence to prove Fhimah was at Luqa airport on that date.

      "bodyText": "The case against one of the Libyans accused of the Lockerbie bombing teetered on a knife edge last night as judges retired to consider whether they would throw it out. Counsel for Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah told the Scottish court in the Netherlands there was \"not a jot of evidence\" against his client on some charges. Even prosecution lawyers agreed they could not directly prove that Fhimah was at the airport where the bomb was alleged to have been planted. Prosecution lawyers claim the bomb, which blew up Pan Am flight 103, was placed on a plane which left Malta's Luqa airport, and then transferred to the New York-bound jumbo at Frankfurt airport on December 21, 1988. But the advocate depute, Alastair Campbell, conceded yesterday there was no direct evidence to prove Fhimah was at Luqa airport on that date. He asked the judges to infer Fhimah's involvement in the bombing from circumstantial evidence - a request that was ridiculed by Richard Keen QC, counsel for Fhimah. \"Your lordships are being asked to infer that a man who wasn't there did, by a means we do not know, smuggle a bomb into Luqa airport,\" Mr Keen said. In the biggest mass murder trial in British history, Fhimah - along with his co-accused Abdelbaset Al Megrahi - faces charges of murder, conspiracy to murder and a breach of the Aviation Security Act. Before the defence had even begun its case, the trial judges were yesterday asked by Mr Keen to throw out the charges faced by Fhimah, on the basis of insufficient evidence to sustain any of them. Last night the judges retired to consider the application. It is likely they will return with their decision this morning. If they uphold the submission, Fhimah will be free to go home to Libya immediately - and one half of the \u00a32m-a-month trial will have collapsed. The judges' decision, however, will not affect Megrahi; his lawyers have indicated that their defence will blame Palestinian terrorist organisations for the atrocity. In the late 1980s, Fhimah worked as station manager for Libyan Arab Airlines at Luqa airport, though he had given up the position months before the Lockerbie bombing. The prosecution claimed he used the post as a front for his activities with the Libyan intelligence service, the JSO. But Mr Keen said yesterday there was no evidence to suggest Fhimah had been associated with JSO. Mr Keen told the court that the only evidence of Fhimah being involved with the JSO came from Abdul Majid Giaka, the Libyan \"supergrass\" who defected to the US; even he conceded that he had only assumed Fhimah was in the JSO. Mr Giaka had also told the court that Fhimah had shown him 10kg of TNT in his desk at Luqa airport. But Mr Keen said that was at least three months before the Lockerbie bombing, and Semtex, not TNT, was used in the attack. Mr Keen said that none of the evidence presented incriminated Fhimah in a conspiracy to destroy a civil aircraft with the consequent murder of its occupants. In response, Mr Campbell said Fhimah filled three key criteria needed to enable him to be a conspirator in the murder of the 270 who died in the Lockerbie bombing. He said Fhimah had access to luggage tags, he could get a suitcase holding a bomb through Luqa airport security, and he could get an unaccompanied bag on to an aircraft. Mr Campbell said Fhimah had carried out all three actions with full knowledge of their consequence.",

The number of smuggled cigarettes captured at ports has already soared above the 1.3bn uncovered in 1999, according to customs sources, with container fraud accounting for an estimated three-quarters of those detected. Seizures have risen from 32m barely five years ago to the current level and some se nior figures in customs suspect they are only stopping a tenth of the smuggled cigarettes flooding into Britain. Treasury ministers calculate they are losing \u00a32.5bn in taxes but claims by Imperial Tobacco that one in every three cigarettes smoked are smuggled or bought overseas suggests that the total could be much higher. As many as half the cigarettes seized by customs are believed to have been made by Bristol-based Imperial Tobacco which this week reported surging demand on the continent as sales continue to fall in the UK. A container labelled children's knitwear inspected in August at Avonmouth was found to contain nearly 5m cigarettes, half of them Imperial's Superking brand and half Gallaher's Sovereign make. A week later at Portbury docks, another container was found to carry 7m cigarettes, a third of them packs of Imperial's Regal and again the rest were Gallaher's Sovereign. An investigation into tobacco smuggling by the television company HTV screened last night in the west country named Imperial as one of the biggest exporters to Cyprus, which anti-smoking campaigners claim is at the hub of a smuggling ring. British companies, said HTV, have transported an estimated 12bn cigarettes to Cyprus - a country with a population of about 600,000 - over the past two years and many are believed to have illegally found their way back into Britain. Dawn Primarolo, the Treasury's paymaster-general responsible for customs and excise, told the programme: \"It does raise questions about whether all those cigarettes actually stay in Cyprus, whether they go somewhere else legitimately, moving on to another country or whether there is something else going on.\" Cyprus is an important staging post for legitimate exports to the Middle East and an Imperial spokeswoman yesterday said the company and its wholesalers, shippers and other contacts acted lawfully. \"Customs know exactly where we are exporting and the name of the customers,\" she said. \"We take great care in the agents and distributors we use and all our products are exported perfectly legally.\" Sales to Cyprus are thought to have grown dramatically after European customs effectively ended huge sales to Andorra where every man, woman and child would have had to smoke 140 a day if they had not been smuggled back to Britain and other countries.

Professor Ivo Pitanguy, who many consider to have started Brazil's craze for cosmetic surgery, is reluctant to say that the desire to alter one's body has gone too far. He says plastic surgery has an important role in society. \"It's is not about fashion, we are improving people's self esteem,\" he argues.",

      "bodyText": "An endangered American turtle with an oversized jaw and a taste for fishermen's fingers has been discovered living down a drain in Sydney. Six council workers needed a wheelbarrow to drag the 25kg (55lbs) alligator snapping turtle from a gutter in the suburb of Alexandria, where it was found at the weekend after recent heavy rain. Rescuers named the reptile Cowabunga, after the call-to-arms of the television cartoon characters, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, who emerged from the New York sewers in the early 1990s. The snapping turtle is the world's largest freshwater turtle. Native to the USA's south eastern states, it is on the WWF's (formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature) endangered list, and can grow up to a hefty 99.3kg (219lbs) during its 60-year life span. Unable to withdraw its head into its preternaturally spiny shell, the turtle uses its tough, beak-like jaw to defend itself and has been known to bite prying fishermen's hands. \"They're pretty dangerous,\" reptile expert Brad McDonald told Sydney's Daily Telegraph. The Australian Reptile Park in Sydney believes the turtle could be one of a batch of babies stolen from the park in 1979. Mr McDonald said Cowabunga could have survived in Sydney's waterways and drainage system for years, and predicted there might even be a whole family of snapping turtles living in the drains. Wild snapping turtles stalk fish, snakes, ducks and small mammals, but will also scavenge dead meat, rotting vegetation and snails. Sydney's snapping turtle could have feasted on rats and stray cats. Cowabunga is now resting in one of the Australian Reptile Park's pond. He will soon be paired up with a widowed female, dubbed the Terminator after she was found alive in the ashes of a fire which killed her mate several months ago. \"Hopefully, there'll be romance,\" said park spokesperson Mary Rayner.",

      "body": "<p>It was billed as \"the right idea at the right time\" - a merger of two of the top motor industry names - Daimler Benz of Germany and America's Chrysler. Together they would embody everything that was best about European and north American automotive making. </p> <p>Two years on, the wheels appear to be falling off. Daimler boss J\u00fcrgen Schrempp's American dream threatens to turn into a nightmare. Chrysler has been hit by a series of top executive departures. The business has fallen into the red, losing $512m (\u00a3361m) in the third quarter. The share price has plunged. At peak, just after the merger, the combined company had a market capitalisation of more than \u20ac90bn (\u00a354bn). Today it is barely half that figure. </p> <p>Finally, last week, Chrysler chairman Jim Holden joined the exodus. Stuttgart sent out two German executives to take over the driving seat at Chrysler HQ in Auburn Hills. There are now two Americans left on DaimlerChrysler's 12-strong management board. </p> <p>US shareholders are rebelling. Kirk Kerkorian, who has ruffled a few corporate feathers in his time, is suing for $8bn. Through his Tracinda Corporation, Mr Kerkorian owns some 4% of DaimlerChrysler, having been Chrysler's largest single shareholder before the tie-up. He claims shareholders were deceived because the deal was promoted as a merger of equals. Now, he argues, Chrysler looks less a partner, more a division. He wants Chrysler to be given back its independence. </p> <p>DaimlerChrysler dismissed Mr Kerkorian's claims as being without merit. It argues that the problems with the American half of the business have stemmed from what has been happening in the north American market. Demand is weakening and, with prices under pressure, Chrysler has been forced to offer heavy discounts in order to sell older models while the cost of bringing replacements to the market has been higher than expected. </p> <p>The light truck - vans to sports utilities - sector has been a particular area of concern. Chrysler was a front-runner in spotting the sector's potential but there are signs that the market may be maturing with too much capacity chasing slower sales growth. The unfolding saga is also coming to be seen as an illustration of what can go wrong with mega-mergers. </p> <p>Globalisation has spawned a string of mergers and acquisitions where the companies involved are not simply one large one swallowing a smaller one but more where the two are of the same or similar size. The two may get together because they believe they are a good fit, either in terms of products, geographic reach or both. </p> <p>But getting two strong, successful managements with different approaches to run in harness can be difficult. \"The trick is not to be a colonial power but to marry the two cultures. That is easier said than done,\" said one motor industry executive yesterday. DaimlerChrysler has not always helped its own case. Though the new set-up had two headquarters - Stuttgart and Auburn Hills - and two chairman, Mr Schrempp and Robert Eaton, it was incorporated in Germany. That meant it did not get into the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 in dex. As a result funds which tracked the index could not hold the stock - at least one reason why the proportion of DaimlerChrysler stock held in the US has fallen from 44% at the merger to only 20% now. US shareholders were also unhappy about the German company's decision to clamp down on US standards of disclosure. Soon after the merger, for example, the company stopped releasing details of individual executive pay packages. The crisis has put the spotlight on Mr Schrempp. Under his leadership Daimler has shifted from being a somewhat sprawling transport/technology conglomerate to a business with a much greater focus on the automotive sector. As well as the Chrysler deal Mr Schrempp has been shopping in Asia, buying stakes in Mitsubishi in Japan and Hyundai in South Korea. </p> <p>But while DaimlerChrysler can sport some impressive credentials to be a global automotive group it has to show that it is more than the sum of the parts. Though Mr Schrempp is now under fire from Mr Kerkorian it is the attitude of the group's biggest shareholder, Deutsche Bank, which is likely to prove crucial. Germany's biggest bank has almost 12% of the group. Earlier this month its chairman Rolf Breuer said the merger had been the right move. As long as Deutsche is supportive Mr Schrempp's vision is likely to carry the day. If Deutsche loses faith Chrysler could turn out to be Daimler's equivalent to BMW's Rover - though on a rather larger scale.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was billed as \"the right idea at the right time\" - a merger of two of the top motor industry names - Daimler Benz of Germany and America's Chrysler. Together they would embody everything that was best about European and north American automotive making. Two years on, the wheels appear to be falling off. Daimler boss J\u00fcrgen Schrempp's American dream threatens to turn into a nightmare. Chrysler has been hit by a series of top executive departures. The business has fallen into the red, losing $512m (\u00a3361m) in the third quarter. The share price has plunged. At peak, just after the merger, the combined company had a market capitalisation of more than \u20ac90bn (\u00a354bn). Today it is barely half that figure. Finally, last week, Chrysler chairman Jim Holden joined the exodus. Stuttgart sent out two German executives to take over the driving seat at Chrysler HQ in Auburn Hills. There are now two Americans left on DaimlerChrysler's 12-strong management board. US shareholders are rebelling. Kirk Kerkorian, who has ruffled a few corporate feathers in his time, is suing for $8bn. Through his Tracinda Corporation, Mr Kerkorian owns some 4% of DaimlerChrysler, having been Chrysler's largest single shareholder before the tie-up. He claims shareholders were deceived because the deal was promoted as a merger of equals. Now, he argues, Chrysler looks less a partner, more a division. He wants Chrysler to be given back its independence. DaimlerChrysler dismissed Mr Kerkorian's claims as being without merit. It argues that the problems with the American half of the business have stemmed from what has been happening in the north American market. Demand is weakening and, with prices under pressure, Chrysler has been forced to offer heavy discounts in order to sell older models while the cost of bringing replacements to the market has been higher than expected. The light truck - vans to sports utilities - sector has been a particular area of concern. Chrysler was a front-runner in spotting the sector's potential but there are signs that the market may be maturing with too much capacity chasing slower sales growth. The unfolding saga is also coming to be seen as an illustration of what can go wrong with mega-mergers. Globalisation has spawned a string of mergers and acquisitions where the companies involved are not simply one large one swallowing a smaller one but more where the two are of the same or similar size. The two may get together because they believe they are a good fit, either in terms of products, geographic reach or both. But getting two strong, successful managements with different approaches to run in harness can be difficult. \"The trick is not to be a colonial power but to marry the two cultures. That is easier said than done,\" said one motor industry executive yesterday. DaimlerChrysler has not always helped its own case. Though the new set-up had two headquarters - Stuttgart and Auburn Hills - and two chairman, Mr Schrempp and Robert Eaton, it was incorporated in Germany. That meant it did not get into the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 in dex. As a result funds which tracked the index could not hold the stock - at least one reason why the proportion of DaimlerChrysler stock held in the US has fallen from 44% at the merger to only 20% now. US shareholders were also unhappy about the German company's decision to clamp down on US standards of disclosure. Soon after the merger, for example, the company stopped releasing details of individual executive pay packages. The crisis has put the spotlight on Mr Schrempp. Under his leadership Daimler has shifted from being a somewhat sprawling transport/technology conglomerate to a business with a much greater focus on the automotive sector. As well as the Chrysler deal Mr Schrempp has been shopping in Asia, buying stakes in Mitsubishi in Japan and Hyundai in South Korea. But while DaimlerChrysler can sport some impressive credentials to be a global automotive group it has to show that it is more than the sum of the parts. Though Mr Schrempp is now under fire from Mr Kerkorian it is the attitude of the group's biggest shareholder, Deutsche Bank, which is likely to prove crucial. Germany's biggest bank has almost 12% of the group. Earlier this month its chairman Rolf Breuer said the merger had been the right move. As long as Deutsche is supportive Mr Schrempp's vision is likely to carry the day. If Deutsche loses faith Chrysler could turn out to be Daimler's equivalent to BMW's Rover - though on a rather larger scale.",

      "bodyText": "The head of Turkey's national intelligence agency, MIT, has said that his country should end a ban on Kurdish television broadcasts and not execute the jailed guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan. Senkal Atasagun's comments, published yesterday in local newspapers, mark a new phase in the debate about how Turkey should deal with the Kurdish issue which has blighted the country for so long. The prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, said Mr Atasagun's argument should be \"considered carefully\", but other members of the government and the military high command are known to oppose it. An end to the broadcasting ban and the abolition of the death penalty are among conditions set out by the EU for Turkish membership. Since Turkey became a formal candidate for membership a year ago arguments have been raging within the Turkish establishment about the speed of proposed reforms. Mr Atasagun, however, said that Turkey should simply act in its own interests. He pointed out that the official ban on broadcasting in Kurdish was leaving the field open to Medya TV, a satellite channel based in Europe which supports Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and is widely watched in Turkey's mainly Kurdish south-east. \"They are telling many lies, and everyone is watching these broadcasts by satellite,\" Mr Atasagun said. \"If we want to win the trust of our [Kurdish] citizens, we have to make them understand us.\" The spy chief was quoted as saying that the army agreed with him, but there has never been any public support from senior generals for meeting Kurdish cultural demands. The military has made it clear that it will oppose anything resembling a concession to the PKK. Since Ocalan was captured and put on trial last year, the number of violent incidents in south-eastern Turkey has fallen dramatically. By and large, the PKK has followed its jailed leader's orders and redirected its energies into a political struggle. It has been hard for Ankara to accept the political demands of even more moderate Turks, because of the sensitivity of dealing with the PKK. Even so, this month Mr Ecevit admitted that Turkey would \"sooner or later\" have to think about allowing Kurdish broadcasts. But the prime minister's deputy, Devlet Bahceli, who leads the rightwing Nationalist Action party, argued that such a move would \"fuel ethnic clashes and division\". Yesterday the defence minister, Sabahattin Cakmakog, chipped in. The personal opinions of the head of the MIT \"are not binding on the state\", he said.

Last week Mr Ecevit accused the EU of deceiving Turkey about the terms of its membership application, and he argued that plans for a new European defence force were \"trampling on Turkish rights\". Relations between Turkey and Europe will never be plain sailing, but a real debate is now under way about proposed reforms which were completely off limits until quite recently. In another sign that some things are changing for the better, 15 youths were found not guilty yesterday of membership of an illegal organistion, after a previous ruling that their confessions had been obtained by torture nearly five years ago. The trial of the \"Manisa children\" has been watched by human rights groups at home and abroad as a test of how serious Turkey is about cracking down on torture.

      "bodyText": "Lord Runcie, the former archbishop of Canterbury who died in July, has left a timebomb for his critic Lady Thatcher in the shape of a television interview criticising her policies, recorded a week before his death. The former archbishop was attacked by the government and tabloid press for his sermon praying for the dead of both sides after the Falklands war and for the Church of England's criticisms of policy in the inner cities. But he will have gentle posthumous revenge in a documentary made by his son James to be broadcast by Channel 4 on December 16. In it Lord Runcie, who was dying of cancer, confirmed he had directed the Falklands sermon, attacking the attitudes of \"those who stay at home, most violent in their attitudes and untouched in themselves\" at the government of the day. The sermon, at what the government had seen as a triumphal service at St Paul's Cathedral after the Falklands war in 1982, provoked attacks on the archbishop for a supposed lack of patriotism, all the more aggravating for ministers because, having won the Military Cross as a tank commander in the second world war, he could not be depicted as ignorant of warfare. During the interview at his home in St Albans, Lord Runcie admitted he had been surprised by the attacks and says the tone of the sermon was provoked by a newspaper article by the former Liberal leader Lord Grimond predicting his homily at the service would be full of trite establishment banalities. He felt \"you are not going to get that from me\" so he \"disobeyed my normal rule of saying that you should never think of a particular person to get at\". Lord Runcie, archbishop from 1980-91, said: \"In the 80s there were huge events with which one could not fail to be associated... \"For me there was a government that was successful in strengthening the economy and dealing with the unions and yet at the same time I could look out of the window at Lambeth Palace and see the fires of Brixton burning. \"There was a difficulty in recognising firm government but [also] recognising the damage done to the casualties of change and I had to speak up for them. \"I wasn't wholly convinced she [Lady Thatcher] was wrong but I was convinced something had to be done about the effects of her policies that turned me into a wet, someone who was wobbly.\" Lord Runcie also spoke of his wartime experience, including a visit to Belsen concentration camp just after its liberation, and of his role in royal events, including the ill-fated marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1981. \"With Princess Diana I think that archbishops of Canterbury were irrevocably linked up with school chaplains ... and often figures of fun ... it was very difficult for me to touch that other side of her which went to more curious avenues of help in times of real difficulty... astrology and so on.\" He said the attacks by the tabloid press were unfair, although James Runcie confirms there was some truth in the story that Lord Runcie and his wife, Lindy, came close to living apart because she disliked his public role. At the end of the interview, the former archbishop admitted: \"Somebody said 'The thing I like is that there is quite a lot of you that isn't a clergyman' _ I am not ashamed of that because our Lord wasn't particularly kind to clergymen. Well, they don't seem to have been his favourite characters in those days.\" My Father is scheduled to be shown on Channel 4 on December 16 at 8pm.",

Most water companies have seen a greater incidence of sewage flooding over the past five years.\" </p> <p>Ofwat, during its last price review, rejected Severn Trent's \u00a380m proposals for making better use of water resources and removed \u00a3400m from its capital investment plan for sewerage improvements and asset renewals. </p> <p>Mr Duckworth said the extra funding necessary to cope with the impact of climate change could be raised either through a small increase in charges to customers or through a reappraisal of environmental priorities. </p> <p>\"For example, should improving river quality have a higher priority than preventing sewage flooding?\" he said. </p> <p>Robert Walker, Severn Trent's new chief executive, said that the group had no plans to follow the example of other water companies, which are seeking to split the management and ownership of their regulated water assets. He believed the integrated businesses where the owners of the assets also ran the business were the best model. </p> <p>The group's first half pre-tax profits were \u00a356.3m lower than last year's at \u00a3112.8m - largely as a result of the 11.8% net reduction in water charges imposed by Ofwat and increased interest charges. The interim dividend has been maintained at 17p a share.</p>",

Its chairman, David Arculus, said the storms earlier this month had reinforced concerns about climate change. \"Our work with the Meteorological Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Change Forecasting demonstrates that wetter winters and drier summers will become characteristic weather patterns in the first half of the century,\" he said. \"Regulators and governments will need to address these impacts more pro-actively in the future than they have done to date.\" For prolonged periods earlier this month several of the group's water treatment plants and more than 50 sewage treatment works and sewerage pumping stations had been unable to operate. Mr Arculus criticised Sir Ian Byatt, the last Ofwat director-general, for not taking sufficient account of the group's spending plan for 2000-05. \"We were very disappointed by Ofwat's response to our resource plans for the period,\" he said. \"In a similar way, the lack of funding made available for upgrading the sewerage infrastructure was of concern.\" But Severn Trent, which provides water and sewerage services in the midlands and mid-Wales, said flooding had resulted in few disruptions to its services to customers. Brian Duckworth, managing director of the group's regulated water business, Severn Trent Water, said that much of the UK's sewerage network did not have the capacity to handle the very heavy downpours seen earlier this month. He said that 19th century sewers could not cope with 21st century storm conditions. \"Once-in-30-years storm events are now happening twice in a year,\" he said. \"It is not just these recent storms. Most water companies have seen a greater incidence of sewage flooding over the past five years.\" Ofwat, during its last price review, rejected Severn Trent's \u00a380m proposals for making better use of water resources and removed \u00a3400m from its capital investment plan for sewerage improvements and asset renewals. Mr Duckworth said the extra funding necessary to cope with the impact of climate change could be raised either through a small increase in charges to customers or through a reappraisal of environmental priorities. \"For example, should improving river quality have a higher priority than preventing sewage flooding?\" he said. Robert Walker, Severn Trent's new chief executive, said that the group had no plans to follow the example of other water companies, which are seeking to split the management and ownership of their regulated water assets. He believed the integrated businesses where the owners of the assets also ran the business were the best model. The group's first half pre-tax profits were \u00a356.3m lower than last year's at \u00a3112.8m - largely as a result of the 11.8% net reduction in water charges imposed by Ofwat and increased interest charges. The interim dividend has been maintained at 17p a share.",

The transport minister, Lord Macdonald, swiftly offered a concession which would see the transport bill - with its crucial plans to revive the railways and introduce congestion charging in cities - become law by the end of this week but the Nats sale delayed for three months. But last night the former transport minister, Gavin Strang, described the concession as \"not significant\".",

The other bullet marks had a clear downward projectory. \"They couldn't have been fired by a soldier on the ground,\" he said. \"I have never heard of anything that mentions this particular evidence.\" Edwin Glasgow QC for the soldiers said that there was no proof that a shot had been fired from the observation post. Recalling the gerrymandering on Derry council, which denied Catholics their natural majority, Mr Green said he joined the civil rights movement when it was formed in 1968. In answer to the question of whether the IRA ever tried to used the civil rights marches as a cover to attack the army, he said: \"Never. It would have destroyed the civil rights movement.\" Sinead McNicholl was secretary of the North Derry committee of the Northern Ireland civil rights association. She recalled the \"great brutality\" of the parachute regiment at a march at Magilligan the week before. People were beaten to the ground by soldiers and rubber bullets fired at close quarters. The inquiry watched a grainy film of the day with the young John Hume, later SDLP leader, remonstrating with a young British officer. On Bloody Sunday Ms McNicholl did not see the killing but she saw the terror of the demonstrators when the shots were fired and heard Bernadette Devlin, one of the firebrand speakers, telling everyone to duck. She ended her statement with these words: \"I believe that day I was still extremely naive and look back on it now as the last day of my innocence. I had always believed in justice. I didn't like the army being in Northern Ireland but thought that up until the day of Bloody Sunday there was a chance for civil rights to prevail. Bloody Sunday was the greatest step back in Northern Ireland history.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Clinton administration agreed to provide 15 national security briefings to both camps contending for the White House yesterday after George W Bush backed away from making a high profile effort to blast Al Gore out of his path. Mr Bush remained in Austin, Texas, yesterday, working on building an administration-in-waiting with the man he has named as his White House chief-of-staff, Andrew Card. The Bush team gave several indications that it has settled on a low key advance on Washington, at least until the US supreme court delivers its verdict on the voting in Florida next week. The political atmosphere in the US remained strikingly calm yesterday, the day after Mr Gore went on television to ask for patience as he pursues his court challenges to the declared result in Florida. But Republicans believe that public opinion is moving steadily in their direction and that Mr Bush only has to wait a few days for his victory to acquire an air of inevitability. The latest opinion polls seemed to support that claim, a Gallup poll yesterday showing that only 37% of Americans were willing to \"wait a little while longer\" for the result to be settled, compared with 62% who thought the contest had gone on too long. More than one in three Gore supporters said that he should concede the election, the poll found, and only 15% thought Mr Gore was \"the real winner\", compared with 51% for Mr Bush. Mr Bush's spokeswoman Karen Hughes told reporters that he wished to continue to be addressed as \"governor\" rather than \"president-elect\". More aggressive Republicans failed to take the hint. The party's whip in the House of Representatives, Tom DeLay, issued a statement praising \"President-elect Bush\". When he arrived at the Texas state capitol building yesterday Mr Bush confined his comments to the waiting media and the watching crowd to: \"Good to see you all, is what I say.\" He then entered the capital for three hours of meetings with Mr Card and Clay Johnson, whom he has appointed executive director of his transition team. As part of the measured approach, Mr Bush is believed to have delayed for a few days the announcement of any further major appointments to his putative administration. The appointments of the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Colin Powell, as secretary of state and Condoleeza Rice as national security adviser are thought to be likely next week, but Gen Powell was reported to have told Mr Bush that he did not want to be used as a pawn in the battle with Mr Gore. \"We can move fairly rapidly in a couple of areas, but he [Mr Bush] has to decide the timing,\" the vice-presidential candidate, Dick Cheney, who chairs the transition effort, said yesterday. He said there was a \"good possibility\" that a Bush cabinet would include Democrats. The main indication so far, however, is that it will contain many of the Republicans who worked in his father's cabinet in 1989-93. The White House agreed yesterday to set up daily national security briefings for both teams after Mr Gore had suggested the arrangement.",

Passage through it will be gained by visas, logged by computers and vetted by a data bank.</p> <p>This time it is nothing to do with the Russians, who are horrified to see their \"systema\", the Soviet barrier of double wire fences, pressed back into service. This is not an eastern empire keeping vassal states in, but a rich western market keeping the poorer states of eastern Europe out.</p> <p>It is called the Lace Curtain and, despite the deep misgivings it arouses in Poland, policing the EU's longest land border is the price Warsaw will have to pay when enlargement of the European Union - the core agenda item at next week's Nice summit - embraces Poland from 2005, or even sooner if Poland has its way.</p> <p>The thinking behind the demands for tighter border controls is simple, viewed from Berlin, Paris or London: Poland is welcome to join the European club but the invitation is not extended to millions of Russians, Belarussians, Lithuanians and Ukrainians across Poland's all too leaky border. Yet viewed from Warsaw, membership of the EU was not supposed to be like this. It was hailed as the end of history, finally awarding Poland the cast iron guarantee of statehood - which its flickering presence on the 20th century map of Europe had so lacked - as a reward for bringing down communism and joining Nato.</p> <p>A six-hour train ride away from Warsaw, in the thickly forested valleys of the Bieszczady mountains at Ustrzyki Gorne, the latest watchtower was being blessed this month. Everyone was crammed into the village church, including Poland's interior minister, its chief of police, the head of the fire service and the border guards, plus a bevy of bishops. An honour guard filled the aisle; a regimental band was in the gallery.</p> <p>Poland's border with Ukraine is only just beginning to open again after the collapse of the rouble stopped millions of shuttle traders from the east. The border has been fought over and ethnically cleansed several times in the last century, the last being in 1948 when more than 650,000 Ukrainians were deported from the foothills after a bitter partisan war fought by a Ukrainian nationalist army, the UPA.</p> <p><b> Bitter memories</b><br></p> <p>The scars of the conflict are still raw.

      "bodyText": "A new line of division is being carved through the heart of Europe. It will consist of wire fences, a force of border guards thousands strong and a network of watchtowers stretching 745 miles from the Carpathian mountains in the south of Poland to the Baltic in the north. Passage through it will be gained by visas, logged by computers and vetted by a data bank. This time it is nothing to do with the Russians, who are horrified to see their \"systema\", the Soviet barrier of double wire fences, pressed back into service. This is not an eastern empire keeping vassal states in, but a rich western market keeping the poorer states of eastern Europe out. It is called the Lace Curtain and, despite the deep misgivings it arouses in Poland, policing the EU's longest land border is the price Warsaw will have to pay when enlargement of the European Union - the core agenda item at next week's Nice summit - embraces Poland from 2005, or even sooner if Poland has its way. The thinking behind the demands for tighter border controls is simple, viewed from Berlin, Paris or London: Poland is welcome to join the European club but the invitation is not extended to millions of Russians, Belarussians, Lithuanians and Ukrainians across Poland's all too leaky border. Yet viewed from Warsaw, membership of the EU was not supposed to be like this. It was hailed as the end of history, finally awarding Poland the cast iron guarantee of statehood - which its flickering presence on the 20th century map of Europe had so lacked - as a reward for bringing down communism and joining Nato. A six-hour train ride away from Warsaw, in the thickly forested valleys of the Bieszczady mountains at Ustrzyki Gorne, the latest watchtower was being blessed this month. Everyone was crammed into the village church, including Poland's interior minister, its chief of police, the head of the fire service and the border guards, plus a bevy of bishops. An honour guard filled the aisle; a regimental band was in the gallery. Poland's border with Ukraine is only just beginning to open again after the collapse of the rouble stopped millions of shuttle traders from the east. The border has been fought over and ethnically cleansed several times in the last century, the last being in 1948 when more than 650,000 Ukrainians were deported from the foothills after a bitter partisan war fought by a Ukrainian nationalist army, the UPA. Bitter memories The scars of the conflict are still raw. In the villages outside the regional capital, Przemysl, monuments are clandestinely raised to the UPA, which the Poles vow to tear down. In the Carmelite garrison church of Przemysl, the monument to the war dead still causes indignation. A double-headed eagle with a Nazi swastika under one wing, it has the following text under the other: \"To commemorate innocent Polish people bestially murdered by UPA bands in the south-eastern borders of Poland in 1942-8.\" A Ukrainian newspaper, the High Castle, meanwhile refers to this area as \"Polish-occupied Ukraine\".

The new system, designed to balance demand and supply more promptly, should save 29m electricity customers be tween 10% and 20% on their bills - according to ministers, who wanted it in place long before the general election. Lisa Waters, a regulatory analyst at Dynegy, a US energy trading company, said the six-month delay would cost customers \u00a31.5bn, or \u00a357 each - a figure that Mr McCarthy did not challenge. \"The government must be worried that bills won't come down soon enough, particularly for domestic consumers, and that gas bills are set to rise too,\" she said. Mr McCarthy said he deeply regretted the delays but added he could not guarantee the March 27 date for \"going live\", even though it was \"entirely realistic\". Neta will have more than 100 participants compared with the handful in the pool, and has cost Ofgem \u00a3100m to set up. It estimates Neta's cost per customer at 50p a year and the cost of delay at 7p a year over five years, compared with big savings under the new system. But Mr O'Neill said: \"The generators will not suffer because of delays, but customers will.\"",

Robert Gariano, a former GE employee who is now an executive recruiter for Russell Reynolds Associates, said: \"He grew up with a laptop on his desk. Jack [Welch] and I grew up with slide rules.\" </p> <p>However, Mr Welch was one of the earliest and most passionate apostles of the internet among US businessmen. When asked what his most effective attributes were, analysts cited Mr Immelt's managerial and people skills. He is liked by colleagues, who admire his dedication and sense of humour. </p> <p>Although Mr Immelt was saying little about his plans, he is expected to increase diversity at GE, where few women or people from ethnic minority backgrounds hold senior positions. Dennis Dammerman, a senior board member, described the division meetings headed by Mr Immelt as \"like a meeting of the United Nations\". </p> <p>\"I don't think about following Jack,\" Mr Immelt said. \"I assume there's going to be no honeymoon and people are going to look for us to meet our commitments.

Mr Immelt also realises the importance of the internet to GE's business. Robert Gariano, a former GE employee who is now an executive recruiter for Russell Reynolds Associates, said: \"He grew up with a laptop on his desk. Jack [Welch] and I grew up with slide rules.\" However, Mr Welch was one of the earliest and most passionate apostles of the internet among US businessmen. When asked what his most effective attributes were, analysts cited Mr Immelt's managerial and people skills. He is liked by colleagues, who admire his dedication and sense of humour. Although Mr Immelt was saying little about his plans, he is expected to increase diversity at GE, where few women or people from ethnic minority backgrounds hold senior positions. Dennis Dammerman, a senior board member, described the division meetings headed by Mr Immelt as \"like a meeting of the United Nations\". \"I don't think about following Jack,\" Mr Immelt said. \"I assume there's going to be no honeymoon and people are going to look for us to meet our commitments. The company is in an excellent position to do that.\"",

      "bodyText": "The European Union's in-house bank has agreed to bail out John Prescott's faltering effort to part-privatise the London Underground. It is to lend nearly \u00a31bn to the companies bidding to take over half the tube's business. A letter from the European Investment Bank to the London Transport chairman, Sir Malcolm Bates, passed to the Guardian, confirms that that the EIB board has approved loans of \u00a3300m each to whichever three consortiums win the 30-year contracts to run the tube's track and signalling. The disclosure of the loans, which amount to more than a third of the \u00a32.5bn the bidders are meant to raise for investment in the cash-starved underground, follows persistent rumours that the bidders were struggling to attract the finance in the private sector. The leaked letter, signed by the EIB director Thomas Barrett and dated Monday of this week, said the board of the Luxembourg-based bank had \"agreed to support this public-private partnership project in view of its strategic importance to the improvement of public transport services in London\". The government's plans for the tube, already more than a year behind schedule, have attracted strong opposition from the London Labour party, trade unions and the London mayor Ken Livingstone, who is due to take over responsibility for the scheme after the private handover has taken place next year. Last night Mr Livingstone said he was stunned by the loan commitment, which is backed by the EU member governments. \"I thought the whole point of the partial privatisation was that the PPP companies would finance investment in the tube, but this shows that the private bids are based on state-backed loans from the EU.\" \"This is the first I've heard about it,\" he said, adding that it underlined the need for his new transport commissioner for London, former New York subway boss Robert Kiley, to be given all documents and information on the plans. An EIB spokesman said he could not comment, but at Mr Prescott's environment and transport department a spokesman said the EIB's interest \"shows the strength of our proposals\". Following the government's second defeat in the Lords this week over his plans to sell off half the national air traffic control service, Mr Prescott was yesterday forced to defend his part-privatisation scheme for the tube from both sides in the Commons. Goaded by the Conservatives' environment spokesman, Archie Norman - who said progress on the London Underground scheme was now \"slower than a Doncaster to London express train\" - the deputy prime minister insisted that the timetable given to MPs still held. Although the potential political costs of pressing ahead have risen and public opinion in London hardened against the scheme since the Hatfield rail disaster last month, Mr Prescott shows no signs of backing off. Last week, the four private consortiums bidding for the first two sections of the tube network to be contracted out submitted their \"best and final offers\". The leaked letter from the EIB stated that the EU bank supported three out of the four submissions, while making clear that the basic terms of the loans would be available to whichever consortiums were successful. The letter was copied to Mike Fuhr - the senior civil servant at the transport department most closely involved with the project - and Sir Steve Robson, second permanent secretary at the Treasury, who played a key role in privatisation programmes by previous Conservative governments and has since worked closely with the former treasury minister, Geoffrey Robinson, to develop this government's private finance schemes.",

The Northern Ireland secretary will rule on the badge if the police board cannot reach agreement.</p> <p>In his article in last night's Belfast Telegraph, Mr Patten endorsed Mr Mandelson's stance on the badge and swept aside nationalist objections to the act.</p> <p>\"Political parties and other community leaders should now ... start to encourage youth from all parts of Northern Ireland to apply to join the police,\" he wrote. \"The combination of [the ombudsman's office] and the policing board means that Northern Ireland will have, to the best of my knowledge, the most rigorous system of civilian oversight in the world.\"</p> <p>Mr Patten hinted that he was not happy with every element of the act, but he reserved his strongest criticism for Sinn Fein. Republicans insist that they cannot accept changes to Mr Patten's recommendations because, they say, the report is a compromise which stretches them as far as they can go.</p> <p>The European commissioner, who was careful not to name Sinn Fein, said that his report was not a political compromise: \"We tested our proposals entirely against policing benchmarks, not political ones.</p> <p>Mitchel McLaughlin, the Sinn Fein chairman, said: \"He certainly is silent on the fact that the report has, in fact, been gutted by the British government.\"</p> <p>Mr Mandelson welcomed the article and appealed to nationalists not to boycott the board. \"The politics of boycott did not bring us the Good Friday agreement and it won't bring us the new police service that we want.\"</p>",

Sinn Fein and the SDLP believe that the police act, which was passed last week, severely weakens the powers of the new police board and the new police ombudsman. Nationalists also believe that Mr Mandelson has failed to live up to Mr Patten's recommendation for a new badge which is \"free from association\" with Britain or Ireland. The Northern Ireland secretary will rule on the badge if the police board cannot reach agreement. In his article in last night's Belfast Telegraph, Mr Patten endorsed Mr Mandelson's stance on the badge and swept aside nationalist objections to the act. \"Political parties and other community leaders should now ... start to encourage youth from all parts of Northern Ireland to apply to join the police,\" he wrote. \"The combination of [the ombudsman's office] and the policing board means that Northern Ireland will have, to the best of my knowledge, the most rigorous system of civilian oversight in the world.\" Mr Patten hinted that he was not happy with every element of the act, but he reserved his strongest criticism for Sinn Fein. Republicans insist that they cannot accept changes to Mr Patten's recommendations because, they say, the report is a compromise which stretches them as far as they can go. The European commissioner, who was careful not to name Sinn Fein, said that his report was not a political compromise: \"We tested our proposals entirely against policing benchmarks, not political ones. Mitchel McLaughlin, the Sinn Fein chairman, said: \"He certainly is silent on the fact that the report has, in fact, been gutted by the British government.\" Mr Mandelson welcomed the article and appealed to nationalists not to boycott the board. \"The politics of boycott did not bring us the Good Friday agreement and it won't bring us the new police service that we want.\"",

God bless him!\" Jonathan Sayeed, a Bristol Tory, said grumpily that he was grateful to the minister \"for repeating one of his Labour stooge's press releases.\" \"But he's a Tory, a Tory!\" yelled the Labour benches. \"He may call himself a Tory,\" said Mr Sayeed, darkly, meaning we know not what. But it was too late. Mr Hill's teeth flashed their message of triumph all around the chamber.",

Mr Blair would love to have hosted an early Downing Street summit with President-elect Gore, where the two might have toasted yet another victory for the centre-left. Mr Hague would happily have trotted over to Austin to join the queue of foreign dignitaries introducing themselves to President-elect Bush - gently pointing Britain out on the map, just to prevent any confusion. Both would have hailed an American triumph as a good-luck charm for their own electoral contest next spring.</p> <p>But they, along with the rest of the world, have been denied so clear a sign. They have not been able to draw the instant lessons from America, or to open up the transatlantic trade in ideas, that usually follows a US election. Instead Britain's politicians have, like the American electorate, been in a state of suspended animation for three weeks - all analysis on hold.</p> <p>Yet there is much to look at and much to learn. For this 22-day post-election battle in America has been at least as revealing as the 18-month election contest which preceded it. The paralysis has laid bare an ugly fact about the American right - one eerily echoed by conservatism's lead forces here in Britain. It is a feature that the left, both here and in America, ignores at its peril.</p> <p>Throughout, the Republicans have behaved not as if they and the Democrats were locked in a uniquely close race - but as if their opponents were bafflingly and selfishly refusing to recognise a clear defeat. The constant calls on Gore to concede, to bow out gracefully, would make sense if the Democrat had transparently won fewer votes than Bush. But he didn't: he won 323,000 more votes nationally and may well have won more in Florida, the kingmaker state under America's electoral college system.</p> <p>Yet since the morning after the election night before, Bush and his surrogates - most notably the silkily scary former secretary of state, James Baker - have acted as if Gore was a sore loser and a constitutional wrecker, refusing to bow to the democratic will. As if that will has ever been clear.</p> <p>So Republicans repeat that there has been a count, a recount and a re-recount - and that Bush has been the winner each time. They choose not to mention that even on the votes that have been counted (and that's not all of them) Bush's margin has been wildly different - and smaller - with each total, proving that the picture is not at all clear and needs sorting out.</p> <p>There is an explanation for this tone, and for the constant claims that Gore is trying to \"steal\" the election, when all he asks for is a full and accurate count which he may well lose. It is that, fundamentally, Republicans don't believe that a Democrat like Gore belongs in power - no matter how many votes he gets.</p> <p>That should be a shocking statement to make about a democracy, yet it is an accurate description of a wide vein in Republican thinking. The assumption, all too visible on the faces of Baker, Bush and would-be vice president and \"transition\" boss, Dick Cheney, is that they are Republicans and should therefore run the country - and who the hell is this man Gore to hold them up?</p> <p>That is why the American right has resorted to the tactics of a virtual coup d'etat to install its candidate - and restore what it regards as the rightful order of things. It sent in a baying mob to surround the vote-counting room in Miami-Dade county last week - shouting and pounding away until the local officials were so intimidated they abandoned their recount only a fifth of the way through. It has welcomed an incomplete vote certified by a Florida official who just happens to be the co-chair of the Bush campaign in the state - the Cruella de Ville of Republican politics, Katherine Harris - and who deliberately excluded updated figures which boosted Gore. Nor does it mention that the result was formally sealed by Florida's governor, Bush's brother Jeb. If this was how Democrats won an election, Republicans would denounce it as a travesty - but because it restores the natural order of politics, by putting them back in the White House, they can't imagine how anyone could question it.</p> <p>Those who dare are instantly condemned as illegitimate. When a Florida court found in Bush's favour, it was a triumph for the rule of law. But when the supreme court overturned that decision and ruled against Bush, the justices were trashed as a bunch of Democrat appointees who could not be trusted.</p> <p>Here is the alarming echo for Britain. Last week saw a vicious attack on Britain's top soldier, Charles Guthrie, the chief of the defence staff, in the Daily Mail. The paper condemned him for failing to block Tony Blair's plan to commit 12,500 British troops to a future European rapid reaction force, using the most lurid language of partisan hostility - even accusing the general of harbouring a schoolboy's homoerotic crush on the PM.</p> <p>For the Mail and its backers on the Tory right, Guthrie had become a legitimate political target because he serves under and had failed to thwart a Labour government. Blair rightly seized on the assault, making it the theme of last week's Cabinet meeting, because it revealed more than an objection to Labour's defence policy. It was proof, said the PM, that the rightwing simply do not accept the legitimacy of his administration or of anyone who serves it. \"For them it is an affront and an outrage that there is a Labour government at all,\" says one Downing Street aide.</p> <p>Accordingly, the right will not only condemn those, like Guthrie, who work for a Labour administration, but support any attempt to unseat it: hence Mr Hague's praise for September's fuel protesters as \"fine, upstanding citizens\". In this, Britain's Conservatives are entirely in step with their American cousins.</p> <p>For the presumption on both the British and US right is that they represent not just the natural party but the natural order of government - and that any challenge to that dominance, no matter how democratic, is fundamen tally illegitimate. The occasional exception can be made, when the right screws up or disgraces itself: Watergate in America, sleaze here. An occasional charismatic figure of the left might slip through the net - a Kennedy or a Clinton, once a generation - but before too long the right chaps will be back in.</p> <p>Bill Clinton suffered from this for eight years, besieged by a Republican right that flatly refused to accept him as president: a refusal which culminated in the impeachment effort of 1998-9. Gore is grappling with that same arrogance of presumed power right now - and so, in a quieter, less obvious way, is Mr Blair. The left needs to know this about its adversaries, on both sides of the Atlantic. But so does everyone else.

      "body": "<p>Somebody needed to say it. A distinguished group of medics on the Lords select committee on science and technology obliged yesterday. A one-year study of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has produced a blunt conclusion. Most CAM training courses involve unacceptable variations in content, depth and duration; the regulation of the multiplying number of different specialties is fragmented and inadequate; and research on their effectiveness is virtually non-existent. But before sceptics respond with the Mandy Rice Davies reply (\"they would, wouldn't they\"), yesterday's report is not a self-serving, protectionist defence of modern medicine. Far from wanting to suppress complementary and alternative therapies, the medics want to bring them under the National Health Service umbrella, but only where they can demonstrate their effectiveness.

      "bodyText": "Somebody needed to say it. A distinguished group of medics on the Lords select committee on science and technology obliged yesterday. A one-year study of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has produced a blunt conclusion. Most CAM training courses involve unacceptable variations in content, depth and duration; the regulation of the multiplying number of different specialties is fragmented and inadequate; and research on their effectiveness is virtually non-existent. But before sceptics respond with the Mandy Rice Davies reply (\"they would, wouldn't they\"), yesterday's report is not a self-serving, protectionist defence of modern medicine. Far from wanting to suppress complementary and alternative therapies, the medics want to bring them under the National Health Service umbrella, but only where they can demonstrate their effectiveness. The committee rightly concludes that the public needs much better independent guidance on CAM thera pies, and recommends the NHS should be given this responsibility. It calls for more government funding for CAM research, noting the success of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the US. CAM therapists - now, at 50,000, outnumbering GPs by 10,000 - will rightly note that only 20% of modern medicine is evidence-based. But this proportion is growing exponentially.

If they had been charged with possession of cannabis, or even if they had killed a Celtic supporter outside a pub while on leave, they would in all likelihood have been kicked out of the army, but a uniform confers diplomatic immunity. After all, the atrocities committed against Irish people these past 30-odd years have been carried out in the name of peacekeeping - the very same role envisaged for the devolved European regiment.</p> <p>But one should not imagine that the only uniformed keepers of the peace involved in controversy are the ones who kill the Irish.

Another such man, Christopher Alder, was finally laid to rest on Saturday. The officers who stood around him as he lay dying are charged with \"wilful misconduct in public office\", which is one way of putting it. Christopher had been a paratrooper at one time, but never killed any civilians. Perhaps if he had the state might have taken more care of him .</p>",

If they had been charged with possession of cannabis, or even if they had killed a Celtic supporter outside a pub while on leave, they would in all likelihood have been kicked out of the army, but a uniform confers diplomatic immunity. After all, the atrocities committed against Irish people these past 30-odd years have been carried out in the name of peacekeeping - the very same role envisaged for the devolved European regiment. But one should not imagine that the only uniformed keepers of the peace involved in controversy are the ones who kill the Irish. Last week, we also heard that no police officers would be prosecuted for their involvement in the \"restraint\" of Roger Sylvester, because prosecutors found insufficient evidence. \"Restraining\" appears to be the way in which black people meet their deaths in police custody. Another such man, Christopher Alder, was finally laid to rest on Saturday. The officers who stood around him as he lay dying are charged with \"wilful misconduct in public office\", which is one way of putting it. Christopher had been a paratrooper at one time, but never killed any civilians. Perhaps if he had the state might have taken more care of him .",

      "body": "<p>Legend has it that the blues guitarist Robert Johnson couldn't play a lick until he met the devil at a crossroads one night and sold him his soul. It was not a good bargain. Johnson was dead at 37, poisoned in 1938 by the jealous husband of one of his lovers. But his reputation lives on - he is still regarded as one of the world's greatest ever blues musicians. </p> <p>The story of Johnson is the basis of Stephen Jeffreys's latest play, I Just Stopped By To See the Man, which previews at the Royal Court, London, this week in a production by Richard Wilson. At 64, Wilson is very far from the grave, and consolidating his reputation as a major director of new plays. </p> <p>In Jeffreys's play, set in a shotgun house (so called because you could shoot from the porch right through to the yard door in a straight line) in the Mississippi Delta in 1975, Johnson is transformed into the character of Jesse Davidson, and history, into fiction. </p> <p>Jesse is a blues player who has gained mythical status after his disappearance some years previously.

      "bodyText": "Legend has it that the blues guitarist Robert Johnson couldn't play a lick until he met the devil at a crossroads one night and sold him his soul. It was not a good bargain. Johnson was dead at 37, poisoned in 1938 by the jealous husband of one of his lovers. But his reputation lives on - he is still regarded as one of the world's greatest ever blues musicians. The story of Johnson is the basis of Stephen Jeffreys's latest play, I Just Stopped By To See the Man, which previews at the Royal Court, London, this week in a production by Richard Wilson. At 64, Wilson is very far from the grave, and consolidating his reputation as a major director of new plays. In Jeffreys's play, set in a shotgun house (so called because you could shoot from the porch right through to the yard door in a straight line) in the Mississippi Delta in 1975, Johnson is transformed into the character of Jesse Davidson, and history, into fiction. Jesse is a blues player who has gained mythical status after his disappearance some years previously. In fact he is alive and living with his daughter, a college-educated black activist who has her own reasons for being holed up in a dirt-poor shack. Tensions are already running high, but the the arrival of Carl, a white English rock star who has long been on Jesse's trail, leads to an explosive situation. The amiable Jeffreys, 50, who with his shaggy halo of hair looks as if he has just stepped out of the 1970s himself, has long been intrigued by the blues.

      "body": "<p>Sauntering into a newsagent's recently, I glimpsed a row of about a dozen magazines with covers graced by scantily clad women in provocative positions that signify pornography. I took a few steps back and looked up at the store's sign to check I hadn't wandered into a dirty bookstore by mistake. But no, this was a regular retail outlet selling mainstream publications. When exactly, I wondered, did the world become so smutty? I felt my cheeks flush. Could I, Bruce La Bruce, pornographer, be blushing? </p> <p>I am, however, according to the title of my memoirs, \"The Reluctant Pornographer\", which may explain my ambivalence toward the notion of pornography taking over the free world. I don't watch porn. I don't collect it, I don't keep tabs on the latest porn stars and their exploits, I don't even incorporate it into my sex life. One reason for this may be that, like many gay men, I tend to live my life as if I were a porn star anyway, so I have no need to watch it. </p> <p>Another reason may be that I encounter enough \"found pornography\" in ordinary, everyday images, which can be utilised as jack-off material: young black men, their clothes scissored off, being operated on in the emergency room in an episode of American documentary Trauma: Life in the ER; or, at a pinch, good, old-fashioned men's gymnastics. I find these images, along with the amateur porn self-portraits that members of the public send me over the internet, much more stimulating than the average entertainment adult video. </p> <p>As someone who has made a number of sexually explicit avant-garde films in which he has performed oral sex and sodomy, I've been stuck with the epithets \"porn star\" and \"pornographer\". So shouldn't I be immune to the moral issues that are raised by such porn staples as bestiality, rape fantasies and snuff? </p> <p>I'm not supposed to blush or become embarrassed or, presumably, feel any normal human emotion, especially with regard to sex, since I entered that netherworld inhabited by those who have dared to commit their sexual practices to celluloid or videotape for public consumption. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Although I consider myself an artist who works in pornography, I've discovered it's not a world in which you can survive for long without a normal set of human responses, and yes, a strong moral compass. </p> <p>With so much emphasis lately on the \"mainstreaming\" of pornography and on the blurring of the line between art and porn, little attention is being paid, particularly by those who are indulging in it, to the depth and darkness of the sexual imagination and the implications of toying with this dark side. The multi-billion-dollar porn industry, which nonetheless still operates as a kind of dirty little secret, is nothing less than an adjunct of the collective unconscious, and to bring it to the surface, to \"mainstream\" it, may be to unleash things we're not prepared to handle. </p> <p>Gender studies and postmodern courses on desire introduced academics to sex-trade workers and pornographers in the 1980s and 90s. Some academics I knew even segued into various sex trades as part of their research, often with disastrous results. One learns quickly that there is nothing noble or glamorous about getting fucked for money, either through pornography or prostitution. As I stood on the set of my first \"legitimate\" porn movie and found myself obliged to walk over and wipe the ass of one of the performers who was experiencing a little anal leakage, I didn't feel particularly glamorous. </p> <p> Once a participant in the sex trade, you must also be prepared for the wall of moral disapprobation that you will run up against - which may come from the most surprisingly liberal sources. Factor in the other occupational hazards (STDs, emotional instability, drug abuse) and you may find yourself longing for a life a little more humdrum. </p> <p>Today we're supposed to be beyond all these mundane, practical considerations. The debate raging now is about aesthetics - about how pornographic images are mediated in the mainstream, and about the lexicon that has developed to accommodate this imagery. I'm quite willing to consider the aesthetic dimension of pornography because I think that's what ultimately civilises porn and makes sense of it. The fact that 95% of the pornography that is produced today is unwatchable pap can be directly attributed to the advent of video and the concomitant decline of aesthetics. </p> <p>When pornography was being produced exclusively on film in the 60s and 70s, the emphasis on camera style and narrative and the formal mediation of content - the artistic considerations - were as important as capturing the sexual moment, which today has become the singular, all-consuming focus. </p> <p>The digital revolution has ushered in an era of literalism, an unimaginative unity of style and substance that reduces meaning to a set of stylistic imperatives devoid of any complex interplay. The notion that formal aspects may engage content in such a way as to produce contradiction or paradox or synthesis has been subsumed by the slavish capitulation of meaning to technology and production - to pure form. </p> <p>This is probably one of the reasons that the signifiers of the mainstream entertainment industry and of the adult film industry have started to become indistinguishable. Their fixation on the means of production, instead of on the production of meaning, has resulted in a dumbed-down, sexually extreme aesthetic that has been proven to be the most commercially viable. Mainstream stars and porn stars alike are forced to conform to the same hypersexualised image, regardless of the nature of the product they're promoting. It is a bland standardisation of sexuality that has little or nothing to do with liberal or progressive attitudes towards sex. </p> <p>My initial motivations for getting into pornographic representation, back when I was a punk in the 80s making underground fanzines and experimental Super 8 movies, were not only aesthetic but also political and, yes, revolutionary. I was a sexual idealist. </p> <p>My work since has been as much about the intersection of race and class with homosexual representation as about filming and photographing hot, sexy boys; as much about examining sexual stereotypes and iconography as about getting off. I can't deny that there was pleasure in the text, but the text itself was always as important. Audiences today are so inured to the blandification of extreme sexual imagery that it no longer has that same kind of subversive impact.

You keep thinking, \"Hang on, who's that one?\" So I hope you agree with my conclusion that The Sopranos is fantastic television and the biggest load of garbage you have ever seen.",

      "body": "<p>Conrad Voss Bark, who has died at the age of 87, was a household name throughout the 1950s and 1960s - not just because of his memorable surname, but because he was a daily presence on Radio Newsreel, news bulletins and, later, television news, reporting parliament as the BBC's gallery correspondent. He joined the corporation from the Times in 1951, and was one of a team of only three men; initially, there was no lobby correspondent. </p> <p>Voss Bark was born near Hull, and educated at Hymer's College, Hull, and Bristol grammar school. He was a Quaker and, during the blitz, was injured while serving in a mobile ambulance unit. </p> <p>He was a sub-editor by training, and, having worked on the Hampstead News and the Western Daily Press in the era of newsprint rationing, had learned how to make words count. This gift for concision, for taking complex political issues and turning them into a terse and simple narrative, served him well. He often had to broadcast live, without a teleprompter, and at short notice, from his shorthand notes. </p> <p>Once, while reporting a speech by the Labour leader, Hugh Gaitskell, after leaving the Commons chamber at the last moment, Voss Bark said on air: \"I'm sorry, I can't read my shorthand . . .\" He recovered, and made the rest up, but thought that he would get the sack - only to discover that millions of listeners had enjoyed the human drama. The phone lines to Broadcasting House were jammed with messages of sympathy and congratulations, largely from shorthand typists. </p> <p>Voss Bark had a famous ability to edit his notes as he went along, only taking down essentials; he once won fame with his colleagues by taking down the whole of a Budget speech on one side of a sheet of foolscap. His secret was knowing which bits would not interest the listener. </p> <p>He covered stirring times - the end of the Churchill government, the Suez crisis, the arrival of women life peers in 1958, the era of Harold Wilson's premiership and the Commons debate on the American bombing of Hanoi. </p> <p>Voss Bark always gave an impression of tightlipped unflapability, reliable and authoritative. But he could get excited, and convey that excitement - as when he came out of the gallery, after hearing Bernadette Devlin's maiden speech, to proclaim that she was \"just like Joan of Arc\". </p> <p>He was never told by editors what to say, but often came under political pressure, particularly during the Suez crisis, when rightwing Conservatives objected to the BBC reporting the deep divisions in parliamentary and public opinion. An internal BBC inquiry cleared him of bias. </p> <p>He did once fall foul of his editors. He had listened to the Conservative home secretary, RA Butler, giving an involved and equivocating set of answers about a possible inquiry into the case of a man hanged for murder. Conrad summed up his report by saying that Butler had given a \"non-committal reply\" - and got a rocket from his editor. Irritated by the response, he showed his script to Butler, who agreed it was fair comment because he had intended to be non-committal. </p> <p>Voss Bark would enjoy telling colleagues about the hair-raising early days of BBC televison news at Alexandra Palace, to which he was sent as a sub-editor from Egton House. Early broadcasts, dubbed \"the magic lantern show\" by the press, consisted of stills with an off-screen voice. Conrad would be given three hours' notice that he was to read the news that night. There was no training, little rehearsal and no teleprompt. He was told not to say good evening, or smile. He was not allowed to change the script. After a few months, he escaped to the Commons press gallery. </p> <p>His private passion was fly-fishing. During recesses, his fellow correspondents remember him typing detective novels (the central character was a Downing Street security man named after a fellow correspondent, David Holmes) and tying flies. </p> <p>Voss Bark left the press gallery in the early 1970s and, needing to work beyond the age of 60, joined a public relations company, Charles Barker City, for whom he lobbied MPs on behalf of trawlermen, among others. He rejoined the Times as fly-fishing correspondent, a post he held for 12 years, and brought out a string of books in his 70s and 80s on the art of catching trout and salmon. </p> <p>He gave courses at the Arundell Arms, Lifton, Devon, a famous fishing hotel with several trout streams; it was owned by his fourth wife, Anne Fox-Edwards. He taught the art to many celebrities, and once broke off a phone call with the words: \"I'm sorry, the poet laureate's here for his lesson.\" </p> <p>He leaves his wife, and two sons and daughters from his second marriage. </p> <p>\u0095 Conrad Lyddon Voss-Bark, journalist and fly-fishing enthusiast, born March 9 1913; died November 23 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Conrad Voss Bark, who has died at the age of 87, was a household name throughout the 1950s and 1960s - not just because of his memorable surname, but because he was a daily presence on Radio Newsreel, news bulletins and, later, television news, reporting parliament as the BBC's gallery correspondent. He joined the corporation from the Times in 1951, and was one of a team of only three men; initially, there was no lobby correspondent. Voss Bark was born near Hull, and educated at Hymer's College, Hull, and Bristol grammar school. He was a Quaker and, during the blitz, was injured while serving in a mobile ambulance unit. He was a sub-editor by training, and, having worked on the Hampstead News and the Western Daily Press in the era of newsprint rationing, had learned how to make words count. This gift for concision, for taking complex political issues and turning them into a terse and simple narrative, served him well. He often had to broadcast live, without a teleprompter, and at short notice, from his shorthand notes. Once, while reporting a speech by the Labour leader, Hugh Gaitskell, after leaving the Commons chamber at the last moment, Voss Bark said on air: \"I'm sorry, I can't read my shorthand . . .\" He recovered, and made the rest up, but thought that he would get the sack - only to discover that millions of listeners had enjoyed the human drama. The phone lines to Broadcasting House were jammed with messages of sympathy and congratulations, largely from shorthand typists. Voss Bark had a famous ability to edit his notes as he went along, only taking down essentials; he once won fame with his colleagues by taking down the whole of a Budget speech on one side of a sheet of foolscap. His secret was knowing which bits would not interest the listener. He covered stirring times - the end of the Churchill government, the Suez crisis, the arrival of women life peers in 1958, the era of Harold Wilson's premiership and the Commons debate on the American bombing of Hanoi. Voss Bark always gave an impression of tightlipped unflapability, reliable and authoritative. But he could get excited, and convey that excitement - as when he came out of the gallery, after hearing Bernadette Devlin's maiden speech, to proclaim that she was \"just like Joan of Arc\". He was never told by editors what to say, but often came under political pressure, particularly during the Suez crisis, when rightwing Conservatives objected to the BBC reporting the deep divisions in parliamentary and public opinion. An internal BBC inquiry cleared him of bias. He did once fall foul of his editors. He had listened to the Conservative home secretary, RA Butler, giving an involved and equivocating set of answers about a possible inquiry into the case of a man hanged for murder. Conrad summed up his report by saying that Butler had given a \"non-committal reply\" - and got a rocket from his editor. Irritated by the response, he showed his script to Butler, who agreed it was fair comment because he had intended to be non-committal. Voss Bark would enjoy telling colleagues about the hair-raising early days of BBC televison news at Alexandra Palace, to which he was sent as a sub-editor from Egton House. Early broadcasts, dubbed \"the magic lantern show\" by the press, consisted of stills with an off-screen voice. Conrad would be given three hours' notice that he was to read the news that night. There was no training, little rehearsal and no teleprompt. He was told not to say good evening, or smile. He was not allowed to change the script. After a few months, he escaped to the Commons press gallery. His private passion was fly-fishing. During recesses, his fellow correspondents remember him typing detective novels (the central character was a Downing Street security man named after a fellow correspondent, David Holmes) and tying flies. Voss Bark left the press gallery in the early 1970s and, needing to work beyond the age of 60, joined a public relations company, Charles Barker City, for whom he lobbied MPs on behalf of trawlermen, among others. He rejoined the Times as fly-fishing correspondent, a post he held for 12 years, and brought out a string of books in his 70s and 80s on the art of catching trout and salmon. He gave courses at the Arundell Arms, Lifton, Devon, a famous fishing hotel with several trout streams; it was owned by his fourth wife, Anne Fox-Edwards. He taught the art to many celebrities, and once broke off a phone call with the words: \"I'm sorry, the poet laureate's here for his lesson.\" He leaves his wife, and two sons and daughters from his second marriage. \u0095 Conrad Lyddon Voss-Bark, journalist and fly-fishing enthusiast, born March 9 1913; died November 23 2000",

Sliding into his prestigious morning slot is Jo Whiley, gaining an extra hour over her current lunchtime show. </p> <p>Whiley is the embodiment of modern Radio 1. She is female, knows her music, likes a drink - Jack Daniels, by preference - and doesn't appear to be using pop radio as a pathway to primetime ITV game shows. Better yet, she's a mother, and Radio 1 has been accused in the past of having an unstated policy that raising kids and DJing were incompatible pursuits for its women presenters. And she has paid her dues: she started off booking bands (Nirvana, most famously) for The Word, then co-presented Radio 1's evening show with Steve Lamacq before advancing to daytime. </p> <p>She's no Big Breakfast bit of attitude-heavy fluff, then. But in case you didn't know that, her current show is carefully signposted for hipper fanboys. It's called the Lunchtime Social, a knowing nod to legendary 90s Sunday club bash the Heavenly Social, and the weekly \"tip for the top\" is referred to as the Pet Sound. This is daytime radio for the post-Nick Hornby generation. </p> <p>Yet the news that Whiley is being promoted won't be greeted with unqualified joy across the land. She certainly has more than her share of admirers: teen girl magazines adore her, and the Elle and Guardian readers who voted her most stylish female presenter of 1999. But there are also the doubters. It was just the little things at first: the excessive matiness, announcing that she's \"well chuffed\" to meet David Bowie. The odd mannerisms, notably a tendency to find novel ways of pronouncing names: Nate Dogg was rendered \"Nat-ay Dogg\", which isn't a crime, but was curious because being a hip-hop type he kept bigging himself up on the record. Incidental at first, this kind of thing becomes mesmerising when repeated day after day after day. </p> <p>But it was the Jo Whiley Show on Channel 4 that made her a public figure. The Observer described it as an \"abysmal promotional tool where stars lounge on sofas and show how inarticulate, self-obsessed and crass they can be\". </p> <p>Which, in itself, is not Whiley's fault. Bringing assorted pop stars together for a discussion was a loser from the start for the simple reason that pop stars tend not to be too bright. They have other attributes. </p> <p>Thus Melanie B meeting Shaznay from All Saints is never going to produce intellectual fireworks along the lines of Hazlitt vs Coleridge, or even Timothy Leary vs G Gordon Liddy. And at least that had the prospect of a scrap (didn't happen). Line-ups like Bj\u00f6rk, Jay Kay and Karl Hyde from Underworld could offer the occasional moment of madness at most. But Jo Whiley doesn't help. If Simon Le Bon isn't Tom Paulin (it works both ways of course: Paulin never got to have cocaine orgies on yachts and marry a supermodel), then Jo isn't Mark Lawson. There is a special talent for stimulating and controlling a round-table discussion, and she doesn't quite have it. </p> <p>Perhaps her early days working on The Word haunt her, because she seems to have inherited Terry Christian's mastery of the prepared non-sequitur. Just as a debate seems like it might be drifting into life, Whiley breaks in with the unrelated next question on her list, killing the conversation dead. More contentious were the feet. Bare feet have mixed success in the modern era: they worked for Sandie Shaw, but not for Zola Budd. You can't miss Whiley's either, because she sits with them up on her chair, presumably inviting her guests to feel like they are in her living room, and not in a badly designed TV set. </p> <p>Still, there is no doubt that she cares about the music. The TV show has had live performances from bands unlikely to get coverage elsewhere, including a blistering outing from Ralph Nader-loving agit pop crew Company Flow. And on the radio show she plays stuff you wouldn't normally expect to hear on daytime Radio 1, even after the big shake-ups of the Matthew Bannister era. But, in fairness to them, a lot of the Smashy &amp; Nicey types genuinely loved their music too. Mike Read would stick his neck out for bands such as The Icicle Works. Dave Lee Travis, for all his all-too apparent flaws, loved soul, and John Peel has conceded that in the early 70s, Tony Blackburn was getting it right more than he was. </p> <p>And these days, Radio 1 has no need to be defensive about its roster. In fact, the station is bursting with figures who have had a profound impact on what this country listens to: the likes of Danny Rampling, Pete Tong, Tim Westwood and Trevor Nelson. The most recent additions to this list are the UK garage gurus the Dreem Teem. Like Jo Whiley, the Dreem Teem make Radio 1 executives feel good about themselves.

Every day you have to perform to an audience of people programmed to spot any deviation from the norm, any flicker of insecurity and then remorselessly exploit it. </p> <p>As a child, I used to wonder why teachers left themselves so vulnerable to predators, with their Chris de Burgh haircuts, their jumble-sale clothes, their warts, the blobs of unblended concealer on their noses. When I got older I realised that teachers look like that because they are mostly rather poor and harried. </p> <p>This week's Chris de Burgh haircut had resigned after a campaign of unpleasantness by his pupils. His case was that the school should have given him more support. There was some of the usual stuff - they talked through his lessons, made farting noises every time he sat down and so forth. Then there was a lot of more specific stuff about his clothes and appearance, mostly hilarious drawings on the blackboard and notes requesting romantic assignations signed by Spice Girls. </p> <p>I feel desperately sorry for Mr CdBH. What I am wondering, however, as I think is everyone else in the tribunal, is whether he could not have practised some self-help. He has turned up at the tribunal wearing a three-piece tan corduroy suit with flyaway lapels and flared trousers - from the first time that flares were fashionable. Then there is the unforgivable haircut. And the grey shoes. And the beard with holes in it. </p> <p>My opponent quite rightly sees that it would be unfair to suggest to Mr CdBH that he laid himself open to torment as a result of his aesthetic choices. Not so the tribunal chairman. Having sighed moodily during most of Mr CdBH's evidence, he suddenly bursts out: \"Well, did you not think of having a haircut? Or taking those trousers in at the ankle?\" </p> <p>There is a shocked silence. The chairman seems to realise abruptly that what was in his head has come out of his mouth and gives himself a little shake: \"Yes, well, anyway. Do carry on with your cross-examination.\" </p> <p>It's too late, however. Mr CdBH looks like he has been smacked. He looks like this is worse than his worst classroom experience. Maybe I don't want to be a tribunal chairperson after all.</p>",

When I got older I realised that teachers look like that because they are mostly rather poor and harried. This week's Chris de Burgh haircut had resigned after a campaign of unpleasantness by his pupils. His case was that the school should have given him more support. There was some of the usual stuff - they talked through his lessons, made farting noises every time he sat down and so forth. Then there was a lot of more specific stuff about his clothes and appearance, mostly hilarious drawings on the blackboard and notes requesting romantic assignations signed by Spice Girls. I feel desperately sorry for Mr CdBH. What I am wondering, however, as I think is everyone else in the tribunal, is whether he could not have practised some self-help. He has turned up at the tribunal wearing a three-piece tan corduroy suit with flyaway lapels and flared trousers - from the first time that flares were fashionable. Then there is the unforgivable haircut. And the grey shoes. And the beard with holes in it. My opponent quite rightly sees that it would be unfair to suggest to Mr CdBH that he laid himself open to torment as a result of his aesthetic choices. Not so the tribunal chairman. Having sighed moodily during most of Mr CdBH's evidence, he suddenly bursts out: \"Well, did you not think of having a haircut? Or taking those trousers in at the ankle?\" There is a shocked silence. The chairman seems to realise abruptly that what was in his head has come out of his mouth and gives himself a little shake: \"Yes, well, anyway. Do carry on with your cross-examination.\" It's too late, however. Mr CdBH looks like he has been smacked. He looks like this is worse than his worst classroom experience. Maybe I don't want to be a tribunal chairperson after all.",

Faced with a divorce threat from his wife and mounting debts, he underwent a five-month rehab programme in 1995 and became a devout Christian. Six years after kicking the habit, Kudlow, now 53, is back on Wall Street in a prominent position. So, however, is cocaine. </p> <p>Last week, it was reported that Marc Weill, son of one of the world's most powerful financiers, had left his $2m-a-year job as the investment chief of Citigroup because of a cocaine addiction. The firm, which is run by Weill's father, Sandy, and is the most profitable financial services company on the planet, has refused to talk about his departure, but reports have surfaced of the 44-year-old behaving erratically as the head of the group's $113bn investment portfolio. According to the Wall Street Journal, the father of two, who was known for his 12-hour working days, had been falling asleep during high-level meetings. Last week, his ex-wife admitted he was being treated for addiction. Weill has refused to comment. </p> <p>He is the highest profile Wall Street figure to fall due to alleged cocaine addiction in recent years, but insiders say such high-profile dependency is far from unusual. Other Wall Street firms have been hit by allegations of endemic drug use in the past few months; in one case, a woman who had jointly managed the trading desk of a small brokerage firm with her husband accused the company of using drugs to win business. Her estranged husband's $500-a-day cocaine habit had been condoned for three years by the firm, the woman said, because it helped win business from those willing to take sweeteners in powder form. </p> <p>After almost a decade of unparalleled economic growth, the boom times are back on Wall Street. Cash tills are ringing, furs have returned to the glossy magazines and cocaine, the party drug of the 80s, is back in fashion among the moneyed classes. Although statistics about drug use are difficult to come by, all the anecdotal evidence suggests that after a period out of favour, cocaine use on the trading floor is returning to levels unseen since the days of Gordon Gecko. </p> <p>Cocaine supplies in general have shot up in the past five years, coinciding with a halving in price to about $30 a gramme. According to the US drug enforcement administration, cocaine seizures rose dramatically from 54,881 kilos in 1996 to 84,700 last year and, while America's heaviest drug users are still the poorest members of society, wealthy, white collar workers are not far behind. The most recent National Household Survey found that 10% of the wealthiest members of society - those earning more than $75,000 (\u00a350,000) a year - admitted to using illegal drugs. </p> <p>It is not difficult to appreciate the appeal of cocaine to hardbitten Wall Street execs. The drug, which sends the blood racing around the central nervous system, was described as \"better than taking a four-hour nap\" by one foreign exchange trader. </p> <p>Dr Arnold Washton, a Manhattan-based addiction specialist who set up America's first cocaine hotline in 1982, believes the raging bull market of the past two years has sparked the latest boom. Use of the drug went \"underground\" after it claimed its first wave of high-profile victims at the end of the 80s, says Washton. </p> <p>\"It was almost treated as passe for a while,\" he says, \"but now there is a resurgence. There's a new crop of young, ambitious professionals who find this drug suitable. It fits right in with the tenor of the times.\" About a third of his clients work in senior Wall Street jobs and use the drug to feel more \"energetic, powerful, sexy and on top of the world\". </p> <p>Washton's concern now is that as the US economy shows signs of a long-expected downturn, high-flyers may find themselves increasingly bereft of the ready cash needed to sustain their habit, but no less dependent on the drug. Users who became addicts during the good times will find it difficult to wean themselves off during a slump, when cocaine is used to treat increasing feelings of unworthiness or depression, says Washton. </p> <p>Lawrence Kudlow's rehabilitation appears to be complete, after being appointed as the chief economist at ING Barings earlier this year. But with some observers speculating that Weill's career may be finished, Kudlow advises caution to those seduced by belief in their own invincibility. \"I have never blamed Wall Street,\" he says. \"It's an attitude, not the pressure.

      "body": "<p>When Mikhail Pletnev is really up for it, he has few peers among the pianists of today, and his recital at the Barbican on Sunday evening was one of those precious occasions. In a published programme of Beethoven and Chopin - two sonatas followed by the four scherzos - he displayed all the facets of his exceptional keyboard command and intense musicality, and very few of the mannerisms that he sometimes substitutes. </p> <p>The interpretative decisions he makes do not always correspond with received opinion, and when taken in isolation some can seem even self- conscious; he needs the audience to trust his instincts, and to follow where he is going. On this occasion they were handsomely rewarded. </p> <p>He began unassumingly with the modest G major Sonata, Op 14 no 2, treating the opening theme almost rhapsodically, before steadily accelerating through the development. The Waldstein Sonata, though, was immediately on a different plane, full of teeming detail, ravishing dynamic effects and an iron grip on the trajectory of the whole work, which did not slacken even when the last movement was marred by a fire alarm that resounded through the hall for several minutes.

      "bodyText": "When Mikhail Pletnev is really up for it, he has few peers among the pianists of today, and his recital at the Barbican on Sunday evening was one of those precious occasions. In a published programme of Beethoven and Chopin - two sonatas followed by the four scherzos - he displayed all the facets of his exceptional keyboard command and intense musicality, and very few of the mannerisms that he sometimes substitutes. The interpretative decisions he makes do not always correspond with received opinion, and when taken in isolation some can seem even self- conscious; he needs the audience to trust his instincts, and to follow where he is going. On this occasion they were handsomely rewarded. He began unassumingly with the modest G major Sonata, Op 14 no 2, treating the opening theme almost rhapsodically, before steadily accelerating through the development. The Waldstein Sonata, though, was immediately on a different plane, full of teeming detail, ravishing dynamic effects and an iron grip on the trajectory of the whole work, which did not slacken even when the last movement was marred by a fire alarm that resounded through the hall for several minutes. This was Pletnev recreating Beethoven's musical world unambiguously in terms of the modern Steinway grand, in all its Technicolor glory. His way with Chopin was equally revelatory. Though the precision of the playing was never in doubt, there was little conventional barnstorming even in the wracked intensity of the B flat minor and C sharp minor scherzos, yet energy coursed through every bar. Perspectives constantly changed, and even in the more reflective passages - the flourishes that punctuate the second theme of the C sharp minor for instance - Pletnev was able to indicate the drama beneath the surface in the way he shaped incidental detail and gave it an indelible inflection.
