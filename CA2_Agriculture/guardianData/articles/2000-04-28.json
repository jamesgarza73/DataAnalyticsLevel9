      "body": "<p>Savers with less than \u00a35,000 have little reason to look at high street banks and building societies. The top rates on \u00a31 plus in a straightforward instant access account, with no restrictions on the number and size of withdrawals you make each year, come from internet banks. </p> <p>Egg, set up by the Prudential, is paying a flat 6.3% gross on all balances to a maximum \u00a3250,000. Dublin-based first-e, which is outside Britain's bank consumer protection scheme, is paying 6.31%. </p> <p>These rates compare with an average instant access gross rate on the high street of around 1.51%, according to Moneyfacts - and many of these require higher minimum deposits or impose withdrawal restrictions. </p> <p>So should we all be switching to internet banking? The answer has to be a qualified yes. It's cheaper for banks to run internet-based savings accounts - estimated to be around a 10th of the cost of running a branch network and a quarter that of running a call centre-based operation. So banks can afford to pass on savings. </p> <p>This means savers can expect very competitive and, in many instances, chart-topping rates from internet-only savings accounts. </p> <p>But it does not mean that over the long term you can expect bank rate-busting interest levels like those on offer from Egg and first-e. These rates are loss leaders to attract customers to new internet banks. And once a big enough customer base has been built, they will fall to a more realistic level. </p> <p>\"At the moment, our internet-only savings account rate is positioned to acquire customers,\" says an Egg spokesperson. </p> <p>Egg has built up some 600,000 savings customers. Its rival, first-e, has as yet a smaller customer base. Its declared aim is to get 200,000 customers across Europe by the end of the year.

      "bodyText": "Savers with less than \u00a35,000 have little reason to look at high street banks and building societies. The top rates on \u00a31 plus in a straightforward instant access account, with no restrictions on the number and size of withdrawals you make each year, come from internet banks. Egg, set up by the Prudential, is paying a flat 6.3% gross on all balances to a maximum \u00a3250,000. Dublin-based first-e, which is outside Britain's bank consumer protection scheme, is paying 6.31%. These rates compare with an average instant access gross rate on the high street of around 1.51%, according to Moneyfacts - and many of these require higher minimum deposits or impose withdrawal restrictions. So should we all be switching to internet banking? The answer has to be a qualified yes. It's cheaper for banks to run internet-based savings accounts - estimated to be around a 10th of the cost of running a branch network and a quarter that of running a call centre-based operation. So banks can afford to pass on savings. This means savers can expect very competitive and, in many instances, chart-topping rates from internet-only savings accounts. But it does not mean that over the long term you can expect bank rate-busting interest levels like those on offer from Egg and first-e. These rates are loss leaders to attract customers to new internet banks. And once a big enough customer base has been built, they will fall to a more realistic level. \"At the moment, our internet-only savings account rate is positioned to acquire customers,\" says an Egg spokesperson. Egg has built up some 600,000 savings customers. Its rival, first-e, has as yet a smaller customer base. Its declared aim is to get 200,000 customers across Europe by the end of the year. It is still very much in the growth stage, so it is not likely to drop its loss leader rate just yet. But the choice of high-interest internet-only savings accounts is still surprisingly limited, though more are expected to come on stream over the next few months. Virtually all high-street banks and building societies now have their own internet websites, and many of the larger institutions, including Lloyds TSB, NatWest, Barclays, Halifax and Nationwide, now offer online banking to their customers. But very few offer separate internet-only accounts. The notable exception is the Co-op Bank's Smile, offering a full range of internet-only banking products, including the only internet-exclusive cash Isa, which pays 6.75%. Smile pays 4.5% gross on its savings account, plus a 1% bonus, bringing the current rate up to 5.5% if you are also a Smile current account holder. Aside from these three existing internet banks, just five other institutions - the Royal Bank of Scotland, and four building societies, Norwich &amp; Peterborough, Skipton, Lambeth and Market Harborough - currently offer an internet-only savings product. There are high-interest alternatives, although these come with restrictions. Northern Rock's base rate tracker account, paying 6.5% gross on \u00a31 plus, is the only one to beat Egg's and first-e's rates on smaller balances, but holders are allowed no more than six withdrawals a year and minimum transactions of \u00a3250. For those with a deposit of \u00a35,000 or more, Bristol &amp; West's postal and telephone account Call One, paying a flat 6.55% gross on \u00a35,000, does offer a better deal, though this rate includes a 1% bonus only guaranteed until June 1.",

Simon Bunn, 32, opened his account just over a month ago. He was keen to save \u00a320 a month into it and filled in a direct debit form so that this amount would be regularly transferred from his main bank account. </p> <p>On April 12, when he logged on to check the \u00a320 had gone in, he was \"flabbergasted\" to see just over \u00a3303,000 sitting in his account. </p> <p>Mr Bunn sat there trying to work out what on earth had happened. Then it dawned on him that the figure paid in was the same as his main bank account number. What seemed to have happened was that the person processing his direct debit form had mistakenly keyed his account number into the value field instead of inputting \"\u00a320\". </p> <p>\"In the end I realised it was not 'real money' - it didn't come from someone's account. It was just a silly mistake really. But it was annoying. I was up until the early hours fretting over it, thinking 'What am I going to do?' All kinds of things were going through my mind. </p> <p>\"I sent them an email to say 'What's happening?' \" </p> <p>Egg took the money out of his account on April 13. As the \u00a3303,000 had sat there for four days, Mr Bunn argued he should receive four days' worth of interest on this amount - about \u00a3200 - as a reward for his promptness in reporting the mistake. Instead, Egg offered him \u00a320, which he accepted. </p> <p>\"They did apologise. They said they were glad I'd realised,\" says Mr Bunn, of Worthing, West Sussex, who works in the finance depart ment of a marketing company. \"However, if they are going to make a silly mistake with an amount that large, they should face some kind of penalty charge.\" He was particularly surprised about the error bearing in mind that the maximum amount you can supposedly have in an Egg account is \u00a3250,000. </p> <p>The experience has left Mr Bunn somewhat jaded and he is considering switching to Smile, the rival internet bank, which is offering a cash mini individual savings account paying 7.25%. </p> <p>An Egg spokeswoman describes the incident as a one-off. \"We're still looking into it,\" she adds. When someone opens an Egg savings account, they are sent a welcome pack which includes a form to set up a direct debit. \"We haven't found the original form yet. In the absence of that we will assume it was an admin error on our part.\" </p> <p>This isn't the first time that cracks have appeared in Egg's market-leading products. In December Jobs &amp; Money revealed that the company had to reimburse scores of customers of its credit card after delays in processing transactions led to people being hit with penalty charges. </p> <p>Other companies have also experienced problems with their online offerings. In November, the Halifax was forced to temporarily close its internet share-dealing service after a technical glitch led to worries that some customers had been able to access other people's accounts. </p> <p>The Egg incident coincides with a warning from the Consumers' Association, which claims people should \"think very carefully\" before opening a savings account with internet bank First-e because it has not signed up to the UK's banking code of practice, and also doesn't belong to our banking ombudsman scheme. </p> <p>First-e (<a href=\"http://www.first-e.com\">www.first-e.com</a>) a division of the French bank Banque d'Escompte, was launched last autumn and offers one of the highest no-notice savings rates on the market - 6.81% gross on balances of \u00a31 upwards. </p> <p>First-e says it would be delighted to subscribe to the banking code of practice and be part of the ombudsman regime, but under the UK rules this is not allowed.

You can buy a new Friends Provident regular savings plan for just \u00a335 per month, or a lump-sum investment bond for \u00a33,000, according to finanical advisers Chartwell Investment Management of Bath. Both products are invested in the with-profits fund, which means that the saver is almost guaranteed a pay out if the mutual converts. </p> <p>But is it worth it? The headline figures of huge pay outs will be reserved for investors who have been putting \u00a3100 a month into a personal pension for the last 20 years. So those who jump on the bandwagon this week may see only a payout of a few hundred pounds - and they may have to wait two years before they see the cash. </p> <p>Which is why carpetbagging resolutions, such as the one at Friends Provident, tend to include a clause demanding that the life office sets a minimum payout figure of \u00a31,000. If the carpetbaggers are successful on this front, then the \u00a335-per-month policy held for two years (a total investment of \u00a3840) does indeed produce a very healthy return. </p> <p>The Financial Services Authority has issued stern warnings against advisers who select your pension provider on the basis of a possible windfall, as the potential payout is insignificant compared to the impact of investment performance, charges and commission. </p> <p>And the tide does not always run in favour of carpetbaggers. Skipton and Chelsea building societies both saw off the windfall hunters in ballots this week.</p>",

You can buy a new Friends Provident regular savings plan for just \u00a335 per month, or a lump-sum investment bond for \u00a33,000, according to finanical advisers Chartwell Investment Management of Bath. Both products are invested in the with-profits fund, which means that the saver is almost guaranteed a pay out if the mutual converts. But is it worth it? The headline figures of huge pay outs will be reserved for investors who have been putting \u00a3100 a month into a personal pension for the last 20 years. So those who jump on the bandwagon this week may see only a payout of a few hundred pounds - and they may have to wait two years before they see the cash. Which is why carpetbagging resolutions, such as the one at Friends Provident, tend to include a clause demanding that the life office sets a minimum payout figure of \u00a31,000. If the carpetbaggers are successful on this front, then the \u00a335-per-month policy held for two years (a total investment of \u00a3840) does indeed produce a very healthy return. The Financial Services Authority has issued stern warnings against advisers who select your pension provider on the basis of a possible windfall, as the potential payout is insignificant compared to the impact of investment performance, charges and commission. And the tide does not always run in favour of carpetbaggers. Skipton and Chelsea building societies both saw off the windfall hunters in ballots this week.",

A special meeting to vote on demutualisation will be held within the next three months. </p> <p>Standard Life will write to members in the next few days to give more details, and says it will be vigorously putting the case for mutuality. \"We see our future as a strong mutual group run purely for our members,\" says chairman John Trott. </p> <p>Will the policyholders see it that way, with the carrot of windfalls of perhaps \u00a35,000-\u00a36,000 dangling before them? Bradford &amp; Bingley building society was the last big mutual to allow members to vote on demutualisation while opposing such a move, and we all know what happened to them: a majority of members voted to take the money, and the society is now converting. </p> <p>Speculation that Standard Life could face an uphill battle in fending off the carpetbaggers was fuelled by the disclosure that a poll by the insurer two months ago found that more policyholders favoured conversion to a plc than supported it staying member-owned (25.5% and 23.3% respectively). </p> <p>However, half the 1,500 policyholders quizzed were undecided, giving both sides in the battle everything to play for in the weeks ahead of the vote. </p> <p>At this week's annual meeting in Edinburgh, some policyholders criticised the company for allowing Mr Woollard to \"set the agenda\". Mark Bolland at financial advisers Chamberlain de Broe probably summed up the feelings of many when he said: \"Having a gun put to their heads is an unsavoury way of doing business.\" </p> <p>Here we answer some of the questions policyholders may have. </p> <p> <strong> Remind me of the background. And who is this Woollard character?</strong> </p> <p> The Standard Life Members' Action Group run by Mr Woollard submitted a conversion resolution two months ago but the insurer rejected this an invalid. On February 9, in a bid to foil the carpetbaggers, the company put in place a number of measures which mean people buying new policies after this date, and possibly some other policyholders too, will not receive any windfall resulting from a demutualisation within the next three years . The action group this week submitted five new resolutions which the company said appeared to be valid. Mr Woollard is an Australian national and a former fund manager who started buying up second-hand Standard Life endowment policies two years ago. </p> <p> <strong> The $64,000 dollar question: how much might I get?</strong> </p> <p> According to Mr Woollard, flotation could see the company valued at up to \u00a315bn and potentially deliver average windfalls of \u00a35,000-\u00a36,300 to each qualifying policyholder. He proposes everyone should get a fixed handout of shares worth \u00a3500, plus a variable handout worth around 40%-50% of the surrender value of their policy. So someone with a policy with a surrender value of \u00a310,000 could be looking at a payout of \u00a3500 plus \u00a34,000-\u00a35,000 which is equal to \u00a34,500-\u00a35,500. </p> <p>Standard Life says it is impossible to say what any windfalls might be worth because it has not decided how any distribution would be made, and no one knows what the state of the stock market will be if and when it floats. </p> <p> <strong> So who would benefit?</strong> </p> <p> While it is thought that one in five UK adults holds a Standard Life policy of some sort, only the 2.3m people with qualifying \"with-profits\" policies would get a payout. They are people who own products such as endowment policies, personal pensions and with-profits savings plans. Standard Life unit trust investors and those with Standard Life Bank products will not qualify. </p> <p>However, those whose policies are not with-profits may be comforted by the fact that Norwich Union and Scottish Widows both gave payouts to holders of certain non-with-profits life policies. </p> <p> <strong> What happens now?</strong> </p> <p> A special meeting to vote on demutualisation will be held, probably in June or July. For demutualisation to get the go-ahead two resolutions must be approved. The first proposes a change in the company's rules which would give policyholders more power to direct the board on particular issues, and requires a 75% majority of members voting in favour to succeed. Only if this goes through can the demutualisation proposal, which calls on the board \"to take steps to demutualise the company and convert to a plc,\" be effective. </p> <p>This second resolution requires a 50%-plus majority voting in favour. If both are passed, the company will have to draw up a full demutualisation plan which would then have to be put to another vote of members. </p> <p> <strong> My policy matures next week/next month/later this year. Will I qualify for a windfall?</strong> </p> <p> With a demutualisation likely to take up to two years, quite a few people are worried they will lose out on a windfall because their policy is nearing maturity. </p> <p>Philip Crozier, 45, of Abertillery, near Newport, south Wales, has two Standard Life endowment policies; one matures this September and the other in March 2001. He is concerned that if flotation is after these dates, as seems likely, he will miss out on what could be quite a large windfall. \"I don't think I deserve to lose out after being a loyal customer for 15 years,\" he says. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Mr Crozier and others like him, Standard Life has not yet decided what to do about this issue. \"It's one of the things yet to be resolved,\" says a spokesman. There is a glimmer of hope, however. Insurance giant Sun Life of Canada, which converted to a plc last month, announced that if an eligible policy matured after January 1998, the owner was still entitled to a handout. Standard Life may adopt a similar strategy. </p> <p> <strong> I've bought a second-hand Standard Life endowment policy (known as a traded endowment or \"Tep\"). Will I get a windfall?</strong> </p> <p> Hmm, this is a bit of a thorny one. Earlier this year the company prompted an outcry when it indicated it might refuse to pay windfalls to owners of second-hand endowment policies if it is forced to demutualise. </p> <p>This week it attempted to clarify the position but has left many people confused and angry.

Is this true?</strong> </p> <p> This is an issue the company admits has been causing a lot of concern. The facts are these: if you want to pay more into a policy (a personal pension, for example), you will be able to do this, and it won't jeopardise any windfall you might receive. But you will have to sign a form which means you won't be entitled to a handout on any extra that you invest. </p> <p>In other words, by signing the form, you don't sign away all your rights to a payout.</p>",

Only one in five of the 2.3m policyholders stood a chance of getting such a windfall, he said. </p> <p>The payout claims were made by Fred Woollard, the Monaco-based fund manager who has led the campaign for the vote. Mr Woollard, who founded the Standard Life Members' Action Group, forced Barclays, which has inadvertently been dragged in to the battle, into clarifying the independence of three endowment funds which are backing the rebel group. </p> <p>Matt Barrett, the Barclays chief executive, yesterday wrote to Mr Bell to express his \"regret that our name has been used to give the false appearance that Barclays plc has backed the campaign by Mr Woollard. Personally I find this an unacceptable distortion of the facts\". </p> <p>Barclays Global Investors, the fund management arm which advised the endowment funds, also plans to ask the funds to remove the Barclays name from their titles. </p> <p>Standard Life, which faces a hefty bill for promoting mutuality, said the long-term interests of the company and its policyholders \"are under threat from opportunists only interested in a quick profit\". But analysts said it could face an uphill battle persuading policyholders to reject the lure of a four-figure windfall in favour of the less tangible benefits of mutuality, even with the 75% majority vote required. Independent life insurance analyst Ned Cazalet said: \"I think Standard Life is going to find a great deal of difficulty in mustering significant numbers of people to turn down money.\" </p> <p>Mr Bell said it was the board's unanimous view that staying member-owned was in the best interests of the company, and that demutualisation would \"damage\" it. \"As a mutual, Standard Life has delivered significantly better payouts overall than plc competitors,\" he added. </p> <p>For the first time, the company has hit back at the carpetbaggers' estimates of potential windfalls with figures of its own. But it did not explicitly state that policyholders would be financially worse-off as a result of any demutualisation, claiming instead that policyholders benefited from \"excellent performance and customer service\" because as a mutual, it was free from the shareholders demands to generate profit. </p> <p>Over the coming weeks the insurer is likely to be haunted by a remark made by finance director Iain Lumsden 10 months ago, which appeared to suggest policyholders would gain more from a flotation than they would lose by having to share some of the profits with shareholders.</p>",

The payout claims were made by Fred Woollard, the Monaco-based fund manager who has led the campaign for the vote. Mr Woollard, who founded the Standard Life Members' Action Group, forced Barclays, which has inadvertently been dragged in to the battle, into clarifying the independence of three endowment funds which are backing the rebel group. Matt Barrett, the Barclays chief executive, yesterday wrote to Mr Bell to express his \"regret that our name has been used to give the false appearance that Barclays plc has backed the campaign by Mr Woollard. Personally I find this an unacceptable distortion of the facts\". Barclays Global Investors, the fund management arm which advised the endowment funds, also plans to ask the funds to remove the Barclays name from their titles. Standard Life, which faces a hefty bill for promoting mutuality, said the long-term interests of the company and its policyholders \"are under threat from opportunists only interested in a quick profit\". But analysts said it could face an uphill battle persuading policyholders to reject the lure of a four-figure windfall in favour of the less tangible benefits of mutuality, even with the 75% majority vote required. Independent life insurance analyst Ned Cazalet said: \"I think Standard Life is going to find a great deal of difficulty in mustering significant numbers of people to turn down money.\" Mr Bell said it was the board's unanimous view that staying member-owned was in the best interests of the company, and that demutualisation would \"damage\" it. \"As a mutual, Standard Life has delivered significantly better payouts overall than plc competitors,\" he added. For the first time, the company has hit back at the carpetbaggers' estimates of potential windfalls with figures of its own. But it did not explicitly state that policyholders would be financially worse-off as a result of any demutualisation, claiming instead that policyholders benefited from \"excellent performance and customer service\" because as a mutual, it was free from the shareholders demands to generate profit. Over the coming weeks the insurer is likely to be haunted by a remark made by finance director Iain Lumsden 10 months ago, which appeared to suggest policyholders would gain more from a flotation than they would lose by having to share some of the profits with shareholders.",

The NUS delivered this verdict to the House of Commons select committee on education and employment earlier this month. Anecdotal evidence from around the country bears out this view, with students - even those who applied on time with all the right evidence of family income, including parental tax returns in order - finding themselves without loans when they arrived at university. A significant number were still without money at Christmas and in the worst cases did not get cheques until February, halfway through the academic year and well beyond the time of biggest expense in the first term, when most books are bought. Students who had taken gap years were often those who waited longest, since they had been abroad at application time and councils were not sufficiently organised to handle applications before the gap-year travellers took to the air. Universities' hardship funds provided help where loans were late. The confusion was worse because local authorities did not always complete means-testing in time and the government told the Student Loans Company to make payments on the basis that students were entitled to full loans.

Pensions experts claim the chances of the target market buying into stakeholder is remote - no matter how much is spent on advertising. Stakeholder pensions are aimed at those earning \u00a39,000 to \u00a318,000 a year - a band that ranges from below half national average earnings to typical salaries. But the reality is that many will do better spending the money at the pub or bookies than handing it over to a pensions firm, as any pension may be reduced pound-for-pound by the withdrawal of welfare benefits. There are positives about the new scheme. Its lower charges will increase retirement earnings for those who are on above average salaries and for the self-employed because costs are to be driven down. And at the very top, ultra-rich company directors will take advantage of loopholes in the rules to buy tax-benefit boosted pension provision above the current maximum \u00a391,800 earnings cap. Stakeholder pensions are a government initiative to increase the attractions of personal pensions. Firms with five or more employees must offer a scheme. They will feature: \u0095 Overall charges limited to 1% a year with no upfront fees; \u0095 A minimum \u00a320 contribution; \u0095 No penalties for irregular amounts or missed months; \u0095 Anyone can have one, irrespective of earnings.

This totals 2.8m - and some 2m of these were forced into early retirement. </p> <p>The government reckons early retirement costs \u00a316bn a year. This includes up to \u00a35bn in benefit payments and lost taxes - equal to around 2p on basic-rate income tax.

It is also proposed that this group should be forced to sign on regularly to prove they are actively seeking employment. </p> <p>The law will not be able to prevent those who can afford it quitting work early. The government plans to enforce its minimum pension age by banning the tax-free lump sum and other Inland Revenue benefits on pension plans which are cashed in before holders reach 55.

However, it seems certain that once the legislation is changed, future policies will reflect retirement at 55. </p> <p>The political drive to push up retirement ages contrasts strongly with the situation in the mid-80s when mass unemployment was more of an issue. Only a decade and a half ago the then Conservative government proposed retirement at 50 as part of its plan to popularise the personal pensions it introduced in 1988. Until then the precursor to personal pensions (retirement annuity policies) had banned drawing a retirement income until 60. Most occupational pensions were based on 65 for a man, 60 for a woman. </p> <p>Generous workplace pension schemes have been the main driver behind early retirement. Someone leaving work aged 55 or 50 may be little worse off than if they had carried on in employment once national insurance, tax and expenses of employment such as travel and clothes plus state and other benefits are balanced against earnings loss. Even where companies do not allow retirement before 60 or 65, employees can leave by switching their accumulated company benefits into a personal pension - a transfer that some financial advisers push as a controversial way of paying off credit card debts. </p> <p>Early retirement may also be a corporate euphemism for redundancy. It can be cheaper for companies to use surpluses in the pension fund to slash its older workforce than to pay younger employees redundancy. </p> <p>There is also a need for everyone to carry on earning and making pension contributions if retirement pensions are going to provide a half decent return. </p> <p>Research from investment bank Barclays Capital shows that by 2010, when the government hopes people will defer retirement by at least five years and preferably more, there could be a pensions asset crunch. The ageing population will see us all saving madly in pension schemes which buy shares, then all selling them madly when we retire. The result? A huge sell-off on the stock market. </p> <p>Tim Bond of Barclays says: \"As saving turns to spending, asset prices will fall because those selling the equities do not have enough purchasers from the next generation to soak up the supply. If that happens, prices slump and pension pots are worth less. At the same time, a big surge of people cashing in on their pensions will bring a new wave of demand for government stocks which are now rarely issued and so suffer from low supply. This will force annuity rates downwards on sums which are themselves less than they might otherwise be.\" </p> <p>Two things could help avoid this. One is a decrease in the dependency ratio - the number of retired people compared with those in work - by increasing retirement ages and making it more attractive to stay at work. </p> <p>A second would be growth in the economy. \"If the government is serious about winning the generation game,\" says Mr Bond, \"then there are unexploited opportunities.

Possibly the best starting place is the UK Social Investment Forum (<a href=\"http://www.uksif.org\">www.uksif.org</a>) the body responsible for the promotion of all aspects of ethical investment in the country. </p> <p>The UKSIF site provides a comprehensive who's who and what's what of the UK ethical investment scene. Ethically minded investors can now also take advantage of a number of specialist websites that give information about the ethical record of companies that might appear in their portfolio of investments and pensions. </p> <p>With a database consisting of the majority of the UK's and the world's biggest companies, <a href=\"http://www.corporate-register.com\">www.corporate-register.com</a> is able to tell you whether or not a company has an ethical or environmental policy. </p> <p>Corporate Critic on the other hand (<a href=\"http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/corporat.htm\">www.ethicalconsumer.org/corporat.htm</a>) is the only online database giving details of a company's ethical and environmental record. With changes in the pension law in July requiring occupational pension funds to state their policy on socially responsible investment, occupational pension holders might like to visit <a href=\"http://www.ethicsforuss.org.uk\">www.ethicsforuss.org.uk</a> which indicates how pension holders can challenge trustees to adopt a socially responsible investment policy. </p> <p>A similar approach to corporate responsibility is advocated by the Shareholder Action Service (<a href=\"http://www.thesasuk.com\">www.thesasuk.com</a>) which lobbies companies on behalf of concerned shareholders. </p> <p>But compared with the US, British shareholder activism and the ethical investment movement in general are in their infancy. </p> <p>With billions of dollars under ethical management, the US is home to specialist funds such as the Pride Fund (<a href=\"http://www.pridefund.com\">www.pridefund.com</a>) which invests only in companies with progressive gay and lesbian policies, and the Women's Equity Mutual Fund (<a href=\"http://www.womens-equity.com\">www.womens-equity.com</a>) which limits investment to public companies which have an affirmative women's policy. </p> <p>Worth noting is Calvert Fund (<a href=\"http://www.calvertgroup.com\">www.calvertgroup.com</a>) whose \"Shareholder Resolution Tool\" has much to teach ethical investors here. </p> <p>You can find ethical independent financial advisers on the UKSIF's list or the Ethical Investors Association site (<a href=\"http://www.ethicalinvestment.org.uk\">www.ethicalinvestment.org.uk</a>). One of the most ambitious online ethical IFAs is Fleetwood Money Advice Consultants - and yes, they call themselves Fleetwood MAC. John Fleetwood says in future \"clients wouldn't necessarily even have to talk to their financial adviser\". </p> <p>Despite these claims, many advisers still see value in doing business over a low-tech cuppa. \"The net can't take the place of meeting clients face-to-face or talking to them over the phone,\" says Brigid Benson of Gaeia Associates (<a href=\"http://www.gaeia.co.uk\">www.gaeia.co.uk</a>) one of the first ethical IFAs on the net. </p> <p>While you'll find a wealth of brochure-style information from ethical IFA websites, there's not much information about individual financial products. This can be remedied by visiting the websites of leading providers such as NPI Global Care (<a href=\"http://www.npi.co.uk/globalcare\">www.npi.co.uk/globalcare</a>), Standard Life Ethical Fund (<a href=\"http://www.standardlifeinvestments.co.uk\">www.standardlifeinvestments.co.uk</a>) and Friends Provident Stewardship Fund (<a href=\"http://www.friendsprovident.co.uk/stewardship\">www.friendsprovident.co.uk/stewardship</a>). </p> <p>Managing your money ethically isn't just restricted to the one-off buying of specific financial products. Your day-to-day financial affairs can also be managed in a more ethical manner. </p> <p>Currently reaping the financial rewards of being the leading ethical bank, the Co-op (<a href=\"http://www.co-operativebank.co.uk\">www.co-operativebank.co.uk</a>) is the obvious choice for those who want to avoid banks with a questionable ethical track record.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The internet is proving to be an invaluable source of information for the would-be ethical investor. Possibly the best starting place is the UK Social Investment Forum (www.uksif.org) the body responsible for the promotion of all aspects of ethical investment in the country. The UKSIF site provides a comprehensive who's who and what's what of the UK ethical investment scene. Ethically minded investors can now also take advantage of a number of specialist websites that give information about the ethical record of companies that might appear in their portfolio of investments and pensions. With a database consisting of the majority of the UK's and the world's biggest companies, www.corporate-register.com is able to tell you whether or not a company has an ethical or environmental policy. Corporate Critic on the other hand (www.ethicalconsumer.org/corporat.htm) is the only online database giving details of a company's ethical and environmental record. With changes in the pension law in July requiring occupational pension funds to state their policy on socially responsible investment, occupational pension holders might like to visit www.ethicsforuss.org.uk which indicates how pension holders can challenge trustees to adopt a socially responsible investment policy. A similar approach to corporate responsibility is advocated by the Shareholder Action Service (www.thesasuk.com) which lobbies companies on behalf of concerned shareholders. But compared with the US, British shareholder activism and the ethical investment movement in general are in their infancy. With billions of dollars under ethical management, the US is home to specialist funds such as the Pride Fund (www.pridefund.com) which invests only in companies with progressive gay and lesbian policies, and the Women's Equity Mutual Fund (www.womens-equity.com) which limits investment to public companies which have an affirmative women's policy. Worth noting is Calvert Fund (www.calvertgroup.com) whose \"Shareholder Resolution Tool\" has much to teach ethical investors here. You can find ethical independent financial advisers on the UKSIF's list or the Ethical Investors Association site (www.ethicalinvestment.org.uk). One of the most ambitious online ethical IFAs is Fleetwood Money Advice Consultants - and yes, they call themselves Fleetwood MAC. John Fleetwood says in future \"clients wouldn't necessarily even have to talk to their financial adviser\". Despite these claims, many advisers still see value in doing business over a low-tech cuppa. \"The net can't take the place of meeting clients face-to-face or talking to them over the phone,\" says Brigid Benson of Gaeia Associates (www.gaeia.co.uk) one of the first ethical IFAs on the net. While you'll find a wealth of brochure-style information from ethical IFA websites, there's not much information about individual financial products. This can be remedied by visiting the websites of leading providers such as NPI Global Care (www.npi.co.uk/globalcare), Standard Life Ethical Fund (www.standardlifeinvestments.co.uk) and Friends Provident Stewardship Fund (www.friendsprovident.co.uk/stewardship). Managing your money ethically isn't just restricted to the one-off buying of specific financial products. Your day-to-day financial affairs can also be managed in a more ethical manner. Currently reaping the financial rewards of being the leading ethical bank, the Co-op (www.co-operativebank.co.uk) is the obvious choice for those who want to avoid banks with a questionable ethical track record.",

      "body": "<p>The rift between Chris Lewis and the England and Wales Cricket Board erupted yesterday into open hostility. </p> <p>Lewis accused the board of \"reinventing events\" after it dismissed his claims that it had procrastinated and covered up information, passed on by him last summer, that three high-profile England cricketers were linked to possible match-rigging and had been paid \"thousands\" in backhanders. </p> <p>The Leicestershire and former England all-rounder was responding to strong criticism from the chairman of the ECB Lord MacLaurin, made in a letter to the county chairmen, in which he described Lewis's assertion as \"unbelievable\". </p> <p>Lewis claimed in a recent newspaper article that he had offered the identities of the three players to the ECB last August when he told it of an approach allegedly made to him by Ashim Kheterpal, an Asian businessman, to act as middleman in a scam to rig a test match between England and New Zealand. Kheterpal has denied the allegation. </p> <p>The board, he said, had dismissed his information concerning the three players as \"hearsay\" and had leaked the story of his meeting with Kheterpal to the News of the World, which had used it as the basis for an article about him that appeared last summer. </p> <p>After a lengthy meeting of its management board yesterday the ECB unequivocally denied the sequence of events that Lewis alleges took place. \"I am satisfied that there is no foundation whatsoever in the idea that those involved at the board were not interested in the information that was made available by Chris Lewis when he first reported the matter on August 3 1999,\" MacLaurin wrote in his letter. </p> <p>\"To suggest that the board did not seek to establish immediately from him the names of England players allegedly involved as soon as this information was divulged is unbelievable.\" </p> <p>But Lewis's agent Gareth James insists that his client stands by his version of events. \"I am absolutely stunned by this letter,\" he said last night. \"It is a complete reinvention of events and it is not over. </p> <p>\"At no stage did the ECB ask for the names of the three England players. Either Lord MacLaurin has been misled or... I hate to think of the other option.\" </p> <p>James called for notes taken during the meeting between his client and the board to be made public. </p> <p>MacLaurin's response, coming after the chairman of the board's discipline standing committee, Gerard Elias QC, had officially cleared all England players past or present of any involvement in match-rigging or bribery, indicated just how much the establishment had been stung by suggestions that it was inept and unwieldy. \"I owe it to everyone associated with the game to answer the criticisms that have been levelled at the board,\" he said. </p> <p>MacLaurin was also scathing over suggestions that the board had leaked information, which it had distributed to a limited number of board members only on a need-to-know basis. \"For the board to have leaked details of this case,\" he said, \"would only have served to undermine the very investigation which it had instigated. The allegations are utterly refuted and I hope this will lay to rest any suspicion that the board has acted improperly.\" </p> <p>MacLaurin has quite rightly ignored calls for Lewis to be hauled up on a disrepute charge and the ferocity of his attack was tempered with a plea for cricketers and public alike to allow the player to continue his career in peace. \"We have no reason to take action against him,\" said the ECB chairman. </p> <p>\"He came to us and it showed a lot of guts to come forward. We do not wish to discourage anybody from coming to us with information that may be important. </p> <p>\"We also have no reason to be embarrassed. We dealt with the situation entirely properly and if we had our time over again we would deal with it in exactly the same fashion. </p> <p>\"It is very sad for sportsmen like Chris to put up with jeers from the fans. He should be allowed to continue his career.\" </p>",

Lewis accused the board of \"reinventing events\" after it dismissed his claims that it had procrastinated and covered up information, passed on by him last summer, that three high-profile England cricketers were linked to possible match-rigging and had been paid \"thousands\" in backhanders. The Leicestershire and former England all-rounder was responding to strong criticism from the chairman of the ECB Lord MacLaurin, made in a letter to the county chairmen, in which he described Lewis's assertion as \"unbelievable\". Lewis claimed in a recent newspaper article that he had offered the identities of the three players to the ECB last August when he told it of an approach allegedly made to him by Ashim Kheterpal, an Asian businessman, to act as middleman in a scam to rig a test match between England and New Zealand. Kheterpal has denied the allegation. The board, he said, had dismissed his information concerning the three players as \"hearsay\" and had leaked the story of his meeting with Kheterpal to the News of the World, which had used it as the basis for an article about him that appeared last summer. After a lengthy meeting of its management board yesterday the ECB unequivocally denied the sequence of events that Lewis alleges took place. \"I am satisfied that there is no foundation whatsoever in the idea that those involved at the board were not interested in the information that was made available by Chris Lewis when he first reported the matter on August 3 1999,\" MacLaurin wrote in his letter. \"To suggest that the board did not seek to establish immediately from him the names of England players allegedly involved as soon as this information was divulged is unbelievable.\" But Lewis's agent Gareth James insists that his client stands by his version of events. \"I am absolutely stunned by this letter,\" he said last night. \"It is a complete reinvention of events and it is not over. \"At no stage did the ECB ask for the names of the three England players. Either Lord MacLaurin has been misled or... I hate to think of the other option.\" James called for notes taken during the meeting between his client and the board to be made public. MacLaurin's response, coming after the chairman of the board's discipline standing committee, Gerard Elias QC, had officially cleared all England players past or present of any involvement in match-rigging or bribery, indicated just how much the establishment had been stung by suggestions that it was inept and unwieldy. \"I owe it to everyone associated with the game to answer the criticisms that have been levelled at the board,\" he said. MacLaurin was also scathing over suggestions that the board had leaked information, which it had distributed to a limited number of board members only on a need-to-know basis. \"For the board to have leaked details of this case,\" he said, \"would only have served to undermine the very investigation which it had instigated. The allegations are utterly refuted and I hope this will lay to rest any suspicion that the board has acted improperly.\" MacLaurin has quite rightly ignored calls for Lewis to be hauled up on a disrepute charge and the ferocity of his attack was tempered with a plea for cricketers and public alike to allow the player to continue his career in peace. \"We have no reason to take action against him,\" said the ECB chairman. \"He came to us and it showed a lot of guts to come forward. We do not wish to discourage anybody from coming to us with information that may be important. \"We also have no reason to be embarrassed. We dealt with the situation entirely properly and if we had our time over again we would deal with it in exactly the same fashion. \"It is very sad for sportsmen like Chris to put up with jeers from the fans. He should be allowed to continue his career.\"",

From today, the BFI at Odeon scheme will commandeer one screen at eight Multiplexes across the UK to showcase films that normally struggle to reach a wider audience. </p> <p>The scheme will concentrate on independently produced British and American pictures, foreign-language film and re-released classics from the past. The first interlopers onto Odeon territory include the Oscar-winning Boys Don't Cry, Jane Campion's Holy Smoke and the reissued A Matter of Life and Death.</p> <p>The BFI at Odeon scheme will be in place for at least the next twelve months. In addition to daily or weekly screenings, the scheme is also planning wider seasons, festivals and retrospectives of the work of such luminaries as Alfred Hitchcock and Humphrey Bogart. Richard Segal, Managing Director of Odeon Cinemas welcomed the scheme: \"Cinema-goers can already go to their local Odeon to see the latest mainstream film titles, but the initiative is about going further - offering people the chance to experiment a little with what they see at the cinema.\"</p> <p>The eight venues earmarked for the scheme are as follows: <br>Odeon Cinema, New Street, Birmingham <br>Odeon Cinema, Westover Road, Bournemouth <br>Odeon Cinema, Winchcombe Road, Cheltenham <br>Odeon Cinema, Upper High Street, Epsom <br>Odeon Cinema, Bedford Road, Guildford <br>Odeon Cinema, St. Margaret's Street, Ipswich <br>Odeon Cinema, London Road, Liverpool <br>Odeon Cinema, Barker Road, Lockmeadow, Maidstone</p>",

      "bodyText": "Once the bastion of all things mainstream, the Odeon chain of cinemas is dipping a toe in the art-house waters in a deal with the BFI. From today, the BFI at Odeon scheme will commandeer one screen at eight Multiplexes across the UK to showcase films that normally struggle to reach a wider audience. The scheme will concentrate on independently produced British and American pictures, foreign-language film and re-released classics from the past. The first interlopers onto Odeon territory include the Oscar-winning Boys Don't Cry, Jane Campion's Holy Smoke and the reissued A Matter of Life and Death. The BFI at Odeon scheme will be in place for at least the next twelve months. In addition to daily or weekly screenings, the scheme is also planning wider seasons, festivals and retrospectives of the work of such luminaries as Alfred Hitchcock and Humphrey Bogart. Richard Segal, Managing Director of Odeon Cinemas welcomed the scheme: \"Cinema-goers can already go to their local Odeon to see the latest mainstream film titles, but the initiative is about going further - offering people the chance to experiment a little with what they see at the cinema.\" The eight venues earmarked for the scheme are as follows: Odeon Cinema, New Street, Birmingham Odeon Cinema, Westover Road, Bournemouth Odeon Cinema, Winchcombe Road, Cheltenham Odeon Cinema, Upper High Street, Epsom Odeon Cinema, Bedford Road, Guildford Odeon Cinema, St. Margaret's Street, Ipswich Odeon Cinema, London Road, Liverpool Odeon Cinema, Barker Road, Lockmeadow, Maidstone",

And he is left-footed, which is an advantage because we don't have many of those.\"</p> <p>Damn right Kevin - if you are talking about a fully-fit Robbie Fowler. </p> <p>Because in this creatine-laden world of modern football - where the prevailing wisdom is that you must possess a sprinter's pace, a boxer's physique or a long-distance runner's stamina to succeed - Robbie Fowler is different. His sharpness of mind, rather than any overwhelming physical attributes, enables him to steal space in even the most crowded of penalty boxes and snatch goals from seemingly impossible situations.</p> <p>In his prime he is the best natural finisher in England. But come Euro 2000 - which starts in just six weeks remember - Robbie Fowler almost certainly won't be in prime condition. And if that's the case why should Keegan choose him ahead of Kevin Phillips or Andy Cole?</p> <p>At the moment the decision is really is that simple, because Keegan has insisted he will only pick five strikers in his 22 man squad. Alan Shearer, Emile Heskey and Michael Owen are certainties. Therefore if Fowler goes, Phillips or Cole won't.</p> <p>But Fowler's fitness and his form at the moment are both open to question. </p> <p>First off, he's been injured most of the past year. When he came on as a substitute for Liverpool at Everton last Friday it was his first game for almost four months, and he also suffered a two-month lay-off earlier in the season. With a record like that, what happens if the ankle goes again during Euro 2000 and England are restricted to only four front-line strikers - or perhaps even three if Michael Owen suffers more hamstring problems.</p> <p>Furthermore, what about Fowler's form? So far he has been restricted to only 11 Premiership matches and three goals this season - during which, by his own admission, he hasn't been at his best (except for a stellar performance against Arsenal). For the most part he looked like he was struggling to get over an injury he suffered at the back-end of last season. Why should his recovery period be any shorter this time round? </p> <p>If Keegan wants to risk bringing Fowler then he must stop boxing himself in, and pick six strikers instead of five. My six would be Alan Shearer, Michael Owen, Kevin Phillips, Emile Heskey, Robbie Fowler and Andy Cole.</p> <p>Alan Shearer picks himself although, as even he seems to realise, he is a forlorn shadow of his former greatness. He shouldn't be a certain starter (but he will be). Michael Owen, who has added closer control to his bewildering pace and accuracy, should be in the first eleven (but isn't certain to be).</p> <p>Emile Heskey is one of Keegan's favourites, and deserves to be in the squad despite being as raw as French steak and possessing the worrying tendency (for a striker especially) to fear the six-yard box as much as an impressionable child frets over the boogieman.</p> <p>I would place Sunderland's Kevin Phillips ahead of Heskey, but despite his phenomenal goal record in the Premiership Keegan doesn't rate him that highly. Fortunately for Phillips, Keegan doesn't trust Cole either, although with his pace and all-round game he should make the squad. And despite my earlier reservations about Fowler's injury and form, I would bring him along too. </p> <p>That makes six strikers, one more than Keegan wants to bring. But the policy makes a lot of sense - Fowler, Phillips and Cole are all much more likely to play a part than Richard Wright or Keegan's eighth choice defender, and there's also the back-up if Fowler or Owen get injured. Finally, if you're still unconvinced, ask yourself this: if England are trailing Holland in the Euro 2000 semi-final who would you want Keegan to bring on - Robbie Fowler or Phillip Neville? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sean.ingle@theguardian.com\">sean.ingle@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Therefore if Fowler goes, Phillips or Cole won't. But Fowler's fitness and his form at the moment are both open to question. First off, he's been injured most of the past year. When he came on as a substitute for Liverpool at Everton last Friday it was his first game for almost four months, and he also suffered a two-month lay-off earlier in the season. With a record like that, what happens if the ankle goes again during Euro 2000 and England are restricted to only four front-line strikers - or perhaps even three if Michael Owen suffers more hamstring problems. Furthermore, what about Fowler's form? So far he has been restricted to only 11 Premiership matches and three goals this season - during which, by his own admission, he hasn't been at his best (except for a stellar performance against Arsenal). For the most part he looked like he was struggling to get over an injury he suffered at the back-end of last season. Why should his recovery period be any shorter this time round? If Keegan wants to risk bringing Fowler then he must stop boxing himself in, and pick six strikers instead of five. My six would be Alan Shearer, Michael Owen, Kevin Phillips, Emile Heskey, Robbie Fowler and Andy Cole. Alan Shearer picks himself although, as even he seems to realise, he is a forlorn shadow of his former greatness. He shouldn't be a certain starter (but he will be). Michael Owen, who has added closer control to his bewildering pace and accuracy, should be in the first eleven (but isn't certain to be). Emile Heskey is one of Keegan's favourites, and deserves to be in the squad despite being as raw as French steak and possessing the worrying tendency (for a striker especially) to fear the six-yard box as much as an impressionable child frets over the boogieman. I would place Sunderland's Kevin Phillips ahead of Heskey, but despite his phenomenal goal record in the Premiership Keegan doesn't rate him that highly. Fortunately for Phillips, Keegan doesn't trust Cole either, although with his pace and all-round game he should make the squad. And despite my earlier reservations about Fowler's injury and form, I would bring him along too. That makes six strikers, one more than Keegan wants to bring. But the policy makes a lot of sense - Fowler, Phillips and Cole are all much more likely to play a part than Richard Wright or Keegan's eighth choice defender, and there's also the back-up if Fowler or Owen get injured. Finally, if you're still unconvinced, ask yourself this: if England are trailing Holland in the Euro 2000 semi-final who would you want Keegan to bring on - Robbie Fowler or Phillip Neville? sean.ingle@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Errol McGowan, one of two black men found hanged in mysterious circumstances in Telford, Shropshire, may have been unwittingly caught up in a turf war between rival drug gangs shortly before he died. Detectives investigating his death initially concentrated on the theory that the 34-year-old might have been the target of racists who had subjected him to two years of abuse, including death threats. They now believe the circumstances surrounding his death on July 2 last year were far more complicated and are investigating whether there is a link between his death and a turf war between white and Asian gangs vying for control of the council estates in the Wellington area of the town. Mr McGowan, a father of three, was known to be fiercely anti-drugs and there is no suggestion that he was personally involved in drug dealing. There is also no doubt that he had suffered severe racial abuse, including death threats, in the months before he died and that the initial police investigation last year was at fault for presuming that he had committed suicide. But Det Supt Mel Shore, who is leading the inquiry, has been forced to widen the scope of the investigation because of revelations about the depth of the drugs problem in the area. The Guardian has learned that one of Mr McGowan's friends was a well-known drug dealer involved in a battle between Asian and white gangs around Regent Street, Urban Gardens and Victoria Avenue. Sources described how Mr McGowan was increasingly unhappy about the involvement of his associates in the drugs scene - it made him a target for both sides - and had even talked about exposing their activities. His discomfort was heightened when a teenager approached him and pleaded for help. The boy was a dealer who thought he was in over his head. Mr McGowan lent him money to leave Telford. A source said: \"The police would be wrong to assume that the abuse Errol was getting was purely down to race. This was not a race issue on its own.

      "trailText": "<p>Almost every week sees the launch of a glossy new cosmetic range. But are they any good?  Jess Cartner-Morley meets legendary make-up artist Bobbi Brown to find out</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Bobbi Brown, premier league make-up artist and global beauty entrepreneur, has a seductive way with words. Expressing her disdain for ugly, clumpy, long-lasting lipsticks, she says she prefers \"lipstick that slowly fades away, so it looks like you've eaten a cherry\". Sitting next to Brown, a tiny woman with a husky voice and clever, twinkIy eyes, you can't help wanting to look like you've eaten a cherry, too. She is persuasive like that. Poetic imagery aside, she has a disarming habit of talking sense - disarming because, in a world in which moisturisers promise eternal youth and perfumes everlasting love, Brown's beauty philosophy has never wavered from her statement that \"women just want to look like themselves, but prettier\". </p> <p>Hardly rocket science, really, but it's got Bobbi Brown a long way. She was one of the first make-up artists to create her own cosmetics range - a move that has been followed by everyone from Francois Nars to Trish McEvoy, from Laura Mercier to Jeannine Lobell. But when it launched in 1991, Brown's range, Bobbi Brown Essentials, was truly an original idea. Strange as it may seem now, hers was the first range based on neutral, skin-toned shades. Foundations and concealers were yellow-based, a truer reflection of most women's complexions than the pink-toned shades that then dominated the counters. There were 10 lipsticks, numbered one to 10, all variations on nude. The range was an instant success and Brown became a familiar figure on television and in magazines. Now the company, which was acquired by Est\u00e9e Lauder in 1996, is in a phase of expansion, with a new range imminent and other projects, such as a teenage how-to book of make-up, in the pipeline. </p> <p>But if the 90s was the decade in which make-up artists made their names, this year has seen a burst of cosmetic activity from another source: designers. Calvin Klein's range, which arrived in Britain in March, was the first to make a major splash but American designers Anna Sui and Vera Wang have both put their names to ranges, with persistent though unconfirmed rumours of plans from Prada. Designers, of course, have a ready-made aspirational image with which to bait women into shelling out for a new blusher. The sleek transparent and silver packaging of Calvin Klein's make-up reflects the sleek, minimal, I-work-in-a-Manhattan-art-gallery image of his clothes, while Anna Sui's swirly boho packaging is a direct cull from her laidback, downtown boutique persona. </p> <p>Brown loves the Calvin Klein packaging but is otherwise unimpressed by designers inching on to her territory. \"I think it's a trend that will be over in a couple of years. All the make-up artists have launched, now the designers are launching. Who's next? Models? Photographers? Editors? Everyone thinks it's easy and it's not that easy. Actually I think I'd have better luck launching clothes. Which I'm not going to do.\" </p> <p>Ranges Brown does like include the professional French range Make Up For Ever, which she adores for its dense pigment. She loves how Chanel make-up is presented (\"They have the best packaging\") and \"could find some good blushers at Clinique\". But generally, she is less than blown away by the make-up on offer today. \"There are plenty of colours out there, but a lot of them make you look silly. No one wants to look silly. And everyone does neutrals now, but most people's neutrals wash out the colour of your face. Mine don't. It's not about taking away colour, it's about the right colour.\" </p> <p>Despite her relationship with research giants Lauder, Brown is uninterested in new technologies: waterproof mascara has got gentler, but there have been few other advances that interest her. \"It's all marketing buzz. What I do is not about that. I stick to what I know,\" says Brown, who has made-up armies of catwalk models in her time. </p> <p>\"Fashion does affect beauty because clothes and make-up need to tie in - velvety fabrics need stronger textured make-up. But the ladylike thing won't work,\" she declares firmly. \"Women don't want to groom any more. No one's going to set their hair.\" </p> <p>One unmissable development that Brown sees as positive is our obsession with celebrity style. \"I think it's healthy because for years there were only models. Models to me are quirks of nature. There are a lot more people who can't see or who can't hear than who look like supermodels. Yes, you have to be attractive to be a celebrity, but at least they're real women.\" </p> <p>Brown's strength is that she has a grown-up, womanly approach to what she does, unmoved by passing fads. It is an attitude not dissimilar to that of Catherine Zeta Jones, who told InStyle magazine recently that one thing she won't do is kooky \"little barrettes in my hair ... something I've never been, never will be, is hip\". </p> <p>Brown, similarly, knows instinctively that for most women a choice between being hip and being beautiful is not a difficult one to make. Still, she has a healthy attitude to the limitations of the beauty industry. \"There are no miracles. The only way you have good skin is if you're born with it. Sorry, but that's how it is.\" </p> <p>A car outside the Madrid hotel is waiting to take Brown, her husband and their sons to start a short holiday in Barcelona. Having completed a make-up demonstration to a group of European journalists, she is now clearly itching to get off. \"I don't think you should spend too much time on this stuff,\" she says. \"You know when you go to a party and everyone's in the bathroom doing their faces?

      "bodyText": "Bobbi Brown, premier league make-up artist and global beauty entrepreneur, has a seductive way with words. Expressing her disdain for ugly, clumpy, long-lasting lipsticks, she says she prefers \"lipstick that slowly fades away, so it looks like you've eaten a cherry\". Sitting next to Brown, a tiny woman with a husky voice and clever, twinkIy eyes, you can't help wanting to look like you've eaten a cherry, too. She is persuasive like that. Poetic imagery aside, she has a disarming habit of talking sense - disarming because, in a world in which moisturisers promise eternal youth and perfumes everlasting love, Brown's beauty philosophy has never wavered from her statement that \"women just want to look like themselves, but prettier\". Hardly rocket science, really, but it's got Bobbi Brown a long way. She was one of the first make-up artists to create her own cosmetics range - a move that has been followed by everyone from Francois Nars to Trish McEvoy, from Laura Mercier to Jeannine Lobell. But when it launched in 1991, Brown's range, Bobbi Brown Essentials, was truly an original idea. Strange as it may seem now, hers was the first range based on neutral, skin-toned shades. Foundations and concealers were yellow-based, a truer reflection of most women's complexions than the pink-toned shades that then dominated the counters. There were 10 lipsticks, numbered one to 10, all variations on nude. The range was an instant success and Brown became a familiar figure on television and in magazines. Now the company, which was acquired by Est\u00e9e Lauder in 1996, is in a phase of expansion, with a new range imminent and other projects, such as a teenage how-to book of make-up, in the pipeline. But if the 90s was the decade in which make-up artists made their names, this year has seen a burst of cosmetic activity from another source: designers. Calvin Klein's range, which arrived in Britain in March, was the first to make a major splash but American designers Anna Sui and Vera Wang have both put their names to ranges, with persistent though unconfirmed rumours of plans from Prada. Designers, of course, have a ready-made aspirational image with which to bait women into shelling out for a new blusher. The sleek transparent and silver packaging of Calvin Klein's make-up reflects the sleek, minimal, I-work-in-a-Manhattan-art-gallery image of his clothes, while Anna Sui's swirly boho packaging is a direct cull from her laidback, downtown boutique persona. Brown loves the Calvin Klein packaging but is otherwise unimpressed by designers inching on to her territory. \"I think it's a trend that will be over in a couple of years. All the make-up artists have launched, now the designers are launching. Who's next? Models? Photographers? Editors? Everyone thinks it's easy and it's not that easy. Actually I think I'd have better luck launching clothes. Which I'm not going to do.\" Ranges Brown does like include the professional French range Make Up For Ever, which she adores for its dense pigment. She loves how Chanel make-up is presented (\"They have the best packaging\") and \"could find some good blushers at Clinique\". But generally, she is less than blown away by the make-up on offer today. \"There are plenty of colours out there, but a lot of them make you look silly. No one wants to look silly. And everyone does neutrals now, but most people's neutrals wash out the colour of your face. Mine don't. It's not about taking away colour, it's about the right colour.\" Despite her relationship with research giants Lauder, Brown is uninterested in new technologies: waterproof mascara has got gentler, but there have been few other advances that interest her. \"It's all marketing buzz. What I do is not about that. I stick to what I know,\" says Brown, who has made-up armies of catwalk models in her time. \"Fashion does affect beauty because clothes and make-up need to tie in - velvety fabrics need stronger textured make-up. But the ladylike thing won't work,\" she declares firmly. \"Women don't want to groom any more. No one's going to set their hair.\" One unmissable development that Brown sees as positive is our obsession with celebrity style. \"I think it's healthy because for years there were only models. Models to me are quirks of nature. There are a lot more people who can't see or who can't hear than who look like supermodels. Yes, you have to be attractive to be a celebrity, but at least they're real women.\" Brown's strength is that she has a grown-up, womanly approach to what she does, unmoved by passing fads. It is an attitude not dissimilar to that of Catherine Zeta Jones, who told InStyle magazine recently that one thing she won't do is kooky \"little barrettes in my hair ... something I've never been, never will be, is hip\". Brown, similarly, knows instinctively that for most women a choice between being hip and being beautiful is not a difficult one to make. Still, she has a healthy attitude to the limitations of the beauty industry. \"There are no miracles. The only way you have good skin is if you're born with it. Sorry, but that's how it is.\" A car outside the Madrid hotel is waiting to take Brown, her husband and their sons to start a short holiday in Barcelona. Having completed a make-up demonstration to a group of European journalists, she is now clearly itching to get off. \"I don't think you should spend too much time on this stuff,\" she says. \"You know when you go to a party and everyone's in the bathroom doing their faces? I don't even look. To me, you do the best you can at home, then you go out and have fun. You look better if it's not so ... important.\"",

Of the three, Nova is the only monthly; the others will be bi-annual. Nova will be on sale next Thursday. </p> <p>If you are a woman of a certain age, you might remember Nova. It first came out in 1965, smack in the middle of the opulent, affluent 60s when women started shagging around in Mary Quant minis, stoned and listening to the Stones. Nova caught the wave of this freewheeling new optimism: its fashion stories (models who actually smiled and jumped around), features (in-depth politics, shocking sex tips, gritty realism) and covers (Mary Bell, Twiggy, George Best) created a magazine so risqu\u00e9 as to be unprecedented in publishing history. The only thing disappointing about Nova was that all this ferocious feminism was presided over by a man. A succession of men, in fact, until Gillian Cooke, who took over as editor in December 1970 and remained at the helm until the magazine folded in October 1975. </p> <p>There will be no man at the helm of new Nova: publishing has moved on and women are now judged the more suitable gender to edit a women's magazine. Deborah Bee - 35, married, model looks, proud mother of four sons - is the editor charged with bringing to a new generation Nova's original spirit. \"The Nova reader is a feisty young woman who's into lipstick as much as politics,\" Bee says. \"She's ageless because it's not about age any more, it's about attitude.\" </p> <p>Publishers and advertisers might love hearing this type of mission statement (superficially, it convinces them that their product will succeed), but it grates on the rest of us. What definition could Bee give that wouldn't grate, though? For what is the essence of modern woman? Having her cake, eating it and then feeling guilty? This would be a more honest definition, perhaps, though not one likely to endear Bee to that particular brand of feminist who refuses to acknowledge that most women are as man-mad and weight-obsessed as they ever were. They just hold down careers at the same time. </p> <p>The new Nova looks like a good read. Bee and her team have given thought-provoking topics to thought- provoking writers (including Guardian women's editor Libby Brooks): 100 successful women are canvassed on various big issues; there's a piece on why women have two brains, plus some solid, fluff-free health advice. </p> <p>All this is wrapped in stylish, edgy fashion coverage. IPC has been savvy enough to get the big guns on board: Nova's fashion director is Venetia Scott, partner of top photographer Juergen Teller, who for the first issue documents Tracey Emin attending an Alexander McQueen show. Big ticks in the cred box all round. There's Chloe Sevigny modelling, Vanessa Paradis musing on life with Johnny Depp and a couture story illustrated by the talented James Jarvis. </p> <p>\"The triangle we had as our working model was the style press, which is incredibly cool, the fashion mags, which deal with the catwalk very well, and newspapers, which have the best writing. Our woman is right in the middle of that triangle and wants something from all of those,\" Bee says. \"We are the magazine that encapsulates those three things.\" </p> <p> What Nova does encapsulate more than any other women's magazine is stylish art direction. The cover, featuring model du jour Ana Claudia in a stripy Marc Jacobs sweater, manages to look retro and modern at the same time. Inside, the magazine looks slick and well-designed. But will many women respond to this? More worryingly for circulation figures, will they be intimidated? The women's mags with the biggest readerships project a \"join our gang\" mentality: too great a degree of aspiration can be a commercially dangerous thing, as Frank and indeed Mirabella found to their cost. Their edginess edged them straight out of the market. </p> <p>\"Nova is much more commercial than it will perhaps look,\" says IPC's publishing director, Rita Lewis. \"It's the kind of mag you need to sit with and read. It's not a mag that screams for your attention with salacious coverlines. But once you read it, it's terribly engaging, very funny, very now.\" </p> <p>When asked who Nova would be if she were a real woman, Lewis is more cautious. \"In some respects, Jade Jagger. In terms of her heritage, her qualities. Kate Moss, too, but she's an overused person.\" </p> <p>Lewis is supremely confident that there are enough Nova readers out there to make the magazine a success. \"Young women who understand the internet, are completely aware of globalisation and are absolutely in love with labels,\" she says. \"You just have to go out on the street and you see them everywhere.\" </p> <p>Nobody is doubting that this confident, intelligent global-babe exists, but in sufficient numbers to make three new women's fashion titles a success? Vogue, Elle and Marie Claire all have incredibly loyal followings, but perhaps this is missing the point. Women might not need or want another fashion mag, but publishers do. The British economy is booming: demand for luxury labels is high and that means design houses have more money to spend on advertising. And while publishers would all adore healthy circulation figures of 200,000-plus, a tidy sum can still be made through advertising revenue alone. Create a buzz about a magazine and those glossy fashion ads will come rolling in. Get the right stylists and photographers on your masthead - ideally the same ones who work on the big ad campaigns and fashion shows - and it's a fait accompli. In the world of the fash mag, an editor is only as powerful as her team of stylists and photographers. </p> <p>\"Fashion advertising in women's glossy magazines has doubled in the past five years. It's a massive market. Publishers would be remiss not to address it,\" Lewis says. Is she worried about the competition? \"No. There is always competition. It's time for a new brand, time for more than one new brand. Obviously we're going to see who's going to win. But with the credentials of the team we've got on Nova, it's going to work.\"</p>",

And while publishers would all adore healthy circulation figures of 200,000-plus, a tidy sum can still be made through advertising revenue alone. Create a buzz about a magazine and those glossy fashion ads will come rolling in. Get the right stylists and photographers on your masthead - ideally the same ones who work on the big ad campaigns and fashion shows - and it's a fait accompli. In the world of the fash mag, an editor is only as powerful as her team of stylists and photographers. \"Fashion advertising in women's glossy magazines has doubled in the past five years. It's a massive market. Publishers would be remiss not to address it,\" Lewis says. Is she worried about the competition? \"No. There is always competition. It's time for a new brand, time for more than one new brand. Obviously we're going to see who's going to win. But with the credentials of the team we've got on Nova, it's going to work.\"",

Since 1986 \u00a390m has already been spent on research into the issue.</p> <p>As few as one in eight sheep farmers might be obeying the law by reporting suspect cases of scrapie, government vets warned earlier this month, and ministers have announced plans to tag or tattoo 40m sheep in an effort to improve the tracking-down of diseases and the recording of animals' provenance.</p> <p>Much of the work will involve sheep purchased from New Zealand farms, where there is no scrapie, to act as controls for the experiments. There is no evidence that scrapie is a danger to humans, and BSE has only been transmitted from infected cattle to sheep via the laboratory.</p> <p>One theory on the cause of BSE is that the remains of scrapie-infected sheep were eaten in the meat and bone meal which used to be commonly fed to cattle and sheep, and the infective agent then began working in a totally different way in cows.

      "bodyText": "The government is to increase significantly research into whether sheep are harbouring \"hidden\" BSE and posing a new food risk to humans. A programme was announced yesterday to find new tests for live animals, comparisons of sheep BSE with cattle BSE, and ways of determining whether scrapie, a similar disease long endemic in British flocks, is helping to mask a potentially more devastating threat to people's health. It follows concern among scientific advisers that there are still gaps in knowledge about how BSE and similar conditions may be affecting livestock. Researchers around the world are being invited to compete for a share of an extra \u00a35m worth of work next year. Since 1986 \u00a390m has already been spent on research into the issue. As few as one in eight sheep farmers might be obeying the law by reporting suspect cases of scrapie, government vets warned earlier this month, and ministers have announced plans to tag or tattoo 40m sheep in an effort to improve the tracking-down of diseases and the recording of animals' provenance. Much of the work will involve sheep purchased from New Zealand farms, where there is no scrapie, to act as controls for the experiments. There is no evidence that scrapie is a danger to humans, and BSE has only been transmitted from infected cattle to sheep via the laboratory. One theory on the cause of BSE is that the remains of scrapie-infected sheep were eaten in the meat and bone meal which used to be commonly fed to cattle and sheep, and the infective agent then began working in a totally different way in cows. Even if that is not the case, it is possible that BSE was spread from the remains of infected cattle to sheep before the 1988 ban on the use of such feed. Although all sheep fed contaminated materials would probably now have died naturally, scientists see no reason why BSE , if it exists in sheep, should not have become endemic like scrapie. Animals may simply have become carriers of the disease without displaying outward signs. In the laboratory, sheep BSE already appears to behave differently from BSE in cattle. There is no test for identifying scrapie in live sheep, BSE in live cattle, or, until it is clinically apparent, variant CJD (the human form of BSE) in people while still alive. There are promising signs for a scrapie test using blood that is being developed by the US department of agriculture. The government believes successive measures introduced to protect humans by banning parts of cattle and sheep from food are sufficient at present, but needs to know more about how both BSE and scrapie work and their minimum infective \"doses\". Baroness Hayman, the agriculture minister, said: \"Although our scientific knowledge in this field has increased and evolved significantly, there are still identifiable areas where more work needs to be done.\"",

But it now understood to have said it will look at the Phoenix bid provided it gets more detail about the financing.</p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry said Alchemy's decision to pull out of the deal \"provides a new opportunity for proposals to come forward which offer a viable future for Longbridge and which may provide more jobs than under the Alchemy proposals.\"</p> <p>\"Our efforts over the next few weeks will be directed towards achieving a successful outcome which will serve the interests of the workers at Longbridge and the wider community in the West Midlands.\"</p> <p>The announcement will allow Alchemy an extra month in the negotiations, which will also give the Towers team more time to finalise its own bid. </p> <p>BMW had previously said it wanted to complete the sale of Rover by the end of April/early May, but today's unexpected breakdown of talks with Alchemy has led to a re-think of the deadline. </p> <p>The negotiations collapsed dramatically today after Alchemy and Rover's German owner BMW failed to agree on \"contractual matters\".</p> <p>In a terse statement, Alchemy and BMW said they had \"ceased negotiations as they were unable to agree upon certain contractual matters, some of which arose yesterday\". </p> <p>The only previous hint that something was amiss in the negotiations between Alchemy Partners and BMW was the German company's concern about Alchemy's ability to fulfil Rover's pension obligations.</p> <p>Investors have long been unhappy with BMW's 1994 purchase of Rover, and shares in the German company plunged immediately after today's announcement. BMW bought Rover in 1994, attracted by its Land Rover division of four-wheel-drive cars. It thought other Rover brands would fit into the bottom of its range. </p> <p>BMW has pumped nearly \u00a33bn into the Rover group in the last five years but losses continued to increase. Productivity at the Longbridge plant near Birmingham lagged far behind rival manufacturers. A survey in 1998 showed that the plant produced 33 cars per worker, compared with 98 per worker at the Nissan factory in Sunderland.</p> <p>The decision to sell Rover caused a furore, with trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers initially accused of concealing knowledge of BMW's decision to sell Rover. He was later cleared by a committee of MPs, but the Rover crisis has led to questions about the government's economic policy, particularly the high pound, which has hurt manufacturing exports. The sale could mean the loss of 16,000 jobs and possibly another 40,000 in ancillary industries. </p>",

But though there was relief in some quarters that the collapse of the Alchemy deal would open the way for BMW to consider other offers - including the one table by the Phoenix Consortium, headed by former Rover boss John Towers. BMW had earlier brushed off the Phoenix approach saying it wanted more detail about the financial backing. But it now understood to have said it will look at the Phoenix bid provided it gets more detail about the financing. The Department of Trade and Industry said Alchemy's decision to pull out of the deal \"provides a new opportunity for proposals to come forward which offer a viable future for Longbridge and which may provide more jobs than under the Alchemy proposals.\" \"Our efforts over the next few weeks will be directed towards achieving a successful outcome which will serve the interests of the workers at Longbridge and the wider community in the West Midlands.\" The announcement will allow Alchemy an extra month in the negotiations, which will also give the Towers team more time to finalise its own bid. BMW had previously said it wanted to complete the sale of Rover by the end of April/early May, but today's unexpected breakdown of talks with Alchemy has led to a re-think of the deadline. The negotiations collapsed dramatically today after Alchemy and Rover's German owner BMW failed to agree on \"contractual matters\". In a terse statement, Alchemy and BMW said they had \"ceased negotiations as they were unable to agree upon certain contractual matters, some of which arose yesterday\". The only previous hint that something was amiss in the negotiations between Alchemy Partners and BMW was the German company's concern about Alchemy's ability to fulfil Rover's pension obligations. Investors have long been unhappy with BMW's 1994 purchase of Rover, and shares in the German company plunged immediately after today's announcement. BMW bought Rover in 1994, attracted by its Land Rover division of four-wheel-drive cars. It thought other Rover brands would fit into the bottom of its range. BMW has pumped nearly \u00a33bn into the Rover group in the last five years but losses continued to increase. Productivity at the Longbridge plant near Birmingham lagged far behind rival manufacturers. A survey in 1998 showed that the plant produced 33 cars per worker, compared with 98 per worker at the Nissan factory in Sunderland. The decision to sell Rover caused a furore, with trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers initially accused of concealing knowledge of BMW's decision to sell Rover. He was later cleared by a committee of MPs, but the Rover crisis has led to questions about the government's economic policy, particularly the high pound, which has hurt manufacturing exports. The sale could mean the loss of 16,000 jobs and possibly another 40,000 in ancillary industries.",

Throughout a forceful three-hour flow, Sunshine offers nothing less than the complete and unabridged history of 20th century Hungary as seen through the eyes of a middle-class Jewish family (embodied by Ralph Fiennes in a trio of roles). </p> <p>Szabo initially conceived of the project in terms of a mammoth mini-series for German TV before re-ordering and re-writing it for the cinema. The first draft of his script ran to a whopping 500 pages, before the film-maker (in tandem with American playwright Israel Horovitz) hacked three-fifths of the action in order to whittle it down to a more manageable length. </p> <p>\"It was not easy,\" remembers Szabo with a very European shrug. \"But it is very challenging to tell a story shorter. It's like having an appointment with a very nice lady. Before meeting her you imagine all that you will say to her, and then upon arriving she tells you she has a limited time because she is meeting her mother. So you have to tell everything you wanted to say in a shorter time-span. You have to prioritise.\"</p> <p>Analogy aside, it's hard to imagine any \"very nice lady\" bailing out early on a date with Szabo. The man may be pushing sixty these days, but he's a smooth, feline presence, a dash of dapper energy on a slate-grey day in London. His voice is whisper-quiet and coloured by a heavy Hungarian accent (he doesn't \"think\", he \"sinks\"). Despite a lofty international reputation (his 1981 picture Mephisto won the Best Foreign Language Oscar), he still lives in his native Budapest. </p> <p>Szabo's pictures can be read as serious, modernist sagas; intimate human stories with a dark political subtext. In Mephisto an actor's rush to fame is implicitly linked with the growth of Nazism. In Colonel Redl, a gay Jewish army officer gatecrashes the aristocratic ranks of a crumbling Hapsburg empire. \"Style has no interest for me,\" he says. \"It's just a visual way to tell a story. I like to tell my stories as simply and clearly as possible and the film medium is just a means to let me do it.\" Ask him about his own influences and he name-checks Kurosawa and Bergman. When I remark that the opening family scenes of Sunshine reminded me of Bergman's Fanny and Alexander, he looks pleased. \"I met with Bergman when he was filming Fanny and Alexander and we ate lunch around the big family table that he was using in the film. I told Bergman that it reminded me so much of my own childhood, of sitting with my own family at the table of my grandmother.\"</p> <p>This being the case, you might see Sunshine as Szabo's most autobiographical feature to date; examining his own heritage as a Hungarian Jew whose family suffered in the Nazi Holocaust. But the director is wary of discussing this. Sunshine, he says, is merely a compilation of several true stories he heard around his grandmother's table.</p> <p>He prefers to regard the film in a wider context; as a story of the changes that have taken place within Europe. \"I think that everything that's happened in the last 150 years started in Middle Europe. If you just think of Sarajevo: the first world war broke out in Sarajevo and then look at what is happening there now.\" He takes a sip of water. \"Middle Europe is the meeting point of several different languages, mentalities and cultures. Hungary itself is at the edge of two worlds, the culture of the East, represented by Slavic and Muslim cultures, and of the West, which is Protestant and Roman Catholic. So it is an enormous energy.\" For good and bad? Szabo shrugs again. \"Ah,\" he says. \"What is good and what is bad? On every side there are good and bad things.\"</p> <p>The real issue, he argues, is the notion of individual roots and identity within such a climate. This is the issue that Sunshine sets out to tackle, and this, he says, is the key question of contemporary society. \"It is a problem for everyone, for every country. I mean, half of Turkey is now living in Germany, and half of Algeria in France. In every American city, you will find a Chinatown or a Little Italy. So how does a Turkish person become a good German - what does that mean? And what is the identity of an African writer writing in France, or a Chinese writer who writes in the United States? The problem is to find a new identity without losing the old. What is this new identity offered by the 20th or 21st century? Do you keep yourself or lose yourself or become something new? How important is it to hold onto your roots?\"</p> <p>You suspect that, as far as Szabo is concerned, the last question is purely rhetorical. He has no plans to leave Budapest, or abandon his Hungarian heritage. Before filming Sunshine he filmed a documentary on the city. As soon as the round of publicity is finished, he plans to return home and stage an opera. \"Projects like that are important to me, \" he says. \"On the one hand, they feed through and inform by film-making work, give me ideas that I can use later. But they also re-connect me with where I come from. They teach me more about my country.\"</p>",

The Conservatives won 44% of the older vote and Labour just 34%, a swing - or perhaps more of a shuffle - to the right since the 1992 election of 1.5%. The racism charge seems to have come about because Mr Soley's postbag was swollen with letters asking why so much money was being lavished on groups such as asylum seekers when there was not enough available to pay a viable pension. But cooler heads see no reason here for writing the elderly off as an electoral force. For a start, they are now many in number: a sixth of the electorate now is past 65, and that proportion is set to grow. Then - thanks to the same conservatism of which Soley complains - older people cling to the notion that everyone has a duty to vote. All opinion polls show pensioners are far more likely to make it to the polling station than the much sought-after young. One might also make this calculation: the young electorate is a \"shop-around\" vote, with no fixed allegiance, which makes it likely to swing in big numbers between election.

As for the racism: conclusions drawn from an MP's postbag are usually worthless, since those who bother to write are not representative. The ICM evidence shows that while younger voters are more likely to detect racism in politicians' responses to the asylum issue, elderly voters are no less ready to do so than the 35-64 group. You could not convict on such evidence. Any decent judge who tried such proceedings would be able to tell the accused that they left the court without a stain on their pension books.",

Since then the two research centres have been collecting tonsil and appendix samples removed between the mid-1980s and late 1990s. \"The critical gap in our knowledge remains not having a reliable diagnostic test to detect the presence of the abnormal prion protein at the pre-clinical stage of the disease.\" said Professor Donaldson. \"The government is committed to spending some \u00a326 million over the next year into research into CJD and BSE issues to address these important outstanding issues.\" Commenting on today's results, a spokeswoman for the CJD Support Network said: \"Obviously this is very welcome news as it may indicate that there are not going to be huge numbers of people with the disease.

      "trailText": "<p>The fourth River Cafe Cookbook is out next week - and it's tipped to be yet another bestseller.  Claire Phipps on the allure of the restaurant recipe book</p>",
      "byline": "Claire Phipps",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It began about five years ago with the publication of a book of Italian recipes. On the face of it, there was nothing to it. The design was simple: bold colours, full-page colour pictures of no-frills rustic dishes. The recipes were, on the whole, simple; reassuringly short, pithily directed. The ingredients were, if not supermarket staples, at least reasonably easy to track down thanks to the book's list of suppliers of rocket, chicory and prosciutto. The book was the River Cafe Cookbook and it, and its sequels, have sold more than 500,000 copies. </p> <p>Now, with the publication next week of the latest in the River Cafe franchise, River Cafe Green, our interest in all things Italian is set to be stoked again. Focusing on seasonality, with a typical River Cafe emphasis on vegetables, it should ensure that devotees of risotto con fiori di zucchini will be slicing their courgettes when they ought to. Once again, it is packed with illustrations - every featured vegetable is treated to a double-page picture - and big on new ingredients (expect to see sorrel, wild greens and even nettles on grocery lists in the next few months). In fact, it's big in every way, rolling in at a weighty 462 pages. </p> <p>So how did the River Cafe cookbooks - Green will be the fourth - come to be a staple of British kitchen shelves? The restaurant itself opened in London W6 in 1987, eight years before the book was written. It was the book, though, which propelled it into the realms of the elite, and though a world away from Islington (by Tube, at any rate), it was to become one of the shining lights of the New Labour sun-dried tomato revolution. But it wasn't all about drooling press coverage and a mid-90s penchant for penne and Parma ham. </p> <p>\"What the River Cafe is very good at is inspiring,\" says food writer Nigella Lawson. \"They use wonderful pictures and even though I don't really follow the recipes closely, I will look to see how they use a particular vegetable, for example.\" </p> <p>Flora Woods, book buyer for Notting Hill shop Books for Cooks, says it revolutionised cookery book design. \"The first River Cafe cookbook virtually obliterated everything else that was out there. It was effectively the marker for all the books that followed. The publishers began to think of the cookbook as a big new market. And they were right.\" </p> <p>The restaurant cookbook is a rather different animal to the celebrity chef title. Jamie Oliver has just made his return on television as the Naked Chef, but is presently without a restaurant.

      "bodyText": "It began about five years ago with the publication of a book of Italian recipes. On the face of it, there was nothing to it. The design was simple: bold colours, full-page colour pictures of no-frills rustic dishes. The recipes were, on the whole, simple; reassuringly short, pithily directed. The ingredients were, if not supermarket staples, at least reasonably easy to track down thanks to the book's list of suppliers of rocket, chicory and prosciutto. The book was the River Cafe Cookbook and it, and its sequels, have sold more than 500,000 copies. Now, with the publication next week of the latest in the River Cafe franchise, River Cafe Green, our interest in all things Italian is set to be stoked again. Focusing on seasonality, with a typical River Cafe emphasis on vegetables, it should ensure that devotees of risotto con fiori di zucchini will be slicing their courgettes when they ought to. Once again, it is packed with illustrations - every featured vegetable is treated to a double-page picture - and big on new ingredients (expect to see sorrel, wild greens and even nettles on grocery lists in the next few months). In fact, it's big in every way, rolling in at a weighty 462 pages. So how did the River Cafe cookbooks - Green will be the fourth - come to be a staple of British kitchen shelves? The restaurant itself opened in London W6 in 1987, eight years before the book was written. It was the book, though, which propelled it into the realms of the elite, and though a world away from Islington (by Tube, at any rate), it was to become one of the shining lights of the New Labour sun-dried tomato revolution. But it wasn't all about drooling press coverage and a mid-90s penchant for penne and Parma ham. \"What the River Cafe is very good at is inspiring,\" says food writer Nigella Lawson. \"They use wonderful pictures and even though I don't really follow the recipes closely, I will look to see how they use a particular vegetable, for example.\" Flora Woods, book buyer for Notting Hill shop Books for Cooks, says it revolutionised cookery book design. \"The first River Cafe cookbook virtually obliterated everything else that was out there. It was effectively the marker for all the books that followed. The publishers began to think of the cookbook as a big new market. And they were right.\" The restaurant cookbook is a rather different animal to the celebrity chef title. Jamie Oliver has just made his return on television as the Naked Chef, but is presently without a restaurant. He and his producers have deliberately given his cooking escapades a very personal flavour - buy the book, taste the trendy Vespa-riding lifestyle. Similarly, Delia Smith has made her name through books that never stray far from the kitchen store cupboard. And both have reached massive audiences - many more than a restaurant could in a year's worth of dinner sittings - through their television shows. So it's easy to see why the armchair chef buys a book for a recipe that has just been expertly, and provocatively, whipped up on screen.

The strike, involving mainly Latino workers, has been likened to the victories achieved nearly 30 years ago by Latino farm workers.</p> <p>The 8,500 cleaners, known as janitors in the US, went on strike earlier this month in pursuit of an increase in pay of $1 (63p) an hour for each of the next three years. They have settled for an immediate bonus of $500 plus an increase of 25% over the next three years. It is the largest such settlement for 20 years and is seen as a sign of the clout of the Services Employees International Union (SEIU) which represents them and has been increasingly active in recruiting low-paid Latino workers.</p> <p>The strikers took to the streets of LA three weeks ago and brought traffic to a stand still in the city centre with their marches and demonstrations. They won vast public support for their claims that they deserved to be paid better for cleaning the toilets and offices of some of the richest businesses in the country.</p> <p>The Roman Catholic archbishop Roger Mahony offered his support and took part in some of the final negotiations. He had earlier described the strikers' cause as one of \"fundamental economic justice\". Local councillor Jackie Goldberg was arrested with the janitors on one of their demonstrations in Bel-Air. Most of the local media gave sympathetic coverage to the strikers.</p> <p>Mike Garcia, president of the SEIU Local 187, the local union branch, said: \"This is the beginning of a new era for organised labour. This fight wasn't just about us. That's why we got such tremendous community and political support. We were at the right place at the right time. People were looking for an underdog to root for.\"</p> <p>Attention now shifts northwards where 5,500 janitors in the Bay Area of San Francisco are in dispute. A march by janitors and supporters through silicon valley aimed at highlighting the disparity between rich and poor was due to take place yesterday.</p> <p>The LA strike is significant in that it involves a part of the workforce that employers traditionally believed could be taken on and defeated because there is a large pool of unofficial labour in California, some of whom are prepared to work for very low wages. People have been reluctant to strike in the past for fear that they could easily be replaced with people desperate for work.</p> <p>Unions representing more than 300,000 workers in Los Angeles, including teachers and public transport workers, are due to enter negotiations shortly and the victory is seen as a sign that the unions are finally taking the initiative after decades of relative passivity.</p> <p>The strike comes as the British film director Ken Loach is completing a film featuring a previous janitors' strike which also campaigned under the slogan of \" Si, se puede \" (yes, it is possible).</p>",

      "bodyText": "The workers who clean the offices of corporate Los Angeles returned to work yesterday following a three-week strike that is being hailed as a major victory for the low-paid and a sign of growing union militancy in the United States. The strike, involving mainly Latino workers, has been likened to the victories achieved nearly 30 years ago by Latino farm workers. The 8,500 cleaners, known as janitors in the US, went on strike earlier this month in pursuit of an increase in pay of $1 (63p) an hour for each of the next three years. They have settled for an immediate bonus of $500 plus an increase of 25% over the next three years. It is the largest such settlement for 20 years and is seen as a sign of the clout of the Services Employees International Union (SEIU) which represents them and has been increasingly active in recruiting low-paid Latino workers. The strikers took to the streets of LA three weeks ago and brought traffic to a stand still in the city centre with their marches and demonstrations. They won vast public support for their claims that they deserved to be paid better for cleaning the toilets and offices of some of the richest businesses in the country. The Roman Catholic archbishop Roger Mahony offered his support and took part in some of the final negotiations. He had earlier described the strikers' cause as one of \"fundamental economic justice\". Local councillor Jackie Goldberg was arrested with the janitors on one of their demonstrations in Bel-Air. Most of the local media gave sympathetic coverage to the strikers. Mike Garcia, president of the SEIU Local 187, the local union branch, said: \"This is the beginning of a new era for organised labour. This fight wasn't just about us. That's why we got such tremendous community and political support. We were at the right place at the right time. People were looking for an underdog to root for.\" Attention now shifts northwards where 5,500 janitors in the Bay Area of San Francisco are in dispute. A march by janitors and supporters through silicon valley aimed at highlighting the disparity between rich and poor was due to take place yesterday. The LA strike is significant in that it involves a part of the workforce that employers traditionally believed could be taken on and defeated because there is a large pool of unofficial labour in California, some of whom are prepared to work for very low wages. People have been reluctant to strike in the past for fear that they could easily be replaced with people desperate for work. Unions representing more than 300,000 workers in Los Angeles, including teachers and public transport workers, are due to enter negotiations shortly and the victory is seen as a sign that the unions are finally taking the initiative after decades of relative passivity. The strike comes as the British film director Ken Loach is completing a film featuring a previous janitors' strike which also campaigned under the slogan of \" Si, se puede \" (yes, it is possible).",

      "bodyText": "For the second time in four months, scientists have warned of earthquakes in or near Istanbul. Millions could be at risk from a powerful earthquake in Turkey within the next 30 years, according to a study published today in the US journal Science. The geologists involved in the study claim not to be making predictions, they are simply weighing the probabilities after studying the pattern of earth tremors that killed 18,000 last year in two separate shocks along the Anatolian fault that runs under Istanbul. \"An earthquake could happen near Istanbul tomorrow, or in many years,\" said Tom Parsons, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey, who worked with Turkish and Japanese colleagues on the report. \"But in all likelihood we have time to re-engineer many buildings to better protect the people who live and work there. We hope that our research will prove useful to Turkish leaders and scientists as they evaluate various options.\" An earthquake measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale hit the city of Izmit in August and a 7.1- magnitude event shook Duzce in November; after each event there were immediate and bitter recriminations about unenforced building codes, bribed officials and sub-standard housing. Istanbul has been severely damaged at least a dozen times in the last 1,500 years. The guess is that the release of stress along one section of the fault may increase the strain further along, raising the hazard of earthquakes in the relatively near future. The report is a warning to city authorities of worse to come; the risk of a major earthquake is put at 50-50 in the next 22 years, or 32% in the next decade. Bill McGuire, of the London-based Benfield Greig hazards research centre, said: \"We have known since the Izmit quake that if the pattern of earthquakes followed the same pattern it did in the 18th century, then we can expect Istanbul to be hit within the next couple of decades\u0085 I can't see anything other than a catastrophe happening, to be honest.\"",

And they were even more impressed when Kim Philby told them there were fewer than 10 British agents operating in the Soviet section of head office.

      "bodyText": "Police investigating claims of physical and sexual abuse in a Devon children's home have extended their inquiries to three more institutions in the belief that they might be dealing with abuse on a scale to rival that of the north Wales scandal. Detectives have questioned former pupils at three privately run residential special needs schools in the south of the county, where staff at a children's home in which at least 80 children were allegedly abused, used to work. Last night, Devon and Cornwall police played down reports that up to 4,000 children might have been abused between the mid-50s and the mid-80s. \"We don't know where that figure came from,\" said Detective Chief Inspector Tony Carney, who refused to divulge the number of former pupils who had been contacted. But a police spokeswoman admitted there might be as many alleged victims as in the north Wales scandal, in which 650 children were allegedly abused at care homes over 16 years. \"We could be looking at something at least that big,\" she said. \"It's such an in-depth investigation that at the moment we just don't know the scale of it.\" Operation Lentisk, as the inquiry has been codenamed, was set up in January 1998 after allegations of abuse at a care home in south Devon. Three people are awaiting trial. Seventy-five people are pursuing a civil action against Devon county council, eight other local authorities and the Home Office for alleged negligence. Questionnaires have been sent to former pupils at the three private schools - Pitt House, in Torquay; Stokelake, in Chudleigh; and Ingsdon House school, in Bickington - asking them about abuse.",

Claims that emissions from mobile phones in effect heat the brain, causing illnesses ranging from memory loss to tumours, appear to be unfounded, the 10-month Stewart inquiry has concluded. Evidence in the report, due to be published on May 11, suggests that mobiles heat the brain by only one tenth of a degree while the body's temperature normally varies by one degree thoughout the day. The report will call, however, for tighter controls on emissions to match the norm in Europe. It will also urge the Department of Health and business to fund more research, especially into the non-thermal effects of phones. The mobile phone companies, fearful of a commercially damaging report, have been kept abreast of its direction as they prepared their bids, halted at \u00a322bn yesterday, for the new generation of licences. Critics of the report will claim that the committee of physicists and neurologists - headed by Professor William Stewart of Tayside University hospital - has been \"captured\" by the national radiological protection board which has acted as the secretariat to the committee. Members of the NRPB gave evidence to the committee strongly suggesting mobiles were safe. Prof Stewart and his colleagues are said to have been struck by the vehemence of the opposition to the siting of mobile masts and the public's sense of powerlessness in their erection. They are set to recommend changes to make it easier to block masts - especially when they are sited near schools. There are more than 20,000 masts in Britain and their number is expected to grow rapidly. Orange alone is planning to increase its sites from 6,500 to 10,000 by the end of next year. Minutes of the group's meeting with the public show it \"recognised there was a need to empower the public, particlarly in the area of planning\". It is expected to recommend a system of full planning control on new masts and give councils a right to take public fear of health risks into account. A full national register of masts is also likely to be proposed. The measures follow similar recommendations from the Scottish Parliament's environment select committee.

If they are successful, the hearing would pave the way for a prosecution on human rights charges. A day earlier proceedings had begun amid clashes in the streets between supporters and opponents of the ailing 84-year-old general. The hearing has become a test for the Chilean government's assertion that Gen Pinochet can be tried in his own country. In the first session the Santiago court of appeals heard allegations accusing the former dictator of being the \"intellectual author\" of 19 assassinations. This is the first time that Gen Pinochet has been challenged by Chilean courts, which refused attempts by his lawyers to stop the proceedings immediately on grounds of mental and physical frailty. The court yesterday began hearing the summary of the charges against him, which are contained in a 3,500-page document. The investigation is being headed by Judge Juan Guzman Tapia, who has interviewed hundreds of people in an attempt to establish whether Gen Pinochet was responsible for the killings which took place following the 1973 military coup. Yesterday, outside the court, hundreds of anti-Pinochet protesters handed out leaflets with the former dictator's face placed in cross-hair rifle sights. Viviana Diaz, president of the Association of the Detained and Disappeared, which represents the 1,100 victims of the Pinochet regime whose bodies have yet to be found, said: \"Today begins the trial against the person most guilty of the crimes committed in our country.\" Supporters of Gen Pinochet were outnumbered 15-1 but still managed to cause havoc by tossing coins, bottles and stones at lawyers and human rights protesters. The two groups were kept apart by riot police. As a self-designated \"senator for life\" Gen Pinochet placed himself beyond the reach of the law. He is also partially protected by an amnesty law that defined the military repression as part of a civil war. The manoeuvres were unchallenged while Gen Pinochet remained an almost mythical figure in Chile. Following his arrest in Britain in October 1998, however, legal challenges to his immunity were bolstered by public anger at the way the former dictator had terrorised his way into a quiet retirement. The new socialist president, Ricardo Lagos, has refused to give in to military threats since taking office in March. \"The country is tranquil because the institutions [of justice] function... as we have said to the world, in this country everyone, powerful or humble, is subject to the courts,\" Mr Lagos said yesterday in a clear message to the military, who have previously taken to the streets to pressure the civilian government to halt investigations. In two further signs that Gen Pinochet's grasp of power is faltering, a group of imprisoned military officials - who had previously maintained a pact of silence - has begun meetings with journalists to leak documents that implicate the former leader directly in assassinations. On Tuesday, a website (www.elmostrador.cl) published secret military documents that directly link Gen Pinochet to an army hit squad that worked during the mid-80s.",

      "bodyText": "British American Tobacco has hired two law firms in an attempt to avert court action and a government inquiry into evidence that it exploited smuggling. The London-based corporation, the world's second biggest cigarette maker, yesterday disclosed it has taken the steps since internal documents were published detailing how BAT benefited from black marketeering. City firm Allen &amp; Overy has been asked by BAT to investigate its \"current business practice\" and US chain Crevath Swaine and Moore to fight any anti-racketeering charges. The Guardian revealed earlier this year how BAT supplied huge numbers of cigarettes around the world knowing they would end up in the hands of smugglers. BAT fears Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, will use his powers under the companies act to order DTI inspectors to investigate the allegations. The Commons health committee is planning to call for a DTI inquiry when it publishes a report next month expected to be highly critical of BAT. The company's board hopes its actions will dissuade Mr Byers as well as preparing a defence against any possible legal action brought in the US. Martin Broughton, BAT's chairman whose earnings jumped by a third last year to \u00a31.36m, told yesterday's annual general meeting in London: \"There is really no need for a DTI investigation.\" But anti-smoking campaigners complained the Allen &amp; Overy investigation would look only at the company's current operations. The internal documents published earlier this year showed how a series of euphemisms were used for cigarettes sold to wholesalers that ended up on black markets in South and North America and across Asia.

The contents have since probably found their way to a council tip or incinerator.</p> <p>This is a further embarrassment for one of the world's leading auction houses, which has been going through a rocky period with a US Justice Department inquiry over allegations of commission fixing and several senior resignations. </p> <p>A Sotheby's statement which claimed that the painting, a small early oil study of plants, was worth \u00a3100,000 raised eyebrows. Freud, now in his 70s, has become one of the most instantly recognisable and collectable of all living British artists, and many of his most startling prices have been achieved through Sotheby's sales. The record price was \u00a33.5m for a large oil painting of an interior, paid in 1998 by a private collector at a Sotheby's auction in New York. </p> <p>\"I think most people interested in Freud would regard \u00a3100,000 as a bit of a snip,\" David Barrie, director of the independent art charity, the National Art Collections Fund, said. The NACF has helped several British public collections to acquire Freuds, including the Tate, with grants to match the huge prices offered by private buyers. </p> <p>Collectors covet most the pitilessly bleak nude studies and his portraits, such as The Artist's Mother - one of 1,000 images which he made of his mother Lucie in the last decade of her life - sold for \u00a32m last year. </p> <p>However Edward King, director of the Abbot Hall gallery in Kendal, Cumbria, which mounted a major Freud retrospective, said: \"Collectors really want anything he did - even very small early sketches are cherished as rarities.\" </p> <p>The accident happened before Easter, when the painting had been delivered from the owner's home to the auction house store room in central London. It was securely packed in a wooden travelling crate, which was apparently placed in the wrong part of the store and mixed up with the piles of used packaging which are crushed before being taken away as rubbish. </p> <p>Sotheby's denied reports that the porters involved were sacked immediately. \"That is not correct, but this is an internal matter and we are not commenting any further,\" a spokesman said. </p> <p>The picture,which is believed to date from the 1960s and to have been about two feet square, was owned by a private collector, and was to be auctioned at Sotheby's contemporary art sale in June. Experts from Sotheby's had given the picture an initial appraisal at his home, but it would have been studied in more detail and photographed for the catalogue at the auction house premises. </p> <p>The company spokesman blamed \"human error\" and described the incident as \"most unfortunate\". </p> <p>It was no surprise that there was no reaction yesterday from the notably reserved artist himself. His very aloofness swells his status: supermodel Naomi Campbell recently put him top of the list of people she wanted to meet in London \"because he's so cool\", and Jerry Hall posed nude for him while pregnant with her latest child. </p> <p>However Mr King, who came to know him well while working on the Abbot Hall exhibition, said his reaction might be surprising. </p> <p>\"He might be terribly upset, but he might well think it hilarious; he might roar laughing,\" he said. \"He is intensely engaged with his paintings while he is making them, and when they are shown in public he takes a very hands-on part in deciding where and how they should be hung. But once they are sold, he once told me, he feels they have moved out of his life. </p> <p>\"He is not one of those artists who regards everything he has ever painted almost as his children.\" </p> <p>The artist had no direct financial interest in this sale, but could well have benefited if the painting had sold again in the next few years. </p> <p>His lawyer, Diana Rawstrom, of the London firm of Goodman Derrick, studied reports of the incident yesterday.

Mr Giuliani was back in the lead by the summer, however. Mrs Clinton said yesterday: \"Like all New Yorkers, my prayers and best wishes are with Mr Giuliani.\" In classic Giuliani style, the mayor littered his announcement with jokes and said that he would be taking advice from Joe Torre, manager of the New York Yankees baseball team, who suffered prostate cancer last year.

The poll shows the frontrunner, Ken Livingstone, with an apparently unbeatable 34-point lead over Tory Steven Norris. The poll findings, which point to a potential humiliation for the former health secretary, were published as differences emerged between Mr Dobson and Labour assembly candidates over Mr Livingstone's manifesto pledge to cut traffic by 15% in 10 years. Yesterday's ICM poll for the Evening Standard put Mr Livingstone's support at 51% - up a couple of points on a fortnight ago and back where he was in February - with Mr Norris up one at 17%, Mr Dobson down one at 14% and the Liberal Democrat, Susan Kramer, holding steady at 12%. But, more alarmingly for Tony Blair and the Dobson campaign, it shows Mr Dobson level-pegging with Ms Kramer at 12% when the results are restricted to the two-thirds of respondents who said they were certain or likely to vote next Thursday, with Mr Livingstone at 53%. Mr Dobson insisted the findings bore no relation to his canvassing returns and that voters would think twice about Mr Livingstone's \"hidden taxes\". Labour posters claim Mr Livingstone will introduce a monthly congestion charge of \u00a3300 to achieve his traffic reduction target of 15% by 2010. But at least five Labour candidates running in tandem with Mr Dobson for the assembly have signed up to the same target as part of a Friends of the Earth campaign, a spokesman for the environmental group said yesterday. Labour's candidate for Haringey and Enfield, Nicky Gavron, last month signed a statement in support of introducing congestion charges in the capital by 2003, as part of a plan to tackle the traffic crisis backed by the boroughs . Jeremy Fraser, Mr Dobson's campaign manager, said: \"Assembly candidates may have signed up to the 15% cut, but Frank has a large degree of scepticism about what can be achieved and serious candidates shouldn't sign up to stuff they don't think can be achieved\". A Labour spokesman added that no one was opposed to the \"principle of congestion charging or aspirational targets\", but that Mr Livingstone had ruled out increasing car parking charges, as proposed by the boroughs, and would have to rely on congestion charges. That is rejected by Mr Livingstone, whose manifesto promises to consult about a possible charge for \"unnecessary car journeys in a small zone of central London\" to begin around 2002, as part of a wider package of measures. His spokesman dismissed the \u00a3300 figure as preposterous.

A Stena spokeswoman confirmed that 38 people had minor injuries, including at least one member of staff, with one casualty suffering a broken arm. \"The investigation into the incident is continuing and the damage to the boat is still being assessed. \"All other services are continuing as normal.\" The 8.15am sailing from Dover was carrying 1,241 passengers and 123 crew. The 28,838 tonne Aquitaine is P&amp;O's largest ferry on the route and came into service last November. Passenger John Duncombe, 41, a solicitor from Essex, said everyone had been standing ready to get off the ferry as they approached berth seven at Calais. \"The first thing I thought of was the boat sinking. There was a big thump, the lights went off and the engine went quiet. I saw someone fly about 10ft across the corridor. \"After realising my wife was okay I looked around and could see people lying on the floor hurt and screaming.\" Mr Duncombe said he saw around 15 people carried off the boat on stretchers. About a dozen ambulances and a helicopter were parked on the quayside next to the ferry. He said the ship's captain requested over the boat's intercom for any doctors and nurses to come forward. Gerard Barron, head of communications at the Port of Calais, said a number of cars and lorries on board were damaged in the collision. Around 15 people had been taken to hospital in the town. Mr Barron said the ferry got into difficulties as it tried to dock at Calais. \"It seemed that the boat was unable to reverse its propeller to stop and crashed into the quay.\"",

      "bodyText": "Judges are passing illegal sentences and prisoners are unlawfully held in jail because crucial information is not being passed between courts and prisons, the six chief inspectors who oversee the criminal justice system say today. A joint report from the six inspectorates, covering prisons, police, crown prosecution service, probation, social services and magistrates courts, points to widespread communication failings which could lead to a flood of court challenges when the Human Rights Act comes into force next October. The report, the first to survey the whole of the criminal justice system, says there are significant gaps in provision of information between agencies \"which could compromise the achievement of the government's aims for the criminal justice system.\" It says lack of information leads judges to impose illegal sentences on offenders who are released from prison on licence but commit further offences and are sent back to jail. \"Some judges prefer to specify the sentence length in days and, not having the information regarding the previous time spent in prison to hand, they estimate the sentence length. \"In many cases the sentences are illegal because they are too long.\" The inspectors complain that courts are under no obligation to notify prisons when charges are dropped. One prison is being sued by a former inmate because staff wrongly calculated the time he had to serve. They failed to deduct days associated with a charge they were not told had been dropped. \"It was only when the prisoner mentioned that he thought he had been in prison too long - in fact 27 days too long - that his file was looked at more carefully.\" Inspectors were \"concerned\" to find that prisons are not told when defendants brought to court in custody are released by the court on bail. The prison has to rely on the prisoner escort report from the private contractor which takes inmates to court, with a note explaining why the prisoner was released. \"Without written documentation from the court, there is a risk that prisoners might be released in error. \"With no official confirmation of release, there is also a potential for collusion in escapes.\" One busy prison which sent 60 or more inmates to court each day filled in the prisoner escort report form, which specifies whether the inmate is a risk for escape or violence, a few days in advance. The practice contributed to an escape when a prisoner's escape risk assessment changed between completion of the form and departure for court. Confiscation orders - court orders requiring offenders such as drug dealers to pay a sum of money or serve further time in jail - \"sometimes simply disappear into the multitude of paperwork in prison files\". In one case, a drug dealer who had been ordered to pay \u00a3135,000 or serve an extra two years, was let out early even though none of the money was paid. The order was missed by the two prisons where he was an inmate. He had to be rearrested to complete his sentence. The report says: \"Inspectors have the most serious concerns about the multiplicity and incompleteness of court warrants which give the prison service the legal authority to hold prisoners in custody. \"Not only does the prison need to know the legal status of prisoners (in order to accommodate them appropriately) but also further details of the sentence, and time spent in police custody, in order to calculate correctly the period to be served. \"The current system relies on prison staff in custody offices being prepared to pursue courts for the information, which is not always willingly given.\" The inspectors criticise magistrates courts for delays in telling police about the outcomes of cases. \"These delays can cause serious problems for the police and victims: offenders may be disqualified from driving with the police being unaware; offenders may be released on conditional bail and police be unaware. \"In consequence, victims of crime may also be unaware that an offender has been released and may be caused alarm or distress by being confronted by their attacker.\"",

      "bodyText": "The US Congress will refuse to ratify any arms agreement that is made between the United States and Russia for the remainder of the Clinton administration's term, senior Republican leaders have made clear. \"This administration's time for grand treaty initiatives is at an end,\" the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Senator Jesse Helms, said in a speech in Washington. Mr Helms said he wanted to play no part in any \"final photo op\" for the administration. His threat, which is seen as a real one, could affect any US-Russian agreement to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic-Missile (ABM) treaty to allow the development of missile defence systems, as well as any agreement on Start 3 arms cuts. The pledge creates a major complication for President Clinton and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, as they prepare for a US-Russian summit in Moscow in early June, at which Washington is hoping to secure Russian agreement to a limited US missile-defence system in return for another round of missile cuts. US negotiators who met the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, in Washington for two days of talks this week believe that Moscow is willing to continue discussing the missile-defence issue and it has not ruled out the possibility of an agreement to amend the ABM treaty. Meanwhile, the Republican presidential candidate, George W Bush, made it clear to the Russian government this week that a Republican administration would not feel bound by a limited agreement on missile defence signed with the Clinton administration. Mr Bush would reserve the right to proceed to a much more extensive missile-defence programme than any that is currently under discussion in Washington. Mr Bush also met Mr Ivanov in Washington on Tuesday at the Russian foreign minister's request. It was the first high-level, face-to-face meeting between the Russian government and Mr Bush, who was accompanied in the talks by his senior foreign policy adviser Condoleezza Rice and his defence adviser Paul Wolfowitz. The Republican presidential hopeful told the Russians that, if Russia would not amend the ABM treaty to allow the US to develop a missile-defence programme, a Bush administration would back out of the treaty. \"It's time to move to a new world, and the ABM treaty is a product of a different world,\" Ms Rice said in a speech in Washington yesterday. The Republicans' readiness to turn the screw on the missile-defence issue at this time reflects their fear that Mr Clinton aims to make a more limited agreement with the Putin government over the issue in June. At present, subject to the success of a still incomplete test programme, the US intends to establish what it describes as a \"limited\" national missile-defence system, which would have around a hundred interceptor missiles based in Alaska to destroy a small number of incoming warheads fired at the US by \"rogue states\" such as North Korea, Iraq or Iran. Mr Clinton has said he will make a final decision on whether to deploy the system later this year, following the completion of the test programme. A third test firing is due to take place in June, and governments around the world are assuming that the only uncertainty is when, rather than whether, Washington will decide to deploy the system. Mr Helms and other Republican hawks want the missile-defence system to be much larger. They favour including space-based interceptors in the programme as well as sea- or land-based anti-missile missiles designed to intercept hostile missiles during the \"booster\" stage of their launch, in order that the fall-out debris would fall over the missile's country of origin. Many Republicans also wish to be able to extend the missile-defence shield to some of the US's allies, especially to Taiwan.",

Net government debt amounts to about \u00a3340bn, generating interest payments of \u00a327.8bn in 2000/2001.

ANZ is expected to use its proceeds from the sale, which includes \u00a3475m of goodwill, to buy back its shares in what it believes will be one of the largest ever single transactions of its kind in Australia.",

      "body": "<p>Unhappy Britons have been able to buy cheaper pick-me-up pills since January, when the popular antidepressant Prozac lost its UK patent protection. </p> <p>A glut of companies leapt into the market with cut-price versions of the drug. Leading the way was Hertfordshire-based Bioglan Pharma, which got its version of Prozac into pharmacies within 24 hours of the liberalisation. </p> <p>That produced a pleasing blip in Bioglan's annual sales, even though the company's financial year ended just two weeks later. However, the company came in for some flak in the City yesterday, when its full results were made public. </p> <p>As well as selling generic drugs, Bioglan specialises in developing dermatology treatments - for problems such as acne, psoriasis and eczema. The company's pre-tax profits doubled to \u00a37m but this included licensing income of \u00a39m from a US group, Winston Laboratories. This was under the terms of a deal in December, when Bioglan raised \u00a324m from shareholders to buy 19% of Winston. </p> <p>It emerged yesterday that without the Winston transaction, Bioglan would have made a loss because of a largely unexplained slump in European sales of its skin drugs during the second half of the year. </p> <p>John Savin, an analyst at Greig Middleton, said: \"My suspicion is that they were having a major slowdown and the Winston deal was an opportunity to rescue profits.\" </p> <p>Bioglan's shares, which have been riding high for most of the year, slumped 71p to 587p on the news. Chief executive Terry Sadler has responded to recent events by stepping up research and development spending - he has increased this year's budget from \u00a36.7m to \u00a310.6m. This means profits will suffer in the short-term but it should pay off with new products further ahead. </p> <p>Bioglan is working on drug discovery technology - its expertise is in taking medicines which are difficult to dissolve and altering their chemical make-up to get them into creams. Using this technique, the group has been able to make easy-to-apply versions of many widely used skin treatments. </p> <p>In the past, Bioglan has been a notable success story. Mr Sadler bought the business in 1984 for \u00a3176,000, raising part of the money by borrowing \u00a330,000 on three gold credit cards. The group's market value is now \u00a3550m and Mr Sadler's 40% stake is worth nearly \u00a3200m. </p> <p>Bioglan's house broker, HSBC Securities, believe profits will recover to \u00a39m this year. But just a couple of months ago, Bioglan's shares were changing hands for more than 900p. It will take more than a few pills to push the price that high again.</p>",

A glut of companies leapt into the market with cut-price versions of the drug. Leading the way was Hertfordshire-based Bioglan Pharma, which got its version of Prozac into pharmacies within 24 hours of the liberalisation. That produced a pleasing blip in Bioglan's annual sales, even though the company's financial year ended just two weeks later. However, the company came in for some flak in the City yesterday, when its full results were made public. As well as selling generic drugs, Bioglan specialises in developing dermatology treatments - for problems such as acne, psoriasis and eczema. The company's pre-tax profits doubled to \u00a37m but this included licensing income of \u00a39m from a US group, Winston Laboratories. This was under the terms of a deal in December, when Bioglan raised \u00a324m from shareholders to buy 19% of Winston. It emerged yesterday that without the Winston transaction, Bioglan would have made a loss because of a largely unexplained slump in European sales of its skin drugs during the second half of the year. John Savin, an analyst at Greig Middleton, said: \"My suspicion is that they were having a major slowdown and the Winston deal was an opportunity to rescue profits.\" Bioglan's shares, which have been riding high for most of the year, slumped 71p to 587p on the news. Chief executive Terry Sadler has responded to recent events by stepping up research and development spending - he has increased this year's budget from \u00a36.7m to \u00a310.6m. This means profits will suffer in the short-term but it should pay off with new products further ahead. Bioglan is working on drug discovery technology - its expertise is in taking medicines which are difficult to dissolve and altering their chemical make-up to get them into creams. Using this technique, the group has been able to make easy-to-apply versions of many widely used skin treatments. In the past, Bioglan has been a notable success story. Mr Sadler bought the business in 1984 for \u00a3176,000, raising part of the money by borrowing \u00a330,000 on three gold credit cards. The group's market value is now \u00a3550m and Mr Sadler's 40% stake is worth nearly \u00a3200m. Bioglan's house broker, HSBC Securities, believe profits will recover to \u00a39m this year. But just a couple of months ago, Bioglan's shares were changing hands for more than 900p. It will take more than a few pills to push the price that high again.",

They bathed them in a growth factor and then infected the cells with a retrovirus which carried a good copy of the gene. They then put the infected cells back into the babies without giving any drug treatment at all. The children now have immune cell counts similar to those of normal children. Both now live at home, without treatment, and are developing normally.",

      "bodyText": "William Hague was yesterday accused of softening Tory policy on crime when he indicated that he favoured abolishing the mandatory life sentence for murder. In a fresh twist to Conservative attempts to capitalise on public concern over the Tony Martin case, the Tory leader said his party's manifesto would include a guarantee to drop opposition to any weakening of the principle that murder automatically attracts a life sentence, as part of a package to \"rebalance\" the law in favour of householders acting in self-defence. The change would mean not only a u-turn for Mr Hague (who, as the Guardian revealed yesterday, voted against such a change in the law in 1991) but a reversal in long-established party policy. A blanket change, which would leave Labour tougher on the issue than the Tories, would be certain to be opposed by Conservative law and order hardliners. Mr Hague's acknowledgement on Radio 4's Today programme that, if asked to vote on mandatory life sentences today, he would change his 1991 stance, was immediately seized on by the home secretary, Jack Straw. In a letter to the Conservative leader and the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, he wrote: \"If this policy has any effect, it can only mean that murderers would receive shorter sentences. The public would be less protected.\" Mr Hague's words were yesterday being played down rapidly by Central Office sources, who claimed the party's preferred option was to see defendants such as Martin, who shot a burglar in his home, charged with manslaughter rather than murder, allowing a more lenient sentence. A spokesman said: \"William made it clear he was talking about the options in the context of the review of the laws on self-defence which we are proposing. \"One option would be to say that a life sentence for murder would not be mandatory under very limited circumstances where the householder has mounted a plea of self-defence. But a better way of doing this might well be... that the charge in those circumstances would be manslaughter rather than murder.\" The call for more flexibility in murder sentencing puts Mr Hague to the left of Mr Straw, who makes clear the government had \"no plans\" to change the law. Despite Central Office backtracking, the move would win for Mr Hague the support of lawyers and the judiciary, which has long clamoured for more discretion and flexibility in sentencing. It would allow judges to pass relatively short sentences on mercy killers, battered women who kill their violent spouses after years of abuse, and people who use excessive force in self-defence, while reserving life sentences for cases such as that of Myra Hindley or Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper. Lord Donaldson, former master of the rolls, said: \"I and most of the judges in the Lords have been advocating this for years. \"But I'd be surprised if the present government was prepared to change it. It seems to be something which is inherent to politicians - they want to control the sentence.\" Release of prisoners serving mandatory life sentences is in the final instance at the discretion of the home secretary. Giving judges the flexibility to fit the punishment to the crime looks like the only one of Mr Hague's ideas for \"rebalancing\" the justice system in self-defence cases that stands up to scrutiny. His suggestion that a subjective test should be introduced, so \"a person might be able to use force if it seemed reasonable to him in the circumstances in which he thought himself to be\", was established in case law in the 1980s.",

      "body": "<p>My daughter, who is 32, has suffered from depression for the past seven years. She received counselling and is now on medication. Though happily married with a lovely home and a responsible job, she has low self-esteem which has brought her to the brink of suicide.</p> <p>Recently, she wrote to me blaming me for her illness, and accusing me of criticising her and favouring her sisters. She says every encounter with me leaves her distressed, and has decided she does not want to see me again. I was devastated by this and wrote back to her, but there has been no response.</p> <p>My husband and I divorced when she was 17, and I am aware of the pain it caused, but we separated amicably. I want my daughter to have the help that will enable her to see her childhood in a more balanced way. Any suggestions?</p> <p><b> Her view is as valid</b><br></p> <p>As the divorced mother of a daughter a few years older than yours, I would be distraught to be told that she never wanted to see me again. However, as one who has suffered from depression, I find myself identifying with your daughter. I also felt undervalued by my mother, and she seemed to favour my siblings. When I went into therapy she said she would never accept that she was to blame for my problems. After struggling for many years, I finally took control of my life through counselling/psychotherapy.</p> <p>Is it possible that your daughter has been enabled to come to terms with the past through counselling? Who is to say that counselling has not given her a balanced view of her childhood? Could not her perspective be at least as valid as yours?</p> <p>Is there someone - friend, relative, minister - with whom you could talk this through? I hope that this, and the love you have for your daughter, will enable you to support her, whatever decisions she makes about her life.</p> <p><b> Show her you love her</b></p> <p>Three years ago, I was in a similar situation to your daughter. At the time, it all made perfect sense to me: my childhood was the cause of the horrible way I felt, and if I avoided my family, then I'd feel better.

      "bodyText": "My daughter, who is 32, has suffered from depression for the past seven years. She received counselling and is now on medication. Though happily married with a lovely home and a responsible job, she has low self-esteem which has brought her to the brink of suicide. Recently, she wrote to me blaming me for her illness, and accusing me of criticising her and favouring her sisters. She says every encounter with me leaves her distressed, and has decided she does not want to see me again. I was devastated by this and wrote back to her, but there has been no response. My husband and I divorced when she was 17, and I am aware of the pain it caused, but we separated amicably. I want my daughter to have the help that will enable her to see her childhood in a more balanced way. Any suggestions? Her view is as valid As the divorced mother of a daughter a few years older than yours, I would be distraught to be told that she never wanted to see me again. However, as one who has suffered from depression, I find myself identifying with your daughter. I also felt undervalued by my mother, and she seemed to favour my siblings. When I went into therapy she said she would never accept that she was to blame for my problems. After struggling for many years, I finally took control of my life through counselling/psychotherapy. Is it possible that your daughter has been enabled to come to terms with the past through counselling? Who is to say that counselling has not given her a balanced view of her childhood? Could not her perspective be at least as valid as yours? Is there someone - friend, relative, minister - with whom you could talk this through? I hope that this, and the love you have for your daughter, will enable you to support her, whatever decisions she makes about her life. Show her you love her Three years ago, I was in a similar situation to your daughter. At the time, it all made perfect sense to me: my childhood was the cause of the horrible way I felt, and if I avoided my family, then I'd feel better. It sounds as if your daughter has found an explanation for her depression that makes sense to her but is causing pain to you. Unfortunately, she is likely to find that her depression won't go away just by avoiding you.

      "body": "<p>So farewell then, Michael Heseltine. The announcement that the former defence secretary and Thatcher assassin is to depart the Commons after the next election leads one to reflect not only on what might have been but also on what is to come for our party.</p> <p>Many might say that the Tory party is losing one of its heavy hitters, that it will be a more lightweight and less balanced party after the next parliament. This is not entirely the case. Heseltine has had his day as an active politician, and he is man enough to admit it. He knows that he is a figure of enough stature to be able to make his point in the future whether he is in the Commons or not.</p> <p>I am no Heseltine fan. For me, he was always too interventionist in the economic sphere and too pro-Europe. But he has always been a reflective and thoughtful politician, and not one given to the sort of crude posturing on social issues that is fast becoming the norm for our party. He would have made an interesting home secretary.</p> <p>It is actually social policy, rather than the euro, that threatens to divide our party today. This week has seen extensive coverage of Steve Norris's reported views that he is disaffected with his party because of its racist and homophobic stance, and of William Hague's call to change the law to protect people who defend themselves against criminals.</p> <p>Norris has been anxious throughout his campaign to present himself as tolerant and open to diversity. A campaign built around such tactics - opposition to section 28 and support for the Macpherson report - has led to real division within the London Conservative party. There is now a significant number of Conservative activists, including elected representatives, who will not vote for Norris, full stop. They will put their cross next to the Tory assembly candidate, and next to the Tory party for the top-up list, but they will not back Norris.</p> <p>These activists are, by definition, part of \"the core\" of the Conservative party. They feel that Norris has gone beyond the pale, that, like Heseltine, he is no longer a Conservative and that he does not represent their views. If Norris feels detached, it turns out that for a significant minority of activists the feeling is mutual. It seems that what Norris gains from the swing voters, he will lose from the puritanical roundheads.</p> <p>The tensions within the London Tory party, the dispute between Norris and Hague, the departure of Heseltine, are important because they encapsulate the crossroads at which the Tory party finds itself. Either we can decide to hunker down and appeal to our core vote, which appears to be the leadership's position. Or we can raise our game, broaden our horizon, recognise and embrace change, which is Norris's position.</p> <p>And not just Norris, by all accounts. No one has watched the race for London mayor more closely than Michael Portillo, and not simply because he is a London MP. It is widely known that there are close links between the Norris and Portillo camps. Norris and Portillo share the same liberal outlook and approach on social issues. Thus many see Norris's campaign as a dry run for a possible future Conservative general election campaign.</p> <p>Norris is seen to be extolling the \"Portillo Lite\" approach that we grew to know and love when our favourite former defence secretary was outside parliament, rediscovering himself in the wilderness. If Norris does well - by which I mean if he pushes Dobson into third place, or runs him very close indeed - it will be possible to argue that liberal Conservatism is a net vote winner. We may lose some hardcore diehards, the argument will run, but we will have begun to reach out to a new core of voters. It is a risky strategy, not least because the one-horse race that this election has become makes the experiment difficult to assess.</p> <p>It is also difficult because the leadership of the Conservative party has decided to follow a strategy of leaping on bandwagons. If William Hague had maintained his early approach to compassionate Conservatism, the two strands of Tory thought might be closer together. The latest policies (or more accurately the way they are being spun) on detention centres and gun-wielding homeowners make us look little short of ludicrous. It is also somewhat misguided. The public likes its prejudices, but it actually does not particularly like politicians to pander to them.</p> <p>Out of the two approaches, the Norris approach is closer to Conservatism and the spirit, if you like, of Britain. We want a government that interferes less, in both our economic and social lives.

      "bodyText": "So farewell then, Michael Heseltine. The announcement that the former defence secretary and Thatcher assassin is to depart the Commons after the next election leads one to reflect not only on what might have been but also on what is to come for our party. Many might say that the Tory party is losing one of its heavy hitters, that it will be a more lightweight and less balanced party after the next parliament. This is not entirely the case. Heseltine has had his day as an active politician, and he is man enough to admit it. He knows that he is a figure of enough stature to be able to make his point in the future whether he is in the Commons or not. I am no Heseltine fan. For me, he was always too interventionist in the economic sphere and too pro-Europe. But he has always been a reflective and thoughtful politician, and not one given to the sort of crude posturing on social issues that is fast becoming the norm for our party. He would have made an interesting home secretary. It is actually social policy, rather than the euro, that threatens to divide our party today. This week has seen extensive coverage of Steve Norris's reported views that he is disaffected with his party because of its racist and homophobic stance, and of William Hague's call to change the law to protect people who defend themselves against criminals. Norris has been anxious throughout his campaign to present himself as tolerant and open to diversity. A campaign built around such tactics - opposition to section 28 and support for the Macpherson report - has led to real division within the London Conservative party. There is now a significant number of Conservative activists, including elected representatives, who will not vote for Norris, full stop. They will put their cross next to the Tory assembly candidate, and next to the Tory party for the top-up list, but they will not back Norris. These activists are, by definition, part of \"the core\" of the Conservative party. They feel that Norris has gone beyond the pale, that, like Heseltine, he is no longer a Conservative and that he does not represent their views. If Norris feels detached, it turns out that for a significant minority of activists the feeling is mutual. It seems that what Norris gains from the swing voters, he will lose from the puritanical roundheads. The tensions within the London Tory party, the dispute between Norris and Hague, the departure of Heseltine, are important because they encapsulate the crossroads at which the Tory party finds itself. Either we can decide to hunker down and appeal to our core vote, which appears to be the leadership's position. Or we can raise our game, broaden our horizon, recognise and embrace change, which is Norris's position. And not just Norris, by all accounts. No one has watched the race for London mayor more closely than Michael Portillo, and not simply because he is a London MP. It is widely known that there are close links between the Norris and Portillo camps. Norris and Portillo share the same liberal outlook and approach on social issues. Thus many see Norris's campaign as a dry run for a possible future Conservative general election campaign. Norris is seen to be extolling the \"Portillo Lite\" approach that we grew to know and love when our favourite former defence secretary was outside parliament, rediscovering himself in the wilderness. If Norris does well - by which I mean if he pushes Dobson into third place, or runs him very close indeed - it will be possible to argue that liberal Conservatism is a net vote winner. We may lose some hardcore diehards, the argument will run, but we will have begun to reach out to a new core of voters. It is a risky strategy, not least because the one-horse race that this election has become makes the experiment difficult to assess. It is also difficult because the leadership of the Conservative party has decided to follow a strategy of leaping on bandwagons. If William Hague had maintained his early approach to compassionate Conservatism, the two strands of Tory thought might be closer together. The latest policies (or more accurately the way they are being spun) on detention centres and gun-wielding homeowners make us look little short of ludicrous. It is also somewhat misguided. The public likes its prejudices, but it actually does not particularly like politicians to pander to them. Out of the two approaches, the Norris approach is closer to Conservatism and the spirit, if you like, of Britain. We want a government that interferes less, in both our economic and social lives. We do not want a government that legislates on outrage, be it dangerous dogs or dangerous homeowners. It used to be said that general elections were determined by the London effect. It seems that the future of our party may be determined by how we react to the Norris effect. \u0095 Ed Vaizey was a Conservative candidate at the last election",

Sitting at Camp Zeist, a converted US airbase, Lord Sutherland ruled that he saw no reason to delay further the start of proceedings against Abdelbaset Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, who have been in custody for well over a year. The Libyans, seated in the dock behind a bullet-proof glass screen and flanked by Scottish policemen, listened through headphones to an Arabic translation of the proceedings. They looked relieved as the three-hour hearing ended with a stern rebuke from the bench for both defence and prosecution. It was \"singularly unhelpful to indulge in attempts to blame each other over preparations for a case of unprecedented complexity,\" said Lord Sutherland, adding that the accused had been in custody for an unprecedented length of time. \"I am not satisfied that postponement is necessary.\" Colin Boyd QC, Scotland's lord advocate, had argued that the late release of a list of defence witnesses, just before the Easter holiday, meant that prosecutors could not make adequate preparations. Starting next Wednesday, the court will call more than 1,000 prosecution witnesses, some disguised to protect their identity, and explore a mass of forensic evidence and conflicting theories about who carried out the worst act of mass murder in British history. Two hundred and seventy people, including 190 Americans, died when Pan Am Flight 103, en route from London to New York, exploded over Lockerbie on December 21 1988. The Libyans, said to be intelligence agents, surrendered last April after years of stalemate and diplomatic wrangling. Jim Swire, whose daughter was killed in the bombing and who has worked tirelessly to secure a Scottish trial in the Netherlands, said after the hearing: \"It is a relief beyond belief that this is going ahead.\" Postponement would have caused grave logistical problems to relatives and witnesses, involving changes to long-booked flights and hotel accommodation in the vicinity of Camp Zeist, formally declared sovereign territory for the duration of the trial. Scottish policemen armed with machine guns patrolled the court, emblazoned with the sign \"High Court of Justiciary\". The accused, who looked fit and pleased to see half a dozen visiting relatives in the public gallery, were brought by van from the adjoining prison block. Dr Swire said it was the first time that he had seen the two Libyans in the flesh. \"I did not find it an emotional shock,\" he told reporters, \"because I've seen so many video and mug shots of them.\" Bill Taylor QC, representing Megrahi, indicated that his client would mount a \"special defence\" intended to incriminate others - members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, the subject of investigations in Germany. Mr Boyd said he regretted seeking postponement by \"an absolute minimum\" of eight weeks. But he complained that only 31 of 124 witnesses named by the defence were previously known to the prosecution when they were received last Thursday. Many of those were Libyans to whom, previous experience showed, access could be difficult. Other witnesses are also based in Malta, Sweden, Germany and the United States. \"The Crown have been placed in an invidious position by the actions of the defence,\" he said. Mr Taylor rebuffed the claims, accusing the Crown of failing to follow up leads and having been aware of many witnesses since 1990 or earlier. Lord Sutherland said a major factor in his decision to reject the postponement request was the fact that the accused had already spent an unprecedented period in custody. Crown evidence is expected to show that the bomb that downed the plane was hidden in a tape recorder, packed in a suitcase in Malta and placed aboard a plane bound for Frankfurt, London, and New York, using fake luggage tags.",

Meteorologists warned that it could be the most arid period since the 1988-89 drought which caused losses of $54bn (\u00a334bn) and is now considered the worst natural disaster in US history.</p> <p>The worst-hit areas are southern Texas and southwestern Louisiana, which has had a little over a third of its normal rainfall so far this year. Even more worryingly, the drought extends over the main grain-producing states of the midwest: Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Michigan and Indiana.</p> <p>Most of these states have had 15 and 30cm less rain than normal since last summer, and there have been pockets where the situation has been worse. Kansas City, Missouri, for example, has had the driest April since records began.</p> <p>\"An unusual aspect is that this drought covers a very wide area of the midwest,\" said Michael Palecki, a climatologist at the Midwestern Regional Climate Centre in Illinois. \"All the way from central Nebraska to southern Michigan - that's a very wide expanse for a drought.\"</p> <p>As the spring drought warning was issued, the US secretary of commerce, William Daley, declared: \"The news is not good. The drought of 1999 remains with us in the new century, and our data indicate drought conditions are proba bly going to get worse before they get better.\"</p> <p>The drought is being blamed on the La Nina phenomenon, which has been distorting weather patterns across North America.</p> <p>Extremely low winter snowfall has also affected the Great Lakes along the US-Canadian border, where water levels have dropped by a metre in three years, leaving lake beds exposed. If the summer is as dry as predicted, the lakes will reach their lowest levels since records began 120 years ago.</p> <p>As the water level drops, the average temperature of the lakes rises, accelerating evaporation and completing a vicious circle that can only be broken by substantial rainfall. The drought has already had a serious impact on shipping, fishing and tourism, which are pillars of the local economy.</p> <p>A series of thunderstorms last week moistened the topsoil in the midwest, tinting the prairies green, but any hope could prove illusory, said Douglas LeComte, a climate expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p> <p>\"The storms have given the farmers some respite,\" he said, \"But that doesn't change our concern about the amount of moisture in reserve for the next few months. When you dig below the surface there's very little moisture at all.\"</p> <p>Mr Palecki, of the Midwestern Climate Centre, described conditions below the topsoil as a \"ticking time bomb\", explaining that last year's crops had tapped much of the sub-surface moisture, sucking it dry.</p> <p>To replenish groundwater in the midwest, meteorologists estimate that states such as Missouri would need up to 25cm of rain spread out over several storms in the next few weeks. That would represent unusually heavy precipitation, which does not appear likely.</p> <p>\"The outlook is not too rosy for the next few months from May to July. That's why we're so worried,\" Mr LeComte said.</p> <p>The summer is expected to be both dry and unusually hot. The past nine months are already the second warmest in over a century, according to the Midwestern centre.</p> <p>The forecasts sound like death knells for midwestern farms. A University of Missouri study found that 17% of the state's farmers were at risk of going out of business because of the 1999 drought, and that another 32% could go under financially if the extraordinary arid spell continues for a few more months.</p> <p>The potential economic damage is not restricted to arable farming. In Texas and the midwest, streams and water-holes are disappearing, threatening livestock. And even before the summer gets under way, the unusual conditions have triggered forest fires, especially in the Ozark forests in southern Missouri.</p> <p>Doug Halliwell, a firefighting supervisor in the state's conservation department, said: \"I've had at least 50,000 acres of timber burn since March 1. That's a conservative estimate.\"</p>",

Kansas City, Missouri, for example, has had the driest April since records began. \"An unusual aspect is that this drought covers a very wide area of the midwest,\" said Michael Palecki, a climatologist at the Midwestern Regional Climate Centre in Illinois. \"All the way from central Nebraska to southern Michigan - that's a very wide expanse for a drought.\" As the spring drought warning was issued, the US secretary of commerce, William Daley, declared: \"The news is not good. The drought of 1999 remains with us in the new century, and our data indicate drought conditions are proba bly going to get worse before they get better.\" The drought is being blamed on the La Nina phenomenon, which has been distorting weather patterns across North America. Extremely low winter snowfall has also affected the Great Lakes along the US-Canadian border, where water levels have dropped by a metre in three years, leaving lake beds exposed. If the summer is as dry as predicted, the lakes will reach their lowest levels since records began 120 years ago. As the water level drops, the average temperature of the lakes rises, accelerating evaporation and completing a vicious circle that can only be broken by substantial rainfall. The drought has already had a serious impact on shipping, fishing and tourism, which are pillars of the local economy. A series of thunderstorms last week moistened the topsoil in the midwest, tinting the prairies green, but any hope could prove illusory, said Douglas LeComte, a climate expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"The storms have given the farmers some respite,\" he said, \"But that doesn't change our concern about the amount of moisture in reserve for the next few months. When you dig below the surface there's very little moisture at all.\" Mr Palecki, of the Midwestern Climate Centre, described conditions below the topsoil as a \"ticking time bomb\", explaining that last year's crops had tapped much of the sub-surface moisture, sucking it dry. To replenish groundwater in the midwest, meteorologists estimate that states such as Missouri would need up to 25cm of rain spread out over several storms in the next few weeks. That would represent unusually heavy precipitation, which does not appear likely. \"The outlook is not too rosy for the next few months from May to July. That's why we're so worried,\" Mr LeComte said. The summer is expected to be both dry and unusually hot. The past nine months are already the second warmest in over a century, according to the Midwestern centre. The forecasts sound like death knells for midwestern farms. A University of Missouri study found that 17% of the state's farmers were at risk of going out of business because of the 1999 drought, and that another 32% could go under financially if the extraordinary arid spell continues for a few more months. The potential economic damage is not restricted to arable farming. In Texas and the midwest, streams and water-holes are disappearing, threatening livestock. And even before the summer gets under way, the unusual conditions have triggered forest fires, especially in the Ozark forests in southern Missouri. Doug Halliwell, a firefighting supervisor in the state's conservation department, said: \"I've had at least 50,000 acres of timber burn since March 1. That's a conservative estimate.\"",

      "body": "<p>Floods are events of the moment. Droughts are disasters on a slow fuse. Both happen with or without global warming.</p> <p>But the drought and famine in Ethiopia, the desiccation of Rajasthan, the arid cornland of the US west, and the towns in Mozambique and Venezuela swept by storms and floods, are beginning to look like pieces in the same ominous jigsaw.</p> <p>\"You can't ever say that a hurricane or a flood or a drought is because of global warming,\" said one disaster expert yesterday. \"What you can say is that global warming makes any of these or all of them more likely.\"</p> <p>One of the first predicted results of the greenhouse effect was that a warmer world would be accompanied by a greater frequency of \"extreme\" events. This is because more heat should mean more evaporation and more wind energy, and therefore more violence.</p> <p>So far, events have matched predictions with an eerie precision. Islands usually hit by a cyclone once in a century have been pounded four times in a decade. Rivers that used to dry up once every few decades are now failing to reach the sea on 100 or more days a year. Seven of the hottest years ever recorded were in the 1990s and the three next hottest were in the 1980s - and during the last decade the cost of natural disasters added up to four times the bill of the 1980s.</p> <p>The hottest year of the decade was 1998. It was also, according to the reinsurance giant Munich Re, one of the most expensive, with a total of 80 separate natural catastrophes attributed to the influence of El Nino, a cyclic blister of heat in the Pacific which periodically tips climate patterns upside down, sparking fires in tropical rainforests and floods on barren lands.</p> <p>That year was marked by terrible floods in China, calamitous ice storms in the US, and a huge pall of smoke and flames over Indonesia. It also saw some of the most destructive hurricanes ever to hit central America, demolishing hillsides and sweeping away villages and cropland.</p> <p>And Red Cross experts pointed out that the following year, 1999 - the fifth hottest recorded for the planet as a whole - was almost as bad, with floods and windstorms battering communities which were only just beginning to recover from the last wave.</p> <p>Storms are reported by governments and the news media as single and separate events, but they are not. When winds die down and floodwaters ebb away, life does not return to normal. Victims will have lost their homes, their livestock and their savings, and they will face malnutrition and waterborne diseases.</p> <p>And a year or two later, when the land is green again, they could also face plagues of locusts. For most of the time, locusts dwell in little groups in arid regions. But every few years, after rain has multiplied the vegetation, they suddenly swarm. One swarm in north Africa in 1988 was measured at 75 miles by 16 miles. It was estimated to contain 150bn insects consuming 300,000 tonnes of greenstuff a day.</p> <p>\"You don't see soil any more, you don't see plants,\" said one scientist. \"It covers everything like a thick, natural fabric. All you hear is chewing.\"</p> <p>Scientists working together have helped limit locust plagues around the Mediterranean, and meteorologists warn governments and each other about windstorms and floods, but drought is another matter.</p> <p>Droughts tend to do their worst on land that is already arid, and where societies are on the margin. In a world where rain is rare, people can cope with a dry year or two, but then, quite quickly, the wells fail, and the livestock begins to die. The first sign of famine is usually a sudden series of grain price rises in local markets. Within weeks, gaunt figures begin to appear on the edges of towns.</p> <p>Global warming will magnify all these problems. Rising sea levels will multiply storm surges and higher sea surface temperatures will guarantee more frequent hurricanes. But the real cost is likely to be imposed by the failure of rivers and the desiccation of the soil.</p> <p>Everywhere in the northern hemisphere, glaciers are in retreat. Farmers in India and Pakistan who depend on spring floods face ruin in years to come. The Yellow River - which once flooded so often it was known as China's sorrow - failed to reach the sea on 226 days in 1997. Texas is losing irrigated land at 1% per year.</p> <p>The problem is magnified even more by population growth. Each year, there are another 80m potential victims, most of them in the developing world.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Floods are events of the moment. Droughts are disasters on a slow fuse. Both happen with or without global warming. But the drought and famine in Ethiopia, the desiccation of Rajasthan, the arid cornland of the US west, and the towns in Mozambique and Venezuela swept by storms and floods, are beginning to look like pieces in the same ominous jigsaw. \"You can't ever say that a hurricane or a flood or a drought is because of global warming,\" said one disaster expert yesterday. \"What you can say is that global warming makes any of these or all of them more likely.\" One of the first predicted results of the greenhouse effect was that a warmer world would be accompanied by a greater frequency of \"extreme\" events. This is because more heat should mean more evaporation and more wind energy, and therefore more violence. So far, events have matched predictions with an eerie precision. Islands usually hit by a cyclone once in a century have been pounded four times in a decade. Rivers that used to dry up once every few decades are now failing to reach the sea on 100 or more days a year. Seven of the hottest years ever recorded were in the 1990s and the three next hottest were in the 1980s - and during the last decade the cost of natural disasters added up to four times the bill of the 1980s. The hottest year of the decade was 1998. It was also, according to the reinsurance giant Munich Re, one of the most expensive, with a total of 80 separate natural catastrophes attributed to the influence of El Nino, a cyclic blister of heat in the Pacific which periodically tips climate patterns upside down, sparking fires in tropical rainforests and floods on barren lands. That year was marked by terrible floods in China, calamitous ice storms in the US, and a huge pall of smoke and flames over Indonesia. It also saw some of the most destructive hurricanes ever to hit central America, demolishing hillsides and sweeping away villages and cropland. And Red Cross experts pointed out that the following year, 1999 - the fifth hottest recorded for the planet as a whole - was almost as bad, with floods and windstorms battering communities which were only just beginning to recover from the last wave. Storms are reported by governments and the news media as single and separate events, but they are not. When winds die down and floodwaters ebb away, life does not return to normal. Victims will have lost their homes, their livestock and their savings, and they will face malnutrition and waterborne diseases. And a year or two later, when the land is green again, they could also face plagues of locusts. For most of the time, locusts dwell in little groups in arid regions. But every few years, after rain has multiplied the vegetation, they suddenly swarm. One swarm in north Africa in 1988 was measured at 75 miles by 16 miles. It was estimated to contain 150bn insects consuming 300,000 tonnes of greenstuff a day. \"You don't see soil any more, you don't see plants,\" said one scientist. \"It covers everything like a thick, natural fabric. All you hear is chewing.\" Scientists working together have helped limit locust plagues around the Mediterranean, and meteorologists warn governments and each other about windstorms and floods, but drought is another matter. Droughts tend to do their worst on land that is already arid, and where societies are on the margin. In a world where rain is rare, people can cope with a dry year or two, but then, quite quickly, the wells fail, and the livestock begins to die. The first sign of famine is usually a sudden series of grain price rises in local markets. Within weeks, gaunt figures begin to appear on the edges of towns. Global warming will magnify all these problems. Rising sea levels will multiply storm surges and higher sea surface temperatures will guarantee more frequent hurricanes. But the real cost is likely to be imposed by the failure of rivers and the desiccation of the soil. Everywhere in the northern hemisphere, glaciers are in retreat. Farmers in India and Pakistan who depend on spring floods face ruin in years to come. The Yellow River - which once flooded so often it was known as China's sorrow - failed to reach the sea on 226 days in 1997. Texas is losing irrigated land at 1% per year. The problem is magnified even more by population growth. Each year, there are another 80m potential victims, most of them in the developing world.",

The security files released at the Public Record Office also show that British intelligence knew IRA members were working in key British military installations in Northern Ireland, but failed to dismiss them to \"save War Office embarrassment\". The monthly reports written by successive directors of military intelligence show that nothing was done about the flow of IRA recruits from southern Ireland joining the army until an IRA attack on the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers' main training camp at Blandford, Dorset, in February 1958. Military intelligence believed that an IRA man stationed at the camp had acted as an informant and taken part in the attack. Six months later intelligence officers began to vet new army recruits who applied from southern Irish addresses, but a similar attempt to screen Northern Irish recruits for IRA members was blocked by the Stormont government. Military intelligence was convinced that IRA men \"often with their wives or women members of the organisation\" visited Northern Ireland posing as tourists to log police movements and the deployment of military personnel and civil flights at Nutt's Corner airport, near Belfast. In April 1959, the IRA chief of staff ordered reconnaissance patrols into Northern Ireland to report on the security forces. The monthly security reports, which were circulated to only the 20 most senior figures in Whitehall, including the cabinet's joint intelligence committee, put the strength of the IRA in the late 1950s at about 1,000 in Eire and about 100 men operating in Northern Ireland. In May 1957 the director of military intelligence reported: \"There are 14 known IRA members and active sympathisers employed in military installations in Northern Ireland... the RUC advised the dismissal of these employees on the logical grounds that their presence in military units would make these units more vulnerable to IRA attacks. \"However as they are civilian employees it has been decided that, rather than stir up trouble through their dismissal, the risk caused by their presence has to be accepted.\" Again in October 1957 he complained of \"20 cases\" in the army. \"This gives strength to the belief that members of the IRA sometimes join the British Army to gain military training and to be in a position to give information about camps and guards with a view to future attacks. It was only after the attack on the REME training headquarters at Blandford that the army began to vet applications from potential recruits from Dublin. A proposal to extend the circulation of the monthly security reports from 20 copies to 150 key people in Whitehall and Belfast was met with the threat from the RUC that if that happened, they would no longer share their intelligence. \"It would be extremely difficult to persuade the Ulster authorities that so wide a distribution can be made without considerable risk that some nationalist-minded person would come to see it,\" the head of MI5 (whose name is deleted from the file) told Brigadier C H Tarver, the deputy director of military intelligence.",

According to LuPone, Merrick felt that the audience didn't want to listen to a seven-minute song at that point in the show. She went on to make Meadowlark one of her signature songs. \"He might've been a shark but he was nice to everyone,\" she observed of Merrick. \"I thought he was a cool guy.\"</p> <p>Apparently, a small army of carpenters, electricians and songwriters felt the same way, since he often worked with the same people over his quarter-century heyday from 1955-80, during which he produced the bulk of his 80 shows.

Merrick never admitted to taking the disappearing pages, but according to press agent Josh Ellis he cryptically said, \"Perhaps the FBI can find our meadowlark.\" By LuPone's account, the incident happened in Boston where Merrick was overheard saying at the local bar that he'd get rid of the song even \"if I have to poison the birdseed\".

Although he worked with the Norwich Lads Club Band, Sprowston Band, and Taverham Bands, his main achievement was to re-establish the Stalham Brass Band, the oldest band in East Anglia, after the second world war. With that band he notched up more than 1,000 performances, leading the players in charity concerts, Armistice day appearances, and Christmas carol tours.</p> <p>Thirst devoted his life to music. As a schoolboy, he took up the cornet, but switched to the euphonium for the rest of his life.</p> <p>Born in Stalham, Norfolk Thirst went to Paston Grammar School, and in 1932 became a clerk for the Midland and Great Northern railways - apart from the war years he spent his working life on the railways. During the second world war, Thirst served in the Royal Navy, rising to petty officer telegraphist, and serving on HMS Cold streamer, an escort for fast North Atlantic convoys.</p> <p>Back in Stalham, he became a relief station master - which took him to every station in the region - and set about rebuilding the Stalham Brass Band as its players gradually returned from the war. He also provided entertainment in the area with his own dance band, the Skyliners. It was through their joint love of music that he met his wife Yvonne, when she joined the dance band.</p> <p>In 1978, Thirst started working with the Stalham Middle School Brass Band, which I conduct, coming in each week on a voluntary basis. His reward was to see young musicians progress. Some of the young players even bestowed on him the title of honorary grandfather.</p> <p>By the time of his retirement, he was head of the technical section at British Rail's Norwich base. In 1999, The Guinness Book of World Records acknowledged him as the longest serving musical conductor. He was made an MBE in this year's New Year's honours list for his services to music. His last engagement with the Stalham Brass Band was for a Hymns Of Praise CD.</p> <p>He is survived by Yvonne and his son Tim, the present musical director of the Stalham Brass Band.</p> <p>\u0095 Gerald Thirst, musician and conductor, born October 29 1915; died April 1 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gerald Thirst, who has died aged 84, was a legendary music man who stood at the helm of Norfolk's brass bands for a record-breaking 50 years. Although he worked with the Norwich Lads Club Band, Sprowston Band, and Taverham Bands, his main achievement was to re-establish the Stalham Brass Band, the oldest band in East Anglia, after the second world war. With that band he notched up more than 1,000 performances, leading the players in charity concerts, Armistice day appearances, and Christmas carol tours. Thirst devoted his life to music. As a schoolboy, he took up the cornet, but switched to the euphonium for the rest of his life. Born in Stalham, Norfolk Thirst went to Paston Grammar School, and in 1932 became a clerk for the Midland and Great Northern railways - apart from the war years he spent his working life on the railways. During the second world war, Thirst served in the Royal Navy, rising to petty officer telegraphist, and serving on HMS Cold streamer, an escort for fast North Atlantic convoys. Back in Stalham, he became a relief station master - which took him to every station in the region - and set about rebuilding the Stalham Brass Band as its players gradually returned from the war. He also provided entertainment in the area with his own dance band, the Skyliners. It was through their joint love of music that he met his wife Yvonne, when she joined the dance band. In 1978, Thirst started working with the Stalham Middle School Brass Band, which I conduct, coming in each week on a voluntary basis. His reward was to see young musicians progress. Some of the young players even bestowed on him the title of honorary grandfather. By the time of his retirement, he was head of the technical section at British Rail's Norwich base. In 1999, The Guinness Book of World Records acknowledged him as the longest serving musical conductor. He was made an MBE in this year's New Year's honours list for his services to music. His last engagement with the Stalham Brass Band was for a Hymns Of Praise CD. He is survived by Yvonne and his son Tim, the present musical director of the Stalham Brass Band. \u0095 Gerald Thirst, musician and conductor, born October 29 1915; died April 1 2000",

The family had apparently been confused by Mr Cooper's dark skin and hair, and wrongly identified the body after it was found by police. Mr Cooper, who suffered from angina, had split off from his tour group, then collapsed and died of a heart attack. Mrs Cooper, who was distraught when the travel firm Thomson reported that her husband was missing, is fighting to overturn an Italian law banning exhumation for 22 months, so that she can re-bury her husband in Britain. \"He always looked like he was of foreign origin,\" she said. \"He went very dark in the hot weather and had very dark hair.\" A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"The Italian man had been reported missing in Calabria and somehow the family managed to identify Mr Cooper's body as his. \"They immediately alerted the authorities when their relative walked in through the front door. It is not known where he had been. \"We have been in touch with Mr Cooper's family and the local magistrate to appoint an undertaker at this end and get Mr Cooper's papers ready. \"Our consulate in Naples is also trying to get an exemption on the burial rule.\"",

The newspapers are challenging a judge's order to hand over any documents or emails relating to Mr Shayler, particularly his claim MI6 was involved in a plot to assassinate Libyan leader Colonel Gadafy. Skaters get new honour Ice skaters Jane Torvill and Christopher Dean returned to Buckingham Palace yesterday to collect OBEs to add to the MBEs they received almost 20 years ago. The pair won gold at the Sarajevo Olympics in1984 for their interpretation of Ravel's Bolero. Potter in line for prize JK Rowling's third novel about her boy wizard, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, has been shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal, the UK's oldest children's book prize. The novel won this year's Whitbread Children's Book of the Year and came a close second to Irish poet Seamus Heaney's Beowulf in the competition's overall book of the year category. \u00a35,000 for Xmas card A 1966 Christmas card from John Lennon to Beatles' manager Brian Epstein fetched \u00a35,405 at Christie's in London yesterday. The hand-drawn card, saying Happy Christian Brian from John, was an ironic reference to Epstein's Jewish faith. Epstein's 18 carat gold watch went for \u00a32,820 and three of his 1957 notebooks, giving a frank account of his homosexuality, made \u00a33,290. But the bulk of an archive of diaries and notebooks failed to find buyers. All in the mind Hypnosis can reduce pain during surgery when patients are not given general anaesthetic, a study has found. Researchers who studied 241 patients during minor operations found those who were hypnotised were more comfortable than those just comforted by nurses, according to the research led by Elvira Lang, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre, Boston, in the United States. Ones that got away Thieves drained 35,000 gallons of water from a fish pond in Hagley, Worcestershire, to steal 30 Japanese koi carp worth thousands of pounds, West Mercia police said yesterday.",

He had been connected to a respirator since February, after his condition worsened.</p> <p>Mr Shinohara was one of two employees of the nuclear fuel company JCO exposed to massive levels of radiation during the accident on September 30 at the firm's uranium processing plant in Tokaimura, 80 miles north-east of Tokyo. Mr Shinohara and Hisashi Ouchi set off an uncontrolled chain reaction after mistakenly pouring too much uranium into a processing tank.</p> <p>Mr Ouchi, 35, died last December, becoming the first fatality in Japan's civil nuclear power programme. A third worker, Yutaka Yokokawa, who was in an adjacent room when the accident occurred, was released from hospital the same month.</p> <p>Yoshiro Mori, the prime minister, described Mr Shinohara's death as \"extremely regrettable\", and vowed to continue tightening up safety at Japan's nuclear power facilities. Hirofumi Nakasone, head of the science and technology agency, visited the hospital yesterday morning to offer the government's condolences to Mr Shinohara's family.</p> <p>Doctors at Tokyo University Hospital, where Mr Shinohara had been treated since April 10, paid tribute to his courage. Kazuhiko Maekawa, head of the hospital's intensive care unit, said treating Mr Shinohara had made him aware of the limitations of medical science. \"I was overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness in the face of something caused by human arrogance,\" he said.</p> <p>At one point, Mr Shinohara's condition had shown signs of improvement. He received a blood transfusion in October, and on New Year's Day was well enough to venture into the garden at Tokyo University's institute of medical science in his wheelchair. In late February, however, doctors placed him on a respirator when pneumonia and radiation damage to his respiratory system brought on severe breathing difficulties.</p> <p>Mr Shinohara, was married, with three children. He joined JCO's predecessor in 1984. Two years ago, he was placed in charge of processing nuclear fuel for the Joyo fast-breeder nuclear reactor not far from the Tokaimura plant.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A second worker exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation during Japan's worst nuclear accident last September died yesterday morning at a hospital in Tokyo. Masato Shinohara, 40, died of multiple organ failure, doctors said. He had been connected to a respirator since February, after his condition worsened. Mr Shinohara was one of two employees of the nuclear fuel company JCO exposed to massive levels of radiation during the accident on September 30 at the firm's uranium processing plant in Tokaimura, 80 miles north-east of Tokyo. Mr Shinohara and Hisashi Ouchi set off an uncontrolled chain reaction after mistakenly pouring too much uranium into a processing tank. Mr Ouchi, 35, died last December, becoming the first fatality in Japan's civil nuclear power programme. A third worker, Yutaka Yokokawa, who was in an adjacent room when the accident occurred, was released from hospital the same month. Yoshiro Mori, the prime minister, described Mr Shinohara's death as \"extremely regrettable\", and vowed to continue tightening up safety at Japan's nuclear power facilities. Hirofumi Nakasone, head of the science and technology agency, visited the hospital yesterday morning to offer the government's condolences to Mr Shinohara's family. Doctors at Tokyo University Hospital, where Mr Shinohara had been treated since April 10, paid tribute to his courage. Kazuhiko Maekawa, head of the hospital's intensive care unit, said treating Mr Shinohara had made him aware of the limitations of medical science. \"I was overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness in the face of something caused by human arrogance,\" he said. At one point, Mr Shinohara's condition had shown signs of improvement. He received a blood transfusion in October, and on New Year's Day was well enough to venture into the garden at Tokyo University's institute of medical science in his wheelchair. In late February, however, doctors placed him on a respirator when pneumonia and radiation damage to his respiratory system brought on severe breathing difficulties. Mr Shinohara, was married, with three children. He joined JCO's predecessor in 1984. Two years ago, he was placed in charge of processing nuclear fuel for the Joyo fast-breeder nuclear reactor not far from the Tokaimura plant.",

      "body": "<p>It is 1979. The depths of the London underworld. A flat-nosed fellow, built like an ape and dressed in a pinstriped suit, enters a bustling pub. He stands alone at one end of the bar wearing a menacing expression of barely controlled fury.</p> <p> The other heavies in the pub recognise him as Harold Shand, terrifying crime overlord, and greet him with an appropriate mixture of reverence and fear. He smiles, knowing that he will soon have all of them hanging upside down from meat hooks in an abattoir.</p> <p>Twenty-one years later and London's underworld is looking pretty much the same. Familiar-looking ruffians occupy an almost identically seedy pub. But one thing has changed. Bounding towards hard-nut HQ is a svelte, bronze-skinned young man with pretty, almost feline features. His hair is neatly gelled and he is wearing baggy jeans and a shiny tracksuit top that is undone to the midriff.</p> <p>Surely this unsuspecting scamp has lost his way en route to the disco and will soon find himself unceremoniously redirected by the nasty types he is about to encounter in the pub? But wait... As he swaggers past the bomber-jacketed doormen, they greet him warmly with a nod of respect and the words: \"Hello, Jude.\"</p> <p>As it transpires, this Jude character is a distant successor to the late Harold Shand. He is, we are to discover, currently running the criminal activities of the capital with an iron rod. But it appears he has traded in the personal abattoir for some expensive home-tanning equipment. Has the London underworld really declined to such an extent over the last couple of decades?</p> <p>If the cinema is to be believed, then yes. It was Bob Hoskins who portrayed Harold Shand in The Long Good Friday in the late 70s. His was a sinister, convincing performance in a complex and disturbing thriller. Its re-release next week will strike an unsympathetic contrast with the insufferable Brit-pack affair that is Love, Honour and Obey. In it, we are asked to suspend our disbelief while Jude Law portrays a scary villain, governing the sprawling mob of his even scarier Uncle Ray, played (naturally enough) by Ray Winstone.</p> <p>It marks the trend - but probably not the end - of recent British movies that have sullied a tradition established by the likes of The Long Good Friday, by employing a new creative technique: the gangster flick by numbers. Forget real drama and characters you can believe in, these films have found that a moody soundtrack, sharp suits and a script laden with do-me-a-favour dialogue is enough to fill cinemas.</p> <p>It is clear that, over the last couple of years, film companies have been falling over themselves to fund such ventures. Hence the current avalanche of films in which silly-billy cockneys call each other \"slags\" and make frequent threats to cut each others fingers orff. Hot on the heels of Love, Honour and Obey come Circus, with John Hannah, Essex Boys starring Sean Bean, Sexy Beast, with Ben Kingsley, and three of All Saints in Dave Stewart's Honest.</p> <p>Who is to blame? Quite possibly Guy Ritchie, who, with the successful Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, reintroduced the gangster genre to the British film industry as a viable alternative to costume dramas. Apart from anything else, red-blooded British actors must have been desperate for roles with more potential for drama than a slap round the face with a handkerchief.</p> <p>Lock, Stock brought some much needed action and adventure to British cinema: it had a twisted plot, a gag-per-minute-script and a lot of charismatic-looking blokes with quick-witted tongues.</p> <p> But, other than its setting, it shared few similarities with the great British gangster films of the past. The Long Good Friday and Get Carter were bleak affairs that dealt with big, black themes of betrayal and paranoia. At their centre were complex characters who simmered with internal conflicts and eventually boiled over into dramatic violence.</p> <p>In Get Carter, Michael Caine is trying to do what he believes is right by avenging the death of his brother.

      "bodyText": "It is 1979. The depths of the London underworld. A flat-nosed fellow, built like an ape and dressed in a pinstriped suit, enters a bustling pub. He stands alone at one end of the bar wearing a menacing expression of barely controlled fury. The other heavies in the pub recognise him as Harold Shand, terrifying crime overlord, and greet him with an appropriate mixture of reverence and fear. He smiles, knowing that he will soon have all of them hanging upside down from meat hooks in an abattoir. Twenty-one years later and London's underworld is looking pretty much the same. Familiar-looking ruffians occupy an almost identically seedy pub. But one thing has changed. Bounding towards hard-nut HQ is a svelte, bronze-skinned young man with pretty, almost feline features. His hair is neatly gelled and he is wearing baggy jeans and a shiny tracksuit top that is undone to the midriff. Surely this unsuspecting scamp has lost his way en route to the disco and will soon find himself unceremoniously redirected by the nasty types he is about to encounter in the pub? But wait... As he swaggers past the bomber-jacketed doormen, they greet him warmly with a nod of respect and the words: \"Hello, Jude.\" As it transpires, this Jude character is a distant successor to the late Harold Shand. He is, we are to discover, currently running the criminal activities of the capital with an iron rod. But it appears he has traded in the personal abattoir for some expensive home-tanning equipment. Has the London underworld really declined to such an extent over the last couple of decades? If the cinema is to be believed, then yes. It was Bob Hoskins who portrayed Harold Shand in The Long Good Friday in the late 70s. His was a sinister, convincing performance in a complex and disturbing thriller. Its re-release next week will strike an unsympathetic contrast with the insufferable Brit-pack affair that is Love, Honour and Obey. In it, we are asked to suspend our disbelief while Jude Law portrays a scary villain, governing the sprawling mob of his even scarier Uncle Ray, played (naturally enough) by Ray Winstone. It marks the trend - but probably not the end - of recent British movies that have sullied a tradition established by the likes of The Long Good Friday, by employing a new creative technique: the gangster flick by numbers. Forget real drama and characters you can believe in, these films have found that a moody soundtrack, sharp suits and a script laden with do-me-a-favour dialogue is enough to fill cinemas. It is clear that, over the last couple of years, film companies have been falling over themselves to fund such ventures. Hence the current avalanche of films in which silly-billy cockneys call each other \"slags\" and make frequent threats to cut each others fingers orff. Hot on the heels of Love, Honour and Obey come Circus, with John Hannah, Essex Boys starring Sean Bean, Sexy Beast, with Ben Kingsley, and three of All Saints in Dave Stewart's Honest. Who is to blame? Quite possibly Guy Ritchie, who, with the successful Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, reintroduced the gangster genre to the British film industry as a viable alternative to costume dramas. Apart from anything else, red-blooded British actors must have been desperate for roles with more potential for drama than a slap round the face with a handkerchief. Lock, Stock brought some much needed action and adventure to British cinema: it had a twisted plot, a gag-per-minute-script and a lot of charismatic-looking blokes with quick-witted tongues. But, other than its setting, it shared few similarities with the great British gangster films of the past. The Long Good Friday and Get Carter were bleak affairs that dealt with big, black themes of betrayal and paranoia. At their centre were complex characters who simmered with internal conflicts and eventually boiled over into dramatic violence. In Get Carter, Michael Caine is trying to do what he believes is right by avenging the death of his brother. In the process, he sees himself do so much wrong that his calm exterior gradually crumbles, giving way to murderous rage. In The Long Good Friday, Bob Hoskins endeavours to legitimise the activities of his corporation. But when a shadowy force begins to undermine his efforts, he finally gives in to the savagely violent instincts that made him king of the underworld in the first place. Lock, Stock, on the other hand, depicts a man called Hatchet Harry, who, for a reason that is only thinly explained, beats a victim to death with a sex aid. There lies the key difference between gangster flicks new and old: they used to be fully rounded thrillers which, due to the nature of their setting, would inevitably involve elements of violence and black comedy. Nowadays, the plots are merely coat hangers for that violence and black comedy. It is as if film-makers have set out to devise a story that will conveniently accommodate some imaginative fighting techniques, cheeky cockney one-liners and very 60s design imagery.

      "bodyText": "What was the first film you saw at the cinema? Isadora, by Karel Reisz. I am still disturbed when Vanessa Redgrave is strangled as her scarf gets caught in the wheel of a Bugatti. What's your favourite film? Midnight Cowboy, a film about brotherhood between two of the strangest characters to have graced the screen. When did you last walk out of the cinema and why? I walk out often nowadays. Maybe I'm jaded but films aren't what they used to be. I walked out when Ben Stiller got his penis caught in his zipper in There's Something About Mary. That was enough for me. What's the most erotic moment in a movie? The feast in Babette's Feast. What's the most annoying habit in a cinema? Staying because you paid. When was the last time you snogged at the cinema? Never. Films get my undivided attention. Until I walk. Which actor would you most like to be? I am what I am. Which actress? Liv Ullmann. What's your favourite snatch of film dialogue? The silence between the Tramp and the blind flower lady in City Lights, when she recognises his touch and says: \"It's you.\" Chaplin smiles and nods with eyes lit up by tears. When was the last time you cried in the movies? There's Something About Mary. When was the last time you hid under your seat? Also There's Something About Mary. What do you make of Greg Wise's success, seeing as he was in the same theatre club as you at university? Not only Greg Wise, but also Hamish Clark. In fact, the three of us had a stand up routine called The Thunderbunnies back in the mid-80s, which we may resume in the near future. \u0095 Angus McFadyen plays Orson Welles in Cradle Will Rock.

      "body": "<p>For someone who knows and loves old Hollywood, there might not be an experience you'd envy in a newcomer as much as the first confrontation with the films of Preston Sturges. Hellzapoppin comedies all, the films are wall-to-wall talk; and that talk has a rambunctious life-force, textural depth and hailstorm wit to it that is impossible to mistake for the work of another man. </p> <p>Filled with anxiety, double-meanings and the Golden Era's most affectionately and imaginatively conceived nincompoops, Sturges' films are comic machines too busy throwing pistons and belching fumes to perform a regular movie's mundane work. More than that, Sturges was easily the most transgressive voice in wartime Hollywood - each of his films in turn pivoted on adult issues otherwise forbidden to film-makers in the 40s (how he got away with The Miracle of Morgan's Creek is still a mystery on the scale of what happened to the dinosaurs). He managed to use profane and unseemly topics just by sheer speed and hullabaloo. His career as a director-writer auteur was brief - 12 films, the first and best 10 in merely nine years, from 1940 to 1948. </p> <p>That his career spanned the war years is no small irony: Sturges' brand of acidic hysteria was terminally out of fashion in a culture swooning with comfortable nationalism and home-front ardour. Yet Sturges never recaptured his glory days after the tensions of the era faded - it was, in film critic Penelope Houston's words, \"as though the mainspring of Sturges' comic timing had snapped\". He wouldn't have been the first artist to thrive in a climate antithetical to his impulses, but Sturges was no hermit - his often vicious satire looked squarely at the prejudices and idiocies of wartime American life, class privilege and gender combat. </p> <p>Sturges began as a playwright and then a Hollywood scriptwriter with screenplays for films like The Power and the Glory (1933), The Good Fairy (1935) and Easy Living (1937) establishing a weighty reputation as the best snappy-banter guy in town. (The films' publicity would sometimes include a copy of Sturges' script on display in the theatre lobby, under glass like the Book of Kells.) </p> <p>He sold his original screenplay of The Great McGinty (1940) to Paramount for $10 on condition that he direct it as well. Simultaneously with Mr Carte-Blanche, Orson Welles over at RKO, Sturges invented the writer-director, and went on from there to work in an atmosphere of seeming freedom (from meddling studio censors, at least) that Welles would surely come to envy. Sturges didn't have final cut or anything quite so trendy, but his situation was unprecedented. </p> <p>Whatever his working circumstances, Sturges had the most anarchic comic vision since the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup - and he sustained it for several films and established as its hub the raw foolishness of the average Yankee schmo. His oeuvre stands alone, at the very least, for its effortless commingling of sublimely cheerful nonsense and egg-pitching rancour. </p> <p>A droll satire on corrupt politics, McGinty was a particularly nasty portrait of an amoral louse rising from homelessness to the governor's mansion by sole virtue of his amorality, but Sturges hit his stride with The Lady Eve (1941), Sullivan's Travels (1941), The Palm Beach Story (1942), The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944), Hail the Conquering Hero (1944), Mad Wednesday (1947) and Unfaithfully Yours (1948), each a precision instrument designed to cut deep. </p> <p>The films' brutal edges are not always easily discernible, because Sturges keeps the action whipped up into a hyperventilating froth. But although The Lady Eve is his most conventional movie, it is also his most hair-raisingly sexual, with Barbara Stanwyck toying like an lazy jungle cat with the blush-producing entendres in her mocha-mousse voice, and Henry Fonda driven to a sweaty boil that defines what it feels like to be so aroused you trip over your own feet. </p> <p>Sullivan's Travels is a farce about a pretentious Hollywood writer-director (Joel McCrea) who wants to make exactly the kind of movie Sturges could never tolerate - an \"issue\" drama entitled O Brother, Where Art Thou?, a title soon to be provided with an actual film by the brothers Coen - before the righteous dummy discontentedly goes off-road into Depression-era bum-hood to discover what the people really want.</p> <p>Most critics have seen Sturges' answer to that question - Mickey Mouse - as a cop-out, but while Sturges does let his film get dolefully glum, but to read his film as self-evidently Disneyfied is to see merely one layer of the torte. Sturges was not on a mission, like Sullivan, to serve the people, and the iconic use of Mickey is just the final slap at the innocuous, condescending Hollywood Sturges knew all too well. His contemporary Frank Capra would have believed in that last-reel epiphany; Sturges believes only in double-edging his razor. </p> <p>Sturges's best films all have similar, easy-to-miss ironies, but The Miracle of Morgan's Creek is so fraught with deranged tension about what we imagine the director wants us to think about his characters that by the time it ends, you feel as if you've given birth to the damn thing yourself. What is traditionally conceived as a \"happy ending\" is meaningless in Sturges' jolly galaxy, and what sometimes feels like a dramatic interlude meant to give the comedy emotional bearings is often Sturges' way of making fun of us. </p> <p>In any case, Morgan's Creek is as free of drama - duplicitous or not - as any film ever made, but it's the movie's subject that still makes your jaw drop: in WW2-mired 1944, here was a film about a smalltown ditz named Gertrude Kockenlocker (Betty Hutton) who wakes up one morning with a vague memory of having drunkenly met, eloped with and gotten pregnant by a soldier she can't remember anything about. (Except his name, which was \"something like Ratskywatsky\" - Sturges outplayed even WC Fields's panache with names.)</p> <p>The chaos that ensues once Norval Jones (Eddie Bracken) volunteers to say he's the father goes 18 ways at once, and to see Sturges put those balls in the air and keep them there is to watch narrative comedy at its most superhuman. That Trudy ends up bearing sextuplets, and no one cares or is reminded that there is a real Ratskywatsky, somewhere, is Sturges' final triumph, as hilarious as it is remarkably unchained from the strictures of the all-powerful Production Code. </p> <p>It's a masterpiece, but not alone in its subversiveness. Hail the Conquering Hero, also a wartime freak, dared to mock, viciously, the American worship of war heroes, love of meaningless pomp and devotion to self-congratulating provincialism. Mad Wednesday, released on the dawn of the hopeful postwar years, rips into the domesticated Everyman (personified by ex-Everyman Harold Lloyd), with a scene involving Edgar Kennedy and a nearly-empty tavern that might be the most infectiously riotous single scene in American film history. Unfaithfully Yours is a black exploration of marital jealousy as it's jacked up into homicidal sadism. Each of them is, at first blush, as bubbly as a six-pack of canned champagne. </p> <p>Pros like Stanwyck, Fonda, McCrea and Claudette Colbert, in The Palm Beach Story, never again had lines and scenes that crisp and delicious; and the mind boggles to imagine what Cary Grant or Carole Lombard might've done with a Sturges script in their teeth. </p> <p>But Sturges obviously preferred character actors to stars, and often his films are completely overrun with eccentric crackpots. Before it became fashionable, Sturges stuck mostly with his own troupe of wacky talent - Bracken, Kennedy, Rudy Vallee, the dazzling William Demarest, Jimmy Conlin, Franklin Pangborn, Torben Meyer, etc. And Sturges' greatest achievement may have been the thick and astonishing madness that he so often whipped this busy team into, as the members of the unforgettable Ale &amp; Quail Club in The Palm Beach Story, as the cloud of Hollywood yea-sayers and servants buzzing around Sullivan in Sullivan's Travels, and, best of all, as the irrepressible denizens of Smalltown USA providing the real action in Morgan's Creek and Conquering Hero. </p> <p>Because Sturges did nearly everything on his films himself, his obsessions and beliefs are right there, locked into every scene: the troubling conviction that in America you are essentially what others think you are, the blithe disrespect for old-money aristocracy, the notion that Middle America harbours the lunatic kinks and warped perspective of an in-bred mountain family, the genuinely warming regard for the whole unholy shebang. But none of it would mean anything if it weren't funny, and funny is what Sturges knew like a kid knows his own treehouse. You could quote individual lines for the rest of your life, but the films are more than mere cleverness, they're funny with a fearsome momentum that always threatens to overwhelm you just when you are instead instinctively waiting for the lull that Sturges left out. </p> <p>Eventually stymied and presumably hamstrung by poor box-office, Sturges couldn't keep his motor running in fifth gear forever, and by the end of the 40s, he was through - he'd direct only one more woeful film, 1956's The Diary of Major Thompson, and write a few more. Whatever conclusions may be reached from this are for others to worry about; sometimes, talented careers just end, and we should give thanks that at least when Sturges blazed, he blazed brightly. For the Kockenlockers and Ratskywatskys of the world, he will never be forgotten.</p> <p>\u0095 A season of Preston Sturges films runs at London's NFT from May 12-25 (Box office: 020-7928 3232).

      "body": "<p>Here's some good news. One of the last century's greatest woman writers is finally getting her due, one of our best woman theatre directors has made her first feature film, an Irish novelist of brilliant originality has written a fascinating screenplay, and a difficult and often overlooked corner of history is being re-illumined. </p> <p>All this comes together in a remarkable new film, The Last September, based on the novel by Elizabeth Bowen. The film is directed by Deborah Warner, the screenplay is by John Banville, the cinematographer is Slawomir Idziak (of Kieslowski's Three Colours: Blue), one of the executive producers is Neil Jordan, and the cast includes Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Fiona Shaw, Jane Birkin and Keeley Hawes. </p> <p>Bowen (probably best known for The Death of the Heart and The Heat of the Day, her haunting novels of bad faith and betrayal of the 30s and 40s) published The Last September in 1929. Her Anglo-Irish childhood was divided between Dublin, England and her family home, Bowen's Court, in the corner of north-east County Cork, where The Last September is set.</p> <p>She had been a restless teenager in the years of the Great War, the Troubles (the war of independence between the British soldiers, the notorious \"Black and Tans\" and the Irish revolutionaries) and the subsequent Irish civil war. By the time houses near Bowen's Court were being burned down in 1921, she was a 22-year-old starting a literary career in London, and her relationship to Ireland, where she kept her family house until it was sold (and then demolished) in 1959, was always part-time.</p> <p>The Last September, her second and favourite novel, looked back with a mixture of nostalgia and irony on the peculiar tribe she grew up in. The Anglo-Irish landowners, or \"Protestant Ascendancy\" hanging on to a past of colonial supremacy in violently changing times, found themselves, in the period of the Troubles, ineffectually caught between their inherited loyalty to the British and (as Bowen puts it) their own \"temperamental Irishness\". </p> <p>They had to watch their own or their neighbours' houses burned as symbols of oppression, and to see the tenants and locals they had known all their lives at war with English soldiers who were their tennis partners. Loss of power, and loss of what Bowen calls the idea of \"civilisation\" which lay behind the establishment of their great demesnes in the 18th century, had gone along with increasing isolation in, and rejection by, the country they thought of as theirs. </p> <p>Like Chekhov's plays about the dying years of Russian feudalism, The Last September captures the silliness, the snobbery, the perfect manners, the determination not to show their feelings, the denial, and the ending of the way of life of Bowen's circle. \"Will there ever be anything we can all do except not notice?\" one of them asks. Having prided themselves on continuity, rootedness, and a life symbolically centred on the Big House, they have come to feel like unreal transients. </p> <p>The heroine of this novel is the 19-year-old orphaned Lois Farquar, living with her uncle and his wife, the Naylors, in Danielstown in County Cork. Visitors arrive, tennis is played, there are tea-parties, dances and love affairs. A glamorous Anglo-Irish visitor from London, Marda Norton, breaks hearts and creates disorder, before leaving to marry a rich Englishman. Lois, self-conscious and restless and dying for some action, gets half-heartedly engaged to Gerald, a decent British soldier. </p> <p>The scheming Lady Naylor tries to put a stop to the romance. (\"He seems to have no relations. One cannot trace him. His mother, he says, lives in Surrey, and, of course, you do know, don't you, what Surrey is?\") Outside this mannered, slow-paced, habitual life, the Troubles are closing in. On the edge of the demesne, there is gun-smuggling, barracks are burned, troops are fired on, a local is arrested. At the end, Gerald is killed, Lois goes away, and Danielstown (a central character in the book) is burned down. </p> <p>Fiona Shaw, who grew up in Cork, and plays Marda, recognised this \"tribe\" at once when she read The Last September. Shaw thinks Bowen gets exactly the feeling of that Irish life and landscape: the \"Russian malaise,\" the meals, the long tea-parties, the dark green colours, the trees closing in, above all the damp. \"I know those long, damp summers, neither sunny enough to be exotic nor damp enough to be wintry.\" She also knows plenty of families whose house is the main character in their lives. \"One woman I know goes to Cork shopping, but she has to be back after four hours - she misses the house.\" </p> <p>Shaw recognises Bowen's ambivalence, too. She has many Irish friends who, like her, live in England but never feel quite at home, are torn and divided and constantly going back. She can just imagine what Marda's life in England would be, trading on her past by saying \"Of course, I'm Irish\" and arranging the flowers more eccentrically than anyone else, giving long teas and longing for people to drop in. She recognises the strange mix in Marda's personality, \"somebody who wills herself to be as shallow as a jelly at a tea-party and yet cannot help noticing things.\" </p> <p>She is capable of ruthlessness, too, and of being \"inadvertently dangerous\" to Lois, the young woman she befriends. But what Bowen has captured most brilliantly about these people, Shaw thinks, is that they are all \"trying to do nothing, and things happen to them\". Meanwhile, they keep smiling, like Winnie in Beckett's Happy Days, buried up to her neck in sand and still saying: \"It will have been another happy day!\" </p> <p>If the actress approached The Last September through its sense of character, the director was drawn to it for its powerful visual atmosphere. Deborah Warner had read no Bowen when Neil Jordan gave her an early draft of Banville's screenplay. When she read the novel, it seemed to her \"a book that needed to be a film\". Warner feels that if Bowen had not been a novelist, she might have been a film-maker: \"I'd never read a novel that dealt so brilliantly with light.\" Bowen looks \"like a hawk\", everything in the novel is intensely seen, \"right up close\". That's what has inspired Warner. </p> <p>The film is flooded with that intense rich colour palette, attentive pauses on small things, scenes glimpsed and spied on. Warner wanted thousands of tiny details, and colours that would look like no other film set in Ireland. It delighted her to discover that when Bowen went on Desert Island Discs, her luxury was a kaleidoscope. Warner worked for six months very closely with Banville on the script. He, too, was introduced to the novel by Jordan, and thinks it \"superb\". And he has great tenderness for the Anglo-Irish, as well as seeing clearly (as did Bowen's cousin, the writer Hubert Butler, whom Banville knew) that they were to blame, after the civil war, for shutting the gates of their demesnes instead of participating actively in the new Ireland. </p> <p>Yet, he says, \"you can't help admiring them. I would love to have been Anglo-Irish. Who wouldn't have wanted to be Elizabeth Bowen? For all her misfortunes, it was a wonderful life.

      "bodyText": "Here's some good news. One of the last century's greatest woman writers is finally getting her due, one of our best woman theatre directors has made her first feature film, an Irish novelist of brilliant originality has written a fascinating screenplay, and a difficult and often overlooked corner of history is being re-illumined. All this comes together in a remarkable new film, The Last September, based on the novel by Elizabeth Bowen. The film is directed by Deborah Warner, the screenplay is by John Banville, the cinematographer is Slawomir Idziak (of Kieslowski's Three Colours: Blue), one of the executive producers is Neil Jordan, and the cast includes Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Fiona Shaw, Jane Birkin and Keeley Hawes. Bowen (probably best known for The Death of the Heart and The Heat of the Day, her haunting novels of bad faith and betrayal of the 30s and 40s) published The Last September in 1929. Her Anglo-Irish childhood was divided between Dublin, England and her family home, Bowen's Court, in the corner of north-east County Cork, where The Last September is set. She had been a restless teenager in the years of the Great War, the Troubles (the war of independence between the British soldiers, the notorious \"Black and Tans\" and the Irish revolutionaries) and the subsequent Irish civil war. By the time houses near Bowen's Court were being burned down in 1921, she was a 22-year-old starting a literary career in London, and her relationship to Ireland, where she kept her family house until it was sold (and then demolished) in 1959, was always part-time. The Last September, her second and favourite novel, looked back with a mixture of nostalgia and irony on the peculiar tribe she grew up in. The Anglo-Irish landowners, or \"Protestant Ascendancy\" hanging on to a past of colonial supremacy in violently changing times, found themselves, in the period of the Troubles, ineffectually caught between their inherited loyalty to the British and (as Bowen puts it) their own \"temperamental Irishness\". They had to watch their own or their neighbours' houses burned as symbols of oppression, and to see the tenants and locals they had known all their lives at war with English soldiers who were their tennis partners. Loss of power, and loss of what Bowen calls the idea of \"civilisation\" which lay behind the establishment of their great demesnes in the 18th century, had gone along with increasing isolation in, and rejection by, the country they thought of as theirs. Like Chekhov's plays about the dying years of Russian feudalism, The Last September captures the silliness, the snobbery, the perfect manners, the determination not to show their feelings, the denial, and the ending of the way of life of Bowen's circle. \"Will there ever be anything we can all do except not notice?\" one of them asks. Having prided themselves on continuity, rootedness, and a life symbolically centred on the Big House, they have come to feel like unreal transients. The heroine of this novel is the 19-year-old orphaned Lois Farquar, living with her uncle and his wife, the Naylors, in Danielstown in County Cork. Visitors arrive, tennis is played, there are tea-parties, dances and love affairs. A glamorous Anglo-Irish visitor from London, Marda Norton, breaks hearts and creates disorder, before leaving to marry a rich Englishman. Lois, self-conscious and restless and dying for some action, gets half-heartedly engaged to Gerald, a decent British soldier. The scheming Lady Naylor tries to put a stop to the romance. (\"He seems to have no relations. One cannot trace him. His mother, he says, lives in Surrey, and, of course, you do know, don't you, what Surrey is?\") Outside this mannered, slow-paced, habitual life, the Troubles are closing in. On the edge of the demesne, there is gun-smuggling, barracks are burned, troops are fired on, a local is arrested. At the end, Gerald is killed, Lois goes away, and Danielstown (a central character in the book) is burned down. Fiona Shaw, who grew up in Cork, and plays Marda, recognised this \"tribe\" at once when she read The Last September. Shaw thinks Bowen gets exactly the feeling of that Irish life and landscape: the \"Russian malaise,\" the meals, the long tea-parties, the dark green colours, the trees closing in, above all the damp. \"I know those long, damp summers, neither sunny enough to be exotic nor damp enough to be wintry.\" She also knows plenty of families whose house is the main character in their lives. \"One woman I know goes to Cork shopping, but she has to be back after four hours - she misses the house.\" Shaw recognises Bowen's ambivalence, too. She has many Irish friends who, like her, live in England but never feel quite at home, are torn and divided and constantly going back. She can just imagine what Marda's life in England would be, trading on her past by saying \"Of course, I'm Irish\" and arranging the flowers more eccentrically than anyone else, giving long teas and longing for people to drop in. She recognises the strange mix in Marda's personality, \"somebody who wills herself to be as shallow as a jelly at a tea-party and yet cannot help noticing things.\" She is capable of ruthlessness, too, and of being \"inadvertently dangerous\" to Lois, the young woman she befriends. But what Bowen has captured most brilliantly about these people, Shaw thinks, is that they are all \"trying to do nothing, and things happen to them\". Meanwhile, they keep smiling, like Winnie in Beckett's Happy Days, buried up to her neck in sand and still saying: \"It will have been another happy day!\" If the actress approached The Last September through its sense of character, the director was drawn to it for its powerful visual atmosphere. Deborah Warner had read no Bowen when Neil Jordan gave her an early draft of Banville's screenplay. When she read the novel, it seemed to her \"a book that needed to be a film\". Warner feels that if Bowen had not been a novelist, she might have been a film-maker: \"I'd never read a novel that dealt so brilliantly with light.\" Bowen looks \"like a hawk\", everything in the novel is intensely seen, \"right up close\". That's what has inspired Warner. The film is flooded with that intense rich colour palette, attentive pauses on small things, scenes glimpsed and spied on. Warner wanted thousands of tiny details, and colours that would look like no other film set in Ireland. It delighted her to discover that when Bowen went on Desert Island Discs, her luxury was a kaleidoscope. Warner worked for six months very closely with Banville on the script. He, too, was introduced to the novel by Jordan, and thinks it \"superb\". And he has great tenderness for the Anglo-Irish, as well as seeing clearly (as did Bowen's cousin, the writer Hubert Butler, whom Banville knew) that they were to blame, after the civil war, for shutting the gates of their demesnes instead of participating actively in the new Ireland. Yet, he says, \"you can't help admiring them. I would love to have been Anglo-Irish. Who wouldn't have wanted to be Elizabeth Bowen? For all her misfortunes, it was a wonderful life. When we were growing up, we used to see them at church fetes, and it was like going to Mars. They were shabby, but they had such style and character. No one can wear an old cardigan like an Anglo-Irish lady\". Warner spent a long time on the casting, looking for exactly the right qualities for these shabby-grand Anglo-Irish characters. (\"They all needed to be very big people, very tall, like Bowen.\") They rehearsed for a week, before filming started, in an old house in County Meath, and began to live together like a family.

A little of the unreadably deadpan in that remark - and something of its flourish - is detectable in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Jarmusch's arresting new serio-comedy about a professional killer, Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker), who lives alone in a rickety loft, and communicates with his single employer, a wheezing Mafia hood, by means of the carrier pigeons he keeps. </p> <p>Always, he devoutly follows the way of the samurai warrior. In between tuning up his weaponry and slouching with Antarctic cool around the tough city streets, Ghost Dog studies an ancient samurai text in his ascetic lair, and its lessons and saws are periodically flashed up on the screen as captions. </p> <p>It is a movie with Jarmusch's intriguing unlocatability of tone. Forest Whitaker's Ghost Dog is glacially, massively serious in everything he does and says. As he unsmilingly pads the sidewalk with a mean rolling gait - head, neck and spinal column perfectly straight while each shoulder rocks up in turn almost touching the side of his face - Ghost Dog gets respect from everyone on the street, underscored by a soundtrack from RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. </p> <p>And yet this gangsta poise coexists with a weirdly playful quality. Unlike Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Samourai or John Sturges's The Magnificent Seven, something distinctly whimsical is at work in this grafting of Eastern martial codes on to the gun-for-hire culture of the United States. After Ghost Dog takes someone out, it is his custom to wave his gun-plus-silencer around in the air, describing the circular figures an ancient samurai might have done, before returning it to his scabbard. </p> <p>One of his few friends is French-speaking ice-cream salesman Raymond, likeably played by Jarmusch regular Isaach de Bankol\u00e9 - and Ghost Dog doesn't speak any French. His only other friend is Pearline (the precocious Camille Winbush), a little girl who inaugurates a little reading club with him, with Ghost Dog in the Oprah role, discussing literature on a park bench: Rashomon, Frankenstein, The Wind in the Willows. The effect is comic and a little absurd, and the movie is almost daring us to laugh at, or maybe with, Ghost Dog and the eccentric belief system he has constructed for himself. </p> <p>It all creates for this film a taste which has to be rolled around the mouth for a little while to see if you like it and, in terms of type, it is pretty well sui generis . But the effect Jarmusch achieves is so enjoyable and distinctive, and it shows something individually and engagingly developed in its approach to cinema gangland - something which our dire Britpack, with its callow, saucer-eyed reverence for gangsters, could study. </p> <p>The chief complexity, or maybe the chief implausibility, of the film is the relationship of the black hero, Ghost Dog, to the white Italian-American who is employer or \"retainer\". Ghost Dog is supposed to have formed this romantic loyalty - albeit one he is well paid for - when Louie (John Tormey) stops Dog from being beaten up by some white guys in an alley. Ghost Dog evidently thinks it no dishonour to be the bonded servant of Louie and the Italian wise guys who are his ultimate masters: a trio of crackling performances from Cliff Gorman as Sonny Valerio, Henry Silva as Vargo, and Gene Ruffini as an Old Consigliere. No explicit comment about the racial politics of his situation passes Ghost Dog's lips, but Ruffini's Consigliere, a man given to strange Tourette-squawks, jeers that he is \"just another nigger\". </p> <p>Ghost Dog effectively reclaims his self- respect - if that is, in fact, what he has lost - when the mafiosi turn on him, and he has to take them out with his usual inscrutable self-possession. But not before Jarmusch has established a kind of rapprochement between their two cultures and codes of honour. They are, says Ghost Dog, like two ancient tribes, who in this film come to accord each other, if not exactly friendship, a kind of wary recognition. Sonny muses that \"all these black guys\" give themselves street names like Ghost Dog, and that's like the \"Indians\" who call themselves Red Cloud or Running Bear - or, as it ironically turns out, like mafiosi who call themselves things like Sammy the Snake. And Sonny himself turns out to have a bit of a penchant for Flavor Flav of Public Enemy. </p> <p>In Summer of Sam, Spike Lee stepped back and made the white wise guys the heroes of a classic New York story; for his part, Jarmusch envisions a kind of guarded respect between the black and Italian tough guys of urban and celluloid history. But always with this strange element of comic deflection: a sense that at least some of the fable of Ghost Dog is tongue-in-cheek. Some may find this mixture of genre and tone thin or unsatisfying; I found it increasingly beguiling - it really grows on you. Jarmusch finds in the brutal world of the professional killer not merely black comedy but sadness and his own strand of wistful poetry.</p>",
