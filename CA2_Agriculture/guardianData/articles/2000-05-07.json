He played a delivery from Bryan Strang on to his stumps attempting to drive him through the offside. </p> <p>On a superb batting strip, Johnson hit 14 boundaries and a huge six off Michael Yardy in his attractive 134-ball innings. His fine opening stand with Flower ended when Flower, attempting a single off James Kirtley, was brilliantly run out for 53 by a direct hit to the striker's end from Adams at backward point. </p> <p>Johnson was given further excellent support in the sunshine by Goodwin who had made 63, including eight fours and a six over mid-wicket at Robin Martin-Jenkins' expense, when he skied a catch to Adams at short square-leg from a top edge off Yardy. The former captain Alistair Campbell then joined Johnson to see Zimbabwe home in untroubled fashion. </p> <p>Sussex earlier made 264 for four after choosing to bat. The former Northamptonshire opener Montgomerie struck 11 fours and a six off 154 balls and his partnership with Cottey took just 34 overs. </p> <p>After Adams had gone in the fourth over of the day, Montgomerie and Cottey batted with confidence as Zimbabwe got through eight bowlers. Cottey had hit eight fours in his attractive 102-ball innings when he was trapped leg-before sweeping at the medium pace of Goodwin. </p> <p>Montgomerie's century took 124 balls and he added 38 for the third wicket with Umer Rashid before the latter was run out for 11.

His fine opening stand with Flower ended when Flower, attempting a single off James Kirtley, was brilliantly run out for 53 by a direct hit to the striker's end from Adams at backward point. Johnson was given further excellent support in the sunshine by Goodwin who had made 63, including eight fours and a six over mid-wicket at Robin Martin-Jenkins' expense, when he skied a catch to Adams at short square-leg from a top edge off Yardy. The former captain Alistair Campbell then joined Johnson to see Zimbabwe home in untroubled fashion. Sussex earlier made 264 for four after choosing to bat. The former Northamptonshire opener Montgomerie struck 11 fours and a six off 154 balls and his partnership with Cottey took just 34 overs. After Adams had gone in the fourth over of the day, Montgomerie and Cottey batted with confidence as Zimbabwe got through eight bowlers. Cottey had hit eight fours in his attractive 102-ball innings when he was trapped leg-before sweeping at the medium pace of Goodwin. Montgomerie's century took 124 balls and he added 38 for the third wicket with Umer Rashid before the latter was run out for 11. Rashid failed to make his ground after Montgomerie refused a single after pushing a delivery from Goodwin into the covers.",

      "body": "<p>It is becoming all too easy to forget just how much progress Liverpool have made this season for they have lost the plot to such dramatic effect that they seemingly have little interest in penning the final chapter. </p> <p>After their fourth game without a goal, the Champions League place which seemed theirs for the taking now represents nothing more tangible than a waking dream. </p> <p>They sit third in the Premiership table this morning but if Leeds United should defeat Everton at Elland Road this evening they will probably have to settle for a place in the Uefa Cup. </p> <p>At the end the leaden-footed Reds trudged away towards the dressing room, the manager G\u00e9rard Houllier shaking each of them warmly by the hand. They have done exceptionally well, exceeding all expectations, but, as the Frenchman knows, the tank is now dry, the batteries drained. </p> <p>\"There is no funeral here at all,\" he said. \"What we must remember is that we have qualified for Europe; last season we finished with nothing at all. Even if Leeds United do win against Everton we will still be chasing a place in the Champions League next weekend.\" </p> <p>Two successive defeats is more than Houllier can bear and so, in the traditional manner, the axe was swung. Discarded were the out-of-touch Dietmar Hamann, the often clumsy David Thompson and the exhausted Michael Owen. \"He had played five games in 25 days,\" Houllier said, \"and considering the problems he has had it was a sound decision to give him a rest.\" </p> <p>The most celebrated of the returnees was Robbie Fowler, free of ankle trouble and able to start a senior fixture for the first time since last September. With a forward of his predatory instinct in the side it is incumbent upon team-mates to present him with the ball in advantageous positions. This Liverpool neglected to do and just before the hour the crestfallen Fowler was substituted. </p> <p>He had wandered around like a lost soul on the periphery of the action while all the chances of any note were squandered by the other striker to win promotion from the bench. </p> <p>Titi Camara sprints forward like a gazelle but then, as the frame of the goal comes into focus, he shoots irrespective of distance, irrespective of angle. He can be magical, he can be almost comical but only rarely does he occupy the middle ground. </p> <p>In a first half which only rarely raised itself to an acceptable level Southampton always seemed the more likely to score, and they would have done had Liverpool's goalkeeper Sander Westerveld not produced a quite remarkable save to turn aside Jo Tessem's header after 30 minutes. </p> <p>Indeed Westerveld was to rescue his colleagues on several occasions, particularly in the second period when Liverpool's desperation was at its most pronounced. Their football disintegrated as, fittingly, the early-afternoon sunshine was replaced by ominous grey clouds. </p> <p>With too many players swift to delegate responsibility there was no cohesion, no hint of fluency and no penetration. It was painful to watch. </p> <p>Liverpool will toss the dice for one last time against Bradford City next Sunday. You really would not put a bean on them winning at Valley Parade, an alarming prospect for Houllier, for Liverpool's bankers and, of course, for Wimbledon. </p>",

      "bodyText": "It is becoming all too easy to forget just how much progress Liverpool have made this season for they have lost the plot to such dramatic effect that they seemingly have little interest in penning the final chapter. After their fourth game without a goal, the Champions League place which seemed theirs for the taking now represents nothing more tangible than a waking dream. They sit third in the Premiership table this morning but if Leeds United should defeat Everton at Elland Road this evening they will probably have to settle for a place in the Uefa Cup. At the end the leaden-footed Reds trudged away towards the dressing room, the manager G\u00e9rard Houllier shaking each of them warmly by the hand. They have done exceptionally well, exceeding all expectations, but, as the Frenchman knows, the tank is now dry, the batteries drained. \"There is no funeral here at all,\" he said. \"What we must remember is that we have qualified for Europe; last season we finished with nothing at all. Even if Leeds United do win against Everton we will still be chasing a place in the Champions League next weekend.\" Two successive defeats is more than Houllier can bear and so, in the traditional manner, the axe was swung. Discarded were the out-of-touch Dietmar Hamann, the often clumsy David Thompson and the exhausted Michael Owen. \"He had played five games in 25 days,\" Houllier said, \"and considering the problems he has had it was a sound decision to give him a rest.\" The most celebrated of the returnees was Robbie Fowler, free of ankle trouble and able to start a senior fixture for the first time since last September. With a forward of his predatory instinct in the side it is incumbent upon team-mates to present him with the ball in advantageous positions. This Liverpool neglected to do and just before the hour the crestfallen Fowler was substituted. He had wandered around like a lost soul on the periphery of the action while all the chances of any note were squandered by the other striker to win promotion from the bench. Titi Camara sprints forward like a gazelle but then, as the frame of the goal comes into focus, he shoots irrespective of distance, irrespective of angle. He can be magical, he can be almost comical but only rarely does he occupy the middle ground. In a first half which only rarely raised itself to an acceptable level Southampton always seemed the more likely to score, and they would have done had Liverpool's goalkeeper Sander Westerveld not produced a quite remarkable save to turn aside Jo Tessem's header after 30 minutes. Indeed Westerveld was to rescue his colleagues on several occasions, particularly in the second period when Liverpool's desperation was at its most pronounced. Their football disintegrated as, fittingly, the early-afternoon sunshine was replaced by ominous grey clouds. With too many players swift to delegate responsibility there was no cohesion, no hint of fluency and no penetration. It was painful to watch. Liverpool will toss the dice for one last time against Bradford City next Sunday. You really would not put a bean on them winning at Valley Parade, an alarming prospect for Houllier, for Liverpool's bankers and, of course, for Wimbledon.",

Saturday's elegant win over Chelsea here was their eighth successive Premiership victory, form which, had it been found earlier, would at the least have delayed Manchester United's celebrations. </p> <p>Arsenal blew their chances over Christmas and the New Year. Subsequent defeats by Liverpool and Middlesbrough ensured Highbury would remain title-free for another season. It is assumed that this still matters. If, however, the Premiership is seen as merely a pre-qualifier for the Champions League then Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team have more or less achieved their season's aims. </p> <p>A point from tomorrow night's home game against moribund Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal will again join United in the Champions League. They could then concentrate on a silver collection which would see the Uefa Cup at Highbury, provided they beat Galatasaray in Copenhagen on Wednesday week. </p> <p>It all smacks of second options - Arsenal are only in the Uefa Cup because they failed to hack it in the Champions League - but at least Wenger is in a happier situation than Gianluca Vialli, for whom this defeat ended Chelsea's hopes of gaining a Uefa Cup place via the Premiership. They can still achieve this by winning the FA Cup, otherwise Chelsea's only chance in Europe next season will be the Intertoto Cup. It is difficult to imagine Vialli's French contingent being agog at the prospect. </p> <p>Too often at Highbury Vialli's players were a bad second to 50-50 balls. In midfield Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit almost totally dominated the persevering Dennis Wise and Jody Morris and Chelsea only established some sort of parity once Gustavo Poyet had come on and Petit gone off. </p> <p>Vialli's use of Poyet, who at one time seemed to have established himself as his team's talisman, is a mystery. Two astutely taken goals by the Uruguayan took Chelsea to the FA Cup final in the face of an excellent recovery by Newcastle United and here another, taken with typical aplomb when he chested down Emerson Thome's cross before beating David Seaman, put Arsenal's victory briefly in doubt. </p> <p>Poyet replaced Gianfranco Zola, who had given another performance of tireless dexterity, for the last half-hour. If both are not in Vialli's starting line-up against Aston Villa at Wembley then theory will have upstaged common sense. On Saturday it was bad enough seeing Tore Andre Flo, Chelsea's top scorer, confined to the left wing for the first half. </p> <p>Vialli explained that he had meant the Norwegian to be a link between the midfield and the two up front, Zola and George Weah, but \"unfortunately we forgot about [him]\". Once Flo had been moved to the middle and supported by Poyet's quick, accurate passes Chelsea looked a force again, but it was too late. </p> <p>Arsenal won the match simply enough with two goals from Thierry Henry, who took his season's total to 25. The first punished a hash of a headed interception by Frank Leboeuf. Henry waited for Ed de Goey to commit himself before scoring from a narrow angle. </p> <p>His second was notable for the way that, having gathered Dennis Bergkamp's pass, the striker muscled his way past Marcel Desailly before scoring from another awkward position. </p> <p>Vialli excused Chelsea's generally vapid performance on the ground that the day was unexpectedly hot, never a wise plea when your attack is led by a Liberian. </p>",

If, however, the Premiership is seen as merely a pre-qualifier for the Champions League then Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team have more or less achieved their season's aims. A point from tomorrow night's home game against moribund Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal will again join United in the Champions League. They could then concentrate on a silver collection which would see the Uefa Cup at Highbury, provided they beat Galatasaray in Copenhagen on Wednesday week. It all smacks of second options - Arsenal are only in the Uefa Cup because they failed to hack it in the Champions League - but at least Wenger is in a happier situation than Gianluca Vialli, for whom this defeat ended Chelsea's hopes of gaining a Uefa Cup place via the Premiership. They can still achieve this by winning the FA Cup, otherwise Chelsea's only chance in Europe next season will be the Intertoto Cup. It is difficult to imagine Vialli's French contingent being agog at the prospect. Too often at Highbury Vialli's players were a bad second to 50-50 balls. In midfield Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit almost totally dominated the persevering Dennis Wise and Jody Morris and Chelsea only established some sort of parity once Gustavo Poyet had come on and Petit gone off. Vialli's use of Poyet, who at one time seemed to have established himself as his team's talisman, is a mystery. Two astutely taken goals by the Uruguayan took Chelsea to the FA Cup final in the face of an excellent recovery by Newcastle United and here another, taken with typical aplomb when he chested down Emerson Thome's cross before beating David Seaman, put Arsenal's victory briefly in doubt. Poyet replaced Gianfranco Zola, who had given another performance of tireless dexterity, for the last half-hour. If both are not in Vialli's starting line-up against Aston Villa at Wembley then theory will have upstaged common sense. On Saturday it was bad enough seeing Tore Andre Flo, Chelsea's top scorer, confined to the left wing for the first half. Vialli explained that he had meant the Norwegian to be a link between the midfield and the two up front, Zola and George Weah, but \"unfortunately we forgot about [him]\". Once Flo had been moved to the middle and supported by Poyet's quick, accurate passes Chelsea looked a force again, but it was too late. Arsenal won the match simply enough with two goals from Thierry Henry, who took his season's total to 25. The first punished a hash of a headed interception by Frank Leboeuf. Henry waited for Ed de Goey to commit himself before scoring from a narrow angle. His second was notable for the way that, having gathered Dennis Bergkamp's pass, the striker muscled his way past Marcel Desailly before scoring from another awkward position. Vialli excused Chelsea's generally vapid performance on the ground that the day was unexpectedly hot, never a wise plea when your attack is led by a Liberian.",

Clearly the prospect of renewing hostilities with Manchester United had long since occurred to the City supporters celebrating loud and long after this victory.

Blackburn really gave us the run-around for 45 or 50 minutes.\" </p> <p>True enough. Indeed there were times in the first half when Rovers, relegated last season, appeared worth rather more than a mid-table position. Time and again the precocious skills of Matt Jansen, combined with Ashley Ward's industry and the consistent width given to Blackburn's movements by Jason McAteer and Damien Duff, caught the City defence square and spreadeagled. All this achieved, however, was one goal accompanied by a regular tattoo on City's wooden bits. Shortly before the half-hour Marlon Broomes met David Dunn's cross with a header against the bar. Shortly afterwards Dunn let fly from 20 yards with a similar result. </p> <p>In the 42nd minute Ward took two City defenders with him as he moved for a throw from Simon Grayson on the right. The ball clipped one of them, Spencer Prior, before bouncing high to Jansen, who chested it down deftly and drove a smart, left-foot shot inside the right-hand post. </p> <p>This was a logical development considering the prevailing pattern of the game and when, early in the second half, Duff's close control turned City on the left before Ward cut inside Richard Edghill to send a shot against the right-hand angle, Blackburn appeared to be carrying on where they had left off. Less than a minute later Jansen turned beautifully under pressure before striking the right-hand post, but there Rovers' domination ended. </p> <p>On the hour their defence failed to cut out a quick, early cross from Kevin Horlock and Goater, previously anonymous, popped up at the far post to drive in his 29th goal of the season. </p> <p>Five minutes later Christian Dailly's attempt to nod a high ball from Richard Edghill back to his goalkeeper Alan Kelly, who was already advancing towards it, produced one of the season's more significant own-goals. </p> <p>Mark Kennedy and Dickov scored opportunistically in the 74th and 79th minutes to send City fans inside and outside Ewood Park into fresh raptures, and the rest was all congas and champagne corks. </p> <p>\"What happened to us in the last half-hour was totally unacceptable,\" said Graeme Souness, the Blackburn manager, darkly. \"Today you saw the best and worst of Blackburn Rovers.\" As much went for Manchester City - but at least they got the order right.</p>",

Treasury sources said the chancellor has asked Mr Myners to investigate whether the City is governed by \"systematic herd behaviour\" to the detriment of growing businesses and manufacturing. The study will look at how pension fund trustees are chosen, how expert they are, what incentives they have, and what sort of information pension fund members and life insurance policy holders have about how their money is invested. Mr Brown also wants an investigation into the role of highly influential pension fund consultants, who advise pension fund trustees about their investment decisions. The government fears that inexperienced trustees are often pushed into making decisions by a small number of firms of actuaries. In the wake of news in the Budget that Mr Myners had been asked to tackle the subject, Mr Brown will use a lecture tonight to launch a strong attack on the City's failure to invest in Britain's struggling manufacturing sector. After a decade in which Labour has courted financiers in an attempt to show that it no longer poses a threat to the City, the chancellor will say that the government must ensure that \"there are no unnecessary constraints restricting investment decisions\" and that investors \"have every opportunity and encouragement to back dynamic small and growing companies in manufacturing and services in all our regions.\" Treasury sources said that the government did not intend to tell investors how to do their jobs, but stressed that the government wanted a root and branch inquiry into the barriers preventing small and growing companies from attracting funds from the City. \"We believe that the City should serve the interests of the wider economy and those interests are not being served.

      "body": "<p>\"I love the House of Commons - after 14 years I still get a real buzz out of working here,\" says Lucy Watson. Working from an office in the shadow of Westminster Abbey, Watson, 32, is the pension unit manager of the House of Commons finance and administration department, responsible for administering payments to almost everyone who works there, from part-time cleaners to senior cabinet ministers. </p> <p>Despite having dropped out of A-levels at school, Watson's move to the corridors of power was a fairly rapid one. She worked for a year as a clerical assistant for the ministry of defence near her home in York, before moving to London at the age of 18. </p> <p>\"I applied for an administrative position in the House of Comons personnel department which, at that time, dealt with pensions. By 1996 I was running the MPs' pension scheme, although the staff scheme was someone else's responsibility. This unit was set up in 1998 to streamline the admin of the pension schemes and I was appointed to help initiate and then run it.\" </p> <p>The staff pension scheme is responsible for 1,400 House of Commons staff. \"The public know what MPs do, but few people appreciate how large an administration establishment is needed behind the scenes,\" says Watson. </p> <p>The parallel MPs' scheme covers 659 sitting Members as well as about two dozen government ministers in the House of Lords. The unit also deals with the 700 retired staff and 800 ex-MPs who draw pensions. In addition, 200 former members will be eligible when they reach pensionable age - they are entitled to a full pension whether they have served for one parliament or a lifetime. </p> <p>Part of keeping this information up to date is monitoring the obituary columns. \"Most former MPs get an obituary in the broadsheets and there are usually benefits payable to their families.

      "bodyText": "\"I love the House of Commons - after 14 years I still get a real buzz out of working here,\" says Lucy Watson. Working from an office in the shadow of Westminster Abbey, Watson, 32, is the pension unit manager of the House of Commons finance and administration department, responsible for administering payments to almost everyone who works there, from part-time cleaners to senior cabinet ministers. Despite having dropped out of A-levels at school, Watson's move to the corridors of power was a fairly rapid one. She worked for a year as a clerical assistant for the ministry of defence near her home in York, before moving to London at the age of 18. \"I applied for an administrative position in the House of Comons personnel department which, at that time, dealt with pensions. By 1996 I was running the MPs' pension scheme, although the staff scheme was someone else's responsibility. This unit was set up in 1998 to streamline the admin of the pension schemes and I was appointed to help initiate and then run it.\" The staff pension scheme is responsible for 1,400 House of Commons staff. \"The public know what MPs do, but few people appreciate how large an administration establishment is needed behind the scenes,\" says Watson. The parallel MPs' scheme covers 659 sitting Members as well as about two dozen government ministers in the House of Lords. The unit also deals with the 700 retired staff and 800 ex-MPs who draw pensions. In addition, 200 former members will be eligible when they reach pensionable age - they are entitled to a full pension whether they have served for one parliament or a lifetime. Part of keeping this information up to date is monitoring the obituary columns. \"Most former MPs get an obituary in the broadsheets and there are usually benefits payable to their families. But approaching the recently bereaved needs handling with great tact and sensitivity.\" Technically, she is not a civil servant. \"Constitutionally, the monarchy and parliament are separate institutions and civil servants work for the crown.

      "body": "<p>Take a close look at your colleagues. If they are eating, emailing, or emitting a high-pitched whine in the manner of a mosquito, they are likely to be suffering from a condition that affects more than half of all office support workers. We all like to complain of stress - the classic ailment of the 21st-century office worker - from time to time, occasionally suffering minor meltdowns when everything gets just too much. Now a Guardian survey has provided the most concrete evidence yet of the affect of stress on secretarial and office support staff - and the news isn't good. </p> <p>More than 15,000 of you responded to the Office Hours survey into workplace stress, and 52% said it was a major factor in your working life. The signs to watch out for include moaning to colleagues, compulsively snacking and indulging in personal use of the phone and email facilities. And the reason? Three main factors got most of the blame: quantity of work, difficult colleagues, and worries about a stress-filled future - beset with comfort-eating. </p> <p>They are probably problems that most workers can relate to. But what was surprising was the violence of feeling you demonstrated about stress in the workplace. While three-quarters of respondents have never shouted at their boss, taken up smoking or displayed the external signs of nervous breakdown, the survey asked you to share what you would really, really like to tell your boss given the chance - and some fairly ferocious demons were unleashed. \"I'd tell her to shut up, stop being a hypocrite, stop getting on everyone's nerves,\" runs a typically vitriolic response. \"Then I would punch her on the nose.\" </p> <p>One secretary dreamed of saying, \"Get stuffed you gutless little man\", another aspired to castrating her boss. \"Go on a diet,\" said another, while one hard-done-by secretary - a particular favourite, this - wanted to yell \"Do it yourself - and get a bath.\" There is presumably, some stress-busting value to these outbursts, but the vehemence with which they are expressed is a little alarming. There certainly seems to be some seething resentment bubbling under the businesslike air and polite telephone manner. </p> <p>Fantasy scenarios aside, angry gripes seem to be based on three main legitimate grievances. Unrealistic expectations, particularly concerning deadlines, are perceived to be the most provocative of management abuses. \"I would ask him to communicate better so I could leave my crystal ball at home,\" said one respondent, witheringly. \"I'd have him be me for a day so he can see how long things take, and that a five-minute deadline is not good enough,\" said another, along with the sweet reminder, \"I'm important too\". </p> <p>This sense of being under-appreciated was another common complaint, PAs sharing plaintive fantasies to \"tell him how I feel,\" hoping that the boss would \"involve me more and keep me informed,\" and \"say thank you.\" </p> <p>And, no surprise here, money is the final source of upset, with respondents finding a variety of creative ways, some involving minor assault, to demand a pay rise. A lot of respondents appeared to have spent time formulating scenes in which they verbally incinerated their seniors. \"I'd ask him if he has to practise to be so obnoxious or whether it just comes naturally,\" ran one insult that, one suspects, has been polished in front of the mirror in the ladies', but will never be used face-to-face. </p> <p>Everybody needs to let off steam, and those of you who replied to the survey probably felt a lot better having shared your true feelings, on paper at least. But there is an important hidden reason for all this outrage. Just under half believed themselves to be stuck in the wrong job: fretting, resentful and storing up unhappiness to unleash at home. Apart from compulsively emailing and wailing to colleagues, the stressed majority found their condition expressing itself most seriously away from the office. A quarter of those who replied believed their sex life had deteriorated since starting their job; a third said stress was having a detrimental effect on their relationship with their partner. More than half had suffered from insomnia. And yet, in spite of these hardships, almost two-thirds of respondents said they would be willing to take on more pressure for a salary increase. </p> <p>More pressure is not, of course, the same thing as more stress, and respondents were keen to differentiate between an environment so hard-boiled it damaged them (such as harassment and bullying) and one in which they were merely given a daunting amount of responsibility. As stress becomes more prevalent, so sufferers learn to lessen its impact by fitting it into a sliding scale of harmfulness, a self-preservation mechanism common in workplaces where stress permeates the atmosphere as much as the air-conditioning. The majority of respondents recognised a difference between healthy and damaging stress, between that which stimulated the adrenaline and enabled them to meet deadlines, and that which caused mental paralysis. </p> <p>Some industries are probably more difficult than others: \"There is still a culture in the legal profession that says if you aren't stressed, you're not working properly,\" says Barry Pritchard of Solcare, the legal healthcare charity. \"We've had calls from people who were certain they'd lost their jobs because they had complained about their workload.\" But like a rather pernicious virus, stress can infect even the most seemingly cosy of work environments. </p> <p>\"There are quite a lot of companies that still think stress is a wimp's issue,\" says Cary Cooper of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. This makes it particularly painful for male stress sufferers to seek help. If women are under a lot of pressure, they talk about it. That gives a release. Men are more likely to bottle it up, or turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as drinking.\" </p> <p>This is when stress becomes more than just something to be moaned about with your mates over a bottle of wine. In a recent survey conducted by ICM, workplace tensions were found to have caused one in eight men and one in ten women to shout at colleagues. Many also admitted to having broken down in tears as a result of problems at work. </p> <p>But the Office Hours survey found that while bosses were indirectly blamed for a stressful environment, the majority of respondents didn't think their jobs would be less stressful if they had a better relationship with their managers. It wasn't the stand-up fights and the tearful outbursts that caused stress, but the bitchy undercurrents that never made it to a confrontation and were thus never taken seriously. </p> <p>This is the heart of the matter. \"Employers treat stress very differently to other hazards,\" says Hugh Robertson, of the public services union Unison. \"We have to stop them thinking that there are two kinds of hazard - one that they have to do something about and one that they can ignore.\" Employers: take note. Ignoring your stressed out secretaries may be an occupational hazard. One day, they may decide to let you know how they really feel, and it won't be pretty.</p>",

But there is an important hidden reason for all this outrage. Just under half believed themselves to be stuck in the wrong job: fretting, resentful and storing up unhappiness to unleash at home. Apart from compulsively emailing and wailing to colleagues, the stressed majority found their condition expressing itself most seriously away from the office. A quarter of those who replied believed their sex life had deteriorated since starting their job; a third said stress was having a detrimental effect on their relationship with their partner. More than half had suffered from insomnia. And yet, in spite of these hardships, almost two-thirds of respondents said they would be willing to take on more pressure for a salary increase. More pressure is not, of course, the same thing as more stress, and respondents were keen to differentiate between an environment so hard-boiled it damaged them (such as harassment and bullying) and one in which they were merely given a daunting amount of responsibility. As stress becomes more prevalent, so sufferers learn to lessen its impact by fitting it into a sliding scale of harmfulness, a self-preservation mechanism common in workplaces where stress permeates the atmosphere as much as the air-conditioning. The majority of respondents recognised a difference between healthy and damaging stress, between that which stimulated the adrenaline and enabled them to meet deadlines, and that which caused mental paralysis. Some industries are probably more difficult than others: \"There is still a culture in the legal profession that says if you aren't stressed, you're not working properly,\" says Barry Pritchard of Solcare, the legal healthcare charity. \"We've had calls from people who were certain they'd lost their jobs because they had complained about their workload.\" But like a rather pernicious virus, stress can infect even the most seemingly cosy of work environments. \"There are quite a lot of companies that still think stress is a wimp's issue,\" says Cary Cooper of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. This makes it particularly painful for male stress sufferers to seek help. If women are under a lot of pressure, they talk about it. That gives a release. Men are more likely to bottle it up, or turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as drinking.\" This is when stress becomes more than just something to be moaned about with your mates over a bottle of wine. In a recent survey conducted by ICM, workplace tensions were found to have caused one in eight men and one in ten women to shout at colleagues. Many also admitted to having broken down in tears as a result of problems at work. But the Office Hours survey found that while bosses were indirectly blamed for a stressful environment, the majority of respondents didn't think their jobs would be less stressful if they had a better relationship with their managers. It wasn't the stand-up fights and the tearful outbursts that caused stress, but the bitchy undercurrents that never made it to a confrontation and were thus never taken seriously. This is the heart of the matter. \"Employers treat stress very differently to other hazards,\" says Hugh Robertson, of the public services union Unison. \"We have to stop them thinking that there are two kinds of hazard - one that they have to do something about and one that they can ignore.\" Employers: take note. Ignoring your stressed out secretaries may be an occupational hazard. One day, they may decide to let you know how they really feel, and it won't be pretty.",

      "byline": "Oliver Morgan",

      "body": "<p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Name:</strong> Dr Chai Patel </p> <p><strong> Age:</strong> 54 </p> <p><strong> Job:</strong> Chief executive, Westminster Healthcare </p> <p><strong> Other directorships:</strong> none </p> <p><strong> Hobbies:</strong> Golf (handicap 11), music, the arts, reading, painting, spectating at sports events </p> <p> 'Private health boss urges massive increase in business activity in NHS' is a headline to which even Margaret Thatcher would not have given credence. </p> <p>Even a year ago the whole notion would have been dismissed with a down-to-earth, 'Bugger off' from the Government's straight-talking old Labour Health Secretary, Frank Dobson. The idea that anyone making such an argument could actually be allowed to advise the Department of Health would have made his beard fall out. </p> <p>But now we have a clean-shaven New Labour Health Secretary, Alan Milburn, and a partnership between business and the NHS is under discussion. </p> <p>Dr Chai Patel, chief executive of Westminster Healthcare, the nursing home, diagnostic test provider and mental health group, is saying that the more companies such as his can do for the NHS, the better. And the Government is listening. </p> <p>Patel's opinion has extra authority in that he heads one of six 'action teams' advising on how to make the NHS work better. </p> <p>Last week one of his suggestions - that private nursing homes should be used to take the 20 per cent of people in badly needed NHS hospital beds who do not need to be there but are not well enough to go home - was endorsed by junior health Minister John Denham. </p> <p>Patel's view is that providing intermediate care, or recuperation between hospital and home, in a private sector nursing home is better for patients and more efficient than building extra hospital capacity in the NHS. </p> <p>But he would say that, wouldn't he - and surely there's a clear conflict of interest between his commercial and public roles? </p> <p>'Absolutely not,' says Patel. 'In long-term care, the private sector has been creating great change, innovating and expanding capacity. I don't see why we should not talk to the Government about health care in the same way as people talk to them about providing telecoms services.' </p> <p>Fighting talk. But Patel is no free market nutter. He wants profits, to be sure. But his ideas must be taken seriously. There is, he maintains, a clear distinction between allowing the private sector to provide services to NHS patients and the far more radical suggestion that private insurance should be expanded to displace NHS tax funding for healthcare. </p> <p>The virtue, as he sees it, is that the private sector can assess risks, raise capital, and provide services to the NHS on preferential terms, while operating assets commercially by allowing private access to them. </p> <p>In other words, he is just the kind of man to deliver Tony Blair's 'whatever works' vision. </p> <p>The son of Indian parents who came to Britain in 1969, Patel qualified as a doctor, but worked as a banker for Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers before founding nursing home group Court Cavendish in the Eighties. </p> <p>A year ago, with backing from Goldman Sachs, he took ailing Westminster Healthcare private for a total of \u00a3350 million.

      "bodyText": "Profile Name: Dr Chai Patel Age: 54 Job: Chief executive, Westminster Healthcare Other directorships: none Hobbies: Golf (handicap 11), music, the arts, reading, painting, spectating at sports events 'Private health boss urges massive increase in business activity in NHS' is a headline to which even Margaret Thatcher would not have given credence. Even a year ago the whole notion would have been dismissed with a down-to-earth, 'Bugger off' from the Government's straight-talking old Labour Health Secretary, Frank Dobson. The idea that anyone making such an argument could actually be allowed to advise the Department of Health would have made his beard fall out. But now we have a clean-shaven New Labour Health Secretary, Alan Milburn, and a partnership between business and the NHS is under discussion. Dr Chai Patel, chief executive of Westminster Healthcare, the nursing home, diagnostic test provider and mental health group, is saying that the more companies such as his can do for the NHS, the better. And the Government is listening. Patel's opinion has extra authority in that he heads one of six 'action teams' advising on how to make the NHS work better. Last week one of his suggestions - that private nursing homes should be used to take the 20 per cent of people in badly needed NHS hospital beds who do not need to be there but are not well enough to go home - was endorsed by junior health Minister John Denham. Patel's view is that providing intermediate care, or recuperation between hospital and home, in a private sector nursing home is better for patients and more efficient than building extra hospital capacity in the NHS. But he would say that, wouldn't he - and surely there's a clear conflict of interest between his commercial and public roles? 'Absolutely not,' says Patel. 'In long-term care, the private sector has been creating great change, innovating and expanding capacity. I don't see why we should not talk to the Government about health care in the same way as people talk to them about providing telecoms services.' Fighting talk. But Patel is no free market nutter. He wants profits, to be sure. But his ideas must be taken seriously. There is, he maintains, a clear distinction between allowing the private sector to provide services to NHS patients and the far more radical suggestion that private insurance should be expanded to displace NHS tax funding for healthcare. The virtue, as he sees it, is that the private sector can assess risks, raise capital, and provide services to the NHS on preferential terms, while operating assets commercially by allowing private access to them. In other words, he is just the kind of man to deliver Tony Blair's 'whatever works' vision. The son of Indian parents who came to Britain in 1969, Patel qualified as a doctor, but worked as a banker for Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers before founding nursing home group Court Cavendish in the Eighties. A year ago, with backing from Goldman Sachs, he took ailing Westminster Healthcare private for a total of \u00a3350 million. The aim was to create a pan-European healthcare operation worth at least \u00a31 billion before refloating it. Turnover has gone from \u00a3135m in 1998 to a projected \u00a3225m for the coming year. 'The business has gone to target. The growth expected in our business plan has come through,' he says. Patel has thinned the company's divisions from four to three, selling its sheltered housing operations. The backbone of the business is 'senior living', ranging from 90 care homes, to 'assisted living' services to help people remain in their own homes. Its specialist services division - dealing with behavioural and brain conditions - has been boosted with the \u00a3100m purchase of the Priory Healthcare hospitals group, which includes the south London clinic relied on by so many celebrities. Patel wants to expand this part of the business to offer stress management treatment to companies and individuals. Westminster is holding talks with firms including Welsh utilities group Hyder and leisure companies such as the David Lloyd health clubs about providing stress management to employees and members. The third element of the company is diagnostics services, including provision of hospital scanning equipment. Patel took a 2 per cent stake in the buyout vehicle when the Westminster acquisition was made last year, with the chance to raise this to 12 per cent if targets were hit. He says he is on course. 'We paid \u00a3350m for the business and we have spent \u00a3100m on Priory, which makes \u00a3450m. If you look at where the business is today and calculate future earnings, you would be looking at a present net value of about \u00a3600m,' he says. But Patel is shy of going too much further. 'Making profits out of healthcare is still an emotional issue,' he says. One benefit of being private is that he is not forced to make earnings statements to please the City but irritate patients and NHS staff. Nevertheless, these problems will increase if his vision of a relationship between the NHS and business blossoms. Despite the recent publicity, that relationship has existed for decades. NHS hospitals have provided pay beds for private patients since the Fifties, and general practitioners have long referred patients to private hospitals for surgery, often because of waiting lists. And, as Patel says, many care home places are now provided privately. But what he is now advocating is a quantum leap in the scale and scope of what the private sector offers. The use of private provision is ad hoc and complicated, with local social services departments and health authorities allocating budgets across the medical, nursing and residential sectors. Patel would like to see long-term national agreements drawn up across treatments, from acute care through nursing homes to home care. These agreements would be between the Government and named private providers which would have to meet quality criteria. Alongside these would be regional deals tailoring the national framework to local needs, possibly through new, simplified funding agencies. It all sounds neat, but how would it work? 'There should be long-term contracts, signed nationally, saying that if there is an overflow in a given service in a given area, this is how we would like the service to be provided, and this is who we would like to do it. On top of this, we see some areas - such as pathology and diagnostic testing - where we could become primary providers.' Potentially, then, companies such as Westminster could massively fatten their profits from taxpayers if they were included in contracts. True, says Patel, but 'provision should be by who can provide efficient and effective solutions'. He argues that only through public-private partnerships can new and effective methods of caring for patients be developed. Patel wants greater use of intermediate care and of remote technology to monitor patients at home. Both should come from the private sector - the first because spare places are available in homes at costs lower than in hospitals, and the second because buying home monitoring kit is more suited to the private sector, he says. The same logic applies to diagnostic services, such as hospital scanners. He says the NHS invests too little in this technology and uses much of what it has inefficiently. It is a plausible vision, which has been packaged so it can be defended against accusations of privatisation, and it's clear why the Government has chosen Patel to investigate its potential. But he will face problems. Simply saying that publicly funded healthcare carried out by the private sector remains a public good does not answer fully concerns about private involvement. The need for commercial returns, particularly from publicly quoted companies which have to make major investments in healthcare, could increase the cost of providing it. And regulating large-scale business providers would open a new series of economic and ethical questions, which would make overseeing Rail track or United Utilities seem like nursery school. Patel may be able to hide behind the convenience of corporate privacy now. But to realise his ambitions, it is not a position he will be able to maintain for ever.",

Wherever you looked last week the Aussies were supreme; from Durham's Simon Katich to Somerset's Jamie Cox, antipodean batsmen were gladdening Thommo's heart.

His Northamptonshire side - remember Hayden is one of three Aussies captaining county teams - had been set 391 from a minimum of 84 overs. The way Hayden set off he was interested in such a steep target. He hit 93 from 123 balls before being bowled by Richard Johnson and thereafter Northamptonshire sights were set on a draw.

It's hard to deny that a good proportion of Australia's second stringers would be good enough to play for our national team, whether it be Cox, Law, Lehmann, Elliott or indeed Hayden. </p> <p>Thommo's other carefully considered opinion - that Zimbabwe have nothing to worry about against England - is less easy to justify since the poor tourists have just been thrashed by an innings by Kent at Canterbury. Thommo, as ever, has been shooting from the hip. </p> <p>Hayden discovered a most benign fourth-day batting surface to atone for his first innings failure. Straw-coloured, despite the recent deluges, it offered nothing to the seamers and some slow turn for the spinners, all of which made Langer's cautious declaration understandable. </p> <p>Hayden had only three moments of anguish in his innings. There was a vehement appeal for lbw from Fraser at the start; in mid-innings he had to scamper when a direct hit from Shah at cover shattered the stumps at the bowler's end; at the end he was duped by an inswinger from Johnson. </p> <p>There's nothing enchanting about his batting. At 6ft 2in, he can get a long way down the pitch; he watches the ball fiercely and is clinical in the way he disposes of the poor ball; almost mechanical except there were occasions when he swept the turning ball with surprising deftness. </p> <p>His ally during an opening partnership of 152 was Rollins, a good acquisition from Derbyshire.

One of the Calaisiens already in Paris on the eve of the big match, he was fresh off the train, sporting a multicoloured scarf and an 'Allez Calais' hat, for a long - and, he hoped, triumphant - weekend in the capital. </p> <p>'This past week you couldn't move for reporters,' he said. 'They were everywhere, and they wanted anyone who could put two words together. My mate was on the eight o'clock news, and the Washington Post got hold of my cousin. We haven't seen that one yet, though. But when a serious paper like Le Monde publishes an eight-page supplement on Calais, you start to wonder what's up.' </p> <p>What's up is the football match of the season - some would say of the decade. This evening, turn off Manchester United, Chelsea, Leeds and the other public companies tediously playing each other to please their shareholders. Watch instead, if you can, a game that harks back to a more romantic time. </p> <p>In the black, red and yellow corner we have Calais Racing Union FC, an amateur club in the French Fourth Division, with a squad that includes a right-back who is an agent commercial dans une entreprise d'agencement de magasins , a midfielder who is a jardinier de la ville de Gravelines , and a centre-forward who is a magasinier dans un cash-and-carry . </p> <p>Their opponents, wearing yellow and green, are 11 Porsche and BMW-driving professionals from First Division club and cup-holders FC Nantes Atlantique, all of whom earn about \u00a35,000 a week. It is the first time an amateur club has made it to the Cup final in France or, indeed, anywhere. It's as if Folkestone Invicta had made it to Wembley. </p> <p>In England it could only be the stuff of fiction. J.L. Carr's How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won the FA Cup , for example, tells the story of a small amateur team triumphing thanks to a few remarkable men being in the same place at the same time. </p> <p>In France, it's for real. Television talkshows have been broadcasting from the town live for the past three days. 'Calais maketh the Cup run over!', screamed yesterday's front-page headline in the ever-irreverent Lib\u00e9ration . 'All of France behind Calais!' screeched a popular rival, Le Parisien . </p> <p>Out at Clairefontaine, the French national team's training centre, where the Calais team have been since Wednesday, the officials offered coach Ladislas Lozano the room used by Aim\u00e9 Jacquet, France's World Cup-winning trainer. He refused. He might be an OK coach, he said, but Jacquet was something else. </p> <p>The Calais hype is so overwhelming that some Nantes players are losing patience. 'In the beginning it was nice,' said forward Olivier Monterrubio. 'But now if they're on the telly, I switch channels. The worst thing is that, if we win, we'll be the big and bad and ugly, and we'll be booed. It's not good.' </p> <p>Calais is not, generally, a happy town. Unemployment is nearly 17 per cent, and almost half of its 75,000 inhabitants earn less than \u00a35,000 a year. Virtually all of the lucky few who got hold of the club's allocation of 19,300 tickets will travel down to Paris today on clapped-out old trains laid on for a special return fare of \u00a317.50. </p> <p>'The tickets have been a big disappointment,' admitted the newly-elected Communist Mayor, Jacky H\u00e9nin. 'As soon as we knew we were in the final, we rang round all the clubs to try to buy some of theirs. None wanted to [sell]. Now people have been calling up offering tickets for \u00a3100, \u00a3200. It's hard for people who hope so much.' </p> <p>But outside a brasserie at the Gare du Nord, a small group of young Calais fans were none the less determined to try their luck. 'It's the event of my life so far, no question,' said Nicolas, 17, an apprentice machinist. 'I'll try for a ticket tomorrow. But I can't go higher than \u00a350, and with the train that already means kissing goodbye to my summer holiday.' </p> <p>The Stade de France, where France beat Brazil to lift the World Cup two summers ago, will come as a change. The 80-year-old Calais ground would shame a side in the Kent county league, just across the Channel. </p> <p>There is one stand with seats for 500, shabby nets above the goals to prevent the ball going onto the main road, and a prefabricated hut where a Port Vale pennant has pride of place. </p> <p>This is the office of the club's chairman, Claude Thiriot. He came to Calais 32 years ago, fell in love, and stayed. During his tenure he managed to halve the club's debts of over 2 million francs (about \u00a3200,000). The cup run has covered the rest. The debts have disappeared and the profits have been redistributed among the players, who received \u00a310,000 a man for the semi-final victory and will receive another \u00a320,000 if they win tonight. </p> <p>But the strain is telling. 'Because he is a passionate guy working all the hours of the day and night, he has lost a stone and a half,' says his son, Nico. 'And at the age of 66, you do not want to lose weight like that.' </p> <p>Some of the Calais success is down to Thiriot Snr, and some to Lozano. He was brought from Spain to France at the age of five when his parents fled the Franco regime. He was a talented footballer in his youth, but unable to attend national trials because of his Spanish nationality. He is now a council foreman overseeing 60 workers who look after the local sports halls and grounds. </p> <p>A refreshingly straight-talking star of the French media last week, he has sparked furore by daring to suggest that his side's values of hard work, commitment, teamwork and the will to win had somehow been lost from the pampered world of French professional football. </p> <p>'We have written one of the most beautiful pages in French football history,' he said, in more conciliatory tones.

      "body": "<p>Eric Cantona's thespian talents have yet to propel him even onto Hollywood's C-list, but he still has the presence and allure to captivate this audience. </p> <p>While his former Manchester United team-mates continued their progress towards their target of 100 Premiership goals in a season, the sight of the man they called 'Dieu' in the directors' box was sufficient to avert the gaze of many supporters.</p> <p>The Frenchman nodded his approval as United produced a mesmerising first-half display - which reaped goals for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, David Beckham and Teddy Sheringham - but made a discreet exit before the latest coronation of the club he did so much to transform in the five years he spent here in the mid-Nineties. </p> <p>As unthinkable as it seems now they had not won the championship in 26 years before Cantona's arrival. Shortly before they saw their sixth Premiership title in eight years yesterday, the Old Trafford crowd launched into their repetoire of eulogies to their former idol. Heroes come and go, but none commands the adulation the Frenchman enjoys on his occasional returns to Manchester. </p> <p>Some would have it that Cantona's team, the one that ended the agonising wait and then won the Double the following year, is the finest in the club's history. In reality, however, it is hard to argue against Sir Alex Ferguson's protestation that this is his best side.

      "bodyText": "Eric Cantona's thespian talents have yet to propel him even onto Hollywood's C-list, but he still has the presence and allure to captivate this audience. While his former Manchester United team-mates continued their progress towards their target of 100 Premiership goals in a season, the sight of the man they called 'Dieu' in the directors' box was sufficient to avert the gaze of many supporters. The Frenchman nodded his approval as United produced a mesmerising first-half display - which reaped goals for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, David Beckham and Teddy Sheringham - but made a discreet exit before the latest coronation of the club he did so much to transform in the five years he spent here in the mid-Nineties. As unthinkable as it seems now they had not won the championship in 26 years before Cantona's arrival. Shortly before they saw their sixth Premiership title in eight years yesterday, the Old Trafford crowd launched into their repetoire of eulogies to their former idol. Heroes come and go, but none commands the adulation the Frenchman enjoys on his occasional returns to Manchester. Some would have it that Cantona's team, the one that ended the agonising wait and then won the Double the following year, is the finest in the club's history. In reality, however, it is hard to argue against Sir Alex Ferguson's protestation that this is his best side. The ton of goals may prove elusive, since they are four short ahead of next Sunday's trip to Aston Villa, but their greatness was reaffirmed yesterday. Ferguson said: 'For me, this is probably the best championship we've won. The performances have been excellent. We've scored 96 goals and we've got 88 points with a game left. That's unbelievable. But we shouldn't settle for that. 'The performance in the first half was absolutely marvellous. In the second half they were just enjoying themselves and I can't blame them for that. You don't often get the opportunity to relax these days.' George Graham's continued ill health denied him the chance to accompany his Tottenham team north, but he was fit enough to instruct Stuart Houston to play the youngster Matthew Etherington in place of David Ginola, who was not even among the substitutes. 'I explained to David this morning and he quite rightly was disappointed but he took it on board,' said Houston. United took just five minutes to break the resistance of a young Tottenham side, Solskjaer diverting Jaap Stam's header past Walker, but the visitors levelled on 20 minutes when the unmarked Chris Armstong scored with a diving header from Darren Anderton's cross. Yet again the thought occurred that United would enjoy the world-beating status they aspire to if only they could sort out a defence whose record is the worst in the top six. But, with Ryan Giggs playing superbly, a United victory was never in doubt. Beckham then curled home a stunning second before Sheringham ran clear to score on what was surely his Old Trafford swansong.

Burton lobbed a pass to the edge of the box, Murray steadied himself and volleyed only for Given to make a superb save and then react fastest to claw the ball away from his own line. </p> <p>Derby's Georgi Kinkladze took possession on halfway and there seemed little danger but after spiriting past two defenders, the defence backed off and Kinkladze produced an impish chip from the edge of the area that deserved better than to cannon off the underside of the crossbar, hit Given on the way out and win only a corner. </p> <p>With his defence a shambles, the Newcastle manager Bobby Robson threw on Didier Domi for Alessandro Pistone after just 13 minutes, although the Italian did clutch his hamstring for effect as he reached the touchline. </p> <p>Robert Lee was shown the yellow card for a nasty looking challenge on Kinkladze and then risked an early end to his afternoon by lunging in on Burton, although referee Alan Wiley felt a free-kick and a ticking off were sufficient punishment.</p> <p>Mart Poom - named as Derby's player of the season before the match - made his first real save after half an hour from Temuri Ketsbaia's 20-yard shot that the Estonian turned round his left-hand post.</p> <p>The midfield battle between Kinkladze and Lee continued when a free-kick was given against the Newcastle midfielder for shirt-pulling, a foul that earned him his second lecture. </p> <p>At half-time the injured Kinkladze was replaced by Dean Sturridge, yet Derby started the second half as they had the first. </p> <p>Lee and Ketsbaia both went close for the visitors but it was Given's goal that came closest to being breached. Sturridge pulled a cross back from the by-line to Burton, who got the slightest flick at the near post.

      "bodyText": "Derby were able to celebrate safety even though results elsewhere rendered their point won against Newcastle meaningless. Starting the game needing a draw to maintain their Premiership status, the Rams controlled the contest for long periods and always looked likely to earn a share of the spoils. It could have been three points but the Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given, superb throughout, was able to pull off a brilliant stop to deny Deon Burton's near-post flick eight minutes from time. The suspended duo Rory Delap and Seth Johnson missed out for Derby so Jim Smith drafted Tony Dorigo and Adam Murray into his starting line-up. The home side created the first opening when Dorigo played a neat one-two with Deon Burton down the left. Burton lobbed a pass to the edge of the box, Murray steadied himself and volleyed only for Given to make a superb save and then react fastest to claw the ball away from his own line. Derby's Georgi Kinkladze took possession on halfway and there seemed little danger but after spiriting past two defenders, the defence backed off and Kinkladze produced an impish chip from the edge of the area that deserved better than to cannon off the underside of the crossbar, hit Given on the way out and win only a corner. With his defence a shambles, the Newcastle manager Bobby Robson threw on Didier Domi for Alessandro Pistone after just 13 minutes, although the Italian did clutch his hamstring for effect as he reached the touchline. Robert Lee was shown the yellow card for a nasty looking challenge on Kinkladze and then risked an early end to his afternoon by lunging in on Burton, although referee Alan Wiley felt a free-kick and a ticking off were sufficient punishment. Mart Poom - named as Derby's player of the season before the match - made his first real save after half an hour from Temuri Ketsbaia's 20-yard shot that the Estonian turned round his left-hand post. The midfield battle between Kinkladze and Lee continued when a free-kick was given against the Newcastle midfielder for shirt-pulling, a foul that earned him his second lecture. At half-time the injured Kinkladze was replaced by Dean Sturridge, yet Derby started the second half as they had the first. Lee and Ketsbaia both went close for the visitors but it was Given's goal that came closest to being breached. Sturridge pulled a cross back from the by-line to Burton, who got the slightest flick at the near post. Given was already down but reacted superbly to the change of direction and saved on the line.",

The subject of endless bar-room debates is finally being made into a major television documentary series by the BBC. Three Lions , billed as the definitive history of England since that famous afternoon at Wembley, is the result of two years filming and scores of interviews with players, managers, fans and even some of the hooligans who have made English football synonymous with trouble. The three-parter will go out on consecutive nights in early June in the run-up to Euro 2000. Each 50-minute programme will cover a particular phase in England's decline and fall since the events that prompted Kenneth Wolstenholme to declare: 'They think it's all over - it is now!' The 1966-74 phase is examined by concentrating on the late, great Bobby Moore; 1974-86 by focusing on Kevin Keegan; and 1986-2000 by probing the life and times of Paul Gascoigne, probably the ultimate one-man embodiment of a nation's footballing frailties. The BBC claims that the series 'will strip the mystery away from our national heroes, our national villains and our national game'. Exclusive material is promised, and the interview with Keegan is apparently a belter.

Green uses the launch of a new football website involving himself and Mirror super-sleuth Harry Harris to say: 'Even if he is right [that the dour Wembley game was worth watching], then he is discriminating against 99.5 per cent of his own viewing public who have never played at his level.

      "body": "<p>Does any urban holidaymaker really want to fry in a freak Athenian heat wave, fall from a Madrid high-rise, be shot by a London road rager, or get mugged at the carnival in Rio?</p> <p>Play safe and stay in the metropolis that houses Europe's third largest opera house, whose centre consists of lush, expansive botanical gardens and in which the greatest civilisations have stayed for centuries, bequeathing their cultural and culinary legacies. Visit the city where the young gather during the day, hungry and enthusiastic to participate in contemporary art, avant garde theatre and cultural debate; where the elderly throng the streets all night; and which has had no murder for at least 14 months. Stroll unhindered through illuminated avenues where elegant baroque churches, Norman monuments, Spanish palaces, Arabic cupolas, and Renaissance churches are comfortably juxtaposed. Get sidetracked by Byzantine street markets clogging creakingly medieval warrens. Take a tip from Guy de Maupassant: 'If you search for knife wounds or for arrests, then go to Paris or London, but don't come here, where you can travel throughout night and day, without escort or arms; you will find only extreme benevolence towards foreigners.' </p> <p>The city is Palermo, in Sicily. Grabbed first by the Carthaginians, it later fell to the Romans, then the Saracens, and later to the Normans, under whom it flowered as Europe's greatest metropolis, famed for its wealthy court, its centre of learning and its slightly devilish reputation. Palermo's cultural and commercial importance was maintained for several centuries under Spanish domination until Garibaldi decided to use it as a starting point for his successful unification of Italy during the latter half of the nineteenth century. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Palermo elected modernism (Art Nouveau) to express the wealth and prestige of a thriving entrepreneurial class that built theatres rather than churches. Nowhere was this better manifested than by the grand hall of the hotel in which I was registering for my first Sicilian night, the Villa Igiea, a classic Art Nouveau villa designed by Ernesto Basile in 1900 and which originally belonged to relatives of the Florios, Palermo's most important industrial family and the first people to put tuna into cans. </p> <p>Woken the next morning by a strong wind, I felt confused and puzzled. Palermo? Wasn't it meant to provide a heavy, dangerous and life-threatening ambience? Wasn't it the place that all the American gangsters I met in prison regarded as their holy of holies? Wasn't it the headquarters of the world's greatest-ever criminal organisation, the Mafia? Where are they? </p> <p>Although there is an alternative theory (Mafia is derived from the Arabic mu'afah, meaning 'refuge or protection'), it is widely thought that Mafia is the acronym of Morte Ai Francesi Italiani Allarme, (Death to all the Waiting Frenchmen threatened by the Italians) the battle cry of the Sicilian Vespers, a fierce thirteenth-century separatist movement, which opposed the injustice of perpetual foreign rule and pursued an egalitarian ideal. And that's the way it stayed for almost all of the second millennium, as French rule gave way to Spanish and Austrian despots. Even Garibaldi's unification fell far short of Sicilian expectations: the island was still ruled by remote and uncaring bureaucrats, only now from Rome rather than any other European capital. By this time, the Mafia, with its ubiquitous anti-imperialist tentacles, had become the people's champion. </p> <p>But even in an autonomous country which is politically at rest, organised crime can be equally well spawned by the government enacting a few irrational and unjust laws and regulations. During the early years of the twentieth century, the United States government informed hundreds of thousands of its newly welcomed Italian immigrants that they could no longer pursue their traditional practices of drinking wine and buying lottery tickets. Prohibition and the elimination of the so-called numbers rackets were the orders of the day. </p> <p>The Mafia saw another opportunity to represent the populace. Legal and illegal economies intertwined, as did criminal organisations and social institutions. Drugs and money laundering might well be the best known aspects of today's criminal activities, but the most devastating is the connection between politics and crime. This mixture of illegal and legal, criminal and institutional, is actually the heart of the Mafia's historical model. </p> <p>In post-unification Sicily, violence and illegality have generally been regarded as non-punishable forms of survival and acceptable ways of acquiring a social role; the legal economy is too weak to offer substantial opportunities. The state and the institutions are seen as distant and foreign, and approachable only through the mediation of the Mafiosi and their friends. For the Mafia, rights don't exist; there are only favours. But where are they? </p> <p>I didn't feel I had enough time to search for the Mob. After all, I had a travel piece to write and had to set about reaching the Aeolian Islands. A full Italian buffet breakfast should have helped hasten my resolve, but the waiters discomfited me by staring at my unmanicured nails, dishevelled hair, and clothes adorned with unknown designer labels. One, who seemed to take pity on me, looked at my guide book, and said: 'You will not get to the islands today, signore. The sirocco is blowing too strong. But there is much to see here.' </p> <p>I'm a sucker for regular sightseeing tours, so I took one. I ogled unashamedly at the beauties sporting the latest Milanese and Florentian fashions, dodged the Vespas and the baby buggies, bought some cigarettes at an exquisite tobacco kiosk and popped inside the cathedral to view St Agatha's arm and Mary Magdalen's foot. </p> <p>I was ready for Palermo's most gruesome attraction: its catacombs. Il Convento dei Cappuccini, on the edge of the city, houses almost 10,000 bodies preserved by chemical and dehydration processes, including the use of vinegar, arsenic and quick lime. The corpses are displayed either wearing their normal clothes in niches along labyrinthine corridors, or stacked in glass coffins. Most are vile, contorted, grinning, decomposed; others, with full heads of hair, stare right at you. </p> <p>'Here the people of Palermo pay daily visits to their deceased friend - familiarise themselves with their future state - choose the company they would wish to keep in the other world - make choice of their niche - try if their body fits it - stand for hours,' wrote Patrick Brydone in his eighteenth-century account of A Tour through Sicily and Malta. </p> <p>Surprisingly, the walk through the catacombs made me feel like lunch. I obviously had to eat at the Grande Albergo e delle Palme, where Richard Wagner composed Parsifal in 1882, and where Mafia leaders met in October 1957 to organise the world's drug trade. </p> <p>A bottle of Brunello di Montalcino made me think again of the Mob. While the US alcohol industry and casinos became safely and legally controlled by Italians, things were getting a bit rough back home in Sicily. Mussolini had come to power and dispatched Cesare Mori to eradicate the Mafia. Mori unjustly jailed thousands for trivial offences, driving the Mafia deeper underground. Popular discontent continued to be manifested by brigandage and its accompanying omerta, or conspiracy of silence, deeply rooted not just in its romantic banditry but also in its more sinister network of mutual interests and politically binding organised criminality. </p> <p>The moral stature of the outlaw increased to Robin Hood proportions as nobility and misery chased each other. The United States seemed a far more acceptable fatherland than Italy, so much so that the Mafia enabled General George Patton's US invasion of Italy in 1943. Sicilians had obviously expected some sort of appropriate reward for their unconventional wartime services, such as annexation to the US, membership of the British Empire, or at least independence. Instead, anarchy, hunger and a problematic, Stormont-type regional assembly followed the Second World War. Much of Palermo's port and medieval town had been bombed into a ramshackle building site and the sea had been pushed back 200 yards from a once-magnificent promenade. Rubble from wartime was dumped there and the newly created area was left as a squalid, weed infested, no man's land. </p> <p>Encouraged by the US dollar, Communism was perceived to be the enemy and banditry was once again unleashed as separatism. Political patronage grew; Mafia-infested building projects littered the island with half-finished housing estates and office blocks. But where are they? Why aren't there tourist trips to known Mafia haunts of the past? Could today's drug-dealing Mafia be just the creation of pulp thriller writers, the imaginations of a sensationalist press, a fabrication of Italian and US governments anxious for scapegoats? Didn't Mario Puzo make it all up when he wrote The Godfather ? Puzo claims that his choice of the surname Corleone for his Godfather was random. It could just as well have been Montelpre, Lerca Freddi or Partinico. But when the boss of them all, il capo dei tutti capi, Salvatore Riina, was arrested in 1993, it was revealed that he had lived undisturbed for 20 years (with his children registered at the local school and hospital) in the small town of Corleone. Aren't coincidences amazing? Yeah, right. </p> <p>I took a taxi to Corleone. There is absolutely nothing there that looks as though it could begin to be associated with any criminal organisation, or a Hollywood movie. I concluded that either all the Mafiosi were in Palermo's Ucciardone prison or that the Mafia is as invisible as it is ineradicable. </p> <p>Next morning, boats between the Sicilian islands had resumed operations, but I decided to take the train along the Tyrrhenian Coast and get a boat from Milazzo to the Aeolian Islands. During the holiday season, there are other means of making the trip, such as a direct ferry from Palermo, but this way is hard to beat. For quite long stretches, the track is only a few yards from the water's edge. </p> <p>I opened the carriage window and allowed my face to be bathed with friendly splashes of spray. This part of the coast is dedicated to holidaying with its series of cliffs, coves, sandy strips, stony strips, citrus groves, mighty medieval cathedrals, hilltop strongholds, Norman castles, Greco-Roman archaeological remains and oil refineries that look strangely at home. Roman villas crouch timidly under viaducts linking thermal spas with water good for both curing arthritis and making pasta. Despite the train's relaxed progress, the terrain was quickly and noticeably changing from the rough and rugged Arabic West coast to the green and fertile East. At the stations, you could detect the singsong Palermo accent giving way to a more clipped Siracusian, evidencing the centuries in antiquity that Sicily remained a divided island. When the Carthaginians settled in western Sicily in the eighth century BC, the Greeks simultaneously established a colony in the east and swiftly exploited the island's fertility (Demeter, Greek goddess of grain and fecundity, was Sicily's chief deity) and introduced the olive and the vine, heralding Sicily's role as Rome's granary (The Roman statesman Cato called it 'the nurse at whose breast the Roman people are fed'.) Siracusa became a prominent centre of early Christianity and was briefly the capital of the Byzantine Empire. </p> <p>Three hours after leaving Palermo, I disembarked at Milazzo and was relieved to note that hydrofoils were opertating. The Aeolian Islands are sleepy, seductive and timelessly tranquil. Although frequent storms reinforce the feeling of isolation, an enveloping calm masks this volcanically active seven-island archipelago that abounds with myths associated with elemental and unpredictable power. </p> <p>Volcanoes used to be seen as the mouths of hell. Jupiter's son Vulcan, the god of fire and metalworking, had his workshop there. Aeolus, the god of winds and navigation, kept his winds in one of the caves. He presented them in a wineskin to Odysseus (whose curious crew let them out, causing the ship to be blown back to port). More recently, Professor Lindbrook and his colleagues emerged there in Jules Verne's Journey to the Centre of the Earth . </p> <p>An hour after leaving Milazzo, the hydrofoil stopped at Vulcano, which boasts mud baths, hot springs and a smoking crater. An extremely strong and unappetising, sulphurous rotten-egg smell permeates the atmosphere. Acrid and yellow plumes of vapour menacingly puff away, serving as constant reminders of the silent power beneath. Orange and red flashes indicate the underlying pyrotechnic progress. No one lived here before the eighteenth century, and there have been several hasty evacuations since. </p> <p>Saffron-coloured earth and the intense reds and oranges of the iron and aluminium sulphates sear the eyes. Visitors and residents bathe in thick yellow soup pools of foul - smelling sulphurous mud, as if attending some deviant ancient ceremony. </p> <p>I took the hydrofoil to Lipari, the most interesting of the islands. A Carthaginian base during the First Punic War with Rome, Lipari was the scene of a terrible slaughter in 1544 at the hands of the famous North African pirate, Red Beard (Barbarossa or Khair ed-Din), who consigned to slavery all 10,000 survivors of the massacre. Lipari's main commercial attraction (until the rest of the world invented steel) was its rare sharp black glass (excellent for weapon making) erupted by the now extinct Monte Pelato. </p> <p>I walked through alleyways of chic boutiques and souvenir emporiums interspersed with alimentari (capers, olives, and malvasia grapes) and fishing tackle shops and checked into the Hotel Villa Meligunis, an eighteenth-century villa. I have never been looked after with such a perfect combination of dignified reserve and exuberant hospitality. </p> <p>As evening approached, I took a walk up to Il Castello, a medieval castle where Odysseus lingered after his historical battle with Cyclops. Today, it is the site of one of the world's finest archaeological museums, Museo Eoliano, best known for housing the oldest and most complete range of Greek theatrical masks used in early performances of the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides and the comedies of Aristophanes and Melander. Inside, you are immediately surrounded by 6,000 years of evidence that the Greeks once definitely knew how to large it and have a good time. </p> <p>Lipari's income is based on tourism and a revitalised pumice industry. Pumice (red volcanic glass) is used for the manufacture of toothpaste, light bulbs, bleach, and fertiliser. Its extraction by quivering Heath Robinson/Meccano-style machinery a few minutes drive from Lipari kept me childishly fascinated for hours. Although the process leaves brilliant white scars in the lush Aeolian countryside, they blend in perfectly with massive rocks that have been striped by nature with red, orange and yellow hues. These colours flow into the ocean alongside 30-yard-long pumice chutes used by workers as the most effective way of getting their bodies into the sea to cool off. All work should be this much fun. </p> <p>Lipari is ideal for leisurely natural history and archaeological excursions. Huge spiky multi-coloured rocks, or faraglione, protrude from a limpid and uncontaminated sea, watched by rare migratory birds nesting on cliffs. Excavations of superimposed layers of occupation from Neolithic to Roman times provide a continuous record. </p> <p>The vices of mankind no longer seem to threaten anyone in Lipari. Cars and houses are left unlocked; police are absent or invisible; no one is looking for a fight. I went to bed praying for a storm so I could be stranded here indefinitely. </p> <p> Howard Marks's travel between London and Palermo together with accommodation at the five-star Grand Villa Igiea, Palermo, was arranged by Magic of Italy (0208 748 7575; <a href=\"http://www.magictravelgroup.co.uk)\">www.magictravelgroup.co.uk</a>) which offers both three- and seven-night packages, starting at \u00a3449 and \u00a3689 respectively. </p> <p>Accommodation at the Hotel Villa Meligunis and travel in the Aeolian Islands was arranged by Ossidiana Travel, Via Ten, Amendola, 22, Lipari 98055 (tel: 00 39 090 981 1519).</p>",

I was ready for Palermo's most gruesome attraction: its catacombs. Il Convento dei Cappuccini, on the edge of the city, houses almost 10,000 bodies preserved by chemical and dehydration processes, including the use of vinegar, arsenic and quick lime. The corpses are displayed either wearing their normal clothes in niches along labyrinthine corridors, or stacked in glass coffins. Most are vile, contorted, grinning, decomposed; others, with full heads of hair, stare right at you. 'Here the people of Palermo pay daily visits to their deceased friend - familiarise themselves with their future state - choose the company they would wish to keep in the other world - make choice of their niche - try if their body fits it - stand for hours,' wrote Patrick Brydone in his eighteenth-century account of A Tour through Sicily and Malta. Surprisingly, the walk through the catacombs made me feel like lunch. I obviously had to eat at the Grande Albergo e delle Palme, where Richard Wagner composed Parsifal in 1882, and where Mafia leaders met in October 1957 to organise the world's drug trade. A bottle of Brunello di Montalcino made me think again of the Mob. While the US alcohol industry and casinos became safely and legally controlled by Italians, things were getting a bit rough back home in Sicily. Mussolini had come to power and dispatched Cesare Mori to eradicate the Mafia. Mori unjustly jailed thousands for trivial offences, driving the Mafia deeper underground. Popular discontent continued to be manifested by brigandage and its accompanying omerta, or conspiracy of silence, deeply rooted not just in its romantic banditry but also in its more sinister network of mutual interests and politically binding organised criminality. The moral stature of the outlaw increased to Robin Hood proportions as nobility and misery chased each other. The United States seemed a far more acceptable fatherland than Italy, so much so that the Mafia enabled General George Patton's US invasion of Italy in 1943. Sicilians had obviously expected some sort of appropriate reward for their unconventional wartime services, such as annexation to the US, membership of the British Empire, or at least independence. Instead, anarchy, hunger and a problematic, Stormont-type regional assembly followed the Second World War. Much of Palermo's port and medieval town had been bombed into a ramshackle building site and the sea had been pushed back 200 yards from a once-magnificent promenade. Rubble from wartime was dumped there and the newly created area was left as a squalid, weed infested, no man's land. Encouraged by the US dollar, Communism was perceived to be the enemy and banditry was once again unleashed as separatism. Political patronage grew; Mafia-infested building projects littered the island with half-finished housing estates and office blocks. But where are they? Why aren't there tourist trips to known Mafia haunts of the past? Could today's drug-dealing Mafia be just the creation of pulp thriller writers, the imaginations of a sensationalist press, a fabrication of Italian and US governments anxious for scapegoats? Didn't Mario Puzo make it all up when he wrote The Godfather ? Puzo claims that his choice of the surname Corleone for his Godfather was random. It could just as well have been Montelpre, Lerca Freddi or Partinico. But when the boss of them all, il capo dei tutti capi, Salvatore Riina, was arrested in 1993, it was revealed that he had lived undisturbed for 20 years (with his children registered at the local school and hospital) in the small town of Corleone. Aren't coincidences amazing? Yeah, right. I took a taxi to Corleone. There is absolutely nothing there that looks as though it could begin to be associated with any criminal organisation, or a Hollywood movie. I concluded that either all the Mafiosi were in Palermo's Ucciardone prison or that the Mafia is as invisible as it is ineradicable. Next morning, boats between the Sicilian islands had resumed operations, but I decided to take the train along the Tyrrhenian Coast and get a boat from Milazzo to the Aeolian Islands. During the holiday season, there are other means of making the trip, such as a direct ferry from Palermo, but this way is hard to beat. For quite long stretches, the track is only a few yards from the water's edge. I opened the carriage window and allowed my face to be bathed with friendly splashes of spray. This part of the coast is dedicated to holidaying with its series of cliffs, coves, sandy strips, stony strips, citrus groves, mighty medieval cathedrals, hilltop strongholds, Norman castles, Greco-Roman archaeological remains and oil refineries that look strangely at home. Roman villas crouch timidly under viaducts linking thermal spas with water good for both curing arthritis and making pasta. Despite the train's relaxed progress, the terrain was quickly and noticeably changing from the rough and rugged Arabic West coast to the green and fertile East. At the stations, you could detect the singsong Palermo accent giving way to a more clipped Siracusian, evidencing the centuries in antiquity that Sicily remained a divided island. When the Carthaginians settled in western Sicily in the eighth century BC, the Greeks simultaneously established a colony in the east and swiftly exploited the island's fertility (Demeter, Greek goddess of grain and fecundity, was Sicily's chief deity) and introduced the olive and the vine, heralding Sicily's role as Rome's granary (The Roman statesman Cato called it 'the nurse at whose breast the Roman people are fed'.) Siracusa became a prominent centre of early Christianity and was briefly the capital of the Byzantine Empire. Three hours after leaving Palermo, I disembarked at Milazzo and was relieved to note that hydrofoils were opertating. The Aeolian Islands are sleepy, seductive and timelessly tranquil. Although frequent storms reinforce the feeling of isolation, an enveloping calm masks this volcanically active seven-island archipelago that abounds with myths associated with elemental and unpredictable power. Volcanoes used to be seen as the mouths of hell. Jupiter's son Vulcan, the god of fire and metalworking, had his workshop there. Aeolus, the god of winds and navigation, kept his winds in one of the caves. He presented them in a wineskin to Odysseus (whose curious crew let them out, causing the ship to be blown back to port). More recently, Professor Lindbrook and his colleagues emerged there in Jules Verne's Journey to the Centre of the Earth . An hour after leaving Milazzo, the hydrofoil stopped at Vulcano, which boasts mud baths, hot springs and a smoking crater. An extremely strong and unappetising, sulphurous rotten-egg smell permeates the atmosphere. Acrid and yellow plumes of vapour menacingly puff away, serving as constant reminders of the silent power beneath. Orange and red flashes indicate the underlying pyrotechnic progress. No one lived here before the eighteenth century, and there have been several hasty evacuations since. Saffron-coloured earth and the intense reds and oranges of the iron and aluminium sulphates sear the eyes. Visitors and residents bathe in thick yellow soup pools of foul - smelling sulphurous mud, as if attending some deviant ancient ceremony. I took the hydrofoil to Lipari, the most interesting of the islands. A Carthaginian base during the First Punic War with Rome, Lipari was the scene of a terrible slaughter in 1544 at the hands of the famous North African pirate, Red Beard (Barbarossa or Khair ed-Din), who consigned to slavery all 10,000 survivors of the massacre. Lipari's main commercial attraction (until the rest of the world invented steel) was its rare sharp black glass (excellent for weapon making) erupted by the now extinct Monte Pelato. I walked through alleyways of chic boutiques and souvenir emporiums interspersed with alimentari (capers, olives, and malvasia grapes) and fishing tackle shops and checked into the Hotel Villa Meligunis, an eighteenth-century villa. I have never been looked after with such a perfect combination of dignified reserve and exuberant hospitality. As evening approached, I took a walk up to Il Castello, a medieval castle where Odysseus lingered after his historical battle with Cyclops. Today, it is the site of one of the world's finest archaeological museums, Museo Eoliano, best known for housing the oldest and most complete range of Greek theatrical masks used in early performances of the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides and the comedies of Aristophanes and Melander. Inside, you are immediately surrounded by 6,000 years of evidence that the Greeks once definitely knew how to large it and have a good time. Lipari's income is based on tourism and a revitalised pumice industry. Pumice (red volcanic glass) is used for the manufacture of toothpaste, light bulbs, bleach, and fertiliser. Its extraction by quivering Heath Robinson/Meccano-style machinery a few minutes drive from Lipari kept me childishly fascinated for hours. Although the process leaves brilliant white scars in the lush Aeolian countryside, they blend in perfectly with massive rocks that have been striped by nature with red, orange and yellow hues. These colours flow into the ocean alongside 30-yard-long pumice chutes used by workers as the most effective way of getting their bodies into the sea to cool off. All work should be this much fun. Lipari is ideal for leisurely natural history and archaeological excursions. Huge spiky multi-coloured rocks, or faraglione, protrude from a limpid and uncontaminated sea, watched by rare migratory birds nesting on cliffs. Excavations of superimposed layers of occupation from Neolithic to Roman times provide a continuous record. The vices of mankind no longer seem to threaten anyone in Lipari. Cars and houses are left unlocked; police are absent or invisible; no one is looking for a fight. I went to bed praying for a storm so I could be stranded here indefinitely. Howard Marks's travel between London and Palermo together with accommodation at the five-star Grand Villa Igiea, Palermo, was arranged by Magic of Italy (0208 748 7575; www.magictravelgroup.co.uk) which offers both three- and seven-night packages, starting at \u00a3449 and \u00a3689 respectively. Accommodation at the Hotel Villa Meligunis and travel in the Aeolian Islands was arranged by Ossidiana Travel, Via Ten, Amendola, 22, Lipari 98055 (tel: 00 39 090 981 1519).",

      "body": "<p>Wherever you're driving in Italy, it is only a matter of time until you pass one of those tempting signs marked Strada del Vino, pointing to a narrow road that disappears mysteriously among a gentle maze of criss-cross lines of well-tended vines. </p> <p>It is a reminder that although stopping off at wine producers in France has become an integral part of summer holidays, it is not the first thing that comes to mind when visiting Italy. There's so much cultural sightseeing here that after a day's dose of churches, castles, frescoes and paintings, museums and monuments, you tend to think about tasting the local vino only at dinner. Yet Italy produces more wine than France and is now increasing its quality by leaps and bounds. </p> <p>There's always a huge difference between sampling wines among the vineyards where they're grown and at home, though many of the best Italian bottles never make it to Britain anyway. It is quite easy to plan a trip across a couple of the country's diverse regions, tasting not just the wine, but local cuisine and seeing some of the less-visited sights. </p> <p>Italy became one country only as recently as 1861, so the wines are markedly different in each province, the customs and history differ, and the strange-sounding traditional dialects often mask a completely different language. </p> <p>Rather than arm yourself with just a classic guidebook, it is worth investing in the English translation of Italy's leading annual wine handbook, Italian Wines, published jointly by Gambero Rosso Editore and Slow Food Editore, at \u00a325.95. As for eating out, Italy is unbeatable for its simple, inexpensive osterie and trattorie, the ideal spot to feast on a plate of steaming pasta accompanied by a bottle of the local vino rosso or bianco. </p> <p><strong>1 Valpolicella </strong></p> <p><strong>The region:</strong> Veneto, which stretches from the scenic Lake Garda across to the towering Dolomite mountains and down to the Adriatic sea, is one of the most seductive regions of Italy, and that is before you even set foot in the romantic cities of Verona and Venice. Apart from the picturesque vineyards, the landscapes are marked by elegant Palladian villas, walled medieval villages and grand Renaissance churches. </p> <p><strong> The wine: </strong> Much maligned over the years as cheap Italian plonk, the humble Valpolicella has a much more respected reputation at home. You'll discover that the superiore is markedly better than the less expensive classico. But the fun begins when tasting the local specialities. Amarone is a deliciously rich, aged Valpolicella, but it is exceptionally strong. Then there is Ricioto, a luscious, sweet red dessert wine. <br> </p> <p><strong> The address:</strong> La Bottega del Vino, Via Scudo di Francia 3, Verona. Tel: (0039) 045 8004535. It is closed on Tuesdays. </p> <p>Each April, Verona hosts Vinitaly, the nation's major wine fair, but right in the heart of Romeo and Juliet's city, great wines can be tasted every day at this cosy, wood-panelled wine bar. There's a fine restaurant at the back, but the real action is by the bar where the list of wines by the glass changes each day. </p> <p><strong> 2 Marsala</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> The region:</strong> Sicily is the largest island in the Mediterranean, and resembles a tiny independent country outside Italy's borders and almost outside Europe. Invading Greeks, Spaniards, Arabs and Normans all left temples, palaces and churches across the island's ruggedly beautiful landscapes, while even our own Admiral Nelson built a private castle at the foot of Mount Etna as a love nest for Lady Hamilton. </p> <p><strong> The wine:</strong> Drunk as an aperitif or to accompany a sharp-tasting cheese, Marsala was developed for the British market at the end of the eighteenth century. This rich, heady wine takes its name from the port of Marsala, but the most scenic place to visit vineyards is around Agrigento, which has one of the finest Greek temples outside Athens. </p> <p><strong> The address:</strong> Hosteria dei Vesperi, Piazza Croce dei Vesperi 6, Palermo, Sicily. Tel: 0039 091 6171631. Closed Sundays. </p> <p>Smack in the historic centre of the pulsating city of Palermo, this osteria specialises in both Sicilian wines and traditional cuisine. Some of the greatest new wines in Italy are being made in Sicily now, especially Chardonnay and Nero d'Avola, a Syrah-like grape. Try them accompanied by a classic pasta con sarde, or spaghetti with fresh sardines, pine nuts and wild fennel. </p> <p><strong> 3 Barolo</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The region:</strong> Piedmont is not simply next to France geographically but culturally too. Driving through the vine-covered hills of the Langhe and the truffle-filled forests around Alba has a feel similar to exploring Burgundy. Don't neglect to visit the region's dynamic capital, Turin, which will host the next Winter Olympics, and is refreshingly untouristy. </p> <p><strong> The wine:</strong> Barolo can quite simply be called the king of Italian red wines, an outstanding full-bodied wine that, like a Bordeaux, needs to age for several years for it to lose its hard tannic taste. Unfortunately, it is also seriously expensive, especially if you decide to taste some of the more renowned producers such as Gaja, Pio Cesare and the grandly-named Marchesi di Barolo. </p> <p><strong> The address:</strong> Boccondivino, Via Mendicita Istruita 14, Bra, Piedmont. Tel: 0039 0172 425674. Closed Sunday </p> <p>Bra is home to the renowned Italian wine and food movement, Slow Food, so it's no surprise that the town's local enoteca stocks over 150 different types of Barolo in its cellar. Don't neglect some of the other excellent Piedmont vintages such as Barbaresco, Barbera and Dolcetto. They are perfect with a traditional bagna cauda, a delicious vegetable fondue based on anchovies and garlic. </p> <p><strong> 4 Frascati</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The region:</strong> Latium, the ancient area known in Italy as Lazio, is dominated by the national capital, Rome, and few tourists explore further than the Eternal City. </p> <p>Apart from interesting Etruscan remains around Tarquinia and Cerveteri, there is one of Italy's best-hidden secrets waiting to be discovered, the idyllic island of Ponza. </p> <p><strong> The wine:</strong> Sit down at any restaurant in Rome and you can be sure that the vino di tavola will be a carafe of fresh, light Frascati. Grown in pretty vineyards less than 20 miles south of the capital, this is by no means the greatest white wine in Italy. But on a hot summer's day, sitting out on a sunny terrace, enjoying a bottle of one of the superiore vintages, especially from the cantina of Count Zandotti, can be unforgettable. </p> <p><strong> The address:</strong> Ristorante del Pallaro, Largo del Pallaro 15, Rome, Lazio. Tel: 0039 06 68801488. Closed Sundays. </p> <p>A delightful dose of La Dolce Vita is guaranteed at this friendly old-fashioned trattoria, just by Rome's famed Piazza Navona. There there is no menu, just a steady stream of dishes prepared by La Mamma in the kitchen, from antipasti right through to dessert, with a chilled bottle of Frascati in the middle of the table. </p> <p><strong> 5 Orvieto</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The region:</strong> Umbria is a close rival to its neighbour, Tuscany, for dramatic country landscapes and perfectly preserved medieval and Renaissance towns. The crowds may flock to the renowned sights of Giotto's frescoes at Assisi and the cavernous Gothic cathedral in Orvieto, but you'll find the rest of the region much more peaceful, especially around Lake Trasemino, which is great for fishing and swimming. </p> <p>It is worth noting two major festivals, for arts, music and film in July and August at Spoleto, and an irresistible chocolate festival in Perugia in October. </p> <p><strong> The wine:</strong> Although Umbria is trying to follow Tuscany's lead in producing a new range of superior red wines, the internationally popular white Orvieto still accounts for 80 per cent of all the wine produced here, and there are some very different levels of quality. The Etruscans began making wine in Umbria more than 2,000 years ago, and over the centuries Orvieto has been transformed from a light, sweet wine into today's dry, straw-coloured variety. </p> <p><strong> The address:</strong> I Sette Consoli, Piazza Sant'Angelo 1, Orvieto, Umbria. Tel: 0039 0763 343911. Closed Wednesdays. </p> <p>With coachloads of tourists flocking to the town of Orvieto, there are plenty of rip-off places selling poor-quality, expensive local wine. The Seven Consuls, though, is a serious gastronomic restaurant with an equally serious wine list to sample some of the better Orvieto producers. </p> <p><strong> 6 Chianti</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The region:</strong> Tuscany is most people's dream destination in Italy, but images of opulent villas and wealthy expats sitting by the pool in 'Chiantishire' are a long way from the real picture. Outside the great cities of Florence, Pisa and Sienna, Tuscany is essentially a very rural community, and behind the serene lines of cypress trees atop rolling hills it doesn't take long to find quiet villages and friendly agroturismo guest houses unspoilt by tourism. </p> <p><strong> The wine: </strong> Enthusiasts will tell you that Tuscany's most respected wines today are Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, but it is Chianti that is known throughout the world. Claiming to be the world's oldest officially defined wine-producing area, dating from a 1716 decree, the unique taste of Chianti was developed by Baron Bettino Ricasoli in the early nineteenth century, and it is still worth visiting his castle and vineyards in Brolio. </p> <p>But be warned. Tasting Chiantis can be a minefield. Come upon a Castello di Ama or Cacchiano and you'll discover some of the most wonderful wines to come from grapes anywhere, but unfortunately there are some very poor producers too. </p> <p><strong> The address:</strong> C'Era Una Volta, Via Certaldese 11, Lucardo village, Montespertoli, Tuscany. Tel: 0039 0571 669162. Closed Tuesdays. </p> <p>Only half an hour's drive from Florence, the tiny hilltop hamlet of Lucardo is surrounded by vineyards. The one shop, C'Era Una Volta, doubles as a grocery and cafi, as well as drawing gourmets to its restaurant. A great choice of reasonably priced Chiantis complements typical Tuscan dishes such as pappardelle pasta served with wild boar and a heaped plate of fritto - deep-fried chicken, lamb and vegetables. </p> <p><strong> 7 Gewurtztraminer</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The region:</strong> Meet an Italian in the mountains of Alto Adige and he'll greet you with gruss gott instead of salute. Noble medieval towns such as Bolzano and Bressanone are known more by their Germanic names of Bolzen and Brixen, and the locals prefer roast pork and sauerkraut to pasta. Welcome to the Italian Tyrol, a semi-autonomous region of splendid Alpine scenery, fairytale castles and onion-domed churches. </p> <p><strong> The wine:</strong> Precariously fastened along steep mountain sides, the vineyards are some of the most beautiful in Italy, and produce wines of the highest quality. Gewurtztraminer is a name more commonly associated with a fruity, aromatic wine from Alsace, but the climatic and soil conditions here produce a much dryer version. Visit the picturesque village of Margreid, and you'll discover the cantina of the region's greatest winemaker, Alois Lageder. </p> <p><strong> The address: </strong> Hilber Keller, Caines village, Merano, Alto Adige. Tel: 0039 0473 241017. Closed Wednesdays and from December to February. </p> <p>High up in a spectacular glacial valley, this centuries-old wine cellar is hewn into the mountainside and in summer it has a huge, sunny terrace with a panoramic view over the vineyards. The jovial innkeeper serves carafes of local wine, and in autumn there is the turggelen season of roasted chesnuts and speck , or savoury smoked ham. </p> <p><strong> 8 Franciacorta</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The region:</strong> Lombardy is the region of the great lakes for tourists, despite having at its heart Milan, the commercial and fashion capital of Italy. It stretches from the shores of Lake Maggiore, Como, Iseo and Garda. And for a break from boating and bathing, just jump in the car and head for the fabled Renaissance city of Mantova, delightfully quiet and off the normal tourist track. </p> <p><strong> The wine:</strong> Lombardy has lagged behind much of Italy in upgrading the quality of its wine, with the notable exception of Franciacorta, which you'll find in both a white, Pinot Bianco version, and red, predominantly Cabernet Franc. Even more surprising is Franciacorta Gran Cuvie Brut of the excellent Ca' del Bosco cantina, in Erbusco, which is an outstanding sparkling wine to rival any champagne. </p> <p><strong> The address:</strong> Osteria dell'Orologio, Via Butturini 26, Salr, Lombardy. Tel: 0039 0365 290158. Closed Wednesdays. </p> <p>With a wine bar on the ground floor and a restaurant upstairs, you can choose to just taste a wide selection of Franciacorta wines, or to feast off the excellent freshwater fish caught in Lake Garda - including carp, pike and perch. The resorts alongside the lake are known as the Garda Riviera, and Salr itself is famous as the site of the dictator Benito Mussolini's short-lived last Republic before his final capture as Italy and Germany were defeated in the Second World War. </p> <p><strong> 9 Lambrusco</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The region:</strong> Emilia-Romagna lies unknown to most tourists who flock instead to Tuscany and Umbria, but it is just as attractive in its own way. Bologna and Parma are not just interesting as classic sightseeing destinations, they're actually fun university towns, with great restaurants and bars. Ravenna, for its mosaics, and the grand palaces of Ferrara, are both worth a detour, while behind travel brochure images of modern hotels lining the seafront, Rimini and the whole Adriatic coast boast some of Europe's wildest summer nightclubs. </p> <p><strong> The wine:</strong> Love it or hate it, the sparkling red Lambrusco is so different from other wines that it leaves no one unmoved. What is sure, though, is that here in the region it is grown, this is the perfect wine to accompany the characteristic cuisine of what is Italy's gastronomic heartland. Although some wine makers produce a sweeter, amabile Lambrusco, it is better to stick to the dry variation. </p> <p><strong> The address: </strong> Trattoria Il Lurido, Piazzetta Ortaggi 7, Rimini, Emilia Romagna. Tel: 0039 0541 24834. Closed Tues. </p> <p>Foodies are spoilt for choice in Emilia-Romagna, with Parma famous for its ham, Bologna for mortadella, parmesan cheese from Reggio, and Modena's renowned basalmic vinegar. Best of all, though, is the fresh pasta - tagliatelle and tortelloni - and there's no better place to sample that than in Fellini's favourite restaurant in his home town of Rimini. They don't have the best wine list in the world, but you'll taste a fine chilled bottle of Lambrusco. </p> <p><strong> 10 Tokai Friulano</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The region:</strong> Friuli makes up Italy's wild and rugged border with Eastern and Central Europe. Not many foreign travellers make it out this far, even though the elegant Venice is close. It is their loss, because historic towns such as Udine and Cividale, the dreamy lagoon at Grado, and the lush valleys and towering mountains of the Carnia lie totally unspoilt, waiting to be discovered. </p> <p><strong> The wine: </strong> To really discover the cutting edge of great Italian wines, it is well worth the trek to Friuli. The whites are stupendous - Chardonnay, Sauvignon, Malvasia - and in red wine, both the Cabernet and Merlot can be excellent. But the Friulani are most proud of their Tokai, and the dialect word for a glass of wine, tajut, always refers to a Tokai. </p> <p>Banish all thoughts of the sickly sweet Hungarian Tokay. The Friuli version is a delicate dry white wine, which becomes great in the hands of master vintners such as Livio Felluga and Sandro Princic, both in the Collio vineyards. </p> <p><strong> The address:</strong> Enoteca di Cormons, Piazza XXIV, Maggio 21, Cormons, Friuli. Tel: 0039 0481 630371. Closed Tuesdays. </p> <p>The village of Cormons is the unofficial wine capital of Friuli, and there is plenty of choice to have a lunchtime break between visiting different vineyards. </p> <p>There are several rather smart restaurants, which are much favoured by wine makers entertaining customers, but the most sensible spot to head for is the town's official enoteca, where there is a vast selection of all the great wines of the surrounding Collio hills, which can be accompanied by bar snacks such as the local prosciutto crudo, salami and cheeses.</p>",

This rich, heady wine takes its name from the port of Marsala, but the most scenic place to visit vineyards is around Agrigento, which has one of the finest Greek temples outside Athens. The address: Hosteria dei Vesperi, Piazza Croce dei Vesperi 6, Palermo, Sicily. Tel: 0039 091 6171631. Closed Sundays. Smack in the historic centre of the pulsating city of Palermo, this osteria specialises in both Sicilian wines and traditional cuisine. Some of the greatest new wines in Italy are being made in Sicily now, especially Chardonnay and Nero d'Avola, a Syrah-like grape. Try them accompanied by a classic pasta con sarde, or spaghetti with fresh sardines, pine nuts and wild fennel. 3 Barolo The region: Piedmont is not simply next to France geographically but culturally too. Driving through the vine-covered hills of the Langhe and the truffle-filled forests around Alba has a feel similar to exploring Burgundy. Don't neglect to visit the region's dynamic capital, Turin, which will host the next Winter Olympics, and is refreshingly untouristy. The wine: Barolo can quite simply be called the king of Italian red wines, an outstanding full-bodied wine that, like a Bordeaux, needs to age for several years for it to lose its hard tannic taste. Unfortunately, it is also seriously expensive, especially if you decide to taste some of the more renowned producers such as Gaja, Pio Cesare and the grandly-named Marchesi di Barolo. The address: Boccondivino, Via Mendicita Istruita 14, Bra, Piedmont. Tel: 0039 0172 425674. Closed Sunday Bra is home to the renowned Italian wine and food movement, Slow Food, so it's no surprise that the town's local enoteca stocks over 150 different types of Barolo in its cellar. Don't neglect some of the other excellent Piedmont vintages such as Barbaresco, Barbera and Dolcetto. They are perfect with a traditional bagna cauda, a delicious vegetable fondue based on anchovies and garlic. 4 Frascati The region: Latium, the ancient area known in Italy as Lazio, is dominated by the national capital, Rome, and few tourists explore further than the Eternal City. Apart from interesting Etruscan remains around Tarquinia and Cerveteri, there is one of Italy's best-hidden secrets waiting to be discovered, the idyllic island of Ponza. The wine: Sit down at any restaurant in Rome and you can be sure that the vino di tavola will be a carafe of fresh, light Frascati. Grown in pretty vineyards less than 20 miles south of the capital, this is by no means the greatest white wine in Italy. But on a hot summer's day, sitting out on a sunny terrace, enjoying a bottle of one of the superiore vintages, especially from the cantina of Count Zandotti, can be unforgettable. The address: Ristorante del Pallaro, Largo del Pallaro 15, Rome, Lazio. Tel: 0039 06 68801488. Closed Sundays. A delightful dose of La Dolce Vita is guaranteed at this friendly old-fashioned trattoria, just by Rome's famed Piazza Navona. There there is no menu, just a steady stream of dishes prepared by La Mamma in the kitchen, from antipasti right through to dessert, with a chilled bottle of Frascati in the middle of the table. 5 Orvieto The region: Umbria is a close rival to its neighbour, Tuscany, for dramatic country landscapes and perfectly preserved medieval and Renaissance towns. The crowds may flock to the renowned sights of Giotto's frescoes at Assisi and the cavernous Gothic cathedral in Orvieto, but you'll find the rest of the region much more peaceful, especially around Lake Trasemino, which is great for fishing and swimming. It is worth noting two major festivals, for arts, music and film in July and August at Spoleto, and an irresistible chocolate festival in Perugia in October. The wine: Although Umbria is trying to follow Tuscany's lead in producing a new range of superior red wines, the internationally popular white Orvieto still accounts for 80 per cent of all the wine produced here, and there are some very different levels of quality. The Etruscans began making wine in Umbria more than 2,000 years ago, and over the centuries Orvieto has been transformed from a light, sweet wine into today's dry, straw-coloured variety. The address: I Sette Consoli, Piazza Sant'Angelo 1, Orvieto, Umbria. Tel: 0039 0763 343911. Closed Wednesdays. With coachloads of tourists flocking to the town of Orvieto, there are plenty of rip-off places selling poor-quality, expensive local wine. The Seven Consuls, though, is a serious gastronomic restaurant with an equally serious wine list to sample some of the better Orvieto producers. 6 Chianti The region: Tuscany is most people's dream destination in Italy, but images of opulent villas and wealthy expats sitting by the pool in 'Chiantishire' are a long way from the real picture. Outside the great cities of Florence, Pisa and Sienna, Tuscany is essentially a very rural community, and behind the serene lines of cypress trees atop rolling hills it doesn't take long to find quiet villages and friendly agroturismo guest houses unspoilt by tourism. The wine: Enthusiasts will tell you that Tuscany's most respected wines today are Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, but it is Chianti that is known throughout the world. Claiming to be the world's oldest officially defined wine-producing area, dating from a 1716 decree, the unique taste of Chianti was developed by Baron Bettino Ricasoli in the early nineteenth century, and it is still worth visiting his castle and vineyards in Brolio. But be warned. Tasting Chiantis can be a minefield. Come upon a Castello di Ama or Cacchiano and you'll discover some of the most wonderful wines to come from grapes anywhere, but unfortunately there are some very poor producers too. The address: C'Era Una Volta, Via Certaldese 11, Lucardo village, Montespertoli, Tuscany. Tel: 0039 0571 669162. Closed Tuesdays. Only half an hour's drive from Florence, the tiny hilltop hamlet of Lucardo is surrounded by vineyards. The one shop, C'Era Una Volta, doubles as a grocery and cafi, as well as drawing gourmets to its restaurant. A great choice of reasonably priced Chiantis complements typical Tuscan dishes such as pappardelle pasta served with wild boar and a heaped plate of fritto - deep-fried chicken, lamb and vegetables. 7 Gewurtztraminer The region: Meet an Italian in the mountains of Alto Adige and he'll greet you with gruss gott instead of salute. Noble medieval towns such as Bolzano and Bressanone are known more by their Germanic names of Bolzen and Brixen, and the locals prefer roast pork and sauerkraut to pasta. Welcome to the Italian Tyrol, a semi-autonomous region of splendid Alpine scenery, fairytale castles and onion-domed churches. The wine: Precariously fastened along steep mountain sides, the vineyards are some of the most beautiful in Italy, and produce wines of the highest quality. Gewurtztraminer is a name more commonly associated with a fruity, aromatic wine from Alsace, but the climatic and soil conditions here produce a much dryer version. Visit the picturesque village of Margreid, and you'll discover the cantina of the region's greatest winemaker, Alois Lageder. The address: Hilber Keller, Caines village, Merano, Alto Adige. Tel: 0039 0473 241017. Closed Wednesdays and from December to February. High up in a spectacular glacial valley, this centuries-old wine cellar is hewn into the mountainside and in summer it has a huge, sunny terrace with a panoramic view over the vineyards. The jovial innkeeper serves carafes of local wine, and in autumn there is the turggelen season of roasted chesnuts and speck , or savoury smoked ham. 8 Franciacorta The region: Lombardy is the region of the great lakes for tourists, despite having at its heart Milan, the commercial and fashion capital of Italy. It stretches from the shores of Lake Maggiore, Como, Iseo and Garda. And for a break from boating and bathing, just jump in the car and head for the fabled Renaissance city of Mantova, delightfully quiet and off the normal tourist track. The wine: Lombardy has lagged behind much of Italy in upgrading the quality of its wine, with the notable exception of Franciacorta, which you'll find in both a white, Pinot Bianco version, and red, predominantly Cabernet Franc. Even more surprising is Franciacorta Gran Cuvie Brut of the excellent Ca' del Bosco cantina, in Erbusco, which is an outstanding sparkling wine to rival any champagne. The address: Osteria dell'Orologio, Via Butturini 26, Salr, Lombardy. Tel: 0039 0365 290158. Closed Wednesdays. With a wine bar on the ground floor and a restaurant upstairs, you can choose to just taste a wide selection of Franciacorta wines, or to feast off the excellent freshwater fish caught in Lake Garda - including carp, pike and perch. The resorts alongside the lake are known as the Garda Riviera, and Salr itself is famous as the site of the dictator Benito Mussolini's short-lived last Republic before his final capture as Italy and Germany were defeated in the Second World War. 9 Lambrusco The region: Emilia-Romagna lies unknown to most tourists who flock instead to Tuscany and Umbria, but it is just as attractive in its own way. Bologna and Parma are not just interesting as classic sightseeing destinations, they're actually fun university towns, with great restaurants and bars. Ravenna, for its mosaics, and the grand palaces of Ferrara, are both worth a detour, while behind travel brochure images of modern hotels lining the seafront, Rimini and the whole Adriatic coast boast some of Europe's wildest summer nightclubs. The wine: Love it or hate it, the sparkling red Lambrusco is so different from other wines that it leaves no one unmoved. What is sure, though, is that here in the region it is grown, this is the perfect wine to accompany the characteristic cuisine of what is Italy's gastronomic heartland. Although some wine makers produce a sweeter, amabile Lambrusco, it is better to stick to the dry variation. The address: Trattoria Il Lurido, Piazzetta Ortaggi 7, Rimini, Emilia Romagna. Tel: 0039 0541 24834. Closed Tues. Foodies are spoilt for choice in Emilia-Romagna, with Parma famous for its ham, Bologna for mortadella, parmesan cheese from Reggio, and Modena's renowned basalmic vinegar. Best of all, though, is the fresh pasta - tagliatelle and tortelloni - and there's no better place to sample that than in Fellini's favourite restaurant in his home town of Rimini. They don't have the best wine list in the world, but you'll taste a fine chilled bottle of Lambrusco. 10 Tokai Friulano The region: Friuli makes up Italy's wild and rugged border with Eastern and Central Europe. Not many foreign travellers make it out this far, even though the elegant Venice is close. It is their loss, because historic towns such as Udine and Cividale, the dreamy lagoon at Grado, and the lush valleys and towering mountains of the Carnia lie totally unspoilt, waiting to be discovered. The wine: To really discover the cutting edge of great Italian wines, it is well worth the trek to Friuli. The whites are stupendous - Chardonnay, Sauvignon, Malvasia - and in red wine, both the Cabernet and Merlot can be excellent. But the Friulani are most proud of their Tokai, and the dialect word for a glass of wine, tajut, always refers to a Tokai. Banish all thoughts of the sickly sweet Hungarian Tokay. The Friuli version is a delicate dry white wine, which becomes great in the hands of master vintners such as Livio Felluga and Sandro Princic, both in the Collio vineyards. The address: Enoteca di Cormons, Piazza XXIV, Maggio 21, Cormons, Friuli. Tel: 0039 0481 630371. Closed Tuesdays. The village of Cormons is the unofficial wine capital of Friuli, and there is plenty of choice to have a lunchtime break between visiting different vineyards. There are several rather smart restaurants, which are much favoured by wine makers entertaining customers, but the most sensible spot to head for is the town's official enoteca, where there is a vast selection of all the great wines of the surrounding Collio hills, which can be accompanied by bar snacks such as the local prosciutto crudo, salami and cheeses.",

No Marks and Sparks then. And Verdi didn't help. Seizing upon Victor Hugo's Le Roi s'amuse as a good plot for an opera, he dismayed the Venetian opera house management by portraying a French king as a libertine and subject of an assassination plot.

Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga spent lavishly on music, and employed Claudio Monteverdi as a court singer, instrumentalist and composer, and took him with him on military expeditions to the Danube and Flanders, presumably to soothe the troubled breast when the going got tough. The Oxford Dictionary of Music says that Monteverdi's place in the history of Renaissance music can justly be compared to Shakespeare's in literature.

That's the language working-class Geordie girl Angela Gobin says the toffs of Sandhurst used to freeze her out of the Royal Military Academy; she might easily have been describing Lord's and all its old prejudices. </p> <p>It would be unfair to characterise every administrator in the game as a Bufton-Tufton stuck in the last century (or the one before, for that matter) - indeed, Lord MacLaurin has tried his best to drag some of the dinosaurs out of the saloon bar and into the sunlight - but they did themselves no favours last week with their laughably unenforcable edicts on match-fixing. </p> <p>In essence, the wise men of the International Cricket Council expect the ranks to step forward and rat on their mates, thus cleaning up a mess that has sat festering under their noses for the best part of two decades. And then it's jankers all-round, apparently. </p> <p>This is a liar's charter, if ever there was one. The dressing-room culture of cricket almost guarantees that the players' first loyalty is to their colleagues; this, after all, is how the Establishment operates anyway. In its purest sense, it is masonic from top to bottom. So players will not be baring the souls to anonymous investigators and absolutely nothing will be unearthed that is not already known. </p> <p>There are two windows of opportunity open, however: the Qayyum report, which we are told will finally be made public this week, supposedly naming the Pakistani names we already have been reading about for months; and the Hansie Cronje investigation, which starts tomorrow in South Africa. Both of those have judicial weight. As does the police inquiry in Delhi that first accused Cronje and three (or four) of his team-mates of taking bribes.</p> <p>Cronje, whose love affair with the telephone has been suspended apparently (Allan Donald revealed last week he got through to his former captain's parents' house but Hansie would not come to the phone), will have to come out of hiding for this one. Will he be able to explain how the phone call he is alleged to have taken from the Indian bookmaker Sanjeev Chawla was taken on the mobile phone of the South African team manager, Goolam Raja - or will that little detail be quietly passed over? </p> <p>This is the fine print the ICC investigators will be hard-pressed to pin down without the total cooperation of the troops. And just how persuasive are the officers? </p> <p>MacLaurin (as you are allowed to call a peer after first use of his title) last week described Simon Pack, the international teams director of the England and Wales Cricket Board, as 'a first-rate officer'. No doubt that is so.

      "bodyText": "'Soldiers are from the north, officers from the south.' That's the language working-class Geordie girl Angela Gobin says the toffs of Sandhurst used to freeze her out of the Royal Military Academy; she might easily have been describing Lord's and all its old prejudices. It would be unfair to characterise every administrator in the game as a Bufton-Tufton stuck in the last century (or the one before, for that matter) - indeed, Lord MacLaurin has tried his best to drag some of the dinosaurs out of the saloon bar and into the sunlight - but they did themselves no favours last week with their laughably unenforcable edicts on match-fixing. In essence, the wise men of the International Cricket Council expect the ranks to step forward and rat on their mates, thus cleaning up a mess that has sat festering under their noses for the best part of two decades. And then it's jankers all-round, apparently. This is a liar's charter, if ever there was one. The dressing-room culture of cricket almost guarantees that the players' first loyalty is to their colleagues; this, after all, is how the Establishment operates anyway. In its purest sense, it is masonic from top to bottom. So players will not be baring the souls to anonymous investigators and absolutely nothing will be unearthed that is not already known. There are two windows of opportunity open, however: the Qayyum report, which we are told will finally be made public this week, supposedly naming the Pakistani names we already have been reading about for months; and the Hansie Cronje investigation, which starts tomorrow in South Africa. Both of those have judicial weight. As does the police inquiry in Delhi that first accused Cronje and three (or four) of his team-mates of taking bribes. Cronje, whose love affair with the telephone has been suspended apparently (Allan Donald revealed last week he got through to his former captain's parents' house but Hansie would not come to the phone), will have to come out of hiding for this one. Will he be able to explain how the phone call he is alleged to have taken from the Indian bookmaker Sanjeev Chawla was taken on the mobile phone of the South African team manager, Goolam Raja - or will that little detail be quietly passed over? This is the fine print the ICC investigators will be hard-pressed to pin down without the total cooperation of the troops. And just how persuasive are the officers? MacLaurin (as you are allowed to call a peer after first use of his title) last week described Simon Pack, the international teams director of the England and Wales Cricket Board, as 'a first-rate officer'. No doubt that is so. But, if the players are to believed, when they were desperate to talk with Pack last year over central contracts, they were told he could not go out to Sharjah to meet them because he was busy working on his garden. It is to be hoped his roses are blooming. We may be doing MacLaurin and Pack a disservice. Theirs is a tough job, and they're probably doing their best. But, if it is not good enough - and if the ICC are failing in their duty as guardians of the sport worldwide - surely we are led to the conclusion that somebody else could do it better. The view that there is a cultural gap between the rulers and ruled was given voice in a conversation I had last week with someone close to the Pakistan team who objects to the way the old order have rushed to several assumptions about cricket in Asia. He reminded me that, when England's cricketers arrive in Karachi in October to start their first tour of Pakistan since Mike Gatting waved his finger at Shakoor Rana 13 years ago, you can bet - sorry, be reasonably certain - that the welcoming committee will have plenty to say off the record to their guests. Not much of it will be about old umpiring decisions; there are plenty of new arguments to be going on with. 'What a lot of these people are slow to realise,' he said, 'is that the power in cricket has shifted. If the general view is that corruption is concentrated in south Asia because of the proliferation of one-day games there - and what other conclusion could you draw from last week's meeting at Lord's? - perhaps the establishment figures should ask themselves why that is the case.

      "body": "<p>You sit at your desk, park your coffee next to your mouse, fire up your computer and click to check your e-mail. And in that one tiny movement, before you have even looked to see if there are any suspicious messages from 'NastyVirus.com', it could be too late.</p> <p>Just by clicking on your 'Get Mail' you could have turned your \u00a32,000 machine into a pile of useless plastic. It is every computer user's worst nightmare - and it is coming soon to a screen near you. Brace yourself for the supervirus.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the 'love bug' has given us all a taste of what could be coming. Though its creator - the only names released by investigators so far are Barok or Spyder - must be concerned about the police knocking on his door within hours, he must also be feeling fairly pleased with himself. The virus he set loose on the world on Thursday has already caused up to \u00a31 billion worth of damage, more than any other virus or hacking attack since the dawn of cyber-history.</p> <p>His program worked because it was simple. It was posted on the Web 10 days ago, almost certainly from a computer operating in Manila, capital of the Philippines. It lay dormant for nearly a week before surfacing on computer screens in Hong Kong. The message - seemingly sent by someone known to the computer user - said 'ILOVEYOU' and had an attachment which appeared to be a love letter.</p> <p>But it was no billet doux. Launching the attachment allowed a program to invade the computer which not only sent copies of the e-mail to all the addresses listed on the machine but also scooped up all the passwords it could find and sent them back to the creator of the bug.</p> <p>Those first clicks - at around 8am local time on Thursday - triggered a flood. Billions of pulses raced through the world's phone lines, spattering the virus in all directions. It was the fastest-spreading bug ever, infecting five million machines within 36 hours. Everyone from the Pentagon to the House of Commons to New Zealand universities was hit. An estimated 20 per cent of the world's computers were affected and half of all machines in the UK.</p> <p>Yet it could have been an awful lot worse. The love bug worked by proliferating at such a rate that Internet systems could not handle the overload. That may cause temporary collapse, but there is little long-term damage. The damage that this bug - technically known as a worm - did to picture and music files did cause problems, but these were far from catastrophic.</p> <p>Cyber-sabotage of a more deadly kind by was indicated by a development in November when researchers at Network Associates, an American computer security firm, received a series of e-mails with the subject heading 'Bubbleboy is back!'. As they examined the virus their eyes widened. It was, says Vincent Gullotto, director of the company's anti-virus team, 'a watershed'.</p> <p>The Bubbleboy virus broke the long-standing rule that you have to open an e-mail attachment to become infected. By the time it was in your inbox it was too late.</p> <p>Thankfully Bubbleboy, though it e-mailed itself to everyone in a computer's address book, did not have a 'destructive payload' and so did little damage. Few took much notice of the quantum leap that it represented.</p> <p>And virus writers have made advances in other areas. In April last year a virus called Chernobyl was activated in hundreds of thousands of computers in Asia and the Middle East, striking on the anniversary of the nuclear accident it was named after. Not only did it wipe out stored data, it destroyed BIOS - the basic instructions that tell a machine how to start.</p> <p>Now, The Observer has learned, virus writers have married the destructive capabilities of Chernobyl, with the invasive capabilities of Bubbleboy and the speed of the Love Bug. The combination is the supervirus.</p> <p>According to anti-virus experts, at least 50 such superviruses have already been detected on the Internet. None have yet been launched at the public. Some may not work; some may be shot down by existing virus defences; some might get through. And that is the nightmare scenario.</p> <p>A hacker known as Dark Tangent, who heads a group which advises big businesses on their security, says the only surprise is that a 'supervirus hasn't happened yet'. 'For the last two years we've all been waiting. I don't know why we have not seen one. It could happen next week.'</p> <p>The damage a successful supervirus could do is almost incalculable. 'It would be as if the Millennium Bug has actually done everything it was feared it could do,' said one London-based computer security expert last week.</p> <p>The first question confronting law enforcement agencies and commercial outfits hired to protect companies and institutions against such an attack is who would be likely to launch it. Authorities are focusing on the threat from terrorist groups, who they fear might use viruses to extort money or blackmail governments into giving in to political demands.</p> <p>It would be relatively easy for a group to launch a virus against a specific set of targets - maybe one institution or a single ministry - and then threaten to release further e-mails elsewhere. Such actions could paralyse the workings of a government while avoiding killing innocent people.</p> <p>One source close to British intelligence services says MI5 believe both the Basque separatist group ETA and the Kurdish terror organisations have drawn up plans aimed at crashing air traffic control systems through the use of hacking or viruses. Irish Republican terrorists are also thought to have considered similar methods. 'The supervirus is going to happen soon,' the source said. 'There are people out there with that intention. They may coincide their actions with protests against the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation, just to muddy the water.' Many of the organisations connected with anarchist violence in London number hackers in their ranks.</p> <p>Another threat is from hostile governments. The US defence department believes 120 countries pose a serious threat to cyber-security. They include Libya, Iraq, Croatia and Serbia. The Chinese are thought to have created military regiments dedicated to cyber-warfare.</p> <p>Experts say national security authorities are only just waking up to the threat from the Internet - a threat that will be magnified when technology allows e-mails to be read on mobile phone-type units. Critics say British authorities have yet to establish an effective, single body to deal with the threat.</p> <p>Policing of the Internet is at present the responsibility of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) and a computer crimes squad at Scotland Yard. MI5, Customs and Special Branch also have an interest.</p> <p>'There is a turf war between these agencies,' said Caspar Bowden, director of the Foundation for Information Policy and Research. 'The Government's entire strategy for policing information technology is in disarray.'</p> <p>Critics say a new \u00a325m system which will monitor e-mail and Internet surfing across the UK endangers civil liberties and will be impotent against serious criminals.</p> <p>Many experts also say the security agencies are looking in the wrong place. Mike Bluestone, director of Berkeley Security Bureau, said those who launch virus attacks are more likely to be 'cyber-vandals' not 'cyber-terrorists'. 'Terrorists make targeted demands and like a high degree of control over their operations. A supervirus is more likely to be the brainchild of a spotty adolescent than some terrorist mastermind.'</p> <p>The standard profile of a virus writer is a young man with a grievance. He is often a professional programmer who feels his skills are not being recognised. Hidden behind a series of fake and anonymous e-mail accounts the virus writer is rarely detectable.</p> <p>But this weekend investigators seemed confident they were close to catching the man behind the love bug. Nelson Bartoleme, head of the Manila police anti-fraud and computer crimes division, told reporters his agents had placed a suspect, believed to be a 23-year-old man living in a wealthy Manila suburb, under surveillance.</p> <p>The arrest of one young man on the other side of the world may seem scant consolation if you are still smarting from last week's attack, but you should take heart. Just remember, as your fingers dip towards your mouse tomorrow morning and the cursor starts its glide towards the inbox icon - it could have been an awful lot worse.

      "bodyText": "You sit at your desk, park your coffee next to your mouse, fire up your computer and click to check your e-mail. And in that one tiny movement, before you have even looked to see if there are any suspicious messages from 'NastyVirus.com', it could be too late. Just by clicking on your 'Get Mail' you could have turned your \u00a32,000 machine into a pile of useless plastic. It is every computer user's worst nightmare - and it is coming soon to a screen near you. Brace yourself for the supervirus. Meanwhile, the 'love bug' has given us all a taste of what could be coming. Though its creator - the only names released by investigators so far are Barok or Spyder - must be concerned about the police knocking on his door within hours, he must also be feeling fairly pleased with himself. The virus he set loose on the world on Thursday has already caused up to \u00a31 billion worth of damage, more than any other virus or hacking attack since the dawn of cyber-history. His program worked because it was simple. It was posted on the Web 10 days ago, almost certainly from a computer operating in Manila, capital of the Philippines. It lay dormant for nearly a week before surfacing on computer screens in Hong Kong. The message - seemingly sent by someone known to the computer user - said 'ILOVEYOU' and had an attachment which appeared to be a love letter. But it was no billet doux. Launching the attachment allowed a program to invade the computer which not only sent copies of the e-mail to all the addresses listed on the machine but also scooped up all the passwords it could find and sent them back to the creator of the bug. Those first clicks - at around 8am local time on Thursday - triggered a flood. Billions of pulses raced through the world's phone lines, spattering the virus in all directions. It was the fastest-spreading bug ever, infecting five million machines within 36 hours. Everyone from the Pentagon to the House of Commons to New Zealand universities was hit. An estimated 20 per cent of the world's computers were affected and half of all machines in the UK. Yet it could have been an awful lot worse. The love bug worked by proliferating at such a rate that Internet systems could not handle the overload. That may cause temporary collapse, but there is little long-term damage. The damage that this bug - technically known as a worm - did to picture and music files did cause problems, but these were far from catastrophic. Cyber-sabotage of a more deadly kind by was indicated by a development in November when researchers at Network Associates, an American computer security firm, received a series of e-mails with the subject heading 'Bubbleboy is back!'. As they examined the virus their eyes widened. It was, says Vincent Gullotto, director of the company's anti-virus team, 'a watershed'. The Bubbleboy virus broke the long-standing rule that you have to open an e-mail attachment to become infected. By the time it was in your inbox it was too late. Thankfully Bubbleboy, though it e-mailed itself to everyone in a computer's address book, did not have a 'destructive payload' and so did little damage. Few took much notice of the quantum leap that it represented. And virus writers have made advances in other areas. In April last year a virus called Chernobyl was activated in hundreds of thousands of computers in Asia and the Middle East, striking on the anniversary of the nuclear accident it was named after. Not only did it wipe out stored data, it destroyed BIOS - the basic instructions that tell a machine how to start. Now, The Observer has learned, virus writers have married the destructive capabilities of Chernobyl, with the invasive capabilities of Bubbleboy and the speed of the Love Bug. The combination is the supervirus. According to anti-virus experts, at least 50 such superviruses have already been detected on the Internet. None have yet been launched at the public. Some may not work; some may be shot down by existing virus defences; some might get through. And that is the nightmare scenario. A hacker known as Dark Tangent, who heads a group which advises big businesses on their security, says the only surprise is that a 'supervirus hasn't happened yet'. 'For the last two years we've all been waiting. I don't know why we have not seen one. It could happen next week.' The damage a successful supervirus could do is almost incalculable. 'It would be as if the Millennium Bug has actually done everything it was feared it could do,' said one London-based computer security expert last week. The first question confronting law enforcement agencies and commercial outfits hired to protect companies and institutions against such an attack is who would be likely to launch it. Authorities are focusing on the threat from terrorist groups, who they fear might use viruses to extort money or blackmail governments into giving in to political demands. It would be relatively easy for a group to launch a virus against a specific set of targets - maybe one institution or a single ministry - and then threaten to release further e-mails elsewhere. Such actions could paralyse the workings of a government while avoiding killing innocent people. One source close to British intelligence services says MI5 believe both the Basque separatist group ETA and the Kurdish terror organisations have drawn up plans aimed at crashing air traffic control systems through the use of hacking or viruses. Irish Republican terrorists are also thought to have considered similar methods. 'The supervirus is going to happen soon,' the source said. 'There are people out there with that intention. They may coincide their actions with protests against the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation, just to muddy the water.' Many of the organisations connected with anarchist violence in London number hackers in their ranks. Another threat is from hostile governments. The US defence department believes 120 countries pose a serious threat to cyber-security. They include Libya, Iraq, Croatia and Serbia. The Chinese are thought to have created military regiments dedicated to cyber-warfare. Experts say national security authorities are only just waking up to the threat from the Internet - a threat that will be magnified when technology allows e-mails to be read on mobile phone-type units. Critics say British authorities have yet to establish an effective, single body to deal with the threat. Policing of the Internet is at present the responsibility of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) and a computer crimes squad at Scotland Yard. MI5, Customs and Special Branch also have an interest. 'There is a turf war between these agencies,' said Caspar Bowden, director of the Foundation for Information Policy and Research. 'The Government's entire strategy for policing information technology is in disarray.' Critics say a new \u00a325m system which will monitor e-mail and Internet surfing across the UK endangers civil liberties and will be impotent against serious criminals. Many experts also say the security agencies are looking in the wrong place. Mike Bluestone, director of Berkeley Security Bureau, said those who launch virus attacks are more likely to be 'cyber-vandals' not 'cyber-terrorists'. 'Terrorists make targeted demands and like a high degree of control over their operations. A supervirus is more likely to be the brainchild of a spotty adolescent than some terrorist mastermind.' The standard profile of a virus writer is a young man with a grievance. He is often a professional programmer who feels his skills are not being recognised. Hidden behind a series of fake and anonymous e-mail accounts the virus writer is rarely detectable. But this weekend investigators seemed confident they were close to catching the man behind the love bug. Nelson Bartoleme, head of the Manila police anti-fraud and computer crimes division, told reporters his agents had placed a suspect, believed to be a 23-year-old man living in a wealthy Manila suburb, under surveillance. The arrest of one young man on the other side of the world may seem scant consolation if you are still smarting from last week's attack, but you should take heart. Just remember, as your fingers dip towards your mouse tomorrow morning and the cursor starts its glide towards the inbox icon - it could have been an awful lot worse. And one day, undoubtedly, it will be. Additional research: Peter Warren Click here for global chaos Social mayhem Home computers would be shut down and many essential services would suffer a catastrophic loss of data. Terrorism In the worst scenario, either through negligence or sabotage, a supervirus could infect air traffic control. Commercial crime Criminals could blackmail financial institutions, which would be anxious to avoid the costly damage a supervirus could cause their systems, their company's performance and their share value. How to sabotage the world 1. Download a virus writing programme from the Internet, which can enable anyone to author a virus. 2. Download an e-mail harvester which will search the Net for e-mail addresses and collect up to 25,000 addresses in an hour. 3. Find a series of Internet Service Providers in foreign countries through which to send your e-mails without being traced. 4. Create a message and e-mail it to the randomly generated addresses, plus any specific organisations you wish to target. 5. Send the virus off and watch global chaos ensue.",

Liz is pregnant - and due to give birth after Madonna but before the turn of the year. And, as pregnant women are wont to do, she decided to reassess the future. Rather than giving up on the television industry altogether, she is leaving to set up her own production company, which will generate content for both television and new media ventures. </p> <p>It is lamentable that the TV industry is losing one of its highest-placed and highest-profile women executives. But then the Murdoch moniker guarantees, if nothing else, an ongoing interest in any of your doings. Settled now in the UK with her partner, PR man Matthew Freud, the lack of a role at Sky will not necessarily dim interest in her public or private activities. </p> <p>When she told BSkyB chief executive Tony Ball nine days ago that she was leaving, his reaction was one of genuine regret but not total surprise. 'We had an extremely good working relationship, and we were very much singing from the same hymn sheet on what we were trying to achieve for the channels - more original and better programming,' says Ball. </p> <p>According to colleagues of the pair at Sky, these are not just warm words: Murdoch's relationship with Ball was markedly better than with either of his predecessors, Mark Booth and Sam Chisholm. And it seems entirely possible that Liz Murdoch's new company will crop up as a potential supplier to Sky. </p> <p>Equally, says Ball, the fact that Elisabeth has left Sky does not dent the broadcaster's relationship with its News Corp proprietor: 'I don't necessarily agree that Liz going lessens our perception as a News Corp company, and I'm sure that Mr Murdoch's interest in what we are doing will not be diminished either.' </p> <p>What it does mean is that there will not, for the foreseeable future, be a Murdoch at the top of Sky, but then the appointment of Ball just over a year ago, was seen as confirmation of this. </p> <p>With 62 per cent of Sky shares in the hands of other investors and with its own stock market quotation, to have placed a family member in the top slot would always have been questionable in the eyes of the City, whatever their merits. </p> <p>The fact that Murdoch's departure was made for personal reasons and of her own volition appears clear cut. She is unlikely to be replaced, in title at least, as managing director of Sky Networks. </p> <p>Ball says: 'Since I arrived, I've done quite a lot of restructuring, and while we obviously have good people who will look after the programming side, I don't think I'll be looking for a straight replacement for Liz.' </p> <p>But Murdoch's departure also comes at a challenging time for the company. Next week the f-word raises its ugly head - bids for the next lot of TV rights to Premiership football have to be submitted by 10 May. </p> <p>Sky is just one of 74 parties who have requested the tender document, and whoever else bids will be hell bent on spoiling its monopoly over top football. </p> <p>It is not a subject Ball either can or will discuss. It seems unlikely that with more than 3 million homes now receiving Sky through digital dishes, the complex new package of Premiership rights will entirely leave the company, but its monopoly over screening fixtures is likely to come to an end. </p> <p>In addition, News Corp is busy rearranging its satellite TV portfolio into one company, which it has hinted it will float off in order to unlock its value. Sky's position in this spin-off could be crucial, in that it is by far the most successful pay-TV operation within the overall News Corp operation. </p> <p>Fox chief Peter Chernin will make an announcement within the next three months as to how the deal will be structured. The most likely outcome for Sky is that News Corp's stake in the company will be warehoused in the new company, but again the impact on Sky's destiny will be minimised. </p> <p>Instead, Ball is focusing on what will happen next. BSkyB's progression to digital is going well: the third-quarter results are likely to reveal that the company has around 3.5 million digital viewers. And, says Ball, its target of 5 million in five years target is entirely achievable, though he also hints that Sky will eventually move away from being a company tied to doing dishes. </p> <p>'I think it's inevitable that we are moving towards platform neutrality. We've experimented with ADSL [the new telephone technology] which is one way into the future, and there are others. But it is the general opinion that what the industry will be about is offering as much to your customers as possible,' he says. </p> <p>However rivalry in the television industry is not yet dead. Ball says of Sky's main rival, OnDigital: 'I can see its attractions for some people, but they are still very constrained by what they can offer and they have an uphill struggle to get to the 2 million subscribers they originally needed to break even.' </p> <p>Ball's next Big Decision, once the painful process of bidding for football is over, is what to do about switching off the analogue Sky signal. He says he will decide next year; the most likely option seems to be to dish the old satellite system as soon as possible. </p> <p>'We are finding that digital customers do on the whole spend more than analogue customers. They are more frequent users of the pay-per- view services, for instance, and they seem prepared to pay more for the extended choice,' says Ball. </p> <p>So is he happy with the programming line-up of the station? 'I'm never happy - if I were happy I wouldn't be doing this job. Things can always be better but I think the commitment Liz and I both had to air both the best of imported programming and to spend more on originated programming remains and is stronger than ever.' </p> <p>Ball told the Royal Television Society recently that the landmark UK-made drama The Strangerers, which Sky commissioned, was something which 'didn't quite work'. That was 'not necessarily what I meant to say, but the point is that every schedule is always work in progress.

'The children get one-to-one contact and they have huge resources at their disposal. The advantages of home education are so huge that if the parents are properly committed, it cannot fail.'</p> <p>According to Eileen Wilson, 'informal spokesperson' for Education Otherwise, there are 25,000 British families educating their own children - and the number is growing. The movement is even stronger in Canada, Australia and the United States. It even exists in countries where it is forbidden (Spain and Holland) or discouraged (Germany and Sweden). It is not, she insists, an 'anti-authority thing'.</p> <p>Wilson says: 'School suits some children very well, but it doesn't suit everyone.' There is no such thing as a typical home-educating parent. 'We have the whole caboodle. We've got a duchess, and lawyers, solicitors and doctors, and we've got gypsies.'</p> <p>In choosing to educate their children at home, they are exercising a right that most parents do not even know they have. The Education Act 1996 requires that the 'parent of every child of compulsory school age shall cause him to receive efficient full-time education suitable (a) to his age, ability, and aptitude, and (b) to any special educational needs he may have, either by regular attendance at school or otherwise.'</p> <p>In other words, it is a parent's responsibility to make sure a child gets a proper education, but it is also up to parents to decide what shape that education takes. They do not have to seek permission to educate at home. Although they will probably be inspected once a year, they do not have to be in regular touch with the local education authority and they do not have to have degrees or qualifications. They do not have to follow the National Curriculum, observe the school year, follow a fixed timetable, give formal lessons, or make detailed plans in advance. However, many home-educating parents do.</p> <p>Almost always, the decision to educate at home begins with what you might call a 'school trauma'. A child starts falling to pieces, and the school either fails to help or refuses to admit a problem exists. Things fell apart for Lucy Woodroffe's daughter, Alice, when she was in her second year at a village infant school. She was in a class of 20 boys and only six girls with a teacher in his first job, and she got lost in the shuffle.</p> <p>'Every morning, I had to peel her arms off my neck,' Woodroffe recalls. 'At 3.15 I'd come back to a grey-faced child. She was disheartened, sidelined, and miserable. All my hard work building my lovely daughter was falling away.' So she deregistered her.</p> <p>Seven years on, she is still home-educating Alice and her younger sister, as well as three other children who live in the same idyllic valley just outside Bath. The children have three intense hours in the morning and then less structured lessons in Spanish, music, drama, and science in the afternoon. They work with eight different qualified teachers. The day I went to visit they were with their philosophy teacher, who was about to take three of them on a nature walk. 'He can also teach them about birds, trees, hedge-lanes, flyfishing, history, Chaucer, Keats and even the Communist Party, of which he was once a member.'</p> <p>It costs her about \u00a312,000 a year to keep it all going. She doesn't ask the other parents to pay anything unless they can afford it. All the children are performing well above the standards they would be held to if they were in a formal school - Alice, now 13, will probably take her GCSEs a year early. They try to stick to the school year - this is partly because one of the other mothers is a teacher at a highly-regarded private girl's school. She insists her decision to take her son out of school was not ideological, but practical.</p> <p>Home education suits him because 'he's a self-motivating boy who can sit down and draw for four or five hours and likes to write poems.' It would not, she thinks, suit his younger brother, 'who loves big social groups and parties and a busy lifestyle'.</p> <p>For Naomi Ellis, homeschooling began as a temporary solution to a problem. Her family moved from London to Washington when her son was five. She did not think much of the local schools and decided to try homeschooling after she made friends with another woman who was already doing it. This same woman was her entr\u00e9e to what turned out to be a vast and very unusual network. Some were schooling their children at home because they were fundamentalist Christians, others were from military backgrounds and rejected the school system because it did not require children to pledge allegiance to the flag.</p> <p>Others were new age or, like her, professionals-turned-stay-at-home mothers. There were so many of them that they organised excursions and special classes. There was also a support group for mothers, which she found very helpful - and missed a lot when her family moved back to London.</p> <p>In England there was not a big enough network but Ellis kept her son out of school for another year. Then she decided he was ready for formal education. If he's doing well, it is, she thinks, thanks to the grounding and the focused attention he got during two years he spent at home. 'I'm still not totally committed to the school system. Why should I be?'</p> <p>If state education were her only option, she'd have removed him from school again in a flash. 'The state schools are doing so badly that it's hard to see how parents could achieve less. All they have to do is leave the television off. Even if all the children do is study the patterns in the carpet, they'll learn more.'</p> <p>But for most home-educating parents in this country, questions of educational quality are secondary. Here we come to the ugly side of the story - Wilson says that in 99 cases out of a hundred, bullying makes parents take their children out of school.</p> <p>The picture gets even uglier when you talk to Chris Smith, who runs Educate, an online service for home-educating parents, and who has counselled many home-educating parents in distress. His worst story is about a school that told one mother it was illegal for her to take her child out of school following the suicide of that child's brother, who had been bullied.</p> <p>He has other stories about threatening inspectors, and education authorities that put home-educated children on the at-risk register. 'Most home-educating parents are worried that the right to educate their children will be taken away from them, so they do not like to stick their heads over the parapet.'</p> <p>Smith is more confident - why would they meddle with a group of people who are getting excellent results? He was positively poetic when he described his daughter, who is so curious about the world and so at ease with all age groups; he takes so much more pleasure in her education than she would if she had to plod through the National Curriculum.</p> <p>A proper education, says Lucy Woodroffe, should not be about turning children into obedient little soldiers, but teaching children to enjoy thinking, and to think independently to a high standard. Imposed standards and standardised tests reward narrow, rote thinking and so produce the opposite result. There are plenty of teachers who would agree with her.</p> <p>Every time I go to talk to my children's teachers, I hear about the little things they are struggling to do above the National Curriculum, to try to get the children 'to think across the disciplines'. But so long as they are in that system, they have no choice but to obey the rules. It's the same with parents.

      "byline": "Mark Morris",

      "body": "<p>There's something not very English about doing everything on the grandest possible scale. But film-maker Ridley Scott - 'the greatest visual stylist working today', according to fellow director Alan Parker - has never worried about doing things the English way. And the 'grandest possible scale' is the only way to describe Gladiator, his new film which boasts a sweet $100 million budget. </p> <p>Scott's epic, the first major Hollywood film about ancient Rome made in more than three decades, promises to be the biggest hit of the year. It's not subtle, but it is massively entertaining. Scott is an Englishman Hollywood loves. He has made three massively influential films: Alien, Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise, and is the walking refutation of Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's claim that the British are temperamentally unsuited to the aesthetics of film-making. (Directing aside, Scott is a producer, co-owner of Scott Free films and Shepperton Studios, and founder of the advertising production giant, Ridley Scott Associates.) </p> <p>David, now Lord, Puttnam, who produced Scott's first feature, The Duellists, has no time for those who think that Scott allows style to overpower content. 'I remember someone criticising Ridley, saying \"the images are too perfect\". It's a bit like saying to Rembrandt \"you paint too well\". In the end he has a tremendous eye. What do you do, deny it? Pretend you don't have it?' </p> <p>Despite the larger-than-life image - \u00a320 Monte Cristos, pricey cars, expansive offices - Scott says he enjoys the fact that his films are more famous than his face. 'I like it that way. I do what I do.' And he once said 'as an Englishman, I am aghast at emotional intensity'. He describes himself as 'introspective', especially when compared with his brother, Tony, the director of Top Gun and Tinseltown playboy who once had an affair with Bridget Neilsen. 'Ridley is not one to open up and let you know what he really thinks or feels,' according to Alan Parker. </p> <p>His private life - divorced, he now lives alone - remains largely under wraps. On the other hand, he mixes family and work. As well as nurturing his brother's career, his two sons and his daughter have followed him into the family business. Jake Scott made his feature debut with Plunkett and Macleane last year: the film shares a cinematographer and costume designer with Gladiator, and Jake made no attempt to hide his father's overwhelming influence. </p> <p>Ridley Scott was born in South Shields in 1937. His father, who had worked in shipping, had a good war, rising to acting-brigadier and staying on in the Army. Scott himself considered joining the Marines when he was 19 - 'I like organisation' - but his father told him to go to art school instead. 'I was good at art, drawing and painting. Obsessed by it at 11 and 12.' His mother loved the movies, taking him to see such films as Gilda and - crucially - Citizen Kane. (One of the many films Scott planned and failed to direct was RKO 281, about the making of Kane, a story Scott described as 'art against commerce'. Eventually, Scott produced a cut-price version for the upmarket HBO cable network.) </p> <p>After the war, the family lived in Germany before returning to the North-East: by the time he had done his A-levels, Scott had been to 10 schools. He went to the West Hartlepool College of Art and then to the Royal College of Art, where he made his first short film, Boy on a Bicycle, starring his younger brother, Tony, and his father. By the early Sixties he was working as a designer at the BBC, shifting to directing episodes of Z Cars and The Informer. But he felt restricted by television. </p> <p>He switched to advertising. 'It was my film school,' he has said. 'The opportunity of making commercials was tremendous. I was able to be the insane perfectionist, controlling all the elements in one neat capsule.' He quickly made a name for himself, and in 1967 founded Ridley Scott Associates, still one of the major forces in ad production. Taking his inspiration from the US, he changed the way commercials were made. 'Most commercials were directed by feature directors who didn't give a shit about advertising. They thought that there was no art, no craft, no skill. I was the first of a new batch of directors who were determined to make it a craft.' </p> <p>His main rival was Alan Parker. According to Tim Delaney, group chairman of advertising agency Leagas Delaney: 'If you had a dialogue thing you went to Alan, if you had a visual thing you went to Ridley. There were no other contenders.' Scott's nostalgic Hovis ads were classics, with feature-film production values. 'I always regarded commercials as films. It would irritate the ad agencies - it's a commercial and he's doing a feature, they'd say.' </p> <p>By the time Scott came to direct his first feature, at the comparatively late age of 39, he was already powerful and living in a seventeenth-century house in Gloucester. But it took him several years to get a viable feature project. He came close with Ronnie and Leo, a violent black comedy that was going to star Michael York. Since Scott had never made a comedy, there's something intriguing about the idea. </p> <p>Instead, he got his chance as an indirect consequence of Parker's success, as David Puttnam explains. 'I started working with Ridley to develop a couple of screenplays. We had what became The Duellists, and The Gunpowder Plot. Parker's Bugsy Malone was presented at Cannes and was an absolutely phenomenal success, and as I left the cinema the guy from Paramount, David Picker, said \"This is an extraordinary talent. Do you know anyone else like him?\" And I said, \"A chap called Ridley Scott.\" So he said, \"I'd like to meet him.\" </p> <p>'I went straight from the cinema, phoned Ridley at home, told him to jump on a plane first thing tomorrow morning. Lunchtime the following day we were on the beach - this is a Cannes story par excellence - making a deal. When we got to the crux of what film we were going to do (we had the two scripts) I said one will cost two million and one we can make for 1.2 million and Picker said, \"I'll take the cheaper one.\" We both nodded. Six months later we were making The Duellists.' </p> <p>Based on a Joseph Conrad story about two French officers who continue their personal fights throughout the Napoleonic wars, The Duellists set the tone for Scott's career: it looked stunning. The casting also showed Scott's ambitions: British stars Albert Finney and Edward Fox played supporting roles to Americans Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel. The film was well received at Cannes in 1977 but received only a seven-print release in the US. </p> <p>But Scott was determined not to languish in the art-house ghetto. By then, a generation of advertising-bred British directors was emerging, led by Parker and including Hugh Hudson (Chariots Of Fire ), Adrian Lyne ( Flashdance ) and - shortly afterwards - Tony Scott. David Puttnam oversaw their rise. 'They had a visual sense which was a significant step on from the generation before them. Don't forget that there was not much of a gap between them and the Tony Richardson-Karel Reisz generation. I think the films just looked more handsome, because they didn't come from a documentary tradition. One of the reasons I didn't carry on working with Ridley was because I had a hankering to make films that were more gritty: Midnight Express, The Killing Fields. He wanted to make Alien - I had no interest in science fiction. I think on balance he was right.' </p> <p>Scott has also said he had had no interest in science fiction before Star Wars, but his next two films fell into that bracket, and made his reputation. The first was Alien. Scott was drawn towards the film because 'the script was short, specific and unbelievably violent'. The design - by Swiss artist H.R. Giger - might have been the film's obvious strength, but Scott took great care to induce tension and fear amongst the cast, telling them as little as possible about the chest-burst scene and filming their shocked faces in one take. David Puttnam insists that Scott is much better director of actors than he is given credit for. He was very tough on Sigourney Weaver, but the film made her both a star and an icon. The film was a huge success. </p> <p> Blade Runner wasn't. Again, Scott's perfectionism - or obsessiveness - caused problems with the crew, and the American unions, who wouldn't let him operate his own camera. 'Ridley brought out the best in people, but he was difficult,' production designer Lawrence Paull said. The production company decided that the film was too confusing, and insisted on a voiceover and a tacked-on happy ending that Scott hated. But the film's vision of a broken-down future filled with linguistic chaos (plus smoke and neon) was enormously influential. It did badly at the box office, and critics, including the New Yorker's Pauline Kael, savaged it, but by the end of the Eighties academics were treating it as the decade's most important film, a benchmark of postmodernism. It also ran and ran in late-night showings. </p> <p>In 1992, something approaching Scott's original edit was released as the 'Director's Cut'. Scott, naturally, still wasn't satisfied. By the time that opinions were revised on Blade Runner, Scott was being overshadowed by his brother, who had enormous box-office success with Top Gun and Beverly Hills Cop II. Meanwhile, Ridley had made the fantasy flop Legend (1985) - with a young Tom Cruise - an excellent romantic thriller, Someone To Watch Over Me (1987), and Black Rain (1989) with Michael Douglas, which seemed largely designed to prove that Japanese cities looked just like the LA of Blade Runner. </p> <p>Scott's next film came as a surprise. The fact that most of the action takes place in the daytime was enough to set Thelma and Louise apart from previous films, before you even got into the sexual politics of the piece. It is also warmer, funnier and more focused on character than any of his films, bar Someone To Watch Over Me. Scott even cast Harvey Keitel against type as a nice cop. It seemed to promise Scott a way out of his own straitjacket, but of the films that followed - 1492: Conquest Of Paradise (1992), White Squall (1996) and GI Jane (1997), in which Demi Moore screams 'Suck my dick!' - the less said the better. </p> <p>All the while, Scott has continued to make ads - including a 1984-inspired promotion for Macintosh which was only shown once (to create the sense of an event) and is a legend in the advertising world, and the first of the BT 'It's good to talk' commercials with Bob Hoskins. </p> <p>This was one of the things perceived as setting the Scott brothers apart from the British film establishment. Their lack of a theatrical background might have been the secret of their success as film-makers, but - Soho wisdom had it - it made them different. They were too Hollywood, even if Scott lives much of the time in Hampstead when not on location. But as Alan Parker now is the British film establishment, the Scotts can hardly be considered outsiders. In any event, there was a great fanfare when the Scott brothers bought Shepperton Studios in 1995. At times, Scott has seemed as interested in business as films. 'I think he likes business,' David Puttnam says. 'But I don't think his best friends would call him a particularly good businessman. I always thought that if Ridley had concentrated solely on making movies he would have a clutch of Oscars under his belt, because he certainly has the talent. He has just allowed himself, all too often, to get distracted. I just wish he devoted more time to his film-making because along the way there have been films that didn't do his talent justice.' Ridley Scott is currently working on Hannibal, the sequel to Silence Of The Lambs. Both Jodie Foster and Jonathan Demme passed on it, Demme because he found the book too lurid. But Thomas Harris's books have been excellent movie material - Michael Mann's Manhunter is probably better than Silence Of The Lambs - which gives Scott a chance to enter the most consistent period of his career. </p> <p>And finally, in his sixties, fulfil his potential. David Puttnam argues: 'In his oeuvre, there are half a dozen really great movies. All I'm saying is, that there should have been a dozen, because he had it in him.' </p> <p><strong> Ridley Scott</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Born: </strong> South Shields, 30 November 1937 </p> <p><strong> Studied: </strong> West Hartlepool College of Art, Royal College of Art </p> <p><strong> Job: </strong> Film director, ad maker </p> <p><strong> Previous jobs: </strong> Television designer and director ( Z Cars, The Informer, Adam Adamant Lives ) </p> <p><strong> First film:</strong> Boy on a Bicycle (starring his brother, Tony, and his father) </p> <p><strong> Notable films:</strong> The Duellists, Alien, Blade Runner, Black Rain, Thelma and Louise </p> <p><strong> Latest film: </strong> Gladiator (shot in Malta) </p> <p><strong> Next film: </strong> Hannibal </p> <p><strong> Notable ads:</strong> Hovis, BT's It's Good to Talk</p>",

It is also warmer, funnier and more focused on character than any of his films, bar Someone To Watch Over Me. Scott even cast Harvey Keitel against type as a nice cop. It seemed to promise Scott a way out of his own straitjacket, but of the films that followed - 1492: Conquest Of Paradise (1992), White Squall (1996) and GI Jane (1997), in which Demi Moore screams 'Suck my dick!' - the less said the better. All the while, Scott has continued to make ads - including a 1984-inspired promotion for Macintosh which was only shown once (to create the sense of an event) and is a legend in the advertising world, and the first of the BT 'It's good to talk' commercials with Bob Hoskins. This was one of the things perceived as setting the Scott brothers apart from the British film establishment. Their lack of a theatrical background might have been the secret of their success as film-makers, but - Soho wisdom had it - it made them different. They were too Hollywood, even if Scott lives much of the time in Hampstead when not on location. But as Alan Parker now is the British film establishment, the Scotts can hardly be considered outsiders. In any event, there was a great fanfare when the Scott brothers bought Shepperton Studios in 1995. At times, Scott has seemed as interested in business as films. 'I think he likes business,' David Puttnam says. 'But I don't think his best friends would call him a particularly good businessman. I always thought that if Ridley had concentrated solely on making movies he would have a clutch of Oscars under his belt, because he certainly has the talent. He has just allowed himself, all too often, to get distracted. I just wish he devoted more time to his film-making because along the way there have been films that didn't do his talent justice.' Ridley Scott is currently working on Hannibal, the sequel to Silence Of The Lambs. Both Jodie Foster and Jonathan Demme passed on it, Demme because he found the book too lurid. But Thomas Harris's books have been excellent movie material - Michael Mann's Manhunter is probably better than Silence Of The Lambs - which gives Scott a chance to enter the most consistent period of his career. And finally, in his sixties, fulfil his potential. David Puttnam argues: 'In his oeuvre, there are half a dozen really great movies. All I'm saying is, that there should have been a dozen, because he had it in him.' Ridley Scott Born: South Shields, 30 November 1937 Studied: West Hartlepool College of Art, Royal College of Art Job: Film director, ad maker Previous jobs: Television designer and director ( Z Cars, The Informer, Adam Adamant Lives ) First film: Boy on a Bicycle (starring his brother, Tony, and his father) Notable films: The Duellists, Alien, Blade Runner, Black Rain, Thelma and Louise Latest film: Gladiator (shot in Malta) Next film: Hannibal Notable ads: Hovis, BT's It's Good to Talk",

      "body": "<p>For anyone who likes to see the chinks in the Hollywood publicity machine, the last two weeks have been bliss. There have been stories of fighting on the set of Charlie's Angels, feuding between Samuel L. Jackson and the director and crew of Shaft, plus the news that shooting has finally finished on the crisis-plagued Town And Country and that Mission: Impossible 2 (pictured) needs to be completely re-edited. </p> <p>As gossip, these stories are great. As a chance to indulge in a little Schadenfreude at the expense of the rich and beautiful, they are priceless. But for publications covering these stories, there is a justification that puts printing this stuff slightly above mere scandal-mongering. Call it the Heaven's Gate defence, or the Waterworld exemption. Tales of the raging egos of Jackson or Town And Country star Warren Beatty are fair game because chaos in production often equals critical and commercial disaster later on. </p> <p>This is sober business news. That theory might actually work with Town And Country. A comedy about two husbands leaving their wives, the budget has swollen to $82 million, making it hard to see how the film will ever turn a profit. And the fingers pointed to Beatty, who finds it almost impossible to just star in film - he has to make decisions. But Michael De Luca from New Line pictures has accepted the blame. </p> <p>The problem began when De Luca decided to push shooting ahead to fit the schedules of his chosen cast - Beatty, Diane Keaton and Garry Shandling. The hitch? The script wasn't ready. The film went ahead anyway, with an ending nobody liked. The film wrapped in April 1999, but preview audiences hated it so much that the cast - who had finished their next films - were called back a year later to reshoot the ending and various other scenes. All this - including emergency rewrites by Buck Henry and Pleasantville director Gary Ross - has doubled the budget. </p> <p>The Charlie's Angels stories are juicier. Ally McBeal star Lucy Liu and Bill Murray (who plays Bosley) shut down production for a day with an argument which according to some (denied) reports ended with Liu hitting Murray. Liu had a problem with the script, although which one might be a fair question since they have reached the 30th draft. Murray tried to defend the writers and Liu turned on him. There have also been suggestions that she was annoyed by the difference between her wage and those of her more famous fellow Angels, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz. All of which was tough on Barrymore, who has been understandably tearful since her boyfriend, MTV comedian Tom Green, discovered he had testicular cancer. </p> <p>It came as almost incidental news that the three original Angels had turned down $100,000 apiece to do the customary cameo in the film. Jaclyn Smith just said no, Kate Jackson wanted to play a villain, and Farah Fawcett reportedly wanted to do a love scene with the never-seen Charlie. The producers turned down both ideas. But at least Smith, Jackson and Fawcett got offers, which is more than can be said for replacement Angels Cheryl Ladd and Tanya Roberts. </p> <p>Over on the reactivated set of Shaft, they have been shooting a sex scene with out the presence of the star, Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson has a good excuse: he's busy with his next film, and it is not his fault that test audiences felt that the film had forgotten the part about Shaft being 'a sex machine with all the chicks'. </p> <p>But the rumours have it that the crew were glad it was a body double and not Jackson doing the new title sequence of two shadowy figures in bed. The New York Post has an unidentified source saying: 'Nobody could stand the idea of having to work with him again. So they found a way to do it without having him back. Him, his entourage, and his private planes.' The story goes that Jackson kept slipping off to the golf course. </p> <p>Meanwhile, director John Singleton (Boyz N The Hood) was nipping into his trailer with a variety of extras. And feuding with producer Scott Rudin about the lack of black faces in the crew. Jackson, in turn, has suggested that he will be back for the sequel but Singleton won't. </p> <p>And then there is Mission: Impossible 2, scheduled for release at Christmas last year, but delayed because Tom Cruise was trapped on Eyes Wide Shut. Now editor/director Stuart Baird has been hired, at an estimated cost of $750,000, for three weeks' work, to cut the $180m film into shape. All this hasty last-minute fixing suggests that M:I-2, like Charlie's Angels, has the doomed aura of the next Waterworld to it, right? </p> <p>Not necessarily. In spring and summer 1997, there was a film that seemed certain to follow in the footsteps of Kevin Costner's folly. Like Waterworld, it was set at sea, which always causes production nightmare. The stars - especially the leading actress - were publicly feuding with the director. One night, the whole crew fell ill after eating lobster chowder that had been spiked, possibly with PCP (angel dust). There were rumours of near-drownings. The Screen Actors Guild sent a team to the set to investigate what was being done to its members. The sprawling running time was hopelessly uncommercial, which was troubling because the budget had spiralled into record territory: just to break even, it would have be one of the most successful films ever. To spread the pain, Fox had sold the US rights to Paramount for $65m. The press gleefully reported each new crisis. The massive waste of money was the angle until a couple of weeks before Titanic was released, at which point the whole story changed swiftly. </p> <p>There's nothing unique about the Titanic saga. In any business textbook, Gone With The Wind would be a great example of how not to make a film. It started shooting without a finished script or a female lead. George Cukor, the first director, was fired - reputedly on the orders of Clark Gable, uncomfortable with Cukor's homosexuality. His replacement, Victor Fleming, had a breakdown and Sam Wood finished the film. Ben Hecht was able to pick up $10,000 for a single week's work on the script. It was, inevitably, the most expensive film that had ever been made. </p> <p>And if Town And Country has had problems with its ending, that might be the only thing it has in common with Casablanca, which was driven ahead even though no one knew how the story would finish. Ingrid Bergman was driven to distraction, not knowing who her character was going to end up with. The team scriptwriters somehow stumbled towards the right answer. With Titanic or Gone With The Wind, success had the effect of gently relegating the struggle of making the film to a footnote. </p> <p>With Apocalypse Now, the legend of the making of the film and the film itself are complementary. Coppola had already survived The Godfather, which he himself was convinced was a disaster until it was released. There is squabbling to this day over who was responsible for the final edit. But that turned out to be a mere taster for the horrors of Apocalypse Now. It started with the sacking of Harvey Keitel and continued with Martin Sheen's heart attack, the massive drug abuse, the storm-smashed sets, the arguments with the Philippines air force over the use of helicopters that were fighting a real war, the three years it took to make the film, Brando, the budget that tripled and, yes, the fumbling towards an ending when most of the film had been shot. </p> <p>At the time, Coppola looked to have been outmanoeuvred by Michael Cimino, whose The Deer Hunter was as ambitious but much cheaper, released much sooner and got better reviews. But as time goes on, the myth of Apocalypse Now has given it the edge: because Coppola really had hauled his cast, crew and family up river, into the heart of darkness. </p> <p>And famous flops have emerged without long foreshadowings of what was to happen. It's hard to cut through the bland interview ritual where stars insist that working on a film has been fun, but here's Ewan McGregor promoting the Danny Boyle miscue A Life Less Ordinary: 'It's a fucking cracking movie. Let's talk about it, as long as we can stress how fucking great Cameron Diaz is. She the best!' For a few months, McGregor and Diaz were a ubiquitous pair, to emphasise the incredible screen chemistry they had. However much fun they were having, it didn't show in the film. </p> <p>Or how about Airplane director claiming South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were 'as good as the Jim Carreys and Eddie Murphys' when they starred in his comedy BASEketball. The film was grounded in the mutual admiration between director and stars, but despite being released at the height of South Park mania it was a box-office disaster and went straight-to-video here. </p> <p> And while everyone decided that Waterworld was going to be one of the biggest flops in movie history while it was being made, no one talked much about The Postman until the trailers appeared and provoked audience hysterics. Not made at sea, it didn't have the production traumas of its predecessor. It was, however, an even worse film. While Waterworld probably broke even in the end, The Postman never will. It certainly seems like the film that didn't cause fights on set, because no one was allowed to challenge director and star Costner's vision. Punch-ups, rows, reshoots: all these things at least suggest that someone is trying to save a film. With The Postman, no one realised until it was too late that the film was in trouble. Get all the voyeuristic kicks you can from stories of on-set nightmares, but politely ignore anyone who tells you they are portents of doom for a film.</p>",

Kaufman invented an alter ego, or rather an alter id, called Tony Clifton, a slobbish, racist, third-rate Las Vegas club performer, usually played by himself but occasionally by his partner and fellow provocateur, Bob Zmuda, and they even managed to get Clifton ejected from the Paramount lot. </p> <p>Kaufman deliberately got up the nostrils of women and Southerners by staging bouts of all-in wrestling between himself and female challengers in Memphis. He emptied an auditorium of student fans in Arizona by refusing to reprise Latka Gravas for them and instead reading the whole of The Great Gatsby in a fruity English accent. He booked Carnegie Hall for a concert, but confronted those who came to be outraged with a kitschy version of a Radio City Music Hall Christmas show complete with Rockettes and Santa Claus. Eventually, he achieved his ambition of estranging most of his followers and failing to be believed when he said he had cancer. </p> <p>Kaufman was a role player in the tradition of that archetypal American figure, the chameleon confidence trickster and, in Jim Carrey's bravura performance, Kaufman is always performing. The movie is a single, extended turn that incorporates smaller ones on and off stage. </p> <p>Forman uses his formidable skills as a documentarian and a director of actors to recreate TV appearances, club acts and stage shows. They're indistinguishable from the real thing and, in fact, the scenes involving Taxi are performed by Carrey with Christopher Lloyd, Marilu Henner, Judd Hirsch, Carol Kane and other members of the original cast. Of course, Danny De Vito can't play himself in Taxi as he's been cast as George Shapiro, Kaufman's devoted but constantly exasperated agent. </p> <p>Shapiro, De Vito and Bob Zmuda have co-produced the film, with Kaufman's live-in girlfriend, Lynne Margulies (played on screen by Courtney Love), as 'creative consultant'.

Irish scholars and relatives of Joyce, who died in 1941, have accepted the high sexual content as defensible. Many also praised actress Susan Lynch, who plays Nora. </p> <p>'Theirs was certainly a very sexual relationship,' said Monaghan. 'It had to be because there was not much else they had in common. I think Susan Lynch is exactly what Nora should be. I never met her because she left Dublin for the last time before I was born, but obviously I heard a lot about her. She thought my mother, May, James's sister, disapproved of her for being lower class.' </p> <p>Maddox herself recognises that the film is distinct from her book and told The Observer she was broadly pleased with it. The film's main detractor is Stephen James Joyce, Joyce's grandson and the sole executor of the literary estate. He has always been opposed to Maddox's book and is renowned for his sensitivity towards biographical interest in his family. He has accused film-maker Pat Murphy of permanently damaging the reputation of his grandparents. </p> <p>Two years ago he took unsuccessful legal action against Picador which brought out a populist Reader's edition of Ulysses. It attempted to regularise the erratic spelling and punctuation in the epic which annoyed the author's nephew along with Joyce academics. McGregor knew that he would be putting his neck on the block by playing the part. </p> <p>'Everyone will have a different idea of who he was, but what really impressed me was Nora was not a script about Joyce the writer. It was a love story. I liked that because you don't get vast waves of his writing pushed down your throat.' </p> <p>Murphy, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Gerry Stembridge, said, 'I wanted it to touch on all the darker parts of their relationship but also to have moments that reflect Nora's sense of humour.' </p>",

The film's main detractor is Stephen James Joyce, Joyce's grandson and the sole executor of the literary estate. He has always been opposed to Maddox's book and is renowned for his sensitivity towards biographical interest in his family. He has accused film-maker Pat Murphy of permanently damaging the reputation of his grandparents. Two years ago he took unsuccessful legal action against Picador which brought out a populist Reader's edition of Ulysses. It attempted to regularise the erratic spelling and punctuation in the epic which annoyed the author's nephew along with Joyce academics. McGregor knew that he would be putting his neck on the block by playing the part. 'Everyone will have a different idea of who he was, but what really impressed me was Nora was not a script about Joyce the writer. It was a love story. I liked that because you don't get vast waves of his writing pushed down your throat.' Murphy, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Gerry Stembridge, said, 'I wanted it to touch on all the darker parts of their relationship but also to have moments that reflect Nora's sense of humour.'",

      "body": "<p>There is one throw-it-together midweek supper I make year in year out. It consists of nothing more than a few handfuls of pasta tossed with olive oil, parsley and Parmesan. It is instantly satisfying and ready before I have taken off my coat or even poured myself a drink. The meal generates only a pan, a colander, a bowl and a fork in terms of washing up (unless you are the sort of person who washes their cheese grater rather than tapping it on the kitchen counter as I do), and is as cheap as chips. True, it relies on a bottle of decent olive oil, a bunch of vivid green and perky parsley and a generous hand with the Parmesan, but it is hardly much of a shopping list. Yet it is the meal I make most often, though in truth I usually throw a bit of salad in a bowl to eat afterwards. </p> <p>This is not a meal that knocks your socks off with its originality. Neither is it a recipe for impressing your neighbours. It is just a nice, straightforward and somewhat understated supper. I suppose I should point out that it works best if you have stopped at Oddbins on the way home for a bottle of glorious Icardi. Yet its simplicity can be its downfall. This is one of those recipes that stands or falls entirely by the quality of its (very few) ingredients. Few recipes so perfectly illustrate what I have been banging on about for years - that the integrity of the ingredients is more crucial than the ability of the cook. In other words, shopping is more important than cooking. </p> <p>All the parts of a recipe such as this are as important as one another. The pasta needs to be a decent Italian brand, the olive oil should be your favourite (it does not matter whether it is a creamy, peppery, fruity or rasping oil, so long as it is one you truly like) and it goes without saying that the parsley needs to be bright and fresh. But none of this will make one jot of difference if the cheese comes ready-grated in a little cardboard drum. The Parmesan you grate for yourself from a great craggy lump is altogether different from one bought ready-ground. The way I look at it is this: if we were really meant to buy the stuff that comes in a little cardboard drum, then how come it smells like vomit? </p> <p>A whole wheel of Parmesan is a wonderful sight - as big as a coffee table and three times as heavy, it takes more than one to lift it and an experienced hand to cut it into manageable lumps. When I say manageable, I am talking about price as much as size. Good Parmesan does not come cheap. In Italy, I have seen it labelled Grana, which is in fact a general name for all of their very hard, grainy cheeses used for grating, but the sort that is particularly worth seeking out is one with a hard shell that is covered with little dots bearing the words Parmigiano Reggiano. </p> <p>I found out the other day that the Parmesan I have been buying recently is about two years old, which is not especially ancient for this particular cheese. The older it gets, the harder and more tangy it becomes. (I don't really like the word 'tangy', but it does seem perfect to describe the after-notes of an old Reggiano.) The younger cheeses you come across in the supermarket are not to be despised, though. Their damp softness makes them easy to slice with a vegetable peeler to scatter over a salad of, say, cos lettuce and walnuts. But they lack the finesse and the deep, long-lasting savour of an older cheese. For grating, you will need more than you would from a bolder, older one. </p> <p>Whenever I am asked one of those 'what ingredients do you always have in your kitchen' questions, then a lump of Parmigiano is never far behind the Illy espresso, tiny Ligurian olives and Evian. (We don't have to go much further down the list before we bump into Smarties.) Try adding a handful of Parmesan to your next green salad. With a copious and mustardy dressing, the cheese will make a flimsy salad substantial enough to call itself a light lunch. </p> <p>Broken off in lumps, it is a surprisingly good cheese to eat with fruit - especially luscious pears (the cold juice of the fruit and the salty, sharp tang of the cheese is indescribably good), and then there is the strange-sounding pairing of peas and cheese. Yes, I know, odd and unimaginable - but it works. Boil and strain the peas, then toss them with a thin coating of melting butter and a sizeable shake of Parmesan. </p> <p>How I grate my Grana depends very much on the maturity of the cheese. I have a natty little grater I bought in Milan (you can get them in any kitchen shop - I am just showing off) which has sharp, square teeth. It seems to produce just the right size gratings for melting. Any larger, and the cheese seems to stay in shape, like cheese-flavoured gravel. I use this small hand-grater for soft, young Parmesan. For older, more interestingly flavoured cheeses, I tend to get out the food processor, first grating the cheese on a coarse setting, then swapping it for the large blade to get it really fine. Disliking drawers full of bits and bobs, I have not yet fallen for one of those old-fashioned barrel graters where you hold the cheese down against a revolving drum. I have met those who swear by them. </p> <p>I should mention that this cheese is no different to any other when it meets the heat, and you should avoid at all costs overcooking it. Grated Reggiano should turn a sumptuous pale gold; any darker and it may turn bitter. Which means you have to keep an eye on it under the grill. It will burn faster than you can say hard cheese. </p> <p> <strong> Parmesan biscuits</strong> </p> <p> Tiny, crumbly biscuits to eat with drinks. They take barely 10 minutes to make and not much more than that to bake. Makes about 20. </p> <p>125g plain flour <br>100g cold butter <br>80g finely grated Parmesan <br>1 egg yolk <br>a little ground chilli powder </p> <p>Put the flour into a mixing bowl and add the butter cut into small chunks.

      "bodyText": "There is one throw-it-together midweek supper I make year in year out. It consists of nothing more than a few handfuls of pasta tossed with olive oil, parsley and Parmesan. It is instantly satisfying and ready before I have taken off my coat or even poured myself a drink. The meal generates only a pan, a colander, a bowl and a fork in terms of washing up (unless you are the sort of person who washes their cheese grater rather than tapping it on the kitchen counter as I do), and is as cheap as chips. True, it relies on a bottle of decent olive oil, a bunch of vivid green and perky parsley and a generous hand with the Parmesan, but it is hardly much of a shopping list. Yet it is the meal I make most often, though in truth I usually throw a bit of salad in a bowl to eat afterwards. This is not a meal that knocks your socks off with its originality. Neither is it a recipe for impressing your neighbours. It is just a nice, straightforward and somewhat understated supper. I suppose I should point out that it works best if you have stopped at Oddbins on the way home for a bottle of glorious Icardi. Yet its simplicity can be its downfall. This is one of those recipes that stands or falls entirely by the quality of its (very few) ingredients. Few recipes so perfectly illustrate what I have been banging on about for years - that the integrity of the ingredients is more crucial than the ability of the cook. In other words, shopping is more important than cooking. All the parts of a recipe such as this are as important as one another. The pasta needs to be a decent Italian brand, the olive oil should be your favourite (it does not matter whether it is a creamy, peppery, fruity or rasping oil, so long as it is one you truly like) and it goes without saying that the parsley needs to be bright and fresh. But none of this will make one jot of difference if the cheese comes ready-grated in a little cardboard drum. The Parmesan you grate for yourself from a great craggy lump is altogether different from one bought ready-ground. The way I look at it is this: if we were really meant to buy the stuff that comes in a little cardboard drum, then how come it smells like vomit? A whole wheel of Parmesan is a wonderful sight - as big as a coffee table and three times as heavy, it takes more than one to lift it and an experienced hand to cut it into manageable lumps. When I say manageable, I am talking about price as much as size. Good Parmesan does not come cheap. In Italy, I have seen it labelled Grana, which is in fact a general name for all of their very hard, grainy cheeses used for grating, but the sort that is particularly worth seeking out is one with a hard shell that is covered with little dots bearing the words Parmigiano Reggiano. I found out the other day that the Parmesan I have been buying recently is about two years old, which is not especially ancient for this particular cheese. The older it gets, the harder and more tangy it becomes. (I don't really like the word 'tangy', but it does seem perfect to describe the after-notes of an old Reggiano.) The younger cheeses you come across in the supermarket are not to be despised, though. Their damp softness makes them easy to slice with a vegetable peeler to scatter over a salad of, say, cos lettuce and walnuts. But they lack the finesse and the deep, long-lasting savour of an older cheese. For grating, you will need more than you would from a bolder, older one. Whenever I am asked one of those 'what ingredients do you always have in your kitchen' questions, then a lump of Parmigiano is never far behind the Illy espresso, tiny Ligurian olives and Evian. (We don't have to go much further down the list before we bump into Smarties.) Try adding a handful of Parmesan to your next green salad. With a copious and mustardy dressing, the cheese will make a flimsy salad substantial enough to call itself a light lunch. Broken off in lumps, it is a surprisingly good cheese to eat with fruit - especially luscious pears (the cold juice of the fruit and the salty, sharp tang of the cheese is indescribably good), and then there is the strange-sounding pairing of peas and cheese. Yes, I know, odd and unimaginable - but it works. Boil and strain the peas, then toss them with a thin coating of melting butter and a sizeable shake of Parmesan. How I grate my Grana depends very much on the maturity of the cheese. I have a natty little grater I bought in Milan (you can get them in any kitchen shop - I am just showing off) which has sharp, square teeth. It seems to produce just the right size gratings for melting. Any larger, and the cheese seems to stay in shape, like cheese-flavoured gravel. I use this small hand-grater for soft, young Parmesan. For older, more interestingly flavoured cheeses, I tend to get out the food processor, first grating the cheese on a coarse setting, then swapping it for the large blade to get it really fine. Disliking drawers full of bits and bobs, I have not yet fallen for one of those old-fashioned barrel graters where you hold the cheese down against a revolving drum. I have met those who swear by them. I should mention that this cheese is no different to any other when it meets the heat, and you should avoid at all costs overcooking it. Grated Reggiano should turn a sumptuous pale gold; any darker and it may turn bitter. Which means you have to keep an eye on it under the grill. It will burn faster than you can say hard cheese. Parmesan biscuits Tiny, crumbly biscuits to eat with drinks. They take barely 10 minutes to make and not much more than that to bake. Makes about 20. 125g plain flour 100g cold butter 80g finely grated Parmesan 1 egg yolk a little ground chilli powder Put the flour into a mixing bowl and add the butter cut into small chunks. Rub the butter into the flour with your fingertips until it looks like fine, fresh breadcrumbs. It is essential that you don't go too far with this, and that you stop rubbing in as soon as the flour and butter look crumb-like. Add the grated Parmesan, the egg yolk, a pinch of chilli powder and very little salt. Now gently bring the dough together with your hands, squeezing and softly kneading it till it looks like coarse pastry. Twist the dough in two and roll each into a fat cylinder about the diameter of a \u00a32 coin. Slice each roll into thick discs, about 0.5cm thick - less than the thickness of your little finger. Place each slice on a baking sheet and bake at 170\u00b0C/gas mark 3 for 18-20 minutes. They are ready when pale gold and crumbly. Lift them carefully from the baking sheet - they will be very tender - and allow them to cool on a rack. The biscuits are best eaten an hour or less after baking, though you can keep them for a day or two in an airtight container. Penne with Parmesan and parsley Those who find this treatment for pasta a little abstemious may like to sneak in some melted butter - about 50g, a good thick slice. Serves 2. 300g penne rigate or other short, tubular pasta a generous handful of chopped parsley extra-virgin olive oil 80g finely grated Parmesan Bring a large, deep pan of water to the boil. Add a generous amount of salt and then the pasta. Cook until it is tender but still has a bit of bite. Most dried pasta takes about nine minutes to reach this toothsome yet tender stage. Drain the pasta quickly but not especially thoroughly. A little excess moisture is a good thing here. Return the pasta to the pan, throw in the chopped parsley, a generous drizzle of your favourite extra-virgin oil and then the Parmesan. Put a lid on the pan for a minute, then remove and toss the hot pasta with the softening cheese. Baked plaice with Parmesan crumbs I have never really gone along with the pairing of cheese and fish, yet it works here. This recipe, incidentally, is something I first made a couple of years ago and comes from Real Food. Serves 2. 2 large plaice fillets, skin on 4 gently heaping tbsps fine white breadcrumbs 6 level tbsps finely grated Parmesan 4 tbsps melted butter 2 tbsps olive oil Lay the fish skin-side down in a buttered ovenproof dish. Mix the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, melted butter and oil and grind over a little salt and black pepper. Spread the seasoned crumbs loosely over the fish, then bake for 20 minutes in an oven preheated to 220\u00b0C/gas mark 7. \u0095 Real Food is just out in paperback (Fourth Estate, \u00a312.99)",

      "body": "<p>Lingerie is a fancy French name for underwear. Underwear is any garment that is not meant to be seen in public; the category includes, from the skin out, pants, singlets, brassieres, corsets, girdles, suspender-belts, vests, slips and petticoats. Under each of these headings could be marshalled dozens of variations; pants, for example, include briefs, Y-fronts, jockey shorts, boxer shorts, knickers, cami-knickers, drawers, bloomers, panties, pantettes, panty-girdles, panty-shorts, pant-slips, scanties, bikini briefs and thongs.</p> <p>Who wears all this stuff? And why is our culture increasingly obsessed by it? British people spent \u00a31.6 billion on lingerie last year, 25 per cent more than in 1991, influenced no doubt by the images that proliferate everywhere. Underwear is used to sell anything from Citro\u00ebn cars to the Vogue website. There is even an exhibition of underwear, Inside Out, organised by the British Council, opening in London next month. </p> <p>When I was growing up, certain kinds of women's underwear were called 'foundation garments'. If your clothes were to look good you had to underprop them with foundation garments, so at 14 or so you were packed off to be 'fitted' with your first bra and girdle. The bra fitter was usually a deep-voiced, whiskery female of what seemed horrifyingly advanced years and she measured your budding breast by (horribly) spreading her hand over it.</p> <p>The girdle was (and still is) a garment so repellent that you had to dash to take it off in the toilet and stuff it down behind the cistern before foreplay reached the revelation point. Nowadays, firmness of the rear end is supposed to be achieved by working out, and no more covering needed than a thong. But thongs can be repellent on certain bodies. My hairdresser confided to me the other day that, though his wife is a beautiful woman he finds the sight of her buttocks surrounding a thong deeply off-putting. The very thought of Cherie Blair's mythical thong is mind-boggling. </p> <p>One function of underwear is to provide an extra layer of insulation from the cold. Princess Diana thrilled her adoring public when she admitted that she wore Thermolactyl smalls under her evening gowns so that she could stand still for hours in draughty halls without succumbing to hypothermia. However, the undergarment as defence against the cold is becoming unnecessary as indoor temperatures rise; though, outside, people might need sheepskins in winter, indoors it is usually so hot they have to remove all insulation and work in shirt-sleeves. Skiers and mountaineers might wear spencers and longjohns; the rest of us do not.</p> <p>Most Englishmen do not wear vests under their shirts any more; many Englishmen who do wear vests wear nothing over them. Sensible underwear, it seems, is either being worn as outerwear or being phased out. In fact underwear has always shown a tendency to transmigrate and appear as outerwear. Corsets have as often been worn outside dresses as inside them. However, neither Superman nor John Major succeeded in popularising the wearing of Y-fronts over instead of under trousers. In the days when she was still ambulatory my mother used to thrill beholders by flaunting herself in ancient, threadbare and virtually transparent men's longjohns. </p> <p>If underwear was meant to keep you warm you would expect that in hot countries people wear less of it - and by and large that is true. People who pass their lives naked except for a few strings of beads and a penis sheath are unlikely to go a bundle on underwear, but as soon as the missionaries get to work on them they adopt not only European styles of outer dress but also underwear.</p> <p>Aborigine women living in the broiling heat of Australia wear gathered skirts with slips under them made of hot, clingy synthetic material trimmed with cheap lace, which rapidly becomes tattered. When both skirt and slip become unbearably dirty and brittle they are thrown away, thus becoming genuinely disposable unlike the mad paper pants we used to wear that fell to pieces while you were still in them. Throughout outback Australia the traveller will encounter long lines of discarded clothing, and sometimes hillocks of it. </p> <p>The wearing of slips in aboriginal culture implies decency; it is a response to the long history of abuse of aboriginal women by white men and then by demoralised black men. A largely futile assertion of propriety is now part and parcel of the rationale of clothing where, for 400,000 years, there was no clothing together with a fierce sense of bodily propriety. </p> <p>Naked peoples associate modesty not with covering but with demeanour; only after they have been made aware of their bodies as object of prurient interest on the part of intrusive strangers do they feel a pressing need to hide parts of them. Missionaries, only too aware of their own lechery, used to insist on the wearing of clothes and underclothes. A mission-educated native who cast aside his clothing was considered to have reverted to savagery. </p> <p>The association of underwear with decency runs deep. All the year round except for high summer my Tuscan housekeeper wore an astonishing array of underwear - knickers, a brassiere, a woollen vest, a girdle, a petticoat and stockings knotted above her knees. Whenever she bent over to cull a mushroom or gather wild salad, an extraordinary panorama of elastic and cheap lace was revealed.</p> <p>Even in the hottest weather Lisa retained under her print dress and overall an essential minimum of underwear: bra, petticoat and knickers. As I had no secrets from her she knew that I did not so much as possess these articles; she also knew that I slept naked, but I never knew what she thought of this loucheness on my part. My Italian lover made his feelings plain; he would pull at the top of my dress, peer down it, and curse a blue streak when he saw me standing naked inside it. </p> <p>My housekeeper's body was a white tender kernel protected from the cruel sun and the glacial mountain breezes alike by multiple wrappings like the skins of an onion. She firmly believed that if she worked up a sweat she must absolutely not remove any of her layers, for if the sweat cooled on her body she would fall ill. In her case, too, it seemed to me that her layers of underwear conferred decency. She had lived close to destitution all her life; when she married her husband, who was a carbonaro, poorest of the peasant poor, she had not even a coverlet to her bed. Her edifice of unnecessary raiment was the testimony that, though she was still illiterate, she had become a person of substance, una persona seria. </p> <p>Lisa told me how it was in the old days, before the girls wore pants or shoes, when they wore just shifts, petticoats, full skirts and bodices. The discharge of menstruation was soaked up by the petticoats which the women wiped between their legs whenever necessary. For Lisa, acquiring pants and bras was part of modernisation, along with sanitary napkins and her husband's motorcycle truck. </p> <p>When Lisa was a girl, everyone in our part of the Tuscan hills urinated and defecated out of doors. To the end of her life Lisa had misgivings about doing one's bisogni in the house, a practice which seemed to her unhygienic. Because a husband did not accompany wife or daughter as she went out to empty bowels or bladder last thing at night, it was the best opportunity for a woman to meet her lover or encounter a sexual predator. (Judges then had as much difficulty distinguishing between the two as they do today.) The last thing she needed was knickers which, pulled down around her ankles, would be very likely to be soiled and certain to impede her flight if she should be disturbed. She did as all women used to do before the invention of drawers, bundled up her skirts or threw them over her head to keep them clean, and squatted with her legs sensibly apart. </p> <p>My mother used to say, as all Australian mothers proverbially said, that I must put on a clean pair of underpants every day in case I got knocked down by a car. For a while I collected briefs in fancy colours, mildly amused to think that under my regulation beatnik black glowed briefs of electric blue, fluorescent yellow or hot magenta. This phase came to an end when, after I gathered in my multi-coloured collection from the washing line in the sudden darkness of a Sydney summer night I discovered that someone had cut the crotch out of every pair. Thereafter I was more likely than not to leave my knickers off; as we left the house my man would run his thumb down my flank to see if he could feel a panty ridge; no ridge and I had to go back in and get some pants on. He was more concerned about my pants than I was, but why? </p> <p>Years later when I wrote about going without, I got hundreds of nagging letters. Knickers protected me from catching infections or infestations (eg crab lice) off train seats and the like, didn't I know? Conversely they would prevent the pollution of the environment by noxious liquids emanating from me. I thought then and I think now, better a bidet than a panty-liner. For 'heavier days' there were beautifully made Italian thongs lined with rubber latex. Otherwise, nothing. In those days I did not even wear panty-hose, but stockings that I knotted above the knee as Lisa had taught me (to avoid the obscenity of a suspender belt). And no bra, natch. Not very erotic, you will be thinking. Quite. </p> <p>It was a part of my feminist battle against pornography that I would not tackle up. A century ago randy little boys would pore over the corsetry advertisements in women's magazines and as the pornography industry has grown up it has elaborated this voyeuristic fixation. The passivity and vulnerability of the female subject of male erotic interest is accentuated by her being captured, as it were, as she undresses.</p> <p>The viewer of most commercial pornography is still hiding in a woman's wardrobe, peering through the keyhole as she pops her suspenders and pushes her stockings languorously down over her legs. Corsets are uncomfortable; lace is supremely uncomfortable; suspender belts are ridiculous; most brassieres fake rather than control the bosom. There are men who secretly yearn to wear all this kit. We may ask even of the men who do not, is it us they love or these fetishistic garments? </p> <p>The great undergarment success story of our time is the Wonderbra, which does not simply lift and separate, as did the brassieres of old, but literally tips the breasts into the face of the beholder, creating ebullient cleavage where otherwise there was none. The Wonderbra is clearly meant to allure but it is also bound to disappoint. Once a woman's Wonderbra has enticed a man into her arms she is faced with the dilemma of when to take it off. </p> <p>Every Wonderbra I have ever seen was padded; there is no half hemisphere corresponding to the half that is so impressively exposed. The Wonderbra removed, the bosom shrinks, the cleavage disappears as the released breasts obey the call of gravity and sag away from the sternum. </p> <p>The Wonderbra is one undergarment that must have been meant to stay on during sex, along with suspender-belts and black stockings and the rest of the tackle. Underwear is now sportswear. </p> <p>One of the mysteries of the twentieth century is how the brassiere conquered the world. You might think it was the great manufacturers who convinced women that they would not be real women until they tipped their breasts into a harness, but the dusty bras I've seen on display in the shopping lanes of ancient towns from China to Peru are locally made. The shape of the breasts might be international but the brand names are not.</p> <p>There is now no country in the world where women do not think it appropriate to strap their breasts into an immobile shape. The transformation of the useful breast into fetish object was accompanied by the marketing of synthetic babyfood, lipstick and high-heeled shoes, as the awesome imagery of the mother retreated in the face of the onward march of prostitution. </p> <p>\u0095 Inside Out is at the Design Museum, London SE1, from 1 June</p>",

(Judges then had as much difficulty distinguishing between the two as they do today.) The last thing she needed was knickers which, pulled down around her ankles, would be very likely to be soiled and certain to impede her flight if she should be disturbed. She did as all women used to do before the invention of drawers, bundled up her skirts or threw them over her head to keep them clean, and squatted with her legs sensibly apart. My mother used to say, as all Australian mothers proverbially said, that I must put on a clean pair of underpants every day in case I got knocked down by a car. For a while I collected briefs in fancy colours, mildly amused to think that under my regulation beatnik black glowed briefs of electric blue, fluorescent yellow or hot magenta. This phase came to an end when, after I gathered in my multi-coloured collection from the washing line in the sudden darkness of a Sydney summer night I discovered that someone had cut the crotch out of every pair. Thereafter I was more likely than not to leave my knickers off; as we left the house my man would run his thumb down my flank to see if he could feel a panty ridge; no ridge and I had to go back in and get some pants on. He was more concerned about my pants than I was, but why? Years later when I wrote about going without, I got hundreds of nagging letters. Knickers protected me from catching infections or infestations (eg crab lice) off train seats and the like, didn't I know? Conversely they would prevent the pollution of the environment by noxious liquids emanating from me. I thought then and I think now, better a bidet than a panty-liner. For 'heavier days' there were beautifully made Italian thongs lined with rubber latex. Otherwise, nothing. In those days I did not even wear panty-hose, but stockings that I knotted above the knee as Lisa had taught me (to avoid the obscenity of a suspender belt). And no bra, natch. Not very erotic, you will be thinking. Quite. It was a part of my feminist battle against pornography that I would not tackle up. A century ago randy little boys would pore over the corsetry advertisements in women's magazines and as the pornography industry has grown up it has elaborated this voyeuristic fixation. The passivity and vulnerability of the female subject of male erotic interest is accentuated by her being captured, as it were, as she undresses. The viewer of most commercial pornography is still hiding in a woman's wardrobe, peering through the keyhole as she pops her suspenders and pushes her stockings languorously down over her legs. Corsets are uncomfortable; lace is supremely uncomfortable; suspender belts are ridiculous; most brassieres fake rather than control the bosom. There are men who secretly yearn to wear all this kit. We may ask even of the men who do not, is it us they love or these fetishistic garments? The great undergarment success story of our time is the Wonderbra, which does not simply lift and separate, as did the brassieres of old, but literally tips the breasts into the face of the beholder, creating ebullient cleavage where otherwise there was none. The Wonderbra is clearly meant to allure but it is also bound to disappoint. Once a woman's Wonderbra has enticed a man into her arms she is faced with the dilemma of when to take it off. Every Wonderbra I have ever seen was padded; there is no half hemisphere corresponding to the half that is so impressively exposed. The Wonderbra removed, the bosom shrinks, the cleavage disappears as the released breasts obey the call of gravity and sag away from the sternum. The Wonderbra is one undergarment that must have been meant to stay on during sex, along with suspender-belts and black stockings and the rest of the tackle. Underwear is now sportswear. One of the mysteries of the twentieth century is how the brassiere conquered the world. You might think it was the great manufacturers who convinced women that they would not be real women until they tipped their breasts into a harness, but the dusty bras I've seen on display in the shopping lanes of ancient towns from China to Peru are locally made. The shape of the breasts might be international but the brand names are not. There is now no country in the world where women do not think it appropriate to strap their breasts into an immobile shape. The transformation of the useful breast into fetish object was accompanied by the marketing of synthetic babyfood, lipstick and high-heeled shoes, as the awesome imagery of the mother retreated in the face of the onward march of prostitution. \u0095 Inside Out is at the Design Museum, London SE1, from 1 June",

I've said it before, and I'll say it again, but I think there's nothing on earth more beautiful than the May blossom and cow parsley in full sail on a sunny May morning. What, you might well ask from your much-loved but small urban back garden, has that got to do with anything other than my own good fortune in being in the countryside? A lot. For a start, most of us try to capture an essence of the country within the confines of our gardens, be they never so urban and never so small. </p> <p>As a culture, we are receding from the countryside. More and more people see it as something to visit, like a theme park, rather than as a living, working environment. I suspect that most people are closer to their gardens than they are to any broader landscape around them. By observing what is happening at any season in the countryside, we can distil that and improve our gardens. That improvement will, of course, be subjective and largely emotional. I am all for this. Any intelligent harnessing of our feelings will improve the quality of both garden and gardening. A flowering, informal hedge immediately places the looseness and fecundity of open countryside within the strict limitations of our gardens. It implies a confidence and freedom of spirit and is, I think, profoundly liberating.</p> <p>Another point of looking at what is flowering around you is to do with timing. The television and journalism I am involved in tends to be driven by what the viewer/reader can do now, this weekend, and has to be topical and relevant. In this flurry of perfectly sensible relevance, it is easy to pass by one of the most important aspects of gardening, which is just looking. But it is not enough merely to see - you have to connect brain, eye and emotion. </p> <p>The images remain as part of an internal picture library that you can draw upon perhaps years later. This is why a lot of gardening is best done up to a year ahead.</p> <p>So, go and look for flowering hedges over the coming few months. Make notes, albeit mental ones, and plan for next year. What might you be looking for? Over the past few months, you might have seen a hedge of forsythia like a streak of mustard left on a plate, or ribes, which is an abuse on both eye and nose, or even - God forbid - both forsythia and ribes together, looking like one of those malevolent cakes lurking under a bell jar in a provincial tearoom. Flowering quince (Chaenomeles) is much better, as is the rampantly flamboyant kerria, or even horrid rhododendron, of which more anon. But do not think that a flowering hedge has no part in a formal garden. Think of lavender, rosemary, santolina or hyssop. All make good outline hedges, marking paths, geometric shapes and borders while also acting as a good foil for blowsy summer flowers, such as roses. </p> <p>As a rule, a flowering hedge is not a good idea for the back of a border. It would be too busy and distracting from the border itself. Anything other than a low hedge with flowers is best used as a boundary or to divide informal spaces such as the edge of an orchard.</p> <p>Roses, of course, make one of the best flowering hedges of all. You must use shrub roses and feed them well so they establish a good thick shape. Rosa rugosa is the one that is usually called in to perform this task, and does perform it superbly, being tough and fast growing. It is beautiful in flower and produces spectacular hips. </p> <p>Of the many rugosas, the pure-white 'Blanc Double de Coubert' is the most beautiful and best scented, with R rugosa var alba hard on its heels. R 'Roseraie de l'Hay' is the thickest and most floriferous, while the dark foliage and bright red flowers of 'Hunter' make for an almost holly-like contrast. 'Alba' roses are equally tough and also make good hedges, although they are not so free flowering, and Hybrid musks can be kept quite ordered. But centifolias, which include some of the loveliest flowers of all, will never be less than a bosomy, buxom hedge. Any rose hedge, however much you try and restrain it, always adds a softness to the garden, which is psychological as much as visual.</p> <p>Trim your hedge at the wrong time, though, and it will look neat but have no flowers. As a general rule, you are unlikely to go far wrong if you cut the hedge immediately after flowering, whenever that is. This does mean that by flowering time you will have a full year's growth, so a hawthorn or blackthorn hedge will be distinctly shaggy for half the year.</p> <p>As a non-floral diversion, you can make fabulous effects with form and space by growing yew or box hedges much wider than their mature height. There is a really good example of this outside the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam. Evergreen hedges are aesthetically more difficult, and I am not sure that I feel very keen on any of them. I think the wires get crossed. An evergreen hedge is a permanent barrier, whereas a flowering hedge is valued for the way it transforms itself and usurps the preconception of a hedge. If you want evergreen (and I do) why try to go beyond the best - namely yew, box or holly?</p> <p>Any late-flowering hedge has the advantage of remaining neatly trimmed throughout the winter. I agree that Osmanthus delavayi and O burkwoodii have wonderful fragrance and think they make good shrubs, but I cannot see why you would choose an osmanthus hedge over a holly one in the same situation, unless you were hooked on that particular scent. Choisya ternata can make a good hedge with delicious white flowers and is really tough. </p> <p>I would stick to the basic plant and avoid the yellow hybrid 'Sundance' on account of it being horrid en masse. If you have lots of space and your tastes incline that way, you can pick innumerable versions of rhododendron hedge, all smothered with flower. I am told that some people like this. If I go beyond my knee-jerk rejection of the whole ericaceous plant world, I think that what I miss in all flowering evergreens is that sense of uncontained wild exuberance that a flowering deciduous hedge somehow brings into the back garden. </p> <p>Perhaps you need to go to the foothills of the Himalayas and see the rhododendrons flowering there to appreciate their magic fully.

      "body": "<p>The foot soldier perched high above the audience at Verona's great Arena could take it no longer. Perhaps it was the heat, or the altitude, but for whatever reason, he crumpled silently to his knees, toppled gracefully to one side and, while his fellow infantrymen of the Egyptian army belted out a great chorus from Aida, was simply stretchered away, like any casualty of war. </p> <p>In the cheapest seats at Verona you may need binoculars, cushions and advanced powers of endurance, but you are rewarded with little vignettes such as the occasional collapsing swordbearer, or the snack salesman who slips in a quick rendition of Nessun Dorma between the acts. There is a pecking order at this great open air festival of opera: opera-goers on a tight budget in the towering gradinata tiers need to check in early to get the best, most central positions in their price bracket. Leave it until the last few minutes and you are nearer the celestial stars than the singing ones, and languishing around the edges. </p> <p>It is a different story in the top price poltrone (literally, 'armchairs') or poltronissime - 'very armchairs?' - at ground level. You get to make a grand entrance through a curtained archway, possibly in the wake of a diva on her night off, whose arrival will be greeted with a great cheer from the crowd already assembled. There is plush red seating, and in the event of rain, the chance of shelter. For it does rain in Verona, and mightily, as storms break operatically over the hills outside the city. One drop, and the orchestra packs up its instruments in mid-bar and makes for cover. </p> <p>Outside the Arena, the street sellers know a thing or two about meteorology. If they stop selling ices and start selling emergency rainwear half an hour before curtain up, you can be sure of rain. A performance may be interrupted a dozen times before it is abandoned - refunds from the box office need to be avoided. As the storm abates, ticketholders reveal their nationalities: the Italians chuck their plastic macs away, as litter; the British fold them up and take them home. </p> <p>Opera in the open air is in many ways a mad concept: even the astounding acoustics of Verona's Arena are at full stretch in a solo aria. But in their hearts, the audience have come for the massive choruses - Aida furnishes most, with Carmen a close second - and the theatrical permutations of people-moving. </p> <p>In smaller auditoria such as the one at Torre del Lago near Puccini's villa, the composer's music is more audible, wafting across the lake where he shot wildfowl con brio.

      "bodyText": "The foot soldier perched high above the audience at Verona's great Arena could take it no longer. Perhaps it was the heat, or the altitude, but for whatever reason, he crumpled silently to his knees, toppled gracefully to one side and, while his fellow infantrymen of the Egyptian army belted out a great chorus from Aida, was simply stretchered away, like any casualty of war. In the cheapest seats at Verona you may need binoculars, cushions and advanced powers of endurance, but you are rewarded with little vignettes such as the occasional collapsing swordbearer, or the snack salesman who slips in a quick rendition of Nessun Dorma between the acts. There is a pecking order at this great open air festival of opera: opera-goers on a tight budget in the towering gradinata tiers need to check in early to get the best, most central positions in their price bracket. Leave it until the last few minutes and you are nearer the celestial stars than the singing ones, and languishing around the edges. It is a different story in the top price poltrone (literally, 'armchairs') or poltronissime - 'very armchairs?' - at ground level. You get to make a grand entrance through a curtained archway, possibly in the wake of a diva on her night off, whose arrival will be greeted with a great cheer from the crowd already assembled. There is plush red seating, and in the event of rain, the chance of shelter. For it does rain in Verona, and mightily, as storms break operatically over the hills outside the city. One drop, and the orchestra packs up its instruments in mid-bar and makes for cover. Outside the Arena, the street sellers know a thing or two about meteorology. If they stop selling ices and start selling emergency rainwear half an hour before curtain up, you can be sure of rain. A performance may be interrupted a dozen times before it is abandoned - refunds from the box office need to be avoided. As the storm abates, ticketholders reveal their nationalities: the Italians chuck their plastic macs away, as litter; the British fold them up and take them home. Opera in the open air is in many ways a mad concept: even the astounding acoustics of Verona's Arena are at full stretch in a solo aria. But in their hearts, the audience have come for the massive choruses - Aida furnishes most, with Carmen a close second - and the theatrical permutations of people-moving. In smaller auditoria such as the one at Torre del Lago near Puccini's villa, the composer's music is more audible, wafting across the lake where he shot wildfowl con brio. Here too, the elements bring their hazards. There is nothing a well-bred mosquito likes better than a nice succulent opera-goer on a hot, summer's night. Wear your dandiest outfit, certainly, but take your seat without anointing yourself from head to toe in insect repellent and you will be scratching away as rhythmically as the second violins for days to come.

Last week's snide reference to gay people as The Gays is offensive and out of touch. Millions of gay people reject marriage. But, far more important, is the right to simple, legal parity for partners in a relationship whether gay, straight, married or unmarried. Joanna Walters London EC1 Populist demand Andrew Marr (Comment, last week) uses the word 'populist' six times (and your leader on the same page uses it twice) to denote any kind of unprincipled vote-catching. But 100 years ago the American People's Party, or Populists, were mounting a principled and complex challenge to conventional politics. Starting as a small-farmers' organisation against the 'middlemen', the Populists became an all-round anti-monopoly movement, focusing on the banks and railroads. The anti-trust laws that are giving Bill Gates so much grief stem from the moment Populism crossed over into conventional politics. Were William Hague, Ken Livingstone and Steven Norris really Populists we would be on the verge of radical change.

      "body": "<p>Although they were quite good at whacking people in the old days, the Jesuits never taught us about the 'double whammy'. It was left to Chris Patten, a Benedictine, to introduce the phrase into English parlance. </p> <p>For some time I have had a nagging feeling there may be some kind of link between Labour's current economic policies and the concept of the double whammy. But when I have asked users of the term what it means, they have, as it were, been lost for words. </p> <p>The wonderful Information Resource Center at the United States Embassy has come to the rescue: a double whammy is 'a double portion of something, especially something troublesome'. It appears in dictionaries of American slang, and Al Capp's Li'l Abner, the cartoon strip, is cited as a source. </p> <p>The pound has risen so high that in itself it constitutes a double, or perhaps triple whammy. The mass redundancies threatened at Longbridge, Dagenham and, now it seems, Llanwern (the steel industry), are caused by a number of factors, but few people now disagree that a common factor is the high pound. </p> <p>Despite the Government's attempt to blame it on the euro, the fact of the matter is that the Government has not conducted economic policy in a way that makes avoidance of an overvalued pound a serious objective. Intervention in the exchange markets has been eschewed; and, for all the Chancellor's brilliance in producing a fiscal surplus, one is reminded of the days when fiscal surpluses were cited as a reason why taxes should not be raised to curb a consumer and house price boom, and too much reliance was placed on the 'single club' of interest rates, during the Lawson boom of the late Eighties. </p> <p>But there is another, separate whammy exacerbating these industrial troubles: it is New Labour's embrace of the nearest it can get to US-style labour laws. The Government espouses free markets and an easy hire-and-fire approach. When multinationals make their decisions in response to, say, overcapacity in the car or steel industries, it is easier to fire and shut down in the UK than it is in most Continental countries. </p> <p>Thus from the point of view of the likely social distress and political trouble to come from plant closures in the Labour heartlands, the free-market approach to the value of the pound, and the much-vaunted 'flexible labour market' in Britain can be seen as a multiple whammy. </p> <p>At a superficial level, the Government resembles Labour governments of old. Indeed, some siren voices have been raised recently warning Messrs Blair and Byers of the follies of contemplating a return to the bad old days, when uneconomic firms were almost routinely propped up by the Government in time of crisis. </p> <p>But the problem with the overvalued pound - and it now seems to be every bit as overvalued as it was in the sado-monetarist period of 1980-81 - is that it affects not only uneconomic, so-called 'sunset' or 'old economy' industries: it affects every manufacturer. Last week, for example, Toshiba, not widely known for producing uneconomic coal, described the level of sterling as 'unbearable'. </p> <p>There is accumulating evidence that firms are surviving by re-sourcing their supplies from abroad, and the Confederation of British Industry warns it is not only investment by foreign firms that is threatened by present uncompetitive pound. </p> <p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) was clearly alive to fears that sterling might rise even higher when it left interest rates unchanged last week. </p> <p>The MPC has been much praised for its achievement of the 2.5 per cent inflation target, yet the Treasury warns us wage earnings are rising at 6.2 per cent per annum and 'real earnings' are shooting up at rates reminiscent of the Lawson boom.

      "bodyText": "Although they were quite good at whacking people in the old days, the Jesuits never taught us about the 'double whammy'. It was left to Chris Patten, a Benedictine, to introduce the phrase into English parlance. For some time I have had a nagging feeling there may be some kind of link between Labour's current economic policies and the concept of the double whammy. But when I have asked users of the term what it means, they have, as it were, been lost for words. The wonderful Information Resource Center at the United States Embassy has come to the rescue: a double whammy is 'a double portion of something, especially something troublesome'. It appears in dictionaries of American slang, and Al Capp's Li'l Abner, the cartoon strip, is cited as a source. The pound has risen so high that in itself it constitutes a double, or perhaps triple whammy. The mass redundancies threatened at Longbridge, Dagenham and, now it seems, Llanwern (the steel industry), are caused by a number of factors, but few people now disagree that a common factor is the high pound. Despite the Government's attempt to blame it on the euro, the fact of the matter is that the Government has not conducted economic policy in a way that makes avoidance of an overvalued pound a serious objective. Intervention in the exchange markets has been eschewed; and, for all the Chancellor's brilliance in producing a fiscal surplus, one is reminded of the days when fiscal surpluses were cited as a reason why taxes should not be raised to curb a consumer and house price boom, and too much reliance was placed on the 'single club' of interest rates, during the Lawson boom of the late Eighties. But there is another, separate whammy exacerbating these industrial troubles: it is New Labour's embrace of the nearest it can get to US-style labour laws. The Government espouses free markets and an easy hire-and-fire approach. When multinationals make their decisions in response to, say, overcapacity in the car or steel industries, it is easier to fire and shut down in the UK than it is in most Continental countries. Thus from the point of view of the likely social distress and political trouble to come from plant closures in the Labour heartlands, the free-market approach to the value of the pound, and the much-vaunted 'flexible labour market' in Britain can be seen as a multiple whammy. At a superficial level, the Government resembles Labour governments of old. Indeed, some siren voices have been raised recently warning Messrs Blair and Byers of the follies of contemplating a return to the bad old days, when uneconomic firms were almost routinely propped up by the Government in time of crisis. But the problem with the overvalued pound - and it now seems to be every bit as overvalued as it was in the sado-monetarist period of 1980-81 - is that it affects not only uneconomic, so-called 'sunset' or 'old economy' industries: it affects every manufacturer. Last week, for example, Toshiba, not widely known for producing uneconomic coal, described the level of sterling as 'unbearable'. There is accumulating evidence that firms are surviving by re-sourcing their supplies from abroad, and the Confederation of British Industry warns it is not only investment by foreign firms that is threatened by present uncompetitive pound. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) was clearly alive to fears that sterling might rise even higher when it left interest rates unchanged last week. The MPC has been much praised for its achievement of the 2.5 per cent inflation target, yet the Treasury warns us wage earnings are rising at 6.2 per cent per annum and 'real earnings' are shooting up at rates reminiscent of the Lawson boom. Try as they will, the official statisticians cannot find the underlying productivity improvements to justify this trend. The truth that can only just dare to speak its name is that it is the overvaluation of sterling that has enabled the MPC to achieve the inflation target. Eddie George can hardly appear in public now without warning that a devaluation of sterling would probably force the MPC to raise interest rates. This would be in order to offset the inflationary impact of a devaluation. I sniff another double whammy lurking here somewhere. Last week the Prime Minister declared: 'The worst thing we could do is to try artificially to devalue the currency.' Yet the currency is artificially high, and causing serious damage. What it boils down to is that the Government has not been nearly as successful with the economy as the conventional wisdom has supposed.

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone yesterday underlined his determination to bring a new kind of politics to London by appointing a radical black activist to his mayoral Cabinet. Lee Jasper, a Brixton community leader, has been given responsibility for race relations and liaison with the Metropolitan Police. The capital's first elected Mayor has also told Tony Blair he will be apply to rejoin the Labour Party this year. The appointment of Jasper was made within hours of a friendly 20-minute telephone conversation between Livingstone and the Prime Minister, in which both promised to work together. Blair promised Livingstone co-operation from Labour, despite a hard-fought election campaign in which the Prime Minister repeatedly warned voters that the left-winger was unfit to be Mayor. Livingstone repeated his wish to be allowed back into the party, having been expelled for a minimum of five years for running against Labour's official candidate, Frank Dobson. Speaking exclusively, Livingstone told The Observer: 'I said I would be applying to join, but I didn't want to embarrass him. I'd wait, and clearly he'd want to wait and see how I'd perform as Mayor. We'll think about it after the summer. I know a lot of people in the party want me back in, and I'm sure there'll be some sort of debate about this at the party conference.' Several London Labour constituency parties are expected to try to use the autumn conference to force through a vote ending Livingstone's exile. But party officials insist there is no prospect of Livingstone rejoining before 2005. Livingstone's decision to turn to Jasper, rather than the better known former TV presenter Trevor Phillips, as the main voice of London's black community, will increase Labour's nervousness about whether they can work with the new Mayor. A jokey comment by Jasper was one of the main weapons used by Labour against Livingstone during the campaign. When The Observer first reported the possibility of Jasper's appointment, he joked that it would have senior officers at Scotland Yard 'tearing their hair out'. Livingstone said yesterday: 'Lee, like me, has learnt that having a sense of humour is not compatible with public life. I don't want people around me who don't have a sense of humour. He has been working with the Met as an adviser for years. They are very impressed with him.' Livingstone will open negotiations this week with the nine Labour members of the Greater London Assembly over the appointment of a Deputy Mayor. Yesterday he offered the post to Labour assembly member Nicky Gavron. Livingstone is upset that Phillips' former press officer Adrian McMenamin arranged for a complaint about Livingstone's \u00a3160,000 annual earnings from speeches and journalism to go to the Commissioner for Standards and Privileges, earning him a public rebuke. Livingstone vowed yesterday never to use one of the Mayor's perks: a chauffeur driven car. He will travel to work by Tube. 'I renewed my season ticket,' he said.",

      "bodyText": "A private military company accused of human rights abuses has been awarded lucrative Government contracts to clear unexploded mines and cluster bombs in Kosovo, The Observer can reveal. The decision, taken by International Development Secretary Clare Short, has infuriated MPs, charities and anti-arms trade campaigners. Since the end of the Kosovo conflict, the Government has awarded two mine-clearance contracts worth more than \u00a31 million to Defence Systems, a London-based firm, founded by former senior SAS officer Alistair Morrison, which has been involved in a spate of human rights controversies. United Nations' special rapporteur, Enrique Ballesteros, stated in a 1998 report that it was concerned about DSL's alleged 'mercenary' activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. DSL's activities in Colombia, where it has been employed by BP to protect its multi-billion pound interests, have long been a concern to human rights organisations. In 1998 it was expelled from Angola for alleged 'illegal activities'. DSL also recommended Sandline International - the firm involved in the arms-to-Sierra Leone scandal - to the government of Papua New Guinea when it needed mercenary help. Labour MP Ann Clwyd, a member of the House of Commons International Development Select Committee, will raise questions in Parliament this week. 'Why are we giving taxpayers' money to a firm with a record like DSL so that it can make a profit out of clearing mines in Kosovo?' said Clwyd. 'I want to know what checks were done by the Government.' Since April 1997, DSL has been owned by US security giant Armor Holdings, which sells body armour and riot control equipment. Richard Lloyd, director of the UK working group on land mines, is concerned that firms like DSL are using land mine clearance as a way to gain respectability. Lloyd said: 'The operation in Kosovo is highly sensitive. Aid organisations and charities are experienced and well-equipped to deal with this, but questions have to be asked about whether the same can be said of a militaristic private company with a dodgy track record.' The Campaign Against the Arms Trade will also protest against the DSL contract. DSL has used former British servicemen to offer protection against kidnapping, espionage and terrorism to multinationals operating in 'risky' regions. Nigel Woof, Armor's vice chairman of marketing, dismisses allegations of human rights abuses against DSL. He said DSL is not only used by private corporations but by the UN, human aid groups and Western governments to protect embassies. Woof said: 'We have never, and will never be involved in mercenary activities. We are proud of what we do and operate a disciplined and ethical operation.' However, accusations of human rights abuses have been hard to shake off. It was alleged that DSL trained Colombian police in counter-insurgency techniques using ex-SAS personnel and fed intelligence on anyone opposed to BP to Columbia's 14th brigade - a group of soldiers with a record of atrocities including the massacre of 43 people in 1988. A report by the Parliamentary Human Rights Group entitled 'The Business of Killing' said the main concern was that DSL passed on information on environmentalists and community leaders. Both DSL and BP claimed the only training they gave was defensive. But documents obtained by the Guardian showed that a senior DSL employee, Roger Brown, was in charge of security for the 520-mile Ocensa oil pipeline in Colombia, in which BP is a major shareholder. Brown was a key figure in a proposed pipeline protection project with the 14th Brigade and Israeli security company Silver Shadow, involving attack helicopters and the 'direct supply of anti-guerrilla special weaponry'. When this came to light, BP suspended Brown, who until recently continued to work for DSL. DSL is one of five companies to be awarded mine-clearance contracts worth \u00a313.5m in Kosovo. A spokesman for the International Development Department said: 'We deplore the use of and training of mercenaries, but there was no evidence that DSL should not be granted the contract.'",

Three days into Scotland's biggest ever murder trial, in a specially constructed court at Camp van Zeist in the Netherlands, some relatives have accused prosecutors of ignoring their needs with a deci sion effectively denying them the opportunity to hear crucial testimony.

Relatives, spread around 16 countries, have repeatedly asked family liaison officials for advance notice of witnesses to allow them time to get to the court or to one of four remote sites set up in the US and Britain to offer them closed circuit viewing.

      "body": "<p>Marina de Larrocoechea did not sleep a wink on Tuesday night. Understandable perhaps, after the discomfort of a flight from New York to the Netherlands, but it was not jet lag that kept her awake. It was the anxiety of knowing that within a few hours, after 11 years of grief, struggle and disappointment, two men would go on trial for the murder of her sister, Nieves.</p> <p>On 21 December, 1988, the Basque air stewardess was killed along with 269 others when a bomb concealed inside a Toshiba radio cassette recorder tore through a Pan Am jumbo jet and sent the blazing wreckage raining down on Lockerbie.</p> <p>In the full glare of the world's media, the trial of the two Libyans accused of the bombing finally got under way last week in a specially constructed Scottish court in Holland, but behind the legal manoeuvrings and the enormous quantity of coverage generated by Scotland's biggest-ever murder case are bereaved relatives like De Larrocoechea.</p> <p>After more than a decade of shunning media attention to concentrate on battling to have those responsible brought to justice, she agreed last week to give The Observer an insight into how it felt to sit in court and listen while the full horror of a loved one's death was reconstructed in graphic detail.</p> <p>'The only thing worse than having to go through all this now is the fact that the bombing happened in the first place,' she said. 'I wish things could be as they were on 20 December 1988 but this is my reality now and I have to see it through.'</p> <p>Like other relatives of the victims, the 52-year-old designer arrived at Camp van Zeist, a former US air base eight miles from Utrecht, early on Wednesday morning for the opening of the trial which kicked off a little after 10.30 am.</p> <p>Like the other relatives, she sat in silence in the public gallery as the two Libyans, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al- Megrahi, 48, and Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah, 34, pleaded not guilty to murder and conspiracy to murder. And like the other relatives it was the first time she had seen in person the accused, who were dressed in their national costume of white robes and dark skullcaps. But De Larrocoechea is not like the other relatives in at least one crucial respect: she has grave doubts that the Libyans were involved at all.</p> <p>'I am having great difficulty accepting these men as the bombers, and I'm having an even harder time believing they were acting alone if they were in it at all,' she said. 'One of the American relatives turned to me and said, \"I finally know what a mass murderer looks like.\" But I can't make such hard statements about them. They are two guys in the middle of this enormous international intrigue.'</p> <p>Nor does she have much confidence in the prosecution. She has tried and failed to get the court to allow independent legal representation for the relatives in the trial because she fears that the prosecution will be prevented by considerations of national interest from bringing out the full story of Flight 103's destruction. She also fears that it will not address allegations that the US government failed to make public the warnings from terrorist groups in the run-up to the tragedy that an American airline would be targeted.</p> <p>'If my sister had told me that there had been bomb threats but she was going to get on the plane because she didn't take them seriously, then things would be completely different. At least she would have had the choice, she would have been in control of her own life. Instead she and the other people on the plane were allowed to be massacred.'</p> <p>Despite her misgivings, however, she was relieved when the trial got under way after months of delay. 'It is absolutely necessary. If nothing else it is the only thing we have left out of all the original scenarios. At last we can see what the Crown have come up with and how far they are prepared to go with it.'</p> <p>For her and the other relatives - mainly American - the evidence of the first three days was hard. Slowly and in painful detail, the Lord Advocate, Colin Boyd, has reconstructed the events leading up to the explosion on Flight 103 and the horrific aftermath as it fell on Lockerbie.</p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon a palpable chill ran through the public gallery as the court silently watched on television screens the moment when the plane disappeared off the radar to be replaced by traces of wreckage spreading over south-west Scotland. One American, Susan Cohen, whose 20-year-old daughter Theodora was killed, was so upset by the image that she left the room uncertain whether she would be strong enough to return at all.</p> <p>But De Larrocoechea found the image easier to deal with. Not only had she seen it at the Scottish fatal accident inquiry but she has made herself face far more graphic evidence since, like the terrible police photographs she still has of the carnage on the ground.

      "bodyText": "Marina de Larrocoechea did not sleep a wink on Tuesday night. Understandable perhaps, after the discomfort of a flight from New York to the Netherlands, but it was not jet lag that kept her awake. It was the anxiety of knowing that within a few hours, after 11 years of grief, struggle and disappointment, two men would go on trial for the murder of her sister, Nieves. On 21 December, 1988, the Basque air stewardess was killed along with 269 others when a bomb concealed inside a Toshiba radio cassette recorder tore through a Pan Am jumbo jet and sent the blazing wreckage raining down on Lockerbie. In the full glare of the world's media, the trial of the two Libyans accused of the bombing finally got under way last week in a specially constructed Scottish court in Holland, but behind the legal manoeuvrings and the enormous quantity of coverage generated by Scotland's biggest-ever murder case are bereaved relatives like De Larrocoechea. After more than a decade of shunning media attention to concentrate on battling to have those responsible brought to justice, she agreed last week to give The Observer an insight into how it felt to sit in court and listen while the full horror of a loved one's death was reconstructed in graphic detail. 'The only thing worse than having to go through all this now is the fact that the bombing happened in the first place,' she said. 'I wish things could be as they were on 20 December 1988 but this is my reality now and I have to see it through.' Like other relatives of the victims, the 52-year-old designer arrived at Camp van Zeist, a former US air base eight miles from Utrecht, early on Wednesday morning for the opening of the trial which kicked off a little after 10.30 am. Like the other relatives, she sat in silence in the public gallery as the two Libyans, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al- Megrahi, 48, and Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah, 34, pleaded not guilty to murder and conspiracy to murder. And like the other relatives it was the first time she had seen in person the accused, who were dressed in their national costume of white robes and dark skullcaps. But De Larrocoechea is not like the other relatives in at least one crucial respect: she has grave doubts that the Libyans were involved at all. 'I am having great difficulty accepting these men as the bombers, and I'm having an even harder time believing they were acting alone if they were in it at all,' she said. 'One of the American relatives turned to me and said, \"I finally know what a mass murderer looks like.\" But I can't make such hard statements about them. They are two guys in the middle of this enormous international intrigue.' Nor does she have much confidence in the prosecution. She has tried and failed to get the court to allow independent legal representation for the relatives in the trial because she fears that the prosecution will be prevented by considerations of national interest from bringing out the full story of Flight 103's destruction. She also fears that it will not address allegations that the US government failed to make public the warnings from terrorist groups in the run-up to the tragedy that an American airline would be targeted. 'If my sister had told me that there had been bomb threats but she was going to get on the plane because she didn't take them seriously, then things would be completely different. At least she would have had the choice, she would have been in control of her own life. Instead she and the other people on the plane were allowed to be massacred.' Despite her misgivings, however, she was relieved when the trial got under way after months of delay. 'It is absolutely necessary. If nothing else it is the only thing we have left out of all the original scenarios. At last we can see what the Crown have come up with and how far they are prepared to go with it.' For her and the other relatives - mainly American - the evidence of the first three days was hard. Slowly and in painful detail, the Lord Advocate, Colin Boyd, has reconstructed the events leading up to the explosion on Flight 103 and the horrific aftermath as it fell on Lockerbie. On Wednesday afternoon a palpable chill ran through the public gallery as the court silently watched on television screens the moment when the plane disappeared off the radar to be replaced by traces of wreckage spreading over south-west Scotland. One American, Susan Cohen, whose 20-year-old daughter Theodora was killed, was so upset by the image that she left the room uncertain whether she would be strong enough to return at all. But De Larrocoechea found the image easier to deal with. Not only had she seen it at the Scottish fatal accident inquiry but she has made herself face far more graphic evidence since, like the terrible police photographs she still has of the carnage on the ground. Indeed, hardened by the ordeal of the last decade, she came to Camp van Zeist convinced that nothing could still get to her. It took just one word to undermine those defences. On Thursday morning the court was hearing from eyewitnesses who, one by one, outlined in ghastly simplicity the fireball, the mushroom cloud and the other details of the devastation which hit Lockerbie. The prosecution case was cleverly constructed, starting with an eyewitness over the border near Carlisle and steadily focusing closer and closer to the town and the evidence of witnesses on streets where the wreckage fell. Jasmine Bell, a social work assistant at the time, had been delivering Christmas food parcels in the Rosebank area of town when a piece of fuselage hit the streets she was in. Wading through the debris on the pavement with her son shortly after one of them had stumbled, she told the court. 'We looked down and my son said, \"What is that, mum?\" and my first reaction was, \"It's OK, it's just meat.\" Then it registered that it wasn't meat.' 'It was such a brutal description, the word meat,' said De Larrocoechea. 'I didn't expect to be upset by anything, but my stomach just shrank when she said that. My entire system wrenched. In a way that is good though. I don't want to blot out the horror of that night. This was a horrendous massacre and it must be discussed as such.' There were other traumatic moments. On Friday afternoon the court listened for a full hour as the complete list of victims was read out.

'That was difficult, but not as difficult as living with it every day,' she said as she left the court afterwards.

Bruce Smith, a retired airline pilot who lost his wife Ingrid, emerged from the court after listening to the crash evidence and complained: 'I know that to find diamonds you have to go through a couple of tons of gravel, but today we have gone through three tons of gravel and we've only found a couple of tiny diamonds.' De Larrocoechea is willing to be more patient. 'The American relatives better fasten their seatbelts, because this is going to be a very long ride. The Crown has to set up the case, and there is a real contradiction with some of the relatives. They know that this could take at least a year and they have accepted that, but it just to seems to make them more anxious and impatient on a day-to-day basis.' Already, however, there have been the first glimpses of the real battleground upon which this case will be fought.

But even if the prosecution comes up with a case that convinces me the Libyans really are guilty, and even if they are then found guilty, we will still only be one step closer to justice.'",

In Catholic circles, this is known as grace through observance - the conviction that, if you go through the motions long enough, you'll eventually develop faith. It's a charming notion - even to a non-believer like me. But does it work? 'I started off cynically; I wanted to get my child into the school,' said Tina. 'So I went to Mass every week. But my attitude towards it gradually changed. I started to believe again. My child has brought me back to the faith of my own childhood.' As for me, I was born a Catholic atheist and intend staying that way. My wife is a Jewish atheist. Between them, our three children have attended 14 schools, including two religious ones. My half-Catholic, half-Jewish son became head boy of his Church of England primary school. Now he's given up eating pork. Grace through observance, kosher-style?",

      "body": "<p>This is a story of something that happened in the middle of the night on an obstetrics ward at a large London hospital. It's a true story, told to me by a doctor who wants to remain anonymous, and who was then in the early stages of her career. Like all junior doctors, she was working ridiculously long hours. She had just one day off in every fortnight and was lucky if she cleared two hours sleep a night. She was overworked and sleep deprived. Completely standard, given the job.</p> <p>On this night, the doctor - I'll call her Sarah Carter - was called to the labour ward. A woman in labour, with a history of complications, had developed worryingly high blood-pressure levels. Dr Carter prepared to administer a drug to lower the blood pressure. She gave instructions to prepare the drug to the nurse at the scene, who measured out and prepared the dose, then handed the drug to the doctor, which is the standard procedure. Dr Carter administered the drug And then all hell broke loose.</p> <p>Dr Carter had asked for the recommended oral dose of the drug, but then administered it intravenously. The nurse who prepared the medicine had opened three pre-measured vials to fulfil the doctor's request. It was an unusually large amount to put in a syringe, but she said nothing. Who knows why? Maybe she was worried about contradicting a doctor. Dr Carter took the syringe without thinking - she hadn't seen the three vials being opened and hadn't realised that she'd automatically asked for an oral dose.</p> <p>The patient's blood pressure dropped dramatically, and so did the baby's. The situation quickly became dangerous. It was by now 2am. Emergency telephone calls were made, the anaesthetist and registrar were woken up, dragged from their beds and rushed to the scene. The baby was in extreme distress and the ward was swarming with senior doctors. An emergency Caesarean was performed.</p> <p>There was urgent work to be done helping the baby to breathe, but this time the outcome was a good one. The mother and baby were fine. Dr Carter was not. 'I was completely traumatised by the whole experience. I thought I would have to leave medicine, that I just couldn't take the possible consequences of a mistake. And I realised how easy the mistake had been to make.'</p> <p>It has been estimated that as many as 33,000 people die in Britain every year as a result of medical errors or accidents. Nobody knows how many near misses there are - mistakes, like Dr Carter's, caught in time to prevent serious injury - but doctors themselves admit they are ubiquitous. Until very recently, these numbers were not acknowledged or discussed. Every accident was treated as an anomaly, a shocking and terrible one-off. The truth - that all doctors make mistakes, including the very best ones - is not what patients want to hear, but it was all that kept Dr Carter in medicine. 'I was upset and depressed about it for months, but I gradually came to realise that this was the kind of mistake that happens all the time. It wasn't a one-off caused by an incompetent - me - but the kind of everyday error that is rife throughout the whole medical system.'</p> <p>That knowledge is only just hitting the rest of us. A recent spate of high profile and extraordinary cases has focused the full beam of public and media attention on medical mistakes as never before: the scandal of the paediatric heart surgeons at Bristol Royal Infirmary; the case of the surgeon in west Wales who removed the wrong kidney from his patient, causing the patient's death. Even Harold Shipman, the GP who killed at least 15 of his elderly patients deliberately rather than accidentally, exposed a reality we prefer to deny. According to Dr Ian Bogle, who is chairman of the British Medical Association, 'It's a very rare doctor who will get through his or her career without making serious mistakes. The conditions under which doctors work, and the very nature of medicine, means errors are inevitable.'</p> <p>The nature of medicine means that doctors work under extreme pressure, situations are often urgent, and decisions have to be made in seconds. Under those conditions, what is an error? Removing the wrong kidney is pretty unequivocal, but medicine is an imprecise science. Sometimes we blame error for an unwanted outcome, when the error is an error of judgement, but then only with hindsight. Dr Nick Cheshire, a vascular consultant at St Mary's hospital in Paddington describes the daily judgement calls that may or may not turn out well. 'A patient presents with blocked arteries in his leg and a potential risk of developing gangrene. If we leave the patient as he is there may be a 20 per cent or higher risk to his life over the next year. If we operate, there may be a 5 per cent risk to his life - but that's tomorrow morning; 5 per cent may not sound like a high risk, but if you or a member of your family is one of those 5 per cent, that's 100 per cent as far as you're concerned.'</p> <p>The government and the General Medical Council (GMC) are rushing through new legislation and systems designed to reduce errors and protect patients, which is what we all want. But there is one group of people, profoundly affected by the consequences of medical mistakes, being overlooked in this rush of reform: the doctors who make them. </p> <p>Medical errors are often traumatic or tragic for patients, but they are also devastating for doctors. Depression, breakdown, leaving the profession and even suicide are common responses among doctors to their own mistakes. It's a high price to pay for the risks we ask them to take every day. Of course, we need protection from bad or incompetent doctors. But what about the good doctors, whose split-second mistakes can have equally terrible consequences? There's no helpline for traumatised doctors, no on-site counselling service or 'buddy' system where they can deal with their guilt and shame. When Dr Carter made her mistake, her impulse was to apologise to the patient 'but there just wasn't any procedure for it. I was discouraged from talking about it at all. It was made plain that I'd made a mistake and that I wasn't to make it again, but beyond that it was kind of bad form to want to discuss it. By the next day, I was expected to be over it, and to just get on with it.'</p> <p>It wasn't callousness that made her superiors ignore her distress, but the long-standing tradition of silence about mistakes in medicine, driven by guilt and shame, by fear of the consequences and by the 'hero' culture in which doctors feel they can't admit weaknesses or failings, either to each other or to their patients. In an age of awesome technological sophistication, we can't accept how little we still know about our own biology or the limitations of medicine. The pressure on doctors to live up to impossible patient expectations is immense. </p> <p>Sir Donald Irvine, president of the GMC describes 'the powerful collusion between doctor and patient to perpetrate the myth of infallibility', and Dr Marc de Leval, a leading cardiac surgeon, says: 'The need to perform faultlessly has created a strong pressure for intellectual dishonesty to cover up mistakes, rather than admit them.'</p> <p>In March, the British Medical Journal (BMJ) devoted an entire issue to the subject of medical errors, fingering a deeply entrenched culture of 'blame and punish' as the biggest deterrent to reducing them, producing an atmosphere of fear, shame and secrecy. In one article, the BMJ describes doctors as 'the second victim' of medical error, often paying for a mistake with their mental health, marriages and livelihoods. And it's a unique pressure. There isn't another profession where mistakes are so poorly tolerated or understood, or the price paid for them so high. We may live in a global age, but we're still applying Old Testament standards to doctors. In law, or the media, there's only one response to a doctor who makes a serious mistake: name them, shame them, take them to court and if possible get them struck off. Of course, doctors have to be accountable for their mistakes. But it's a system that helps neither doctor nor patient, and does nothing to make medicine safer. According to the BMJ, 'The easy, understandable and completely wrong answer is to blame those who made the mistake.'</p> <p>Faced with the human suffering of a victim and their family, it may be a natural human impulse to need somebody to blame. But it won't stop the same mistake from happening to somebody else. We can reduce medical error, but it requires a process that doesn't just involve individual doctors and the health service, but a redefining of the whole culture of medicine and the unwritten contract between doctor and patient. Sir Donald Irvine sums up a fundamental change in attitude: 'We've got to move away from picking up mistakes after they happen, to the business of asking why they happen.'</p> <p>According to Matthew Pitt, a consultant at Great Ormond Street Hospital, and part of the hospital's working group on clinical risk, blaming a doctor for errors ignores the fact that many - maybe most - mistakes are the result of a series of system errors that come together with potentially disastrous consequences. 'It's common for doctors to feel that errors are entirely their own fault. Cool reflection will often bring to light a system dysfunction that has placed the doctor at risk on the front line.'</p> <p>System dysfunction can mean anything from a missing set of notes to a pharmaceutical company suddenly changing the colour of the label on a drug. In Dr Carter's case, the system allowed oral and intravenous doses to be easily mixed up. The nurse was only required to check that the dosage was accurate according to the doctor's instructions - there was no check that the instruction was accurate in the first place. She was failed again by her working conditions. According to Pitt, 'The mistake when the junior doctor has been up for 24 hours is an obvious example. The overbooked outpatient clinic or operating list are other scenarios where error is more likely.'</p> <p>Another young doctor describes her own most terrifying near-miss. 'When patients are nil-by-mouth they are often hooked up to a saline drip. It's common to add potassium to about every third bag of solution. I was asked to do that, only instead of adding the potassium to the bag I injected it directly into the patient's vein - 10ml of potassium chloride straight into a vein is a very good way to kill somebody.' The emergency team were called and the patient was saved, but it might easily have been otherwise. It was a standard, low-risk procedure, but the doctor had been administering injections all day, and had been on duty for 15 hours.</p> <p>Reducing mistakes to the nitty-gritty detailed steps that cause them - the 'systems' approach, rather than a 'person- centred' approach is becoming the great white hope of improving medical safety. It isn't an attempt to make excuses for doctors or to release anyone from their personal responsibility. Instead, it acknowledges that all human beings are fallible, and will sooner or later make mistakes, so systems must be designed that prevent these mistakes from having disastrous consequences. If errors are predictable, they become preventable.</p> <p>The person-centred model - which views doctors as 'choosing' between safe and unsafe behaviour - dominates medicine, and has produced the blame and shame culture. Writing in the BMJ, Professor James Reason, the world's leading authority on human error described it as an approach that is only 'likely to thwart the development of safer healthcare'. In a systems approach, he argues, the focus is not on who made the mistake, but how and why the defences designed to prevent it have failed. It's based, he says, 'on the assumption that we cannot change the human condition, but we can change the conditions in which humans work.'</p> <p>Not all mistakes are fatal, but every mistake is potentially dangerous, and the possibility for mistakes - and the fear of their consequences - is present everyday, at every consultation, even the most simple and apparently straightforward. Professor Brian Jarman from the Imperial College Medical School in London was a GP for many years, and describes two stories, representative of hundreds like them, which could have led to him being the subject of a serious complaint.</p> <p>'I had one patient, a young woman. I found her behaviour to be somewhat seductive and inappropriate - just the alarm bells of experience. She seemed to me to be requesting an unusually high number of vaginal examinations, and I thought it best to discreetly warn the other members of my practice. Unfortunately, the warning didn't reach our most junior member in time, and sure enough, he found himself the subject of a very nasty complaint for sexual misconduct. It was absolutely traumatising for him, but luckily the complaint was thrown out when it was discovered that she had made something like 27 similar complaints over a very short period of time.</p> <p>'In another case, a lady came to see us to have her ears syringed before going on holiday. The practice nurse did it, although she wasn't really supposed to without permission from a doctor. While on holiday, this lady had her ears syringed again. Later she developed an ear infection, and her union recommended she sued me, as her GP, for causing the infection. Even though I'd never even treated her, I was held responsible.' The patient declined to complain for common-sense reasons, but others don't.</p> <p>Complaints against doctors can take from one to 10 years, and although the complaints procedure was improved in 1996 it remains difficult and unsatisfactory for most patients, and an ordeal for most doctors - whether they are found guilty or not. One GP from the Midlands describes his experience of a recent complaint. 'I had a patient who was a 97-year-old woman. I visited her at home as she was complaining of back pain - it was likely to be caused by one of two things: a collapsed vertebrae or bone cancer. In both cases, there is no instant or obvious treatment. As I was going on holiday the next day, I arranged for a very good locum to visit her within a few days. In that time, the patient developed a cough and a chest infection, which eventually turned into pneumonia. She was admitted to hospital, but she sadly died.'</p> <p>Her husband - 98 years old and bereft - complained that the doctor had failed to spot his wife's chest complaint, and that failure to treat it sooner had led to her death. The family made an official complaint to the Community Health Council, which took 15 months to complete. In that time, the GP carried on working 'although the stress of the complaint affected me terribly. Everybody at the practice knew about the complaint, and although my colleagues were supportive, I felt under a cloud of suspicion. I questioned my own capabilities and judgement, and tormented myself with the thought that I had somehow failed this family although I knew that I'd done all I could do, and I'd only seen the poor woman once.</p> <p>'When the day of the hearing for the complaint finally arrived I was shaking, and I hadn't slept. The law, and the complaints procedure, is supposed to be neutral. But all through those 15 months I felt that the onus was on me to prove myself. We're very patient-centred, which I support, but it means the doctor feels guilty until proven innocent.' The complaint was not upheld , but the GP, with 25 years of exemplary service to his name, has been so traumatised by the experience that he is now looking for a job outside medicine.</p> <p>According to Dr Gerard Panting, a GP who also works for the Medical Protection Society, one result of the fear of the consequences of a medical mistake has been the rise in 'defensive medicine'. 'Doctors end up not trusting their own judgement. If a patient has a simple headache, they may order a brain scan and a battery of other tests just to protect themselves in case that headache one day turns out to be something more serious. It happens a great deal in America, where fear of legislation is forcing all doctors to work this way, and it's happening here.' Costs spiral, and the patient is subjected to tests they don't need.</p> <p>Until recently, doctors operated their own code of omert\u00e0. Prior to 1995 and the publication of Good Medical Practice, doctors worked to the principle that they should never disparage their colleagues, and should only report another doctor as a last resort, in cases of really serious professional misconduct, if then. But it is changing. As it struggles to develop legal, cultural and moral responses to its technological miracles and to adapt to the speed of those miracles as well as the pace of social change, we're struggling with it. What do we want doctors to be? Equal partners in our healthcare? Or supernaturally gifted healers? The problem for them is that we want both. They may be idolised or demonised, but doctors are no longer undisputed authorities. While we still expect them to perform miracles, patient power - boosted by a more 'consumer' attitude towards medicine - is transforming the culture of the consulting room. At the same time, a whole raft of new guidelines and legislation is being introduced, which means that doctors will be regulated at unprecedented levels. For the first time, doctors can expect to be appraised and reviewed. </p> <p>The GMC's Best Medical Practice is now unequivocal in requiring doctors to report each others adverse behaviour or performance. It says: 'You must protect patients when you believe a doctor's health, conduct or performance is a threat to them. Protecting their own at any price is going the way of Doctor Knows Best.'</p> <p>But there is also a new, if tentative, acknowledgement that the best way to protect patients is to support doctors. At Great Ormond Street, there is a pilot scheme called the Professional Standards Advisory Group, where any health care professional can discuss any aspect of errors or safety in confidence. Near misses can be reported, worries about colleagues can be discussed, and the good doctors who make mistakes can be helped to come to terms with them. Other hospitals are looking at similar schemes, and there is a general, if painfully slow, move towards glasnost across the whole area.</p> <p>Changing the blame culture doesn't mean that doctors won't be held responsible for their actions, or that the effects of their mistakes are not fully or properly acknowledged.

      "bodyText": "This is a story of something that happened in the middle of the night on an obstetrics ward at a large London hospital. It's a true story, told to me by a doctor who wants to remain anonymous, and who was then in the early stages of her career. Like all junior doctors, she was working ridiculously long hours. She had just one day off in every fortnight and was lucky if she cleared two hours sleep a night. She was overworked and sleep deprived. Completely standard, given the job. On this night, the doctor - I'll call her Sarah Carter - was called to the labour ward. A woman in labour, with a history of complications, had developed worryingly high blood-pressure levels. Dr Carter prepared to administer a drug to lower the blood pressure. She gave instructions to prepare the drug to the nurse at the scene, who measured out and prepared the dose, then handed the drug to the doctor, which is the standard procedure. Dr Carter administered the drug And then all hell broke loose. Dr Carter had asked for the recommended oral dose of the drug, but then administered it intravenously. The nurse who prepared the medicine had opened three pre-measured vials to fulfil the doctor's request. It was an unusually large amount to put in a syringe, but she said nothing. Who knows why? Maybe she was worried about contradicting a doctor. Dr Carter took the syringe without thinking - she hadn't seen the three vials being opened and hadn't realised that she'd automatically asked for an oral dose. The patient's blood pressure dropped dramatically, and so did the baby's. The situation quickly became dangerous. It was by now 2am. Emergency telephone calls were made, the anaesthetist and registrar were woken up, dragged from their beds and rushed to the scene. The baby was in extreme distress and the ward was swarming with senior doctors. An emergency Caesarean was performed. There was urgent work to be done helping the baby to breathe, but this time the outcome was a good one. The mother and baby were fine. Dr Carter was not. 'I was completely traumatised by the whole experience. I thought I would have to leave medicine, that I just couldn't take the possible consequences of a mistake. And I realised how easy the mistake had been to make.' It has been estimated that as many as 33,000 people die in Britain every year as a result of medical errors or accidents. Nobody knows how many near misses there are - mistakes, like Dr Carter's, caught in time to prevent serious injury - but doctors themselves admit they are ubiquitous. Until very recently, these numbers were not acknowledged or discussed. Every accident was treated as an anomaly, a shocking and terrible one-off. The truth - that all doctors make mistakes, including the very best ones - is not what patients want to hear, but it was all that kept Dr Carter in medicine. 'I was upset and depressed about it for months, but I gradually came to realise that this was the kind of mistake that happens all the time. It wasn't a one-off caused by an incompetent - me - but the kind of everyday error that is rife throughout the whole medical system.' That knowledge is only just hitting the rest of us. A recent spate of high profile and extraordinary cases has focused the full beam of public and media attention on medical mistakes as never before: the scandal of the paediatric heart surgeons at Bristol Royal Infirmary; the case of the surgeon in west Wales who removed the wrong kidney from his patient, causing the patient's death. Even Harold Shipman, the GP who killed at least 15 of his elderly patients deliberately rather than accidentally, exposed a reality we prefer to deny. According to Dr Ian Bogle, who is chairman of the British Medical Association, 'It's a very rare doctor who will get through his or her career without making serious mistakes. The conditions under which doctors work, and the very nature of medicine, means errors are inevitable.' The nature of medicine means that doctors work under extreme pressure, situations are often urgent, and decisions have to be made in seconds. Under those conditions, what is an error? Removing the wrong kidney is pretty unequivocal, but medicine is an imprecise science. Sometimes we blame error for an unwanted outcome, when the error is an error of judgement, but then only with hindsight. Dr Nick Cheshire, a vascular consultant at St Mary's hospital in Paddington describes the daily judgement calls that may or may not turn out well. 'A patient presents with blocked arteries in his leg and a potential risk of developing gangrene. If we leave the patient as he is there may be a 20 per cent or higher risk to his life over the next year. If we operate, there may be a 5 per cent risk to his life - but that's tomorrow morning; 5 per cent may not sound like a high risk, but if you or a member of your family is one of those 5 per cent, that's 100 per cent as far as you're concerned.' The government and the General Medical Council (GMC) are rushing through new legislation and systems designed to reduce errors and protect patients, which is what we all want. But there is one group of people, profoundly affected by the consequences of medical mistakes, being overlooked in this rush of reform: the doctors who make them. Medical errors are often traumatic or tragic for patients, but they are also devastating for doctors. Depression, breakdown, leaving the profession and even suicide are common responses among doctors to their own mistakes. It's a high price to pay for the risks we ask them to take every day. Of course, we need protection from bad or incompetent doctors. But what about the good doctors, whose split-second mistakes can have equally terrible consequences? There's no helpline for traumatised doctors, no on-site counselling service or 'buddy' system where they can deal with their guilt and shame. When Dr Carter made her mistake, her impulse was to apologise to the patient 'but there just wasn't any procedure for it. I was discouraged from talking about it at all. It was made plain that I'd made a mistake and that I wasn't to make it again, but beyond that it was kind of bad form to want to discuss it. By the next day, I was expected to be over it, and to just get on with it.' It wasn't callousness that made her superiors ignore her distress, but the long-standing tradition of silence about mistakes in medicine, driven by guilt and shame, by fear of the consequences and by the 'hero' culture in which doctors feel they can't admit weaknesses or failings, either to each other or to their patients. In an age of awesome technological sophistication, we can't accept how little we still know about our own biology or the limitations of medicine. The pressure on doctors to live up to impossible patient expectations is immense. Sir Donald Irvine, president of the GMC describes 'the powerful collusion between doctor and patient to perpetrate the myth of infallibility', and Dr Marc de Leval, a leading cardiac surgeon, says: 'The need to perform faultlessly has created a strong pressure for intellectual dishonesty to cover up mistakes, rather than admit them.' In March, the British Medical Journal (BMJ) devoted an entire issue to the subject of medical errors, fingering a deeply entrenched culture of 'blame and punish' as the biggest deterrent to reducing them, producing an atmosphere of fear, shame and secrecy. In one article, the BMJ describes doctors as 'the second victim' of medical error, often paying for a mistake with their mental health, marriages and livelihoods. And it's a unique pressure. There isn't another profession where mistakes are so poorly tolerated or understood, or the price paid for them so high. We may live in a global age, but we're still applying Old Testament standards to doctors. In law, or the media, there's only one response to a doctor who makes a serious mistake: name them, shame them, take them to court and if possible get them struck off. Of course, doctors have to be accountable for their mistakes. But it's a system that helps neither doctor nor patient, and does nothing to make medicine safer. According to the BMJ, 'The easy, understandable and completely wrong answer is to blame those who made the mistake.' Faced with the human suffering of a victim and their family, it may be a natural human impulse to need somebody to blame. But it won't stop the same mistake from happening to somebody else. We can reduce medical error, but it requires a process that doesn't just involve individual doctors and the health service, but a redefining of the whole culture of medicine and the unwritten contract between doctor and patient. Sir Donald Irvine sums up a fundamental change in attitude: 'We've got to move away from picking up mistakes after they happen, to the business of asking why they happen.' According to Matthew Pitt, a consultant at Great Ormond Street Hospital, and part of the hospital's working group on clinical risk, blaming a doctor for errors ignores the fact that many - maybe most - mistakes are the result of a series of system errors that come together with potentially disastrous consequences. 'It's common for doctors to feel that errors are entirely their own fault. Cool reflection will often bring to light a system dysfunction that has placed the doctor at risk on the front line.' System dysfunction can mean anything from a missing set of notes to a pharmaceutical company suddenly changing the colour of the label on a drug. In Dr Carter's case, the system allowed oral and intravenous doses to be easily mixed up. The nurse was only required to check that the dosage was accurate according to the doctor's instructions - there was no check that the instruction was accurate in the first place. She was failed again by her working conditions. According to Pitt, 'The mistake when the junior doctor has been up for 24 hours is an obvious example. The overbooked outpatient clinic or operating list are other scenarios where error is more likely.' Another young doctor describes her own most terrifying near-miss. 'When patients are nil-by-mouth they are often hooked up to a saline drip. It's common to add potassium to about every third bag of solution. I was asked to do that, only instead of adding the potassium to the bag I injected it directly into the patient's vein - 10ml of potassium chloride straight into a vein is a very good way to kill somebody.' The emergency team were called and the patient was saved, but it might easily have been otherwise. It was a standard, low-risk procedure, but the doctor had been administering injections all day, and had been on duty for 15 hours. Reducing mistakes to the nitty-gritty detailed steps that cause them - the 'systems' approach, rather than a 'person- centred' approach is becoming the great white hope of improving medical safety. It isn't an attempt to make excuses for doctors or to release anyone from their personal responsibility. Instead, it acknowledges that all human beings are fallible, and will sooner or later make mistakes, so systems must be designed that prevent these mistakes from having disastrous consequences. If errors are predictable, they become preventable. The person-centred model - which views doctors as 'choosing' between safe and unsafe behaviour - dominates medicine, and has produced the blame and shame culture. Writing in the BMJ, Professor James Reason, the world's leading authority on human error described it as an approach that is only 'likely to thwart the development of safer healthcare'. In a systems approach, he argues, the focus is not on who made the mistake, but how and why the defences designed to prevent it have failed. It's based, he says, 'on the assumption that we cannot change the human condition, but we can change the conditions in which humans work.' Not all mistakes are fatal, but every mistake is potentially dangerous, and the possibility for mistakes - and the fear of their consequences - is present everyday, at every consultation, even the most simple and apparently straightforward. Professor Brian Jarman from the Imperial College Medical School in London was a GP for many years, and describes two stories, representative of hundreds like them, which could have led to him being the subject of a serious complaint. 'I had one patient, a young woman. I found her behaviour to be somewhat seductive and inappropriate - just the alarm bells of experience. She seemed to me to be requesting an unusually high number of vaginal examinations, and I thought it best to discreetly warn the other members of my practice. Unfortunately, the warning didn't reach our most junior member in time, and sure enough, he found himself the subject of a very nasty complaint for sexual misconduct. It was absolutely traumatising for him, but luckily the complaint was thrown out when it was discovered that she had made something like 27 similar complaints over a very short period of time. 'In another case, a lady came to see us to have her ears syringed before going on holiday. The practice nurse did it, although she wasn't really supposed to without permission from a doctor. While on holiday, this lady had her ears syringed again. Later she developed an ear infection, and her union recommended she sued me, as her GP, for causing the infection. Even though I'd never even treated her, I was held responsible.' The patient declined to complain for common-sense reasons, but others don't. Complaints against doctors can take from one to 10 years, and although the complaints procedure was improved in 1996 it remains difficult and unsatisfactory for most patients, and an ordeal for most doctors - whether they are found guilty or not. One GP from the Midlands describes his experience of a recent complaint. 'I had a patient who was a 97-year-old woman. I visited her at home as she was complaining of back pain - it was likely to be caused by one of two things: a collapsed vertebrae or bone cancer. In both cases, there is no instant or obvious treatment. As I was going on holiday the next day, I arranged for a very good locum to visit her within a few days. In that time, the patient developed a cough and a chest infection, which eventually turned into pneumonia. She was admitted to hospital, but she sadly died.' Her husband - 98 years old and bereft - complained that the doctor had failed to spot his wife's chest complaint, and that failure to treat it sooner had led to her death. The family made an official complaint to the Community Health Council, which took 15 months to complete. In that time, the GP carried on working 'although the stress of the complaint affected me terribly. Everybody at the practice knew about the complaint, and although my colleagues were supportive, I felt under a cloud of suspicion. I questioned my own capabilities and judgement, and tormented myself with the thought that I had somehow failed this family although I knew that I'd done all I could do, and I'd only seen the poor woman once. 'When the day of the hearing for the complaint finally arrived I was shaking, and I hadn't slept. The law, and the complaints procedure, is supposed to be neutral. But all through those 15 months I felt that the onus was on me to prove myself. We're very patient-centred, which I support, but it means the doctor feels guilty until proven innocent.' The complaint was not upheld , but the GP, with 25 years of exemplary service to his name, has been so traumatised by the experience that he is now looking for a job outside medicine. According to Dr Gerard Panting, a GP who also works for the Medical Protection Society, one result of the fear of the consequences of a medical mistake has been the rise in 'defensive medicine'. 'Doctors end up not trusting their own judgement. If a patient has a simple headache, they may order a brain scan and a battery of other tests just to protect themselves in case that headache one day turns out to be something more serious. It happens a great deal in America, where fear of legislation is forcing all doctors to work this way, and it's happening here.' Costs spiral, and the patient is subjected to tests they don't need. Until recently, doctors operated their own code of omert\u00e0. Prior to 1995 and the publication of Good Medical Practice, doctors worked to the principle that they should never disparage their colleagues, and should only report another doctor as a last resort, in cases of really serious professional misconduct, if then. But it is changing. As it struggles to develop legal, cultural and moral responses to its technological miracles and to adapt to the speed of those miracles as well as the pace of social change, we're struggling with it. What do we want doctors to be? Equal partners in our healthcare? Or supernaturally gifted healers? The problem for them is that we want both. They may be idolised or demonised, but doctors are no longer undisputed authorities. While we still expect them to perform miracles, patient power - boosted by a more 'consumer' attitude towards medicine - is transforming the culture of the consulting room. At the same time, a whole raft of new guidelines and legislation is being introduced, which means that doctors will be regulated at unprecedented levels. For the first time, doctors can expect to be appraised and reviewed. The GMC's Best Medical Practice is now unequivocal in requiring doctors to report each others adverse behaviour or performance. It says: 'You must protect patients when you believe a doctor's health, conduct or performance is a threat to them. Protecting their own at any price is going the way of Doctor Knows Best.' But there is also a new, if tentative, acknowledgement that the best way to protect patients is to support doctors. At Great Ormond Street, there is a pilot scheme called the Professional Standards Advisory Group, where any health care professional can discuss any aspect of errors or safety in confidence. Near misses can be reported, worries about colleagues can be discussed, and the good doctors who make mistakes can be helped to come to terms with them. Other hospitals are looking at similar schemes, and there is a general, if painfully slow, move towards glasnost across the whole area. Changing the blame culture doesn't mean that doctors won't be held responsible for their actions, or that the effects of their mistakes are not fully or properly acknowledged. Every doctor I spoke to believed that it would lead instead to a more open and accountable health service. The final factor in making medicine safer is a much wider acknowledgement of how intrinsically unsafe and imprecise it is. Diagnoses are constantly being reviewed and adapted, no two patients respond in the same way to the same treatment, diseases don't follow predictable patterns of development or healing. There is no such thing as a risk-free procedure. There will always be a paradox in talking about human error in life or death situations, as Matthew Pitt acknowledges. 'We can reduce error, and we can deal with it better, but we'll never get 100 per cent perfection. At the same time, we can never stop trying.' \u0095 Some names and minor details have been changed",

      "body": "<p>Entering Europe illegally is a dangerous business for asylum seekers and so-called 'economic migrants', whether they come from Iraq, Turkey, Sri Lanka or China. But for the growing numbers of Africans prepared to cross the Sahara in search of a job, the journey is a nightmare.</p> <p>Williams Osunde grew up in Lagos, Nigeria. He was 20 when he abandoned his studies for lack of funds. He set out north with a group of friends. Their goal was Ceuta, the Spanish enclave tucked into Morocco's Mediterranean coastline - a hike of about 2,000 miles. They each paid \u00a350 for a place on a lorry to the border with Niger. More money changed hands at the frontier. For weeks Williams and his friends were stranded, trying to raise enough cash for the next leg of the journey. A six-day march, and a few rides in trucks, brought them within range of Algeria. Here they hired the services of a trafficker, who took their money, put them in a lorry but dumped them well short of the border. They walked the remaining 50 miles.</p> <p>While they waited for an opportune moment to cross, one of their party died of thirst. From then on, Williams lost track of the place names and the stages of the journey. It was over 1,000 miles. They did some of it on foot and as far as he knew - he was delirious for much of the time - it took around two months, with occasional lifts in trucks allowing them to strike an average of 20-25 miles a day. By the time they had crossed the desert and reached Ceuta, four more people had died.</p> <p>I met Williams in a holding camp for illegal sub-Saharan migrants and Algerian asylum-seekers in Ceuta. The territory is one of the European Union's frontline defences against clandestine migration. Since decolonisation in North Africa, Spain has hung on to Ceuta and its twin enclave, Melilla. And so, on Spain's entry into the European Union in 1986, two forward posts of the EU came into existence in Africa. The trickle of people like Williams began in the mid-1990s. In 1997, about 700 'illegals' came up through the Sahara and entered Ceuta from Morocco. By 1998, the figure was nearer 1,000. Last year it was 7,000. A year-on-year increase projected on these figures alone is worrying, to both the Spanish authorities and the EU.</p> <p>Ceuta is one of several vulnerable flanks of Fortress Europe - a tempting point of transgression where migrant pressure has to be opposed. In 1993 the EU approved funding for a defensive wall round the enclave. It has two high parallel wire fences running for five miles round the territory, a roll of razor wire, a line of electronic sensors and 33 closed-circuit cameras. The cost was estimated at $25 million. The game was on: a contest between the low technologies of willpower and mutiny, and the hi-tech security skills of the rich world.</p> <p>Last year, as the figures for illegal migrants to Ceuta rose sharply, the authorities began to beef up the defence with better surveillance and some redesign. But officials in the Governor's Office in Ceuta argue privately it will only thin numbers down or drive migrants to take the more dangerous option of fishing boats from the coast of Africa to mainland Spain via the Straits of Gibraltar. One official in the Governor's Office is working on the assumption that, by 2015, between 15 and 20 million migrants will have made a bid for Western Europe via Spanish territory.</p> <p>No one knows how many 'irregular' migrants are in the EU. Since the early 1990s, tens of thousands have entered from the remains of the Eastern Bloc. And the manner of their entry, aided and often abused by traffickers, means many remain caught in a world of illegality or exploitation.</p> <p>By the middle of the decade, the Dutch police estimated 75 per cent of Amsterdam's prostitutes were non-nationals. Of these, they believed, 80 per cent were in the country illegally. According to a recent study in the Netherlands, a Dutch prostitute earning $300 a day would see between half and two-thirds of those earnings. But a newcomer from Ukraine, who could earn $500 in a day, could expect $25 in hand at the end of it. Traffickers and crime rings pocket the difference. In 1997 a court in Brussels convicted nine members of a Nigerian prostitution ring. The women recruited in West Africa had been promised asylum to entice them to Europe. They could buy their freedom for $25,000.</p> <p>But what is the bigger issue here - the presence of illegal migrants or the crimes of indenture and ransom, and insatiable demand in the marketplace? These are not the fault of the illegal migrant herself. Like most people at a disadvantage, she can only collude. Dealing with clandestine migration is high on the EU's agenda. When Austria held the EU presidency two years ago, it suggested in a draft paper on asylum and migration that 1.5 million migrants entered the wealthy European states every year and that 'every other migrant in the \"first world\" is there illegally'. There is no knowing the truth of this assertion, but one thing is sure: the muddier the conjecture, the better it sticks, and the association with illegality is hard for large numbers of non-nationals in EU countries to shed.</p> <p>Last week in Romsey, Tory leader William Hague hammered it home shamelessly in the closing stages of the by-election campaign, accusing the Government of being soft on crime and soft on asylum seekers. But it is not surprising asylum seekers take clandestine routes to safety in the West. Britain and other EU members have put a host of exclusionary measures in place, including draconian visa regimes and the penalisation of airlines carrying refugee passengers, to keep them at bay.</p> <p>For many, illegal entry with the help of traffickers is the only option. Indeed, the traffickers are their lifeline. The Chinese gangs known as snakeheads, who induct women into a life of semi-slavery in the US and Britain, were also the people who ran dissidents to safety in the retreat from Tiananmen Square. Refugees have always kept strange company in seeking sanctuary. Nowadays, they share their routes to safety with disadvantaged 'economic migrants' to whom national borders are simply barriers to prosperity - people like Williams Osunde, who will walk many hundreds of miles for a job.</p> <p>For most of this year in Britain, asylum seekers have been the object of a tough-talk competition between the parties. But as the last political capital is wrung from their misfortunes, a bigger question is coming into focus: how is it possible to restrict freedom of human movement across borders in a world where the falling price of airline fares and the spread of digital communications encourage the taste for access?</p> <p>And is it right to restrict it? There are few constraints now on the movement of capital and goods. Yet often the very people who think it a sin to tamper with the self-expression of the markets are the first to call for lower immigration from poorer countries, even though it would take decades of inward immigration to bring about the kind of social change a brisk downsizing or a liquidation by a large corporation like BMW can inject into a social landscape in a year.</p> <p>Illegal migrants in Western Europe are a tiny minority of the 200 million people worldwide now residing outside their country of origin. They and their legal counterparts account for nothing like the number of immigrants that wealthy countries such as Britain will require in future. 'Very high volumes of migration would be needed,' the OECD reported in 1998, 'to change the trend in ageing populations' in prosperous countries.</p> <p>The analogy might be a basin of water with the plug out and the tap running. The first gurgling sounds are audible from 2010 onwards, when the ratio of citizens between 15 and 64 to citizens over 65 is no longer sustainable. The shortfall in the first group is so large that, by 2020, according to the OECD, tens of millions of people will be required to restore the ratio in Australia, the US and Britain.</p> <p>Whether the rich world is deeply confused or simply too single-minded for its own good depends on how you see it. Williams Osunde was in no doubt. While he was in Ceuta waiting to be processed out of the detention camp for illegals as a casual labourer in mainland Spain, a young woman from West Africa was caught on the perimeter. She was in the eighth month of her pregnancy. She committed suicide in a cell before she could be transferred to the camp.</p> <p>Though Williams had never met her, he insisted on attending the funeral. At the graveside, he read from Ephesians: 'For we wrestle not against the flesh and blood but against principalities - against spiritual wickedness in high places.' The way Williams saw it, there were two domains, that of the rich and that of the poor. And there was a conspiracy to ensure that those from the second who needed to reach the first were kept from doing so.</p> <p>\u00a9 Jeremy Harding, reproduced from 'The Uninvited: Refugees at the Rich Man's Gate', published by Profile Books Ltd with the 'London Review of Books' at \u00a35.99 on 11 May</p>",

In 1993 the EU approved funding for a defensive wall round the enclave. It has two high parallel wire fences running for five miles round the territory, a roll of razor wire, a line of electronic sensors and 33 closed-circuit cameras. The cost was estimated at $25 million. The game was on: a contest between the low technologies of willpower and mutiny, and the hi-tech security skills of the rich world. Last year, as the figures for illegal migrants to Ceuta rose sharply, the authorities began to beef up the defence with better surveillance and some redesign. But officials in the Governor's Office in Ceuta argue privately it will only thin numbers down or drive migrants to take the more dangerous option of fishing boats from the coast of Africa to mainland Spain via the Straits of Gibraltar. One official in the Governor's Office is working on the assumption that, by 2015, between 15 and 20 million migrants will have made a bid for Western Europe via Spanish territory. No one knows how many 'irregular' migrants are in the EU. Since the early 1990s, tens of thousands have entered from the remains of the Eastern Bloc. And the manner of their entry, aided and often abused by traffickers, means many remain caught in a world of illegality or exploitation. By the middle of the decade, the Dutch police estimated 75 per cent of Amsterdam's prostitutes were non-nationals. Of these, they believed, 80 per cent were in the country illegally. According to a recent study in the Netherlands, a Dutch prostitute earning $300 a day would see between half and two-thirds of those earnings. But a newcomer from Ukraine, who could earn $500 in a day, could expect $25 in hand at the end of it. Traffickers and crime rings pocket the difference. In 1997 a court in Brussels convicted nine members of a Nigerian prostitution ring. The women recruited in West Africa had been promised asylum to entice them to Europe. They could buy their freedom for $25,000. But what is the bigger issue here - the presence of illegal migrants or the crimes of indenture and ransom, and insatiable demand in the marketplace? These are not the fault of the illegal migrant herself. Like most people at a disadvantage, she can only collude. Dealing with clandestine migration is high on the EU's agenda. When Austria held the EU presidency two years ago, it suggested in a draft paper on asylum and migration that 1.5 million migrants entered the wealthy European states every year and that 'every other migrant in the \"first world\" is there illegally'. There is no knowing the truth of this assertion, but one thing is sure: the muddier the conjecture, the better it sticks, and the association with illegality is hard for large numbers of non-nationals in EU countries to shed. Last week in Romsey, Tory leader William Hague hammered it home shamelessly in the closing stages of the by-election campaign, accusing the Government of being soft on crime and soft on asylum seekers. But it is not surprising asylum seekers take clandestine routes to safety in the West. Britain and other EU members have put a host of exclusionary measures in place, including draconian visa regimes and the penalisation of airlines carrying refugee passengers, to keep them at bay. For many, illegal entry with the help of traffickers is the only option. Indeed, the traffickers are their lifeline. The Chinese gangs known as snakeheads, who induct women into a life of semi-slavery in the US and Britain, were also the people who ran dissidents to safety in the retreat from Tiananmen Square. Refugees have always kept strange company in seeking sanctuary. Nowadays, they share their routes to safety with disadvantaged 'economic migrants' to whom national borders are simply barriers to prosperity - people like Williams Osunde, who will walk many hundreds of miles for a job. For most of this year in Britain, asylum seekers have been the object of a tough-talk competition between the parties. But as the last political capital is wrung from their misfortunes, a bigger question is coming into focus: how is it possible to restrict freedom of human movement across borders in a world where the falling price of airline fares and the spread of digital communications encourage the taste for access? And is it right to restrict it? There are few constraints now on the movement of capital and goods. Yet often the very people who think it a sin to tamper with the self-expression of the markets are the first to call for lower immigration from poorer countries, even though it would take decades of inward immigration to bring about the kind of social change a brisk downsizing or a liquidation by a large corporation like BMW can inject into a social landscape in a year. Illegal migrants in Western Europe are a tiny minority of the 200 million people worldwide now residing outside their country of origin. They and their legal counterparts account for nothing like the number of immigrants that wealthy countries such as Britain will require in future. 'Very high volumes of migration would be needed,' the OECD reported in 1998, 'to change the trend in ageing populations' in prosperous countries. The analogy might be a basin of water with the plug out and the tap running. The first gurgling sounds are audible from 2010 onwards, when the ratio of citizens between 15 and 64 to citizens over 65 is no longer sustainable. The shortfall in the first group is so large that, by 2020, according to the OECD, tens of millions of people will be required to restore the ratio in Australia, the US and Britain. Whether the rich world is deeply confused or simply too single-minded for its own good depends on how you see it. Williams Osunde was in no doubt. While he was in Ceuta waiting to be processed out of the detention camp for illegals as a casual labourer in mainland Spain, a young woman from West Africa was caught on the perimeter. She was in the eighth month of her pregnancy. She committed suicide in a cell before she could be transferred to the camp. Though Williams had never met her, he insisted on attending the funeral. At the graveside, he read from Ephesians: 'For we wrestle not against the flesh and blood but against principalities - against spiritual wickedness in high places.' The way Williams saw it, there were two domains, that of the rich and that of the poor. And there was a conspiracy to ensure that those from the second who needed to reach the first were kept from doing so. \u00a9 Jeremy Harding, reproduced from 'The Uninvited: Refugees at the Rich Man's Gate', published by Profile Books Ltd with the 'London Review of Books' at \u00a35.99 on 11 May",
