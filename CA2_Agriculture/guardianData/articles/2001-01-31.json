      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I take back all my griping about New Zealand's weather. The last few days have been almost perfect. Clear blue skies and warm reviving sunshine. I have made the most of the weather and so this is a bit of a long report. It's worth hanging in there for the dolphins though.</p> <p>My week started with a very pleasant couple of days in the lakeside town of Wanaka. It's a small place but with a good selection of bars and cafes and it's in a beautiful setting, nestled among the mountains of the Southern alps. There are a number of good walks you can do along the lakeshore or in the surrounding hills. I had been planning to climb Mount Roy. But while strolling around the western shore I stumbled across the tiny Rippon Vineyards where you could do wine tasting for NZ$3 (about \u00a31).</p> <p>After a few glasses of the local riesling, a little sleep in the sun among the vines seemed a much more relaxing option than climbing mountains.</p> <p>That evening I treated myself to a trip to the pictures. The movie was a laughably bad Dennis Quaid vehicle called Frequency. But the film didn't really matter because Wanaka cinema was such a delight. About the size of a village hall, the seating was a motley assortment of armchairs and sofas with a convertible Morris Minor thrown in for good measure.</p> <p>Halfway through, the film stopped and we had a short interval. Everyone went outside to the adjoining cafe and got freshly baked cookies (still warm), homemade ice cream or a beer and then settled back into their armchairs. This is how all cinemas should be. It was more like being round someone's house.</p> <p>I reluctantly left Lake Wanaka and travelled on to Queenstown. On the way we stopped at Kawarau Suspension Bridge. This is the home of the original and most famous bungy jump venue in the country, with a 43m drop to the fast-flowing river below.</p> <p>Before arriving in New Zealand I had no intention of doing a bungee jump but the combined onslaught of hard-sell promotion, peer pressure and a feeling that I didn't want to be left out, had weakened me. So 10 minutes after I had signed up and parted with NZ$125, I was sitting on the bridge having elastic cord tied round my ankles.</p> <p>I declined the offer of being dunked headfirst in the water and then gingerly hopped on to the platform over the river.</p> <p>It was a long way down.</p> <p>You are supposed to perform an elegant swan dive but standing there on the edge I lost my nerve and basically fell off. I had a brief sensation of hanging in the air. I felt like I was in one of those cartoons where the animated character has run off the cliff and his legs are whirring over nothing. Then I was plummeting down towards the river. Then I was bouncing back up to the bridge. Then I was falling back down again.</p> <p>This went on for some time.</p> <p>I was doing a little upside down pirouette when I heard a voice calling \"Grab the pole\". There was a dinghy below me with a couple of guys in it, one of whom was holding a pole. I eventually got hold of it, and he hauled me into the boat. In no time I was back at the top of the gorge, being cheered by my fellow travellers.</p> <p>You can see the video of my performance on the website. This was beautifully shot by Katy Bradbury who is not only an excellent camerawoman but also coped admirably when we thought the camera hadn't worked and she had missed the whole thing. It was just as well it did work because I won't be doing it again.</p> <p>Queenstown was another lakeside alpine city in a stunning setting with just about every conceivable activity on offer from white water rafting to skydiving. It's also the party capital of New Zealand and that evening I went out to test some of the bars.</p> <p>I bumped into Steve who I'd last seen on the Franz Josef Glacier. This is the great thing about travelling on an organised tour like the Magic Bus - it's really easy to meet people. You are all travelling in the same direction and going to roughly the same places, so there's a good chance that when you get on the bus in the morning there will always be somebody you know there.</p> <p>Steve had just done the Nevis Highwire Bungy - a huge 134m fall from a glass bottomed cabin strung across a river - so we headed off to have a number of pints of Speights (the local brewery) to celebrate our survival.</p> <p>Early next morning, nursing a delicate hangover, I headed on to Fiordland and Lake Te Anau.</p> <p>Fiordland National Park sits at the bottom of New Zealand's west coast. There are a number of world famous hiking routes here (tramps as the Kiwis call them) including the popular Milford Track, access to which is booked up months in advance. I can see why, the scenery is breathtaking with high mountain lakes, deep empty fiords and a rugged rain-swept coastline.</p> <p>I had enjoyed my earlier one-day sea kayaking excursion in Abel Tasman so much that I had decided to do a more adventurous trip, and secured the last available place on a two-day guided tour into Doubtful Sound run by Fiordland Wilderness Experiences. This company, run by Daphne Taylor and Bill Gibson, is one of the few to do kayaking trips into Doubtful Sound, which is considerably less accessible than the better known Milford Sound some 100km further up the coast.</p> <p>I met up with Daphne and the rest of my group at their base in Te Anau. Daphne briefed us on the details of the tour and what we needed to bring (this was mainly food as pretty much everything else is provided). She promised what sounded like a fantastic wilderness trip. We would spend two days exploring the quiet reaches of the Sound and spend the night in a small bush camp. Jeremy our guide would pick us all up from our hostels at 6am tomorrow.</p> <p>I stocked up with provisions at the local supermarket. I wasn't going to have to carry it for miles on my back this time, so I got a few luxuries including a date and walnut cake and fresh pasta. I also bought plenty of bug repellent - the sandflies are legendary round here and Daphne had warned us about them.</p> <p>Next morning, Jeremy drove us across to Lake Manapouri. A motorboat took us 30km across the rolling lake - it was really cold and there was snow on the peaks - this was supposed to be summer!</p> <p>We landed in an empty bay next to a hydoelectric power station. After packing all our gear into a huge four-wheel drive landcruiser we set off on the 24km steep drive over Wilmot Pass and down to Deep Cove at the end of Doubtful Sound (see what I mean about it being inaccessible?).</p> <p>We carried the kayaks down to the waterside and loaded them up. Jeremy handed out all our equipment: wetsuits, thermal tops, waterproof jacket, life jacket, suncap, camera bag, etc. He then ran through the various safety measures and emphasised that we really were out in the wilderness here and would need to work as a team and rely on each other if anything went wrong.</p> <p>And then we were out on the calm waters, paddling. It was beautiful. Snow-capped mountains rose up all around us. Waterfalls cascaded down the towering sea cliffs. Seals played with each other or sunbathed on rocky outcrops. There was no-one about but us, not a fishing boat, a plane or even any other kayaks.</p> <p>I was in a double kayak with Thabea from Germany. She was happy for me to sit in the back and do all the steering. This was a mistake as it took me a while to get used to the rudder controls and our early path was a bit erratic. However I managed to avoid crashing into the others and soon we were enthusiastically paddling along the shore at a good pace (too enthusiastic actually as Jeremy had to keep calling us back when we got too far away from the rest of the group).</p> <p>We spent a lovely day exploring Hall Arm off the main reach of the Sound. Jeremy stopped to show us local wildlife and geology. We paddled under glittering waterfalls. The water was completely pure and you could hold out your hand to catch and drink it as it fell.</p> <p>We stopped for lunch in a little rocky cove and then headed up the shallow river mouth of the Arm. In late afternoon we landed at the campsite and hauled the kayaks up well clear of the tide.</p> <p>The campsite was right in the bush with spaces for the tents and a larger space for an insect shelter where we could do cooking and relax in the evening. I set my tent up next to a little rushing stream.</p> <p>We had a few drinks down by the shore as the sun began to set. But the sandflies were out in force, and after a while we had to retreat to the shelter. Jeremy pulled out a cask of wine to help the evening along and we spent the evening eating, drinking, telling jokes and listening to the birds calling around us.</p> <p>We got up early the next day and were in the middle of breakfast when Jeremy popped his head into the shelter and asked we wanted to see something special. We followed him down to the shore. It was a beautiful morning. The water was completely still and the mountains were reflected in its surface. A few hundred metres off near the other shore, a small pod of bottlenose dolphins was working its way up the Arm. You could see their explosive breath like little steam engines blowing out of the water as they slowly rose and dipped.</p> <p>We rushed back to the camp and packed up the tents so we could get out on the water. We did this as quickly as possible but it was still a slow process and by the time we were struggling to carry the heavy kayaks out, the dolphins had turned back and were now a long way off at the entrance to the Arm. We had missed a rare opportunity to paddle with these amazing creatures. We were all terribly disappointed, but Jeremy pointed out that we were really lucky to have even seen them at all.</p> <p>Thabea and I were out on the water first and Jeremy was just explaining that we might still catch them up when Thabea interrupted him pointing ahead of us, \"Look!\". There was another pod of about seven dolphins coming straight towards us. </p> <p>We quickly paddled out. Jeremy cautioned us not to approach the group but let them come to us if they wanted. As they got closer to us the pod dived. For a moment everything was still. Then Jeremy cried out \"One's just gone right under me\". And the next moment the dolphins were playing all around us. They jumped over each other. They raced us. They dived under the kayaks. They swam alongside us. Two leapt out of the water either side of me.</p> <p>It must have only lasted a few short minutes but what an incredible emotional experience. I will never forget it.</p> <p>The dolphins could easily outpace us and they soon moved on up the Arm leaving us slow coaches behind. We saw another similar sized group soon afterwards, but they dived under us and kept moving. They were probably chasing a shoal of fish and didn't have time to stop and play. </p> <p>The rest of the morning slipped by on the tranquil waters as we slowly moved back out into the main reach of the Sound. We stopped for lunch on a little beach. While we were brewing coffee the wind picked up. It was still clear and sunny but the wind was now rushing down the Sound. Before we got back into the kayaks, Jeremy briefed us on how to tackle the next stretch. We needed to get across the Sound to the far side of Elizabeth Island but the strengthening breeze would make this a lot tougher than the easy cruising we had been doing so far, and we would need to angle ourselves into the wind and paddle hard.</p> <p>Off we went, and almost straight away I was drenched by a big wave. Shaking the water out of my eyes, I dug my paddle in and our now rather small and vulnerable kayak pushed out into the middle of the reach. It was pretty rocky for a while - that wasn't the only wave to soak me, but it was more exciting than dangerous. Jeremy was darting from one kayak to another making sure we were ok and keeping the group together.</p> <p>By the time we made it to the shelter of the island we were all out of breath. So we formed the kayaks into a raft, rigged up a sail and coasted back down the reach with the wind at our backs.</p> <p>There was a little time for some surfing too before we were back at Deep Cove and unpacking the kayaks.</p> <p>It was a fantastic couple of days, and I would recommend it to anyone.

      "bodyText": "I take back all my griping about New Zealand's weather. The last few days have been almost perfect. Clear blue skies and warm reviving sunshine. I have made the most of the weather and so this is a bit of a long report. It's worth hanging in there for the dolphins though. My week started with a very pleasant couple of days in the lakeside town of Wanaka. It's a small place but with a good selection of bars and cafes and it's in a beautiful setting, nestled among the mountains of the Southern alps. There are a number of good walks you can do along the lakeshore or in the surrounding hills. I had been planning to climb Mount Roy. But while strolling around the western shore I stumbled across the tiny Rippon Vineyards where you could do wine tasting for NZ$3 (about \u00a31). After a few glasses of the local riesling, a little sleep in the sun among the vines seemed a much more relaxing option than climbing mountains. That evening I treated myself to a trip to the pictures. The movie was a laughably bad Dennis Quaid vehicle called Frequency. But the film didn't really matter because Wanaka cinema was such a delight. About the size of a village hall, the seating was a motley assortment of armchairs and sofas with a convertible Morris Minor thrown in for good measure. Halfway through, the film stopped and we had a short interval. Everyone went outside to the adjoining cafe and got freshly baked cookies (still warm), homemade ice cream or a beer and then settled back into their armchairs. This is how all cinemas should be. It was more like being round someone's house. I reluctantly left Lake Wanaka and travelled on to Queenstown. On the way we stopped at Kawarau Suspension Bridge. This is the home of the original and most famous bungy jump venue in the country, with a 43m drop to the fast-flowing river below. Before arriving in New Zealand I had no intention of doing a bungee jump but the combined onslaught of hard-sell promotion, peer pressure and a feeling that I didn't want to be left out, had weakened me. So 10 minutes after I had signed up and parted with NZ$125, I was sitting on the bridge having elastic cord tied round my ankles. I declined the offer of being dunked headfirst in the water and then gingerly hopped on to the platform over the river. It was a long way down. You are supposed to perform an elegant swan dive but standing there on the edge I lost my nerve and basically fell off. I had a brief sensation of hanging in the air. I felt like I was in one of those cartoons where the animated character has run off the cliff and his legs are whirring over nothing. Then I was plummeting down towards the river. Then I was bouncing back up to the bridge. Then I was falling back down again. This went on for some time. I was doing a little upside down pirouette when I heard a voice calling \"Grab the pole\". There was a dinghy below me with a couple of guys in it, one of whom was holding a pole. I eventually got hold of it, and he hauled me into the boat. In no time I was back at the top of the gorge, being cheered by my fellow travellers. You can see the video of my performance on the website. This was beautifully shot by Katy Bradbury who is not only an excellent camerawoman but also coped admirably when we thought the camera hadn't worked and she had missed the whole thing. It was just as well it did work because I won't be doing it again. Queenstown was another lakeside alpine city in a stunning setting with just about every conceivable activity on offer from white water rafting to skydiving. It's also the party capital of New Zealand and that evening I went out to test some of the bars. I bumped into Steve who I'd last seen on the Franz Josef Glacier. This is the great thing about travelling on an organised tour like the Magic Bus - it's really easy to meet people. You are all travelling in the same direction and going to roughly the same places, so there's a good chance that when you get on the bus in the morning there will always be somebody you know there. Steve had just done the Nevis Highwire Bungy - a huge 134m fall from a glass bottomed cabin strung across a river - so we headed off to have a number of pints of Speights (the local brewery) to celebrate our survival. Early next morning, nursing a delicate hangover, I headed on to Fiordland and Lake Te Anau. Fiordland National Park sits at the bottom of New Zealand's west coast. There are a number of world famous hiking routes here (tramps as the Kiwis call them) including the popular Milford Track, access to which is booked up months in advance. I can see why, the scenery is breathtaking with high mountain lakes, deep empty fiords and a rugged rain-swept coastline. I had enjoyed my earlier one-day sea kayaking excursion in Abel Tasman so much that I had decided to do a more adventurous trip, and secured the last available place on a two-day guided tour into Doubtful Sound run by Fiordland Wilderness Experiences. This company, run by Daphne Taylor and Bill Gibson, is one of the few to do kayaking trips into Doubtful Sound, which is considerably less accessible than the better known Milford Sound some 100km further up the coast. I met up with Daphne and the rest of my group at their base in Te Anau. Daphne briefed us on the details of the tour and what we needed to bring (this was mainly food as pretty much everything else is provided). She promised what sounded like a fantastic wilderness trip. We would spend two days exploring the quiet reaches of the Sound and spend the night in a small bush camp. Jeremy our guide would pick us all up from our hostels at 6am tomorrow. I stocked up with provisions at the local supermarket. I wasn't going to have to carry it for miles on my back this time, so I got a few luxuries including a date and walnut cake and fresh pasta. I also bought plenty of bug repellent - the sandflies are legendary round here and Daphne had warned us about them. Next morning, Jeremy drove us across to Lake Manapouri. A motorboat took us 30km across the rolling lake - it was really cold and there was snow on the peaks - this was supposed to be summer! We landed in an empty bay next to a hydoelectric power station. After packing all our gear into a huge four-wheel drive landcruiser we set off on the 24km steep drive over Wilmot Pass and down to Deep Cove at the end of Doubtful Sound (see what I mean about it being inaccessible?). We carried the kayaks down to the waterside and loaded them up. Jeremy handed out all our equipment: wetsuits, thermal tops, waterproof jacket, life jacket, suncap, camera bag, etc. He then ran through the various safety measures and emphasised that we really were out in the wilderness here and would need to work as a team and rely on each other if anything went wrong. And then we were out on the calm waters, paddling. It was beautiful. Snow-capped mountains rose up all around us. Waterfalls cascaded down the towering sea cliffs. Seals played with each other or sunbathed on rocky outcrops. There was no-one about but us, not a fishing boat, a plane or even any other kayaks. I was in a double kayak with Thabea from Germany. She was happy for me to sit in the back and do all the steering. This was a mistake as it took me a while to get used to the rudder controls and our early path was a bit erratic. However I managed to avoid crashing into the others and soon we were enthusiastically paddling along the shore at a good pace (too enthusiastic actually as Jeremy had to keep calling us back when we got too far away from the rest of the group).

No chance,\" said Mr Lees, dashing understandable hopes that a 33-year-old sales administrator with a can-making firm might be wavering, especially one who drives a petrol hungry Mazda MX5. \"I'm probably old before my time, having pebbledash, but I'll definitely stay with Labour while Hague's in charge.\"</p> <p>The red roses twining up another bit of thirties d\u00e9cor on Mr Lees's bungalow, the stained glass window panels, might be a warning to canvassers. But his real reason is that sleaze memories - \"You just can't trust the Conservatives,\" he says - are not yet four years old.</p> <p>Across the road, Colin Woodhead's recall goes back a lot further. \"I was on short time working at the foundry under Thatcher,\" he says. \"I don't somehow think they're going to win me back.\"</p> <p>Mr Woodhead and his wife Maria have more pebbledash than anyone else in the avenue, and with teenage children and worries about health, crime and getting speed bumps to put off rat-runners, they fit the leaked central office picture. Aged 43 and 40, concerned about the euro and standards in education, they sound like the prime (35-50, married with kids at state school, generally a bit uneasy) Pebbledashers in the Tory blueprint.</p> <p>But no. Mrs Woodhead says: \"It's taking time to get things right, but then it does. There's a shortage of doctors, but you don't train a doctor in two or three years. We expected change when we voted for Blair, but we know it'll take a good few years for everything to work out.\"</p> <p>Gordon Soothill was the avenue's one possible crumb of comfort, although Shipley Conservatives will have to act quickly to make sure he isn't on holiday when the poll comes. \"It's quite likely,\" he says, admitting to being open to persuasion but only if any one of the three parties tries especially hard.</p> <p>And even this is not over-encouraging for Mr Hague. Mr Soothill is a retired textile company manager, a type whose support for past Conservative leaders was seldom soft. \"Maybe ready for a change,\" is as far as he'll go at the moment; while across the road Mr Stockdale is still rumbling at the pebbledash tag.</p> <p>\"Maybe they meant people with that other stuff you can have on your houses, that looks like crazy paving,\" he said. \"It's as bad as the council people who said we'd have to wait for speed bumps till they'd got them in central Bradford, because out here we're supposed to be 'high class'.\"</p>",

No chance,\" said Mr Lees, dashing understandable hopes that a 33-year-old sales administrator with a can-making firm might be wavering, especially one who drives a petrol hungry Mazda MX5. \"I'm probably old before my time, having pebbledash, but I'll definitely stay with Labour while Hague's in charge.\" The red roses twining up another bit of thirties d\u00e9cor on Mr Lees's bungalow, the stained glass window panels, might be a warning to canvassers. But his real reason is that sleaze memories - \"You just can't trust the Conservatives,\" he says - are not yet four years old. Across the road, Colin Woodhead's recall goes back a lot further. \"I was on short time working at the foundry under Thatcher,\" he says. \"I don't somehow think they're going to win me back.\" Mr Woodhead and his wife Maria have more pebbledash than anyone else in the avenue, and with teenage children and worries about health, crime and getting speed bumps to put off rat-runners, they fit the leaked central office picture. Aged 43 and 40, concerned about the euro and standards in education, they sound like the prime (35-50, married with kids at state school, generally a bit uneasy) Pebbledashers in the Tory blueprint. But no. Mrs Woodhead says: \"It's taking time to get things right, but then it does. There's a shortage of doctors, but you don't train a doctor in two or three years. We expected change when we voted for Blair, but we know it'll take a good few years for everything to work out.\" Gordon Soothill was the avenue's one possible crumb of comfort, although Shipley Conservatives will have to act quickly to make sure he isn't on holiday when the poll comes. \"It's quite likely,\" he says, admitting to being open to persuasion but only if any one of the three parties tries especially hard. And even this is not over-encouraging for Mr Hague. Mr Soothill is a retired textile company manager, a type whose support for past Conservative leaders was seldom soft. \"Maybe ready for a change,\" is as far as he'll go at the moment; while across the road Mr Stockdale is still rumbling at the pebbledash tag. \"Maybe they meant people with that other stuff you can have on your houses, that looks like crazy paving,\" he said. \"It's as bad as the council people who said we'd have to wait for speed bumps till they'd got them in central Bradford, because out here we're supposed to be 'high class'.\"",

A leftwing victory would represent a crushing setback for President Jacques Chirac's corruption-tainted RPR party. It has run Paris ever since 1977, which was when the French government decided that the perennially unruly Parisians could once more be trusted to elect an executive city council and mayor. But it would also mark a wider revolution in French politics: the man who would take over the helm at Paris's palatial and ornate city hall - a mild-mannered but passionate local politician called Bertrand Delano\u00eb - would become the first openly gay man to occupy a high-profile political position in France. Two separate opinion polls this week showed the right's chances fading in more than half the capital's 20 arrondissements, prompting speculation even in the staid Le Monde that the socialists could no longer lose what is by far the most powerful and prominent post up for grabs in the nationwide local elections. A socialist victory in Paris would also give a monumental boost to the hopes of Lionel Jospin, the socialist prime minister, in his widely expected challenge to Mr Chirac for the French presidency in 2002.

      "bodyText": "Middle-ranking university research departments should retain funding after the next Research Assessment Exercise, the vast majority of academics believe. Nearly nine out of ten responses to a consultation on future research policies for English universities argued that grants should be allocated to departments judged to have some projects of national standing. The results of the consultation by the Higher Education Funding Council for England was presented by chief executive Sir Brian Fender yesterday during the council's annual conference, held at the University of Manchester Institute of Science &amp; Technology. Only 57% of respondents agree with the council's plans to prioritise funds for the highest rated departments in the 2001 assessment. Submissions to the latest assessment are due in by the end of March. But the funding council does not decide final ratings and grants for departments until the end of the exercise. The problem the council faces is that it does not have the resources to support every university research group. There was, however, near universal support for the RAE from academics responding to the consultation. The assessment, which produces research ratings for departments every four to five years, has been criticised for dominating academic life to such an extent that teaching activities are marginalised. Sir Brian, who steps down as head of the council in September, told university heads about the council's latest activities, including research and teaching support, efforts to widen access onto university degree courses, the development of the e-university, and a drive to improve equal opportunities among academic staff. The council is considering whether it needs to rationalise the six separate funding schemes for widening participation currently in operation. The academic sector needed to develop closer links with the business world, urged Sir Brian.. Another concern he raised was the lack of university research into higher education, one of the proposed topics of the council's \u00a312m pedagogic research programme, being coordinated by the Economic and Social Research Council. \"We have not seen strong programmes for research into post-16 education. This is not just a concern for university education departments.\"",

The Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld complaints against John Lennon documentary Shine On, Buffy spin-off Angel and cult cartoon South Park after 10 viewers lodged protests. The BSC said the Shine On documentary, shown on September 30 last year, used swearing that \"exceeded acceptable boundaries for broadcast\". It ignored Channel 4's protests that the language was used in a \"non-aggressive manner\". It also ruled that an episode of Angel shown on September 29 - which showed the lead character being stabbed with hot skewers - broke pre-watershed boundaries. The BSC also rapped Channel 4's knuckles for failing to edit out references to paedophilia in the programme, which was broadcast at 6pm. However, the most predictable judgment concerned the non-PC cartoon series South Park. The BSC said an episode shown on August 11 contained detailed descriptions of necrophilia that went beyond acceptable boundaries for the 9.30pm slot.

      "bodyText": "BBC Online, the public service internet operation of the BBC, should either be scrapped or be transformed into a entirely advertising-funded service, a leading Labour MP said today. Gerald Kaufman, chairman of the influential culture select committee, said the BBC should no longer be permitted to use licence payers' money on something that is provided by the commercial sector. The BBC's \"third\" division after TV and radio has been running since 1997 and has consumed more than \u00a3100m of licence-payers money. BBC Online is widely regarded as one of the best in the world, but Mr Kaufman said he believed the BBC should stick to educational and programme-support services. The rest, he said, should be hived off into BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the corporation. \"I see no reason why the BBC can't have online services although it competes on extremely unfair basis with commercial organisations,\" said Mr Kaufman. \"And that's why we recommend that online be hived off into worldwide and not funded by the licence fee. \"It's never been clear what the licence fee funds anyway,\" he added. At today's hearing on the communications white paper, the British Internet Publishers' Alliance said moving BBC Online into Worldwide would be \"disastrous\". BIPA spokesman Hugo Drayton said it would distort the marketplace. He said the BBC Online should cease its commercial activities. BIPA put forward a number of proposals it thought had been overlooked in the white paper. It wants the BBC's new service plans be put under the control of Ofcom, which would scrutinise the commercial impact of the BBC's internet activities. BIPA chairman Rob Hersov voiced his disquiet over the BBC's continuing internet expansion. He said its search for commercial revenues to fund them was crowding out the competition and stifling diversity for consumers. \"BBC Online needs to be scrutinised with a regulatory framework put in place as soon as possible to comment on and steer new BBC internet ventures,\" said Mr Hersov. He cited BBCNews.com and another planned BBC commercial venture - a classical music website - as reasons to rein in the BBC. Derek Wyatt, Labour MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey, agreed said BBC Online was overstepping its public service remit. \"It might be better all round to just say no to Online for the BBC and put it out of the market altogether,\" he said.

Mr Noble reported directly to Disney Channel managing director Paul Robinson, who joined the company at same time. Mr Robinson had previously worked at Talk Radio. The spokeswoman added that Mr Robinson would oversee marketing until a successor was found.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Sharon Corzon, 26</strong> <br><strong>Sentence: five years</strong> <br><strong>Crime: GBH </strong> </p> <p> This was my first sentence and I got the maximum you could get for GBH because I'm black and the girl I attacked was white. That's what I think. The three prisons I've been in have all been prejudiced against black people. </p> <p>White girls can be so rude to the officers - they can swear at them, they can be really insulting and give the officer no respect, and they can get away with it. But if you just say \"no\" and you're black, you're in trouble. </p> <p>As a black person you have to hold back. You have to pretend. You have to creep. You have to keep quiet. You have to be so humble and stupid to survive as a black person in prison, and that's just not me. That's not my personality. I wasn't going to pretend to be something I wasn't. </p> <p>It's the officers rather than the inmates who are racist. Black officers are few and far between. In Holloway there are more because it's in London, but the sad thing is that because they're in the minority they don't speak out against the racism. In fact, I've found they are more prejudiced against the black people. </p> <p>Racism is institutionalised. Who can you complain to? You can't complain to the officer that's being horrible to someone. She'll just make your life hell. You can't complain to the governor because it's his job to back up the officer. You can't complain to the board because it's their job to back up the governor. You're fucked. </p> <p>I took my prison to court because they were trying to take my baby away from me. After about five months being pregnant in the mother and baby unit, I was told I wasn't allowed to keep my baby because they thought I would endanger other mothers because of my temper. It was insulting and they were proved wrong because I won my court case and was allowed to keep my baby. I was sure that was racist as well because the board saw three pregnant black girls in the same week as me and they all got refused permission to keep their babies. </p> <p>The threat of having my baby taken away was always hanging over me from then on. It was always: \"If you do that again, you have to hand your child over.\" Meanwhile, white girls were fighting left, right and centre, and it was ignored. A lot of the black girls just let it go because they want to get their parole and go home early. It shouldn't be like that.</p> <p> <strong> Andrew Evans, 45</strong><br> <strong>Sentence: life (overturned)</strong><br> <strong>Crime: murder (wrongly convicted) </strong> </p> <p> A part of me had to die to survive in prison. When you first come in you see somebody being beaten up and the instinct is to help. In prison you realise you can't. Your normal social awareness has to be disposed of. You have to let the horrors of prison wash over you, or you go insane. It's a psychological and emotional bludgeoning that goes on every day. You hear the screams at night when you first go into prison and it terrifies you because you think: \"What the hell's going on?\" After a while you realise that it's people cracking up because they can't take it any more. </p> <p>Occasionally the guards will be fed up with someone or will have had a bad day with the wife and want to take it out on someone. That's the way they are. </p> <p>Whatever crime somebody commits isn't the problem. That's the symptom. Until society gets to grip with that there will never be a reduction in crime.

      "bodyText": "Sharon Corzon, 26 Sentence: five years Crime: GBH This was my first sentence and I got the maximum you could get for GBH because I'm black and the girl I attacked was white. That's what I think. The three prisons I've been in have all been prejudiced against black people. White girls can be so rude to the officers - they can swear at them, they can be really insulting and give the officer no respect, and they can get away with it. But if you just say \"no\" and you're black, you're in trouble. As a black person you have to hold back. You have to pretend. You have to creep. You have to keep quiet. You have to be so humble and stupid to survive as a black person in prison, and that's just not me. That's not my personality. I wasn't going to pretend to be something I wasn't. It's the officers rather than the inmates who are racist. Black officers are few and far between. In Holloway there are more because it's in London, but the sad thing is that because they're in the minority they don't speak out against the racism. In fact, I've found they are more prejudiced against the black people. Racism is institutionalised. Who can you complain to? You can't complain to the officer that's being horrible to someone. She'll just make your life hell. You can't complain to the governor because it's his job to back up the officer. You can't complain to the board because it's their job to back up the governor. You're fucked. I took my prison to court because they were trying to take my baby away from me. After about five months being pregnant in the mother and baby unit, I was told I wasn't allowed to keep my baby because they thought I would endanger other mothers because of my temper. It was insulting and they were proved wrong because I won my court case and was allowed to keep my baby. I was sure that was racist as well because the board saw three pregnant black girls in the same week as me and they all got refused permission to keep their babies. The threat of having my baby taken away was always hanging over me from then on. It was always: \"If you do that again, you have to hand your child over.\" Meanwhile, white girls were fighting left, right and centre, and it was ignored. A lot of the black girls just let it go because they want to get their parole and go home early. It shouldn't be like that. Andrew Evans, 45 Sentence: life (overturned) Crime: murder (wrongly convicted) A part of me had to die to survive in prison. When you first come in you see somebody being beaten up and the instinct is to help. In prison you realise you can't. Your normal social awareness has to be disposed of. You have to let the horrors of prison wash over you, or you go insane. It's a psychological and emotional bludgeoning that goes on every day. You hear the screams at night when you first go into prison and it terrifies you because you think: \"What the hell's going on?\" After a while you realise that it's people cracking up because they can't take it any more. Occasionally the guards will be fed up with someone or will have had a bad day with the wife and want to take it out on someone. That's the way they are. Whatever crime somebody commits isn't the problem. That's the symptom. Until society gets to grip with that there will never be a reduction in crime. The problem is why they commit the crime in the first place. People say, \"Oh, it's because they're short of money.\" That's one reason. But the reason they are short of money is because they can't fit into what everyone considers normal society. So the only way for them to cope is to opt out of the system - into this other system called crime. What society needs to start thinking about is how to stop all these people opting out. They come into prison after going to the boys' home, the girls' home, the foster home; they've been abused and maltreated from the day they were born. It's like a cycle - they have kids and their kids start coming in. And for the people there now there is no rehabilitation. The only thing prison does is remove the problem from society for a while - and then place it back in society worse than it was before. There is some education in prison and it does benefit some people. But what the hell are people supposed to do when they get out? They can't get a job.

The estimate - much lower than an earlier announcement by the Indian defence minister of a potential 100,000 fatalities - is based on the number of bodies covered, those reported missing, an approximate number still lying under debris and other reports gathered by government agencies. Haren Pandya, home minister of Gujurat, said: \"The figure I am giving you today is closest to the truth\". The statement was made an hour after the state's emergency control room had said 7,162 corpses had been recovered. The statistics emerged after rescue teams managed to pull more survivors out alive, as bulldozers and explosives experts began clearing away the rubble. 22-year-old Kuntal Thakkar was rescued in the town of Bhachau after a Russian rescue team heard her screaming when a bulldozer smashed down a wall in her three-storey apartment building. They also found her husband alive, five days after the earthquake struck. In Bhuj, close to the epicentre of earthquake, an army team rescued a 12-year-old girl named Viyanka and rushed her to hospital.

Mr Lindo, 41, was stopped 37 times by police over an eight-year period and was the victim of three unlawful arrests. A report into Mr Lindo's complaints by a deputy assistant commissioner, Tarique Ghaffur, concluded he had been the the victim of harassment as a result of racial stereotyping. The inquiry found that the collective failures of the Met had put the force at serious risk of undermining the confidence of minority ethnic communities in Haringey. Mr Todd also apologised to Mr Lindo for including his address in the report which was published on the internet on Monday night. He said the Met had been reluctant to release the report and put it on the internet in haste when it was realised it was likely to be published elsewhere. But Mr Lindo will have to wait for a public apology from the deputy commissioner, Ian Blair. The report recommended that he should receive one but Mr Todd said: \"He will decide when and how and in what venue an apology should be given.\" Responding to an emotional challenge from Mr Lindo during a Metropolitan Police Association press briefing, Mr Todd said Scotland Yard had launched an inquiry into leaks that have occurred since the inquiry team delivered their findings in November. Of particular concern to Mr Lindo was how a comment - apparently made at a private meeting - that he was seeking \u00a31m in damages had been leaked to the press. Challenged by reporters on why no officers were facing disciplinary action over the three unlawful arrests, Mr Todd said the police were still waiting for reports from the police complaints authority. The report has provoked a backlash within the Met. Officers who came into contact with Mr Lindo feel harshly treated as they were not interviewed by the inquiry team. Mr Todd said he accepted that officers had not been given an opportunity to put their view to the inquiry, but this was because it had been compiled in a \"groundbreaking style\" which had examined organisational procedures based on written reports. The MPA chairman, Toby Harris, said the group had asked the Met to submit an action plan addressing the report's recommendations. \"We need to be open about what has gone on, and it is now important that the MPA works with the Met, the Lindo family and the community to ensure that the recommendations are implemented as speedily as possible,\" he said. \"Too many people have been waiting too long to see progress in this particular case, and there are major issues highlighted by the report that need to be urgently addressed.\"",

I tried to keep myself to myself when I was inside, so I didn't experience much racism. When I arrived on the first day there were some people having a go, but I just tried to ignore it. In Thorncross, some of the other Asian lads had got into a lot of trouble because of racist attitudes from other inmates, but basically it wasn't dealt with as racism because it always resulted in a lot of fighting. People would attack the Asians, they would have to fight to defend themselves, and then it was the Asians who were given extra days on their sentence and sent to the block as punishment. There's not really anyone you can turn to about that sort of thing, and if you do start to report racism because of the mentality in prison you're just seen as a grass.",

His experience within the turbulent internet startup culture has made him sensitive to the needs of small businesses, he said, and he hopes to make it easier for small companies to communicate with government. He also hopes that the civil service will be able to learn from the internet economy. \"We will see some slow changes in the civil service. It will take a long time, but then to turn around a big company like IBM or Ford takes a long time. \"This week we had permanent secretaries coming to listen to Michael Dell speak about his experiences. So there is a willingness to change within the civil service,\" Mr Pinder added. Welcoming Mr Pinder's decision to take on the job fulltime, Mr Blair said: \"We are determined to meet the goals of our UK Online campaign, putting this country at the forefront of the knowledge economy. Andrew can play a leading role in achieving that.\" Related articles 28.01.2001: Britain set to outsmart Europe 12.11.2000: The e-envoy is dead; long live the e-envoy 01.10.2000: Only the right e-envoy can put Britain's mouse in order Useful links UK Online portal",

      "body": "<p>Lisa Peel was supposed to be smacked up, but she has been clean for a while - been through the \"rattle\". There can't be many worse places to go through the rattle than a housing estate outside Middlesbrough. High-gloss pink kitchen walls; cold turkey in the afternoon in the corner of the sitting room where Lovejoy leaps about the screen with Joanna Lumley. </p> <p>Outside, the atmosphere on the estate is heavy with heroin. It's in the agitated gait of the young men hurrying by as if they are going to miss the last train to somewhere important. It's in the rigid, heads-down march of two women across the road hoping that if they push their prams fast enough their kids won't be infected. </p> <p>Ms Peel's life of addiction, abuse and confusion may have nothing to do with her mother's life spent in and out of prison. She certainly doesn't blame her mother, although she does wish she had been around more. \"The first time my mum went into prison I was two and a half. I remember going to see her with my dad. He told me that she was in hospital but I kept asking where the bed was. Then, after the visit, she went back through a door to the cells and they said 'kids aren't allowed in there'.\" </p> <p>This year, around 44,000 children will lose their mother, or father, to Her Majesty's prisons. Ms Peel's mother, Julie Miller, has already served six sentences for everything from driving while banned to cheque-book fraud, and is halfway through a seventh. \"I committed child abuse by leaving her,\" she says. </p> <p>Ms Peel is softer on her mother. \"She was a heroin addict and she had mental health problems. She needed help, my mum.\" </p> <p>Diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic in 1991, Miller, now 37, was a regular at St Luke's psychiatric hospital in Middlesbrough. The day before her last crime, she arrived at St Luke's in an agitated state and was sent home with 60 sleeping tablets. Once home, she added diazepam (tranquillisers) and crack cocaine to the mix and went out to rob the local Spar with a kitchen knife. Her sister was behind the till; she held the knife to her throat. She got four and a half years. </p> <p>She began her sentence on her daughter's 18th birthday. That was the night Ms Peel started on the path to heroin addiction. \"I'd tried it three times before, but that night I just wanted to get wasted. I'm not blaming my mum - I might have ending up doing it anyway. But that's when it really started. </p> <p>\"I was on my own in the house with \u00a342 a week. Social services didn't know anything about me. The night the police arrested my mother they boarded up the doors. I said to them: 'Hey, I live here,' and they said: 'We'll give you some time to get your stuff out.' After that I always [saw] people around who were taking it. I could do what I liked, she was locked up.\" </p> <p>Ms Peel remembers the second time her mother went to jail. She was six or seven years old. \"They told me she was 'working away'. She got 22 months for driving while banned. I had to stay with her girlfriend. I think she was jealous of the love my mum had for me and she hit me. I didn't tell my mum she was beating me then because Heather said she'd kill me if I told and I believed her. </p> <p>\"She went into prison for the fifth time when I was 16. She was really sick then. She was on heroin and crack. When she went inside that time, I just stayed in the house. </p> <p>\"I dropped out of college. I would probably have stayed on if she was around. But word got out that my ma was inside. People started saying she was a smackhead and I was living in a smack house. So I stayed at home. I really missed her then. We were close, me and my ma: there was only 17 years between us. We used to go to the pub together.\" </p> <p>Miller is serving out her sentence in one of the country's more progressive prisons, Low Newton, near Durham, where the drug-rehabilitation programme is the only one of its kind in Britain. It is 2.45pm; visiting time. Inside the main gates a drug-sniffing spaniel is circling the 20 or so children who have been brought in to see their mothers. For the most part it seems to be the grandmothers and sisters, not the men, who have brought the kids. </p> <p>The women and children sit around white Formica tables in the prison's old dining room. The walls are painted yel low, and there is a play area for children. </p> <p>Tracy Lally, 32, has five children. She has been a heroin addict since she was 16 and hasn't seen her kids for over a year. \"Two of my kids are up for adoption and I'm happy about that. Their foster mother is great. It's my eight-year-old, Kyle, I worry about. He was four and a half when I was taken from him and he said: 'Ma, why don't you just climb over the fence? They can't keep you in here, they are not your ma and da.' \" </p> <p>Low Newton's governor, Mike Kirby, surveys the scene. He has worked in some of the country's harshest prisons. One of his worst memories was of a scene in the visiting room at Warrington in Cheshire. \"The father came in with the son. I think he was about five and he didn't understand that his mother was in a prison and she wasn't leaving with them. At the end of visiting time he grabbed her waist and wouldn't let her go. He started screaming that he didn't want to leave her. It was tragic, really tragic. It upset everyone.\" </p> <p>Diana Rogan, 32, is with her two children, aged 11 and 13. A former heroin addict serving five years for supplying heroin, she is due to be released at the end of 2002. Her son says: \"The other kids used to come up and say, 'Your ma is in prison,' but now they've stopped. Sometimes I had to shout at them. I like coming to see my ma and I never cry because it upsets my ma.\" </p> <p>For some children, keeping their parent's imprisonment hidden is a burden. Jill remembers taking her son to Durham prison to see his father for the first time. \"I didn't know the way, so I asked someone in the street and my son, Owen, said to me after: 'Ma, why did you have to go and do that? Now everyone will know my da is in prison.'\" </p> <p>Owen often tried to make excuses not to go and see his father. Durham, a high-security prison, can be a traumatic place for children. \"They get stressed out. They think their dad is working there and ask me: 'Do you work here with my dad, do you drive the big white van [the prison transfer van] like my dad?' \" says Christine Slassor of the North-East Prison After-Care Society (Nepac). \"When they go in they are searched - shoes, coats, everything. They take off their watches and belts and go through a scanner. Then they have to stand in line while sniffer dogs search them for drugs.\" </p> <p>The biggest problem for most kids is understanding where and why their mother has gone. \"When I was about seven and she went back in,\" says Ms Peel, \"I couldn't understand why she had just gone and left me.\" </p> <p>Joshua was eight when his mother was sent to Low Newton. \"She said she was going to her friend's. She called a taxi, and the taxi just came and drove her here.\" </p> <p>Joanne Moss is also on the drug rehabilitation programme at the prison. \"My son, who's four, took it very bad. He started taking his shoes off and hiding them to get attention. Or taking off his clothes. I went on home leave and he never left my side; he was holding on to me all the time. When he comes to see me there are tantrums and I wonder sometimes if it would be better for him not to come, but I'm desperate to see him. It's hard.\" </p> <p>In October, Britain's prison service will offer an alternative to prison for some addicts - compulsory treatment in the community. The drugs testing and treatment order is, says the Howard League for Penal Reform, \"a big step in the right direction\". </p> <p>Twenty years ago, such a programme might have given Lisa Peel back her mother. \"I did nothing wrong. I know she had to suffer for what she did, but the kids shouldn't have to suffer as well. I have never been in trouble with the police - never had a caution, never. I don't care what anybody says, you need your mum.\" </p> <p>Help for children of imprisoned parents is available from the Federation of Prisoners and Family Support Groups on 020-8741 4578. It has links to a national support network.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Rita Howe-Douglas<br><strong>Principal of Catherine House Day Nursery, Birmingham</strong><br> </p> <p>My nursery is the one accused of giving children sex education lessons with Claire Rayner's The Body Book. In fact, we have given no such lessons; we have topics such as \"growing\" or \"my body\". If the children ask questions about sex as a result of our topics or because someone they know is pregnant, we always answer them honestly and simply. Often they don't want to know any more than that a baby comes from mummy's tummy. I used The Body Book with my children and they have grown up into happy, well-adjusted adults who don't go in and out of sexual relationships lightly. <br><strong>Verdict: No</strong></p> <p><strong> Claire Rayner </strong><br><strong> Agony aunt and author of The Body Book </strong><br> </p> <p>Basically, you answer a child's question when a child asks it rather than sitting down with them at the age of three, or even older, and giving them a talk about sex. If you are relaxed and comfortable with yourself, a very small child will look at you and point to a breast or a penis and ask what it is. What is important is that children know about sex before their own hormones kick in and sex becomes a subject of giggles and embarrassment. The younger they are, the more normal and natural sex seems, but you don't have to give them every single nut and bolt. <br><strong>Verdict: No</strong></p> <p><strong>Jim Richards </strong><br><strong> Director of the Catholic Children's Society </strong><br> </p> <p>The sexual act must be seen as part of the loving relationship between parents. That should be the starting point and the moral framework in which to respond honestly to children's questions. For a three- or four-year-old who asks where they came from, it might be enough to say \"from mummy's tummy\". Parents shouldn't elaborate beyond the intellectual capacity of the child. If a parent responds openly to a child's early questions, the child will feel able to return to the subject. Parents need to know what the school's sex education curriculum is and be happy with it. <br><strong>Verdict: No</strong></p> <p><strong> Simon Blake </strong><br><strong> Director of the Sex Education Forum </strong><br> </p> <p>A clear and simple sex education book designed for children is a good way to introduce them to sex. What is really worrying for children is when adults skirt around the issue of sex and talk about storks and gooseberry bushes. We can't afford to let another generation grow up with the guilt and embarrassment that previous generations have had. We must answer children honestly to bring about a shift in culture. In places where sex education begins earlier, there are lower rates of teenage pregnancy and young people are less likely to have sexual experiences that they regret afterwards. <br><strong>Verdict: No</strong></p> <p><strong> Tuppy Owens</strong><br><strong> Spokesperson for the Sexual FreedomCoalition</strong><br> </p> <p>I think sex education for children should be gradual, continual and responsive to their questions. My whole family has always been very open about sex. I remember my mum called it \"having it\"; I called it \"having it off\"; and my brother called \"having it up\", which made us all laugh. It's important to laugh with children about things like that. Older children should learn that sex under 16 is illegal and how to say no to sex. It is incredibly damaging to make sex a naughty, dirty taboo where children are concerned. <br><strong>Verdict: No</strong></p> <p><strong> Sheila Wolfendale</strong><br><strong> Professor of educational psychology at East London Uni </strong><br> </p> <p>What is important is that children's questions are answered in an age-appropriate way, mindful of the gender of the child and sensitive to their situation.

      "body": "<p>Five thousand nappies. More than 6,500 bottles of formula milk. Clothing studs popped 40,000 times. The numbers involved with rearing three babies for the first year of their lives are daunting enough, but nothing matches living through it, as we have just done. </p> <p>One morning last week our triplets became one-year-olds. At 9.43, I fell into a melancholy weep. A year to the minute after my three babies were born, the memories flooded back. The emergency caesarean, two months premature. Peeping through the crack in the operating theatre doors. The blood. The cries. The placentas (huge!). Then following the incubators to the neonatal unit. </p> <p>How different everything is now from then. The teeth, the talking, the crawling, the walking. At 9.43, I cuddled one boy to sleep and fed milk to the other while my slightly mad daughter cackled at the stripes on the sofa, as Holst's Jupiter played in the background. Jupiter - joy bringer - was the music playing in the car when they came home from hospital, the music that signified the end of life as we knew it. </p> <p>For years, my partner Diane had looked forward to nurturing a baby, cuddling and feeding and loving it. Then IVF sprang a surprise on us and we got three at once. Everyone said coping with one baby was the toughest thing possible. We had been braced for twins - they run in Diane's family - but triplets? Triple the work, but also triple the joy, surely? Triple the work, yes. But joy - not at first. It was utter hell. </p> <p>We had the first inkling of what it was going to be like after the kids had spent a month in the neonatal unit. We could take them home, they said, after we had cared for them for a week in a side room off the ward - with the safety net of the nurses being just outside the door. </p> <p>That first night we were constantly jolted awake by our trio's collection of farmyard noises - the sheep, the goat, the creaking gate. It was the same when we got them home, except that we had our own room to sleep in. Not that we spent much time in it. </p> <p>We took turns to spring out of bed and answer their hungry cries, moving fast to stop them waking the others. We jumped out of bed so frequently that neither of us was getting enough rest. So we started sleeping in shifts, five hours each, crossing paths at 2am. Finally, we alternated the nights, one sleeping until morning, the other getting up six times a night. </p> <p>Some days, friends would come to help Diane while I was at work. And two trainee nursery nurses did placements, making things a bit easier. But it could be so hard when she was on her own that I took a baby to the office twice, letting them sleep on my chest or in the crook of my arm while I tapped at my computer in a very unergonomic pose. But Diane was still there, day in, day out. After seven months she cut short her maternity leave and went back to work while I became house dad and administered most of the week's 100 nappies. </p> <p>We were never party animals, but we liked to go out with friends and lie in all weekend. My pet hates were being tired, hungry and unwashed. Now I am all three simultaneously. If we ever get near hot water, it is in a bath so we can get at least one of the children clean as well. And my clothes are invariably smeared with rusk, milk and sick. We have lost touch with people. There is no time for phone calls or letter writing, and visitors only get half a conversation as we dash around. </p> <p>We have been out only twice since the kids came home from hospital - we need two experienced babysitters to cope. Even now it takes two hours to clear up after they have gone to bed at 8.30pm - sterilising bottles, washing dishes, clearing fallen food from the floor, tidying away toys. Going out is not really feasible. And we do not usually get our food until 9pm, but at least it is now recognisable as a meal rather than the peanut butter on toast that featured heavily in my diet for the first six months. </p> <p>Apart from the logistics of day-to-day living, the biggest problem is getting out with the triplets. Living on the fourth floor of a block with no lift means a quick trip to the swings is not on the cards. It usually takes two adults to carry the trio and their bag downstairs, although one person can do it at a push, using car seats to ferry them down a landing at a time. But the run-up to getting out of the door is crucial, as it takes an hour to get them changed and packed. The trick is to judge their hunger, tiredness and bowel movements so they will allow you to strap them into their buggies without shouting the block down. </p> <p>When we do get out, the places we can go are limited - the park and a couple of supermarkets and larger shops. The likes of Mothercare do not feature on our list, as friends have given us all the kids' clothes and most of their toys. Our main outlay was for their transport: \u00a3900 in total for quad, twin and single buggies so they can go out in any permutation. </p> <p>Plywood has also made a dent in our single income: I am rebuilding the kitchen. I had intended to fix it in the three months I had taken off work before their due date. But Diane was rushed into hospital for a two-month stay and I spent the time visiting her, and later the kids. The DIY has been restricted to weekends, when the kids could be taken out, so it is still unfinished. Meanwhile, the rugrats have become more mobile, so we have had to convert the living area into a giant playpen, with everything now above shoulder height. </p> <p>But things are getting easier as the kids get older. Instead of bottles eight times a day each, main meals are taken in highchairs at the table. They still need bottles of milk, but two like feeding themselves, so there is not as much screaming as a few months ago when they could not hold anything and all wanted a bottle at once. </p> <p>They also entertain themselves, so we do not have to go to a playgroup to find someone for them to chase around the floor. But they do get jealous, especially if they are all hungry, or tired, or both. Then a quiet life relies on juggling their needs and self-feeding capabilities while judging who will fall asleep (and more importantly stay asleep) first. </p> <p>The trio have wildly different personalities and are good at different things, which is great as they learn from each other. Whenever one does anything new - rolling over, holding bottles, talking, crawling - the others are sure to follow within a week or two. The final one to crawl did so because the others kept stealing his toys. Now we are having a laugh as they start to walk, staggering round like a bunch of old drunks. The Pythonesque face slapping when two are annoyed with each other is a giggle, too. </p> <p>We have coped simply because there has been no other option, and now they are toddlers things are going to get easier, kind of. For them, their birthday was just another day. For us, it was a liberation. Now we can chuck the steriliser and give them ready-made foods containing salt, and they are close to sleeping through. And in a year they can start their potty training. Only another 5,000 nappies to go.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Book of the month</strong></p> <p><strong>Bloodtide by Melvin Burgess (Penguin, \u00a35.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99)</strong> </p> <p>What's the difference between Melvin Burgess and many other writers for children and young adults? The difference is that Burgess doesn't just tell rollicking good stories; he writes brilliantly, too. There is a real passion here, and he spares the reader nothing. </p> <p>As with Burgess's most notorious book, Junk, this is a warts-and-all tale about human nature. Loosely based on the Volsunga saga - written in the 13th century in Icelandic - it tells of teenaged twins Siggy and Signy, the offspring of Val Volson, who owns half of London and enters into a treaty with his archenemy Connor. </p> <p>Set a century or so hence, after the government has moved out of London, leaving the city to be fought over by warring gangs, this is a terrifying, gruesome and utterly compelling story of human cruelty, the struggle for power, the urge for revenge and our need for love. </p> <p>There is no sense that Burgess has censored himself; instead, he has been driven by his own hurtling imagination and the urgency of the story. A bone-hard, brilliant book. </p> <p><strong> Ages 0-3</strong></p> <p><strong> Hug by Jez Alborough (Walker, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>A book for anyone who has ever felt they needed a hug. Bobo the little chimp wants a hug. Everywhere he turns in the jungle, he sees mummies and babies - elephants, giraffes and lions - having hugs. Even the hippos are snuggling. But the lost Bobo has nobody to hug him. Then his mum finds him again and soon the entire jungle is having a giant cross-species hug-in. </p> <p>The word hug is almost the only text in this clever little book; the big, bright pictures dance off the page with such exuberance that you can't help but feel happy while you are looking at it. Even the expressions on the faces of the animals are all subtly different. As fine a demonstration as you can get that books are not just about reading, but about feelings. </p> <p><strong> Really Brave Tim by John Prater (Red Fox, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99)</strong> </p> <p>A neat little picture book that explores the things that scare us in a gently humorous fashion. In Tim's den, Millie, Suki and Billie are boasting about how brave they are. When Billie tells of his adventure in the dark forest, Millie tells how she swam with sharks and Suki recounts climbing to the top of the world, Tim keeps quiet because he is afraid of the dark, water and heights. But there is one thing that everyone else is afraid of and Tim isn't: spiders. </p> <p>A simple text is complemented by atmospheric illustrations. But the best thing about this book is the way it combines the strange with the everyday - so you never really know whether there might be goblins playing football in the woods or dragons waiting outside sweetshops to snaffle your extra-strong mints. </p> <p><strong>Ages 4-7</strong></p> <p><strong> The Boy Who Became an Eagle by Kathryn Cave, illust. by Nick Maland (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a38.99; CultureShop price \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> This wonderful book has the enduring feel of a myth or a fable and leaves you with a pang in your heart and a sense of loss. It concerns a shepherd boy who discovers that he can fly. Something inside him tells him it would be wise to keep it a secret, but a travelling showman discovers his gift and puts the boy in his show. The boy is a sensation, but he longs for his family and home; then he has the misfortune to be kidnapped by thieves who want to discover the secret of flight. </p> <p>Cave's prose is as spare as winter and has a restrained icy beauty while it niggles away at ideas about freedom and the need for a home. Maland's brilliant, detailed drawings conjure up a sense of both claustrophobia and wide open spaces where the imagination can soar. </p> <p> <strong> Tiger and Me by Kaye Umansky, illust. by Susie Jenkin-Pearce (Red Fox, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99)</strong> </p> <p> We speak of childhood being a time of freedom, yet most small children spend their lives being coerced into doing things they don't really want to.

      "bodyText": "Book of the month Bloodtide by Melvin Burgess (Penguin, \u00a35.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99) What's the difference between Melvin Burgess and many other writers for children and young adults? The difference is that Burgess doesn't just tell rollicking good stories; he writes brilliantly, too. There is a real passion here, and he spares the reader nothing. As with Burgess's most notorious book, Junk, this is a warts-and-all tale about human nature. Loosely based on the Volsunga saga - written in the 13th century in Icelandic - it tells of teenaged twins Siggy and Signy, the offspring of Val Volson, who owns half of London and enters into a treaty with his archenemy Connor. Set a century or so hence, after the government has moved out of London, leaving the city to be fought over by warring gangs, this is a terrifying, gruesome and utterly compelling story of human cruelty, the struggle for power, the urge for revenge and our need for love. There is no sense that Burgess has censored himself; instead, he has been driven by his own hurtling imagination and the urgency of the story. A bone-hard, brilliant book. Ages 0-3 Hug by Jez Alborough (Walker, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99) A book for anyone who has ever felt they needed a hug. Bobo the little chimp wants a hug. Everywhere he turns in the jungle, he sees mummies and babies - elephants, giraffes and lions - having hugs. Even the hippos are snuggling. But the lost Bobo has nobody to hug him. Then his mum finds him again and soon the entire jungle is having a giant cross-species hug-in. The word hug is almost the only text in this clever little book; the big, bright pictures dance off the page with such exuberance that you can't help but feel happy while you are looking at it. Even the expressions on the faces of the animals are all subtly different. As fine a demonstration as you can get that books are not just about reading, but about feelings. Really Brave Tim by John Prater (Red Fox, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) A neat little picture book that explores the things that scare us in a gently humorous fashion. In Tim's den, Millie, Suki and Billie are boasting about how brave they are. When Billie tells of his adventure in the dark forest, Millie tells how she swam with sharks and Suki recounts climbing to the top of the world, Tim keeps quiet because he is afraid of the dark, water and heights. But there is one thing that everyone else is afraid of and Tim isn't: spiders. A simple text is complemented by atmospheric illustrations. But the best thing about this book is the way it combines the strange with the everyday - so you never really know whether there might be goblins playing football in the woods or dragons waiting outside sweetshops to snaffle your extra-strong mints. Ages 4-7 The Boy Who Became an Eagle by Kathryn Cave, illust. by Nick Maland (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a38.99; CultureShop price \u00a36.99) This wonderful book has the enduring feel of a myth or a fable and leaves you with a pang in your heart and a sense of loss. It concerns a shepherd boy who discovers that he can fly. Something inside him tells him it would be wise to keep it a secret, but a travelling showman discovers his gift and puts the boy in his show. The boy is a sensation, but he longs for his family and home; then he has the misfortune to be kidnapped by thieves who want to discover the secret of flight. Cave's prose is as spare as winter and has a restrained icy beauty while it niggles away at ideas about freedom and the need for a home. Maland's brilliant, detailed drawings conjure up a sense of both claustrophobia and wide open spaces where the imagination can soar. Tiger and Me by Kaye Umansky, illust. by Susie Jenkin-Pearce (Red Fox, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) We speak of childhood being a time of freedom, yet most small children spend their lives being coerced into doing things they don't really want to. We may ask them what they want for tea but we seldom assume this age group has opinions about the world. This book suggests children can change how the world is. The simple poem tells of a little girl who goes to the jungle. There, a tiger tells her how unbearable his life has become since his brothers were captured and sent to the zoo. She returns home, tells his story to anyone who will listen and starts a campaign to free the tigers and send them back to the jungle. This is a simple but empowering book, particularly for children who have just started school and been turned into little conformists. Ages 8-11 Spellfall by Katherine Roberts (The Chicken House,\u00a310.99; CultureShop price \u00a38.99) Natalie sees what she thinks is a leaf in the supermarket car park. But the leaf turns out to be a spell and puts Natalie, who has powers she did not know about, in enormous danger. This is a thrilling tale of kidnap, unlikely friendship, magic and sheer pluck, as Natalie finds herself a pawn between two worlds: the mysterious, magical world of Earthaven, the original home of her dead mother, and that of the exiled spellmage who wants to use her power for his own purposes. Like so much of the current output of children's publishing houses, this is not great literature but is a great read: Roberts knows exactly how to rack up the tension and create parallel universes. Here there are unicorns and huge trees that talk, and everything seems as believable as our own world. My Brother's Ghost by Allan Ahlberg (Penguin Puffin, \u00a33.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) Buy this book, and not just for your children and teenagers. Grans, grandads, mums and dads will appreciate this slim ghost story that is also a beautiful evocation of a grim 1950s childhood. The traditional paperback format may not be quite as enticing as the hardback version, which was like a little jewel, but what is inside remains wondrous: a tender story about how being haunted can save your life, about the ties that bind and how being an orphan isn't a bit like being Harry Potter. Ahlberg's novella is strongly autobiographical: he writes about childhood with a distance that somehow brings it into sharp focus, so that you can smell the gasworks, see the glitter of November rain on the headstones in the cemetery and feel the shock of the cold, scummy canal water. Ages 12+ Bluebeard's Castle by Gene Kemp (Faber and Faber, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) Psychologist Bruno Bettleheim suggested that fairy tales teach children how to live. The old stories live on, but the best writers - including Gene Kemp - find new ways to frame them. Sharon, the eldest sister of three kids from London's east end - Marie, Gary and Ems - becomes the teenage bride of Magnus Moore, a famous millionaire and movie-maker. When the younger children are invited to stay at his castle at the Wonderland theme park, they discover something very nasty in the dungeons. It takes all their courage and ingenuity to save their sister and bring Magnus to justice. Kemp's racy read takes Perrault's tale and puts it firmly in the here and now - a world of single-parent families, absent fathers, celebrity mania, kids who talk back and stroppy heroines. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (Doubleday, \u00a310.99; CultureShop price \u00a38.99) Who reached the north pole first? Matthew Henson. Who pioneered blood banks? Dr Charles Drew. Who performed open-heart surgery first? Dr Daniel Williams. Heard of any of them? Probably not - almost certainly because they are black. Blackman cleverly plays with these names in this Romeo and Juliet-style story set in a segregated world in which blacks (known as Crosses) rule over whites (known as Noughts), who have turned to terrorism to survive. If the writing lacks poetry, the plotting certainly doesn't lack drive. The narrative develops in a wholly credible way as teenagers Sephy (a Cross) and Callum (a Nought) find themselves facing infinitely more difficult obstacles than Shakespeare's lovers and have to choose where their loyalties lie. \u0095 Off the shelf can be used with the Guardian website Books Unlimited to build a library of children's classics.

And I really wanted to be normal.\" Until Jennifer Lauck, 37, wrote her bestselling memoir, Blackbird: A Childhood Lost, she hardly spoke of, or even thought about, her childhood. She spent the early years of that childhood looking after her adored, terminally ill mother, Janet: \"She saw me in the way that a mother really should see a child and often doesn't.\" </p> <p>Growing up with her brother, BJ, in Nevada and California, Lauck was changing her mother's catheter bag, washing the soiled bed linen and saving her mother from overdosing when she was six or seven. Instead of dwelling on the experience, Lauck \"put on a tough attitude\" and got a life. She married at 19, though the relationship did not last, and, after university, won several awards for TV news journalism. Then she moved into PR and ran a company in Portland, Oregon, where she lives with her second husband Steve, an auctioneer, and their three-year-old son, Spencer. </p> <p>\"In my early 30s I came to a stop. I was pretty much burned out career-wise,\" she says. \"And that's when everything seemed to catch up with me. It was the first time I'd slowed down enough to investigate the causes of my mother's death. At first I did it like a reporter, getting medical records from the hospital. It was never intended to be a book; more a journal of sorts. </p> <p>\"But when I got pregnant on the anniversary of my mother's death - I was 33, the same age that she was when she died - I said to my husband, 'This is a sign, an invitation.' Then six weeks before my son was due, my waters broke on Mother's Day, May 11, my mother's birthday. She really didn't want to be forgotten. Writing the book became a pilgrimage to her, to reclaim this beautiful woman.\" </p> <p>These coincidences, which went down well on Oprah, would be less impressive if Lauck's memoir were not so riveting. Through the child's eyes, we see Lauck as a five-year-old carrying coffee and toast through to her mother on a tray each morning, and learning about make-up and clothes as her mother gets ready - \"put together\", she calls it - in the style of Jackie Kennedy. </p> <p>There are bad days when Janet (left semi-paralysed by a botched operation to remove a tumour from her spine) can't get out of bed at all, and these days get worse once Lauck's father decides that she should see new doctors in California. She is admitted to hospital and the family moves to Los Angeles to be near her. </p> <p>For Lauck, school is peripheral; friends are not on the cards because if your mom is sick and cannot pick you up you are not normal. The workaholic dad is hardly around at all. Janet dies in 1971, on BJ's 10th birthday. A few days before that, Lauck learns that she is adopted. Can it get worse? Yes - their father has already started an affair with another woman, the cold, obsessive Deb, and soon they are living with her and her three children. Life is grim - but not half as grim as when the father dies of a sudden heart attack and Deb abandons Lauck, leaving her to earn her keep, aged 10, in a Freedom Church commune in LA. \"Figure it out ... it's called survival,\" says Deb as a parting shot. </p> <p>This is not a grisly Californian self-help memoir-as-therapy. Lauck, a driven journalist, knows how to write and structure. She used her mother's medical reports as a preface because she felt the beginning of the book, when she describes her day at home, could be boring (it isn't) if the reader did not already know that something terrible was going to happen. \"It's a good lead. Don't bury your lead.\" </p> <p>But what about the shrinks, the drugs, the Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, the depression? Apparently there has been none of that, or not that much. She did a little therapy, \"in and out for about three or four years, just talking with this really wonderful man\". </p> <p>Remarkably, it wasn't until then that she \"realised what depression feels like. It really sucks. Now I understand why people take antidepressants. It's like an underlayer you can't surface from.\" She started Blackbird (as in \"Take these broken wings and learn to fly\") when Spencer was four months old, and finished it 14 months later. Compared to the writing, therapy sounds easy. </p> <p>\"I studied creative writing under this writer who uses a technique called 'dangerous writing'. It's brutal: you sweat and cry. He pushes you to the place you don't want to go: sometimes you've skimmed over it and he says, 'Stop right there.' That's where those scenes with the overdose, the pee bag and messed-up sheets came from. It's like the most concentrated form of analysis. I so wanted to get through it.\" </p> <p>Lauck says she is ready to move on. \"I was so committed to telling my mother's story. But I'd like to stop being the daughter for a while, just be myself.\" In fact it is Lauck's spirit, fortified by her mother's love, that resonates in Blackbird. On the last page she is reunited, aged 11, with her paternal grandparents. </p> <p>I am dying to know what happens next. Surely everything will be all right now that her family has reclaimed her? Lauck has already started writing the sequel, tentatively called Into the Fire (as in out of the frying pan). She lets me have a few juicy details and I see that there is a long way to go before anything is remotely all right - which makes Jennifer Lauck's thriving all the more remarkable. </p>",

An executive of a floated business is paid, on average, \u00a3170,000, only 10% less than a chief executive of an offline company. The rapid changes in the way technology bosses are rewarded - a direct result of the crash in hi-tech shares in the past year - means there is now little difference between their pay and that of bosses of more traditional companies. The survey, conducted by ePay for recruitment company Futurestep and compensation company SCA Consulting, found British internet executives the best paid in Europe. The study, which surveyed more than 2,000 senior executives in nine European countries, said that internet companies had been forced to restructure their pay packages to prevent executives moving on to less risky companies. \"Salary and bonus compensation has increased substantially in the last six months and in many instances by 50%. Internet executives predict that salaries will further increase by 10% this year,\" the survey said. Francesco Benincasa, chief executive and founder of ihavemoved.com, an internet company that notifies services about a change of address, says there is no longer a scrum for an extra 1% of stock options.",

      "body": "<p>The Foreign Office predicted today that United Nations sanctions against Libya could be lifted within weeks provided its leader, Muammar Gadafy, agrees to outstanding demands in connection with the Lockerbie bombing.</p> <p>The way was opened for an end to sanctions by the completion of the trial of two Libyans accused of planting a bomb on Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988. The stiff economic sanctions were imposed in 1992 in the wake of the bombing and were suspended in 1999 after Libya handed over the two men.</p> <p>Meetings between US, British and Libyan diplomats to discuss sanctions are scheduled within the next 48 hours in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and at the UN headquarters in New York.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We must now reflect on the verdict, study the reasoned judgment carefully and assess whether Libya has complied with the will of the international community as laid down in the UN resolutions.\"</p> <p>The key resolution made six demands on Libya: that it cease all forms of terrorism, surrender the two men for trial, disclose all it knows about the Lockerbie bombing, accepts responsibility for the actions of Libyan officials, pays appropriate compensation and cooperates in a French investigation into another terrorist action. \"Libya must comply with all these requirements,\" the Foreign Office spokesman said.</p> <p>If there is an appeal against the verdict, the lifting of sanctions could be delayed; it would then be a matter of months rather than weeks.</p> <p>While Col Gadafy has already complied in handing over the two Libyans, the Foreign Office will not advocate the lifting of sanctions until compensation is paid and, more difficult, Libya accepts responsibility. The Libyans have already indicated they will pay the compensation.</p> <p>The view of the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, since taking office in 1997 is that it is better to engage with countries such as Libya and others formerly classified as \"rogue\" states rather than leave them isolated. He restored relations with Libya in 1998 after a 15-year break. Against that background, Britain will be keen to see sanctions lifted.</p> <p>The view of the US is more complex. It maintains a tougher individual position towards Libya. The US state department shares the British view that UN sanctions should be lifted provided Col Gadafy complies with the remaining conditions.</p> <p>A US diplomat at the UN, John Cunningham, sat in last week on initial discussions at the UN with the British ambassador, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, and Libya's UN ambassador, Abuzed Omar Dorda.</p> <p>But the new US administration is made of hawks who may prove less amenable. The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, said Tuesday that regardless of the verdict, \"there are other things that the Libyan government will be expected to do\" regarding the UN sanctions.</p> <p>\"It would also be important to note that there are US sanctions that predate the UN sanctions that were not affected by the outcome of this trial,\" Mr Powell said.</p> <p>American sanctions include restrictions on trade and travel and a ban on US oil companies from operating there.</p> <p>Lifting the UN embargo will require a new security council resolution and the support - or abstention - of its five permanent members.</p> <p>\"The body language of the Libyans is that they will accept the verdict and want to move on,\" said a senior Foreign Office official.

      "bodyText": "The Foreign Office predicted today that United Nations sanctions against Libya could be lifted within weeks provided its leader, Muammar Gadafy, agrees to outstanding demands in connection with the Lockerbie bombing. The way was opened for an end to sanctions by the completion of the trial of two Libyans accused of planting a bomb on Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988. The stiff economic sanctions were imposed in 1992 in the wake of the bombing and were suspended in 1999 after Libya handed over the two men. Meetings between US, British and Libyan diplomats to discuss sanctions are scheduled within the next 48 hours in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and at the UN headquarters in New York. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We must now reflect on the verdict, study the reasoned judgment carefully and assess whether Libya has complied with the will of the international community as laid down in the UN resolutions.\" The key resolution made six demands on Libya: that it cease all forms of terrorism, surrender the two men for trial, disclose all it knows about the Lockerbie bombing, accepts responsibility for the actions of Libyan officials, pays appropriate compensation and cooperates in a French investigation into another terrorist action. \"Libya must comply with all these requirements,\" the Foreign Office spokesman said. If there is an appeal against the verdict, the lifting of sanctions could be delayed; it would then be a matter of months rather than weeks. While Col Gadafy has already complied in handing over the two Libyans, the Foreign Office will not advocate the lifting of sanctions until compensation is paid and, more difficult, Libya accepts responsibility. The Libyans have already indicated they will pay the compensation. The view of the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, since taking office in 1997 is that it is better to engage with countries such as Libya and others formerly classified as \"rogue\" states rather than leave them isolated. He restored relations with Libya in 1998 after a 15-year break. Against that background, Britain will be keen to see sanctions lifted. The view of the US is more complex. It maintains a tougher individual position towards Libya. The US state department shares the British view that UN sanctions should be lifted provided Col Gadafy complies with the remaining conditions. A US diplomat at the UN, John Cunningham, sat in last week on initial discussions at the UN with the British ambassador, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, and Libya's UN ambassador, Abuzed Omar Dorda. But the new US administration is made of hawks who may prove less amenable. The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, said Tuesday that regardless of the verdict, \"there are other things that the Libyan government will be expected to do\" regarding the UN sanctions. \"It would also be important to note that there are US sanctions that predate the UN sanctions that were not affected by the outcome of this trial,\" Mr Powell said. American sanctions include restrictions on trade and travel and a ban on US oil companies from operating there. Lifting the UN embargo will require a new security council resolution and the support - or abstention - of its five permanent members. \"The body language of the Libyans is that they will accept the verdict and want to move on,\" said a senior Foreign Office official. Speaking before today's ruling, he added: \"We are assuming Libya is still operating in a positive spirit and will put Lockerbie behind it whatever the verdict.\" Foreign Office officials say there is no evidence that Libya is involved now in acts of terrorism - a judgment which the US may not be willing to accept. Though they remain concerned about Col Gadafy's attempts to import or develop long-range missiles - an EU-wide arms embargo remains in place - one of the officials said: \"We have no illusions about aspects of Libya. But our assessment of Britain's strategic national interest is to have a dialogue.\" Foreign Office officials speak of a \"reasonable expectation\" Libya will meet UN conditions for the lifting of sanctions.

This contains principles aimed at securing a better understanding between the sector and government. </p> <p>The compact sets the scene for more joint working. This is within a policy framework that emphasises the importance and value of the sector in service delivery but also as a vehicle for participation, active citizenship and \"community building'\"(now a very popular term).</p> <p>Similarly, we see at the international level, and perhaps here it is even more pronounced, a growing awareness of the importance of NGOs. This is based on their role in policy formulation, acting as a check and balance against big money or narrow national interests.</p> <p>So the sector is now more feted than in has ever been. But it is also more subject to criticism. We are in this respect victims of our own success. </p> <p>In the good or bad old days, depending on your perspective, when we were perceived as the David challenging Goliath we could do no wrong. In these days of heightened media interest it sometimes feels as if we can do little right.</p> <p>Journalists of my acquaintance explain their changed attitude by emphasising that we can not expect to be treated differently from powerful public or private interests. They point to the many charities which are multi million pound businesses, and how ICT makes it relatively easy and inexpensive for us to undermine consumer conscious multi nationals or poll sensitive politicians. We are therefore deemed to have power. More notably we cause concern because our power is not checked by accountability to a mass electorate - as if this were the only accountability that matters.</p> <p>For the last four years NCVO has been engaged in a programme of work looking at trust and confidence in charities and other voluntary organisations. We believe based on our work that generally public trust and confidence in charities is high. However, the public now raise issues that we need to address if we are to sustain a high approval rating. The public are concerned about: fundraising practice; regulation; independence/distinctiveness.</p> <p>Fundraising practice, other operational issues and distinctiveness I will come back to later. I would like to start by saying a little about regulation.</p> <p>Regulation: There is a perception among the public that the sector is insufficiently regulated. This has perhaps been promoted by media stories which focus on particular cases of abuse. A recent example was War Child. The media often suggests that the cases come to the attention of the papers are simply the tip of the iceberg - that abuse is likely to be rife on the basis of a low level of reporting to the charity commission.</p> <p>We know that this isn't the case - cases like War Child are luckily relatively rare. They often first see the light of day, as in this case, because a trustee approached the charity commission to express concern.</p> <p>Further on the question of non reporting, it should be remembered that the vast majority of charities are not required to report because they are too small and also that levels of charity reporting are not necessarily any worse than those for purely commercial concerns.</p> <p>Many would argue that the sector does not necessarily need more regulation but more effective regulation and perhaps greater investment in self regulation.</p> <p>The problem could better be formulated perhaps as follows: There is no evidence of any scale of fraud and abuse in charities - rather the contrary. People generally have good instincts towards charity and would not seek to undermine it. Which does n't mean an extremely hard line should not be taken when fraud is detected, rather the contrary, since it constitutes a very serious abuse of trust.</p> <p>For me the issue for the sector and for NCVO is how can we support each other in developing the highest standards of practice in key areas such as fundraising, collaboration and consultation. </p> <p>Distinctiveness, fundraising and other operational issues </p> <p>NCVO public attitudes research published in 1998 revealed that the public want to support the sector because it is distinctive. It also indicated some concern about a blurring of boundaries between the sectors. The public respond to the belief that the voluntary or charitable sector has a different ethos, that it often meets urgent needs. It raises funds to enable it to do this. However, the research also pointed to some disquiet among the public about perceived increasing competitiveness for funds and aggressive fundraising.</p> <p>Part of our strength as a sector is that we are passionate about the causes that we pursue. This of course is a good thing but it does mean that sometimes some of us believe that the ends justify the means - this can lead to fundraising behaviour which might be questioned by independent observers. </p> <p>Malcolm Dean recently wrote in the Guardian about the NSPCC Full Stop campaign. He commented that the campaign set an unobtainable goal, that facts were distorted to add drama to the appeal. He also suggested that it caused confusion with another high profile campaign with which the NSPCC was involved - Children's Promise. </p> <p>For him the lessons were: 1. The importance of transparency. 2. Marketing departments should be kept under control and 3. Some action needs to be taken on fundraising and campaign costs. Malcolm Dean suggested that the ball was in the Charity Commission's court. I think we, as a sector, need to get our acts together and respond to these issues before the regulator feels obliged to.</p> <p>We tend to see ourselves as the critics, able to point to bad practice in the public or private sectors, seeing our own organisations as immune from criticism. This is now untenable. As local authorities attempt to improve their practice, in part through the implementation of best value, and as public authorities generally take on board human rights and anti -discrimination legislation, we may find that we are left behind. We do not have the same resources for review and change in our practices but we will need to find them. As the public sector becomes better at consultation, and providing services more tailored to local needs, as the private sector becomes more interested in social responsibility, our distinctiveness will be further called into question.</p> <p>Government no longer tolerates questions about its funding or consultation habits without asking what voluntary organisations intend to do to improve their practice on a range of issues: diversity; partnership working; implementation of quality standards; involvement of beneficiaries. We are no longer assumed to be a good thing because we are voluntary or charitable, we need to demonstrate good practice across a range of operational issues. In part this comes from a climate in which sector (or legal structure) does not matter, what matters is acceptable process, effectiveness and results.</p> <p>So how are we to respond to this environment? We should not assume that harking back to an era when the sector was less professional, less entrepreneurial will do us any good. To survive in the current climate and to secure the best possible services for beneficiaries we need to be both professional and entrepreneurial.</p> <p>However, we need to make sure we are clear about the sort of commercial decisions we take and how they relate or impact on our charitable mission. A small scale research project undertaken by NCVO with younger people demonstrated that they admire entrepreneurialism in the voluntary or charitable sector when it is directed to a good social end (and perhaps we might add when the activity does not undermine this end as has sometimes been the allegation in relation to some sponsorship deals).</p> <p>We need perhaps to think more critically about our contracting behaviour and how we relate to the statutory sector. For example, we as charities, if we are contracting with government for the provision of statutory services must be sure that the work falls within our mission and that costs are fully covered from the contract price. We need to ensure that charitable activity enhances or is additional to that provided by the state. While this is not technically a requirement of charity law, it is recommended practice by the charity commission in the interests of promoting public confidence in charitable giving.</p> <p>There has been a tendency in voluntary sector literature to simplify some of the issues at stake here. Some peddle the view that joint working between voluntary organisations and government is by its very nature corrosive, that it erodes independence. I would argue that there have never been watertight boundaries between the sectors and that joint working between the sector and government is to be encouraged where it is likely to provide a better service for beneficiaries. We operate in a complex and fast moving environment and old certainties around voluntary sector good, government and the private sector bad have been eroded.</p> <p>It is true that more joint working with government and more entrepreneurial or businesslike activity blurs the boundaries between the sectors so far as members of the public are concerned. However, we always need to keep in mind our independent and distinctive missions. We also need to build public understanding and awareness of the sector, how it works and and what it contributes. Many older people continue to have a very outdated view of who we are and how we operate.</p> <p>Charities and other voluntary organisations need to think carefully about where their organisation is most at risk of having its reputation challenged or undermined. This is not alarmism but simply a reality of modern life and one that most trustees or management committee members are fully aware of.</p> <p>This sort of challenge might take a variety of forms. It might relate to the ethical standards of an organisation, to standards of service provision or to operational policies and practices deemed not to be of the best.</p> <p>We need to share and learn from best practice on employment, diversity, consultation, user involvement, quality standards. We are if anything expected to have higher standards in these areas than organisations in the public and private sectors. Disappointment when we are shown wanting is therefore greater and more damaging to our reputations.</p> <p>I raised the issue of donors earlier - we also need to think carefully about our relationship with donors. Our research suggests that the information that we provide to the public is deemed inadequate. We might argue that there is a lot of it but perhaps it is the wrong information, in the wrong format. Again this is not an easy one to crack, many of you will say that marketing budgets are already overstretched. But perhaps it isn't about doing more but thinking more creatively about doing better.</p> <p>Our work suggests that greater clarity and transparency is needed. We also need to increase public awareness of some basic facts: <br>\u0095 That it costs money to raise money. <br>\u0095 That new, small organisations will of course be spending a larger proportion of their income on fundraising because of the need to develop an income base. And in turn that these organisations are important because they can provide more appropriate, sensitive services - the old plaint that there are too many charities is a basic misunderstanding. <br>\u0095 That it costs money to run services and that cheeseparing may simply result in poor services or worthwhile organisations going bust at great cost to beneficiaries.</p> <p>Statutory sector funders have a different take on it of course. However, increasingly they are asking questions about whether for example there is too little collaboration between voluntary organisations and therefore duplication and waste. They are asking whether we have become divorced from missions around exclusion and social justice, becoming organisations that simply chase whatever funding is available. Much of this is uninformed criticism of course but like all myths it has an element of truth.</p> <p>Are we as good at collaborating as we might be? Until relatively recently it could be argued we were encouraged to compete - many years of competitive bidding for funds and shortage of money saw to that. Nonetheless, I have heard people in the sector hark back to happier times in the 1970s and the 1980s when the strong in the sector were more inclined to share resources with the weak. Maybe this is rosy nostalgia but nonetheless perhaps some of us could be doing more to support other smaller, less experienced voluntary organisations.</p> <p>This isn't to say that the picture is bleak- of course it isn't - I am immensely proud of the sector and the contribution that it makes to society. I would not otherwise be doing the job that I do. In all the areas I have discussed particular organisations are developing and promoting excellent practice. But we should all look critically at ourselves and see if there are areas in which we might do even better.</p> <p>There are some sectoral initiatives which have been developed by NCVO and others to help support orgganisations tackle some of the issues I have identified - <br>\u0095 The Quality Standards Board <br>\u0095Projects on Diversity being developed by NCVO and ACEVO <br>\u0095 The Giving with Confidence project which is examining fundraising ethics and seeks to promote public trust and confidence. (ICFM, CAF, ACEVO and NCVO are involved in this.)</p> <p>Lets not be complacent - if we want to continue to grow in power and influence, able to do more and better for the people we were set up to serve than we can always to try to do a little better what we already do well.</p> <p>We have a lot to celebrate, we are now in an enviable position compared to say 15, 20 years ago but this means more pressure on us rather than less, expectations are sky high. This also means more scrutiny and we need to be prepared for this.</p>",

We should not assume that harking back to an era when the sector was less professional, less entrepreneurial will do us any good. To survive in the current climate and to secure the best possible services for beneficiaries we need to be both professional and entrepreneurial. However, we need to make sure we are clear about the sort of commercial decisions we take and how they relate or impact on our charitable mission. A small scale research project undertaken by NCVO with younger people demonstrated that they admire entrepreneurialism in the voluntary or charitable sector when it is directed to a good social end (and perhaps we might add when the activity does not undermine this end as has sometimes been the allegation in relation to some sponsorship deals). We need perhaps to think more critically about our contracting behaviour and how we relate to the statutory sector. For example, we as charities, if we are contracting with government for the provision of statutory services must be sure that the work falls within our mission and that costs are fully covered from the contract price. We need to ensure that charitable activity enhances or is additional to that provided by the state. While this is not technically a requirement of charity law, it is recommended practice by the charity commission in the interests of promoting public confidence in charitable giving. There has been a tendency in voluntary sector literature to simplify some of the issues at stake here. Some peddle the view that joint working between voluntary organisations and government is by its very nature corrosive, that it erodes independence. I would argue that there have never been watertight boundaries between the sectors and that joint working between the sector and government is to be encouraged where it is likely to provide a better service for beneficiaries. We operate in a complex and fast moving environment and old certainties around voluntary sector good, government and the private sector bad have been eroded. It is true that more joint working with government and more entrepreneurial or businesslike activity blurs the boundaries between the sectors so far as members of the public are concerned. However, we always need to keep in mind our independent and distinctive missions. We also need to build public understanding and awareness of the sector, how it works and and what it contributes. Many older people continue to have a very outdated view of who we are and how we operate. Charities and other voluntary organisations need to think carefully about where their organisation is most at risk of having its reputation challenged or undermined. This is not alarmism but simply a reality of modern life and one that most trustees or management committee members are fully aware of. This sort of challenge might take a variety of forms. It might relate to the ethical standards of an organisation, to standards of service provision or to operational policies and practices deemed not to be of the best. We need to share and learn from best practice on employment, diversity, consultation, user involvement, quality standards. We are if anything expected to have higher standards in these areas than organisations in the public and private sectors. Disappointment when we are shown wanting is therefore greater and more damaging to our reputations. I raised the issue of donors earlier - we also need to think carefully about our relationship with donors. Our research suggests that the information that we provide to the public is deemed inadequate. We might argue that there is a lot of it but perhaps it is the wrong information, in the wrong format. Again this is not an easy one to crack, many of you will say that marketing budgets are already overstretched. But perhaps it isn't about doing more but thinking more creatively about doing better. Our work suggests that greater clarity and transparency is needed. We also need to increase public awareness of some basic facts: \u0095 That it costs money to raise money. \u0095 That new, small organisations will of course be spending a larger proportion of their income on fundraising because of the need to develop an income base. And in turn that these organisations are important because they can provide more appropriate, sensitive services - the old plaint that there are too many charities is a basic misunderstanding. \u0095 That it costs money to run services and that cheeseparing may simply result in poor services or worthwhile organisations going bust at great cost to beneficiaries. Statutory sector funders have a different take on it of course. However, increasingly they are asking questions about whether for example there is too little collaboration between voluntary organisations and therefore duplication and waste. They are asking whether we have become divorced from missions around exclusion and social justice, becoming organisations that simply chase whatever funding is available. Much of this is uninformed criticism of course but like all myths it has an element of truth. Are we as good at collaborating as we might be? Until relatively recently it could be argued we were encouraged to compete - many years of competitive bidding for funds and shortage of money saw to that. Nonetheless, I have heard people in the sector hark back to happier times in the 1970s and the 1980s when the strong in the sector were more inclined to share resources with the weak. Maybe this is rosy nostalgia but nonetheless perhaps some of us could be doing more to support other smaller, less experienced voluntary organisations. This isn't to say that the picture is bleak- of course it isn't - I am immensely proud of the sector and the contribution that it makes to society. I would not otherwise be doing the job that I do. In all the areas I have discussed particular organisations are developing and promoting excellent practice. But we should all look critically at ourselves and see if there are areas in which we might do even better. There are some sectoral initiatives which have been developed by NCVO and others to help support orgganisations tackle some of the issues I have identified - \u0095 The Quality Standards Board \u0095Projects on Diversity being developed by NCVO and ACEVO \u0095 The Giving with Confidence project which is examining fundraising ethics and seeks to promote public trust and confidence. (ICFM, CAF, ACEVO and NCVO are involved in this.) Lets not be complacent - if we want to continue to grow in power and influence, able to do more and better for the people we were set up to serve than we can always to try to do a little better what we already do well. We have a lot to celebrate, we are now in an enviable position compared to say 15, 20 years ago but this means more pressure on us rather than less, expectations are sky high. This also means more scrutiny and we need to be prepared for this.",

Mr Kaufman, refusing to mince words, said Bectu was trying too hard to defend the status quo and suggested the union had become the \"defending council for the BBC\". He was speaking at the select committee hearings on the communications white paper during a representation from the union. Throughout the Bectu session Mr Kaufman was seen yawning and barely able to keep his eyes open. Bectu talked of an underfunded BBC that had a duty to fulfil its public service remit, and said it saw value in niche services. Mr Kaufman questioned the union's resolve to defend public service broadcasting. \"Why do we need to be, in 2001, that protective about public service broadcasting, especially when the BBC is not that het up about protecting it itself?\" he asked. Bectu maintained that public service broadcasting retained a central role in the future of British broadcasting. However, the union did call for a more accountable BBC and a tighter public service broadcasting remit. Bectu's submission to the committee was little more than a one-page series of bullet points, although Bectu president Tony Lennon did apologise for this, pointing out that the full submission was still being agreed upon internally.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is claiming a major coup with its deal for exclusive live coverage of Lennox Lewis's heavyweight boxing title fight against Hasim Rahman. \"At last the nation as a whole will see the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world return to our living rooms,\" said BBC controller of sport Peter Salmon. However, the contract does not cover what is expected to be the biggest box-office fight in Lewis's career - a bout with Mike Tyson. The BBC deal is thought to be worth up to \u00a31m per fight - a record for the corporation. \"It is not comparable to anything else,\" said Mr Salmon. Lewis's decision to switch to the BBC comes after a seven-year relationship with Sky Sports. However, it emerged today that the corporation did not launch a dawn raid on Sky, where interest in the boxer had waned. Mr Salmon said Lewis suggested the idea of a move himself, when they met at last year's TV Sports Personality of the Year awards. \"At the awards last year, Lennox challenged me to bring boxing back to the BBC,\" he said. BBC chiefs are touting the move as a major broadside against Sky and ITV. The rival broadcasters have left the BBC's sports department in tatters after a series of raids over the past five years. Last year, the corporation suffered its most crushing defeat with the loss of Premier League highlights to ITV. Before that, it lost their biggest its sports star - Des Lynam - to ITV. The corporation has also lost cricket, formula one and home Rugby Union matches. However, Mr Salmon was less certain of the prospects of securing rights to the fight between Lewis and Mike Tyson. That bout, if agreed, is likely to go to a satellite broadcaster because of the lucrative pay-per-view revenues that will be shared with the fighters and their promoters. But Mr Salmon remained in bullish mood. \"We've shown we can be competitive,\" he said. \"I realise the Tyson-Lewis fight is in a different league but strange things can happen in sport.\" The BBC will also televise Audley Harrison's first professional fight after his Olympic win on live TV last April. Mr Salmon, who was previously controller of BBC 1, was brought in by BBC director-general Greg Dyke who has made the recapture of valuable sports rights one of his key goals.

In the context of the explosive device being placed on KM180 at Luqa in a suitcase which must have had attached to it an interline tag to enable it to pass eventually on to PA103, these entries can easily be seen to have a sinister connotation, particularly in the complete absence of any form of explanation. </p> <p>\"While therefore there may well be a sinister inference to be drawn from the diary entries, we have come to the conclusion that there is insufficient other acceptable evidence to support or confirm such an inference, in particular an inference that the second accused was aware that any assistance he was giving to the first accused was in connection with a plan to destroy an aircraft by the planting of an explosive device.\"</p> <p> <b>Evidence against Abdelbaset Al Megrahi, found guilty</b><br> \"We are aware that in relation to certain aspects of the case there are a number of uncertainties and qualifications.

Bass-owned Carling, the league's existing sponsor, pulled out of negotiations to renew its deal two weeks ago, blaming \"protracted\" negotiations.

Mr Cain said Carling was already considering other ways of spending its \u00a330m marketing budget for the coming year. The company is to increase its spend on TV advertising along with greater investment in music sponsorship - it currently sponsors the Reading and Leeds music festivals and the NME Carling Awards.

But sports marketing sources believe Carling pulled out of the Premier League deal in order to drive the price down, and a return to the negotiating table could be imminent. Pepsi is also believed to be a hot contender for the sponsorship deal. It would also challenge arch-rival Coca-Cola, which is involved in football sponsorship.

      "body": "<p>While the commercial world is littered with dot.gones, the charity world still has reasons to be cheerful. Last week, the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) announced that it had raised \u00a31m through its websites. Next week, a new website is launched to help cut charity costs and another site has been launched as a precursor to a charity recruitment event in August.</p> <p>The CAF website had already brought in \u00a3700,000 before the umbrella organisation launched its All About Giving site four months ago, and has now netted a further \u00a3300,000 for charities. The new site explains how donors can give to charities in a tax-efficient way and allows charities to sign up even if they don't have their own website.</p> <p>Charities add themselves to the online database and sign up to accept donations through CAF's CharityCard and Give As You Earn scheme. </p> <p>The head of new media at CAF, Sarah Hughes, said: \"All About Giving enables donors to identify a particular charity, to learn more about its work and ultimately to make a donation. In turn, it allows charities to build close and more fruitful relationships with donors.\"</p> <p>Next Wednesday, charitybuyer goes live. It aims to be a one-stop shop detailing goods and services to the voluntary sector from telecoms to travel. The site allows users to exchange personal recommendations of good suppliers and give them a rating.</p> <p>Director of charitybuyer, Matthew Nimmo, said: \"Charity staff are always under pressure to get three quotes for every purchase. Now they can find out which suppliers are recommended by other charities. Over time we will put pressure on businesses to provide better deals.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, those who haven't achieved their new year's resolution of finding a job can click on to forum3, from February onwards, to search for a vacancy and learn about a charity recruitment event to be held in August this year. </p> <p>Hosted by Charity People, the recruitment fair will feature a keynote speaker, Meredith Belbin, who will talk about getting and keeping the right staff. Other seminars will cover career development, global opportunities and HR issues. If these are full, delegates will be able to attend \"virtual seminars\" through a cyber area.</p> <p>Charities with vacancies will be exhibiting at the event, so candidates can talk to potential employers, and some will be conducting interviews on the day.</p> <p>Whether its shopping, job hunting or giving - there is a site out there waiting for your clicks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "While the commercial world is littered with dot.gones, the charity world still has reasons to be cheerful. Last week, the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) announced that it had raised \u00a31m through its websites. Next week, a new website is launched to help cut charity costs and another site has been launched as a precursor to a charity recruitment event in August. The CAF website had already brought in \u00a3700,000 before the umbrella organisation launched its All About Giving site four months ago, and has now netted a further \u00a3300,000 for charities. The new site explains how donors can give to charities in a tax-efficient way and allows charities to sign up even if they don't have their own website. Charities add themselves to the online database and sign up to accept donations through CAF's CharityCard and Give As You Earn scheme. The head of new media at CAF, Sarah Hughes, said: \"All About Giving enables donors to identify a particular charity, to learn more about its work and ultimately to make a donation. In turn, it allows charities to build close and more fruitful relationships with donors.\" Next Wednesday, charitybuyer goes live. It aims to be a one-stop shop detailing goods and services to the voluntary sector from telecoms to travel. The site allows users to exchange personal recommendations of good suppliers and give them a rating. Director of charitybuyer, Matthew Nimmo, said: \"Charity staff are always under pressure to get three quotes for every purchase. Now they can find out which suppliers are recommended by other charities. Over time we will put pressure on businesses to provide better deals.\" Meanwhile, those who haven't achieved their new year's resolution of finding a job can click on to forum3, from February onwards, to search for a vacancy and learn about a charity recruitment event to be held in August this year. Hosted by Charity People, the recruitment fair will feature a keynote speaker, Meredith Belbin, who will talk about getting and keeping the right staff. Other seminars will cover career development, global opportunities and HR issues. If these are full, delegates will be able to attend \"virtual seminars\" through a cyber area. Charities with vacancies will be exhibiting at the event, so candidates can talk to potential employers, and some will be conducting interviews on the day. Whether its shopping, job hunting or giving - there is a site out there waiting for your clicks.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Myra Hindley</strong><br><strong> Age: 58</strong> </p> <p>Hindley was sentenced to 25 years in 1966 for her part, with Brady, in the murders of Downey and Kilbride. She later confessed to killing Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, 10. Successive home secretaries have ruled that she will end her days in prison, despite a number of legal challenges by Hindley. </p> <p> <strong> Malcolm Green </strong><br><strong>Age: 53</strong></p> <p>Given a life sentence in 1971 for killing a prostitute, and released after 18 years. Five months later, in 1990, he killed, apparently without motive, a tourist from New Zealand whom he had befriended. He dismembered the body and dumped it, wrapped in plastic bags, at several spots along a road in South Wales. He was jailed again in 1991. </p> <p> <strong> Archie Hall</strong><br><strong>Age: 78</strong></p> <p> Between 1977 and 1978 Hall killed the former MP Walter Scott-Elliott and his wife Dorothy, for whom he worked as a butler, two accomplices, who were also thought to be his lovers, and his half-brother. He is serving four life sentences, and is believed to be the oldest prisoner serving a \"natural life\" tariff. In 1995 he wrote to the Observer pleading for the right to die. </p> <p> <strong>Ian Brady</strong><br><strong>Age: 62</strong></p> <p>The Moors murderer was given two life sentences in 1966 for the murders of Lesley-Ann Downey, aged 10, John Kilbride, 12, and Edward Evans, 17. The body of 16-year-old Pauline Reade, another victim, was discovered on Saddleworth moor in 1987. Brady has spent more than a year on hunger strike demanding the right to die; judges ruled last year that authorities at Ashworth special hospital were right to force feed him to keep him alive. </p> <p> <strong>John Hilton</strong><br><strong>Age: 71</strong></p> <p>Hilton served a life sentence for murdering a man during a robbery at a south London shop in 1962. A month after his release on licence in 1978, he shot a diamond jeweller in the back during another robbery, and also accidentally shot his accomplice, who bled to death. He later confessed to the killings while in custody for another armed robbery. </p> <p> <strong>Jeremy Bamber</strong><br><strong>Age: 39</strong></p> <p>Given five life sentences in 1986 for shooting his adoptive parents, his sister and her twin sons in order to land a \u00a3500,000 inheritance. In 1995 he lost an appeal against the then home secretary Douglas Hurd's ruling that he should never be released. Earlier this month, it was announced that the criminal cases review commission, which investigates possible miscarriages of justice, will review his case. </p> <p> <strong>John Duffy</strong><br><strong>Age: 41</strong></p> <p>The so-called \"railway killer\" was given seven life terms in 1988 for two murders and three rapes between 1975 and 1986. He gained his nickname after stalking his victims to remote train stations before attacking them. In 1999 he admitted a further 17 sex offences. </p> <p> <strong>Dennis Nilsen</strong><br><strong>Age: 54</strong></p> <p> The civil servant was jailed for life in 1983 for six murders and two attempted murders, having killed and dismembered 15 gay men. He picked up rent boys and homeless men at gay clubs in Soho, strangling them and keeping the bodies in his bedroom, sometimes sketching them or having sex with the corpses. He was caught when the drains at his north London house became blocked with body parts. </p> <p> <strong>Victor Miller</strong><br><strong>Age: 45</strong></p> <p>A computer operator, he indecently assaulted and murdered a 14-year-old boy after abducting him on his paper round in Hagley, Worcestershire, in 1988. Police believe he may have carried out 28 further sexual assaults; it was after being arrested for another attack that Miller led police to the boy's battered body, hidden under a pile of leaves. The court heard that he preyed on paper boys because they were particularly vulnerable. Has asked to remain in prison for the rest of his life. </p> <p> <strong>Rosemary West</strong><br><strong>Age: 46</strong></p> <p>Given 10 life sentences in November 1995 for helping her husband Fred rape, torture and kill young women at their home in Gloucester. He had admitted to 12 murders, but hanged himself in prison while awaiting trial. Among the victims were West's daughter, Heather, her stepdaughter Charmaine, and a lodger pregnant by Fred West. </p> <p> <strong>Arthur Hutchinson</strong><br><strong>Age: 61</strong></p> <p>A petty criminal who also had a history of violence, Hutchinson gatecrashed a wedding reception at the home of a Sheffield solicitor in 1983. He stabbed to death the bride's mother, father and brother, before raping her sister at knifepoint. A palm print on a bottle of champagne helped lead police to him. He was jailed in 1984. </p> <p> <strong>Victor Castigador</strong><br><strong>Age: 46</strong></p> <p>An illegal immigrant who came to Britain from the Philippines in 1985, Castigador was jailed for life in 1990 for murdering two Sri Lankan security guards during a robbery at a Soho amusement arcade where he himself worked. Along with two other men, he tied up the guards and the female cashier, doused them in white spirit and locked them in a wire cage in the basement before tossing in lit matches. </p> <p> <strong>Colin Ireland</strong><br><strong>Age: 46</strong></p> <p>The ex-soldier pleaded guilty in 1993 to torturing and murdering five gay men he picked up in a pub in Kensington, west London. Psychiatrists declared him sane at his trial at the Old Bailey, and Ireland admitted he was a sadist. The court heard that he had made a new year's resolution to become a murderer, and continued until he felt he would qualify as a serial killer. </p> <p> <strong>Donald Neilson</strong><br><strong>Age: 60</strong></p> <p>Nicknamed the \"black panther\" because of his trademark balaclava, he shot dead three post office workers during robberies, and later kidnapped the 17-year-old heiress Lesley Whittle in an attempt to extort a ransom. Her body was later found in a drain in Staffordshire. Neilson was caught after two policemen spotted him acting suspiciously outside a pub in 1975. </p> <p>These men and women have received mandatory life sentences. The home secretary has the power to release them on licence at any time. But he is under no obligation to do so. Neither is he under any obligation to refer their cases to, or accept recommendations from, the parole board, the body that advises on the release of prisoners. These men and women are serving \"whole-life\" tariffs. It has been decided - by politicians - that life, in each of their cases, really does mean life. </p> <p>Even at this level, the whole-life tar iff seems remarkably unfair and open to abuse. It goes beyond the manipulation of approval ratings by vote-hungry governments, to the heart of our attitudes and the state of our nation. We exalt a number of this group of murderers as cultural icons and yet despise them intensely. We are faddish and jaded, and demand to be indulged. Michael Howard recognised this as an important aspect of the contract between the governing and the governed in our era when he introduced \"acceptability to the public\" as a criterion for release of life sentence prisoners. </p> <p>In the 1960s, there was a brief flowering of policies concerned with the rehabilitation and reform of criminals, but these were terminated abruptly by the Thatcherite approach to law and order: they did it, now they pay. The Thatcherite market philosophy has also had an impact on the relationship between society and the way that murder is viewed. There has been a privatisation of the act - victims, relatives and murderers have become commodities. The members of the latter group are the most easily tradeable and their names trip off our tongue like those of pop stars or football players. </p> <p>This objectification of murder has given rise to a pornography for which there is a seemingly unquenchable thirst. The ubiquitous \"true crime\" section in our bookshops, squeezed between the science fiction and horror shelves, is a testament to our overwhelming fascination with violence, sex and death. </p> <p>The indefinite life sentence stands as a symbol of the ossification of our thought. As far as we are concerned, the murderers are fixed for ever at the moment in which they killed their victims. </p> <p>Secretly (or not so secretly) we are relieved when the tabloids scream vengeance on our behalf. We allow ourselves to be convinced that we are not dealing with humans but with monsters. By weakly going along with this process, like proles attending an Orwellian Hate, we avoid ever having to consider the merit of each individual's development. Only by classifying them as faceless untermenschen can we justify this behaviour to ourselves. </p> <p>It is by no means to belittle the victims of their crimes to recognise the dignity of a human being. In fact it is difficult to think of a more appropriate response in the face of the taking of life. It is not an insult to their memory to recognise the potential within people for genuine change. This, like murder, is a function of the human condition. It is also understandable that victims' relatives should feel anger and a desire for vengeance. That is why they should not be given responsibility for determining the fate of the wrongdoer. </p> <p>It is not in dispute that those who are a danger to the public should be imprisoned; neither is the imposition of long prison sentences for serious crimes. What is wrong is the extinction of hope in those for whom it should still exist. </p> <p>The whole-life tariff demonstrates our wilful refusal to look at the real person and willingness instead to scream at the hideous shadow that he casts on the wall behind him. This denial of justice is as serious in its own way as the taking of life. It is how we treat the vulnerable, including murderers, that demonstrates the respect we have for ourselves and our strength as a society. </p> <p>The operation of this current sentencing practice is a tribute to the cynicism of our politicians and certain sections of the media. Their ability to create a climate of childlike, misinformed fear and emotional avarice is outstanding. We contribute to this state of affairs by devouring what we are offered without question. </p> <p>The demonisation of these men and women puts them on a pedestal they do not deserve to occupy. It is not that they are inhuman; rather it is that they have exhibited all too human behaviour, albeit in its most destructive form. We should acknowledge this. For their sake and ours, they should not be accorded mythic status. </p> <p>\u0095 Research by Esther Addley.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Myra Hindley Age: 58 Hindley was sentenced to 25 years in 1966 for her part, with Brady, in the murders of Downey and Kilbride. She later confessed to killing Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, 10. Successive home secretaries have ruled that she will end her days in prison, despite a number of legal challenges by Hindley. Malcolm Green Age: 53 Given a life sentence in 1971 for killing a prostitute, and released after 18 years. Five months later, in 1990, he killed, apparently without motive, a tourist from New Zealand whom he had befriended. He dismembered the body and dumped it, wrapped in plastic bags, at several spots along a road in South Wales. He was jailed again in 1991. Archie Hall Age: 78 Between 1977 and 1978 Hall killed the former MP Walter Scott-Elliott and his wife Dorothy, for whom he worked as a butler, two accomplices, who were also thought to be his lovers, and his half-brother. He is serving four life sentences, and is believed to be the oldest prisoner serving a \"natural life\" tariff. In 1995 he wrote to the Observer pleading for the right to die. Ian Brady Age: 62 The Moors murderer was given two life sentences in 1966 for the murders of Lesley-Ann Downey, aged 10, John Kilbride, 12, and Edward Evans, 17. The body of 16-year-old Pauline Reade, another victim, was discovered on Saddleworth moor in 1987. Brady has spent more than a year on hunger strike demanding the right to die; judges ruled last year that authorities at Ashworth special hospital were right to force feed him to keep him alive. John Hilton Age: 71 Hilton served a life sentence for murdering a man during a robbery at a south London shop in 1962. A month after his release on licence in 1978, he shot a diamond jeweller in the back during another robbery, and also accidentally shot his accomplice, who bled to death. He later confessed to the killings while in custody for another armed robbery. Jeremy Bamber Age: 39 Given five life sentences in 1986 for shooting his adoptive parents, his sister and her twin sons in order to land a \u00a3500,000 inheritance. In 1995 he lost an appeal against the then home secretary Douglas Hurd's ruling that he should never be released. Earlier this month, it was announced that the criminal cases review commission, which investigates possible miscarriages of justice, will review his case. John Duffy Age: 41 The so-called \"railway killer\" was given seven life terms in 1988 for two murders and three rapes between 1975 and 1986. He gained his nickname after stalking his victims to remote train stations before attacking them. In 1999 he admitted a further 17 sex offences. Dennis Nilsen Age: 54 The civil servant was jailed for life in 1983 for six murders and two attempted murders, having killed and dismembered 15 gay men. He picked up rent boys and homeless men at gay clubs in Soho, strangling them and keeping the bodies in his bedroom, sometimes sketching them or having sex with the corpses. He was caught when the drains at his north London house became blocked with body parts. Victor Miller Age: 45 A computer operator, he indecently assaulted and murdered a 14-year-old boy after abducting him on his paper round in Hagley, Worcestershire, in 1988. Police believe he may have carried out 28 further sexual assaults; it was after being arrested for another attack that Miller led police to the boy's battered body, hidden under a pile of leaves. The court heard that he preyed on paper boys because they were particularly vulnerable. Has asked to remain in prison for the rest of his life. Rosemary West Age: 46 Given 10 life sentences in November 1995 for helping her husband Fred rape, torture and kill young women at their home in Gloucester. He had admitted to 12 murders, but hanged himself in prison while awaiting trial. Among the victims were West's daughter, Heather, her stepdaughter Charmaine, and a lodger pregnant by Fred West. Arthur Hutchinson Age: 61 A petty criminal who also had a history of violence, Hutchinson gatecrashed a wedding reception at the home of a Sheffield solicitor in 1983. He stabbed to death the bride's mother, father and brother, before raping her sister at knifepoint. A palm print on a bottle of champagne helped lead police to him. He was jailed in 1984. Victor Castigador Age: 46 An illegal immigrant who came to Britain from the Philippines in 1985, Castigador was jailed for life in 1990 for murdering two Sri Lankan security guards during a robbery at a Soho amusement arcade where he himself worked. Along with two other men, he tied up the guards and the female cashier, doused them in white spirit and locked them in a wire cage in the basement before tossing in lit matches. Colin Ireland Age: 46 The ex-soldier pleaded guilty in 1993 to torturing and murdering five gay men he picked up in a pub in Kensington, west London. Psychiatrists declared him sane at his trial at the Old Bailey, and Ireland admitted he was a sadist. The court heard that he had made a new year's resolution to become a murderer, and continued until he felt he would qualify as a serial killer. Donald Neilson Age: 60 Nicknamed the \"black panther\" because of his trademark balaclava, he shot dead three post office workers during robberies, and later kidnapped the 17-year-old heiress Lesley Whittle in an attempt to extort a ransom. Her body was later found in a drain in Staffordshire. Neilson was caught after two policemen spotted him acting suspiciously outside a pub in 1975. These men and women have received mandatory life sentences. The home secretary has the power to release them on licence at any time. But he is under no obligation to do so. Neither is he under any obligation to refer their cases to, or accept recommendations from, the parole board, the body that advises on the release of prisoners. These men and women are serving \"whole-life\" tariffs. It has been decided - by politicians - that life, in each of their cases, really does mean life. Even at this level, the whole-life tar iff seems remarkably unfair and open to abuse. It goes beyond the manipulation of approval ratings by vote-hungry governments, to the heart of our attitudes and the state of our nation. We exalt a number of this group of murderers as cultural icons and yet despise them intensely. We are faddish and jaded, and demand to be indulged. Michael Howard recognised this as an important aspect of the contract between the governing and the governed in our era when he introduced \"acceptability to the public\" as a criterion for release of life sentence prisoners. In the 1960s, there was a brief flowering of policies concerned with the rehabilitation and reform of criminals, but these were terminated abruptly by the Thatcherite approach to law and order: they did it, now they pay. The Thatcherite market philosophy has also had an impact on the relationship between society and the way that murder is viewed. There has been a privatisation of the act - victims, relatives and murderers have become commodities. The members of the latter group are the most easily tradeable and their names trip off our tongue like those of pop stars or football players. This objectification of murder has given rise to a pornography for which there is a seemingly unquenchable thirst. The ubiquitous \"true crime\" section in our bookshops, squeezed between the science fiction and horror shelves, is a testament to our overwhelming fascination with violence, sex and death. The indefinite life sentence stands as a symbol of the ossification of our thought. As far as we are concerned, the murderers are fixed for ever at the moment in which they killed their victims. Secretly (or not so secretly) we are relieved when the tabloids scream vengeance on our behalf. We allow ourselves to be convinced that we are not dealing with humans but with monsters. By weakly going along with this process, like proles attending an Orwellian Hate, we avoid ever having to consider the merit of each individual's development. Only by classifying them as faceless untermenschen can we justify this behaviour to ourselves. It is by no means to belittle the victims of their crimes to recognise the dignity of a human being. In fact it is difficult to think of a more appropriate response in the face of the taking of life. It is not an insult to their memory to recognise the potential within people for genuine change. This, like murder, is a function of the human condition. It is also understandable that victims' relatives should feel anger and a desire for vengeance. That is why they should not be given responsibility for determining the fate of the wrongdoer. It is not in dispute that those who are a danger to the public should be imprisoned; neither is the imposition of long prison sentences for serious crimes. What is wrong is the extinction of hope in those for whom it should still exist. The whole-life tariff demonstrates our wilful refusal to look at the real person and willingness instead to scream at the hideous shadow that he casts on the wall behind him. This denial of justice is as serious in its own way as the taking of life. It is how we treat the vulnerable, including murderers, that demonstrates the respect we have for ourselves and our strength as a society. The operation of this current sentencing practice is a tribute to the cynicism of our politicians and certain sections of the media. Their ability to create a climate of childlike, misinformed fear and emotional avarice is outstanding. We contribute to this state of affairs by devouring what we are offered without question. The demonisation of these men and women puts them on a pedestal they do not deserve to occupy. It is not that they are inhuman; rather it is that they have exhibited all too human behaviour, albeit in its most destructive form. We should acknowledge this. For their sake and ours, they should not be accorded mythic status. \u0095 Research by Esther Addley.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The long Special Branch interrogation has left me numbed and disorientated. I search the court for friends but the looming faces belong to the police and the lawyers. The magistrate is saying something. Conspiracy charges, risk of flight, remand in custody. The hearing is over in seconds. Then it's a high-speed drive through parts of London I don't know. A long straight road, through some lights, then a right turn. A street sign says Jebb Avenue. The prison walls come into view and the gates open to swallow us. </p> <p>In reception I am stripped, measured, weighed and photographed. Reception smells of carbolic soap and soiled clothes - my clothes. I've been living in them for a week and they're stinking. They are exchanged for prison browns. The shirt collar is frayed, the trousers are stained and the grey woollen socks are damp from sweat that will never wash out. </p> <p>Passing through A wing with my escort, I see men in flip-flops and vests and baggy prison browns loiter at the top of the stairs. Others, towels slung over their shoulders, fill water jugs or empty piss-pots in the recess. Through half-open doors I glimpse the garish blur of pornographic collages - standard prison decor. We come to A seg, the special security unit, and go through a gate. An officer shouts after us, One on, and A seg has a new inmate. </p> <p>Set apart from the rest of the prison, A seg's compactness, fluorescent lighting and muffled sounds evoke the atmosphere of a hospital ward. A cleaner mops the floor, but everyone is locked up. I am taken to the fours and shown to a cell. It has an iron bed-frame concreted into the floor, a thin foam mattress, a chair and a fixed cupboard. In the far wall there is a radiator and, above it, a high, barred window. The door is pulled shut behind me. My first day as a remand prisoner in Brixton has begun. I sit on the bed and ask myself the question that dominates prisoners' lives: How long? How long am I going to be in here? And will I get through it? This was 20 years ago. </p> <p>Stephen Twinn is brisk, businesslike, assertive. On the wing they say he puts himself about, that he's not afraid to show who is boss. He is Brixton's new governor, is in his early 50s, wears a dickie bow and reads the Telegraph. We stand together on A wing fours and the prisoners crowd round us. </p> <p>What paper are you from? Write this down: say this is a third world prison. Say this is inhuman, it is degrading. Can you imagine what it is like to be locked up for days so you have to shit in front of another man you don't know? Smell my clothes, we didn't get showers today or yesterday. Write that down. One of the prisoners who has collared Mr Twinn says he is schizophrenic, psychopathic and suicidal, and he wants to be moved to a cell with his cousin. Another complains bitterly that there is no shampoo; another says his mail is being withheld, that he has got a new baby and he's waiting for the pictures. There are no library facilities and the phones haven't been turned on yet. Prison doesn't change anyone, the new father says, it just makes you more angry. </p> <p>The officer in charge of A wing says prisoners are more inadequate now than they used to be. He gets care in the community cases, shoplifters, the homeless, the chronically drug- and alcohol-dependent. Sixty per cent have been charged with drug-related offences. On Saturday, he received 15 new prisoners, 14 of whom the doctor put straight on the detox register. He should have 12 officers to control the wing. Today he has nine. </p> <p>When he hasn't the staff, he has to bang the men up. That is when they get angry, that is when they start mutilating themselves, killing themselves. Last year, the prisons minister Paul Boateng declared Brixton a \"failing prison\" and ordered that it be \"market tested\" - reviewed for possible privatisation. The old governor was moved out and Mr Twinn arrived to turn the place around. </p> <p>The men surrounding us have just been unlocked after 48 hours behind the door. They are brimming with anger. Mr Twinn thinks our presence is winding them up and that we should move on. I take a last look at A wing. A seg has gone. My old cell is indescribably filthy. The bedding should be burned. There is blood on the sheets. Some other stuff, too, but I don't want to look too closely. I tell Mr Twinn I can't believe how squalid the cell is. He says it doesn't look so bad to him. This is Brixton today. </p> <p>In my cell in A seg I can't imagine getting through the next 24 hours. I don't see how a life is possible. But wherever you are, whatever the conditions, you make a life; it's an irreducible human impulse. Letters and books arrive, newspapers, a radio, your own clothes. There's your family, though family can involve as much pain and guilt as comfort. There are visits and legal visits, there are your co-defendants. You nod cautiously to men on exercise and you start to make friends. </p> <p>In A seg they are armed robbers for the most part: very serious, professional men. These are the glory days of armed robbery, before grasses and technology get the upper hand; some of them have robbed millions of pounds in raids of commando daring. They are often big men who wear chunky gold jewellery and have blonde girlfriends. </p> <p>One night, a girlfriend is stabbed to death at the foot of a stairwell in a towerblock. The chaplain comes in to break the news to her lover. He disappears behind the door and I don't see him for a long time except when the medical orderly comes round with his tray of tranquillisers and he is at the cell door, knocking back whatever it is he needs to keep his life going. </p> <p>Sometimes I forget I am in prison. When I'm reading, when I'm playing football in the yard, when I'm playing cards with the robbers. When a letter filled with tenderness and news of friends transports me. But I don't forget for long. As the months go by, as summer fades and winter winds whistle through the wire, and more and more time is lost, that question, the prisoners' question, bears down: How long? What is my future to be? It tortures me in my sleep. It drives me mad and it makes me infantile. I take a deck of cards and before I cut I say, if it's red, I'm free. If it's black, it's prison. Black. OK. Two out of three. </p> <p>1979. My second summer in Brixton. A hot year. The cell is stifling. The conspiracy charge has been dropped, a different conspiracy substituted. I lie on the bed in my shorts and stare at the ceiling. Nothing now - not the letters, not the visits, not the new friends - can make this life bearable any more. The heat makes it worse. In the visiting room there are women with almost no clothes on. </p> <p>Mr Twinn wants to explain. Brixton is a large, crumbling, inner-city prison and it has very serious problems. With 750 inmates and capacity for 824, it is not, by official standards, overcrowded. There are some lifers in D wing, but most inmates are doing short sentences or awaiting trial, deportation or extradition. Some have been inside for 30 years or more, others arrived yesterday. </p> <p>There are 61 nationalities and more than half are from the ethnic minorities: Asian, Chinese, but mainly African or Afro-Caribbean. Many speak no English or speak English badly. There is racism, alcoholism, drug abuse and mental illness. Many of his staff are demoralised. In the old days, Brixton was the main remand prison for London and the south-east. It had 1,000 inmates and 1,000 staff to process them in and out of reception and escort them to and from their court appearances, everywhere from the Old Bailey to Chelmsford crown court. </p> <p>Keeping this complex machine running gave Brixton staff a certain cachet within the service. They lost that when Belmarsh was built and Brixton lost the courts. Staff levels were reduced by half. Notionally, Mr Twinn can count on having 70 officers on duty on weekdays. In practice, he rarely has more than 45. Some of his older officers haven't been able to make the adjustment. They go sick a lot. Everything comes down to staff numbers. When the numbers are low, the prisoners are locked up all day. Mr Twinn rotates the lock-up wing by wing so that at least one wing should be open on any given day. It is not ideal, but it is all he can do. Money is tight and it is getting tighter every year. </p> <p>In the health care centre a cheerful nurse talks about her discussion groups and art therapy groups. The centre is an obvious improvement on the old days when F wing, the hospital wing, was a byword for maltreatment and neglect. But still, in the dimly lit wards, men lie listless, with a terrible air of dejection and hopelessness about them. If you are in prison, do all you can not to fall sick. </p> <p>We turn into a short corridor. I suggest we move quickly through here, Mr Twinn says. These men are grossly mentally disturbed. A black man's eyes stare out through an observation flap in the steel door. We come to another block. At one cell door an armchair has been pulled right up to the flap. The cell's occupant is a boy who has repeatedly cut himself and is under 24-hour watch. Recently, he has been biting into his arm to rip his veins out with his teeth. The irreducible impulse to make a life, whatever the conditions, is sometimes not irreducible at all. </p> <p>I never came even close to this, but there was a point when the earth seemed to give way beneath my feet, when I seemed to be sinking slowly to the bottom of the sea and the air was being pressed from my lungs. I ask Mr Twinn if we can go to B seg, the punishment block. </p> <p>The robbers go for their trials and on the news it says they get 18 years and 22 years and life. Summer turns to autumn and the cold winds start again to whistle through the wire. I am on a conveyor belt like everyone else, just waiting my turn before the judges. I am tense and angry and frustrated. I bridle at rules I have until now managed to negotiate, and, inevitably, I end up in B seg. </p> <p>The punishment block now has only six cells in use, but 20 years ago it had double that. It was a busier and more brutal place then. The cells contained no furniture of any kind. At 8pm the door was unlocked and a bed and mattress placed inside. At 6am next morning, the bed was taken out. That left a piss-pot, a bucket, a water jug and a mug. There was nothing else. There were no books, no papers, no radio. The boredom was crushing. </p> <p>Mr Twinn arranges for me to observe the adjudication in progress. In the old days it was rough justice, aggressively administered. I never heard of anyone getting a not guilty at an adjudication. After my second adjudication, I refused to participate and simply stayed in my cell to be tried in my absence. </p> <p>Today, I am looking at a small, pale, wasted man, a little confused, a hint of slurred speech. He pleads not guilty to throwing his steel tray on the floor but accepts he did what they say he did. He says when he got to the food queue there was only one fishfinger left. Yes, sir, he threw his tray down but he was hungry, sir, and his brother had recently drowned and he is depressed and having bad dreams. He is let off with a caution. When he is gone, the assistant governor turns to me and says he needs help and they'll do what they can to get it to him. </p> <p>Perhaps they will. Perhaps Mr Twinn's energy and leadership will make Brixton a safer, more humane establishment. He has already achieved some obvious improvements and relationships between inmates and staff have clearly eased, helped in no small measure by the recruitment of black and female prison officers. But Brixton to me looks worse now than it was when I was there. Nastier, more squalid, more chaotic. What's your answer?, Mr Twinn challenges me. It is a challenge for us all. </p> <p>I go to stand in one of the cells I occupied in the block during my last stay here. In my case, the question, how long?, was met with the answer: no longer. The card I cut turned out to be red. I did not know this when I was in this cell. </p> <p>No one who knows me would say I am a sentimental man, but standing here a memory floods back that leaves me momentarily trembling. It was when the board of visitors made one of their occasional inspections. The door opened and a man in a tweed suit and with the plummiest of accents said, Any complaints?

      "bodyText": "The long Special Branch interrogation has left me numbed and disorientated. I search the court for friends but the looming faces belong to the police and the lawyers. The magistrate is saying something. Conspiracy charges, risk of flight, remand in custody. The hearing is over in seconds. Then it's a high-speed drive through parts of London I don't know. A long straight road, through some lights, then a right turn. A street sign says Jebb Avenue. The prison walls come into view and the gates open to swallow us. In reception I am stripped, measured, weighed and photographed. Reception smells of carbolic soap and soiled clothes - my clothes. I've been living in them for a week and they're stinking. They are exchanged for prison browns. The shirt collar is frayed, the trousers are stained and the grey woollen socks are damp from sweat that will never wash out. Passing through A wing with my escort, I see men in flip-flops and vests and baggy prison browns loiter at the top of the stairs. Others, towels slung over their shoulders, fill water jugs or empty piss-pots in the recess. Through half-open doors I glimpse the garish blur of pornographic collages - standard prison decor. We come to A seg, the special security unit, and go through a gate. An officer shouts after us, One on, and A seg has a new inmate. Set apart from the rest of the prison, A seg's compactness, fluorescent lighting and muffled sounds evoke the atmosphere of a hospital ward. A cleaner mops the floor, but everyone is locked up. I am taken to the fours and shown to a cell. It has an iron bed-frame concreted into the floor, a thin foam mattress, a chair and a fixed cupboard. In the far wall there is a radiator and, above it, a high, barred window. The door is pulled shut behind me. My first day as a remand prisoner in Brixton has begun. I sit on the bed and ask myself the question that dominates prisoners' lives: How long? How long am I going to be in here? And will I get through it? This was 20 years ago. Stephen Twinn is brisk, businesslike, assertive. On the wing they say he puts himself about, that he's not afraid to show who is boss. He is Brixton's new governor, is in his early 50s, wears a dickie bow and reads the Telegraph. We stand together on A wing fours and the prisoners crowd round us. What paper are you from? Write this down: say this is a third world prison. Say this is inhuman, it is degrading. Can you imagine what it is like to be locked up for days so you have to shit in front of another man you don't know? Smell my clothes, we didn't get showers today or yesterday. Write that down. One of the prisoners who has collared Mr Twinn says he is schizophrenic, psychopathic and suicidal, and he wants to be moved to a cell with his cousin. Another complains bitterly that there is no shampoo; another says his mail is being withheld, that he has got a new baby and he's waiting for the pictures. There are no library facilities and the phones haven't been turned on yet. Prison doesn't change anyone, the new father says, it just makes you more angry. The officer in charge of A wing says prisoners are more inadequate now than they used to be. He gets care in the community cases, shoplifters, the homeless, the chronically drug- and alcohol-dependent. Sixty per cent have been charged with drug-related offences. On Saturday, he received 15 new prisoners, 14 of whom the doctor put straight on the detox register. He should have 12 officers to control the wing. Today he has nine. When he hasn't the staff, he has to bang the men up. That is when they get angry, that is when they start mutilating themselves, killing themselves. Last year, the prisons minister Paul Boateng declared Brixton a \"failing prison\" and ordered that it be \"market tested\" - reviewed for possible privatisation. The old governor was moved out and Mr Twinn arrived to turn the place around. The men surrounding us have just been unlocked after 48 hours behind the door. They are brimming with anger. Mr Twinn thinks our presence is winding them up and that we should move on. I take a last look at A wing. A seg has gone. My old cell is indescribably filthy. The bedding should be burned. There is blood on the sheets. Some other stuff, too, but I don't want to look too closely. I tell Mr Twinn I can't believe how squalid the cell is. He says it doesn't look so bad to him. This is Brixton today. In my cell in A seg I can't imagine getting through the next 24 hours. I don't see how a life is possible. But wherever you are, whatever the conditions, you make a life; it's an irreducible human impulse. Letters and books arrive, newspapers, a radio, your own clothes. There's your family, though family can involve as much pain and guilt as comfort. There are visits and legal visits, there are your co-defendants. You nod cautiously to men on exercise and you start to make friends. In A seg they are armed robbers for the most part: very serious, professional men. These are the glory days of armed robbery, before grasses and technology get the upper hand; some of them have robbed millions of pounds in raids of commando daring. They are often big men who wear chunky gold jewellery and have blonde girlfriends. One night, a girlfriend is stabbed to death at the foot of a stairwell in a towerblock. The chaplain comes in to break the news to her lover. He disappears behind the door and I don't see him for a long time except when the medical orderly comes round with his tray of tranquillisers and he is at the cell door, knocking back whatever it is he needs to keep his life going. Sometimes I forget I am in prison. When I'm reading, when I'm playing football in the yard, when I'm playing cards with the robbers. When a letter filled with tenderness and news of friends transports me. But I don't forget for long. As the months go by, as summer fades and winter winds whistle through the wire, and more and more time is lost, that question, the prisoners' question, bears down: How long? What is my future to be? It tortures me in my sleep. It drives me mad and it makes me infantile. I take a deck of cards and before I cut I say, if it's red, I'm free. If it's black, it's prison. Black. OK. Two out of three. 1979. My second summer in Brixton. A hot year. The cell is stifling. The conspiracy charge has been dropped, a different conspiracy substituted. I lie on the bed in my shorts and stare at the ceiling. Nothing now - not the letters, not the visits, not the new friends - can make this life bearable any more. The heat makes it worse. In the visiting room there are women with almost no clothes on. Mr Twinn wants to explain. Brixton is a large, crumbling, inner-city prison and it has very serious problems. With 750 inmates and capacity for 824, it is not, by official standards, overcrowded. There are some lifers in D wing, but most inmates are doing short sentences or awaiting trial, deportation or extradition. Some have been inside for 30 years or more, others arrived yesterday. There are 61 nationalities and more than half are from the ethnic minorities: Asian, Chinese, but mainly African or Afro-Caribbean. Many speak no English or speak English badly. There is racism, alcoholism, drug abuse and mental illness. Many of his staff are demoralised. In the old days, Brixton was the main remand prison for London and the south-east. It had 1,000 inmates and 1,000 staff to process them in and out of reception and escort them to and from their court appearances, everywhere from the Old Bailey to Chelmsford crown court. Keeping this complex machine running gave Brixton staff a certain cachet within the service. They lost that when Belmarsh was built and Brixton lost the courts. Staff levels were reduced by half. Notionally, Mr Twinn can count on having 70 officers on duty on weekdays. In practice, he rarely has more than 45. Some of his older officers haven't been able to make the adjustment. They go sick a lot. Everything comes down to staff numbers. When the numbers are low, the prisoners are locked up all day. Mr Twinn rotates the lock-up wing by wing so that at least one wing should be open on any given day. It is not ideal, but it is all he can do. Money is tight and it is getting tighter every year. In the health care centre a cheerful nurse talks about her discussion groups and art therapy groups. The centre is an obvious improvement on the old days when F wing, the hospital wing, was a byword for maltreatment and neglect. But still, in the dimly lit wards, men lie listless, with a terrible air of dejection and hopelessness about them. If you are in prison, do all you can not to fall sick. We turn into a short corridor. I suggest we move quickly through here, Mr Twinn says. These men are grossly mentally disturbed. A black man's eyes stare out through an observation flap in the steel door. We come to another block. At one cell door an armchair has been pulled right up to the flap. The cell's occupant is a boy who has repeatedly cut himself and is under 24-hour watch. Recently, he has been biting into his arm to rip his veins out with his teeth. The irreducible impulse to make a life, whatever the conditions, is sometimes not irreducible at all. I never came even close to this, but there was a point when the earth seemed to give way beneath my feet, when I seemed to be sinking slowly to the bottom of the sea and the air was being pressed from my lungs. I ask Mr Twinn if we can go to B seg, the punishment block. The robbers go for their trials and on the news it says they get 18 years and 22 years and life. Summer turns to autumn and the cold winds start again to whistle through the wire. I am on a conveyor belt like everyone else, just waiting my turn before the judges. I am tense and angry and frustrated. I bridle at rules I have until now managed to negotiate, and, inevitably, I end up in B seg. The punishment block now has only six cells in use, but 20 years ago it had double that. It was a busier and more brutal place then. The cells contained no furniture of any kind. At 8pm the door was unlocked and a bed and mattress placed inside. At 6am next morning, the bed was taken out. That left a piss-pot, a bucket, a water jug and a mug. There was nothing else. There were no books, no papers, no radio. The boredom was crushing. Mr Twinn arranges for me to observe the adjudication in progress. In the old days it was rough justice, aggressively administered. I never heard of anyone getting a not guilty at an adjudication. After my second adjudication, I refused to participate and simply stayed in my cell to be tried in my absence. Today, I am looking at a small, pale, wasted man, a little confused, a hint of slurred speech. He pleads not guilty to throwing his steel tray on the floor but accepts he did what they say he did. He says when he got to the food queue there was only one fishfinger left. Yes, sir, he threw his tray down but he was hungry, sir, and his brother had recently drowned and he is depressed and having bad dreams. He is let off with a caution. When he is gone, the assistant governor turns to me and says he needs help and they'll do what they can to get it to him. Perhaps they will. Perhaps Mr Twinn's energy and leadership will make Brixton a safer, more humane establishment. He has already achieved some obvious improvements and relationships between inmates and staff have clearly eased, helped in no small measure by the recruitment of black and female prison officers. But Brixton to me looks worse now than it was when I was there. Nastier, more squalid, more chaotic. What's your answer?, Mr Twinn challenges me. It is a challenge for us all. I go to stand in one of the cells I occupied in the block during my last stay here. In my case, the question, how long?, was met with the answer: no longer. The card I cut turned out to be red. I did not know this when I was in this cell. No one who knows me would say I am a sentimental man, but standing here a memory floods back that leaves me momentarily trembling. It was when the board of visitors made one of their occasional inspections. The door opened and a man in a tweed suit and with the plummiest of accents said, Any complaints? I was sitting on the floor of a bare cell and I hadn't spoken to anyone for a week. I was too stunned to answer and before I got a word out the door had closed. They opened up my neighbour and I heard him shout, Any fucking complaints? Are you kidding? I heard the prison officers move in and restrain him. The last I heard was him shouting, half strangled, but resonant with outrage, I wouldn't keep a dog like this. Mr Twinn asks if I've seen enough here and I say that I have. \u0095 Ronan Bennett's first novel was The Second Prison, published by Review \u00a36.99.",

      "bodyText": "Two weeks before the blast which tore apart the Pan Am 103 plane over Lockerbie, Abdelbaset Al Megrahi walked into the Mary's House clothes store in Malta's seaside suburb of Sliema. Paying little attention to what he was buying, he placed a sky-blue baby romper suit, an umbrella and some adult clothes on the counter, paid and promptly left the store. The shop's owner, Tony Gauci, had no idea that the clothes would be used to pack the suitcase which would also contain the devastating bomb. Megrahi, who returned to Tripoli after buying the clothes, helped to construct a bomb using an army-style timer similar to one supplied to the Libyan forces by a Swiss firm. Explosives were packed into a radio cassette player and the bomb was then placed in a brown Samsonite-style suitcase. The night before the bomb was placed on the plane, Megrahi checked into Malta's salubrious Crowne Plaza hotel, using the false name Ahmed Khalifa Abdusamad. The suitcase containing the bomb was then smuggled aboard an Air Malta flight to the German city of Frankfurt. Stolen Air Malta luggage tags were used to ensure that the suitcase was then transferred straight onto the Pan Am flight, which was travelling from Frankfurt to New York via Heathrow. Police investigating the blast traced charred shards of a sky blue baby romper suit, umbrella and adult clothes found in the plane's wreckage to Mr Gauci's small family-run shop. The prosecution had alleged that Megrahi had an accomplice - Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah - who had kept a cache of TNT in a desk drawer at Malta airport, and had driven Megrahi to his hotel from Malta's Luqa airport when he flew in from Tripoli.

His is just one of the success stories of the pilot project, which showed the positive impact volunteering can have on people recovering from drug and alcohol abuse. </p> <p>The project also showed the benefits that can flow from voluntary sector partnerships - even though the scheme brought together two charities which had very little in common. </p> <p>A new evaluation of the scheme, which ran from 1997 to 1999, shows that former addicts gained hugely in self-confidence after going on environmental expeditions. The field trips contributed to a 95% reduction in crimes committed after discharge from the Ley Community. </p> <p>The evaluation report highlights comments from volunteers about the field trips. One says: \"The scientific side was demystified, as we learned about the processes involved, but, more importantly, social barriers were broken down. I thought I'd feel inferior to 'professional people', but that was blown away from day one. We were all on a level as human beings, sharing a common task.\" </p> <p>The volunteers were recovering drug and alcohol abusers, spending between 12 and 14 months on a therapeutic programme as residents of the Ley Community, near Oxford. In the latter stages, they are encouraged to undertake voluntary work in the local community as part of their preparation for the world of work. </p> <p>The Ley Community already had links with Earthwatch, enabling residents to work in its office. But under the pilot scheme, funded by the NatWest Charitable Trust, the volunteers were also allowed on two-week, post-doctoral scientific field trips. These included a study of dinosaur footprints in north Yorkshire and a survey of birds of prey on Mull. \"We must credit Earthwatch with being brave enough to take these former addicts on their field trips,\" says Ley Community chief executive Paul Goodman. </p> <p>The residents went on the trips in pairs, accompanied by a Ley Community staff member as mentor in the first year. Owing to staff shortages the following year, volunteers from the first year returned to act as mentors. This arrangement worked so well that it was continued in the final year. </p> <p>On the trips, the Ley Community residents mixed with academics, overseas students and others, some of whom had paid \u00a31,000 to go on the expedition. Trips were followed by one to two weeks of debriefing at Earthwatch, which combined office work with preparing a presentation on the trip to charity staff. </p> <p>Goodman says a key part of the community's approach to rehabilitation is building up residents' sense of self-esteem and self-confidence. \"That's where the Earthwatch project was very successful as you had these young, former addicts put into an environment with a range of academics, students and others, and being treated normally.\" </p> <p>McCabe agrees: \"Earthwatch made an effort to involve the volunteers in what was going on, and the experience of mixing with the other participants and the natural beauty around made it a very powerful experience.\" Before the field trip, time spent at Earthwatch's offices also helped him reintegrate into the outside world. \"Working with staff directly broke down a lot of the preconceptions I'd had about 'boring office workers'.\" </p> <p>Thirty-six Ley Community residents took part in the project over three years. According to the evaluation, 65% of those taking part said their self-confidence improved as a result and 78% reported the experience as good or positive. </p> <p>Goodman says using volunteering as part of a structured rehabilitation programme can provide immense benefits in raising the self-esteem of former addicts and reducing re-offending rates. \"All our residents do some form of volunteering as part of the therapeutic programme and it's a very important element, because most of these people are very apprehensive about returning to the world of work. Volunteering can help ease them back into the outside world.\" </p> <p>Earthwatch chief executive Robert Barrington, who is seeking funding to revive field trip volunteering, admits the approach had its risks. \"At first it seemed unrealistic to ask people still undergoing rehabilitation, and who often had limited educational qualifications, to take part in a post-doctoral scientific expedition alongside volunteers from all over the world who have paid up to \u00a31,000 for the privilege,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I am delighted that these fears proved groundless and that the scheme has been a success from every perspective.\" </p> <p>Copies of the evaluation report are available free from Earthwatch on 01865-318800.</p>",

By 1999, when the population had grown to 52.69m, 83,600 legacies were received. </p> <p>It is impossible to put a precise value on the income received because we do not know the value of each residuary legacy - ie the share or percentage of estates left to charity. But we currently estimate it to be around \u00a31.2bn - four times as much as the income received by charities from the corporate sector. </p> <p>Our research over the same period shows intestacy, dying without a will, has dropped from 24.6% to 17.1%.

      "bodyText": "The government will press for hundreds of millions of pounds' compensation from Libya for the families of those killed in the Lockerbie airliner bombing. Prime minister Tony Blair's spokesman told reporters that the conviction of a Libyan man for the bombing \"confirms our longstanding suspicion that Libyan officials instigated the Lockerbie bombing\". \"We expect the Libyan authorities to take full responsibility for the actions of their officials,\" the spokesman said. \"We also expect them to pay compensation as awarded by the courts.\" The White House said the verdict was \"a victory for an international effort\" but said it did \"not in itself signify an end to UN sanctions against Libya.\" Officials said they would consult Britain about the remaining steps Libya must take before UN sanctions could be removed. The American courts have already awarded $700m [\u00a3466m] in compensation to the victims' relatives, the minimum Libya will be asked to pay. Sources say there has already been some diplomatic discussion with Libya and Britain's renewed ties with the country would not be affected by today's verdict, which points to some official involvement. \"Relations were re-established two years ago with the clear knowledge that this could be an outcome,\" said Fred Halliday of the London School of Economics. \"There may be a limited short-term outcome, especially if there is lots of American pressure... to go slow on some contacts. But it won't be overt,\" he said. A Foreign Office spokesman said that meetings would now take place with the Libyan authorities to determine whether the country has complied with the conditions for the lifting of UN sanctions. No timetable has been set for a decision on whether sanctions will or will not be lifted, he said. Under UN resolutions, sanctions can be lifted when Libya ceases all forms of terrorism, hands over the two suspects for trial, discloses all it knows about the Lockerbie bombing, accepts responsibility for the actions of Libyan officials, pays appropriate compensation; and co-operates with the French investigation into the 1989 bombing of a UTA passenger aeroplane over Niger, in west Africa. The Foreign Office spokesman said: \"Our sympathy is with the Lockerbie families. Nothing can repair their loss. \"There has now been a fair trial, conducted with thoroughness and dignity under Scottish law and in accordance with UN resolutions. That was always the aim of our policy, whatever the outcome.\" \"We must now reflect on the verdict, study the reasoned judgment carefully and assess whether Libya has complied with the will of the international community, as laid down in UN resolutions. He continued: \"Libya must comply with all these requirements before sanctions can be lifted. As a first step, we will be talking to the Libyan authorities about their response to the requirements in the light of the verdict.\" The UK cut relations with president Muammar Gadafy in 1984 after the shooting of a policewoman outside the Libyan embassy in London. Relations were further soured by the Lady Thatcher's controversial decision to allow a US airstrike on Libya launch from British airforce bases in 1986. Diplomatic relations were restored in 1999 after Libya agreed to pay compensation to the family of PC Yvonne Fletcher Relations with the US are virtually non-existent and today's verdict is not expected to change American's attitude. US Secretary of State Colin Powell said Tuesday that regardless of the verdict: \"There are other things that the Libyan government will be expected to do; regarding the UN sanctions. \"It would also be important to note that there are US sanctions that predate the UN sanctions that were not affected by the outcome of this trial,\" Powell said.

All 259 passengers and crew die instantly, along with 11 people on the ground. July 1990 The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch concludes that the crash was the result of \"the detonation of an improvised explosive device located in a baggage container\". November 1991 Two Libyans, Abdelbaset Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, are charged with the Lockerbie bombing in the US and in Scotland. Two weeks later, the US, British and French governments demand that the Libyan Government give up the suspects for trial in their courts. December 1991 Libya insists it will try the men in its own courts. March 1992 After a United Nations order to surrender the Lockerbie suspects goes unheeded, the UN impose sanctions on Libya. Air travel and arms sales to Libya are banned. September 1993 Ibrahim Legwell, the Libyan lawyer for the two suspects, says that they would be willing to stand trial in Switzerland, but Britain and the US continue to insist that the two suspects must face trial either in the Scotland or America.

October 1997 Nelson Mandela asks Britain and the US to accept a trial in a neutral state after meeting Jim Swire, the father of a victim. December 1997 A month after Libya announces it does not believe its citizens would receive a fair trial in Britain (although it does not object to Scottish law or Scottish judges) a UN report says that the Libyan suspects would receive a fair trial in Scotland.

      "body": "<b>Who was on trial, and why? </b> <br> Abdelbaset Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah were accused of planting the bomb which destroyed Pan Am flight 103 over southern Scotland on December 21 1988. When Boeing 747 disintegrated, giant chunks of debris smashed into the little town of Lockerbie. All 259 passengers and crew on the aircraft died, along with 11 people on the ground. <p><b>Why would Libyans want to destroy an American civilian flight? </b><br> Prosecution lawyers claimed that the defendants were both agents of Libyan intelligence, serving official policy. Colonel Muammar Gadafy, the Libyan ruler, has always been virulently anti-western, never more so than in the aftermath of the 1986 bombing of Tripoli by US warplanes flying from British bases. The colonel's adopted daughter was among those killed in the raid. </p> <p><b>Any other theories? </b><br> Dozens. According to one paranoid school of thought, the bomb was planted by a renegade faction of America's own intelligence community, which wanted to eliminate a potential whistleblower who was travelling on the doomed jumbo. Other, slightly less extravagant, theories involve Palestinian militant groups and the regimes in Syria and Iran. </p> <p><b>What did the defence say? </b><br> They said the bombing was carried out by the extreme militant faction, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC), with help from the governments of Syria and Iran. Al Megrahi and Fhimah both pleaded not guilty. </p> <p><b>Why did it take so long to get them in the dock? </b><br> At the start, the main delay was the huge forensic task of establishing the cause of the explosion. The aircraft burst into more than four million bits, and by sifting through the sad and grisly remains, investigators concluded that the bomb had exploded in a suitcase in the plane's baggage hold. In 1991, a Scottish judge ruled that the suitcase had been loaded on to a Pan Am connecting flight in Malta by the two Libyans. Warrants were then issued for their arrest. </p> <p><b>Did they give themselves up quietly? </b><br> Far from it. It took eight years of painstaking diplomatic effort to extract them from Libya. In the end it was achieved only after the personal intervention of UN secretary general Kofi Annan and the then South African president, Nelson Mandela. </p> <p><b>Why was the trial held in the Netherlands? </b><br> From the outset, Britain and the USA argued that the crime was committed in Scottish airspace, and should therefore be pursued in Scottish law. However, Gadafy claimed that the two suspects could not get a fair trial in Britain. Hence the tortuous compromise: the trial was held in a neutral country, but under Scottish law with a panel of three Scottish judges. The court, at the former airbase of Camp Zeist, is technically and temporarily Scottish territory. </p> <p><b>What about the victims' families? </b><br> For 12 years, they have pleaded and campaigned for full disclosure of all the facts behind the outrage. Some, like Scottish doctor Jim Swire, have devoted their lives to that campaign, and have followed the trial in minute detail. Some of the American victims' families claim that the trial is a sideshow. They want senior members of the Libyan regime to face charges. That won't happen. According to some of the families, the sealed letter sent by Kofi Annan to Col Gadafy to secure the handover of the two men contained a promise that the Libyan leader would never be prosecuted. </p> <p><b>Is today's verdict the end of the matter? </b><br> Hardly. Some of the victims' relatives have sworn to pursue their own civil action against the accused. Conspiracy theories will continue to swirl. Lockerbie will still bear its scars. </p> <p> <b>The verdict</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/guardian/pdf/0131lockerbieverdict.pdf\" target=\"_new\">Full text of the judges' verdict (pdf file)</a><br> You will need Adobe Acrobat to view this file.

      "bodyText": "Who was on trial, and why? Abdelbaset Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah were accused of planting the bomb which destroyed Pan Am flight 103 over southern Scotland on December 21 1988. When Boeing 747 disintegrated, giant chunks of debris smashed into the little town of Lockerbie. All 259 passengers and crew on the aircraft died, along with 11 people on the ground. Why would Libyans want to destroy an American civilian flight? Prosecution lawyers claimed that the defendants were both agents of Libyan intelligence, serving official policy. Colonel Muammar Gadafy, the Libyan ruler, has always been virulently anti-western, never more so than in the aftermath of the 1986 bombing of Tripoli by US warplanes flying from British bases. The colonel's adopted daughter was among those killed in the raid. Any other theories? Dozens. According to one paranoid school of thought, the bomb was planted by a renegade faction of America's own intelligence community, which wanted to eliminate a potential whistleblower who was travelling on the doomed jumbo. Other, slightly less extravagant, theories involve Palestinian militant groups and the regimes in Syria and Iran. What did the defence say? They said the bombing was carried out by the extreme militant faction, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC), with help from the governments of Syria and Iran. Al Megrahi and Fhimah both pleaded not guilty. Why did it take so long to get them in the dock? At the start, the main delay was the huge forensic task of establishing the cause of the explosion. The aircraft burst into more than four million bits, and by sifting through the sad and grisly remains, investigators concluded that the bomb had exploded in a suitcase in the plane's baggage hold. In 1991, a Scottish judge ruled that the suitcase had been loaded on to a Pan Am connecting flight in Malta by the two Libyans. Warrants were then issued for their arrest. Did they give themselves up quietly? Far from it. It took eight years of painstaking diplomatic effort to extract them from Libya. In the end it was achieved only after the personal intervention of UN secretary general Kofi Annan and the then South African president, Nelson Mandela. Why was the trial held in the Netherlands? From the outset, Britain and the USA argued that the crime was committed in Scottish airspace, and should therefore be pursued in Scottish law. However, Gadafy claimed that the two suspects could not get a fair trial in Britain. Hence the tortuous compromise: the trial was held in a neutral country, but under Scottish law with a panel of three Scottish judges. The court, at the former airbase of Camp Zeist, is technically and temporarily Scottish territory. What about the victims' families? For 12 years, they have pleaded and campaigned for full disclosure of all the facts behind the outrage. Some, like Scottish doctor Jim Swire, have devoted their lives to that campaign, and have followed the trial in minute detail. Some of the American victims' families claim that the trial is a sideshow. They want senior members of the Libyan regime to face charges. That won't happen. According to some of the families, the sealed letter sent by Kofi Annan to Col Gadafy to secure the handover of the two men contained a promise that the Libyan leader would never be prosecuted. Is today's verdict the end of the matter? Hardly. Some of the victims' relatives have sworn to pursue their own civil action against the accused. Conspiracy theories will continue to swirl.

      "bodyText": "The spokesman for the families of those killed in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing collapsed in court shortly after the verdict was read. Dr Jim Swire, who lost his daughter on Pan Am flight 103, has been the leading campaigner in the 12 year battle to bring the perpetrators to justice. The 64-year-old retired British physician fainted 15 minutes after the verdict was announced and was carried out by other relatives, his body limp and motionless. His relentless campaign has been all-consuming and he has attended nearly every session of the trial. Earlier Dr Swire said that the British relatives will seek a public inquiry on how the British government and intelligence services handled the Lockerbie affair. \"There are many unanswered questions about who ordered this vile act and why our relatives were not protected,\" he said. After the reading of the verdict, a hush descended on the court as the clerk recorded the verdict, but there was no immediate word of the reaction in the crowded public gallery. The three judges and alternate remained silent as the clerk wrote. Dozens of relatives from the United States and Britain were in the courtroom, as well as several relatives of the two defendants. Dr Swire's wife, Jane, who did not attend the trial at Camp Zeist, said she had spoken to her husband and that he was not seriously ill. She said: \"I have spoken to him and he's okay. I think he got to court without eating anything properly and his blood sugar levels must have been too low. Coupled with the emotion of it all, it's taken its toll.

      "body": "<b> Myra Hindley</b> <br> <b> Age: 58</b> <p>Hindley was sentenced to 25 years in 1966 for her part, with Brady, in the murders of Downey and Kilbride. She later confessed to killing Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, 10. Successive home secretaries have ruled that she will end her days in prison, despite a number of legal challenges by Hindley. </p> <p> <b> Malcolm Green </b><br><b>Age: 53</b></p> <p>Given a life sentence in 1971 for killing a prostitute, and released after 18 years. Five months later, in 1990, he killed, apparently without motive, a tourist from New Zealand whom he had befriended. He dismembered the body and dumped it, wrapped in plastic bags, at several spots along a road in South Wales. He was jailed again in 1991. </p> <p> <b> Archie Hall</b><br><b>Age: 78</b></p> <p> Between 1977 and 1978 Hall killed the former MP Walter Scott-Elliott and his wife Dorothy, for whom he worked as a butler, two accomplices, who were also thought to be his lovers, and his half-brother. He is serving four life sentences, and is believed to be the oldest prisoner serving a \"natural life\" tariff. In 1995 he wrote to the Observer pleading for the right to die. </p> <p> <b>Ian Brady</b><br><b>Age: 62</b></p> <p>The Moors murderer was given two life sentences in 1966 for the murders of Lesley-Ann Downey, aged 10, John Kilbride, 12, and Edward Evans, 17. The body of 16-year-old Pauline Reade, another victim, was discovered on Saddleworth moor in 1987. Brady has spent more than a year on hunger strike demanding the right to die; judges ruled last year that authorities at Ashworth special hospital were right to force feed him to keep him alive. </p> <p> <b>John Hilton</b><br><b>Age: 71</b></p> <p>Hilton served a life sentence for murdering a man during a robbery at a south London shop in 1962. A month after his release on licence in 1978, he shot a diamond jeweller in the back during another robbery, and also accidentally shot his accomplice, who bled to death. He later confessed to the killings while in custody for another armed robbery. </p> <p> <b>Jeremy Bamber</b><br><b>Age: 39</b></p> <p>Given five life sentences in 1986 for shooting his adoptive parents, his sister and her twin sons in order to land a \u00a3500,000 inheritance. In 1995 he lost an appeal against the then home secretary Douglas Hurd's ruling that he should never be released. Earlier this month, it was announced that the criminal cases review commission, which investigates possible miscarriages of justice, will review his case. </p> <p> <b>John Duffy</b><br><b>Age: 41</b></p> <p>The so-called \"railway killer\" was given seven life terms in 1988 for two murders and three rapes between 1975 and 1986. He gained his nickname after stalking his victims to remote train stations before attacking them. In 1999 he admitted a further 17 sex offences. </p> <p> <b>Dennis Nilsen</b><br><b>Age: 54</b></p> <p> The civil servant was jailed for life in 1983 for six murders and two attempted murders, having killed and dismembered 15 gay men. He picked up rent boys and homeless men at gay clubs in Soho, strangling them and keeping the bodies in his bedroom, sometimes sketching them or having sex with the corpses. He was caught when the drains at his north London house became blocked with body parts. </p> <p> <b>Victor Miller</b><br><b>Age: 45</b></p> <p>A computer operator, he indecently assaulted and murdered a 14-year-old boy after abducting him on his paper round in Hagley, Worcestershire, in 1988. Police believe he may have carried out 28 further sexual assaults; it was after being arrested for another attack that Miller led police to the boy's battered body, hidden under a pile of leaves. The court heard that he preyed on paper boys because they were particularly vulnerable. Has asked to remain in prison for the rest of his life. </p> <p> <b>Rosemary West</b><br><b>Age: 46</b></p> <p>Given 10 life sentences in November 1995 for helping her husband Fred rape, torture and kill young women at their home in Gloucester. He had admitted to 12 murders, but hanged himself in prison while awaiting trial. Among the victims were West's daughter, Heather, her stepdaughter Charmaine, and a lodger pregnant by Fred West. </p> <p> <b>Arthur Hutchinson</b><br><b>Age: 61</b></p> <p>A petty criminal who also had a history of violence, Hutchinson gatecrashed a wedding reception at the home of a Sheffield solicitor in 1983. He stabbed to death the bride's mother, father and brother, before raping her sister at knifepoint. A palm print on a bottle of champagne helped lead police to him. He was jailed in 1984. </p> <p> <b>Victor Castigador</b><br><b>Age: 46</b></p> <p>An illegal immigrant who came to Britain from the Philippines in 1985, Castigador was jailed for life in 1990 for murdering two Sri Lankan security guards during a robbery at a Soho amusement arcade where he himself worked. Along with two other men, he tied up the guards and the female cashier, doused them in white spirit and locked them in a wire cage in the basement before tossing in lit matches. </p> <p> <b>Colin Ireland</b><br><b>Age: 46</b></p> <p>The ex-soldier pleaded guilty in 1993 to torturing and murdering five gay men he picked up in a pub in Kensington, west London. Psychiatrists declared him sane at his trial at the Old Bailey, and Ireland admitted he was a sadist. The court heard that he had made a new year's resolution to become a murderer, and continued until he felt he would qualify as a serial killer. </p> <p> <b>Donald Neilson</b><br><b>Age: 60</b></p> <p>Nicknamed the \"black panther\" because of his trademark balaclava, he shot dead three post office workers during robberies, and later kidnapped the 17-year-old heiress Lesley Whittle in an attempt to extort a ransom. Her body was later found in a drain in Staffordshire. Neilson was caught after two policemen spotted him acting suspiciously outside a pub in 1975. </p> <p>These men and women have received mandatory life sentences. The home secretary has the power to release them on licence at any time. But he is under no obligation to do so. Neither is he under any obligation to refer their cases to, or accept recommendations from, the parole board, the body that advises on the release of prisoners. These men and women are serving \"whole-life\" tariffs. It has been decided - by politicians - that life, in each of their cases, really does mean life. </p> <p>Even at this level, the whole-life tar iff seems remarkably unfair and open to abuse. It goes beyond the manipulation of approval ratings by vote-hungry governments, to the heart of our attitudes and the state of our nation. We exalt a number of this group of murderers as cultural icons and yet despise them intensely. We are faddish and jaded, and demand to be indulged. Michael Howard recognised this as an important aspect of the contract between the governing and the governed in our era when he introduced \"acceptability to the public\" as a criterion for release of life sentence prisoners. </p> <p>In the 1960s, there was a brief flowering of policies concerned with the rehabilitation and reform of criminals, but these were terminated abruptly by the Thatcherite approach to law and order: they did it, now they pay. The Thatcherite market philosophy has also had an impact on the relationship between society and the way that murder is viewed. There has been a privatisation of the act - victims, relatives and murderers have become commodities. The members of the latter group are the most easily tradeable and their names trip off our tongue like those of pop stars or football players. </p> <p>This objectification of murder has given rise to a pornography for which there is a seemingly unquenchable thirst. The ubiquitous \"true crime\" section in our bookshops, squeezed between the science fiction and horror shelves, is a testament to our overwhelming fascination with violence, sex and death. </p> <p>The indefinite life sentence stands as a symbol of the ossification of our thought. As far as we are concerned, the murderers are fixed for ever at the moment in which they killed their victims. </p> <p>Secretly (or not so secretly) we are relieved when the tabloids scream vengeance on our behalf. We allow ourselves to be convinced that we are not dealing with humans but with monsters. By weakly going along with this process, like proles attending an Orwellian Hate, we avoid ever having to consider the merit of each individual's development. Only by classifying them as faceless untermenschen can we justify this behaviour to ourselves. </p> <p>It is by no means to belittle the victims of their crimes to recognise the dignity of a human being. In fact it is difficult to think of a more appropriate response in the face of the taking of life. It is not an insult to their memory to recognise the potential within people for genuine change. This, like murder, is a function of the human condition. It is also understandable that victims' relatives should feel anger and a desire for vengeance. That is why they should not be given responsibility for determining the fate of the wrongdoer. </p> <p>It is not in dispute that those who are a danger to the public should be imprisoned; neither is the imposition of long prison sentences for serious crimes. What is wrong is the extinction of hope in those for whom it should still exist. </p> <p>The whole-life tariff demonstrates our wilful refusal to look at the real person and willingness instead to scream at the hideous shadow that he casts on the wall behind him. This denial of justice is as serious in its own way as the taking of life. It is how we treat the vulnerable, including murderers, that demonstrates the respect we have for ourselves and our strength as a society. </p> <p>The operation of this current sentencing practice is a tribute to the cynicism of our politicians and certain sections of the media. Their ability to create a climate of childlike, misinformed fear and emotional avarice is outstanding. We contribute to this state of affairs by devouring what we are offered without question. </p> <p>The demonisation of these men and women puts them on a pedestal they do not deserve to occupy. It is not that they are inhuman; rather it is that they have exhibited all too human behaviour, albeit in its most destructive form. We should acknowledge this. For their sake and ours, they should not be accorded mythic status. </p> <p>\u0095 Research by Esther Addley.</p>",

It is not that they are inhuman; rather it is that they have exhibited all too human behaviour, albeit in its most destructive form. We should acknowledge this. For their sake and ours, they should not be accorded mythic status. \u0095 Research by Esther Addley.",

      "body": "<p>The long Special Branch interrogation has left me numbed and disorientated. I search the court for friends but the looming faces belong to the police and the lawyers. The magistrate is saying something. Conspiracy charges, risk of flight, remand in custody. The hearing is over in seconds. Then it's a high-speed drive through parts of London I don't know. A long straight road, through some lights, then a right turn. A street sign says Jebb Avenue. The prison walls come into view and the gates open to swallow us.</p> <p>In reception I am stripped, measured, weighed and photographed. Reception smells of carbolic soap and soiled clothes - my clothes. I've been living in them for a week and they're stinking. They are exchanged for prison browns. The shirt collar is frayed, the trousers are stained and the grey woollen socks are damp from sweat that will never wash out.</p> <p>Passing through A Wing with my escort, I see men in flip-flops and vests and baggy prison browns loiter at the top of the stairs. Others, towels slung over their shoulders, fill water jugs or empty piss-pots in the recess. Through half-open doors I glimpse the garish blur of pornographic collages - standard prison decor. We come to A Seg, the special security unit, and go through a gate. An officer shouts after us, One on, and A Seg has a new inmate.</p> <p>Set apart from the rest of the prison, A Seg's compactness, fluorescent lighting and muffled sounds evoke the atmosphere of a hospital ward. A cleaner mops the floor, but everyone is locked up. I am taken to the fours and shown to a cell. It has an iron bed-frame concreted into the floor, a thin foam mattress, a chair and a fixed cupboard. In the far wall there is a radiator and, above it, a high, barred window. The door is pulled shut behind me. My first day as a remand prisoner in Brixton has begun. I sit on the bed and ask myself the question that dominates prisoners' lives: How long? How long am I going to be in here? And will I get through it? This was 20 years ago.</p> <p>Stephen Twinn is brisk, businesslike, assertive. On the wing they say he puts himself about, that he's not afraid to show who is boss. He is Brixton's new governor, is in his early 50s, wears a dickie bow and reads the Telegraph. We stand together on A Wing fours and the prisoners crowd round us.</p> <p>What paper are you from? Write this down: say this is a third world prison. Say this is inhuman, it is degrading. Can you imagine what it is like to be locked up for days so you have to shit in front of another man you don't know? Smell my clothes, we didn't get showers today or yesterday. Write that down. One of the prisoners who has collared Twinn says he is schizophrenic, psychopathic and suicidal, and he wants to be moved to a cell with his cousin. Another complains bitterly that there is no shampoo; another says his mail is being withheld, that he has got a new baby and he's waiting for the pictures. There are no library facilities and the phones haven't been turned on yet. Prison doesn't change anyone, the new father says, it just makes you more angry.</p> <p>The officer in charge of A Wing says prisoners are more inadequate now than they used to be. He gets care in the community cases, shoplifters, the homeless, the chronically drug- and alcohol-dependent. Sixty per cent have been charged with drug-related offences. On Saturday, he received 15 new prisoners, 14 of whom the doctor put straight on the detox register. He should have 12 officers to control the wing. Today he has nine.</p> <p>When he hasn't the staff, he has to bang the men up. That is when they get angry, that is when they start mutilating themselves, killing themselves. Last year, the prisons minister Paul Boateng declared Brixton a \"failing prison\" and ordered that it be \"market tested\" - reviewed for possible privatisation. The old governor was moved out and Twinn arrived to turn the place around.</p> <p>The men surrounding us have just been unlocked after 48 hours behind the door. They are brimming with anger. Twinn thinks our presence is winding them up and that we should move on. I take a last look at A Wing. A Seg has gone. My old cell is indescribably filthy. The bedding should be burned. There is blood on the sheets. Some other stuff, too, but I don't want to look too closely. I tell Twinn I can't believe how squalid the cell is. He says it doesn't look so bad to him. This is Brixton today.</p> <p>In my cell in A Seg I can't imagine getting through the next 24 hours. I don't see how a life is possible. But wherever you are, whatever the conditions, you make a life; it's an irreducible human impulse. Letters and books arrive, newspapers, a radio, your own clothes. There's your family, though family can involve as much pain and guilt as comfort. There are visits and legal visits, there are your co-defendants. You nod cautiously to men on exercise and you start to make friends.</p> <p>In A Seg they are armed robbers for the most part: very serious, professional men. These are the glory days of armed robbery, before grasses and technology get the upper hand; some of them have robbed millions of pounds in raids of commando daring. They are often big men who wear chunky gold jewellery and have blonde girlfriends.</p> <p>One night, a girlfriend is stabbed to death at the foot of a stairwell in a towerblock. The chaplain comes in to break the news to her lover. He disappears behind the door and I don't see him for a long time except when the medical orderly comes round with his tray of tranquillisers and he is at the cell door, knocking back whatever it is he needs to keep his life going.</p> <p>Sometimes I forget I am in prison. When I'm reading, when I'm playing football in the yard, when I'm playing cards with the robbers. When a letter filled with tenderness and news of friends transports me. But I don't forget for long. As the months go by, as summer fades and winter winds whistle through the wire, and more and more time is lost, that question, the prisoners' question, bears down: How long? What is my future to be? It tortures me in my sleep. It drives me mad and it makes me infantile. I take a deck of cards and before I cut I say, if it's red, I'm free. If it's black, it's prison. Black. OK. Two out of three.</p> <p>1979. My second summer in Brixton. A hot year. The cell is stifling. The conspiracy charge has been dropped, a different conspiracy substituted. I lie on the bed in my shorts and stare at the ceiling. Nothing now - not the letters, not the visits, not the new friends - can make this life bearable any more. The heat makes it worse. In the visiting room there are women with almost no clothes on.</p> <p>Twinn wants to explain. Brixton is a large, crumbling, inner-city prison and it has very serious problems. With 750 inmates and capacity for 824, it is not, by official standards, overcrowded. There are some lifers in D Wing, but most inmates are doing short sentences or awaiting trial, deportation or extradition. Some have been inside for 30 years or more, others arrived yesterday.</p> <p>There are 61 nationalities and more than half are from the ethnic minorities: Asian, Chinese, but mainly African or Afro-Caribbean. Many speak no English or speak English badly. There is racism, alcoholism, drug abuse and mental illness. Many of his staff are demoralised. In the old days, Brixton was the main remand prison for London and the south-east. It had 1,000 inmates and 1,000 staff to process them in and out of reception and escort them to and from their court appearances, everywhere from the Old Bailey to Chelmsford crown court.</p> <p>Keeping this complex machine running gave Brixton staff a certain cachet within the service. They lost that when Belmarsh was built and Brixton lost the courts. Staff levels were reduced by half. Notionally, Twinn can count on having 70 officers on duty on weekdays. In practice, he rarely has more than 45. Some of his older officers haven't been able to make the adjustment. They go sick a lot. Everything comes down to staff numbers. When the numbers are low, the prisoners are locked up all day. Twinn rotates the lock-up wing by wing so that at least one wing should be open on any given day. It is not ideal, but it is all he can do. Money is tight and it is getting tighter every year.</p> <p>In the health care centre a cheerful nurse talks about her discussion groups and art therapy groups. The centre is an obvious improvement on the old days when F Wing, the hospital wing, was a byword for maltreatment and neglect. But still, in the dimly lit wards, men lie listless, with a terrible air of dejection and hopelessness about them. If you are in prison, do all you can not to fall sick.</p> <p>We turn into a short corridor. I suggest we move quickly through here, Twinn says. These men are grossly mentally disturbed. A black man's eyes stare out through an observation flap in the steel door. We come to another block. At one cell door an armchair has been pulled right up to the flap. The cell's occupant is a boy who has repeatedly cut himself and is under 24-hour watch. Recently, he has been biting into his arm to rip his veins out with his teeth. The irreducible impulse to make a life, whatever the conditions, is sometimes not irreducible at all.</p> <p>I never came even close to this, but there was a point when the earth seemed to give way beneath my feet, when I seemed to be sinking slowly to the bottom of the sea and the air was being pressed from my lungs. I ask Twinn if we can go to B Seg, the punishment block.</p> <p>The robbers go for their trials and on the news it says they get 18 years and 22 years and life. Summer turns to autumn and the cold winds start again to whistle through the wire. I am on a conveyor belt like everyone else, just waiting my turn before the judges. I am tense and angry and frustrated. I bridle at rules I have until now managed to negotiate, and, inevitably, I end up in B Seg.</p> <p>The punishment block now has only six cells in use, but 20 years ago it had double that. It was a busier and more brutal place then. The cells contained no furniture of any kind. At 8pm the door was unlocked and a bed and mattress placed inside. At 6am next morning, the bed was taken out. That left a piss-pot, a bucket, a water jug and a mug. There was nothing else. There were no books, no papers, no radio. The boredom was crushing.</p> <p>Twinn arranges for me to observe the adjudication in progress. In the old days it was rough justice, aggressively administered. I never heard of anyone getting a not guilty at an adjudication. After my second adjudication, I refused to participate and simply stayed in my cell to be tried in my absence.</p> <p>Today, I am looking at a small, pale, wasted man, a little confused, a hint of slurred speech. He pleads not guilty to throwing his steel tray on the floor but accepts he did what they say he did. He says when he got to the food queue there was only one fishfinger left. Yes, sir, he threw his tray down but he was hungry, sir, and his brother had recently drowned and he is depressed and having bad dreams. He is let off with a caution. When he is gone, the assistant governor turns to me and says he needs help and they'll do what they can to get it to him.</p> <p>Perhaps they will. Perhaps Twinn's energy and leadership will make Brixton a safer, more humane establishment. He has already achieved some obvious improvements and relationships between inmates and staff have clearly eased, helped in no small measure by the recruitment of black and female prison officers. But Brixton to me looks worse now than it was when I was there. Nastier, more squalid, more chaotic. What's your answer, Twinn challenges me. It is a challenge for us all.</p> <p>I go to stand in one of the cells I occupied in the block during my last stay here. In my case, the question, how long?, was met with the answer: no longer. The card I cut turned out to be red. I did not know this when I was in this cell.</p> <p>No one who knows me would say I am a sentimental man, but standing here a memory floods back that leaves me momentarily trembling. It was when the board of visitors made one of their occasional inspections. The door opened and a man in a tweed suit and with the plummiest of accents said, Any complaints? I was sitting on the floor of a bare cell and I hadn't spoken to anyone for a week. I was too stunned to answer and before I got a word out the door had closed. They opened up my neighbour and I heard him shout, Any fucking complaints? Are you kidding? I heard the prison officers move in and restrain him. The last I heard was him shouting, half strangled, but resonant with outrage, I wouldn't keep a dog like this.</p> <p>Twinn asks if I've seen enough here and I say that I have.</p> <p>\u0095 Ronan Bennett's first novel was The Second Prison, published by Review \u00a36.99.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Grace Hall, 40</strong> <br>Sentence: life <br>Crime: murder</p> <p>I was 21 when I got convicted in 1982. It was my first sentence. I served 18 years and saw a lot of changes in that time. When I got my sentence there wasn't much help available; they just put you in jail. I'd been in six months when I stumbled across Alcoholics Anonymous. They were holding meetings in the chapel. My friend, Patsy, and I had gone to look for communion wine but we heard voices from the meeting and ended up joining in. Nobody had recommended I go, it wasn't set up that way in those days. Prison was about containment, especially for the lifers like me. It wasn't until I reached about eight or 10 years into my sentence that they started rehabilitating us. </p> <p>Patsy was a short-termer and when she finished her sentence she went out and died of a drug overdose. So many die like that. </p> <p>It was ridiculous that nobody tried to give me treatment for my addictions. My crime was alcohol- and drug-related because I killed my ex-boyfriend when I was totally high. I kept up my drug habit inside for 11 years. Drugs were easier than booze to get hold of. Towards the end of my sentence I started on heroin because it was harder to pick up in the mandatory drugs test, which really upped the number of heroin users in the system. The figures say drug use has gone down. The reality is smack use has gone up. </p> <p>But what's disturbing is that, in some prisons, the governor wants to prove she's got a drug-free prison so the prison officers just don't test people. My friend and I once set up an experiment. We told a prison officer about eight people who'd been using heroin that evening and they busted one of them. That's typical. It's their way of fiddling the figures so they look drug-free. </p> <p>More prison courses and treatments started in the late 80s and early 90s, so now there are more options available.

      "bodyText": "Grace Hall, 40 Sentence: life Crime: murder I was 21 when I got convicted in 1982. It was my first sentence. I served 18 years and saw a lot of changes in that time. When I got my sentence there wasn't much help available; they just put you in jail. I'd been in six months when I stumbled across Alcoholics Anonymous. They were holding meetings in the chapel. My friend, Patsy, and I had gone to look for communion wine but we heard voices from the meeting and ended up joining in. Nobody had recommended I go, it wasn't set up that way in those days. Prison was about containment, especially for the lifers like me. It wasn't until I reached about eight or 10 years into my sentence that they started rehabilitating us. Patsy was a short-termer and when she finished her sentence she went out and died of a drug overdose. So many die like that. It was ridiculous that nobody tried to give me treatment for my addictions. My crime was alcohol- and drug-related because I killed my ex-boyfriend when I was totally high. I kept up my drug habit inside for 11 years. Drugs were easier than booze to get hold of. Towards the end of my sentence I started on heroin because it was harder to pick up in the mandatory drugs test, which really upped the number of heroin users in the system. The figures say drug use has gone down. The reality is smack use has gone up. But what's disturbing is that, in some prisons, the governor wants to prove she's got a drug-free prison so the prison officers just don't test people. My friend and I once set up an experiment. We told a prison officer about eight people who'd been using heroin that evening and they busted one of them. That's typical. It's their way of fiddling the figures so they look drug-free. More prison courses and treatments started in the late 80s and early 90s, so now there are more options available. But there's still problems. For a start, there aren't enough courses because mostly the officers are running these things and they are needed for discipline. Towards the end of my sentence I became a born-again Christian. An ex-lifer came in, she had a job with a Christian organisation and used to come in and talk to me. Then one day, I totally stopped my drinking and drugs and I haven't had anything for nearly eight years. The religion helped me more than prison, but prison gave me an environment where I was kept safe until I could find a way to stop. If I'd been on the street I would have been dead before I found a way to stop, like my friends. Prison saved my life until I was able to get straight enough to find a way.

      "body": "<p>I am in a screening room somewhere in the suburbs of Paris, waiting for the film of my novel Intimacy to begin. A few months ago, I saw some of the rushes, but I have seen no cut material. Now the film is almost finished, with most of the scenes in their definitive order and a good deal of the music in place. The only missing scene is the final one, where the characters played by Kerry Fox and Mark Rylance meet for the last time. </p> <p>The French director Patrice Ch\u00e9reau sits behind me. Although he and I worked closely together at times, and the film was shot in English, the script was written by his own writer, a woman, in French. I had decided I'd spent long enough with the material and lacked the heart to look at it again. So it is my film but not mine. I made the characters and most of the story, but Patrice transformed, cast and cut it; and, of course, his style and voice as a director are his own. </p> <p>Patrice arranged to come and see me in London a couple of years ago. He was shy, he said, and didn't speak good English. My French is hopeless, but it seemed better to meet without an interpreter. He is, I suppose, 10 years older than me. He is gentle and unpretentious; modest but not unaware of his own ability. He is less impatient and bad-tempered than me. </p> <p>In our first meeting he explained that he wanted to make a film of Intimacy, which he had read in French. Also, he said he liked mystories, particularly Nightlight, collected in Love in a Blue Time. In it a couple who run into each other by chance begin to meet once a week, on Wednesday afternoons, to make love. Somehow, they never speak; after a while they are unable to. </p> <p>At that time, I did not know Patrice's work as a director and actor. I had seen neither of the films for which he is known internationally, La Reine Margot and Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train, and had no idea of his impressive reputation in France. This made it easier for me to see him without enthusiasm or dismay. </p> <p>After we'd looked at one another for a bit - not unlike the couple at the beginning of the film, about to embark on something big, neither one knowing the \"little things\" about the other - I said he should take what he wanted from my work and make the film he wanted to make. That was easy to say, but I didn't quite mean it. Later, I thought, what can these two strangers, a gay Frenchman and a straight British-Indian, make together, if anything? </p> <p>Collaborations don't always succeed. A few years ago, a director asked me to come up with an idea we would then develop into a script. Together, he and I sat in an expensive rented room every weekday afternoon, for a month. Most of the time he seemed to have his head in his hands, while I made notes on various stories I was writing, and then put my head in my hands. We would go round and round, but rarely forwards. Occasionally, we'd have an idea we liked, or break into laughter, but we remained mysterious to one another, too guarded and too respectful. I expected him to take the lead, to tell me what he wanted. Maybe he expected the same of me. The project disappeared into a miasma of misplaced politeness. I suspect we were both trying to write, and were inhibiting one another. </p> <p>There was little hesitation in Patrice; he didn't lack tenacity or appear to doubt this was a film he wanted to make. So we started to meet regularly in London. We decided early on that Intimacy was too internal and probably too dark to make a conventional film on its own. It could, though, function as the background to, or beginning of, another film. We needed something else on top - more stories, characters, action. </p> <p>I showed him a collection of my stories in manuscript, Midnight All Day, to see whether there was anything in them he fancied. Some of the material from Strangers When We Meet went into the film; parts of In a Blue Time were utilised; and ideas from other stories: I forget which. During our meetings we improvised stories, we gossiped, we talked about the theatre, literature, our lives. </p> <p>If our age seems \"un-ideological\" compared with the the mid-1960s to mid-1980s; if Britain seems hedonistic and politically torpid, it might be because politics have moved inside, into the body. The politics of personal relationships, of private need, of gender, marriage, sexuality, the place of children, have replaced that of society, which seems uncontrollable. </p> <p>So we talked about bodies, about death and decay; about Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon; about the hyper-realism of some recent photography, and how close you could get to the face without losing the image. We talked about how many modern visual artists are interested in the body and its needs: the body rather than the mind or ideas; and the body on its own, in relative isolation. </p> <p>We talked about what bodies do and what they tell us. We seem to inhabit a culture of disgust and of shock, in which humans are reduced to zero, the achievements of culture rendered meaningless. Yet this kind of fastidious despair can become an aesthetic pose, creating its own cultural privileges and be coming a kind of vanity. </p> <p>We talked about the character Jay, about London and the speed with which it is changing into an international city, about the couple who meet without speaking. Why don't they talk rather than touch? What is the terror of communication? If you speak to someone, what might happen? If you don't, what other possibilities are there? To what extent are people disposable? What do we owe them or they us? </p> <p>Patrice seemed interested in the power of impersonal sexuality, in passion without relationship, in the way people can be narcissistically fascinated by one another's bodies and their own sexual pleasure, while keeping away from strong feeling and emotional complexity. We talked about what sex enables people to do together, and what it can stop them doing. Impersonality frees the imagination, of course; but imagination isn't sufficient when it comes to other people. What we usually need is more of them and less of us. We have to let a certain amount of them in. But that can seem like the hardest, most frightening thing, particularly as you get older, particularly when you feel you have failed before. </p> <p>What Patrice wanted was to capture the desperation of Jay and Claire's lovemaking. These intense sessions were called \"the Wednesdays\" and would punctuate the film, different each time. </p> <p>We are fascinated by what goes on in other couples' privacy. Their bodies, thoughts and conversation are compelling. However, I can't help wondering whether sexuality is better written than filmed. Looking may be more immediate than reading, but it may also fail to capture the intricacies of feeling. It won't necessarily increase our understanding. In fact, all it may do is make us embarrassed, or conscious that we are watching a choreographed sexual act. It might merely make us feel left out. Perhaps this is because of the way sexuality is usually portrayed on film. </p> <p>Patrice and I talked about keeping the camera close to the bodies - not overlighting them, or making them look pornographically enticing or idealised. The point is to look at how difficult sex is, how terrifying, and what an obscenity our pleasures can be. Patrice will, therefore, have to make a sexually explicit film. </p> <p>This will initially, I guess, seem shocking in the cinema. Not that it won't take long for the shock to wear off, and for the act to seem common. The kiss between the boys in My Beautiful Laundrette seemed outrageous and even liberating, to some people, in the mid-1980s; now you can hardly turn on the television without seeing boys snogging, particularly on the sports channels. </p> <p>Interest in sexuality takes different forms at different times: it might be paedophilia, miscegenation, gerontophilia, lesbianism or fetishism. But there always seems to be some aspect of desire that is of concern. It's the one thing that never goes away, or leaves people's minds. Perhaps desire never stops feeling like madness. </p> <p>Our conversations would fertilise the film rather than determine it. I generated ideas for him to use, alter or throw away as he liked, trying not to become too possessive of them. Patrice had his own interests and preoccupations, and is not the sort merely to find a style to fit the writer. What we tried to do was find a starting point to help one another. </p> <p>Shortly afterwards, the scriptwriter began work. Scripts started to arrive regularly at my house. They got longer and longer. It always seems endless, the continuous sifting of material. Patrice moved to London, looked for locations and began to see actors for the main parts. Among those cast were Marianne Faithfull and Timothy Spall. Almost all the male actors we met were terrified of having others see their bodies: there was no way they would strip for the camera. The women seemed to expect it would be required. </p> <p>During filming Patrice sometimes dropped by in the evening for a drink. I could see on his face how stressful and difficult making a movie is. On top of everything else, he was making a film in a foreign language, with a mostly English crew, in a city he didn't know well. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, most film directors I know are a bag of maladies. They want you to know how tough their job is. What exactly is tough about it? I suppose it is hard wanting something to be so good; it is hard to care so much about something that could so easily be dismissed. Fortunately, Patrice mostly shot what he needed and was pleased with the performances. </p> <p>Now the almost completed film rushes at me. The camera moves quickly; the cutting is fast and the music loud, not only for effect but to show us the force, speed and impersonality of London today. Perhaps it takes a foreign director to make London look the way it feels. This seems like the city I live in. The method of filming represents, too, the wild fury of Jay's mind. </p> <p>At the end of the screening my mind seems to be going in all directions at once. I try to clear my head. What do I feel? Relief, confusion, excitement, dismay, delight! Bits of criticism surface. I have to try and say something coherent. My mind feels crowded with important, irrelevant remarks. </p> <p>As always, Patrice is patient. He listens; we talk and argue. I am laudatory, critical and apologetic at the same time. I have ideas for cuts, changes, rearrangements. There are several things I don't understand, that don't seem clear. I keep saying I have only seen the film once. He says that is how many times, if we are lucky, the audience will see the film. More screenings, he says, and you'll be too sympathetic, you'll understand too much. </p> <p>In the end, when finishing the film, I know he will go his own way. That is what I would recommend; it is what I would do. For me, it is enough that what has been accomplished was worth the effort and a pleasure. Whether anyone else will agree is up to them. </p> <p>\u0095 Edited from an essay in the current issue of <a href=\"http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk\">Prospect magazine</a> For subscription details, call 020-7255 1278.

Some of the material from Strangers When We Meet went into the film; parts of In a Blue Time were utilised; and ideas from other stories: I forget which. During our meetings we improvised stories, we gossiped, we talked about the theatre, literature, our lives. If our age seems \"un-ideological\" compared with the the mid-1960s to mid-1980s; if Britain seems hedonistic and politically torpid, it might be because politics have moved inside, into the body. The politics of personal relationships, of private need, of gender, marriage, sexuality, the place of children, have replaced that of society, which seems uncontrollable. So we talked about bodies, about death and decay; about Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon; about the hyper-realism of some recent photography, and how close you could get to the face without losing the image. We talked about how many modern visual artists are interested in the body and its needs: the body rather than the mind or ideas; and the body on its own, in relative isolation. We talked about what bodies do and what they tell us. We seem to inhabit a culture of disgust and of shock, in which humans are reduced to zero, the achievements of culture rendered meaningless. Yet this kind of fastidious despair can become an aesthetic pose, creating its own cultural privileges and be coming a kind of vanity. We talked about the character Jay, about London and the speed with which it is changing into an international city, about the couple who meet without speaking. Why don't they talk rather than touch? What is the terror of communication? If you speak to someone, what might happen? If you don't, what other possibilities are there? To what extent are people disposable? What do we owe them or they us? Patrice seemed interested in the power of impersonal sexuality, in passion without relationship, in the way people can be narcissistically fascinated by one another's bodies and their own sexual pleasure, while keeping away from strong feeling and emotional complexity. We talked about what sex enables people to do together, and what it can stop them doing. Impersonality frees the imagination, of course; but imagination isn't sufficient when it comes to other people. What we usually need is more of them and less of us. We have to let a certain amount of them in. But that can seem like the hardest, most frightening thing, particularly as you get older, particularly when you feel you have failed before. What Patrice wanted was to capture the desperation of Jay and Claire's lovemaking. These intense sessions were called \"the Wednesdays\" and would punctuate the film, different each time. We are fascinated by what goes on in other couples' privacy. Their bodies, thoughts and conversation are compelling. However, I can't help wondering whether sexuality is better written than filmed. Looking may be more immediate than reading, but it may also fail to capture the intricacies of feeling. It won't necessarily increase our understanding. In fact, all it may do is make us embarrassed, or conscious that we are watching a choreographed sexual act. It might merely make us feel left out. Perhaps this is because of the way sexuality is usually portrayed on film. Patrice and I talked about keeping the camera close to the bodies - not overlighting them, or making them look pornographically enticing or idealised. The point is to look at how difficult sex is, how terrifying, and what an obscenity our pleasures can be. Patrice will, therefore, have to make a sexually explicit film. This will initially, I guess, seem shocking in the cinema. Not that it won't take long for the shock to wear off, and for the act to seem common. The kiss between the boys in My Beautiful Laundrette seemed outrageous and even liberating, to some people, in the mid-1980s; now you can hardly turn on the television without seeing boys snogging, particularly on the sports channels. Interest in sexuality takes different forms at different times: it might be paedophilia, miscegenation, gerontophilia, lesbianism or fetishism. But there always seems to be some aspect of desire that is of concern. It's the one thing that never goes away, or leaves people's minds. Perhaps desire never stops feeling like madness. Our conversations would fertilise the film rather than determine it. I generated ideas for him to use, alter or throw away as he liked, trying not to become too possessive of them. Patrice had his own interests and preoccupations, and is not the sort merely to find a style to fit the writer. What we tried to do was find a starting point to help one another. Shortly afterwards, the scriptwriter began work. Scripts started to arrive regularly at my house. They got longer and longer. It always seems endless, the continuous sifting of material. Patrice moved to London, looked for locations and began to see actors for the main parts. Among those cast were Marianne Faithfull and Timothy Spall. Almost all the male actors we met were terrified of having others see their bodies: there was no way they would strip for the camera. The women seemed to expect it would be required. During filming Patrice sometimes dropped by in the evening for a drink. I could see on his face how stressful and difficult making a movie is. On top of everything else, he was making a film in a foreign language, with a mostly English crew, in a city he didn't know well. Unsurprisingly, most film directors I know are a bag of maladies. They want you to know how tough their job is. What exactly is tough about it? I suppose it is hard wanting something to be so good; it is hard to care so much about something that could so easily be dismissed. Fortunately, Patrice mostly shot what he needed and was pleased with the performances. Now the almost completed film rushes at me. The camera moves quickly; the cutting is fast and the music loud, not only for effect but to show us the force, speed and impersonality of London today. Perhaps it takes a foreign director to make London look the way it feels. This seems like the city I live in. The method of filming represents, too, the wild fury of Jay's mind. At the end of the screening my mind seems to be going in all directions at once. I try to clear my head. What do I feel? Relief, confusion, excitement, dismay, delight! Bits of criticism surface. I have to try and say something coherent. My mind feels crowded with important, irrelevant remarks. As always, Patrice is patient. He listens; we talk and argue. I am laudatory, critical and apologetic at the same time. I have ideas for cuts, changes, rearrangements. There are several things I don't understand, that don't seem clear. I keep saying I have only seen the film once. He says that is how many times, if we are lucky, the audience will see the film. More screenings, he says, and you'll be too sympathetic, you'll understand too much. In the end, when finishing the film, I know he will go his own way. That is what I would recommend; it is what I would do. For me, it is enough that what has been accomplished was worth the effort and a pleasure. Whether anyone else will agree is up to them. \u0095 Edited from an essay in the current issue of Prospect magazine For subscription details, call 020-7255 1278.

These can then be swapped for free CDs or \"dream music experiences\", such as meeting celebrities or chatting to them on the internet. The drive is being supported by direct marketing activity, TV advertising and ads on millions of Coke cans. The promotion also includes a tabloid-style magazine, which features a catalogue of the free CDs on offer as well as news and gossip. Separately, News International, which publishes the Sun and News of the World, has announced it will be running its Free Books for Schools promotion for a third year. The inititative is run in conjunction with Walkers Crisps and the book industry.",

That is the damning conclusion of a new report from Shelter which details the appalling housing conditions that many refugees who have fled to the UK are living in. </p> <p>The study is based on results collected by environmental health officers from five local authorities in the course of their inspections. They found that one in six of the dwellings visited was unfit for human habitation, mostly because the properties were in a poor state of repair and had unsatisfactory cooking facilities. But the officers also found adolescent girls lodged in hostels with adult men and children living without adults to care for them.</p> <p>Carlena Thomas, chairwoman of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health's working party on asylum issues, said her colleagues across the country have discovered instances of asylum seekers living in damp infested homes with little or no heating, where the walls are lined with black mould giving rise to breathing problems. </p> <p>Deborah Garvie, who wrote the Shelter report, said the decision to undertake the study was triggered by the charity's housing advice centres reporting an upsurge in the number of asylum seekers using their services. \"We heard increasing stories of asylum seekers being housed in sub-standard accommodation,\" she said. </p> <p>Between 1997-98 and 1999-00, the number of refugee clients nearly tripled from 1,276 to 3,365.

These include faulty gas appliances and flammable furniture, two of the biggest causes of death by fire.

It says: \"The wealth of experience and knowledge developed by local housing authorities and other housing providers has been bypassed.\"</p> <p>Many departments, particularly in the south-east and London where housing is expensive, entered into contracts with private landlords in other parts of the country to house their clients. Rental payments were guaranteed by social services department. \"It's an absolutely ideal opportunity for landlords to make money,\" said Garvie. This is partly because they have fewer rights than other private tenants, and so are less likely to complain.</p> <p>The housing of refugees far from the council responsible for them means that in many cases few checks have been conducted to ensure that the accommodation they are being sent to is up to scratch.</p> <p>The poor conditions that asylum seekers are forced to accept also has the unintended consequence of undermining efforts by environmental health officers to drive up standards in the sector, the report says. Ms Garvie said: \"Good local authorities have been trying to clean up the private rented sector and they had got to the point that landlords were finding it difficult to let sub-standard property. Now the landlords are finding a new market for these properties.\"</p> <p>The report was based on evidence collected when the 1996 Asylum and Immigration Act introduced by the last government was still in place.

He also acknowledged that the events of the Scottish past sprang more easily to his mind than events in his own personal history.</p> <p>He could link his own experiences of invading Germany with the brutalities centuries previously of the English rich forcing poor crofters off the Highlands to make way for lucrative sheep grazing - the subject of his 1963 book, The Highland Clearances - without affectation or bathos. His cold head and hot passion may have been uneasy companions, but produced a high order of exact description of places and events, mixed with telling human concern.</p> <p>With nearly 20 published books, selling millions - and some in print for more than 30 years - Prebble was perhaps one of the last dual masters of newspaper journalism and literature. He kept pace with the times by also writing and filming for television.</p> <p>Probably his greatest impact on the popular imagination came through the 1964 film, Zulu, about the defence of the Rorke's Drift mission, in Natal, in 1879, by a small group of British soldiers facing 4,000 Zulus. The director, Cy Endfield, got the idea from reading an article by Prebble, and invited him to co-write the film.</p> <p>Prebble came originally of Scottish stock. After the Reformation, the Prebbles became dissenters; Abraham Prebble fled to America in 1636. John's own father, a naval man who became an unskilled labourer and a Smithfield porter, took his family to Saskatchewan in 1921 in the hope of better things, when the boy was six.</p> <p>They did not arrive: all America was going into the great depression. Prebble and his family returned back in Britain with the help of a high anglican vicar, who had married them in Shoreditch and offered to employ them as caretakers in his Earls Court church hall. Prebble sensed a condescending implication that God was in a social class rather above their own, and became a non-believer.</p> <p>Though he had a short story published in the Boy's Own paper for nine guineas - on the mummified head of Roderick Mackenzie, at one time thought to be that of the Prince Charles Edward - Prebble had no further successs at that time.</p> <p>On leaving Latymer school, for which he had gained a scholarship, he took a job as clerk with a south London estate agent. Having to collect rents from slum properties pushed him towards communism. But when he offered his services to the republicans in the Spanish civil war, he was told not to bother: the Communist party had lost many middle-class people like him and now needed working-class martyrs - a cynicical attitude that Prebble well remembered when he broke with the party some years later.</p> <p>Answering a Daily Telegraph advertisement in 1934, he joined Century Press as a reporter on what was to be a rival to the Draper's Record. Using classic reporters' wiles, without realising he was doing so, he found out where the influential Sears Roebuck fashion buyer was staying in London, and interviewed him. He stayed for four years and was then conscripted into the forces.</p> <p>Prebble's was a strange war. A bespectacled communist culture-vulture with a serious manner and chilling politeness, he was not a likely soldier, but seems to have had an indestructable, if not charmed, life.</p> <p>Sent to an anti-aircraft training regiment in North Wales, he found the camp a bizarre home-from-home for much of the war - in the course of which, with the Royal Artillery, he switched to radar engineering; returned to his unit from an officers' training course at his own request; was arrested for possible sedition - a charge later reduced to conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline - for signing a petition demanding a second front to ease the pressure on Russia; and was looked at askance for creating the first wallpaper in the British army, for selling copies of the Daily Worker and for organising political debates among the men.</p> <p>In 1945, unsupervised on secret radar work, Prebble jumped aboard an invasion boat heading for Holland and worked his way through to Germany with the army. This gave him the inspiration to write. He mistrusted the role of conqueror and noted with bleak compassion and dry, almost imperceptible, humour the ways of both conquerors and conquered.</p> <p>Irma Grese, the sadistic Nazi concentration camp officer, spat in his face after luring him to the wire fence of the camp in which she herself was now confined: Prebble's description of the incident gained from his apparent lack of emotion. Much of all this was thought too \"serious\" for the Soldier newspaper, though some of his material was used; he joined the British army newspaper unit in Hamburg at the end of the war as sergeant-reporter.</p> <p>His decency and lack of easy sentimentality shone through his war writings, and gave the impetus for two war novels and his first published novel, Where The Sea Breaks, in which the crew of a German aircraft take over a small Scottish island on which they have crashed. The book did not bring fame or fortune.</p> <p>Briefly, Lord Beaverbrook advanced Prebble's journalistic career, employing him either despite, or mischeviously because, he was a communist. Spirited to what he called \"this dissembling little man's\" south of France villa, and told to write a story for the Daily Express about the rebirth of Monaco after the war, Prebble started his story with the blunt statement that the only building in Monaco that did not look rundown was the offices of the Communist party.</p> <p>Beaverbrook queried it, but published the piece. Later, an editor who had not been consulted about his appointment fired him. Prebble, not an easy subject for seduction, was glad to go. \"I cannot say I ever liked this man,\" was Prebble's curt dismissal of Beaverbrook.</p> <p>But he had got his foot into Fleet Street, and worked for the Daily Mail and others as columnist, feature writer and reporter until 1960, when his books and dramatisations for radio and television, mainly on Scotland and its troubles, took over. He was widely praised for helping to restore Scottish self-worth. His semi-autobiography, Landscapes and Memories, won the McVitie's Prize for 1993 Scottish Writer of the Year.</p> <p>In 1936, he married Betty Goldby, by whom he had two sons and one daughter. In 1994, after his first wife's death, he married Jan Reid, who survives him.</p> <p>\u0095 John Prebble, writer and historian, born June 23 1915; died January 30 2001</p>",

Answering a Daily Telegraph advertisement in 1934, he joined Century Press as a reporter on what was to be a rival to the Draper's Record. Using classic reporters' wiles, without realising he was doing so, he found out where the influential Sears Roebuck fashion buyer was staying in London, and interviewed him. He stayed for four years and was then conscripted into the forces. Prebble's was a strange war. A bespectacled communist culture-vulture with a serious manner and chilling politeness, he was not a likely soldier, but seems to have had an indestructable, if not charmed, life. Sent to an anti-aircraft training regiment in North Wales, he found the camp a bizarre home-from-home for much of the war - in the course of which, with the Royal Artillery, he switched to radar engineering; returned to his unit from an officers' training course at his own request; was arrested for possible sedition - a charge later reduced to conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline - for signing a petition demanding a second front to ease the pressure on Russia; and was looked at askance for creating the first wallpaper in the British army, for selling copies of the Daily Worker and for organising political debates among the men. In 1945, unsupervised on secret radar work, Prebble jumped aboard an invasion boat heading for Holland and worked his way through to Germany with the army. This gave him the inspiration to write. He mistrusted the role of conqueror and noted with bleak compassion and dry, almost imperceptible, humour the ways of both conquerors and conquered. Irma Grese, the sadistic Nazi concentration camp officer, spat in his face after luring him to the wire fence of the camp in which she herself was now confined: Prebble's description of the incident gained from his apparent lack of emotion. Much of all this was thought too \"serious\" for the Soldier newspaper, though some of his material was used; he joined the British army newspaper unit in Hamburg at the end of the war as sergeant-reporter. His decency and lack of easy sentimentality shone through his war writings, and gave the impetus for two war novels and his first published novel, Where The Sea Breaks, in which the crew of a German aircraft take over a small Scottish island on which they have crashed. The book did not bring fame or fortune. Briefly, Lord Beaverbrook advanced Prebble's journalistic career, employing him either despite, or mischeviously because, he was a communist. Spirited to what he called \"this dissembling little man's\" south of France villa, and told to write a story for the Daily Express about the rebirth of Monaco after the war, Prebble started his story with the blunt statement that the only building in Monaco that did not look rundown was the offices of the Communist party. Beaverbrook queried it, but published the piece. Later, an editor who had not been consulted about his appointment fired him. Prebble, not an easy subject for seduction, was glad to go. \"I cannot say I ever liked this man,\" was Prebble's curt dismissal of Beaverbrook. But he had got his foot into Fleet Street, and worked for the Daily Mail and others as columnist, feature writer and reporter until 1960, when his books and dramatisations for radio and television, mainly on Scotland and its troubles, took over. He was widely praised for helping to restore Scottish self-worth. His semi-autobiography, Landscapes and Memories, won the McVitie's Prize for 1993 Scottish Writer of the Year. In 1936, he married Betty Goldby, by whom he had two sons and one daughter. In 1994, after his first wife's death, he married Jan Reid, who survives him. \u0095 John Prebble, writer and historian, born June 23 1915; died January 30 2001",

Aumont served with the Free French forces in Tunisia, Italy and France, earning the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur and the Croix de Guerre for his bravery.

      "bodyText": "Letsbuyit.com, the struggling online retailer, has announced massive job cuts as it attempts to stave off bankruptcy. The UK-based company said it would lay off 200 of its 350 staff and close its operations in several countries. Letsbuyit was dramatically pulled back from the brink last week. A German investment firm run by a former computer hacker supplied the \u00a32.5m needed to guarantee the company's immediate future. However, it needs \u00a325m to take it through to profitability and Letsbuyit said it was still in talks with potential investors. The lack of good news sent Letsbuyit's share price tumbling 26% in Frankfurt, with over 6m shares being traded in the early morning as investors fled the stock. Recently, the stock climbed as much as 200% on the back of more positive news from the company. Analysts say Letsbuyit is an attractive buy because of the parlous state of its shares. However, there is still enormous doubt over the viability of the company's business model. Letsbuyit brings customers together to boost their buying and bargaining power over the web. However, the company spends more on subsidising free delivery of goods than it makes in profit. Relevant story Jan 19: Reprieve for Letsbuyit.com",

We have so far spared you the multitude of moans that have been arriving since last August, but a disturbing similarity between them means this reticence must end. A recent Which? survey found that only one in seven Time computer owners would recommend the brand to friends, compared to four out of five Apple owners. </p> <p>From various readers' experience it would seem that this is not so much due to faulty equipment, non-deliveries and mysterious charges, but the frequent inability of customer services and the \u00a31-per-minute helpline to assist (or even answer the phones). Alex Anderson was unable to use his new Time machine to connect to the internet because the modem was incompatible with the device driver. It cost him \u00a3300 to find this out as Time's helpdesk, on the rare occasions when he managed to make contact, failed to identify the problem. Time, however, has refused to address the issue of liability in writing. </p> <p>A faulty computer was delivered to Daniel Taylor of Leamington Spa and eventually Time arranged for it to be collected. The wrong monitor was delivered on three occasions, two of them to the wrong address, and Taylor's finance company, which tried to assist, reported that it was \"unable to obtain satisfactory contact with the retailer\". </p> <p>Time collected the faulty PC received by Nick Noakes of London, then lost it. He was told that Time's finance company could not cancel his credit agreement until it had heard from Time and Time refused to get in touch until it had examined the computer it had lost. </p> <p>John Bradbeer of Portsmouth and Cynthia Parnaby of Stokesley, N Yorks, both cancelled their orders after their computers failed to turn up, but both were harassed for payment none the less. Kalpesh Intwala, of London, had \u00a31,248 debited from his account although he had cancelled his order, and P Meinert of Redditch, Worcs, found her order had been cancelled without notice or explanation by Time itself. Joanne Perry bought her machine on interest-free credit but three payments were deducted from her account immediately. Time couldn't help so she cancelled the agreement then found herself pursued for arrears. </p> <p>K Taylor of Farnham, Surrey received isolated components of his new equipment (without his delivery advice), but not the bulk of it, although his payment was cleared with contrasting promptness. Roger Sutton overran his credit deadline and was charged interest which worked out at 34%. He paid off the loan and queried the penalty, but the only reply he received was a new bill demanding an extra, unexplained \u00a3346. His letters asking for a breakdown have gone unanswered. </p> <p>\u0095 Consumer contacts Time's amiable, but leisurely, press officer in September and weekly coaxings do nothing to prompt a reply. \"We'd better be upfront,\" he says, finally, a month later, \"We're investing in new systems to speed things up which means that we are responding more slowly and having trouble tracking the orders of some customers.\" </p> <p>Exhausted by this effort, he falls silent for another five weeks then vanishes. He is replaced by an equally amiable, equally leisurely person who requires a month and a half to get back to us. Meanwhile, it is announced that Time is in urgent refinancing talks with its bankers, having overestimated its market and Trading Standards says it has received complaints. </p> <p>As for our sufferers: Anderson has been given a new modem but is still \u00a3300 out of pocket; Parnaby, Noakes and Intwala have been promised a refund; Daniel Taylor, having been told by Time to seek legal aid, was given a refund when Consumer raised his case; Sutton's account was found to be in credit after all and is to be refunded; and Bradbeer's order has at last been cancelled. Alas for the others, we're still waiting for Time to get in touch ... </p> <p><strong> No guarantee</strong><br> </p> <p> Joan Samuels of Barton-on-Sea, Hants, bought an iron last June. It developed a fault in November and the retailer replaced it under the guarantee. However, she was told that the year-long maker's guarantee did not apply to her new iron. </p> <p>\u0095 There is no law governing guarantees for replacement goods, says a spokesman for the Institute of Trading Standards. \"If you have a year's warranty on an item which goes wrong after 11 months, say, it is not reasonable to expect another year's warranty.\" </p> <p>If, however, the replacement packs up after a few months you might expect a partial refund based on the amount of use you had had from it. </p> <p><strong> Burning question</strong><br> </p> <p> It is a frequently aired injustice that airlines oblige us to surrender our luggage at check-in then shrug off the blame if it is mishandled. Bruno Martelli's designer bag was returned to him with a large hole burned into it, so he rang British Airways and was told to write to customer relations. A fortnight later he received a letter advising him that there was a backlog of complaints; a fortnight after that, he had a further letter telling him that he should have addressed his woe to baggage claims, not to the address he had been given. </p> <p>As baggage claims needed to receive complaints within seven days and those seven days had long since elapsed, BA absolved itself of responsibility. </p> <p>\u0095 BA says that it has not been able to trace Martelli's records because he had not supplied a \"complaint report\" (mysteriously, this does not prevent the press office from identifying him) and had ignored three requests for one. Martelli says he never received such a request. \"He has still not provided documentation confirming the value of the luggage, but we have now accepted the claim in order not to prolong the matter further,\" says a spokeswoman. \"We've sent him \u00a370 in full settlement.\" </p> <p><strong> On his bike</strong><br> </p> <p> Simon Bateson of Brentwood, Essex, checked in his new bike, dismantled, wadded and packed in a bike bag, before boarding a Virgin Express flight to Milan. At no point, he says, was he asked to sign a disclaimer notice, accepting liability if the item was damaged. He arrived safely but his bag was nowhere to be seen. When it turned up a day later, the \u00a380 bike bag was covered in footprints, the reinforced fabric was holed and the bike inside dented. Virgin promised to refer his details to its insurance company but weeks later claimed it held no responsibility for fragile or valuable items. Bateson therefore decided to claim for the bag only, but has so far met with silence. </p> <p>\u0095 Virgin Express points out that its conditions of carriage absolve it from responsibility for fragile, valuable, perishable or oversized luggage, although under the terms of the Warsaw Convention it pays out the splendid sum of \u00a318 per kilo (a figure arrived at in 1929, as regular Consumer readers will know) if ordinary bags are lost or damaged. \"However, something has clearly gone wrong,\" says a spokesman. \"As a goodwill gesture we'll give Mr Bateson \u00a380 to buy a new bag.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 020-7713 4731, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a>.</p>",

Roger Sutton overran his credit deadline and was charged interest which worked out at 34%. He paid off the loan and queried the penalty, but the only reply he received was a new bill demanding an extra, unexplained \u00a3346. His letters asking for a breakdown have gone unanswered. \u0095 Consumer contacts Time's amiable, but leisurely, press officer in September and weekly coaxings do nothing to prompt a reply. \"We'd better be upfront,\" he says, finally, a month later, \"We're investing in new systems to speed things up which means that we are responding more slowly and having trouble tracking the orders of some customers.\" Exhausted by this effort, he falls silent for another five weeks then vanishes. He is replaced by an equally amiable, equally leisurely person who requires a month and a half to get back to us. Meanwhile, it is announced that Time is in urgent refinancing talks with its bankers, having overestimated its market and Trading Standards says it has received complaints. As for our sufferers: Anderson has been given a new modem but is still \u00a3300 out of pocket; Parnaby, Noakes and Intwala have been promised a refund; Daniel Taylor, having been told by Time to seek legal aid, was given a refund when Consumer raised his case; Sutton's account was found to be in credit after all and is to be refunded; and Bradbeer's order has at last been cancelled. Alas for the others, we're still waiting for Time to get in touch ... No guarantee Joan Samuels of Barton-on-Sea, Hants, bought an iron last June. It developed a fault in November and the retailer replaced it under the guarantee. However, she was told that the year-long maker's guarantee did not apply to her new iron. \u0095 There is no law governing guarantees for replacement goods, says a spokesman for the Institute of Trading Standards. \"If you have a year's warranty on an item which goes wrong after 11 months, say, it is not reasonable to expect another year's warranty.\" If, however, the replacement packs up after a few months you might expect a partial refund based on the amount of use you had had from it. Burning question It is a frequently aired injustice that airlines oblige us to surrender our luggage at check-in then shrug off the blame if it is mishandled. Bruno Martelli's designer bag was returned to him with a large hole burned into it, so he rang British Airways and was told to write to customer relations. A fortnight later he received a letter advising him that there was a backlog of complaints; a fortnight after that, he had a further letter telling him that he should have addressed his woe to baggage claims, not to the address he had been given. As baggage claims needed to receive complaints within seven days and those seven days had long since elapsed, BA absolved itself of responsibility. \u0095 BA says that it has not been able to trace Martelli's records because he had not supplied a \"complaint report\" (mysteriously, this does not prevent the press office from identifying him) and had ignored three requests for one. Martelli says he never received such a request. \"He has still not provided documentation confirming the value of the luggage, but we have now accepted the claim in order not to prolong the matter further,\" says a spokeswoman. \"We've sent him \u00a370 in full settlement.\" On his bike Simon Bateson of Brentwood, Essex, checked in his new bike, dismantled, wadded and packed in a bike bag, before boarding a Virgin Express flight to Milan. At no point, he says, was he asked to sign a disclaimer notice, accepting liability if the item was damaged. He arrived safely but his bag was nowhere to be seen. When it turned up a day later, the \u00a380 bike bag was covered in footprints, the reinforced fabric was holed and the bike inside dented. Virgin promised to refer his details to its insurance company but weeks later claimed it held no responsibility for fragile or valuable items. Bateson therefore decided to claim for the bag only, but has so far met with silence. \u0095 Virgin Express points out that its conditions of carriage absolve it from responsibility for fragile, valuable, perishable or oversized luggage, although under the terms of the Warsaw Convention it pays out the splendid sum of \u00a318 per kilo (a figure arrived at in 1929, as regular Consumer readers will know) if ordinary bags are lost or damaged. \"However, something has clearly gone wrong,\" says a spokesman. \"As a goodwill gesture we'll give Mr Bateson \u00a380 to buy a new bag.\" \u0095 Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 020-7713 4731, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at consumer@theguardian.com.",

      "bodyText": "The French farming activist who last year won fame for his stand against McDonald's yesterday won a brief reprieve from an expulsion order in Brazil, where he has taken part in the destruction of genetically modified crops. Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 was arrested on Monday night for his participation in the destruction of a soya crop on Monsanto premises near southern Porto Alegre. After spending a short time in police custody he was given 24 hours to leave the country. But his lawyers yesterday succeeded in winning him habeas corpus, meaning that he was free to stay in Brazil until his flight today, when he had planned to leave anyway. The judge said the expulsion order had been \"abusive\" and represented \"mere reprisal\" by the authorities. Mr Bov\u00e9 said his activism had brought attention to the plight of Brazil's poor, rural workers: \"What happened to me is little compared to Brazil's thousands and thousands of rural poor who fight for land and are killed every day by the police and landowners.\" \"This [the expulsion order] was a political act,\" Bov\u00e9 said of the deportation order. \"It shows the will of the government to discredit those who support land reform in Brazil.\" The row marked the end of the inaugural World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, billed as the \"anti-Davos\" forum in reference to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. The Brazil forum brought together more than 9,000 people from groups opposed to unfettered economic neo-liberalism. Mr Bov\u00e9 told supporters: \"Today we are here to say we want to build a different world. If the 21st century started in Seattle, the third millennium started in Porto Alegre.\"",

      "body": "<p>The cabinet was brainstorming yesterday. For two and a half hours - a long time in cabinet politics - they talked manifesto. Radical or steady-as-she-goes? Great leap forward or trudging solid step-by-step? We wait to see if it will be a bold proclamation of Labour's true values or a third way shuffle, another nervous unfocused bid for an imaginary middle England. The truth about middle England is that like everyone everywhere, it harbours a host of pluralist contradictions, hopes and fears, generosities and meannesses, depending which way the question is put. It is for politicians to offer strong leadership and clear choices, drawing out the best of impulses, rejecting the worst. </p> <p>In all parties seasoned manifesto writers look back enviously to Margaret Thatcher's 1979 single pledge that was dazzlingly radical yet sublimely simple. It was the sale of council houses to their tenants. At a stroke a policy affecting relatively few voters struck a chord even among those who had never set foot in a council estate. It spoke eloquently of the best Conservative values: freedom from state servitude, upward aspiration for all, the Englishman's home as his castle, a property-owning democracy, concern for the respectable self-improving working class. It left Labour trapped in an old ideology that locked people into council housing for ever. It exposed Labour's dislike for upward mobility. A killer election-winner, Labour was toast. </p> <p>Every party is now seeking their magic carpet policy - the one totemic winner that conveys the essence of an entire ideology, the very best of all they stand for. As it happens, Labour had one delivered to its doorstep this week, though the cabinet yesterday may not have recognised this jewel in its palm. It is the universal right to affordable childcare. The national childcare commission, assembled by the Day Care Trust, chaired by Harriet Harman and including rightwing Tory MP Edward Leigh, came up with proposals that would transform life for families. </p> <p>\"Motherhood and apple pie,\" said one sceptic yesterday. Just so and why not? This is the apple-pie vision. Rolling out from the poorest places first, every district will have a neighbourhood children's centre to house playgroups, mother and toddler groups, a creche, a nursery, antenatal clinics, health visitors, Sure Start programmes, after-school clubs and homework clubs for older children - a home from home with all children's services in one place. Imagine a state of the art, beautiful building as a hub for the local community where parents assemble regularly, breathing new life into community activity. Isolated mothers meet here to learn and train with New Deal advisers to find them jobs. </p> <p>\"Blue sky thinking is very useful,\" said one tentative but wistful Labour minister, keen but anxious about the cost. It would be very expensive - 8,000 centres at \u00a310bn or more. Add to that the cost of the commission's other radical proposal - that every mother should be allowed to draw down the cost of childcare for the first three years, and either keep it to stay at home or spend it on a creche or childminder. Currently low-paid working mothers can claim up to \u00a370 childcare a week - a sum that could be there for all to work or not. What the commission report shows -blindingly obvious to anyone who bothered to ask - is that even mothers high up the social scale (Daily Mail middle England heartland) struggle miserably with the lack of childcare, high cost and hard to find. It causes desperate anxiety to most of the 75% of mothers who now go out to work. Commissioners listened to women cry as they reported handing over tiny babies to minders they didn't trust to go back to long hours to pay their mortgages. At the same time 65% of mothers who stay at home want to work but can't find or fund the childcare. The current system where the state subsidises anyone but the mother to care for a child makes no sense: choice is all. </p> <p>Childcare is the gaping hole in the cradle-to-grave welfare state. Like health and education it cannot be provided privately: at \u00a3180 a week it is way beyond most pockets. There is no other solution but public provision. For years the Tories tried to get employers and the private sector to do it, but it never worked. Left-behind Britain still thinks it is not the state's business, though Germany, France, Italy, Denmark and the others have had excellent nurseries for decades.

      "bodyText": "The cabinet was brainstorming yesterday. For two and a half hours - a long time in cabinet politics - they talked manifesto. Radical or steady-as-she-goes? Great leap forward or trudging solid step-by-step? We wait to see if it will be a bold proclamation of Labour's true values or a third way shuffle, another nervous unfocused bid for an imaginary middle England. The truth about middle England is that like everyone everywhere, it harbours a host of pluralist contradictions, hopes and fears, generosities and meannesses, depending which way the question is put. It is for politicians to offer strong leadership and clear choices, drawing out the best of impulses, rejecting the worst. In all parties seasoned manifesto writers look back enviously to Margaret Thatcher's 1979 single pledge that was dazzlingly radical yet sublimely simple. It was the sale of council houses to their tenants. At a stroke a policy affecting relatively few voters struck a chord even among those who had never set foot in a council estate. It spoke eloquently of the best Conservative values: freedom from state servitude, upward aspiration for all, the Englishman's home as his castle, a property-owning democracy, concern for the respectable self-improving working class. It left Labour trapped in an old ideology that locked people into council housing for ever. It exposed Labour's dislike for upward mobility. A killer election-winner, Labour was toast. Every party is now seeking their magic carpet policy - the one totemic winner that conveys the essence of an entire ideology, the very best of all they stand for. As it happens, Labour had one delivered to its doorstep this week, though the cabinet yesterday may not have recognised this jewel in its palm. It is the universal right to affordable childcare. The national childcare commission, assembled by the Day Care Trust, chaired by Harriet Harman and including rightwing Tory MP Edward Leigh, came up with proposals that would transform life for families. \"Motherhood and apple pie,\" said one sceptic yesterday. Just so and why not? This is the apple-pie vision. Rolling out from the poorest places first, every district will have a neighbourhood children's centre to house playgroups, mother and toddler groups, a creche, a nursery, antenatal clinics, health visitors, Sure Start programmes, after-school clubs and homework clubs for older children - a home from home with all children's services in one place. Imagine a state of the art, beautiful building as a hub for the local community where parents assemble regularly, breathing new life into community activity. Isolated mothers meet here to learn and train with New Deal advisers to find them jobs. \"Blue sky thinking is very useful,\" said one tentative but wistful Labour minister, keen but anxious about the cost. It would be very expensive - 8,000 centres at \u00a310bn or more. Add to that the cost of the commission's other radical proposal - that every mother should be allowed to draw down the cost of childcare for the first three years, and either keep it to stay at home or spend it on a creche or childminder. Currently low-paid working mothers can claim up to \u00a370 childcare a week - a sum that could be there for all to work or not. What the commission report shows -blindingly obvious to anyone who bothered to ask - is that even mothers high up the social scale (Daily Mail middle England heartland) struggle miserably with the lack of childcare, high cost and hard to find. It causes desperate anxiety to most of the 75% of mothers who now go out to work. Commissioners listened to women cry as they reported handing over tiny babies to minders they didn't trust to go back to long hours to pay their mortgages. At the same time 65% of mothers who stay at home want to work but can't find or fund the childcare. The current system where the state subsidises anyone but the mother to care for a child makes no sense: choice is all. Childcare is the gaping hole in the cradle-to-grave welfare state. Like health and education it cannot be provided privately: at \u00a3180 a week it is way beyond most pockets. There is no other solution but public provision. For years the Tories tried to get employers and the private sector to do it, but it never worked. Left-behind Britain still thinks it is not the state's business, though Germany, France, Italy, Denmark and the others have had excellent nurseries for decades. Founding the NHS was a monumental public good -very expensive, very daring and very popular. By promising a radical expansion of the welfare state, Labour would underline its profound belief in public services for those things that the private sector cannot do. Politically, it would trump the Tories. They plan tax incentives for marriage as their family policy. Universal children's centres would be far too expensive for them. Copying Labour spending on health and education (though for how long?), they could not pretend to follow here. A high spending, high profile promise is just what Labour needs.

      "body": "<p>The pathologist at the heart of the Alder Hey scandal may face criminal prosecution after a devastating report revealed yesterday that he had stripped the organs out of every dead child who came into his hands over a period of seven years, whether the parents had consented or not. </p> <p>Dick van Velzen, the Dutch pathologist who is already facing charges over organ storage in Canada, took the brunt of the criticism from the Redfern inquiry, which reported yesterday. He was responsible for the collection of children's body parts at the Liverpool hospital, but the hospital trust and Liverpool University, which appointed and failed to oversee him, also came in for savage criticism. </p> <p>A second report published yesterday by the chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, revealed that thousands of children and adults have had organs removed at autopsy without the knowledge of relatives, who have unsuspectingly buried incomplete bodies. </p> <p>A census of hospitals and medical schools found that at least 105,000 organs, foetuses and stillborn babies have been kept for research and education purposes. \"We need to regain a lot of public trust,\" Professor Donaldson said. \"If we don't, the benefits of teaching and research are going to be lost.\" </p> <p>The health secretary, Alan Milburn, yesterday told the Commons he was setting up an independent commission to help relatives who wanted to find and reclaim the remains of their loved ones. </p> <p>The retention of organs without full consent stemmed from a paternalism the NHS was determined to end, Mr Milburn said. Most doctors failed to broach the matter to avoid causing further grief. But what went on at Alder Hey showed the danger of assuming that the benefits of research were self-evident to all. </p> <p>\"During Van Velzen's time at Alder Hey between 1988 and 1995 he systematically ordered the illegal and unethical stripping of every organ from every child who had a postmortem,\" Mr Milburn said. </p> <p>\"He ignored parents' wishes even when they told him explicitly that they did not want a full postmortem, let alone the retention of any of their child's organs. According to the report, Van Velzen lied to parents. He lied to other doctors. He lied to hospital managers. He stole medical records. He falsified statistics and reports and he encouraged other staff to do the same.\" </p> <p>Mr Milburn slammed the hospital and Liverpool University for \"incompetence and insensitivity\" once the scandal became known. The hospital was overwhelmed by events while the university \"simply turned its back on parents\". </p> <p>Some families had to endure several funerals as body parts were returned piecemeal. </p> <p>The acting chairman of the hospital trust and two non-executive directors immediately resigned, while four NHS staff, including the chief executive, were suspended. </p> <p>Professor Van Velzen has been reported to the General Medical Council and copies of the Redfern report have been sent to Merseyside police and the director of public prosecutions. The GMC will decide on Friday whether to suspend Prof Van Velzen from practising as a doctor in Britain. He is now living in the Netherlands. </p> <p>Mr Milburn also announced a raft of radical measures. The law will be changed to ensure doctors obtain full and informed consent before the removal of organs from dead children. All hospitals will have to employ bereavement counsellors before the year's end to help and champion relatives. The home secretary has set in train a review of the coroner's system, to learn the lessons of Alder Hey and of the Shipman case. </p> <p>Yesterday Alder Hey parents demanded an apology from the hospital and Liverpool University. \"The last 17 months have been harrowing and have had a devastating effect on all the families involved,\" said Ed Bradley of the parents' support group, Pity II. </p> <p>\"The fact is that the parents have had to deal not only with the removal and retention of their child's organs but the disgraceful manner in which they have been treated.\" </p> <p>Parents said they wanted further inquiries into organ retention from the period before Prof Van Velzen took up his post. The Redfern report gave shocking details of children's heads kept in bottles from the 1960s. </p> <p>Robin Makin, solicitor for some of the families, accused the government of failing to act early enough and said the hospital had been thrown to the wolves to protect ministers. </p> <p>Philip Love, vice-chancellor of the University of Liverpool, tried to distance it from the \"quite appalling activities attributed to Prof Van Velzen\". \"The university would wish to emphasise that it had responsibility for overseeing and regulating his academic activities and not for his activities as a hospital pathologist,\" Professor Love said. </p> <p><strong>Talk about it</strong><br><a href=\"http://talk.societytheguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7e516\">Health minister live online</a><br>John Hutton was live online today.

      "bodyText": "The pathologist at the heart of the Alder Hey scandal may face criminal prosecution after a devastating report revealed yesterday that he had stripped the organs out of every dead child who came into his hands over a period of seven years, whether the parents had consented or not. Dick van Velzen, the Dutch pathologist who is already facing charges over organ storage in Canada, took the brunt of the criticism from the Redfern inquiry, which reported yesterday. He was responsible for the collection of children's body parts at the Liverpool hospital, but the hospital trust and Liverpool University, which appointed and failed to oversee him, also came in for savage criticism. A second report published yesterday by the chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, revealed that thousands of children and adults have had organs removed at autopsy without the knowledge of relatives, who have unsuspectingly buried incomplete bodies. A census of hospitals and medical schools found that at least 105,000 organs, foetuses and stillborn babies have been kept for research and education purposes. \"We need to regain a lot of public trust,\" Professor Donaldson said. \"If we don't, the benefits of teaching and research are going to be lost.\" The health secretary, Alan Milburn, yesterday told the Commons he was setting up an independent commission to help relatives who wanted to find and reclaim the remains of their loved ones. The retention of organs without full consent stemmed from a paternalism the NHS was determined to end, Mr Milburn said. Most doctors failed to broach the matter to avoid causing further grief. But what went on at Alder Hey showed the danger of assuming that the benefits of research were self-evident to all. \"During Van Velzen's time at Alder Hey between 1988 and 1995 he systematically ordered the illegal and unethical stripping of every organ from every child who had a postmortem,\" Mr Milburn said. \"He ignored parents' wishes even when they told him explicitly that they did not want a full postmortem, let alone the retention of any of their child's organs. According to the report, Van Velzen lied to parents. He lied to other doctors. He lied to hospital managers. He stole medical records. He falsified statistics and reports and he encouraged other staff to do the same.\" Mr Milburn slammed the hospital and Liverpool University for \"incompetence and insensitivity\" once the scandal became known. The hospital was overwhelmed by events while the university \"simply turned its back on parents\". Some families had to endure several funerals as body parts were returned piecemeal. The acting chairman of the hospital trust and two non-executive directors immediately resigned, while four NHS staff, including the chief executive, were suspended. Professor Van Velzen has been reported to the General Medical Council and copies of the Redfern report have been sent to Merseyside police and the director of public prosecutions. The GMC will decide on Friday whether to suspend Prof Van Velzen from practising as a doctor in Britain. He is now living in the Netherlands. Mr Milburn also announced a raft of radical measures. The law will be changed to ensure doctors obtain full and informed consent before the removal of organs from dead children. All hospitals will have to employ bereavement counsellors before the year's end to help and champion relatives. The home secretary has set in train a review of the coroner's system, to learn the lessons of Alder Hey and of the Shipman case. Yesterday Alder Hey parents demanded an apology from the hospital and Liverpool University. \"The last 17 months have been harrowing and have had a devastating effect on all the families involved,\" said Ed Bradley of the parents' support group, Pity II. \"The fact is that the parents have had to deal not only with the removal and retention of their child's organs but the disgraceful manner in which they have been treated.\" Parents said they wanted further inquiries into organ retention from the period before Prof Van Velzen took up his post. The Redfern report gave shocking details of children's heads kept in bottles from the 1960s. Robin Makin, solicitor for some of the families, accused the government of failing to act early enough and said the hospital had been thrown to the wolves to protect ministers. Philip Love, vice-chancellor of the University of Liverpool, tried to distance it from the \"quite appalling activities attributed to Prof Van Velzen\". \"The university would wish to emphasise that it had responsibility for overseeing and regulating his academic activities and not for his activities as a hospital pathologist,\" Professor Love said.

The head of News Corporation is willing to launch a stripped-down version of his satellite TV company on the market. However, he still hopes to give Sky Global a US foothold. Mr Murdoch is still negotiating the acquisition of DirecTV from owner General Motors. But he is determined this will not delay the flotation of Sky Global Networks beyond the summer. \"We are talking to satellite broadcasters, including DirecTV in the US, and one option for us is to merge our satellite interests with a publicly listed company such as DirecTV,\" said a News Corp spokesman. \"But if that does not happen, we will not be perfectly happy to go ahead and list Sky Global, which is all of our existing global satellite assets.\" The existing satellite TV assets of News Corp include 38% of BSkyB, 100% of Asian broadcaster Star TV and 50% of Italian station Stream. But if Mr Murdoch cannot clinch a deal with DirecTV, he still intends to press ahead with the float. \"It will just not be a US company,\" said the spokesman. \"We would prefer to have a US satellite presence but it is not essential to the success of Sky Global.\" Pressure is piling on Mr Murdoch to produce some good news for shareholders in time for results announcements for News Corp and BSkyB next week. Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen has warned News Corp will be hit by a marked slump in ad revenue in the US market, where it makes 70% of its revenues. Negotiations for the sale of DirecTV and its holding company, Hughes Electrics, are ongoing, with General Motors denying reports that News Corp has fallen in the pecking order of bidders. The News Corp spokesman said the much-delayed flotation of Sky Global was still planned for the beginning of the year. The slimline Sky Global would then float on a volatile US market, which is unlikely to react favourably to the lack of a north American presence. However, plans to launch Sky Global in its existing form throw the spotlight onto French media giant Vivendi Universal, which is selling its 22.7% stake in BSkyB. Vivendi boss Jean-Marie Messier said he was in no hurry to sell the \u00a34.4bn holding. But he does not want to sour his already fractious relationship with Mr Murdoch. The future of the BSkyB stake must be settled if Sky Global is to be floated with the UK digital and satellite broadcaster as its centrepiece instead of DirecTV. US cable company Liberty Media, which has a 20% interest in News Corp, is the favourite to acquire the holding. Relevant stories Jan 29: News Corp in running for DirecTV stake",

      "body": "<p>Imagine a world in which every business is responsible for its own telecommunications system. Not just for paying the bill, but for buying, installing, arranging a maintenance contract and operating the telephone systems. Add to this the notion that every company would have to take care of its own money; there would be no banks, just a mattress in the managing director's office into which numerous fivers would be sewn.</p> <p>The ideas sound ludicrous, yet this is exactly what the vast majority of companies do with their computer installations, which can be equally complex. It is into this space that the application service provider (ASP) has emerged. The idea is straightforward enough: the customer pays to have all of their applications and information on an ASP's system, which they access via the internet (see box below). It started in the corporate world but stalled somewhat, as Butler Group's director of research Mike Thompson explains: \"We always said we didn't feel that size of organisation would be happy to have their applications and their data outside their direct control.\" In addition to this, although there are cost savings to be had from the ASP idea, most if not all blue-chip companies already had their IT under the management of in-house specialists.</p> <p>Clearly, the same was not true of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These organisations, previously denied the analytical power of such high-end offerings as Walker's financial systems, were suddenly able to rent time on these sorts of systems without having to buy the servers or configure the systems. Maybe it is a little odd, then, that the market still hasn't really taken off.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons for this, the first of which is likely to be the sheer conservatism of SME managers. In most cases an attempt at selling them the idea of farming their technology out to a third party will meet with a blank stare and a question as to why they should spend time and money fixing their systems when basically they work. </p> <p>There is also the issue of trust. \"My advice to ASPs is to get some sturdy systems and service level agreements in place. The ones that do this have the upper hand as they're ensuring customers get value for money,\" says Simon Robinson, Europe, Middle East and Africa marketing manager at e-commerce infrastructure specialist NetIQ.</p> <p>Other companies - mostly ASPs themselves that have vested interests - have commissioned independent research on why the ASP model isn't capturing people's imagination. Interliant, for example, found five major reasons for using ASPs: the cost/headcount ratio improved; technical support was good; skill shortages were largely eliminated; implementation was fast, and the service level agreement - the document guaranteeing a certain standard of performance - was better than most internal IT departments could offer. The reasons people weren't using the services included already having a tailor-made system in place, already having the right skills in-house, and a feeling that the applications were already managed properly in-house. \"What was most interesting from the research was the disparity between difficulties expected when using an ASP from those actually experienced,\" says David Yuile, Interliant UK managing director. \"For example, while only 15% of respondents expected that there would 'no problems' at all if they used an ASP, an enormous 46% reported there actually being 'no problems' when they did use an ASP.\"</p> <p>Perceptions are not the only inhibitor. Everything an ASP does will be delivered via an internet connection, and in the UK a constant, reliable connection is not cheap - leased lines, which are among the most reliable forms of connection, start at \u00a33,000 per annum, and it is worth repeating that ASPs at the moment are asking their customers to replace an internal system which is basically working.</p> <p>Nevertheless, many analysts believe ASPs will become increasingly important, and the market is already showing signs of segmenting to fuel that growth. International Data Corporation is forecasting an ASP market worth \u00a3480 million by 2004, and many large software companies are developing a strategy in which their products can be delivered in this way. Sean O'Reilly, vice-president of marketing for ASP Netstore, says: \"The implementation of an ASP strategy by some of the world's largest software vendors - for example, Microsoft, Sun and Oracle - demonstrates that this software delivery method is increasingly seen as a business reality.\" </p> <p>The segmentation is evident in the emergence of the Internet Business Services initiative (IBSi). A spokeswoman explains: \"The mission of the IBSi is to separate its members from 'traditional' ASPs, which it believes are simply retro-fitting expensive, cumbersome, packaged software for the internet as opposed to developing applications from the ground up for delivery over the web.\"</p> <p>Whatever the truth of this, ASPs are showing signs of growth in certain markets. John Wilmott, managing director of analyst NelsonHall, suggests the business hasn't grown as quickly as the early predictions had suggested. He points to the difficulties in offering a 'one-to-many' (one ASP host with many clients) service for businesses when they actually want a more tailored service. There are two areas in which he suggests there will be faster than average growth, though: \"The best opportunities for one-to-many remain in areas close to the IT infrastructure such as traditional ISP services, back-ups and so on,\" he says. \"Start-ups are more likely to buy ASP services than established organisations since they require cost-effective speed to market and have less of a business process history.\"</p> <p>The idea of importing a specialist to handle complex technical problems must- as long as it is done right - ultimately make sense. The difficulty facing ASPs is to persuade a market used to hype and hollow acronyms that they can offer a service of genuine value.</p> <p><strong>What is an ASP?</strong></p> <p>An application service provider (ASP) will tell you the service they offer is brand new, but this is not absolutely true. We've been here before, from 1960s-style 'bureaux' to 'outsourcing partners' with high-flying corporate clients. In many ways there is little difference between outsourcing - in which a company pays an independent company to send staff to install, maintain and manage systems and remain on site in lieu of support staff - and an ASP. The key difference is that the ASP's work takes place on its own site.</p> <p>An ASP at its most basic is an organisation that rents space on its computer systems, into which customers can dial and access their applications - everything from a word processor to a complex suite of financial applications can be run independently through a web browser.</p> <p>There are many advantages in this. Smaller businesses have access to business tools they would otherwise not have. Lotus Notes, hitherto aimed at the corporate environment, requires dedicated computers called servers to run and staff dedicated to its management. <br>The financial outlay required is reduced because the ASP will be handling more than one company's systems. Fewer software licences are needed because users will only dial into, for example, the accounting system when they need it rather than running effectively redundant copies on different workstations.</p> <p>Many software systems companies have responded to the emergence of ASPs by offering cut-down versions of their systems. Enterprise resource planning organisations - the likes of SAP, which makes an integrated manufacturing, distribution and financial application - typically took months if not years to configure their systems correctly. Now, elements of it can be rented from an ASP with vastly reduced set-up time and costs.</p> <p>The idea also carries a number of negative points, though more psychological than technical and involving the security of an ASP's system and the soundness of the ASP's business. Most small businesses regard their customer data as their main asset and the idea of storing that information on someone else's computer can be problematic. Many analysts are convinced the advantages outweigh the drawbacks and the business as a concept will succeed. However, John Serle, chair of the Society of IT Management's best practice committee, remains unconvinced. \"The problem before with the model was that providers relied on a return on investment period that proved unrealistic. In today's volatile IT market this is likely to be even more of a challenge,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>EquIP gets back to basics</strong></p> <p>EquIP was established last year to supply internet infrastructure products, usually through channel partners. When the company was set up it intended to sell to application service providers (ASPs) as well as other organisations. For consistency, therefore, it elected to farm all its computer applications and infrastructure out to London-based ASP Pasporte. <br>The impetus to use an ASP came partly from the need to save money but also to prevent problems arising when the company needed to grow - if someone else was responsible for networking and other technical infrastructure as the company grew, the company itself could concentrate on its core business.</p> <p>Joint managing director Neil Ledger says EquIP has been delighted with the results so far. \"The financial director in particular is pleased because we're using systems we couldn't have had otherwise,\" he says. The complete system includes a Sage accountancy system, Business Objects intelligence software and Lotus Notes Domino for messaging and web services.

It is into this space that the application service provider (ASP) has emerged. The idea is straightforward enough: the customer pays to have all of their applications and information on an ASP's system, which they access via the internet (see box below). It started in the corporate world but stalled somewhat, as Butler Group's director of research Mike Thompson explains: \"We always said we didn't feel that size of organisation would be happy to have their applications and their data outside their direct control.\" In addition to this, although there are cost savings to be had from the ASP idea, most if not all blue-chip companies already had their IT under the management of in-house specialists. Clearly, the same was not true of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These organisations, previously denied the analytical power of such high-end offerings as Walker's financial systems, were suddenly able to rent time on these sorts of systems without having to buy the servers or configure the systems. Maybe it is a little odd, then, that the market still hasn't really taken off. There are a number of reasons for this, the first of which is likely to be the sheer conservatism of SME managers. In most cases an attempt at selling them the idea of farming their technology out to a third party will meet with a blank stare and a question as to why they should spend time and money fixing their systems when basically they work. There is also the issue of trust. \"My advice to ASPs is to get some sturdy systems and service level agreements in place. The ones that do this have the upper hand as they're ensuring customers get value for money,\" says Simon Robinson, Europe, Middle East and Africa marketing manager at e-commerce infrastructure specialist NetIQ. Other companies - mostly ASPs themselves that have vested interests - have commissioned independent research on why the ASP model isn't capturing people's imagination. Interliant, for example, found five major reasons for using ASPs: the cost/headcount ratio improved; technical support was good; skill shortages were largely eliminated; implementation was fast, and the service level agreement - the document guaranteeing a certain standard of performance - was better than most internal IT departments could offer. The reasons people weren't using the services included already having a tailor-made system in place, already having the right skills in-house, and a feeling that the applications were already managed properly in-house. \"What was most interesting from the research was the disparity between difficulties expected when using an ASP from those actually experienced,\" says David Yuile, Interliant UK managing director. \"For example, while only 15% of respondents expected that there would 'no problems' at all if they used an ASP, an enormous 46% reported there actually being 'no problems' when they did use an ASP.\" Perceptions are not the only inhibitor. Everything an ASP does will be delivered via an internet connection, and in the UK a constant, reliable connection is not cheap - leased lines, which are among the most reliable forms of connection, start at \u00a33,000 per annum, and it is worth repeating that ASPs at the moment are asking their customers to replace an internal system which is basically working. Nevertheless, many analysts believe ASPs will become increasingly important, and the market is already showing signs of segmenting to fuel that growth. International Data Corporation is forecasting an ASP market worth \u00a3480 million by 2004, and many large software companies are developing a strategy in which their products can be delivered in this way. Sean O'Reilly, vice-president of marketing for ASP Netstore, says: \"The implementation of an ASP strategy by some of the world's largest software vendors - for example, Microsoft, Sun and Oracle - demonstrates that this software delivery method is increasingly seen as a business reality.\" The segmentation is evident in the emergence of the Internet Business Services initiative (IBSi). A spokeswoman explains: \"The mission of the IBSi is to separate its members from 'traditional' ASPs, which it believes are simply retro-fitting expensive, cumbersome, packaged software for the internet as opposed to developing applications from the ground up for delivery over the web.\" Whatever the truth of this, ASPs are showing signs of growth in certain markets. John Wilmott, managing director of analyst NelsonHall, suggests the business hasn't grown as quickly as the early predictions had suggested. He points to the difficulties in offering a 'one-to-many' (one ASP host with many clients) service for businesses when they actually want a more tailored service. There are two areas in which he suggests there will be faster than average growth, though: \"The best opportunities for one-to-many remain in areas close to the IT infrastructure such as traditional ISP services, back-ups and so on,\" he says. \"Start-ups are more likely to buy ASP services than established organisations since they require cost-effective speed to market and have less of a business process history.\" The idea of importing a specialist to handle complex technical problems must- as long as it is done right - ultimately make sense. The difficulty facing ASPs is to persuade a market used to hype and hollow acronyms that they can offer a service of genuine value. What is an ASP? An application service provider (ASP) will tell you the service they offer is brand new, but this is not absolutely true. We've been here before, from 1960s-style 'bureaux' to 'outsourcing partners' with high-flying corporate clients. In many ways there is little difference between outsourcing - in which a company pays an independent company to send staff to install, maintain and manage systems and remain on site in lieu of support staff - and an ASP. The key difference is that the ASP's work takes place on its own site. An ASP at its most basic is an organisation that rents space on its computer systems, into which customers can dial and access their applications - everything from a word processor to a complex suite of financial applications can be run independently through a web browser. There are many advantages in this. Smaller businesses have access to business tools they would otherwise not have. Lotus Notes, hitherto aimed at the corporate environment, requires dedicated computers called servers to run and staff dedicated to its management. The financial outlay required is reduced because the ASP will be handling more than one company's systems. Fewer software licences are needed because users will only dial into, for example, the accounting system when they need it rather than running effectively redundant copies on different workstations. Many software systems companies have responded to the emergence of ASPs by offering cut-down versions of their systems. Enterprise resource planning organisations - the likes of SAP, which makes an integrated manufacturing, distribution and financial application - typically took months if not years to configure their systems correctly. Now, elements of it can be rented from an ASP with vastly reduced set-up time and costs. The idea also carries a number of negative points, though more psychological than technical and involving the security of an ASP's system and the soundness of the ASP's business. Most small businesses regard their customer data as their main asset and the idea of storing that information on someone else's computer can be problematic. Many analysts are convinced the advantages outweigh the drawbacks and the business as a concept will succeed. However, John Serle, chair of the Society of IT Management's best practice committee, remains unconvinced. \"The problem before with the model was that providers relied on a return on investment period that proved unrealistic. In today's volatile IT market this is likely to be even more of a challenge,\" he says. EquIP gets back to basics EquIP was established last year to supply internet infrastructure products, usually through channel partners. When the company was set up it intended to sell to application service providers (ASPs) as well as other organisations. For consistency, therefore, it elected to farm all its computer applications and infrastructure out to London-based ASP Pasporte. The impetus to use an ASP came partly from the need to save money but also to prevent problems arising when the company needed to grow - if someone else was responsible for networking and other technical infrastructure as the company grew, the company itself could concentrate on its core business. Joint managing director Neil Ledger says EquIP has been delighted with the results so far. \"The financial director in particular is pleased because we're using systems we couldn't have had otherwise,\" he says. The complete system includes a Sage accountancy system, Business Objects intelligence software and Lotus Notes Domino for messaging and web services. Pasporte installed the systems over a weekend and included remote diagnostic and monitoring tools so that if a problem arises it can be fixed without a site visit wherever possible, taking the maintenance task away from EquIP altogether. Security and constant availability are crucial in an agreement like this, so one of the first things EquIP did was to inspect Pasporte's equipment; as a company with a background it knew what to look for to gain reassurance. The other issue the company considered important was the paperwork. \"We have a written service level agreement,\" says Ledger. This outlines how the service works and what the compensation will be if it fails. The end result is that EquIP has the use of systems that would normally be associated with far larger businesses, with none of the expense or time of maintaining and upgrading it. The costs are per user and per month, so the charges will be entirely predictable.",

His mother described his appearance as horrible. </p> <p>Subsequently, at a Foundation of Infant Deaths conference, they met Professor Van Velzen, who had carried out the postmortem examination. He said that Phillip's organs were normal and there was no explanation for his death. He said it was \"rather like buying a light bulb and the shop testing it before taking it home yet when the bulb was fitted at home it failed\". </p> <p>Phillip's twin was detained in hospital on and off for three months and underwent very extensive, distressing tests. In the end there was no obvious conclusion. </p> <p>In December 1999 his parents discovered that Phillip's organs had been retained. Initially they were told of partial retention, from brain to reproductive organs. A second burial took place in January 2000. It had always been their desire to bury their child intact. </p> <p>They now feel that they were told lies by Alder Hey in December 1999. This has left them with concerns about whether Phillip's other organs have been used for pharmaceutical research and whether his eyes were removed. They were incredulous at the retention of his reproductive organs and this in itself raised their suspicion. </p> <p>Their overriding concern is why the organs were retained. If some useful research had been carried out it might have comforted them. </p> <p><b> Kathryn (15 years)</b><br> </p> <p> Kathryn had Hodgkin's disease and died at Alder Hey in 1993. Less than one hour after her death the clinician asked for permission for a postmortem examination. </p> <p>Her parents were told that small tissue samples only would be taken, through a restricted incision, from the lung, liver and kidney. </p> <p>They consented to a limited postmortem examination and signed a handwritten consent form which read as follows: \"We, the parents of Kathryn, give permission for removal of tissue for diagnostic and other purposes other than transplantation.\" </p> <p>Before her death, Kathryn had been deteriorating under her chemotherapy regime for more than seven weeks. On 19, 20, 22 and 23 August 1993 Kathryn and her parents requested that she be allowed home but this was refused. </p> <p>Her parents feel that had she been allowed home she would not have been stripped of her organs and she would have been buried with respect and dignity. </p> <p>On 8 December 1999, her parents were informed by Alder Hey that Kathryn's heart, chest and abdomen organs had been retained. </p> <p>On 20 December 1999 they received a letter from Hilary Rowland, the chief executive at Alder Hey, indicating that the heart, lung, liver, spleen and kidneys had been retained. The parents remain concerned that other organs may have been retained. They do not trust the management at Alder Hey. </p> <p>Their view is that parents are generous when a child dies. Even now they want to make things better. They do not want others to go through what they have been through. </p> <p><b> Ross (5 months)</b><br> </p> <p> Ross was born prematurely at 27 weeks and died in 1990 at Liverpool maternity hospital. The cause of his death was cardio-respiratory arrest consequent upon chronic lung disease. </p> <p>His parents consented to a postmortem examination to determine the cause of death if it would help other children who had the same disease. No steps were taken to explain the consent form to them. </p> <p>They were never told that whole organs would be removed and retained. They thought they had buried their son intact whereas in fact they buried a husk. They insist on the need for fully informed consent. </p> <p>In November 1999 the whole of Ross's organs were returned by Alder Hey and buried. As they interred the organs they discovered that the casket bore the inscription for a child of four years, two months yet Ross was only five months old when he died. This caused additional unneccessary grief. His parents are angry that there was never any discussion following death of the desire or intention to retain organs. Had they been asked for retention of the heart and lungs to investigate chronic lung disease they would have agreed. </p> <p><b> Claire (14 years)</b><br> </p> <p> Claire died in 1988 from a paracetamol overdose. There was a coroner's postmortem and an inquest. Her parents thought they had had buried their daughter's remains intact, they were not told that organs would be retained. However, they say their treatment at Alder Hey at the time of the loss was extremely sensitive and sympathetic. </p> <p>This is an unusual case. The usual attempt at justification for organ retention is not applicable. It cannot have been to assist with research into infant mortal ity because Claire was almost 15 when she died. It cannot have been to assist research into congenital heart disease because her heart was strong. </p> <p>There cannot be any justification for stockpiling organs awaiting final postmortem reports. Her parents have not been given any explanation as to why Claire's organs were retained and were not told why the postmortem examination was carried out. </p> <p>Her father says he thinks everyone has a right to lay the dead to rest. It is a critical right because it is part of the grieving process. It is doubly important with the loss of a child because that in itself is an obscenity of nature.

      "body": "<p>The BBC is close to signing a deal with the heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis, bolstering the corporation's plan to restore its reputation as a serious challenger for the rights over leading sports. </p> <p>The agreement, which could mean the boxer being paid up to \u00a31m a fight, signals the return of top-flight boxing to the BBC. The corporation will screen its first heavyweight title clash for more than a decade when Lewis meets the little known US fighter, Hasim Rahman, in April. </p> <p>But the real prize will be the expected contest against Mike Tyson, likely to take place later this year. </p> <p>The deal lures Lewis from Rupert Murdoch's Sky, which has held the rights to screen the fighter's matches for the past seven years. </p> <p>In recent weeks the BBC has demonstrated its ability to go a few rounds with Mr Murdoch. Ten days ago it announced a 10-fight package to screen bouts featuring the Olympic gold medallist Audley Harrison, who makes his professional debut in the next few months. </p> <p>BBC chiefs have also held \"exploratory talks\" with the featherweight title-holder, Naseem Hamed, who has only two fights left before his Sky deal ends. </p> <p>Yesterday, a Sky spokesman confirmed Lewis's next bout would be on the BBC. \"We've enjoyed some memorable times with Lennox, particularly the two Evander Holyfield fights, and wish him continued success,\" he said. </p> <p>The aim of the BBC's director general, Greg Dyke, is to rebuild a presence in sport after competition from rival broadcasters over a decade with bigger budgets. The BBC's position was gradually eroded. It lost rights to England's home test matches in cricket, England home rugby union matches, and Grand Prix motor racing. The worst humiliation was the loss of Match of the Day to ITV after 36 years. </p> <p>Mr Dyke now appears to be building a bridgehead in boxing, which regularly drew audiences of 15m to 18m in the 1980s. The last world heavy weight fight screened by the corporation was Frank Bruno losing to Mike Tyson in 1989. Mr Dyke, a former boxing journalist, is close to the promoter Frank Warren from his days at ITV and could tempt him back to the corporation as well. </p> <p>The BBC also signed a deal to broadcast the World Amateur Boxing Championships in Belfast in June, and the Four Nations ABA tournament in Liverpool in April. </p> <p>The choice for Lewis was not straightforward maths. The BBC may be offering less cash upfront but higher audience figures can mean better sponsorship deals. Like Harrison, Lennox is also keen for the higher profile of the BBC which has built longevity into the careers of Frank Bruno and Chris Eubank. </p> <p>At 35, Lennox is nearing the end of his career and will be eager to increase his job prospects. Sky, which shows big fights on a pay-per-view basis, generally musters between only 200,000 and 300,000 viewers. </p> <p>Sporting events are at the forefront of attempts to win in the ratings war and their value has escalated almost exponentially in recent years. Last summer, the live rights to football's Premiership went to Sky for \u00a31.11bn, for a three-year package starting this autumn. In 1986, the last year of the BBC and ITV cartel, the rights to the then First Division were sold for just \u00a33.1m a year. </p> <p>The BBC has been fighting back on several fronts. It has won the FA Cup and England's home internationals in football, as well as agreed a \u00a342m deal to keep the Premiership on Radio 5 Live for the next three years. It is planning a standalone sports channel, thought to be in partnership with cable firm NTL. </p> <p>\u0095 Paul Ingle, who suffered a brain blood clot during his featherweight title bout against South Africa's Mbulelo Botile last month, is recovering in a rehabilitation centre near his home, it was disclosed yesterday. A spokesman for the Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield said Ingle, 28, had made good progress.</p>",

The BBC's position was gradually eroded. It lost rights to England's home test matches in cricket, England home rugby union matches, and Grand Prix motor racing. The worst humiliation was the loss of Match of the Day to ITV after 36 years. Mr Dyke now appears to be building a bridgehead in boxing, which regularly drew audiences of 15m to 18m in the 1980s. The last world heavy weight fight screened by the corporation was Frank Bruno losing to Mike Tyson in 1989. Mr Dyke, a former boxing journalist, is close to the promoter Frank Warren from his days at ITV and could tempt him back to the corporation as well. The BBC also signed a deal to broadcast the World Amateur Boxing Championships in Belfast in June, and the Four Nations ABA tournament in Liverpool in April. The choice for Lewis was not straightforward maths. The BBC may be offering less cash upfront but higher audience figures can mean better sponsorship deals. Like Harrison, Lennox is also keen for the higher profile of the BBC which has built longevity into the careers of Frank Bruno and Chris Eubank. At 35, Lennox is nearing the end of his career and will be eager to increase his job prospects. Sky, which shows big fights on a pay-per-view basis, generally musters between only 200,000 and 300,000 viewers. Sporting events are at the forefront of attempts to win in the ratings war and their value has escalated almost exponentially in recent years. Last summer, the live rights to football's Premiership went to Sky for \u00a31.11bn, for a three-year package starting this autumn. In 1986, the last year of the BBC and ITV cartel, the rights to the then First Division were sold for just \u00a33.1m a year. The BBC has been fighting back on several fronts. It has won the FA Cup and England's home internationals in football, as well as agreed a \u00a342m deal to keep the Premiership on Radio 5 Live for the next three years. It is planning a standalone sports channel, thought to be in partnership with cable firm NTL. \u0095 Paul Ingle, who suffered a brain blood clot during his featherweight title bout against South Africa's Mbulelo Botile last month, is recovering in a rehabilitation centre near his home, it was disclosed yesterday. A spokesman for the Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield said Ingle, 28, had made good progress.",

      "body": "<p>When the health department published its second set of social care performance indicators in October last year, the key word was clarity. Explaining the introduction of its new banding system in a letter to council managers, social care minister John Hutton said the bands in the performance assessment framework answered \"concerns raised last year about the ease of interpretation for those not expert in handling data\". Councillors, users, carers, managers and the public, he says, would all be able to \"better understand and question the performance of their local social services\". </p> <p>And what is clear, according to the indicators for 1999-2000, is that things are getting better. More than 120 of the 150 councils with responsibilities for social services showed improvements against 50% or more of the indicators. </p> <p>So far so good. But the message becomes somewhat confused when you look at other official sources of information on the care provided by social services departments. Hutton says the in-depth joint review reports on individual departments, undertaken by the social services inspectorate and the audit commission, back up the view that social services are getting better overall, but the reports' findings on some councils seem to be at odds with their performance as measured by the indicators. </p> <p>Take Derbyshire county council, for instance. The performance assessment framework rated it one of the three best social services departments in England, along with Redbridge, in east London, and Derby. It was found to provide services of an \"acceptable\", \"good\" or \"very good\" quality on 30 of the 37 performance measures. Yet the assessment of the joint review team found that its services were patchy, with only some people being served well. </p> <p>\"Despite Derbyshire's sound reputation for innovation,\" the assessment concluded, \"it has failed to provide a level of consistency which benefits all local residents.\" </p> <p>Or look at Redbridge. The joint review's conclusion? \"Redbridge council is having some difficulty in providing adequate social services to all its residents.\" So much for clarity. </p> <p>The mixed messages continue at the other end of the table. West Berkshire was one of six councils named by the health department as causing concern, as they earned ratings of \"investigate urgently\" or \"ask questions about performance\" in more than half the 37 indicators. Yet the headline message from its joint review was far from damning, concluding that the council provides good social services to some people and has excellent prospects for improvement. </p> <p>What is going on? From an administration that has made joined-up government its holy grail, this seems a poor start to the crusade. </p> <p>Birmingham city council was the subject of a highly critical joint review last summer. The findings were not disputed by the authority, and its director of social services, Sandra Taylor, who arrived at Birmingham just prior to the review team's visit at the end of 1999, has set in motion a series of changes aimed at addressing many of the problems. But looking at the performance assessment framework, you'd hardly get the idea that this was a department struggling with major difficulties in performance. </p> <p>\"While there is a spread in our performance assessment framework indicators, you'd think that we are a relatively OK department,\" says Taylor, although she accepts that the framework does raise questions about unit costs and child protection registrations. \"The performance assessment framework is meant to help the public understand a service,\" she says. \"But, on the face of it, in Birmingham the framework and the joint review tell different stories.\" </p> <p>Derbyshire's social services director, Bruce Buckley, admits that there were mixed messages coming out of the county's joint review and its performance assessment ratings. And although he says this hasn't led to local confusion among the public, it did lead to staff being told one week that they are good at keeping people at home, for instance, only to be told the next week that they lack consistency in performance. \"The intention is that the two systems should be complementary,\" he said. \"But they haven't got to that stage yet.\" </p> <p>It may just be at headline level that confusion arises. Redbridge, for instance, says there is a lot of consistency in the detail of both assessment systems. For instance, its joint review highlighted the performance of its registration and inspection unit as demonstrating good practice, which fits with its 100% top band score in the relevant performance indicator. </p> <p>Given the health department's insistence that indicators \"only indicate\" and should not be used by themselves to judge performance, it was perhaps a poor decision to go public on the so-called best and worst performers under the performance frame- work. For a start, high scores in some indicators, earning the top banding of \"very good\", are not necessarily an indication of good performance. </p> <p>\"The performance assessment framework is not a test, and getting top marks doesn't mean you are a good authority,\" says Moira Gibb, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS). \"It is about telling you where questions need to be asked.\" Although she believes the assessment framework is helpful, she says the pursuit of a high score on a particular indicator could be counter productive. </p> <p>For instance, one indicator measures the number of re-registrations on the child protection register. In general, to do well on this indicator a council needs to keep the number of re-registrations down. \"To score well on this indicator might indicate good performance in ensuring children are well supported and safe, or it could mean children are left on the register when they could come off,\" says Gibb. </p> <p>On the other hand, a good authority can be characterised by active management of the register, which may increase the number of re-registrations. But this good practice could earn a low score. \"Other indicators of performance are needed to get a true picture of an authority,\" Gibb says. </p> <p>\"With the performance assessment framework and other performance tools, the overall mechanisms are evolving,\" says Tony Hunter, social services director of East Riding of Yorkshire unitary council and chair of the ADSS standards and performance committee. \"The assessment framework is not without its problems and the Department of Health knows that.\" But he admits that the current system can be confusing. \"Sometimes there are risks that different messages are given out,\" he says. To counter this, he believes councils need to work with the local media to ensure the public get an honest view of how a department is performing. </p> <p>John Bolton, director of joint reviews, is clearly uncomfortable with the idea of turning the indicators into league tables of overall performance. For a start, choosing a different set of indicators - and there is a bewildering amount of data collected on social care that could produce countless different indicators - could reveal a different overall picture of an authority. </p> <p>He also says that the reliability of the data being used has to be recognised. Derbyshire's joint review report pointed to the absence of a \"robust and reliable management information system\". Yet it is this flawed system that will have provided the data for the performance indicators which show Derbyshire as one of the top three councils for social care. While he believes the indicators are an important step forward, he feels they need to be looked at in context. </p> <p>Bolton accepts that the public could be confused by the seeming contradiction between some councils' performance under the assessment framework and the findings of their joint reviews at least in the headlines that they generate. But he believes help may be at hand. The health department has this month kicked off a series of performance assessment meetings with individual social services departments. </p> <p>\"The Department of Health draws all the sources of information about an authority together - including its joint review, any inspections of services, general inquiries dealt with by the regional office and the management information - and then shares with the authority what it believes are the key messages,\" says Bolton. </p> <p>This could lead to a single judgment about an authority. If that can be done and an unambiguous assessment of a council's performance in social care can be derived and, importantly, made public, the clarity and better understanding promised by the health minister may indeed be delivered. </p> <p><strong>When praise rings hollow</strong></p> <p>Criticism of Haringey social services in the tragic case of Anna Climbie, the eight-year-old tortured and killed by her carers, stands in sharp contrast to the very positive findings of the joint review of the north London authority. </p> <p>According to the review report, published in November 1999, the people of Haringey are generally well served by social services and the department is well managed and modernising impressively.

It provides information on the Mr Kipling product range, activities, games and consumer feedback. It will also have an area dedicated to the brand's sponsorship of this year's Comic Relief fundraising effort. The website address will appear on all packaging, promotions and ads. \"We want to give consumers the greatest access to the brand,\" said Mr Kipling brand manager Hazel Cawthorne. \"The Mr Kipling website has been established to give the brand a modern, confident face. \"We want to make Mr Kipling more accessible and responsive to consumers.\"",

While there's nothing in the Human Rights Act to stop this happening, I have grave reservations that effectively untrained people are going to be involved in the collection of evidence, which will result in more errors than are presently made, and more guilty people walking free.\"</p> <p>Superintendent Martin Abbott, divisional commander for north and west Wiltshire, said that far from making the system error-ridden it would prevent time wasting.</p> <p>He said: \"It has never been done before in this way and we hope it will make the system slicker and more efficient. The scheme will give the visible representations of the police that people require so much.</p> <p>\"It will release them to operational duties outside.

      "bodyText": "Civilians are set to interview crime suspects in a controversial new scheme to free more officers on to the beat. The Wiltshire police project is thought to be the first of its kind in western Europe, but has been criticised by the Police Federation which said it raised serious concerns about using civilians in such a specialised role. Under the system the new prisoner handling team investigators will mainly deal with \"bulk\" offences such as criminal damage and theft although police chiefs have not ruled out the possibility that they could handle more delicate interviews for rape and murder cases. As well as interviewing suspects, their duties will include taking fingerprints, processing description forms and preparing a file on the offender for the crown prosecution service. But civil rights lawyer Mark Stephens, of Finers Stephens Innocent, branded the scheme \"policing on the cheap\" saying it sacrificed quality for price. \"Trained police officers are uniquely placed to conduct a proper forensic examination to comply with the law when they do it,\" said Mr Stephens. \"Civilians, however well intentioned, are going to be nothing more than interfering do-gooders. While there's nothing in the Human Rights Act to stop this happening, I have grave reservations that effectively untrained people are going to be involved in the collection of evidence, which will result in more errors than are presently made, and more guilty people walking free.\" Superintendent Martin Abbott, divisional commander for north and west Wiltshire, said that far from making the system error-ridden it would prevent time wasting. He said: \"It has never been done before in this way and we hope it will make the system slicker and more efficient. The scheme will give the visible representations of the police that people require so much. \"It will release them to operational duties outside. It is quite a challenge for us in an area where police officers are traditionally seen as the only ones who can do the work. \"I have every confidence it will be successful and will be extended elsewhere. If it is not effective we will not continue with it.\" The two-year pilot scheme is being run in a division, which takes in Ashton Keynes and Codford, near Warminster. Three police officers will be backed by five civilians, based at the divisional headquarters in Chippenham. After an arrest, officers will book suspects in as usual but will then hand them over to the prisoner handling scheme. It is hoped that the scheme will reduce the time officers spend preparing paperwork and waiting for solicitors. The job advertisement in local newspapers reads: \"This is a new initiative and an exciting opportunity for civilian members to join the Constabulary in a supportive role. \"Interviewing skills as well as an enquiring mind, a methodical approach to work and the ability to work to deadlines are essential.\" The force already employs civilians as investigation assistants - who take witness statements - and the scheme is seen as an extension of that. However, PC Philip Davenport, spokesman for the Wiltshire branch of the Police Federation, said: \"My first concern is this is the first time it has happened anywhere in the country. \"There may be issues which have not been researched. I would hope the people who the police employ do have the appropriate skills. \"Those officers going on to CID, who investigate serious crimes, hone their skills through interviewing suspects throughout their service.\" The Home Office said: \"How any individual chief constable deploys officers is entirely a matter for the chief constable and is an operational decision for the police force.\"",

The scene is postwar Vienna, shadowy and bare in Robert Krasner's Oscar-winning black-and-white photography, Anton Karas's zither a melancholy accompaniment. Welles's Harry Lime is a marvellously cynical flourish, presumed dead but found alive and thriving as a black marketeer by loyal old pal Joseph Cotten. The wonderful cast includes Trevor Howard, Bernard Lee and Wilfrid Hyde-White, all stamping redundant British values on central Europe. </p> <p><strong> Lust For Life</strong> <br><strong>(Vincente Minnelli, 1956)</strong><br><strong> 9pm, TCM</strong></p> <p> An intense and dedicated performance from Kirk Douglas drives this unusually astute biopic about Vincent Van Gogh.

      "bodyText": "Films The Third Man (Carol Reed, 1949) 8pm, FilmFour Reed's classic thriller, born out of an elite collaboration with Graham Greene and Orson Welles. The scene is postwar Vienna, shadowy and bare in Robert Krasner's Oscar-winning black-and-white photography, Anton Karas's zither a melancholy accompaniment. Welles's Harry Lime is a marvellously cynical flourish, presumed dead but found alive and thriving as a black marketeer by loyal old pal Joseph Cotten. The wonderful cast includes Trevor Howard, Bernard Lee and Wilfrid Hyde-White, all stamping redundant British values on central Europe. Lust For Life (Vincente Minnelli, 1956) 9pm, TCM An intense and dedicated performance from Kirk Douglas drives this unusually astute biopic about Vincent Van Gogh. Douglas learned to paint for the role, but the real energy is in his anguished depiction of the artist's tormented psyche, a man constantly on the edge of breakdown.

The side won the league and cup last year.</p> <p>However, Mr Folb admitted that the player had yet to come back with a response to the offer.

      "bodyText": "Brian Lara is more familiar with the hallowed grounds of Lord's and Edgbaston. But the highest scoring Test batsman might be persuaded to take the crease for a pub team in Kent. Simon Noble, 30, millionaire managing director of a Caribbean-based internet gambling empire, has approached Lara to persuade him to turn out for Lashings, a team he sponsors that began life in a Tex-Mex bar. The club already have the services of former West Indies Test players Richie Richardson, Stuart Williams and Junior Murray, and a peg in the dressing room at their ground at Sutton Valence school in Maidstone is reserved for BC Lara. The club has registered him as a player for the 2001 season with stunned East Kent League officials, and insist that the prospective signing is not a publicity stunt. In the past Muttiah Muralitharan (Sri Lanka) Gary Kirsten (South Africa) and Eldine Baptiste (West Indies and Kent) have played for Lashings. Lara, 31, the former West Indies captain, holds the record for the highest Test and first class scores, but recently has been experiencing problems with his form. A money-no-object offer from Mr Noble has been passed to the player and backed up with faxes to the West Indies tour hotels in Australia, where the side are coming to terms with a 5-0 Test series defeat. Lara is said to be considering the offer seriously. Mr Noble's previous generous sponsorship led to the signings last season of Stuart Williams and Junior Murray. Speaking from his headquarters in Antigua, Mr Noble said: \"I support Lashings because they have given several young West Indian players the chance to develop their game in England. \"For them to have a chance to play cricket with Brian Lara would be an unforgettable experience.\" David Folb, who founded Lashings, said last night: \"We're used to the big names. Richie came to us straight after the World Cup five years ago, and he was in pretty good form.\" Lara may find the promise of success at Lashings attractive. The side won the league and cup last year. However, Mr Folb admitted that the player had yet to come back with a response to the offer. But if Lara accepted he could be striding from the school pavilion by late June.",

      "bodyText": "The government was last night facing the embarrassing prospect of a \"treatment strike\" by growing numbers of haemophiliacs seeking to shame ministers into paying for safer blood clotting agents. As the government sought to calm protests over the way haemophiliacs, as late as 1997, had been exposed to potential infection from the human form of BSE, the Department of Health said patients should first consult their GPs. People with haemophilia are furious that for the third time in just over three years patients are being told that they have used products that have been found to include material from a variant CJD victim. The news, first reported in the Guardian this month, has forced ministers to consider whether to give adult haemophiliacs in England access to laboratory-made alternatives, as happened for children in Britain, and for adults in both Scotland and Wales. The Haemophilia Society said it had heard more patients were refusing treatment with clotting factor from human sources and joining networks that allow patients who do get the synthetic type, called recombinant, to send part of their dose to others without it. This is almost certainly illegal. But one patient who did this in the autumn forced his local health authority to pay for the more expensive recombinant factor. Karin Pappenheim, director of the Haemophilia Society, said it was not clear how many people might be affected by the postcode lottery over access to clotting treatment, but it could be as high as 2000. The government ordered the import of most blood plasma products two years ago because of the theoretical risk of infection by donors who had vCJD. Thirteen of the 88 known vCJD victims had been blood donors. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said that the risk of vCJD from existing clotting factors was \"unsubstantiated\".",

In an extraordinary twist of fate, the key DNA evidence that helped to convict David Frediani came from the very body of work on which the scientist had been engaged at the time of her death. A jury in Vista, California, decided that Frediani, 46, a financial analyst from San Francisco, murdered Helena Greenwood, who was 34, in the garden of her home in southern California in 1985. He will be sentenced on March 9 and will probably be jailed for life without parole. Ms Greenwood had moved to the United States in 1977 with her husband, Roger Franklin, having graduated from Sheffield University and completed her doctorate in biochemistry at the University of London.

In 1984, Frediani, then aged 30, broke into their home. Although Frediani, from nearby San Mateo, was an intelligent man who had held down a number of jobs in the financial sector, he also carried out burglaries in wealthy areas. He held Ms Greenwood, who was alone, at gunpoint for a number of hours and sexually assaulted her.

Frediani was not masked and Greenwood was able to provide police with enough information from what he had told her for them to find him and charge him with burglary and sexual assault.

In the meantime, Ms Greenwood was approached by the research company Gen-Probe of San Diego and offered a post of vice-president and a chance to continue her DNA research, working on the reading of gene sequences.

I will give them to you'.\" </p> <p>For four-and-a-half days the family sat in a subterranean tomb, imprisoned by slabs of masonry.

But last Friday the town's blocks of flats proved as perishable as those elsewhere in Gujarat. Some 51 buildings disintegrated.

At 3:30pm - after 103 hours - Mr Soni was carried out to wild applause. </p> <p>Recovering in the town's temporary hospital, Mr Soni described what happened. \"I was drinking tea in my house when the walls started breaking,\" he said. \"I stood with my feet to the wall.

I prayed to my God all that time and finally my shouts were heard.\" </p> <p>But Mr Soni's escape is far from typical, not just in Gandhidham but across Kutch, the barren desert district almost obliterated by the disaster.

      "body": "<p>I found it hard to believe Judge Juan Guzman in November 1998, when he told me he was going to put Augusto Pinochet on trial. Given how diligently he went on to pursue the case, I felt bad about my initial scepticism and confessed it to him a few weeks ago. In 1998, though, it had not seemed likely, with Pinochet under arrest in Britain, that Guzman's bluff would ever be called.</p> <p>At the time, Norman Lamont, the president of Chile and General Pinochet himself, were all arguing that he should be permitted to go home precisely because there was a fine judicial system in Chile, more than capable of doing any business that had to be done. But you didn't have to be terribly smart to know that Pinochet had his fingers crossed. After all, he has done more to damage the Chilean judicial system than most.</p> <p>Juan Guzman knew that too. He had been a judge throughout the dictatorship and knew perfectly well that Chile's judges had washed their hands of their responsibilities to the victims' families. With a few honourable exceptions, they had caved in to the fiction that every crime committed by a man in uniform is a military crime and should receive the sympathetic judgment of a military court. As Guzman now says, a military crime is when a soldier deserts, or falls asleep on duty. Torture, murder and aggravated kidnapping are criminal acts and it is the responsibility of the criminal courts to judge them.</p> <p>A few months ago, Guzman confessed that it hadn't seemed likely to him either, back in 1998, that he could or would get this far. He, too, had had his fingers crossed when he argued for Pinochet's return. All the more credit, then, to this modest and serious man for having risen to the occasion, despite the arguments of convenience, personal threats and social ostracism which have come with doing his judicial duty.</p> <p>The general, in these troubled days, has produced yet another version of history. Under the dictatorship, Pinochet's men used to say that tales of human rights abuse were mere communist propaganda and that the disappeared were all living it up in Sweden or Mexico. After the return to democracy the Rettig truth and reconciliation commission detailed a long list of torture cases, disappearance and death, and the general's men had to admit that there were a few such cases, but claimed that it was only to be expected in a \"war\" against subversion.</p> <p>General Guillermo Garin, Pinochet's right hand man, repeated this line to me recently. \"As you well know,\" he said, \"you have examples close to home.\" So for the record, there was no war in Chile. In the case of the \"Caravan of Death\", the 76 murders that took place mainly in the north of Chile in the space of a few days in October 1973, all the victims were already in the custody of the local military commanders. When Pinochet's \"special commission\", led by his friend General Arellano Starck arrived, the prisoners were taken out and murdered. Perhaps that happened, Pinochet has now admitted in his latest version, but if it did, it was the local military commanders who were to blame, not the innocent commander in chief.</p> <p>He really should not have ventured this final, cowardly lie. His remarks provoked a furious response from General Joaquin Lagos who was in command of Calama, a mining town in the Atacama desert, when Arellano Starck arrived in his helicopter on October 19 1973. General Lagos is in a good position to know what happened and has lived with a tortured conscience ever since because he could not prevent it.</p> <p>It was the duty, of course, of the local commanders to protect their prisoners. But when Arellano arrived with special orders from Pinochet, he outranked all of them and, under the military code, he assumed command for the duration of his visit. Had his orders not been obeyed, Arellano was entitled to have men like Lagos shot.</p> <p>When Arellano ordered the murder of 26 of his prisoners, Lagos protested. On whose authority, he demanded, was such a barbarous act to be committed? Arellano, in response, showed him the orders from Pinochet. Outraged, Lagos told Pinochet what had happened on October 20 1973, as Pinochet and his sinister wife, Dona Lucia were passing through Antofagasta airport. Pinochet asked for a written report, which Lagos duly sent to him. Pinochet ordered him to rewrite it to remove all mention of Arellano. Eight months later, Lagos left the army. Last week, he publicly produced both versions of the documents.</p> <p>The murders, of course, were crimes under the law. Had there been a war, the dead might have been passed off, if you did not look too closely, as casualties of conflict. But there was, I repeat, no war.</p> <p>Had Arellano acted without an order from Pinochet, it was Pinochet's clear duty under military law to court martial him. Instead, he promoted Arellano in December 1973, along with the officers who had accompanied him. Compare that with the fate of Major Fernando Reveco, also from Calama, who was tortured and imprisoned by the army that he loved, on charges of \"excessive leniency\" with the civilian population. Reveco confirms that the entire area was peaceful at the time.</p> <p>Why then, the caravan of death? Its purpose, Reveco says, was to instil terror not so much in the civilian population as in the army itself, to put on notice those officers who had a respect for the oath they had taken to defend both the constitution and the civilian population, that the time of constitutions, civil rights and the rule of law was over. As such, it was a key moment in the installation of the terrorist state that Pinochet set up after the 1973 coup.</p> <p>In order to restore the rule of law to Chile, that fine judicial system that he claims exists, Pinochet has to answer for those crimes. That is why Juan Guzman has again charged him with murder and aggravated kidnapping.</p> <p>There is a broad avenue in the centre of Santiago that begins at the back of the presidential palace. In it are several statues of heroic, patriotic figures and one empty space. It is that spot that Pinochet had picked out for a statue of himself - to commemorate the man who saved the nation from communism.

If cancelled, the government will have to pay almost \u00a32bn in compensation.</p> <p>Mr Chang gave the opposition-dominated legislature its political opening in October when he announced that work on the plant would halt immediately without reporting to them first.</p> <p>The KMT and two other main opposition parties hold 141 of the legislature's 221 seats: the DPP has 68 with the rest held by independents.</p> <p>China's highest legal body, the council of grand justices, has ruled that Mr Chang followed \"flawed procedures\" in halting work on the site, but it was unclear to whether he had violated the constitution.</p> <p>Observers say that Mr Chen has shown political inexperience in allowing what should have been a popular decision to be turned against him.</p> <p>Polls show that 30% to 40% of the public accept the anti-nuclear argument. But the opposition, backed by the markets, has convinced many others that an anti-nuclear decision will undermine financial confidence.</p> <p>KMT stalwarts, who ruled Taiwan dictatorially for more than 30 years, are now happily presenting themselves as champions of democracy against Mr Chen, whom they say has acted with wanton disregard for political process.</p> <p>Legislators yesterday accused him and the premier of lacking political wisdom and of risking his future in the same manner as the recently deposed president of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada.</p> <p>The independent Taipei Times yesterday urged both sides to seek a compromise.</p> <p>The DPP, it argued, should understand that \"a policy needs majority public support no matter what moral high-ground [it] may command\". It also urged the KMT to \"leave behind its ruling-party mentality\" and to stop opposing Mr Chen for the sake of opposition.</p> <p>The issue has definitely touch a raw nerve with the public; two Taiwanese men set themselves on fire in the run-up to the debate in the legislative council in protest against the project. Yesterday, however, some 50 protesters demonstrated peacefully outside the legislature holding pictures of the nuclear disasters at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl.</p>",

The opposition coalition, led by the KMT, is likely to call for Mr Chang's resignation and refuse to cooperate with the government. The row, which has been raging since autumn, also weakens Mr Chen's ability to work out a new relationship with Beijing, which is deeply suspicious of his nation-making intentions. The nuclear plant was originally pushed through by the previous KMT administration despite violent street protests, and is already one third complete. If cancelled, the government will have to pay almost \u00a32bn in compensation. Mr Chang gave the opposition-dominated legislature its political opening in October when he announced that work on the plant would halt immediately without reporting to them first. The KMT and two other main opposition parties hold 141 of the legislature's 221 seats: the DPP has 68 with the rest held by independents. China's highest legal body, the council of grand justices, has ruled that Mr Chang followed \"flawed procedures\" in halting work on the site, but it was unclear to whether he had violated the constitution. Observers say that Mr Chen has shown political inexperience in allowing what should have been a popular decision to be turned against him. Polls show that 30% to 40% of the public accept the anti-nuclear argument. But the opposition, backed by the markets, has convinced many others that an anti-nuclear decision will undermine financial confidence. KMT stalwarts, who ruled Taiwan dictatorially for more than 30 years, are now happily presenting themselves as champions of democracy against Mr Chen, whom they say has acted with wanton disregard for political process. Legislators yesterday accused him and the premier of lacking political wisdom and of risking his future in the same manner as the recently deposed president of the Philippines, Joseph Estrada. The independent Taipei Times yesterday urged both sides to seek a compromise. The DPP, it argued, should understand that \"a policy needs majority public support no matter what moral high-ground [it] may command\". It also urged the KMT to \"leave behind its ruling-party mentality\" and to stop opposing Mr Chen for the sake of opposition. The issue has definitely touch a raw nerve with the public; two Taiwanese men set themselves on fire in the run-up to the debate in the legislative council in protest against the project. Yesterday, however, some 50 protesters demonstrated peacefully outside the legislature holding pictures of the nuclear disasters at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl.",

Deterred by the cost of recruiting and paying bankers in the United States, ING also sold its US domestic operation to its Dutch rival ABN Amro yesterday. Over 1,300 staff will transfer to ABN Amro, which is preparing to pay lock-in bonuses of up to \u00a370m to retain top staff. The move is a reversal of the strategy previously adopted by ING, which only two years ago bought US broking firm Furman Selz as it embarked on a strategy to be become a leading investment bank. Yesterday, though, Michel Tilmant, vice chairman of ING's executive board, made it clear that ING no longer harboured ambitions to become a global investment bank. He said: \"In the US, the cost of doing business - hiring and paying - is very high.\" ING insisted, however, that it remained committed to investment banking in Europe, Asia and Latin America although will cut 1,000 staff as its restructures the operation along two main business lines - wholesale and financial markets - and shuts ING Barings' head office operations in the City. Control will move to Europe, where ING owns BBL and BHF. The 500 jobs being eliminated in London incorporates the 160 or so bankers who have already left, including the former chief executive David Robins. Another 160 will leave by the end of the week with the large majority of the remainder being agency staff. It will cost ING over \u00a3300m to pay for the restructuring but the company aims to reduce operating expenses as a result. ING will book a profit of around \u00a325m on the sale of the US domestic business to ABN Amro.",

      "body": "<p>Two thousand dirty and dust-covered containers in a laboratory in Liverpool contained the gruesome secrets of Professor Dick van Velzen's seven-year stockpile of body parts. Most of the containers, discovered in a basement, contained multiple organs and pieces of tissue collected from approximately 850 postmortem examinations. Some of the organs were poorly preserved as adequate levels of formalin had not been maintained.</p> <p>There was also a collection of 445 foetuses retained by Prof van Velzen between 1989-1991 and a total of 1,564 foetuses dating back to the 1950s. Nearly half of a stockpile of 188 eyes which had been kept from foetuses had not been used for research.</p> <p>\"There can be no doubt that Prof van Velzen failed parents and doctors at every level. Organs were retained so that parents unwittingly buried 'shells' of their children, causing immense distress when discovered,\" concluded the independent inquiry by Michael Redfern QC.</p> <p>\"The failure to perform histology [the study of organic tissue] means that the research undertaken by Prof van Velzen's unit is fundamentally flawed. His failure to report promptly, comprehensively and honestly means that parents were given inaccurate and incomplete information about the deaths of their loved ones.</p> <p>\"We have no hestitation whatsoever in recommending that Prof van Velzen's activities be investigated by the General Medical Council as a matter of urgency. In our opinion, he should not be allowed to practice again in the United Kingdom or anywhere else.\"</p> <p>The inquiry found that as well as thousands of organs, there were a number of children's heads and whole bodies stored at the hospital, dating back to the 1960s and early 1970s. There were 13 heads or parts of heads from children aged between a few days old and 11 years old, dating back to the 1960s, and 22 heads from premature or full-term foetuses.</p> <p>Two containers were found with the full body of a child in one and the head of an 11-year-old boy in another. The collection dates back to dental cleft palate research, before Prof van Velzen's time.</p> <p>The Redfern inquiry discovered that Professor van Velzen had lied to the interview committee and within a week of taking up his post in 1988 he ordered that there would be no more disposal of human material at Alder Hey.</p> <p>Hospital technical staff realised that his clinical practice in the removal and retention of organs was unlike anything they had seen before. Until then, pathologists had retained sections only of the relevant organs and returned everything to the body, except heart/lungs and possibly brain.</p> <p>In September 1988, the professor stopped histological analysis of organs as part of his routine clinical analysis. Instead, he prepared a lengthy and detailed report based upon the macroscopical (naked eye) findings.</p> <p>His appointment to the new Liverpool health authority chair of foetal and infant pathology, a joint position which involved working at Liverpool University, was against a background of near unanimous concern for the resources available. The premises and equipment were inadequate, the university authorities ignored convincing advice and informed warnings.</p> <p>Prof van Velzen was guilty of falsifying postmortem examinations and causing an unnecessary excessive, illegal and unethical build-up of organs following postmortem examination, ostensibly for research, but with no likelihood that the bulk of organs stored in containers would never be used for research.</p> <p>He delayed reporting on postmortem examination and histology to such an extent that in at least one case a second child was born to a family with the same genetic condition as an earlier child.</p> <p>In several cases, he ignored parents' wishes and did not carry out limited postmortem examinations as had been specified on consent forms. \"There can be no justification for Prof van Velzen's actions in these cases. His behaviour exemplified his lack of respect for the parents and their children.\"</p> <p>Research became the main activity of the professor, with his main work into the consequences of intra-uterine growth retardation. He used the research tool of stereology, which required whole organs.</p> <p>By spring 1991 at the latest, the executive board at Alder Hey knew that postmortem histology was not being carried out by Prof van Velzen. By autumn 1992 at the latest, the university knew that he was not fulfilling his contract for clinical sessions.</p> <p>The report found that Hilary Rowland, the former chief executive at Alder Hey, knew of his unreliable behaviour; his reputation as a maverick was well-established, according to the report.</p> <p>By 1994, Prof van Velzen was doing little or no clinical work. When he left Alder Hey the following year, there was a \u00a368,000 deficit.</p> <p>Alder Hey hospital was criticised for ignoring the warnings and failing to supervise him. Both the hospital and the university failed to properly resource the chair of foetal and infant pathology from the outset. They failed to monitor and follow up complaints about delays in providing postmortem and histology reports and they permitted Prof van Velzen to abdicate his clinical duties and responsibilities.</p> <p>\"Alder Hey and the university missed numerous opportunities to discipline Professor van Velzen for justifiable reasons from 1989 onwards,\" said the report.</p> <p>Liverpool University was singled out for criticism for never accepting its responsibility and leaving Alder Hey to make a series of mistakes.</p> <p>The university was aware of the existence of a collection of 146 cerebella in late 1999, gathered from brains retained by Prof van Velzen.</p> <p>But it was not until August 2000, that the hospital released the news of the cerebella collection. A group of 58 parents, who had already held second funerals, were told that there were cerebella yet to be buried. Yet again the parents were \"dismayed, disillusioned and distressed.\"</p> <p>\"The university has never accepted its responsibility in the matter and has left Alder Hey to make a sequence of mistakes,\" it said. \"Alder Hey have made four or five separate attempts to provide parents with accurate information relating to organ retention, not learning from and compounding mistakes made in each previous attempt.\"</p> <p>The inadequate handling strategy adopted by Alder Hey \"merely served to aggravate the situation to the extent that some families have faced numerous funerals as a result of organs being returned to them on a piecemeal basis. There are still organs awaiting repatriation.\"</p> <p><b>Wrongly delegated</b><br></p> <p>The former Liverpool coroner, Roy Barter, was criticised for wrongly considering that the decision to carry out a coroner's postmortem was a simple administrative decision, which he wrongly delegated to the coroner's officer. The inquiry found that the decision is one to be taken personally by the coroner.</p> <p>\"Mr Barter had no proper system for specifying the cases in which histology was required or identifying the organs or tissue to be preserved for histological examination by the pathologists.\"</p> <p>On several occasions, sudden infant death syndrome was accepted by him as the proper cause of death without histological examination being carried out, when he knew or should have known that the syndrome was a diagnosis of exclusion.</p> <p>\"He should have known that the reports he received from Prof van Velzen were preliminary reports without histology,\" the inquiry found.</p> <p>The inquiry discovered that the widespread practice of organ retention without consent arose from a sense of paternalism on the part of the medical profession which served to conceal retention in the supposed best interest of the parents.</p> <p>The report recommends that the Royal College of Pathologists instruct all practising histopathologists that they should not retain samples and organs beyond those needed to establish the cause of death, unless there is also written consent properly obtained under the Human Tissue Act 1961.</p> <p>The act should be amended to impose a criminal penalty for breach of its provisions.</p> <p>\"Fully informed consent means that a person must have all the information required to make a final decision. It is not enough for clinicians to tell the next of kin that they would like to examine the body after death and this might involve taking some tissue. The next of kin need to understand what is involved in a postmortem examination, including a description of whole body systems, removal of the brain and the steps necessary to remove various organs, no matter how distasteful the giving of this information might be to the clinician concerned.\"</p> <p>The new approach to consent should also involve a clinician, bereavement adviser and the next of kin.</p> <p>It concludes: \"The ultimate control should be a proper system of fully informed consent.

      "bodyText": "Two thousand dirty and dust-covered containers in a laboratory in Liverpool contained the gruesome secrets of Professor Dick van Velzen's seven-year stockpile of body parts. Most of the containers, discovered in a basement, contained multiple organs and pieces of tissue collected from approximately 850 postmortem examinations. Some of the organs were poorly preserved as adequate levels of formalin had not been maintained. There was also a collection of 445 foetuses retained by Prof van Velzen between 1989-1991 and a total of 1,564 foetuses dating back to the 1950s. Nearly half of a stockpile of 188 eyes which had been kept from foetuses had not been used for research. \"There can be no doubt that Prof van Velzen failed parents and doctors at every level. Organs were retained so that parents unwittingly buried 'shells' of their children, causing immense distress when discovered,\" concluded the independent inquiry by Michael Redfern QC. \"The failure to perform histology [the study of organic tissue] means that the research undertaken by Prof van Velzen's unit is fundamentally flawed. His failure to report promptly, comprehensively and honestly means that parents were given inaccurate and incomplete information about the deaths of their loved ones. \"We have no hestitation whatsoever in recommending that Prof van Velzen's activities be investigated by the General Medical Council as a matter of urgency. In our opinion, he should not be allowed to practice again in the United Kingdom or anywhere else.\" The inquiry found that as well as thousands of organs, there were a number of children's heads and whole bodies stored at the hospital, dating back to the 1960s and early 1970s. There were 13 heads or parts of heads from children aged between a few days old and 11 years old, dating back to the 1960s, and 22 heads from premature or full-term foetuses. Two containers were found with the full body of a child in one and the head of an 11-year-old boy in another. The collection dates back to dental cleft palate research, before Prof van Velzen's time. The Redfern inquiry discovered that Professor van Velzen had lied to the interview committee and within a week of taking up his post in 1988 he ordered that there would be no more disposal of human material at Alder Hey. Hospital technical staff realised that his clinical practice in the removal and retention of organs was unlike anything they had seen before. Until then, pathologists had retained sections only of the relevant organs and returned everything to the body, except heart/lungs and possibly brain. In September 1988, the professor stopped histological analysis of organs as part of his routine clinical analysis. Instead, he prepared a lengthy and detailed report based upon the macroscopical (naked eye) findings. His appointment to the new Liverpool health authority chair of foetal and infant pathology, a joint position which involved working at Liverpool University, was against a background of near unanimous concern for the resources available. The premises and equipment were inadequate, the university authorities ignored convincing advice and informed warnings. Prof van Velzen was guilty of falsifying postmortem examinations and causing an unnecessary excessive, illegal and unethical build-up of organs following postmortem examination, ostensibly for research, but with no likelihood that the bulk of organs stored in containers would never be used for research. He delayed reporting on postmortem examination and histology to such an extent that in at least one case a second child was born to a family with the same genetic condition as an earlier child. In several cases, he ignored parents' wishes and did not carry out limited postmortem examinations as had been specified on consent forms. \"There can be no justification for Prof van Velzen's actions in these cases. His behaviour exemplified his lack of respect for the parents and their children.\" Research became the main activity of the professor, with his main work into the consequences of intra-uterine growth retardation. He used the research tool of stereology, which required whole organs. By spring 1991 at the latest, the executive board at Alder Hey knew that postmortem histology was not being carried out by Prof van Velzen. By autumn 1992 at the latest, the university knew that he was not fulfilling his contract for clinical sessions. The report found that Hilary Rowland, the former chief executive at Alder Hey, knew of his unreliable behaviour; his reputation as a maverick was well-established, according to the report. By 1994, Prof van Velzen was doing little or no clinical work. When he left Alder Hey the following year, there was a \u00a368,000 deficit. Alder Hey hospital was criticised for ignoring the warnings and failing to supervise him. Both the hospital and the university failed to properly resource the chair of foetal and infant pathology from the outset. They failed to monitor and follow up complaints about delays in providing postmortem and histology reports and they permitted Prof van Velzen to abdicate his clinical duties and responsibilities. \"Alder Hey and the university missed numerous opportunities to discipline Professor van Velzen for justifiable reasons from 1989 onwards,\" said the report. Liverpool University was singled out for criticism for never accepting its responsibility and leaving Alder Hey to make a series of mistakes. The university was aware of the existence of a collection of 146 cerebella in late 1999, gathered from brains retained by Prof van Velzen. But it was not until August 2000, that the hospital released the news of the cerebella collection. A group of 58 parents, who had already held second funerals, were told that there were cerebella yet to be buried. Yet again the parents were \"dismayed, disillusioned and distressed.\" \"The university has never accepted its responsibility in the matter and has left Alder Hey to make a sequence of mistakes,\" it said. \"Alder Hey have made four or five separate attempts to provide parents with accurate information relating to organ retention, not learning from and compounding mistakes made in each previous attempt.\" The inadequate handling strategy adopted by Alder Hey \"merely served to aggravate the situation to the extent that some families have faced numerous funerals as a result of organs being returned to them on a piecemeal basis. There are still organs awaiting repatriation.\" Wrongly delegated The former Liverpool coroner, Roy Barter, was criticised for wrongly considering that the decision to carry out a coroner's postmortem was a simple administrative decision, which he wrongly delegated to the coroner's officer. The inquiry found that the decision is one to be taken personally by the coroner. \"Mr Barter had no proper system for specifying the cases in which histology was required or identifying the organs or tissue to be preserved for histological examination by the pathologists.\" On several occasions, sudden infant death syndrome was accepted by him as the proper cause of death without histological examination being carried out, when he knew or should have known that the syndrome was a diagnosis of exclusion. \"He should have known that the reports he received from Prof van Velzen were preliminary reports without histology,\" the inquiry found. The inquiry discovered that the widespread practice of organ retention without consent arose from a sense of paternalism on the part of the medical profession which served to conceal retention in the supposed best interest of the parents. The report recommends that the Royal College of Pathologists instruct all practising histopathologists that they should not retain samples and organs beyond those needed to establish the cause of death, unless there is also written consent properly obtained under the Human Tissue Act 1961. The act should be amended to impose a criminal penalty for breach of its provisions. \"Fully informed consent means that a person must have all the information required to make a final decision. It is not enough for clinicians to tell the next of kin that they would like to examine the body after death and this might involve taking some tissue. The next of kin need to understand what is involved in a postmortem examination, including a description of whole body systems, removal of the brain and the steps necessary to remove various organs, no matter how distasteful the giving of this information might be to the clinician concerned.\" The new approach to consent should also involve a clinician, bereavement adviser and the next of kin. It concludes: \"The ultimate control should be a proper system of fully informed consent. The evidence indicates that many parents will readily consent to retention for these purposes, if sensitively approached with openness, honesty and transparency.\" Talk about it Health minister live online John Hutton was live online today.

In the US, a lively market has grown up for human skin for use in plastic surgery and for a wide range of products such as screws, dowels and spacers carved out of human bone and used in spinal surgery. Brain Much of our knowledge of the brain comes from studies of brains removed from the dead, since it is such an inaccessible organ in life. The existence of new variant CJD could not have been established without studying post mortem brain tissue. Eye Very rarely removed in postmortem examinations unless foul play suspected. Not generally used for research. Tonsils Source of anti-bodies used to test patients' immune system. Bonemarrow Used in study of immune system and leukaemia. Lungs Lungs removed from living patients prior to heart-lung transplants can be helpful in understanding of lung disease. Thymus gland Used to save transplant patients. Heart Used in research to minimise death rate in heart surgery, learn more about heart abnormalities, develop new surgical techniques, and in training. Study of heart collection at Alder Hey thought to have saved lives of 1,600 children by drastically cutting risk of surgery early in life. Liver Research into complex blood supply to liver has sharply lowered risk of liver damage in surgery against cancer. Liver cells removed from living patients now being used as potential alternative to animal testing of new drugs. Kidney Tissue being used to test new kidney cancer diagnosis technique. Colon Used in research into inflammatory bowel disease. Pancreas Cells removed from living patients being used in promising new anti-diabetes treatment. Ovary Used to study hormone production. Foetus Research into diseases of gut, treatment of neuroblastoma and general foetal development. Foetal tissue being used as treatment for Parkinson's disease. Thigh muscle Tissues from quadriceps used for research into reprogramming muscles.",

      "bodyText": "South Wales is bracing itself for a wave of steel plant closures within the next 48 hours which will rip the heart out of the country's manufacturing base and may lead to up to 5,000 job losses. A last desperate round of meetings in Brussels and London yesterday failed to move Corus, the privatised steelmakers who claim that restructuring is necessary due to the pound's strength against the Euro and the loss of traditional British manufacturing markets. The company employs 3,500 workers at Port Talbot, 3,000 at Llanwern in Newport and 3,500 elsewhere in Britain. The Newport steel rolling plant has been threatened with closure and there are likely to be job losses across the rest of the company. Any closure would have a vast political and economic impact. Labour fears it could lead to a surge in support for Plaid Cymru which is making inroads in south Wales. Labour MPs and ministers are furious at the company's attitude - and the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, has already given notice that Corus will be accused of short-termism if it cuts production in Britain just as the crippling gap between the euro and sterling is lessening. Mr Byers' avenues of action are limited as strict European Union rules ban direct state aid to steelmaking firms. Last night there were calls for the resignation of the Corus chairman, Sir Brian Moffat, who has met Labour MPs and the prime minister this week. After the stormy meeting, the MP for Rotherham, Denis MacShane, who is chairman of the 70-strong group of steel MPs, said: \"I think the scales may have dropped from the eyes of some of our political leaders as they see the extent to which Corus and Sir Brian Moffat have arrogantly refused to share information or consult with the nation's elected leaders and representatives on the fate of UK steel communities\". In Brussels, the European commission promised to fast track the provision of aid to south Wales as a delegation of Labour MEPs led by Eluned Morgan failed to persuade the Corus European management to reconsider their plans. She claimed the Corus workforce in Holland had more information on the plight of UK steel plants than British workforce and said that the lack of consultation should force the government to rethink its refusal to back the EU directive on worker consultation. Even the Department for Education and Employment, which wants to prepare retraining packages, has been frustrated by the company's refusal to give an age profile of the workforce. In a last-ditch effort to persuade the company to reprieve the Llanwern plant, the Welsh first minister, Rhodri Morgan, had warned Corus that it would be made to pay for clearing up the site after closure, even though the act of parliament which gives this right is not yet in force in Wales. Lord Sainsbury confirmed to peers yesterday that the company told the Welsh assembly that it was not interested in its rescue package. Downing Street yesterday hinted that Brussels would allow state aid to the steel firm, in the form of research and development grants, which Labour is willing to provide. \"We believe there is a future for a viable steel industry in this country,\" a spokesman said. \"The government's job is to talk to industry. We have made it clear that we stand ready to do whatever we can. But no one underestimates the difficulties.\"",

But the initial focus will be on the return of organs, body parts and foetuses that were taken by pathologists and stored after 1970.</p> <p>Scientists have argued that the material stored in museums and archives before that date is of great national and international medical value. The retained organs commission will advise the government on how to deal with these collections.</p> <p>The CMO, Professor Donaldson says the census total is not an exact figure. It is probably higher. Hospitals have not kept accurate records of the material they hold - a practice that his report says must change. Some hospitals at first told him it was impossible to calculate what they had, but eventually provided an estimate.</p> <p>As well as the organs, body parts and foetuses, there is a vast amount of human tissue; 480,600 samples which are held in museums and archives. At the moment, there are no plans for their return.</p> <p>From the post-1970 period, there are about 54,300 organs, body parts, stillbirths and foetuses held by pathology services, but the biggest concentrations are in a relatively few places. Twenty-five institutions hold more than 500 organs each, which amount to 88% of the total.</p> <p>Although the original outcry resulted from the retention of hearts, they made up only a sixth of the organs taken, while brains accounted for half. One reason for the widespread retention of brains may be that for a brain to be examined it has to be \"fixed\" with chemicals, which takes four to six weeks, by which time the funeral has taken place.</p> <p>More organs were retained from postmortem examinations of adults (17,800) than of children or babies (9,800). There were 2,900 stillbirths or pre-viable foetuses.</p> <p>The report reveals that the terms of the law were regularly breached. Organs were removed and kept for research during coroner's autopsies, even though the law says they may be removed only to estab lish the cause of death, and should then be returned to relatives.</p> <p>The CMO says the coroner's rules will be overhauled. Mr Milburn announced in the Commons that the home secretary had set in train a review of the coroner's system, to see what lessons could be learned.</p> <p>But even where consent forms were signed by parents or relatives for hospital autopsies - examinations requested by doctors so they can find out more about why patients died - the CMO's report makes it clear they had no idea what they were agreeing to.</p> <p>While he says there are important gains to be made in medical science from autopsies and the study of organs and tissues removed, Prof Donaldson highlights a gulf between the pathologist and the bereaved relative. \"There has been no adequate recognition or acknowledgement on the part of the majority of NHS staff or many doctors, of the feelings people have on the recent loss of a family member, particularly a child, and the extent to which they feel the need to protect a child even after that child's death,\" he writes.</p> <p>There were fundamental problems with the consent forms, which followed a similar pattern in most hospitals, suggesting that they were once standardised within the NHS although nobody can remember when or how. The forms do not ask for permission, but ask relatives to sign to say they \"do not object\" to autopsies.</p> <p>If they sign, they say they understand examination \"may involve retention of tissue for laboratory study\" and that tissue may also be removed \"for the treatment of other patients and for medical education and research\". None of this led parents to suspect that their children's hearts, brains or other organs might be removed and stored in jars.</p> <p>The CMO recommends a standardised consent form to be used throughout the NHS, which will lay out clearly the different organs and tissues that might be wanted for research purposes and give relatives the option to agree to the removal of some, but not others. Many people, for instance, do not mind the use of internal organs but cannot countenance the removal of eyes.</p> <p>Relatives will be able to limit the use to which the organs can be put and will be able to specify what they want to happen to organs or tissue that are no longer needed by doctors. Prof Donaldson says the public might find it particularly shocking that the majority of organs which are no longer needed are incinerated as clinical waste. He adds that cultural beliefs and religious practices also need to be respected.</p> <p>The law will be changed to require doctors to obtain this full consent and to make it an offence to proceed with an autopsy without it, but the measures will be brought in first for consent involving children. Prof Donaldson says it is simple to work out who has the right to give consent for a child, but it is more complicated in the case of an adult.</p> <p>In the interests of the feelings of relatives and the needs of medical science, he wants a fundamental change in the treatment of relatives who have just seen loved ones die. \"People were descended on within minutes of the death. That is insensitive and it has to stop,\" he says.</p> <p>All hospitals will have to employ bereavement counsellors who can help relatives through each stage, from being told of a death, to a full understanding of the consent form for an autopsy. The counsellor would also ensure they had time to think it over.</p> <p>But the whole thinking about autopsies had to change, too. \"At the moment the language in the law is all about taking, retention and making sure people don't object,\" Prof Donaldson says. \"It isn't about asking people. It isn't about seeking permission. It isn't about donation.</p> <p>\"It should be more in the territory of a relationship based on a gift for which we feel and express gratitude.\"</p> <p>The CMO also proposes that the parents of a child whose heart is taken for research should put together \"a scrapbook or life book\", which would be stored with the organ. It would be shown to medical students so that they \"realise that this was a real person\".</p> <p><br><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.societytheguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7e516\">Health minister live online</a><br>John Hutton was live online today.

      "bodyText": "Education secretary David Blunkett acknowledged yesterday that Peter Mandelson's resignation had damaged Labour, by increasing cynicism and by potentially lowering voter turn-out, one of the biggest threats to a second Labour term. Mr Blunkett was speaking after a special two hour cabinet meeting at which Tony Blair urged his colleagues to harden the policy differences between Labour and the Conservatives. The government is expected to announce initiatives on persistent criminals and secondary schools in the next few weeks. The warning about voter cynicism was made on the PM programme after a poll emerged suggesting that voters regarded Labour as more sleazy than the Conservatives. The NOP poll, commissioned by the Powerhouse programme, found that 49% of respondents thought Labour \"give the impression of being very sleazy and disreputable\", compared with only 19% responding to the same question before the last election. The Tories had improved their image. In 1997 63% of the public had thought they appeared sleazy, compared to 47% now. Mr Blunkett said the poll was very worrying. \"I think that 'a plague on all your houses', or \"all politicians are in it for themselves', is very dangerous for our democracy, and it plays into the hands of our opponents who would like to see a very low turn-out,\" said Mr Blunkett. \"If you take any opinion poll, few people believe politicians, and the more that corrosive feeling gets across, the less people switch into and take notice of the major events around them.\" Mr Blunkett said he hoped voters would realise in time that the Mandelson controversy was not about a politi cian pocketing cash for himself. He admitted: \"We have had almost almost a week of massive publicity, headlines, speculation oozing out of every media outlet about whether a conversation took place about someone's nationality application.\" Labour strategists recognise that William Hague is trying to move closer to Labour in the areas where Labour is most popular, including public spending and a rejection of basic income tax cuts. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, drawing in part on lessons from the US, told yesterday's meeting that Labour had to make sure that voters understood that the successful economy and falling mortages resulted directly from decisions taken by the government. Labour has tried to encapture the argument in the slogan: Choice, not chance. Yesterday's cabinet heard that Labour was still ahead on every big issue, even Europe. It had also managed to recover ground lost with older voters, largely due to the pre-budget report promising big rises in the basic pension. However, Lady Jay, the women's minister, told the meeting that younger women voters had deserted Labour more than any other single group since the election.

Ministers briefly discussed extra help for child care and a package of family friendly policies. Mr Blair told ministers during a lengthy speech that \"the Tories will try to close down policy debate as much as possible, and hide behind a strategy of cynicism\". Cabinet members do not believe the Mandelson affair in itself will lose Labour votes in the long term, but they believe it may add to the impression of an arrogant government that is fundamentally little different from the Conservatives. Labour officials hope to dispel the image of arrogance though a \"thank you\" poster campaign. In an effort to galvanise a largely apathetic party, John Prescott will start a one month \"get ready\" tour of party workers, starting in Huddersfield on Wednesday. The deputy prime minister will be accompanied by a jazz band, comedians and soap celebrities. He said yesterday: \"There is no room for complacency.

However, his cold, confident manner, coupled with a piercing glare typically delivered over his spectacles, did not encourage them to question him.</p> <p>What the report rather chillingly dubs \"the Van Velzen years\" ended in 1995 when he left Alder Hey for the IWK Grace hospital in Nova Scotia. He was dismissed after six months amid allegations of incompetence. Last year it emerged that Canadian police wanted to question him about the storage of children's body parts in a warehouse.</p> <p>He moved to Port of Spain hospital in Trinidad but by December 1999, when the organs retention scandal broke, was back in his homeland, working at the Westeinde hospital in the Hague. He took an indefinite leave of absence in October and set about defending himself.</p> <p>He claimed that Alder Hey was aware of the stored organs because he had sent a detailed report to the hospital's management as far back as 1993.</p> <p>Prof Van Velzen told the NOS television channel in the Netherlands: \"I warned [Alder Hey] management from 1993 that from the ethical point of view it was a time-bomb. Now they are trying to describe me as a kind of Dr Frankenstein, just to get themselves off the hook.\"</p> <p>For now, he is in hiding.</p> <p>His family home, a modest semi in the village of Oegstgeest 10 miles from the Hague which he shares with his English wife, Lynn, who also used to work at Alder Hey, and nine-year-old daughter, Sarah, appeared deserted yesterday. A withered Christmas wreath hung from the front door and pumpkins lay decomposing on the doorstep.</p> <p>He left home under police escort on Monday night, but not before an ugly altercation with a photographer from the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>Hans Reesink, 41, a neighbour and friend, said Prof Van Velzen was convinced he had done nothing wrong. \"He is a nice guy and an honourable man. He was completely confident that it would all turn out well when I spoke to him. Because of different laws there have been a lot of misunderstandings.\"</p> <p>But another neighbour, Betsy Blanken, said her three children had been asking her unsettling questions about Prof Van Velzen. \"They were afraid.

What the report rather chillingly dubs \"the Van Velzen years\" ended in 1995 when he left Alder Hey for the IWK Grace hospital in Nova Scotia. He was dismissed after six months amid allegations of incompetence. Last year it emerged that Canadian police wanted to question him about the storage of children's body parts in a warehouse. He moved to Port of Spain hospital in Trinidad but by December 1999, when the organs retention scandal broke, was back in his homeland, working at the Westeinde hospital in the Hague. He took an indefinite leave of absence in October and set about defending himself. He claimed that Alder Hey was aware of the stored organs because he had sent a detailed report to the hospital's management as far back as 1993. Prof Van Velzen told the NOS television channel in the Netherlands: \"I warned [Alder Hey] management from 1993 that from the ethical point of view it was a time-bomb. Now they are trying to describe me as a kind of Dr Frankenstein, just to get themselves off the hook.\" For now, he is in hiding. His family home, a modest semi in the village of Oegstgeest 10 miles from the Hague which he shares with his English wife, Lynn, who also used to work at Alder Hey, and nine-year-old daughter, Sarah, appeared deserted yesterday. A withered Christmas wreath hung from the front door and pumpkins lay decomposing on the doorstep. He left home under police escort on Monday night, but not before an ugly altercation with a photographer from the Daily Telegraph. Hans Reesink, 41, a neighbour and friend, said Prof Van Velzen was convinced he had done nothing wrong. \"He is a nice guy and an honourable man. He was completely confident that it would all turn out well when I spoke to him. Because of different laws there have been a lot of misunderstandings.\" But another neighbour, Betsy Blanken, said her three children had been asking her unsettling questions about Prof Van Velzen. \"They were afraid. I told them not to worry.\" Talk about it Health minister live online John Hutton was live online today. Read what he said and have your say.

      "bodyText": "The Indian police yesterday tried to prevent the Hindujas from returning to Britain after claiming that they acquired UK passports to help them to fight possible charges in the Bofors arms corruption case. Lawyers for India's central bureau of investigation asked a New Delhi court not to allow the billionaire brothers to go abroad after saying they had been evasive during interrogation. If they were allowed to leave India, conditions should be attached to ensure they returned for any trial resulting from allegations that they banked illegal \"commissions\" when Bofors in Sweden sold howitzers to India in the 1980s, police said. Judge Ajit Bharihoke will give his ruling tomorrow. The Hindujas' legal team requested bail and offered to accept any conditions imposed by the judge, promising the family's full cooperation. If allowed to return, the two British based brothers at the centre of the passport row, Srichand (SP) and Gopichand (GP), face questioning by Sir Anthony Hammond QC over how they got their British nationality. The controversy has already cost Peter Mandelson his political career after he was accused of lying about his role, and has threatened the future of the minister for Europe, Keith Vaz. The charge sheet filed in India against SP, GP and Swiss-based Prakash, who also asked for Mr Mandelson's help to get a passport, ties the Bofors investigation to the passport applications of SP and GP. According to the police, who have investigated the Bofors deal for 10 years, \"the change of nationality of both these Hindujas brothers is directly linked\" to legal action brought by police, and unsuccessfully opposed by the Hindujas, to gain access to Swiss bank accounts through which the kickbacks were allegedly channelled. SP and GP, then Indian nationals, are alleged to have opened accounts called Tulip and Lotus with the Geneva branch of the Hanover Trust Company of New York in May 1986 to receive the illegal payments. The investigation started in 1990, though police had to wait until 1998 before they could examine the Swiss accounts. The Swiss cantonal court dismissed an appeal by the brothers in 1999. GP was granted British nationality in 1997 and SP in 1999 after earlier applications had been rejected. Criminal charges in India alleging corruption would embarrass a series of ministers from Tony Blair down who have met SP and GP. SP disclosed at the weekend that Mr Vaz was asked to advise the brothers on what protection British passports would provide if they were formally charged in India. The Hindujas have admitted receiving money from Bofors but maintain it had nothing to do with the gun deal. They told the court they had gone to India voluntarily to be questioned, and their business was suffering while they were out of London. Criticising the police, SP said: \"They have not given a correct picture to the judge. We have answered all kinds of questions put to us by the CBI, and there is nothing more they have to know from us, yet they say we were being evasive. Nothing can be farther from the truth.\" Related articles 29.01.2001, analysis: The Mandelson row - inside New Labour 29.01.2001: Cabinet cuts off Mandelson 29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows 29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached' 29.01.2001: Brother deals new blow to Vaz 29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control 29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important 28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go 25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins 25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me Audio 24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement Useful links 26.1.2001: Lobby press briefing on Vaz/Mandelson - 10 Downing Street Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001 24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement Hinduja group history Downing Street press briefing Hartlepool Mail",

      "body": "<p>Lunch with Lindsay Duncan is a daunting prospect. She's best known for cool, commanding, often predatory roles: the Marquise de Merteuil in the Royal Shakespeare Company's Les Liaisons Dangereuses, say, or basque-wearing Barbara in Alan Bleasdale's TV drama GBH. You half expect her to snap at the waitress, then send back her smoked haddock soup because it's too fishy or too wet. But she's nice as pie, all please and thank you and, \"Are you sure you've got enough to eat?\" When director Peter Brook drifts into the restaurant, she gasps with excitement. </p> <p>Duncan is taking a brief break from rehearsing a new play for the Royal Court. When she goes back, she says, someone is sure to ask her: \"So, did you talk a load of old bollocks?\" And she'll reply: \"Yes.\" </p> <p>Perhaps it's work that keeps her mellow. For the past few weeks Duncan has been preparing Mouth to Mouth, by her old friend Kevin Elyot, creator of the hit play My Night With Reg. She plays Laura, a married woman whose nearest and dearest would drive anyone round the bend. The play has Aids, death, infidelity, the supernatural, humour and tragedy - yet done with a lightness of touch that might easily come across as flippancy. </p> <p>But Duncan is sure it will be a success. \"I was quite shaken when I read it for the first time,\" she says in her perfectly articulated Home Counties tones. \"It's a devastating play, a passionate play. Kevin has a serious comic gift but he also has a depth of feeling. With every fibre of my being I consider this to be a remarkable play. But no matter how you try to say that, it sounds forced, false, because what else am I going to say? It's very hard to talk about a piece of writing that moves you.\" </p> <p>And, God knows, there is some rubbish out there. She won't name names, but it sounds as if she means The Graduate. \"There's a famous screenplay, from one of the most brilliant films ever made, that has just been stuck on the stage. I haven't seen it; why would I? It seems to be an entirely cynical exercise. What's the real motivation for doing that kind of theatre? The producer isn't going, 'My God, I really believe in this piece of writing.' </p> <p>\"I do feel almost violent when I'm watching things that I don't think are good enough. I get furious for the audience. I want to say them, 'This play is not supposed to be like this. They've got it completely wrong. You should be electrified by this.' \" </p> <p>Duncan, 50, was born in Scotland and spent the first six years of her life there. She can't remember precisely when or why she decided to be an actor, but there was a family tradition of performance. \"My parents' generation was definitely pre-telly, and they knew how to entertain each other. Everybody knew something that they could do - a song or a poem, or a piece of music. At school I remember being a cat and then a budgie and then a bumble bee. I obviously thought all that was marvellous.\" </p> <p>Was she - is she - one of those revolting people who are always performing to friends and family? \"I'm not remotely like that. I don't perform well in private.\" She giggles. \"Socially, I mean. And I didn't as a child. Actors aren't necessarily outgoing, are they?\" Even now, the thought of parlour games sends a chill down her spine. \"That awful thing of playing charades! People expect you to do something magnificently well-honed - act out the whole of Ben Hur - and then they're terribly disappointed when you're humming and hawing.\" </p> <p>After three years at the Central School of Drama, Duncan got her first acting job in weekly rep in East Anglia. \"It was terribly weird and old-fashioned and a bit mad,\" she recalls. \"You go from being this London drama student to doing Agatha Christies and performing at the end of a pier. Swapping clothes, because you had to provide your own costumes. It was all rather camp, really - like being in a time warp. But I just loved it. It was so bonkers.\" </p> <p>Rep was followed by more challenging work - the opening season at the Royal Exchange, Top Girls at the Royal Court - and finally, in the 1980s, the RSC, alongside Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw and Juliet Stevenson. </p> <p>What made Duncan's name was the RSC's production of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, which won her an Olivier in Britain, and took her to the States, where she was nominated for a Tony. \"A lot of people left the theatre wanting to have sex, and most of them wanted to have it with Alan Rickman,\" she famously remarked. Duncan is now part of Harold Pinter's informal repertory company and an obvious choice whenever a TV drama needs a sexy, classy older woman, like The Rector's Wife or Shooting the Past. </p> <p>But if Les Liaisons was her big break, it was also a missed opportunity. For Stephen Frears's film of the play, Duncan and Rickman were replaced by Glenn Close and John Malkovich. \"I'm probably more annoyed about that now than I was at the time. We'd done it and done it and done it on stage over a period of two years. Alan and I particularly just looked like a couple of ghouls at the end of it - completely wasted. The thing is, we knew there had to be American actors. We even went out with dinner with the people who'd bought the film rights to talk about casting. And, you know, they didn't make a completely ridiculous film. </p> <p>\"But really,\" she continues, \"the only time I think about it is when it comes up in interviews.\" It's all part of \"the most familiar, boring, boring theme: why haven't I got a film career? Why didn't I go to Hollywood? Did I go to Hollywood and did I fail? People seem to think I'm feeling happy, fulfilled, challenged, so they'll just just chip away: 'You could have done more!' </p> <p>\"Of course, movies are the universal art form. They communicate to a vast amount of people. You earn a hell of a lot of money and have a fantastic lifestyle. But I don't see that it all happens there and that I'm at the wrong end of the spectrum. I reckon where I am is the sharp end.\" </p> <p>Duncan is married to another actor, Hilton McRae. Would she be happy for their nine-year-old son, Cal, to go into the business? \"Neither Hilton nor I came from acting families. But I do want him to do something creative that he enjoys. I want him to feel about work the way we feel about work. I want him to get really excited when he's more than halfway through his life about a job. That's got to be the best thing.\" </p> <p>Is she one of those actors who have to ground every part in their own experience? In Mouth to Mouth, where she plays a mother of a teenage son, is she thinking of her own boy? \"Ugh, no,\" she shudders. \"There would be something faintly disgusting about using that relationship. I'd find it quite spooky.\" </p> <p>Yet many actors do insist everything comes down to personal experience. \"That's bollocks, isn't it? I've played so many parts where I simply haven't had that life experience. And what would be the point of being an actor? If it was all down to experience, you could get up there and do it. Obviously, every actor is the better for being engaged in the world, but beyond that ... You just get practised at exercising your imagination, and hopefully reading a play more accurately - literally and intellectually and emotionally. I've always been a material-based actor. That's what I've done, the choices I've made - like a heat-seeking missile.\" And off she goes, back to her script. </p> <p>\u0095 Mouth to Mouth is in previews at the Royal Court, London SW1 (020-7565 5000), from tomorrow and runs until March 10.</p>",

Companies with clout can negotiate small revenue sharing deals - but most of these budding entrepreneurs cannot make money, since the telcos vacuum up all the revenues - even though neither the calls nor the text messages would have happened at all without the innovative business ideas. The BTs and Vodafones of this world must offer revenue sharing deals. It would create more cash in the long term than they would lose. And it would encourage a nascent industry instead of smothering it at birth.",

Ditto the Mirror; and ditto ditto our old friend Paul Johnson of the Daily Mail. Johnson now denounces the \"corrupt\" and \"wretched\" Mandelson as \"the fastest and most determined social climber I have ever come across\" (a title which many of us thought Johnson himself had won outright), and chides the PM for making \"the crass mistake of restoring Mandelson to office after the most perfunctory interval - an act of folly strongly criticised at the time by his own colleagues and backbenchers\".</p> <p>Is this the same Paul Johnson who in November 1997 wrote that \"Mandelson is tall, dark, handsome and ... probably the most hard-working man in British politics today\"? And who in April 1998 advised Blair to make Mandelson foreign secretary, \"a job for which his discretion and astonishing industry make him well suited\"? And who, a few months later, deplored \"the recent vicious campaign against Peter Mandelson\", advising Blair to show his confidence in this \"faithful lieutenant\" by \"giving him a prominent place in the cabinet\"?</p> <p>Even at the time of Mandelson's first resignation, two years ago, Johnson's enthusiasm was undimmed: \"I know Mandelson well and like him. I also admire his skill and dedication in the public service, his devotion to the prime minister and his aims, and the guts with which he has faced more than his fair share of often grotesquely ill-informed criticism ... My own view, as one who wishes to remain his friend, is clear. His political career can still be salvaged.\"</p> <p>They flee from Peter that sometime did him seek, and all is turned into \"a strange fashion of forsaking\". Yet he emerges from this with rather more credit and integrity than those who feel emboldened to kick him only now that he's down. Whatever one's opinions of New Labour (and this column's attitude is, I think, pretty well known), he was at least a true believer - with the emphasis on the word true.</p> <p>This made the supposedly devious Mandelson a more honest character than his colleagues who privately wince and snigger at the Third Way but nevertheless spout unadulterated Blairite jargon in public and in cabinet: people such as the senior minister who, after reading a Blairosceptic article on this page, gave me a conspiratorial wink and murmured \"Keep up the good work\" before heading off to a TV studio to denounce fainthearts and malcontents who doubt the New Labour gospel.</p> <p>A week after his downfall, it is still difficult to see what uniquely vile offence Mandelson committed. If being chummy with the Hindujas is grounds for resignation, the front benches of both major parties would be almost empty. Ah yes, say the tinpot Torquemadas of Westminster, but he told a lie to the Observer - or, at the very least, gave a misleading answer. As Clare Short put it: \"He went because he has got problems telling the truth.\"</p> <p>If that were the real reason, many other ministers would have preceded him to the gallows. When Gordon Brown appeared on the Today programme just as the Bernie Ecclestone scandal broke, he was asked point-blank if Ecclestone had given money to Labour. \"You'll have to wait and see, like I'll have to wait and see when the list is published,\" he replied. \"I've not been told.\" This was a lie: Blair had told Brown about the donation the previous week.</p> <p>Blair himself then submitted to a TV interrogation by John Humphrys. He claimed that Ecclestone's second donation was refused \"before any journalist had been in touch,\" and that \"the question then arose which was uppermost in my mind, what about the original donation? We decided to seek the advice of Sir Patrick Neill.\" Both these statements were lies: the letter to Neill was written only after journalists began sniffing around; and it asked for advice only about the second donation, not the first. (Lest we forget, this was the same interview in which the PM boasted of being a pretty straight kinda guy.)</p> <p>What of Jack Straw, the sea-green incorruptible who shopped Mandelson to Downing Street because ministers have a sacred duty \"to give the whole truth\"? At the Labour conference in 1999 the home secretary declared that \"we will be giving the police the money they need to recruit 5,000 more officers. That's 5,000 more officers over and above the police service's recruiting plans. That's not the sort of hollow promise the Conservatives used to make.\"</p> <p>But it was. Alan Milburn, then chief secretary to the Treasury, had sent Straw a warning letter three days before the speech. \"I must stress that, as has been discussed at length and agreed with your officials and contrary to your letter of September 23 to Derry Irvine, the package does not provide for 5,000 'additional' officers,\" he wrote. \"There should therefore be no references to this package being one for 5,000 additional officers.\"</p> <p>Milburn became health secretary soon after the party conference - and promptly revealed his own talent for creative accountancy by announcing that he intended to recruit an \"extra\" 410 consultants in heart disease by the year 2005. All these new doctors turned out to be people who were already working as senior heart specialists in the NHS: all he meant was that they would have qualified as consultants by 2005.</p> <p>There have been dozens of these multiple announcements - and straightforwardly bogus announcements - since May 1997. Many ministers, it seems, have \"a problem with telling the truth\". Messrs Blair, Brown, Straw, Byers and Milburn have not resigned yet; nor has anyone seriously suggested that they should. Why, then, is Mandelson cast into the outer darkness with many a shout of \"good riddance\"?</p> <p>The answer can be found in The World of the Favourite, a recent book of scholarly essays edited by the historians Sir John Elliott and Laurence Brockliss. Although commentators have often described Mandelson's position at the Court of Tony as \"unprecedented\" and \"extraordinary\", the minister-favourite is in fact a familiar historical type.</p> <p>Edward II had Piers Gaveston, Catherine the Great had Potemkin, Louis XIV had Fouquet, Henry VIII had Wolsey, James I had Somerset and then Buckingham. Strong rulers as well as weak ones have found it useful to share their burdens with a single trusted and efficient minister. But the favourite's power and influence provoke intense ill-feeling among other courtiers, who regard him as a sinister usurping parvenu with ideas above his station, or perhaps even a sorcerer. (When the Earl of Somerset fell from favour in 1616, he was charged with witchcraft.)</p> <p>As Brockliss points out, it was the favourites who \"took the flak\" for unpopular decisions, allowing the monarch to remain unscathed. Which is why their downfall is almost inevitable, and has been so ever since the execution of Sejanus, the supposedly untouchable chief minister of the Emperor Tiberius. Piers Gaveston was killed, as was the 17th-century's most famous Mandelsonian figure, the Duke of Buckingham.</p> <p>Now that Mandelson has more leisure time, he may find some consolation from reading about his predecessors.

The stock has more than halved since June, when the company ranked as Europe's biggest. </p> <p>Clearly exasperated at uncertainty over the introduction of new technology and the level of consumer demand, chief executive Jorma Ollila told a news conference: \"We just don't know exactly what is going to happen. It's just not possible to predict in the same way as it was in previous years.\" </p> <p>He attributed a likely slowdown in profit growth to Nokia's strategy of \"aggressively gaining market share\", which last week forced its Scandinavian rival Ericsson to end its production of handsets and outsource the business. Nokia's handsetsaccount for a almost a third of world sales. </p> <p>Worries over GPRS and its successor, 3G or third-generation mobiles, are being heightened by falling sales of handsets. Mr Ollila said yesterday that the company, which sold 128m phones in 2000, expected the industry as a whole to shift between 500m and 550m handsets this year, retreating from predictions that global sales would top 550m units. </p> <p>\"The anticipated shift in the mobile phone industry is now taking place and market growth is gradually settling into less exceptional levels than we have seen in the near past,\" Mr Ollila said. </p> <p>Mobile phone penetration across Europe has reached 62%, but deep uncertainty remains over the pace at which consumers will switch to new handsets offering higher-speed internet access as well as voice calls. </p> <p>Motorola is the only company with a GPRS phone available. Jitters in the industry have been exacerbated by warnings such as one from Irish mobile computer chip maker Parthus, which last week claimed that the first shipment of this latest generation of handsets have a short battery life and a tendency to overheat. </p> <p>\u0095Bouygues Telecom, France's third largest mobile phone operator, yesterday pulled out of the contest for a French third-generation mobile licence - leaving only two contenders for the four licences on offer.</p>",

Shares in Nokia, which yesterday bolstered its board with the appointment of Pearson chief executive Marjorie Scardino as a non-executive, fell almost 6% to \u20ac37.60. The stock has more than halved since June, when the company ranked as Europe's biggest. Clearly exasperated at uncertainty over the introduction of new technology and the level of consumer demand, chief executive Jorma Ollila told a news conference: \"We just don't know exactly what is going to happen. It's just not possible to predict in the same way as it was in previous years.\" He attributed a likely slowdown in profit growth to Nokia's strategy of \"aggressively gaining market share\", which last week forced its Scandinavian rival Ericsson to end its production of handsets and outsource the business. Nokia's handsetsaccount for a almost a third of world sales. Worries over GPRS and its successor, 3G or third-generation mobiles, are being heightened by falling sales of handsets. Mr Ollila said yesterday that the company, which sold 128m phones in 2000, expected the industry as a whole to shift between 500m and 550m handsets this year, retreating from predictions that global sales would top 550m units. \"The anticipated shift in the mobile phone industry is now taking place and market growth is gradually settling into less exceptional levels than we have seen in the near past,\" Mr Ollila said. Mobile phone penetration across Europe has reached 62%, but deep uncertainty remains over the pace at which consumers will switch to new handsets offering higher-speed internet access as well as voice calls. Motorola is the only company with a GPRS phone available. Jitters in the industry have been exacerbated by warnings such as one from Irish mobile computer chip maker Parthus, which last week claimed that the first shipment of this latest generation of handsets have a short battery life and a tendency to overheat. \u0095Bouygues Telecom, France's third largest mobile phone operator, yesterday pulled out of the contest for a French third-generation mobile licence - leaving only two contenders for the four licences on offer.",

One person in five carries a donor card, which in the event of a fatal accident, allows doctors to use organs to save other patients' lives. But as yesterday's census by the chief medical officer (CMO), and the report of the inquiry into Liverpool's Alder Hey children's hospital, both grimly document, this goodwill has been systematically ignored by the medical profession, which has proceeded to remove organs and retain them without informed consent. </p> <p>In Liverpool and at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, where the illegal procedures were first exposed, organs were systematically removed, most of them illegally without the consent of the dead patients' relatives. Between 1988 and 1995, when autopsies at Liverpool were under the control of a Dutch pathologist, Professor Dick van Velzen, the hospital stripped the organs of over 1,000 dead babies and children, most of which were never used for medical research but just stockpiled. The professor, now on leave from a hospital post in Holland, is wanted in Canada for a similar scandal. Yesterday's report insists he must never be allowed to practise in the UK again. </p> <p>But the real scandal yesterday was less the grim story of Liverpool's rogue pathologist than the evidence of the CMO's census. This shows that illegal procedures are not restricted to just two hospitals. There are 105,000 organs retained across English hospitals, 54,000 of which were removed in the last 30 years. (Some 25 leading hospitals and medical schools account for 88%.) The report estimates that at least 16,500 have been retained in contravention of the law. As the health secretary, Alan Milburn, told the Commons: \"The current law and postmortem consent forms are both ambiguous.

Essentially the medical profession has failed to keep in tune with changing social attitudes and medical law. Part of the problem has been a misguided belief among doctors that the bereaved should not be told the truth about autopsies, when they had only just learned of the deaths of their children. Hence the deceptive consent form which talks of taking tissues, rather than organs. But this deception has eroded the most important element of medical practice: patients' trust. Part of the trouble, as the CMO conceded yesterday, has been an unwelcome residue of medical paternalism, \"belonging to an era when decisions were made for patients, not with them\". </p> <p>The medical profession is changing. Even before yesterday's proposed reforms, new guidelines for pathologists had been issued by the CMO, the British Medical Association, and the Royal College of Pathologists - together with a proposed code of conduct from the Bristol hospital inquiry. The health secretary has followed these up with a sensible package of enforceable statutory safeguards.What everyone should unite behind now is an education campaign emphasising the importance of organ donations. Even at Alder Hey, according to the report, 1,600 children alive today would have died but for the improvements in surgical techniques and care pioneered there. The bereaved parents have said that they would have donated organs, had they been asked.

Feline killers exposed A survey for the Mammal Society found that 1,000 cats killed 14,000 other animals over five months. With an estimated UK pet cat population of 9m, this gives a total of 275m victims a year, or 33 for each cat. Mice were top, the study found, then voles; few rats were killed - probably because rats fight back.",

However, this crucial information was available as long ago as December 12 1996 when I published an article in the London Review of Books, entitled The UN and Rwanda. The article was based on a leaked account, given to me, of the secret meetings of the council held while the genocide was taking place. I described Britain's role in detail in this piece.</p> <p>Robertson then goes on to say that in my recent book on the genocide I \"suggest\" parliament was misled by ministers when Labour finally forced a debate on Rwanda. This is not strictly the case and I would suggest that a great deal of care is taken regarding the timing of events. On May 9 1994 parliament was told in a written answer that \"more than 200,000 people may have perished in the recent fighting in Rwanda\". This was an extraordinary statement. By now the fact that a genocide was underway was in the public domain. Oxfam had used the word genocide in a press release. And by now the estimated death toll had reached 500,000 victims, mostly killed in organised and large scale massacres. The killing of civilians had taken place nowhere near the renewed civil war. Furthermore, Labour did not \"force a debate on Rwanda\". On May 24 a late-night adjournment debate was held thanks only to Labour MP Tony Worthington, who told an almost empty house: \"It is inconceivable that an atrocity in which half a million white people had died would not have been extensively debated in the House.\"</p> <p>Robertson kindly asserts that the case for an inquiry into British policy is \"further strengthened\" by my book, A People Betrayed. It does more than \"strengthen\" the case, it sets out in detail the security council's record of gross error and serious miscalculation. <br><b>Linda Melvern</b> <br>London <a href-\"mailto:linda@melvern.co.uk\">linda@melvern.co.uk</a></p>",

Robertson then goes on to say that in my recent book on the genocide I \"suggest\" parliament was misled by ministers when Labour finally forced a debate on Rwanda. This is not strictly the case and I would suggest that a great deal of care is taken regarding the timing of events. On May 9 1994 parliament was told in a written answer that \"more than 200,000 people may have perished in the recent fighting in Rwanda\". This was an extraordinary statement. By now the fact that a genocide was underway was in the public domain. Oxfam had used the word genocide in a press release. And by now the estimated death toll had reached 500,000 victims, mostly killed in organised and large scale massacres. The killing of civilians had taken place nowhere near the renewed civil war. Furthermore, Labour did not \"force a debate on Rwanda\". On May 24 a late-night adjournment debate was held thanks only to Labour MP Tony Worthington, who told an almost empty house: \"It is inconceivable that an atrocity in which half a million white people had died would not have been extensively debated in the House.\" Robertson kindly asserts that the case for an inquiry into British policy is \"further strengthened\" by my book, A People Betrayed. It does more than \"strengthen\" the case, it sets out in detail the security council's record of gross error and serious miscalculation. Linda Melvern London linda@melvern.co.uk",

The head of the UN administration in Mitrovice, Tony Welch, said the cycle of violence was prompted by groups of Serbs in the north of the city intent on \"testing the will of the new K-for brigade\" who arrived two weeks ago. He was referring to an incident on Saturday in which a group of Serbs shot at French troops as they intervened to protect two Albanians from being attacked. The attackers' car was traced by K-for to the Serbian national council, home of Mitrovice's Serb leadership. The building was later searched by K-for. Mr Welch said the grenade attack might have been in retaliation for the search operation. \"They know they can't go for K-for so they go for an easy target,\" he said, adding that more violence was expected if the dead Albanian boy's brother, who is critically ill, dies in hospital.",

      "body": "<p>The cabinet was brainstorming yesterday. For two and a half hours - a long time in cabinet politics - they talked manifesto. Radical or steady-as-she-goes? Great leap forward or trudging solid step-by-step? We wait to see if it will be a bold proclamation of Labour's true values or a third way shuffle, another nervous unfocused bid for an imaginary middle England. The truth about middle England is that like everyone everywhere, it harbours a host of pluralist contradictions, hopes and fears, generosities and meannesses, depending which way the question is put. It is for politicians to offer strong leadership and clear choices, drawing out the best of impulses, rejecting the worst. </p> <p>In all parties seasoned manifesto writers look back enviously to Margaret Thatcher's 1979 single pledge that was dazzlingly radical yet sublimely simple. It was the sale of council houses to their tenants. At a stroke a policy affecting relatively few voters struck a chord even among those who had never set foot in a council estate. It spoke eloquently of the best Conservative values: freedom from state servitude, upward aspiration for all, the Englishman's home as his castle, a property-owning democracy, concern for the respectable self-improving working class. It left Labour trapped in an old ideology that locked people into council housing for ever. It exposed Labour's dislike for upward mobility. A killer election-winner, Labour was toast. </p> <p>Every party is now seeking their magic carpet policy - the one totemic winner that conveys the essence of an entire ideology, the very best of all they stand for. As it happens, Labour had one delivered to its doorstep this week, though the cabinet yesterday may not have recognised this jewel in its palm. It is the universal right to affordable childcare. The national childcare commission, assembled by the Day Care Trust, chaired by Harriet Harman and including rightwing Tory MP Edward Leigh, came up with proposals that would transform life for families. </p> <p>\"Motherhood and apple pie,\" said one sceptic yesterday. Just so and why not? This is the apple-pie vision. Rolling out from the poorest places first, every district will have a neighbourhood children's centre to house playgroups, mother and toddler groups, a creche, a nursery, antenatal clinics, health visitors, Sure Start programmes, after-school clubs and homework clubs for older children - a home from home with all children's services in one place. Imagine a state of the art, beautiful building as a hub for the local community where parents assemble regularly, breathing new life into community activity. Isolated mothers meet here to learn and train with New Deal advisers to find them jobs. </p> <p>\"Blue sky thinking is very useful,\" said one tentative but wistful Labour minister, keen but anxious about the cost. It would be very expensive - 8,000 centres at \u00a310bn or more. Add to that the cost of the commission's other radical proposal - that every mother should be allowed to draw down the cost of childcare for the first three years, and either keep it to stay at home or spend it on a creche or childminder. Currently low-paid working mothers can claim up to \u00a370 childcare a week - a sum that could be there for all to work or not. What the commission report shows -blindingly obvious to anyone who bothered to ask - is that even mothers high up the social scale (Daily Mail middle England heartland) struggle miserably with the lack of childcare, high cost and hard to find. It causes desperate anxiety to most of the 75% of mothers who now go out to work. Commissioners listened to women cry as they reported handing over tiny babies to minders they didn't trust to go back to long hours to pay their mortgages. At the same time 65% of mothers who stay at home want to work but can't find or fund the childcare. The current system where the state subsidises anyone but the mother to care for a child makes no sense: choice is all. </p> <p>Childcare is the gaping hole in the cradle-to-grave welfare state. Like health and education it cannot be provided privately: at \u00a3180 a week it is way beyond most pockets. There is no other solution but public provision. For years the Tories tried to get employers and the private sector to do it, but it never worked. Left-behind Britain still thinks it is not the state's business, though Germany, France, Italy, Denmark and the others have had excellent nurseries for decades. Founding the NHS was a monumental public good -very expensive, very daring and very popular. By promising a radical expansion of the welfare state, Labour would underline its profound belief in public services for those things that the private sector cannot do. </p> <p>Politically, it would trump the Tories. They plan tax incentives for marriage as their family policy. Universal children's centres would be far too expensive for them. Copying Labour spending on health and education (though for how long?), they could not pretend to follow here. A high spending, high profile promise is just what Labour needs. It would leave them floundering - and voters with a clear choice. Tiny tax incentives for marriage will look pathetic beside a mighty promise for what families really need. </p> <p>Today the Institute for Fiscal Studies green budget will probably again discover the chancellor's surplus is far greater than he admits. \"Surplus, what surplus?\" Gordon Brown says crossly when anyone asks. But he is sitting on more than enough to pay for universal childcare. As Michael Jacobs of the Fabians wrote in these pages, we are \u00a345bn underspent by the EU average. The government does have a national childcare strategy already spending sizeable sums, but with negligible political impact. It has no brand and no resonance, with excellent programmes but so far only for the poor. To promise a universal system for every baby and child would be a very different matter. If people don't know about Labour's childcare, that is because inheriting virtually none there is still only one childcare place (private or public) for every seven young children and after-school club places for only one in 14 school children. </p> <p>Will it happen? The cabinet doesn't quite get its powerful potential. One obstacle, as ever, is stone-age David Blunkett who yesterday left Labour MPs spitting with fury when he said he opposed any further help as it might encourage young girls to have babies. Thinking he'd been misquoted, I checked, but his office was adamant: that is his fixed view. Under-fives' minister, Margaret Hodge, on the other hand, was touring the studios giving broad encouragement to children's centres - a natural extension of what she is doing. Will they see that universal childcare is the magic family policy the Tories can never match? </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

It was the sale of council houses to their tenants. At a stroke a policy affecting relatively few voters struck a chord even among those who had never set foot in a council estate. It spoke eloquently of the best Conservative values: freedom from state servitude, upward aspiration for all, the Englishman's home as his castle, a property-owning democracy, concern for the respectable self-improving working class. It left Labour trapped in an old ideology that locked people into council housing for ever. It exposed Labour's dislike for upward mobility. A killer election-winner, Labour was toast. Every party is now seeking their magic carpet policy - the one totemic winner that conveys the essence of an entire ideology, the very best of all they stand for. As it happens, Labour had one delivered to its doorstep this week, though the cabinet yesterday may not have recognised this jewel in its palm. It is the universal right to affordable childcare. The national childcare commission, assembled by the Day Care Trust, chaired by Harriet Harman and including rightwing Tory MP Edward Leigh, came up with proposals that would transform life for families. \"Motherhood and apple pie,\" said one sceptic yesterday. Just so and why not? This is the apple-pie vision. Rolling out from the poorest places first, every district will have a neighbourhood children's centre to house playgroups, mother and toddler groups, a creche, a nursery, antenatal clinics, health visitors, Sure Start programmes, after-school clubs and homework clubs for older children - a home from home with all children's services in one place. Imagine a state of the art, beautiful building as a hub for the local community where parents assemble regularly, breathing new life into community activity. Isolated mothers meet here to learn and train with New Deal advisers to find them jobs. \"Blue sky thinking is very useful,\" said one tentative but wistful Labour minister, keen but anxious about the cost. It would be very expensive - 8,000 centres at \u00a310bn or more. Add to that the cost of the commission's other radical proposal - that every mother should be allowed to draw down the cost of childcare for the first three years, and either keep it to stay at home or spend it on a creche or childminder. Currently low-paid working mothers can claim up to \u00a370 childcare a week - a sum that could be there for all to work or not. What the commission report shows -blindingly obvious to anyone who bothered to ask - is that even mothers high up the social scale (Daily Mail middle England heartland) struggle miserably with the lack of childcare, high cost and hard to find. It causes desperate anxiety to most of the 75% of mothers who now go out to work. Commissioners listened to women cry as they reported handing over tiny babies to minders they didn't trust to go back to long hours to pay their mortgages. At the same time 65% of mothers who stay at home want to work but can't find or fund the childcare. The current system where the state subsidises anyone but the mother to care for a child makes no sense: choice is all. Childcare is the gaping hole in the cradle-to-grave welfare state. Like health and education it cannot be provided privately: at \u00a3180 a week it is way beyond most pockets. There is no other solution but public provision. For years the Tories tried to get employers and the private sector to do it, but it never worked. Left-behind Britain still thinks it is not the state's business, though Germany, France, Italy, Denmark and the others have had excellent nurseries for decades. Founding the NHS was a monumental public good -very expensive, very daring and very popular. By promising a radical expansion of the welfare state, Labour would underline its profound belief in public services for those things that the private sector cannot do. Politically, it would trump the Tories. They plan tax incentives for marriage as their family policy. Universal children's centres would be far too expensive for them. Copying Labour spending on health and education (though for how long?), they could not pretend to follow here. A high spending, high profile promise is just what Labour needs. It would leave them floundering - and voters with a clear choice. Tiny tax incentives for marriage will look pathetic beside a mighty promise for what families really need. Today the Institute for Fiscal Studies green budget will probably again discover the chancellor's surplus is far greater than he admits. \"Surplus, what surplus?\" Gordon Brown says crossly when anyone asks. But he is sitting on more than enough to pay for universal childcare. As Michael Jacobs of the Fabians wrote in these pages, we are \u00a345bn underspent by the EU average. The government does have a national childcare strategy already spending sizeable sums, but with negligible political impact. It has no brand and no resonance, with excellent programmes but so far only for the poor. To promise a universal system for every baby and child would be a very different matter. If people don't know about Labour's childcare, that is because inheriting virtually none there is still only one childcare place (private or public) for every seven young children and after-school club places for only one in 14 school children. Will it happen? The cabinet doesn't quite get its powerful potential. One obstacle, as ever, is stone-age David Blunkett who yesterday left Labour MPs spitting with fury when he said he opposed any further help as it might encourage young girls to have babies. Thinking he'd been misquoted, I checked, but his office was adamant: that is his fixed view. Under-fives' minister, Margaret Hodge, on the other hand, was touring the studios giving broad encouragement to children's centres - a natural extension of what she is doing. Will they see that universal childcare is the magic family policy the Tories can never match? polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>Amazon.com, the leading online retailer, is expected to announce imminently a cost-cutting plan which could involve significant job losses. </p> <p>Rumours that Amazon would cut as many as 20% of its 9,000-strong worldwide workforce have spread through the company's Seattle headquarters and internet chatrooms in the past few days. </p> <p>Few analysts expect the cuts to be as deep as feared, however. The company sacked 150 people a year ago, its first ever round of job cuts. </p> <p>Bill Curry, a spokesman for Amazon, declined to comment before the release of fourth-quarter results last night. \"We never respond to rumours about what may or may not happen,\" he said. The company demanded that one newswire retract a story that it had denied the job cuts. </p> <p>Several Wall Street analysts expected the company to announce cost-cutting measures at the same time as lower revenues for the current year. Jeetil Patel, of Deutsche Bank Alex Brown, said Amazon needed to cut operating expenses to reach profitability by 2002. \"The deeper the operat ing expense reductions, the better they will be regarded by Wall Street,\" he said. </p> <p>Amazon could also cut certain product lines and close some of its eight distribution facilities in the US, he said. However, such retrenchment would represent a significant shift from the company's much-vaunted business model, which reinvests any funding in further expansion. </p> <p>The job cuts, if announced, are expected to focus on distribution centres in the US as well as other back-office functions. Tim Albright, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said: \"There are a lot of temporary employees whose jobs won't be around in the next six months.\" </p> <p>Since the 150 job cuts a year ago, Amazon has reorganised one distribution centre by relocating most of the staff. Several customer service representatives have begun a drive to unionise the company. </p> <p>The pressure to cut costs reflects the fact that most analysts expect Amazon's 2001 sales to be lower than the $4bn (\u00a32.74bn) they envisaged three months ago.

      "bodyText": "Amazon.com, the leading online retailer, is expected to announce imminently a cost-cutting plan which could involve significant job losses. Rumours that Amazon would cut as many as 20% of its 9,000-strong worldwide workforce have spread through the company's Seattle headquarters and internet chatrooms in the past few days. Few analysts expect the cuts to be as deep as feared, however. The company sacked 150 people a year ago, its first ever round of job cuts. Bill Curry, a spokesman for Amazon, declined to comment before the release of fourth-quarter results last night. \"We never respond to rumours about what may or may not happen,\" he said. The company demanded that one newswire retract a story that it had denied the job cuts. Several Wall Street analysts expected the company to announce cost-cutting measures at the same time as lower revenues for the current year. Jeetil Patel, of Deutsche Bank Alex Brown, said Amazon needed to cut operating expenses to reach profitability by 2002. \"The deeper the operat ing expense reductions, the better they will be regarded by Wall Street,\" he said. Amazon could also cut certain product lines and close some of its eight distribution facilities in the US, he said. However, such retrenchment would represent a significant shift from the company's much-vaunted business model, which reinvests any funding in further expansion. The job cuts, if announced, are expected to focus on distribution centres in the US as well as other back-office functions. Tim Albright, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said: \"There are a lot of temporary employees whose jobs won't be around in the next six months.\" Since the 150 job cuts a year ago, Amazon has reorganised one distribution centre by relocating most of the staff. Several customer service representatives have begun a drive to unionise the company. The pressure to cut costs reflects the fact that most analysts expect Amazon's 2001 sales to be lower than the $4bn (\u00a32.74bn) they envisaged three months ago. Some analysts have reduced this year's revenue forecasts to between $3.6bn and $3.8bn amid signs of an economic slowdown.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At Liverpool's Lime Street station I ask the way to the Playhouse. \"Williamson Square,\" a man says cheerfully. \"The Playhouse is at the heart of the city. Nice to hear it's open again.\" </p> <p>The Playhouse may be at the heart of Liverpool, but when it finally went into liquidation in 1998 after a decade of financial problems, few imagined that it would ever open again. One of Britain's oldest repertory theatres, founded in an old music hall in 1911, was history. </p> <p>Not any more. Just before Christmas, the Playhouse reopened its doors after a \u00a31.5m EU-funded refurbishment. That was the easy part. Now the hard work begins under the direction of Jo Beddoe, a jolly but steely woman who was enticed back to Britain from New York's Theatre Workshop to head the newly created trust that brings the Playhouse and the Everyman, Liverpool's other main theatre, together under one administration. </p> <p>Beddoe is no stranger to the city. She was a teacher here in the 1960s and the administrator of the Playhouse in more glorious times when Liverpool's theatres were awash with home-grown talents such as Willy Russell and Alan Bleasdale. </p> <p>But she knows that the theatres cannot live on their pasts, and has appointed Robert Delamere and James Kerr, two young directors with growing national reputations, to deliver the trust's artistic ambitions. Only after she gave them their jobs did she discover that both came from Liverpool. All very auspicious - as is the talk of finding new ways of running regional theatre and attracting new audiences. One imagines that Beddoe might personally go out on to the street and drag them in if needed. </p> <p>Beddoe is canny enough to know that there is far more than just her own and her associate directors' reputations riding on the success of the Playhouse and Everyman. Every major regional theatre in the country will be watching what happens in Liverpool. If she can successfully throw away the rule book, why can't others? </p> <p>Already the past couple of years has thrown up intriguing new models of how regional reps can operate. In the ensemble-led companies in Newcastle and Colchester, for instance, the notion of theatres as cultural palaces has given way to a set-up where art, education and community are intimately entwined. </p> <p>Coming fresh from an American theatre culture where, as she puts it, \"the only thing that matters is the work\", Beddoe will be resisting regional theatre's propensity to be funding-led. \"Funding bodies tend to find it hard to say that the work is good or bad. But they do say, 'We're going to cut you because your marketing strategy or your audience development or your business plan isn't good enough.' \" </p> <p>If the Playhouse had reopened a couple of years back, one might have wondered whether, with regional theatre in such crisis, it might have been better to let the dead rest in peace and concentrate on saving those theatres still showing signs of life. </p> <p>But last year's Boyden report into the state of British theatre, and Gerry Robinson's subsequent success in wresting money from the government, have changed all that. Beddoe is disappointed to discover that not all of the initial \u00a325m will be going to the regional reps. \"We had hoped it would all go to the regions. It would have given the regional theatres a chance to solve their problems and then to become lobbyists on behalf the rest of the theatre ecology. </p> <p>\"The danger is that if they don't put sufficient money into regional theatre, they will in effect be funding us to fail again, and if we fail then the rest of theatre - touring, small scale, new writing - will go down when we go down.\" </p> <p>But Beddoe is not interested in playing Cassandra. She's got more important things to do, such as opening the Playhouse and Everyman seasons that include Kerr's production of Twelfth Night, Delamere's production of Playboy of the Western World and visits from top touring outfits such as Out of Joint and Shared Experience. </p> <p>But if the Playhouse's success is important to regional theatre, it is crucial to the future of Liverpool. At the moment the city is in a state of complete transformation. The waterfront is receiving a \u00a3200m facelift and hotels are springing up. Just before Christmas the city's first \u00a31m apartment was sold. The city centre population, which fell to under 3,000 in the 1990s, is on the up. </p> <p>This financial buoyancy is also reflected in a cultural optimism of which the Playhouse is the most obvious symbol. A vast \u00a325m has been spent on art galleries, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic has received \u00a35m in stabilisation funding, and both the city council and Northwest Arts have thrown themselves behind the new administration at the Playhouse and Everyman. Liverpool is busy preparing its bid to be European City of Culture in 2008 and an attempt is well advanced to have the city twinned with New York. </p> <p>It used to be the case that the further Scousers got away from Liverpool, the more they loved the city. But Beddoe, Delamere and Kerr are a sign of the changing times. Like the Playhouse, they came back. </p> <p>\u0095 Twelfth Night is at Liverpool Playhouse from tomorrow.

      "bodyText": "At Liverpool's Lime Street station I ask the way to the Playhouse. \"Williamson Square,\" a man says cheerfully. \"The Playhouse is at the heart of the city. Nice to hear it's open again.\" The Playhouse may be at the heart of Liverpool, but when it finally went into liquidation in 1998 after a decade of financial problems, few imagined that it would ever open again. One of Britain's oldest repertory theatres, founded in an old music hall in 1911, was history. Not any more. Just before Christmas, the Playhouse reopened its doors after a \u00a31.5m EU-funded refurbishment. That was the easy part. Now the hard work begins under the direction of Jo Beddoe, a jolly but steely woman who was enticed back to Britain from New York's Theatre Workshop to head the newly created trust that brings the Playhouse and the Everyman, Liverpool's other main theatre, together under one administration. Beddoe is no stranger to the city. She was a teacher here in the 1960s and the administrator of the Playhouse in more glorious times when Liverpool's theatres were awash with home-grown talents such as Willy Russell and Alan Bleasdale. But she knows that the theatres cannot live on their pasts, and has appointed Robert Delamere and James Kerr, two young directors with growing national reputations, to deliver the trust's artistic ambitions. Only after she gave them their jobs did she discover that both came from Liverpool. All very auspicious - as is the talk of finding new ways of running regional theatre and attracting new audiences. One imagines that Beddoe might personally go out on to the street and drag them in if needed. Beddoe is canny enough to know that there is far more than just her own and her associate directors' reputations riding on the success of the Playhouse and Everyman. Every major regional theatre in the country will be watching what happens in Liverpool. If she can successfully throw away the rule book, why can't others? Already the past couple of years has thrown up intriguing new models of how regional reps can operate. In the ensemble-led companies in Newcastle and Colchester, for instance, the notion of theatres as cultural palaces has given way to a set-up where art, education and community are intimately entwined. Coming fresh from an American theatre culture where, as she puts it, \"the only thing that matters is the work\", Beddoe will be resisting regional theatre's propensity to be funding-led. \"Funding bodies tend to find it hard to say that the work is good or bad. But they do say, 'We're going to cut you because your marketing strategy or your audience development or your business plan isn't good enough.' \" If the Playhouse had reopened a couple of years back, one might have wondered whether, with regional theatre in such crisis, it might have been better to let the dead rest in peace and concentrate on saving those theatres still showing signs of life. But last year's Boyden report into the state of British theatre, and Gerry Robinson's subsequent success in wresting money from the government, have changed all that. Beddoe is disappointed to discover that not all of the initial \u00a325m will be going to the regional reps. \"We had hoped it would all go to the regions. It would have given the regional theatres a chance to solve their problems and then to become lobbyists on behalf the rest of the theatre ecology. \"The danger is that if they don't put sufficient money into regional theatre, they will in effect be funding us to fail again, and if we fail then the rest of theatre - touring, small scale, new writing - will go down when we go down.\" But Beddoe is not interested in playing Cassandra. She's got more important things to do, such as opening the Playhouse and Everyman seasons that include Kerr's production of Twelfth Night, Delamere's production of Playboy of the Western World and visits from top touring outfits such as Out of Joint and Shared Experience. But if the Playhouse's success is important to regional theatre, it is crucial to the future of Liverpool. At the moment the city is in a state of complete transformation. The waterfront is receiving a \u00a3200m facelift and hotels are springing up. Just before Christmas the city's first \u00a31m apartment was sold. The city centre population, which fell to under 3,000 in the 1990s, is on the up. This financial buoyancy is also reflected in a cultural optimism of which the Playhouse is the most obvious symbol. A vast \u00a325m has been spent on art galleries, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic has received \u00a35m in stabilisation funding, and both the city council and Northwest Arts have thrown themselves behind the new administration at the Playhouse and Everyman. Liverpool is busy preparing its bid to be European City of Culture in 2008 and an attempt is well advanced to have the city twinned with New York. It used to be the case that the further Scousers got away from Liverpool, the more they loved the city. But Beddoe, Delamere and Kerr are a sign of the changing times. Like the Playhouse, they came back. \u0095 Twelfth Night is at Liverpool Playhouse from tomorrow. Box office: 0151-709 4776.",

      "body": "<p>People seeking asylum are among some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Often fleeing persecution and sometimes torture, they should not be placed in accommodation where they are subject to harassment or appalling conditions. Shelter believes everyone should be able to live in a home that is decent. We work to ensure that all homeless people have housing that meets their needs and does not place their health or welfare at risk.</p> <p>In establishing a national service to deal with the needs of asylum seekers, the government sought to ensure that responsibility was shared by local authorities throughout the country. However, a balance must be struck between providing a national response to the needs of people who flee to this country requiring refuge and support, and the importance of planning for and providing housing at a local level. </p> <p>By highlighting the appalling housing conditions of people seeking asylum in this country, Shelter has illustrated what can go wrong when local councils lose strategic control of the housing being provided for homeless people in their areas. By allowing the responsibility for housing destitute asylum seekers to fall, first, to local social services departments and then to a National Asylum Support Service, the strategic role of local housing departments in the provision of housing for homeless people has been bypassed.</p> <p>Shelter has greatly welcomed the proposals in the current homes bill that local authorities will have to formulate strategies for ensuring that sufficient accommodation and support will be available for homeless people in their district. But, if such strategies are to be realistic and effective, it is essential that they are not undermined by the arrangements being made nationally. </p> <p>Transporting homeless asylum seekers to provincial areas, without involving the relevant local authorities in planning for and monitoring accommodation, creates problems. Without the participation and support of local people, via councils and local agencies, asylum seekers housed in this way will be left feeling unwelcome, isolated and vulnerable. </p> <p>Local involvement is particularly important when the majority of accommodation being contracted by the Home Office is from private landlords, often through sub-contracting arrangements. Owing to the ineffective regulation of private rented housing, the worst accommodation in the sector is dangerous and unhealthy. In response, a number of proactive local councils have made huge efforts in recent years to improve the standards of private rented housing in their areas. </p> <p>There are examples of good practice. The best strategies have taken a two-pronged approach: encourage and work with those landlords who are interested in providing decent accommodation, and take strong action against those who ignore minimum standards. Some areas had started to reap the benefits of such approaches to the point where the worst landlords were being driven out of business. </p> <p>But there is a danger that these improvements will be undermined by the new system: by sub-contracting housing from local landlords without working closely with local councils, the Home Office is in danger of providing a steady flow of occupants to the very death traps that local councils were trying to close down.</p> <p>Shelter has long campaigned for the introduction of legislation requiring private landlords, and particularly those providing houses for multiple occupation, to be licensed in order to let accommodation. This would place the responsibility on landlords to inform local authorities about the dwellings they are letting, and should make it much easier for standards to be inspected and enforced. Shelter hopes to see such legislation - which has been supported by all three main parties - introduced in the next Queen's Speech.</p> <p>If the Home Office is to continue to rely on private rented accommodation to house the majority of asylum seekers, it is vital that legislation to license private lettings is introduced as a matter of extreme urgency. In the meantime, Shelter would like to see an urgent and thorough review of the accommodation and support provided to asylum seekers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "People seeking asylum are among some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Often fleeing persecution and sometimes torture, they should not be placed in accommodation where they are subject to harassment or appalling conditions. Shelter believes everyone should be able to live in a home that is decent. We work to ensure that all homeless people have housing that meets their needs and does not place their health or welfare at risk. In establishing a national service to deal with the needs of asylum seekers, the government sought to ensure that responsibility was shared by local authorities throughout the country. However, a balance must be struck between providing a national response to the needs of people who flee to this country requiring refuge and support, and the importance of planning for and providing housing at a local level. By highlighting the appalling housing conditions of people seeking asylum in this country, Shelter has illustrated what can go wrong when local councils lose strategic control of the housing being provided for homeless people in their areas. By allowing the responsibility for housing destitute asylum seekers to fall, first, to local social services departments and then to a National Asylum Support Service, the strategic role of local housing departments in the provision of housing for homeless people has been bypassed. Shelter has greatly welcomed the proposals in the current homes bill that local authorities will have to formulate strategies for ensuring that sufficient accommodation and support will be available for homeless people in their district. But, if such strategies are to be realistic and effective, it is essential that they are not undermined by the arrangements being made nationally. Transporting homeless asylum seekers to provincial areas, without involving the relevant local authorities in planning for and monitoring accommodation, creates problems. Without the participation and support of local people, via councils and local agencies, asylum seekers housed in this way will be left feeling unwelcome, isolated and vulnerable. Local involvement is particularly important when the majority of accommodation being contracted by the Home Office is from private landlords, often through sub-contracting arrangements. Owing to the ineffective regulation of private rented housing, the worst accommodation in the sector is dangerous and unhealthy. In response, a number of proactive local councils have made huge efforts in recent years to improve the standards of private rented housing in their areas. There are examples of good practice. The best strategies have taken a two-pronged approach: encourage and work with those landlords who are interested in providing decent accommodation, and take strong action against those who ignore minimum standards. Some areas had started to reap the benefits of such approaches to the point where the worst landlords were being driven out of business. But there is a danger that these improvements will be undermined by the new system: by sub-contracting housing from local landlords without working closely with local councils, the Home Office is in danger of providing a steady flow of occupants to the very death traps that local councils were trying to close down. Shelter has long campaigned for the introduction of legislation requiring private landlords, and particularly those providing houses for multiple occupation, to be licensed in order to let accommodation. This would place the responsibility on landlords to inform local authorities about the dwellings they are letting, and should make it much easier for standards to be inspected and enforced. Shelter hopes to see such legislation - which has been supported by all three main parties - introduced in the next Queen's Speech. If the Home Office is to continue to rely on private rented accommodation to house the majority of asylum seekers, it is vital that legislation to license private lettings is introduced as a matter of extreme urgency. In the meantime, Shelter would like to see an urgent and thorough review of the accommodation and support provided to asylum seekers.",

Quite a lot, according to Ivan Annibal, of Lincolnshire county council's development unit. Wage rates are 20% lower than elsewhere; the top rate for piecework in food processing is \u00a35 an hour.

Community health, social care and education teams are familiar with long distances when visiting isolated clients.

It also wants to persuade the government to set up a fund for redistribution of the equivalent of 5% of fuel duty paid by local residents, to go on economic regeneration. </p> <p>Such goals seem audacious.

But this, at the moment, is merely one of many ideas which the planners are discussing. Right now, a winter crop of admirable intentions is being sown in this sparse bit of Lincolnshire. But the biggest force for change will be the locals raising their demands, declaring that living in a quiet part of the country need not mean existing in a backwater.",

Though Timothy Hornsby is witty enough to ad lib in a Sheridan classic, his role is Lord Bountiful, presiding over the process of deciding which voluntary organisations get lottery grants.

Figures, however, give no idea of the order that had to be created out of chaos when the scheme started in 1995; or of the controversies - and satisfactions - along the way. </p> <p>They began with a Niagara of applications. Mr Hornsby recalls: \"We looked at all these bloody milk crates stacked up to the ceiling and said: 'How on earth are we going to get out of this any half-decent grants in the end?'\" Sir David Sieff, then board chairman, insisted that money should flow within three months - the first birthday of the lottery - or critics \"would be on to us like hounds on a dying stag\". </p> <p>Mr Hornsby, who graduated with a first in modern history from Oxford, and spent 30 years as a civil service high-flyer, has a pride in fulfilling his brief. When the national audit office later looked at the first round of grants, it concluded that the overwhelming number had been effective. \"We had a number of casualties, but it was remarkably small,\" he recalled. \"Two or three per cent don't go into full implementation; rather like small business start-ups.\" </p> <p>He relishes some of the \"absolutely off the wall\" applications for money. His favourite was a bid from an ex-nun, convinced that western Europe was going to be wiped out by an asteroid shower as divine punishment for human wickedness. Her solution - \"the delivery mechanism\", said Mr Hornsby, parodying the jargon - was to ask for funding to put full-page advertisements in the media telling everyone to mend their ways.

He recalled that a colleague pointed out: \"If she's right, what more effective use of our money?\" So they gave it a proper assessment; no grant, though. </p> <p>Many more down-to-earth projects have pinned hopes on big and, critically, on-going lottery fund assistance. What about the tricky matter of the much resented three-year funding limit? </p> <p>\"I'd really like to see if there isn't a way of eliminating a bit of the ritual hypocrisy you're faced with,\" Mr Hornsby said. \"People say to us: 'Three years, we'll pretty much crack this; then we'll get lots of funds from elsewhere.' But in our heart of hearts, we both know it's optimistic; we collude with each other.\" There is a case for 10 or 15 year grants in some instances, he reckons, but such a reform will be a campaign for his successor. </p> <p>While Mr Hornsby has been on the receiving end of much tabloid ire over grants for gays and lesbians, asylum seekers and travellers, he has at least been spared the media cosh over big spending. The average charities board pay-out is \u00a3150,000 - modest compared with millions for a theatre or stadium - and the board looks for no-frills applications. \"It's no good,\" he said, \"saying to us: 'Sue, Grabbit, Ripoff and Runne have filled in our application form.'\" </p> <p>There was a time when Mr Hornsby regarded ministers as a bit like Sue and Co. That was in 1998 when they added the sixth good cause - the new opportunities fund (NOF), breaching (as some would see it) the principle that lottery cash should not be used as a substitute for state spending. The NOF now gets one-third of the kitty. </p> <p>He still wonders if some of the health and education projects that NOF picks up should really be a government responsibility. \"I think the jury's out on that,\" he reflected. \"Some NOF schemes are the sort of things we used to fund; but some of the stuff, it seems to me, gets close to the knuckle - MRI scanners in hospitals; the training of teachers on IT.\" </p> <p>There is also performance rivalry with sister funds for arts, heritage and sports, admits Mr Hornsby. \"We normally come top in the monitoring - well, top equal with Sport England. </p> <p>\"They're a funny bunch in Sport England.

Perhaps, according to the rule of thirds, one in three units falls into this category.

But one summer, as part of an independent team reviewing one such episode, three things struck me. </p> <p>The first was that nearly everyone involved, at every level of the organisation, seemed decent, honourable, hard working and kind. The second impression was of the pain caused to staff by the process of independent review. A pall of misery hung over the reviewers as well; I felt tainted. But the main impression was one of mystery. If my impression is correct that almost all NHS staff are basically kind, how does the culture in a unit develop in so deviant a way and why do remarkably similar episodes continue to happen across the country? </p> <p>I now think that abuse - in the original meaning of the word as \"using incorrectly or improperly\" - is not just in isolated pockets in the NHS, but widespread in the service and beyond. NHS staff dealing with dementia, and perhaps others too, are at risk of abusing because they themselves are continually abused. </p> <p>They are abused by being obliged to work in inadequate buildings, in inadequate numbers, with inadequate support, inadequate disciplinary boundaries, and inadequate training. They deal with patients with dreadful, progressive disorders who present emotional challenges often ignored. Working with inadequate numbers of colleagues is the worst abuse. Staff want to do their best, but they rarely can because there is no economy of scale in personal care and attention. </p> <p>Who is abusing the staff? Their managers. Why? Because they are abused, too. Again, they are given huge responsibilities, inadequate support and inadequate training; task after task is piled on them by their superiors, often in a very strong, \"no whinge\" culture. Judged almost entirely by their budgetary control, they strive to please by constant working and reworking of \"skill-mix\", whittling down the number and quality of their staff. </p> <p>Who is abusing the managers? Trust boards. Why? Because they are abused, too. Purchaser, regional and NHS executive imperatives pour down, each priority being piled on others. Now, impossibly, \"clinical governance\" joins responsibility for the quality of treatment and care to its opposite - cheapness. Trust chief executives who show a regional chief executive anything other than calm competence in the face of chaos are not destined for greatness. </p> <p>Who is abusing the NHS executive? Ministers. And who is abusing them? Press and MPs. And who is buying the newspapers and voting? We are, and it is our relatives who are abused by NHS staff. Thus does the wheel of abuse turn. </p> <p>Why, then, is any unit ever free of abuse? My optimism about NHS frontline staff as basically decent and well-meaning extends to all those involved in this chain, including ministers and even the press. </p> <p>If all this is right, what can we do? Perhaps We are so immured in abuse we don't know when we're being abused, let alone when we are abusing others. The first step may be to speak up when we feel abused. Whingeing? Perhaps, but there are worse crimes. We should resist passing on abuse ourselves, if necessary by deceit. Subversive? Arguably, but there are worse crimes. Finally, we must praise more, vote for polite parties, and eschew abusive newspapers and TV. We won't reduce the risk of extreme collective abuse by fiddling with the system; only by increasing resistance to it. </p> <p>\u0095 Alastair Macdonald is professor of old age psychiatry at Guy's, King's and St Thomas's Medical Schools, London.

Perhaps We are so immured in abuse we don't know when we're being abused, let alone when we are abusing others. The first step may be to speak up when we feel abused. Whingeing? Perhaps, but there are worse crimes. We should resist passing on abuse ourselves, if necessary by deceit. Subversive? Arguably, but there are worse crimes. Finally, we must praise more, vote for polite parties, and eschew abusive newspapers and TV. We won't reduce the risk of extreme collective abuse by fiddling with the system; only by increasing resistance to it. \u0095 Alastair Macdonald is professor of old age psychiatry at Guy's, King's and St Thomas's Medical Schools, London.

So determined were the police to block out the voices of dissent that the mighty now conduct their discussions behind police barricades that spread for miles through the valley. </p> <p>As outside the halls of Davos, so inside, where the meetings were closed to the public, with just a few carefully chosen non-government groups and individuals invited to address the delegates, who were mainly male, north American and European. This year, one World Economic Forum (WEF) delegate suggested that if our world was visited by beings from outer space, then the elite gathered in Davos should be responsible for speaking for humanity. If Planet Earth had a board of directors, this would be it. </p> <p>The WEF is the deeply influential international club for big business. Its past political successes include starting the Uruguay round of the Gatt, and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Most of globalisation's leading players were there. Sir John Browne and Mark Moody-Stuart, of BP and Shell, rubbed shoulders with the heads of state of the main oil producing nations. Yet these architects of globalisation are clearly worried, not so much by the protesters in the street but the new ideas emerging from dozens of citizens' movements from all over the world. The comfort once found in the old ideas is crumbling, and their rhetoric of growth, markets, liberalisation and competition - still reassuringly exchanged between the executives and leading public figures - was not like in previous years. </p> <p>For once, there was a real sense that globalisation is in trouble, and the \"board of directors\" was neither asking the right questions nor had a clue what to do. </p> <p>How are the ecological limits of a finite planet to be respected in the face of policies designed to promote never ending growth? How is the widening gap between rich and poor to be closed when many of the signals that companies respond to are designed to reward greed? How can the needs of the 10bn people who may inhabit this world in 2050 be met without drastic changes to consumption patterns? These and other critical questions were not on the Davos agenda. </p> <p>Only Public Eye, a non-governmental group not invited to participate in the main meeting, had any answers. Hiring an asthma clinic and staging debates on trade liberalisation, corporate control and financial policy, its panels and workshops were open, and the clear message was that a new alternative economics is crystalising from the global NGO networking. It has at its core sustainable development, environmental protection and social justice. It is, people confirmed, gathering momentum in all places. </p> <p>Witness Porto Alegre, 5,000 miles away in the radical capital of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Here, running concurrently with Davos, 12,000 people were last weekend meeting for the first Social Forum. If Davos was for the elite only, this meeting of 12,000 people, of all ages and from 120 countries, was the opposite. Gathering in vast lecture halls of the Catholic University, their debate was passionate and pointed. There was a tangible sense of an emerging global movement, with a striking diversity of age, political traditions, practical experience and cultural background. </p> <p>The Porto Alegre event came at a time when the institutions of the global market face a crisis of legitimacy. The Seattle, Washington and Prague protests have triggered it by drawing public attention to organisations that have long been just bewildering initials - such as IMF, WTO, Gatt and Nafta - and to the corporations that drive them, and to the unaccountability of the politicians who go to their meetings. </p> <p>It is the economic reality, and its devastating social and ecological con sequences makes the more far-sighted members of the global elite uneasy. At Porto Alegre, the reality of how most of the world must live was presented with angry passion by the very people who are suffering it. </p> <p>Trevor Inguane, part of the South African delegation, reinforced a constant theme of the conference: that the levels of inequality and injustice are continuing to rise, and it just has to stop. He gave the latest UN figures. The 20% at the top end of the global income scale earn 86 times more than the 20% at the lower end. In 1997, the figure was 74; in the 1960s, it was 30. </p> <p>Similarly shocking figures on trade were presented. As forecast, world trade has expanded rapidly: it is now 17 times greater than 50 years ago. But, over that period, Latin America's share of world trade has gone down from 11% to 5% and Africa's from 8% to 2%. No wonder there was such contempt in the many workshops and huge plenaries of this social forum for the mantras coming from Davos that economic growth will eliminate poverty. </p> <p>Where the elite talked to the elite in Davos and danced the night away in clubs, the anger at Porto Alegre was channelled into practical organisation. Apart from exchanging information about local alternatives and how to work collectively on trade, financial institutions and sustainable production, the many movements there - such as Via Campesina, the international movement of peasant and small farmers movement, and CUT, the giant radical Brazilian trade union federation - were already planning their next actions. </p> <p>Their presence will be felt this year at Quebec for negotiations over Nafta, and at the G8 summit in Genoa. </p> <p>Most dramatically, \"the long march\" - from the Brazilian city of S\u00e3o Paulo to \"the wall of death\" separating Mexico from the US - was being planned for 2003. More people have been shot trying to enter the US at this frontier than died attempting to get through the wall dividing Berlin. \"We take their goods but they don't like our people so we are taking our people to them ourselves,\" says one of the organisers of the march. </p> <p>Some solutions were close at hand. Porto Alegre, an industrial port, is a working example of what can be achieved. The radical Brazilian Workers Party has governed the city for 12 years through a sophisticated and deeply-rooted participatory process based on neighbourhood assemblies. These decide priorities and elect delegates who must apply city-wide criteria to draw up a budget, finally agreed upon by the municipality. </p> <p>They have rid the city of corruption, led to a redistribution of wealth and earned the city a UN Habitat prize for the best governed city of the world.

The UKCC froze disciplinary action against other nurses in Scotland until the outcome was known. </p> <p>If the RCN had won the case outright, there is little doubt that the disciplinary bodies in every other part of the UK health service would have felt obliged to suspend hearings pending clarification in the courts of appeal. </p> <p>Lord Mackay of Drumadoon heard the evidence in the Scottish outer sessions in the week before Christmas and delivered his judgment last Thursday. </p> <p>He said the UKCC procedure was not an infringement of the right to a fair trial because a nurse who was disciplined by the council's professional conduct committee could appeal to the court of session in Scotland or the high court in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. That meant that no nurse could be struck off the professional register without the opportunity of a fair trial (at appeal). </p> <p>But Lord Mackay said his conclusion would have been different if he had been required to decide whether the UKCC part of the procedure gave nurses adequate protection. The council's professional conduct committee did not constitute an independent and impartial tribunal, meeting all the requirements of Article 6(1) of the Human Rights Act, when viewed on its own (without consideration of the appeal process). </p> <p>The test case was brought by the RCN on behalf of Marguerite Tehrani, a nurse charged with misconduct for failing to be in attendance at a nursing home she was in charge of in Scotland for a minimum of 35 hours a week and for failing to maintain adequate staffing levels. She denies misconduct and the judge will on Friday consider further procedure . </p> <p>Tom Bolger, RCN assistant general secretary, says: \"It is now important that the UKCC reviews its procedures as a matter of urgency in the light of the judge's observations. We must ensure that patients are put first and properly protected, while ensuring that nurses are treated fairly.\" </p> <p>A spokeswomen says the RCN will be looking for separation of the UKCC's investigatory and adjudicatory systems. </p> <p>Sue Norman, UKCC chief executive, says she is pleased with the outcome of the case. \"Our priority now is to rearrange the postponed hearings in Scotland in order to meet our obligations both to the public, whom we protect, and to practitioners, for whom we ensure fair treatment. We will study very carefully, and as a matter of urgency, the judge's observations.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A threat of imminent disciplinary chaos throughout the nursing and medical professions has been lifted by a judgment in the Scottish Court of Session, giving a not quite clean bill of health to procedures followed by the nurses' regulatory body, the UKCC. But the decision is certain to have far-reaching implications for the way nurses, doctors and others are treated when allegations are made against them. The case involved a complaint that the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting was acting as investigator, prosecutor, judge and jury in its handling of allegations of professional misconduct. The Royal College of Nursing petitioned the Scottish courts for a judicial review to test whether this infringed Article 6 of the Human Rights Act guaranteeing the opportunity of a fair trial. The UKCC froze disciplinary action against other nurses in Scotland until the outcome was known. If the RCN had won the case outright, there is little doubt that the disciplinary bodies in every other part of the UK health service would have felt obliged to suspend hearings pending clarification in the courts of appeal. Lord Mackay of Drumadoon heard the evidence in the Scottish outer sessions in the week before Christmas and delivered his judgment last Thursday. He said the UKCC procedure was not an infringement of the right to a fair trial because a nurse who was disciplined by the council's professional conduct committee could appeal to the court of session in Scotland or the high court in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. That meant that no nurse could be struck off the professional register without the opportunity of a fair trial (at appeal). But Lord Mackay said his conclusion would have been different if he had been required to decide whether the UKCC part of the procedure gave nurses adequate protection. The council's professional conduct committee did not constitute an independent and impartial tribunal, meeting all the requirements of Article 6(1) of the Human Rights Act, when viewed on its own (without consideration of the appeal process). The test case was brought by the RCN on behalf of Marguerite Tehrani, a nurse charged with misconduct for failing to be in attendance at a nursing home she was in charge of in Scotland for a minimum of 35 hours a week and for failing to maintain adequate staffing levels. She denies misconduct and the judge will on Friday consider further procedure . Tom Bolger, RCN assistant general secretary, says: \"It is now important that the UKCC reviews its procedures as a matter of urgency in the light of the judge's observations. We must ensure that patients are put first and properly protected, while ensuring that nurses are treated fairly.\" A spokeswomen says the RCN will be looking for separation of the UKCC's investigatory and adjudicatory systems. Sue Norman, UKCC chief executive, says she is pleased with the outcome of the case. \"Our priority now is to rearrange the postponed hearings in Scotland in order to meet our obligations both to the public, whom we protect, and to practitioners, for whom we ensure fair treatment. We will study very carefully, and as a matter of urgency, the judge's observations.\"",

      "byline": "Ken Collins",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Since the seas around the Galapagos support much of its ecosystem, both marine and terrestrial, the consequences of the oil spill are likely to be far reaching. While the spill in world terms is relatively small, the Galapagos archipelago is equally small (occupying an area similar to that of southern England). Sea birds diving through the oil will loose the ability to fly or swim. Even small amounts of oil on birds or other animals can be toxic when ingested while grooming. </p> <p>Along the shores and shallow waters, life exists as a thin veneer on the volcanic rock. Seaweeds and corals can be smothered, depriving dependant organisms (crabs, molluscs, sea urchins) of a food supply, or these animals may be simply poisoned by eating the oil. The low numbers of unique species make them vulnerable; for example, there are only 400 pairs of the Galapagos lava gull. </p> <p>The isolation of the Galapagos archipelago has created a natural laboratory of evolution, recognised by Charles Darwin after his visit in the 19th century. For a marine scientist, it is equally fascinating as it lies at the confluence of major ocean currents - tropical warm waters from the north, deep up-welling currents from the west, and cold Antarctic waters from the south. These last two bring in nutrients which cause plankton to grow and support a rich and diverse marine life. The land is volcanic and largely barren but supports vast numbers of birds, and other animals which depend on the sea. </p> <p>I first visited the Galapagos in the aftermath of the 1982/83 El Ni\u00f1o event and then again during the height of the 1997/98 event. These are periodic phases of warm, clear waters when the cold water input dies away, leaving the local seas devoid of food to support the dependant Galapagos animals. Birds, sea lions and marine iguanas died of starvation. Underwater, corals died because they could not withstand the high temperatures and light intensities. Such events have been occurring for thousands of years and the animals and plants seem able to recover from such natural catastrophes. </p> <p>However, the influence of man is putting an increasing additional strain on this delicate, unique ecosystem. The popularity of tourism (66,000 tourists visited in 1999) has far reaching effects. At first sight, this is well managed, with tour groups being led by trained guides along a limited number of marked trails on the islands. Much of the archipelago is a national park with restricted access. </p> <p>The higher standard of living in the Galapagos, in part derived from tourism, has attracted large numbers of immigrants. Indeed, the population is now 16,000; in 1950, it was just 1,000. This has led to increased imports of plants and animals. Imported rats, dogs, cats and goats have caused havoc with the natural ecosystem, which developed in the absence of predatory and grazing mammals. </p> <p>Successful attempts have been made to exterminate these on some islands and attention is being turned towards the eradication of exotic plants which are ousting native species, a far more costly exercise. Quarantine and inspection of imported cargoes is being implemented to stop this flow of alien species. Tourism alone provides limited employment, and immigrants have looked to the sea to support themselves, since most of the archipelago's land is unsuitable for agriculture. </p> <p>Various species - such as the grouper fish, lobsters and, most recently, sea cucumbers - have been over-fished in the pursuit of export dollars. Fishing bans have been imposed and an illegal shark fin fishery is gradually being curbed. The value of live sharks for continuous tourist diver income is worth many times that of a one-off payment for dead shark fins. </p> <p>The creation of the Galapagos marine reserve in 1999 was the result of a long struggle by many people, particularly those at the Charles Darwin Research Station, who recognised that the only way to effectively manage the reserve was with the agreement and participation of all, including the fishermen. The local small-scale fishermen actively supported the reserve concept, hoping to exclude the large, industrial fishing vessels from mainland Ecuador which are still resisting any curbing of their activities.

      "bodyText": "Since the seas around the Galapagos support much of its ecosystem, both marine and terrestrial, the consequences of the oil spill are likely to be far reaching. While the spill in world terms is relatively small, the Galapagos archipelago is equally small (occupying an area similar to that of southern England). Sea birds diving through the oil will loose the ability to fly or swim. Even small amounts of oil on birds or other animals can be toxic when ingested while grooming. Along the shores and shallow waters, life exists as a thin veneer on the volcanic rock. Seaweeds and corals can be smothered, depriving dependant organisms (crabs, molluscs, sea urchins) of a food supply, or these animals may be simply poisoned by eating the oil. The low numbers of unique species make them vulnerable; for example, there are only 400 pairs of the Galapagos lava gull. The isolation of the Galapagos archipelago has created a natural laboratory of evolution, recognised by Charles Darwin after his visit in the 19th century. For a marine scientist, it is equally fascinating as it lies at the confluence of major ocean currents - tropical warm waters from the north, deep up-welling currents from the west, and cold Antarctic waters from the south. These last two bring in nutrients which cause plankton to grow and support a rich and diverse marine life. The land is volcanic and largely barren but supports vast numbers of birds, and other animals which depend on the sea. I first visited the Galapagos in the aftermath of the 1982/83 El Ni\u00f1o event and then again during the height of the 1997/98 event. These are periodic phases of warm, clear waters when the cold water input dies away, leaving the local seas devoid of food to support the dependant Galapagos animals. Birds, sea lions and marine iguanas died of starvation. Underwater, corals died because they could not withstand the high temperatures and light intensities. Such events have been occurring for thousands of years and the animals and plants seem able to recover from such natural catastrophes. However, the influence of man is putting an increasing additional strain on this delicate, unique ecosystem. The popularity of tourism (66,000 tourists visited in 1999) has far reaching effects. At first sight, this is well managed, with tour groups being led by trained guides along a limited number of marked trails on the islands. Much of the archipelago is a national park with restricted access. The higher standard of living in the Galapagos, in part derived from tourism, has attracted large numbers of immigrants. Indeed, the population is now 16,000; in 1950, it was just 1,000. This has led to increased imports of plants and animals. Imported rats, dogs, cats and goats have caused havoc with the natural ecosystem, which developed in the absence of predatory and grazing mammals. Successful attempts have been made to exterminate these on some islands and attention is being turned towards the eradication of exotic plants which are ousting native species, a far more costly exercise. Quarantine and inspection of imported cargoes is being implemented to stop this flow of alien species. Tourism alone provides limited employment, and immigrants have looked to the sea to support themselves, since most of the archipelago's land is unsuitable for agriculture. Various species - such as the grouper fish, lobsters and, most recently, sea cucumbers - have been over-fished in the pursuit of export dollars. Fishing bans have been imposed and an illegal shark fin fishery is gradually being curbed. The value of live sharks for continuous tourist diver income is worth many times that of a one-off payment for dead shark fins. The creation of the Galapagos marine reserve in 1999 was the result of a long struggle by many people, particularly those at the Charles Darwin Research Station, who recognised that the only way to effectively manage the reserve was with the agreement and participation of all, including the fishermen. The local small-scale fishermen actively supported the reserve concept, hoping to exclude the large, industrial fishing vessels from mainland Ecuador which are still resisting any curbing of their activities. Limited fishing for sea cucumbers and lobsters was permitted last year. But local lobster fishermen soon exceeded their initial and extended quotas. Last December, they rioted when told to stop, destroying scientific and park offices. This temporary breakdown of local management of the Galapagos fishery has serious consequences for the future livelihood of the local population. This oil spill has imposed yet another burden on an already stressed, delicate environment. Fortunately, it has been carried away into deeper water and is likely to be broken up before it reaches other islands with scattered impacts. The ecosystem will hopefully recover, but it will take a long time to fully understand the effects. There is a desperate need for international funds to support the oil clean-up, and to monitor and better prepare for future disasters. Ecuador is a poor country and the organisations already working to preserve the unique Galapagos environment for future generations have very limited resources.",

Lynda Shentall Manchester Crisis to come As a long time mental health survivor and former director of North-west Mind, I read with incredulity your article on the departure of Mind's chief executive (Mind's big loss, January 24). Mind faces a huge crisis, with regional offices closed down, reputation in tatters and staff morale at the lowest levels. I wish Judi Clements the best possible health, but let's not put a gloss on her leaving by denying the possibly terminal sickness of what used to be the leading mental health voluntary body. David Brandon Visiting professor of community care, Nottingham Trent University An ill wind As a former senior manager employed by Wakefield and Pontefract Community Health trust, I recall receiving a monthly list of the \"Bradford index\" absence scores for the staff I managed (Cold chills, January 24). A cartoon was printed to the right of each department area based on these scores: a happy smiling face for an \"acceptable\" score and a frowning, unhappy face for a department that had had sickness absence.

This resulted in many instances of staff attending work when they were clearly not fit to do so and spreading illness across whole departments. Name and address withheld Prescription for disaster Community pharmacists are closing down at an alarming rate, but, contrary to Alistair Yule's assertion (Letters, January 24), one of the main causes of closure in rural areas is the presence of dispensing doctors. Doctors have a statutory right to dispense if patients live more than one mile from a pharmacy, but most patients will first have to travel to a village or town to see the doctor - often passing the community pharmacy to do so. If doctors dispense, then pharmacies are deprived of a large part of income which adds to problems of competition from large multiples or supermarkets.

      "body": "<p>Wearing comedy business suits, complete with fat cigars, dark glasses and outrageous jewellery, \"Franc Suisse\", \"Mark Deutsch\" and \"Dave Dollar\" stride purposefully towards the barbed wire and lines of riot police. Surrounded by TV cameras, they walk straight into the security zone of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. </p> <p>Mingling with the chief executives of the world's biggest corporations and their invited high-level political guests, they distribute leaflets that set out alternatives to the global economy. The police finally catch on and arrest the Marx Brothers-style executives and their \"lawyer\". They are dragged out into the snow and questioned by policemen deeply embarrassed that their ring of steel was so easily penetrated. </p> <p>The action highlights how, in Davos at least, symbols count. People wearing jeans could not get within miles of the Swiss ski resort; yet suits, even comedy ones, could march straight in. So determined were the police to block out the voices of dissent that the mighty now conduct their discussions behind police barricades that spread for miles through the valley. </p> <p>As outside the halls of Davos, so inside, where the meetings were closed to the public, with just a few carefully chosen non-government groups and individuals invited to address the delegates, who were mainly male, north American and European. This year, one World Economic Forum (WEF) delegate suggested that if our world was visited by beings from outer space, then the elite gathered in Davos should be responsible for speaking for humanity. If Planet Earth had a board of directors, this would be it. </p> <p>The WEF is the deeply influential international club for big business. Its past political successes include starting the Uruguay round of the Gatt, and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Most of globalisation's leading players were there. Sir John Browne and Mark Moody-Stuart, of BP and Shell, rubbed shoul ders with the heads of state of the main oil producing nations. Yet these architects of globalisation are clearly worried, not so much by the protesters in the street but the new ideas emerging from dozens of citizens' movements from all over the world. The comfort once found in the old ideas is crumbling, and their rhetoric of growth, markets, liberalisation and competition - still reassuringly exchanged between the executives and leading public figures - was not like in previous years. </p> <p>For once, there was a real sense that globalisation is in trouble, and the \"board of directors\" was neither asking the right questions nor had a clue what to do. </p> <p>How are the ecological limits of a finite planet to be respected in the face of policies designed to promote never ending growth? How is the widening gap between rich and poor to be closed when many of the signals that companies respond to are designed to reward greed? How can the needs of the 10bn people who may inhabit this world in 2050 be met without drastic changes to consump tion patterns? These and other critical questions were not on the Davos agenda. </p> <p>Only Public Eye, a non-governmental group not invited to participate in the main meeting, had any answers. Hiring an asthma clinic and staging debates on trade liberalisation, corporate control and financial policy, its panels and workshops were open, and the clear message was that a new alternative economics is crystalising from the global NGO networking. It has at its core sustainable development, environmental protection and social justice. It is, people confirmed, gathering momentum in all places. </p> <p>Witness Porto Alegre, 5,000 miles away in the radical capital of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Here, running concurrently with Davos, 12,000 people were last weekend meeting for the first Social Forum. If Davos was for the elite only, this meeting of 12,000 people, of all ages and from 120 countries, was the opposite. Gathering in vast lecture halls of the Catholic University, their debate was passionate and pointed. There was a tangible sense of an emerging global movement, with a striking diversity of age, political traditions, practical experience and cultural background. </p> <p>The Porto Alegre event came at a time when the institutions of the global market face a crisis of legitimacy. The Seattle, Washington and Prague protests have triggered it by drawing public attention to organisations that have long been just bewildering initials - such as IMF, WTO, Gatt and Nafta - and to the corporations that drive them, and to the unaccountability of the politicians who go to their meetings. </p> <p>It is the economic reality, and its devastating social and ecological con sequences makes the more far-sighted members of the global elite uneasy. At Porto Alegre, the reality of how most of the world must live was presented with angry passion by the very people who are suffering it. </p> <p>Trevor Inguane, part of the South African delegation, reinforced a constant theme of the conference: that the levels of inequality and injustice are continuing to rise, and it just has to stop. He gave the latest UN figures. The 20% at the top end of the global income scale earn 86 times more than the 20% at the lower end. In 1997, the figure was 74; in the 1960s, it was 30. </p> <p>Similarly shocking figures on trade were presented. As forecast, world trade has expanded rapidly: it is now 17 times greater than 50 years ago. But, over that period, Latin America's share of world trade has gone down from 11% to 5% and Africa's from 8% to 2%. No wonder there was such contempt in the many workshops and huge plenaries of this social forum for the mantras coming from Davos that economic growth will eliminate poverty. </p> <p>Where the elite talked to the elite in Davos and danced the night away in clubs, the anger at Porto Alegre was channelled into practical organisation. Apart from exchanging information about local alternatives and how to work collectively on trade, financial institutions and sustainable production, the many movements there - such as Via Campesina, the international movement of peasant and small farmers movement, and CUT, the giant radical Brazilian trade union federation - were already planning their next actions. </p> <p>Their presence will be felt this year at Quebec for negotiations over Nafta, and at the G8 summit in Genoa. </p> <p>Most dramatically, \"the long march\" - from the Brazilian city of S\u00e3o Paulo to \"the wall of death\" separating Mexico from the US - was being planned for 2003. More people have been shot trying to enter the US at this frontier than died attempting to get through the wall dividing Berlin. \"We take their goods but they don't like our people so we are taking our people to them ourselves,\" says one of the organisers of the march. </p> <p>Some solutions were close at hand. Porto Alegre, an industrial port, is a working example of what can be achieved. The radical Brazilian Workers Party has governed the city for 12 years through a sophisticated and deeply-rooted participatory process based on neighbourhood assemblies. These decide priorities and elect delegates who must apply city-wide criteria to draw up a budget, finally agreed upon by the municipality. </p> <p>They have rid the city of corruption, led to a redistribution of wealth and earned the city a UN Habitat prize for the best governed city of the world. It is just one working pointer to \"another world\" in the proclamation of the forum. </p> <p>Tony Juniper is campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, UK.

He gave the latest UN figures. The 20% at the top end of the global income scale earn 86 times more than the 20% at the lower end. In 1997, the figure was 74; in the 1960s, it was 30. Similarly shocking figures on trade were presented. As forecast, world trade has expanded rapidly: it is now 17 times greater than 50 years ago. But, over that period, Latin America's share of world trade has gone down from 11% to 5% and Africa's from 8% to 2%. No wonder there was such contempt in the many workshops and huge plenaries of this social forum for the mantras coming from Davos that economic growth will eliminate poverty. Where the elite talked to the elite in Davos and danced the night away in clubs, the anger at Porto Alegre was channelled into practical organisation. Apart from exchanging information about local alternatives and how to work collectively on trade, financial institutions and sustainable production, the many movements there - such as Via Campesina, the international movement of peasant and small farmers movement, and CUT, the giant radical Brazilian trade union federation - were already planning their next actions. Their presence will be felt this year at Quebec for negotiations over Nafta, and at the G8 summit in Genoa. Most dramatically, \"the long march\" - from the Brazilian city of S\u00e3o Paulo to \"the wall of death\" separating Mexico from the US - was being planned for 2003. More people have been shot trying to enter the US at this frontier than died attempting to get through the wall dividing Berlin. \"We take their goods but they don't like our people so we are taking our people to them ourselves,\" says one of the organisers of the march. Some solutions were close at hand. Porto Alegre, an industrial port, is a working example of what can be achieved. The radical Brazilian Workers Party has governed the city for 12 years through a sophisticated and deeply-rooted participatory process based on neighbourhood assemblies. These decide priorities and elect delegates who must apply city-wide criteria to draw up a budget, finally agreed upon by the municipality. They have rid the city of corruption, led to a redistribution of wealth and earned the city a UN Habitat prize for the best governed city of the world. It is just one working pointer to \"another world\" in the proclamation of the forum. Tony Juniper is campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, UK.

      "body": "<p>Generations of Britain's miners knew only too well the dangers of blackdamp and firedamp, the gases which posed a constant risk of poisoning or explosion to those toiling underground. Working mines may now be almost all gone, but the threat lives on - and is coming up through the soil. </p> <p>Geologists and mining experts fear that an ogre is stirring in the disused pits of this country. They warn that nowhere near enough is being done to identify where it could strike. Their expertise, they say, should be being used by local authorities to pinpoint areas at risk of gas seeping from old workings. </p> <p>Christopher Noonan would still be alive if a local authority had done just that and put in place safety measures. Last month, Barnsley council admitted two breaches of health and safety regulations by not checking the risk from mine gas when work was planned near the site of a former pit. The authority was fined \u00a320,000 at Sheffield crown court. Yorkshire Water, which contracted out the job to the council, and the council's contractors were each fined \u00a32,500 after both admitted one breach of regulations. </p> <p>Noonan, 22, suffocated as he went to the aid of his father, Stephen, who had collapsed in a trench filled with blackdamp while they were laying sewer pipes near Barnsley in 1998. Blackdamp is a heavy, suffocating mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide which may accumulate in abandoned mine workings. Experts found it had seeped into the trench from a disused colliery nearby. Workmates managed to haul Stephen out of the trench, but by that time Christopher had also collapsed and they were too late to save his life. </p> <p>Barnsley council maintains that \"at the time of the accident, the risks associated with blackdamp were not fully understood in the civil engineering profession\". Since then, it says, it has taken thorough steps to amend procedures and training to ensure such an incident never happens again. </p> <p>But even if Barnsley has tightened up, what about every other coalfield area? In abandoned pits across the country, almost all the pumps which prevented mines flooding have been turned off. As the water level rises, it pushes upwards the gas trapped in labyrinthine old mine workings. It may take years for the gas - firedamp or methane, as well as blackdamp - to reach the surface, possibly travelling many miles through tunnels and rock before it finds an escape route to the surface. If it breaks out in an open field, there is no problem: it disperses harmlessly into the atmosphere. But if it comes up under the foundations of a house or a factory, then there is danger. </p> <p>In the Derbyshire pit village of Arkwright, this is exactly what happened in 1988. Methane, believed to be from the local colliery which had closed earlier that year, was found seeping into houses in the village. After investigations by the local council and British Coal, it was decided that so many homes were at risk from the explosive gas that the entire village should be demolished. Arkwright's school, chapel, pub and club, corner shops and almost 200 terraced houses were razed and a new village built nearby on land pronounced safe. </p> <p>The previous year, a few miles from Arkwright, Don Gent had gone to bed in his detached, two-storey cottage in Sutton Scarsfield. A retired British Coal manager, he was no stranger to methane. In the early hours of the morning, he was woken by an explosion. As he opened his eyes, he saw the gable end of his cottage fall away - blown off, according to the fire service, by a build-up of methane, in the cupboard under the stairs, that had been ignited by the central heating timer switching on. Methane is so sensitive that the tiny spark generated by the electric current of a telephone ringing or a doorbell chiming, can ignite it. Gent escaped with his life, but the ensuing fire destroyed his home. </p> <p>This same gas was discovered in 1980 in houses in Barnsley, where homes on The Smithies council estate were regularly evacuated. Twenty years on, methane is still triggering alarms installed in houses by the local authority. The gas has also been found on an adjacent private housing estate. In nearby Rotherham, methane has been found on Kimberworth Park, a council estate of more than 2,000 homes. There, as in Barnsley, some houses have been permanently boarded up, unsafe for human habitation. </p> <p>In 1995, blackdamp claimed the life of Donald Tollett in the Northumberland village of Widdrington. He had been at his brother's furniture factory, housed in old colliery buildings at the top of a disused drift mine. One of the small, brick sheds on the edge of the site was used as a makeshift stable and Tollett had gone to feed the horse. Minutes after walking into the stable, he and his dog were dead. The gas forms in layers close to the ground. It is thought that the dog was overcome on entering the stable. Tollett probably bent down to see what was wrong and he, too, was suffocated. The horse, standing upright, was unaffected. </p> <p>This fatality, and further incidents in the north-east, prompted a Commons debate during which the then environment minister, Sir Paul Beresford, told MPs that a study had been commissioned in light of the increasing threat posed by mine gas emissions. In 1996, the report was published, warning local authorities and developers of their legal duties and of what needed to be done before planning consents were granted. </p> <p>Since then, however, there has been a deafening silence. As Steve Dumpleton, of the British Geological Survey (BGS), says, few councils have taken advantage of available skills in the mapping of mine gas movements. \"The main task, as I see it, is to develop awareness ahead of the problems occurring,\" he argues. \"The next step would be to map out the most likely areas and locations for gas emissions. Local authorities, property developers, construction engineers and planners should be aware of the potential hazards.\" </p> <p>One of the few authorities to use the expertise of the BGS is Castle Morpeth, in which Widdrington lies. George Reeves, head of the engineering geology department at Newcastle University, has also been involved there. He passionately argues that the public does not know enough about the threat of mine gas. \"There must be more public awareness,\" he says. \"There is an apparent lack of national concern. We need planning maps covering every potential area for mine gas emissions. We need to pinpoint where the gas could strike next.\" </p> <p>The health and safety executive, which brought last month's legal action against Barnsley council, is adamant that local authorities must accept the reality of the mine gas threat. Health and safety inspector Brian Arnold, who worked on the case, says councils in former coalfields have a statutory duty to assess the risk. \"This problem is not going to go away and could very well escalate,\" he warns. \"Councils should realise this and act accordingly. This is a serious health and safety matter.\" </p> <p>With more and more pressure being placed on local authorities to use brownfield sites for development, including housing, such warnings ought to be ringing in the ears of every coalfields council. It is not only new development that is at risk: existing housing estates have been infiltrated by gas. If the experts are right, nowhere near an old mine can beassumed to be safe unless gas is tracked and workings are safely ventilated. </p> <p>Protecting every home, factory, office and shopping centre in every mining area would be a mammoth task. And where would the money come from? Responsibility for mine gas has never been established. British Coal and its successor, the Coal Authority, have assisted when mine gas has caused problems, but they have acted on a \"good neighbour\" basis. They have never admitted responsibility and no local authority has dared take its chance in the courts to prove the issue. </p> <p>When the coal industry went into sharp decline after the 1984-85 strike, one of the few silver linings for mining communities was release from the dreadful occupational hazards faced by generations of colliers. How cruel a legacy that the jobs have gone, but the hazards remain. </p> <p><strong>Real threat of an invisible killer</strong></p> <p>There are, says George Reeves, \"tens of thousands\" of old coal mine openings in Britain. And that's not counting abandoned underground workings in limestone, sandstone, Bath stone, copper, lead, zinc and tin - among others. </p> <p>\"In County Durham alone in the late 1800s, there were 400 large operating mines, ignoring all the smaller ones,\" Reeves says. \"That gives you an idea of the scale of what we're talking about.\" </p> <p>In the north-east, blackdamp is known as \"stythe\". It is a gas, odourless and colourless, produced by the natural reaction of air with coal and timber used as pit props. As well as being forced to the surface by underground flooding, it can escape from mines during severe weather when the barometric pressure drops sharply. </p> <p>Householders in coalfield areas should be alert to difficulty lighting fires or cookers, problems with heating systems, breathing difficulties, dizzy spells or persistent headaches, babies experiencing distress when crawling, and sudden, unexplained deaths of pets. </p> <p><strong> David Brindle</strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>When Paul was taken into care at only six weeks old, he was sent to live with a foster carer with a difference - one who agreed at the outset that if the courts decided his birth mother should give up the little boy, then she would adopt him. </p> <p>The baby was placed with his carer through the Coram Family concurrent planning project, a London-based pilot scheme which sets out to ensure that young babies and children who come into care find a permanent family from the earliest possible date. </p> <p>While Paul (not his real name) is busy getting to know his new carer, his birth mother has been given one last chance to win him back. If she is able to convince the court she had dealt with her problems - including drugs - which put her child at risk, she stands a chance of keeping him. If not, Paul will be adopted. </p> <p>The government wants to see more children in care adopted - an increase of at least 40% by 2004-05. An adoption white paper and draft national standards, published before Christmas, called for local authorities to look harder and quickly for permanent solutions for children. The controversy over internet adoptions has further raised the stakes. </p> <p>A growing number of adoption professionals believe that concurrent planning is the answer for a significant number of younger children in care. Babies in the care system can face delays of up to two years before they are adopted, or returned to live with their birth parents or with a relative. Concurrent planning sets out to minimise the number of moves children make by placing them with foster carers until the courts decide their future. If the birth parent fails to convince the courts they are able to offer their child a safe and loving home, the foster parents already caring for the child will adopt. </p> <p>The approach is in its infancy in this country. The Manchester Adoption Agency was the first organisation to put a toe in the water when it opened the Goodman project - a concurrency team that made its first placement in September 1998 and has placed 11 children to date. Manchester was followed by Brighton &amp; Hove council, which added concurrency planning in August 1999. </p> <p>In the US, the approach has been used for about 15 years with children up to age eight. The London scheme, run by Coram Family, a children's charity, receives referrals from Islington and Camden social services and targets children under the age of two. So far, it has placed two boys (both born drug-dependent) and hopes to place another child shortly. </p> <p>Gill Gray, project leader at Coram, says concurrent planning is driven by \"attachment theory\". Babies who come into care via the traditional route may live in a series of foster homes before they find an adoptive family. \"Children who don't get the opportunity to make close attachments, or who have those attachments disrupted early on, can have difficulties forming relationships in later life or can develop emotional problems,\" she says. </p> <p>Government research shows that the average time spent \"looked after\", before a decision is made on adoption, is 16 months. The average time from decision to placement is another seven months. Everyone agrees that this is too long for an already vulnerable child to spend in limbo. </p> <p>Nina Gardner, manager of the Goodman project, says concurrency focuses the minds of all the adults involved in decision-making. While the legal processes are essentially the same as other care proceedings, decisions are made within a set time scale.

      "bodyText": "When Paul was taken into care at only six weeks old, he was sent to live with a foster carer with a difference - one who agreed at the outset that if the courts decided his birth mother should give up the little boy, then she would adopt him. The baby was placed with his carer through the Coram Family concurrent planning project, a London-based pilot scheme which sets out to ensure that young babies and children who come into care find a permanent family from the earliest possible date. While Paul (not his real name) is busy getting to know his new carer, his birth mother has been given one last chance to win him back. If she is able to convince the court she had dealt with her problems - including drugs - which put her child at risk, she stands a chance of keeping him. If not, Paul will be adopted. The government wants to see more children in care adopted - an increase of at least 40% by 2004-05. An adoption white paper and draft national standards, published before Christmas, called for local authorities to look harder and quickly for permanent solutions for children. The controversy over internet adoptions has further raised the stakes. A growing number of adoption professionals believe that concurrent planning is the answer for a significant number of younger children in care. Babies in the care system can face delays of up to two years before they are adopted, or returned to live with their birth parents or with a relative. Concurrent planning sets out to minimise the number of moves children make by placing them with foster carers until the courts decide their future. If the birth parent fails to convince the courts they are able to offer their child a safe and loving home, the foster parents already caring for the child will adopt. The approach is in its infancy in this country. The Manchester Adoption Agency was the first organisation to put a toe in the water when it opened the Goodman project - a concurrency team that made its first placement in September 1998 and has placed 11 children to date. Manchester was followed by Brighton &amp; Hove council, which added concurrency planning in August 1999. In the US, the approach has been used for about 15 years with children up to age eight. The London scheme, run by Coram Family, a children's charity, receives referrals from Islington and Camden social services and targets children under the age of two. So far, it has placed two boys (both born drug-dependent) and hopes to place another child shortly. Gill Gray, project leader at Coram, says concurrent planning is driven by \"attachment theory\". Babies who come into care via the traditional route may live in a series of foster homes before they find an adoptive family. \"Children who don't get the opportunity to make close attachments, or who have those attachments disrupted early on, can have difficulties forming relationships in later life or can develop emotional problems,\" she says. Government research shows that the average time spent \"looked after\", before a decision is made on adoption, is 16 months. The average time from decision to placement is another seven months. Everyone agrees that this is too long for an already vulnerable child to spend in limbo. Nina Gardner, manager of the Goodman project, says concurrency focuses the minds of all the adults involved in decision-making. While the legal processes are essentially the same as other care proceedings, decisions are made within a set time scale. Concurrency cases are heard by a judge who is familiar with the concept, and final hearing dates to determine the child's future, are usually set at the first full hearing of the case. Gardner says: \"We placed a child on December 4 and we have a final hearing date of July 23.\" While the child is being \"fostered\", staff assess the birth parents or any other member of the child's family interested in caring for the child. The assessment can last for anything from six to nine months and, during that time, the birth parents have regular contact with their child - usually three times a week.

      "body": "<p>Only a fortnight before tickets go on sale for the 2002 World Cup finals the co-hosts Japan and South Korea are entrenched in an embarrassing row over the most basic of basics: what to call the tournament. </p> <p>The two historical rivals are butting heads over which country's name should appear first on official documents, merchandising and promotional materials. </p> <p>This is a serious setback after four years of work aimed at projecting next year's finals - the first to be held in Asia - as a symbol of modern-day harmony between former enemies. </p> <p>\"I think both sides need some time to cool down,\" said Moon Dong Hoo, general secretary of the Korean organising committee (KAWOC) after heated discussions with his Japanese counterparts and Fifa executives in Cannes this week. </p> <p>The row dates back to 1996, when Fifa forced the two countries to share the tournament after the bitterest of bidding competitions. </p> <p>Under a compromise after that decision Fifa awarded the final to Japan (Yokohama, June 30). As a consolation South Korea was given the opening game (Seoul, May 31) and the honour of having its name put first on the official English title: the 2002 Fifa World Cup Korea/Japan. </p> <p>No detailed record has been kept of those negotiations but Japan insists a gentlemen's agreement was reached that would allow it to switch the order of the two countries' names when written in kanji characters (Japanese script) for the domestic market. </p> <p>But after complaints from South Korea this month, Fifa has prohibited Japan from putting its name first in any form on tournament tickets. Fifa's general secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen said: \"We are aware of the sensitivity of the situation in Japan but we have decided it should be the same in any language.\" </p> <p>But a Japanese organising comittee spokesman said: \"We had a mutual understanding that we have been applying for more than three years with no problems,\" said a spokesman for the Japanese organising committee. \"But now the Korean side are making claims against us.\" </p> <p>Japan has retaliated by dropping the names of both countries on the 675,000 tickets going on sale from February 15. The cheapest will be \u00a340 and the most expensive \u00a3480. There are 64 games, split equally between the two countries, although one or two may yet be played in North Korea. </p> <p>Japan is still demanding that South Korea and Fifa recognise the unwritten agreement but KAWOC is digging in. \"We don't think there was such an agreement. There are no documents,\" said a KAWOC spokesman. \"We insist Korea's name should always come first. It was part of the package deal under which we conceded the final match.\" </p> <p>Behind this tough stance is Chung Mong-joon, KAWOC's chairman and a Fifa vice-president. Chung, who is also a member of South Korea's parliament, has acknowledged that he sees the tournament as a springboard for a possible presidential election bid in 2002.

      "bodyText": "Only a fortnight before tickets go on sale for the 2002 World Cup finals the co-hosts Japan and South Korea are entrenched in an embarrassing row over the most basic of basics: what to call the tournament. The two historical rivals are butting heads over which country's name should appear first on official documents, merchandising and promotional materials. This is a serious setback after four years of work aimed at projecting next year's finals - the first to be held in Asia - as a symbol of modern-day harmony between former enemies. \"I think both sides need some time to cool down,\" said Moon Dong Hoo, general secretary of the Korean organising committee (KAWOC) after heated discussions with his Japanese counterparts and Fifa executives in Cannes this week. The row dates back to 1996, when Fifa forced the two countries to share the tournament after the bitterest of bidding competitions. Under a compromise after that decision Fifa awarded the final to Japan (Yokohama, June 30). As a consolation South Korea was given the opening game (Seoul, May 31) and the honour of having its name put first on the official English title: the 2002 Fifa World Cup Korea/Japan. No detailed record has been kept of those negotiations but Japan insists a gentlemen's agreement was reached that would allow it to switch the order of the two countries' names when written in kanji characters (Japanese script) for the domestic market. But after complaints from South Korea this month, Fifa has prohibited Japan from putting its name first in any form on tournament tickets. Fifa's general secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen said: \"We are aware of the sensitivity of the situation in Japan but we have decided it should be the same in any language.\" But a Japanese organising comittee spokesman said: \"We had a mutual understanding that we have been applying for more than three years with no problems,\" said a spokesman for the Japanese organising committee. \"But now the Korean side are making claims against us.\" Japan has retaliated by dropping the names of both countries on the 675,000 tickets going on sale from February 15. The cheapest will be \u00a340 and the most expensive \u00a3480. There are 64 games, split equally between the two countries, although one or two may yet be played in North Korea. Japan is still demanding that South Korea and Fifa recognise the unwritten agreement but KAWOC is digging in. \"We don't think there was such an agreement. There are no documents,\" said a KAWOC spokesman. \"We insist Korea's name should always come first. It was part of the package deal under which we conceded the final match.\" Behind this tough stance is Chung Mong-joon, KAWOC's chairman and a Fifa vice-president. Chung, who is also a member of South Korea's parliament, has acknowledged that he sees the tournament as a springboard for a possible presidential election bid in 2002. A firm attitude towards Japan, which colonised Korea for 35 years until 1945, is likely to go down well with elderly voters. \u0095 Saudi Arabia's captain Sami Al-Jaber has left Wolves after a five-month loan. He was offered an extended spell by the manager Dave Jones but chose to return to the Saudi champions Al-Hilal. \u0095 The former Brazil World Cup defender Junior Baiano has tested positive for cocaine, the Brazilian Football Confederation said yesterday.

      "body": "<p>English football will have two transfer windows, one in the winter and another in the summer, under changes being considered by Fifa and Uefa as part of its review of how the transfer system can be amended to comply with European labour laws. </p> <p>Michel Zen-Ruffinen, Fifa's general secretary, revealed at the Football Expo conference here yesterday that Fifa, Uefa and the European Commission had reached agreement on five crucial changes to the transfer system and that once a new system was in place it would apply to the whole world, not just Europe. </p> <p>Those five areas of agreement are: two transfer windows; no transfer fees for players aged 23 or over who move at the end of their contracts; a prohibition - with certain exceptions - on transfers for players aged under 18 which Fifa claims will stop the exploitation of players from South America and Africa; compensation for all clubs involved in the development of a player transferred before reaching the age of 23; and a new arbitration system to deal with disputes and to set levels of compensation. </p> <p>A joint Fifa/Uefa task force on transfers is due to meet commission officials in Brussels on February 16 to iron out remaining differences, and Zen-Ruffinen warned that it was likely to be a make-or-break meeting. </p> <p>Zen-Ruffinen said: \"Everybody will know on February 16 whether there will be agreement or not. We have already reached a number of agreements with the EC. We want to get this matter resolved as quickly as possible. If all goes to plan then the new regulations will be integrated by mid-March but obviously we will allow for a large transitional period.\" </p> <p>Fifa also revealed that it wanted to reach agreement before two cases which challenge the legality of the transfer system are heard before a Brussels court. </p> <p>One of the cases is being brought by the Hungarian footballer Tibor Balog and involves freedom of movement within Europe for players who come from countries that have special trade links with the European Union. If Balog wins, then it could open the door to many players from outside the EU, giving them the right to play without work permits. </p> <p>Zen-Ruffinen said: \"These cases could have disastrous consequences for football. They could be worse than Bosman. The second case is challenging the legality of the transfer system. We want to settle the whole transfer system issue before these cases are heard.\" </p> <p>If there is no agreement next month, then changes to the transfer system could be imposed by the European Commission, which has demanded that footballers be allowed the same freedom of movement as other workers in Europe. </p> <p>The main area of disagreement continues to be the minimum time players must honour contracts. Fifa and Uefa want players to honour five-year contracts for a minimum three-year period. This, however, is being opposed by Fifpro, the international players' organisation, and representatives of some leagues. </p> <p>Zen-Ruffinen also revealed that representatives of the G14 clubs - the group of Europe's biggest and most influential clubs which includes Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United - have been invited to a meeting next week to discuss the new transfer system. If the various football bodies reach an agreement, the proposals will be submitted to the commission ahead of the February 16 meeting. </p> <p>Zen-Ruffinen added: \"We are working very actively towards producing a final document. We want to get everybody involved - G14, the players and even some of the leagues that have not taken part so far. The players have not yet been consulted but they have been invited to the forthcoming meeting. We are confident that we will be able to reach agreement with everybody.\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Michel Zen-Ruffinen, Fifa's general secretary, revealed at the Football Expo conference here yesterday that Fifa, Uefa and the European Commission had reached agreement on five crucial changes to the transfer system and that once a new system was in place it would apply to the whole world, not just Europe. Those five areas of agreement are: two transfer windows; no transfer fees for players aged 23 or over who move at the end of their contracts; a prohibition - with certain exceptions - on transfers for players aged under 18 which Fifa claims will stop the exploitation of players from South America and Africa; compensation for all clubs involved in the development of a player transferred before reaching the age of 23; and a new arbitration system to deal with disputes and to set levels of compensation. A joint Fifa/Uefa task force on transfers is due to meet commission officials in Brussels on February 16 to iron out remaining differences, and Zen-Ruffinen warned that it was likely to be a make-or-break meeting. Zen-Ruffinen said: \"Everybody will know on February 16 whether there will be agreement or not. We have already reached a number of agreements with the EC. We want to get this matter resolved as quickly as possible. If all goes to plan then the new regulations will be integrated by mid-March but obviously we will allow for a large transitional period.\" Fifa also revealed that it wanted to reach agreement before two cases which challenge the legality of the transfer system are heard before a Brussels court. One of the cases is being brought by the Hungarian footballer Tibor Balog and involves freedom of movement within Europe for players who come from countries that have special trade links with the European Union. If Balog wins, then it could open the door to many players from outside the EU, giving them the right to play without work permits. Zen-Ruffinen said: \"These cases could have disastrous consequences for football. They could be worse than Bosman. The second case is challenging the legality of the transfer system. We want to settle the whole transfer system issue before these cases are heard.\" If there is no agreement next month, then changes to the transfer system could be imposed by the European Commission, which has demanded that footballers be allowed the same freedom of movement as other workers in Europe. The main area of disagreement continues to be the minimum time players must honour contracts. Fifa and Uefa want players to honour five-year contracts for a minimum three-year period. This, however, is being opposed by Fifpro, the international players' organisation, and representatives of some leagues. Zen-Ruffinen also revealed that representatives of the G14 clubs - the group of Europe's biggest and most influential clubs which includes Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United - have been invited to a meeting next week to discuss the new transfer system. If the various football bodies reach an agreement, the proposals will be submitted to the commission ahead of the February 16 meeting. Zen-Ruffinen added: \"We are working very actively towards producing a final document. We want to get everybody involved - G14, the players and even some of the leagues that have not taken part so far. The players have not yet been consulted but they have been invited to the forthcoming meeting. We are confident that we will be able to reach agreement with everybody.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Its detractors view it as a historical monstrosity, tendentious and disastrously tainted by its composer's later allegiance to the Third Reich.

The revival is more strongly cast than before, with the central roles of Palestrina and Cardinal Borromeo - whose confrontations are the real thrust of the work - this time sung by Philip Langridge and John Tomlinson. Having such powerfully committed stage performers at the heart of Nikolaus Lehnhoff's production undoubtedly tightens its focus, though by this director's high standards it is not a particularly memorable show. </p> <p>Langridge maps Palestrina's self-doubt and religious dilemma with painful accuracy, and Tomlinson puts the case for Borromeo's bullying with power and conviction: every word matters. </p> <p>There are yet more distinguished names in the cast - Kurt Rydl as the ruthless Madruscht, Graham Clark as the eccentric Bishop of Budoja, Anthony Rolfe-Johnson as the enfeebled Patriarch of Assyria, and the great Kurt Moll in a cameo appearance as Pope Pius IV. </p> <p>There is a real authority about the performance this time, but it is not enough. Even if one puts aside the whole political dimension of the work - and it's a big \"if\" - Palestrina is still a hopeless piece of music drama, lumbering and unwieldy. The huge, 105-minute first act, which ends with angels dictating Palestrina's new mass to him, is so one-paced that it cannot sustain itself, while the swarm of clerics in the second, which depicts the Council of Trent's debate on church music in the Counter-Reformation, are only sketchily characterised. </p> <p>The music is filled with schoolmasterly cadences and rambling, unfocused melodic lines; everything is over-extended. </p> <p>In the end, the whole ethos of the work is unacceptable. It's not even necessary to invoke Pfitzner's later career, his rabid nationalism or his anti-modernist writings, culminating in the Nazi concept of \"degenerate music\", to find something profoundly pernicious in Palestrina. The depiction of the central character as a god-fearing, conservative composer who triumphs against the forces of new music (by means of a work dictated to him by the angels, for heaven's sake) is such an obvious piece of self-identification on Pfitzner's part that it cannot be ignored. </p> <p>There he was, a deeply conservative composer in the years of the first world war, seeing himself passed over in favour of the new generation of modernists, and what fuels and fatally diminishes his \"masterpiece\" is that bilious sense of injustice. </p> <p>\u0095 In rep until February 8.

Illogical, non-linear and cyclical in its structure, its landscape is darkly subliminal, and deliberately unintelligible. On a two-screen DVD projection in an L-shape along adjoining walls, it brings to life the kind of nightmares you have only after really strong cheese, the queasy dreams you can never quite recall in the morning. </p> <p>Here are lipstick-sporting dandies in judges' wigs; a woman with bunches holding up soiled knickers; a gap-toothed man brandishing a clock. People sit with sticky tape across their faces: it looks a bit like disfigurement, but a lot more like strips of sticky tape. They writhe around as if in a rudimentary dance class doing stormy seas or the wind whooshing through trees. </p> <p>A blue section - in lighting and subject - has orifices pounded, a studded tongue and a very erect penis. To really put you off your tuna ciabatta, this is intercut with images of a man in big, scary Y-fronts having sex with what looks like a woman's body made of excrement. He smears himself and pokes his fingers in holes full of what looks like blood. And so it goes on, oddly dull despite the flicking from weirdness to weirdness, the X-rated scenarios and horror. </p> <p>There's a serious problem, too, with the installation here. Designed to be flexible, to work in different spaces (a bar; an external light show against a building; an internet broadcast), in the gallery it is impossible to see both screens at once. A column in the middle restricts the view of one screen, maddeningly cutting right through it wherever you view from. </p> <p>Ultimately, though, it's the self-conscious unintelligibility of The Wake that sends you to sleep. When Joyce wrote his epic, almost unreadable book, he was smashing convention, breaking the legacy of the 19th-century novel. It's not clear what this film challenges. Hollywood and the predictability of mainstream film? We've been there, done that - without the mucky Y-fronts and the dreary self-indulgence. </p> <p>\u0095 Until February 10.

People sit with sticky tape across their faces: it looks a bit like disfigurement, but a lot more like strips of sticky tape. They writhe around as if in a rudimentary dance class doing stormy seas or the wind whooshing through trees. A blue section - in lighting and subject - has orifices pounded, a studded tongue and a very erect penis. To really put you off your tuna ciabatta, this is intercut with images of a man in big, scary Y-fronts having sex with what looks like a woman's body made of excrement. He smears himself and pokes his fingers in holes full of what looks like blood. And so it goes on, oddly dull despite the flicking from weirdness to weirdness, the X-rated scenarios and horror. There's a serious problem, too, with the installation here. Designed to be flexible, to work in different spaces (a bar; an external light show against a building; an internet broadcast), in the gallery it is impossible to see both screens at once. A column in the middle restricts the view of one screen, maddeningly cutting right through it wherever you view from. Ultimately, though, it's the self-conscious unintelligibility of The Wake that sends you to sleep. When Joyce wrote his epic, almost unreadable book, he was smashing convention, breaking the legacy of the 19th-century novel. It's not clear what this film challenges. Hollywood and the predictability of mainstream film? We've been there, done that - without the mucky Y-fronts and the dreary self-indulgence. \u0095 Until February 10. Details: 0131-225 2383.",
