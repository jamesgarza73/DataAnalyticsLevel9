Coire Gabhail (pronounced \"Corry Gale\") is also known as the Lost Valley of Glencoe.

At a height of about 1,200ft (365m), the flat, green meadow floor is enclosed by the precipitous walls of Gear Aonach and Beinn Fhada, which sweep round to the great buttresses at the head of the valley and the pass of Bealach Dearg, which leads up to the unseen summit of Bidean nam Bian to the right. </p> <p>Walk up the valley as far as you wish, perhaps to the last rowan where the infant Allt Coire Gabhail sinks beneath the rocks, and then make your way back the way you came, carefully as before, down that steep, rocky staircase, over that controversial footbridge, and back to the car park. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>The A82 bisects Glencoe, which is 17 miles south of Fort William.

      "bodyText": "Aides to Republican George W Bush have hailed a count of overseas absentee ballots that expanded his lead in Florida today to over 926 votes ahead of Democrat Al Gore. But they complained that continuing hand recounts in three Democratic-leaning counties are \"flawed and subject to human error.\" \"Florida's votes have now been counted and recounted, and in some counties recounted three or four times ...\" Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said in a written statement. \"We are hopeful that once the Florida Supreme Court has heard arguments in this case, the laws of Florida will prevail and the election will be certified.\" On CNN, Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway defended the hand recounts. \"Given the scrutiny that has been brought to bear, everyone ought to be comfortable with the outcome,\" he said. All eyes were on the state's Supreme Court, which has prohibited the Florida secretary of state from certifying final results without the court's permission. The justices have set oral arguments for Monday. Hand recounts resumed today in Palm Beach and Broward counties. In Miami-Dade County, Republicans objected to a plan by the canvassing board to put each of the area's 654,000 punch-card ballots through a machine tomorrow before starting a hand recount on Monday.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>We are wobbling across the Serengeti in a tiny 10-seater aircraft when we first work out that something strange is going on. As vast, ochre-coloured plains strewn with wildebeest and gazelle open out beneath us, our pilot abandons the controls, rummages in his bag, pulls out a pocket camera and starts taking photographs through the window. We glance nervously at each other and at the 10,000ft discrepancy between ourselves and the ground. The pilot clicks contentedly away. </p> <p>But perhaps we shouldn't have been surprised. Tanzania keeps doing this to you - thrusting so much natural beauty, such a diversity of wildlife, that it's all you can do to gawp and fumble for your camera. </p> <p>This is a country famous for its obsession with conservation: since independence in 1961, a quarter of its land has been given over to burgeoning populations of lion, giraffe, gazelle, rhino, wildebeest and zebra, prompting controversial policies barring Maasai from cattle-grazing land that are only now being reconsidered. But tourists have only been cautiously welcomed too, so the horror stories of Kenya's Maasai Mara - Land Rovers as numerous as tsetse fly - are unheard of here. In Tanzania's northern circuit of game reserves, the trick is simple: build fewer safari lodges and charge visitors more. It works. </p> <p><strong> Lake Manyara</strong><br> </p> <p>The flamingo-fringed shoreline of this vast saltwater lake is safari for beginners. The water and surrounding flats, lapping serenely at the western wall of the Great Rift valley, are home to hundreds of bird species and a few nonchalant hippo; no big game here, we are assured. </p> <p>It's on that basis alone that we agree to leave the safety of our open-topped safari cruiser and take to mountain bikes under the tutelage of Jean du Plessis, a rugged adventure-holiday specialist and the type of man whom, one imagines, would be desperately unhappy in any profession not involving the imminent risk of attack by large and intemperate animals. </p> <p>Talk about getting close to nature: Manyara's smaller birds glide within inches of your face; its purple soil gets lodged beneath your fingernails. It's not evident at first why the locals laugh so knowingly at us as we clatter through the village of Mto Wa Mbu en route to the lakeshore - but all becomes clear when we read, later, about the tree-climbing lions for which the area is famed, and about which Jean has thankfully omitted to inform us. </p> <p>We collapse in a sweaty heap at Lake Manyara Serena Lodge, first of the four Serena properties where we'll spend the week. Like the others, it is a collection of what looks like cone-roofed Maasai huts on the outside, but suspiciously like luxury hotel bedrooms on the inside; this one is almost invisibly blended into the acacia-studded escarpment overlooking the lake. Breakfast and dinner take the form of simple buffets; game is strictly off the menu. </p> <p>If only to shake off the animal-focused tunnel vision that grows on the visitor so quickly here, a tour of Mto Wa Mbu is a must. Despite its unpromising name - Mto Wa Mbu translates as \"mosquito river\"- the village is a nationally famous model of integration: the proud local boast is that 130 tribes live in harmony here. </p> <p>Wesley Hans Kileo's Cultural Tour channels profits from the three-hour walk into village schooling projects. As a result, we are warmly welcomed inside villagers' mud-walled homes, corralled into complicated games by their children and invited to taste the acrid local banana beer - although, in retrospect, this may have been some cruel practical joke. </p> <p>Mountain bike safaris cost $55 per person for a three-hour trek with Footprint Adventures, <a href=\"mailto:footprintadv@hotmail.com\">footprintadv@hotmail.com</a> or satellite phone 0027117742380. Village walk, $45pp, organised through Footprint Adventures. </p> <p><strong> Ngorongoro crater</strong><br> </p> <p>For anyone - like me - whose prior experience of wildlife-spotting consists of watching baboons defecate on your windscreen on a drizzly Sunday at the West Midlands Safari Park, a first glimpse of the Ngorongoro crater poses a serious risk of cardiac arrest. </p> <p>The steep road from Manyara climbs into forests shrouded in cloud, past the watchful gaze of Maasai herdsmen in their vivid red capes, before reaching the 3,000m-high rim of the crater and - when the cloud eventually lifts - what has to be one of the world's great views. Its forests, swamps and lakes - a patchwork of greens and browns - are home to a concentrated profusion of Tanzania's finest: lion, elephant, rhino, wildebeest, zebra, buffalo, hyena, golden jackal, ostrich and crowned cranes. </p> <p>\"Those things can accelerate from zero to 50mph in, like, seconds,\" claims our guide, Hezron, referring to an elephant munching from branches nearby. It is not abundantly clear that the same could be said of our safari vehicle. Less alarming but just as memorable are the plentiful warthog, comically misformed creatures who trot affectingly past in little family groupings. </p> <p>Descent into the crater is restricted to 4x4s accompanied by a national parks ranger, and giant gates across the access roads clang shut at 6pm sharp. Stay as late as possible, though: when the sun sinks towards the horizon, the light through the baobab trees takes on an ethereal quality, and the chances are maximised of seeing the crater's prized sight: a black rhino and its calf, making for the woods for the night. </p> <p><strong> Olduvai gorge</strong><br> </p> <p>Amid all this furious fertility it comes as little surprise to discover that some of the earliest evidence of human life was found mere kilometres away at Olduvai gorge, a 90m-deep canyon just northwest of the crater. Here, in 1959, husband- and-wife archaeologists Louis and Mary Leakey found the skull of an upright hominid thought to be 1.8 million years old.</p> <p>Today, for a nominal fee, visitors who manage to endure a lecture from resident archaeologist Ozias Sam Kileo can browse an informative if traditional museum on the site, complete with a series of lovingly framed prints recording a recent visit by Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. </p> <p>\u0095 Olduvai gorge visitors centre, PO Box 7, Arusha, Tanzania (booking not required). </p> <p><strong> Serengeti</strong><br> </p> <p>The pile-'em-high wildlife sights of Ngorongoro suddenly seem rather artificial and Disneyfied, though, when we arrive at our final destination: the sweeping, endless, rock-strewn plains of the Serengeti. </p> <p>There is hardly a shortage of game, or visitors - more than 100,000 people visit every year - but their dispersal over the national park's 14,763 square kilometres accords each new sighting the palpable thrill of a genuine discovery: a cheetah, scanning the horizon for potential prey in the throbbing midday sun; a pride of lions tossing and turning in fitful sleep beneath a baobab tree; 11 huge crocodiles half-submerged in a stagnant gorge, jaws open for ventilation and in readiness for the next unlucky wildebeest to stray from its path and slip into the muddy water. </p> <p>The exception to this less-is-more rule is to be found in the park's Western Corridor between May and July, during the migration of wildebeest, plains zebra and antelope from northern Tanzania to the neighbouring Maasai Mara. </p> <p>And what an exception: on our second day in the park, rising early when the wildlife is most active, we drive for hours through countless thousands of lowing wildebeest, as far as the eye could see, scattering in front of us as we cut a swathe through their numbers. You know you have seen something pretty indescribable when the only comparisons that spring to mind are with nature documentaries on the Discovery Channel. </p> <p>Hunting in the parks is strictly outlawed - the sound of gunshots is more likely to come from rangers shooting poachers with their automatic rifles - but there are plenty of grimmer sights for the seeker of gore. Witnessing a kill requires a lot of game drives and even more luck, but their bloody aftermath is everywhere. </p> <p>We find a zebra, its carcass ripped open by some vanished predator, in the process of having its eyes sucked out and its ribs picked clean by a flock of hungry, croaking vultures. Members of our party voice loud disgust at the spectacle even as they eagerly reload their cameras. </p> <p>A bush dinner is one of the more surreal ways to conclude a sojourn in the Serengeti - and one of the more alarming. For \u00a335 a head, we're driven several miles from our lodge to a grassy clearing, where we find a crackling log fire, a table set in readiness, with bottles of Tusker beer and South African wine, and a chef preparing our food on a portable grill. </p> <p>As the smell of succulent barbecued meat drifts across the lion-infested plains, it becomes rather easy to imagine that we will be constituting, rather than consuming, the dinner in question. Thankfully, though, we are joined by a warden with an AK47 slung over his shoulder who spends the evening patrolling the clearing's perimeter and, somewhat unnervingly, accompanying us on our trips to the isolated toilet tent in the trees. </p> <p>We depart next morning from a tiny rutted airstrip, where, we are told, flights are often delayed for hours because of herds of wildebeest on the runway. Today, there's just a solitary warthog to be chivvied from the Tarmac: we're not going to get stranded here.

      "bodyText": "We are wobbling across the Serengeti in a tiny 10-seater aircraft when we first work out that something strange is going on. As vast, ochre-coloured plains strewn with wildebeest and gazelle open out beneath us, our pilot abandons the controls, rummages in his bag, pulls out a pocket camera and starts taking photographs through the window. We glance nervously at each other and at the 10,000ft discrepancy between ourselves and the ground. The pilot clicks contentedly away. But perhaps we shouldn't have been surprised. Tanzania keeps doing this to you - thrusting so much natural beauty, such a diversity of wildlife, that it's all you can do to gawp and fumble for your camera. This is a country famous for its obsession with conservation: since independence in 1961, a quarter of its land has been given over to burgeoning populations of lion, giraffe, gazelle, rhino, wildebeest and zebra, prompting controversial policies barring Maasai from cattle-grazing land that are only now being reconsidered. But tourists have only been cautiously welcomed too, so the horror stories of Kenya's Maasai Mara - Land Rovers as numerous as tsetse fly - are unheard of here. In Tanzania's northern circuit of game reserves, the trick is simple: build fewer safari lodges and charge visitors more. It works. Lake Manyara The flamingo-fringed shoreline of this vast saltwater lake is safari for beginners. The water and surrounding flats, lapping serenely at the western wall of the Great Rift valley, are home to hundreds of bird species and a few nonchalant hippo; no big game here, we are assured. It's on that basis alone that we agree to leave the safety of our open-topped safari cruiser and take to mountain bikes under the tutelage of Jean du Plessis, a rugged adventure-holiday specialist and the type of man whom, one imagines, would be desperately unhappy in any profession not involving the imminent risk of attack by large and intemperate animals. Talk about getting close to nature: Manyara's smaller birds glide within inches of your face; its purple soil gets lodged beneath your fingernails. It's not evident at first why the locals laugh so knowingly at us as we clatter through the village of Mto Wa Mbu en route to the lakeshore - but all becomes clear when we read, later, about the tree-climbing lions for which the area is famed, and about which Jean has thankfully omitted to inform us. We collapse in a sweaty heap at Lake Manyara Serena Lodge, first of the four Serena properties where we'll spend the week. Like the others, it is a collection of what looks like cone-roofed Maasai huts on the outside, but suspiciously like luxury hotel bedrooms on the inside; this one is almost invisibly blended into the acacia-studded escarpment overlooking the lake. Breakfast and dinner take the form of simple buffets; game is strictly off the menu. If only to shake off the animal-focused tunnel vision that grows on the visitor so quickly here, a tour of Mto Wa Mbu is a must. Despite its unpromising name - Mto Wa Mbu translates as \"mosquito river\"- the village is a nationally famous model of integration: the proud local boast is that 130 tribes live in harmony here. Wesley Hans Kileo's Cultural Tour channels profits from the three-hour walk into village schooling projects. As a result, we are warmly welcomed inside villagers' mud-walled homes, corralled into complicated games by their children and invited to taste the acrid local banana beer - although, in retrospect, this may have been some cruel practical joke. Mountain bike safaris cost $55 per person for a three-hour trek with Footprint Adventures, footprintadv@hotmail.com or satellite phone 0027117742380. Village walk, $45pp, organised through Footprint Adventures. Ngorongoro crater For anyone - like me - whose prior experience of wildlife-spotting consists of watching baboons defecate on your windscreen on a drizzly Sunday at the West Midlands Safari Park, a first glimpse of the Ngorongoro crater poses a serious risk of cardiac arrest. The steep road from Manyara climbs into forests shrouded in cloud, past the watchful gaze of Maasai herdsmen in their vivid red capes, before reaching the 3,000m-high rim of the crater and - when the cloud eventually lifts - what has to be one of the world's great views. Its forests, swamps and lakes - a patchwork of greens and browns - are home to a concentrated profusion of Tanzania's finest: lion, elephant, rhino, wildebeest, zebra, buffalo, hyena, golden jackal, ostrich and crowned cranes. \"Those things can accelerate from zero to 50mph in, like, seconds,\" claims our guide, Hezron, referring to an elephant munching from branches nearby. It is not abundantly clear that the same could be said of our safari vehicle. Less alarming but just as memorable are the plentiful warthog, comically misformed creatures who trot affectingly past in little family groupings. Descent into the crater is restricted to 4x4s accompanied by a national parks ranger, and giant gates across the access roads clang shut at 6pm sharp. Stay as late as possible, though: when the sun sinks towards the horizon, the light through the baobab trees takes on an ethereal quality, and the chances are maximised of seeing the crater's prized sight: a black rhino and its calf, making for the woods for the night. Olduvai gorge Amid all this furious fertility it comes as little surprise to discover that some of the earliest evidence of human life was found mere kilometres away at Olduvai gorge, a 90m-deep canyon just northwest of the crater. Here, in 1959, husband- and-wife archaeologists Louis and Mary Leakey found the skull of an upright hominid thought to be 1.8 million years old. Today, for a nominal fee, visitors who manage to endure a lecture from resident archaeologist Ozias Sam Kileo can browse an informative if traditional museum on the site, complete with a series of lovingly framed prints recording a recent visit by Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. \u0095 Olduvai gorge visitors centre, PO Box 7, Arusha, Tanzania (booking not required). Serengeti The pile-'em-high wildlife sights of Ngorongoro suddenly seem rather artificial and Disneyfied, though, when we arrive at our final destination: the sweeping, endless, rock-strewn plains of the Serengeti. There is hardly a shortage of game, or visitors - more than 100,000 people visit every year - but their dispersal over the national park's 14,763 square kilometres accords each new sighting the palpable thrill of a genuine discovery: a cheetah, scanning the horizon for potential prey in the throbbing midday sun; a pride of lions tossing and turning in fitful sleep beneath a baobab tree; 11 huge crocodiles half-submerged in a stagnant gorge, jaws open for ventilation and in readiness for the next unlucky wildebeest to stray from its path and slip into the muddy water. The exception to this less-is-more rule is to be found in the park's Western Corridor between May and July, during the migration of wildebeest, plains zebra and antelope from northern Tanzania to the neighbouring Maasai Mara. And what an exception: on our second day in the park, rising early when the wildlife is most active, we drive for hours through countless thousands of lowing wildebeest, as far as the eye could see, scattering in front of us as we cut a swathe through their numbers. You know you have seen something pretty indescribable when the only comparisons that spring to mind are with nature documentaries on the Discovery Channel. Hunting in the parks is strictly outlawed - the sound of gunshots is more likely to come from rangers shooting poachers with their automatic rifles - but there are plenty of grimmer sights for the seeker of gore. Witnessing a kill requires a lot of game drives and even more luck, but their bloody aftermath is everywhere. We find a zebra, its carcass ripped open by some vanished predator, in the process of having its eyes sucked out and its ribs picked clean by a flock of hungry, croaking vultures. Members of our party voice loud disgust at the spectacle even as they eagerly reload their cameras. A bush dinner is one of the more surreal ways to conclude a sojourn in the Serengeti - and one of the more alarming. For \u00a335 a head, we're driven several miles from our lodge to a grassy clearing, where we find a crackling log fire, a table set in readiness, with bottles of Tusker beer and South African wine, and a chef preparing our food on a portable grill. As the smell of succulent barbecued meat drifts across the lion-infested plains, it becomes rather easy to imagine that we will be constituting, rather than consuming, the dinner in question. Thankfully, though, we are joined by a warden with an AK47 slung over his shoulder who spends the evening patrolling the clearing's perimeter and, somewhat unnervingly, accompanying us on our trips to the isolated toilet tent in the trees. We depart next morning from a tiny rutted airstrip, where, we are told, flights are often delayed for hours because of herds of wildebeest on the runway. Today, there's just a solitary warthog to be chivvied from the Tarmac: we're not going to get stranded here. Taking a last look at the endless, enveloping plains and the scattering of gazelle sprinting along the horizon, though, that suddenly seems a curiously tempting prospect. Safari for beginners ... the essentials What to take \u0095 Clothing: should be lightweight but not white or gaudy - drawing attention to yourself isn't the best plan for approaching nervy animals at close range. Long sleeves and trousers are better than shorts and T-shirts for staving off mosquitoes; at higher altitudes warm clothing is vital. \u0095 Binoculars: You'll be lost without a pair - preferably a lightweight, compact pair. A camera is a necessity, too, though the sights are so stunning that even a cheap holiday-snap model will produce breathtaking pictures. \u0095 Insect repellent: Except for children, repellent containing a small proportion of the chemical Deet is still recommended, though citronella oil (available cheaply from pharmacists) is a good supplement. A course of malaria treatment is essential - see your doctor around a month before departure if possible. \u0095 Yellow fever certificate: Required by all visitors; your GP will either arrange for a jab or give you a certificate to show you're exempt. \u0095 Mosquito net: provided by most lodges but worth taking, especially if you're travelling on a budget and staying in cheaper accommodation. \u0095 Inflatable cushion: Tanzania's roads have to be experienced to be believed; it's worth taking something to cushion the blows. When to go Peak season is from June to October, after the long rains, before the short rains and while the temperature is relatively cool. December to March is hotter; April and May, the rainy season, is the cheapest but many roads may be inaccessible. You can save by going in late May or early June, when the rains have stopped and the migration is in progress, but low-season prices still apply at many lodges.

Tony Clarke, 37, the Labour MP for Northampton South, said during an internet website interview that the fact his rival in a marginal seat was a Ugandan-born Hindu meant \"we have, for all the wrong reasons, got exactly the right candidate against us we'd want\". Last night the prime minister's deputy spokesman said: \"We would have very strong views on anyone, particularly an MP, who suggested that they would exploit racism,\" though he admitted not seeing the article. In the interview with the political website, YouGov.com, Mr Clarke a pro-Republican Labour rebel, said his opponent Shailesh Vara, a rising star of the Tory party, was at a disadvantage as a London lawyer in a seat where voters wanted someone local. But, in an admission of the strength of the race card, he said the fact Mr Vara was a Ugandan Hindu in a town with Bangladeshi, Pakistani and other Muslim communities meant he was \"unable to rely on the Asian vote\". He continued: \"Just to rub salt into the wounds, although the seat is 80% urban, the 20% rural [vote] have shown themselves in the past to be quite racist in their voting.\" Ironically, Mr Vara, 40, is the only Tory ethnic minority candidate fighting a winnable seat. Mr Clarke seized Northampton South from the Tories in 1997 with a majority of only 744 - it needs a swing of just 1.3% to fall to the Tories and it is Labour's ninth most marginal seat where rightwing Euro-sceptics fringe candidates took 2,500 votes last time. The leftwinger's comments were swiftly seized upon by the Tories who called upon the prime minister to condemn his behaviour. The party's chairman, Michael Ancram said: \"Mr Clarke must retract his comments immediately and apologise to Shailesh Vara and to the people of Northampton South, who will be deeply offended by what he has said.\" Mr Vara, a Ugandan-born solicitor whose parents come from India, said racism was not an issue in the constituency. \"Mr Clarke is crudely trying to inculcate in the campaign something that does not exist.

      "byline": "Ed Butler",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On a frosty October morning in 1997, a small-time criminal named William Youngworth III spoke to reporters outside a Boston gallery. In tones suggesting fatigue and frustration, he warned them that time was running out to resolve one of the most serious art crimes of the century: \"They have an opportunity to recover this stuff, a serious opportunity. You know this isn't a joke. The door is closing.\" </p> <p>The \"stuff\" to which he referred was the world's most prized haul of stolen artworks - artworks described as priceless and irreplaceable by their one-time proud owners, the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum in Boston. But the deal Youngworth was offering was never reached. And within weeks he found himself beginning a three-year jail term. His role in the fraught negotiations to retrieve the Gardner's collection went to the heart of the moral dilemmas facing law enforcers pursuing high-value stolen art; it also offered a telling insight into the modus operandi of a criminal go-between </p> <p>The armed raid that took place just after midnight on Sunday, March 18, 1990, was dazzlingly simple. Two men dressed as police officers approached a side door of the Boston museum. There had been a nearby disturbance, they told the guard inside, and they needed to ensure that everything was all right inside the building. Ignoring official guidelines, the guard agreed to open the door, and within minutes he and another colleague found themselves bound and gagged on the floor. </p> <p>The primitive security system did not include alarms on the individual artworks, so the thieves could work at their leisure, in an 80-minute spree relieving the museum of 13 pieces in total: 11 paintings and sketches, including works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Manet and Degas; a 3,000-year-old Chinese beaker; and the bronzed top of a Napoleonic flagstaff. Strangely, they failed to take the museum's most prized work, Titian's Rape Of Europa, which was left untouched, even though it has been described by experts as arguably the greatest painting in America. Nonetheless, the loss was devastating enough. Estimates vary, but they all easily outstrip the valuations of any other theft since the second world war. Most experts price the value of the stolen works at well over $300 million (around \u00a3210 million). </p> <p>For the fine arts community, it was a seismic blow. The head office of the Art Loss Register in London catalogues two of the stolen canvases - Rembrandt's Storm On The Sea Of Galilee and Vermeer's The Concert, one of only 35 by the painter in existence - as the most prized individual artworks currently missing anywhere in the world. And staff at the Gardner museum still lament the theft in emotive terms. \"It's been like a death in the family,\" said Anne Hawley, who had been the museum's director for just five months when the crime occurred. \"I've never really recovered from the loss or stopped mourning. This has been a real tragedy, not just for Boston, but for the world. Art exists for the beholder, and to believe that it would be forever lost, hidden in a warehouse someplace, never again to be appreciated, is unspeakably sad.\" </p> <p>The crime scene itself produced very little evidence for the police to go on. The two male thieves had been masked and gloved, and said little, according to the guards, except for this tantalising parting shot: \"You'll be hearing from us.\" That promise prompted speculation that the crooks believed that the paintings were insured (they were not), and were banking on a ransom deal. Such deals, though prohibited under most legal systems, are not unheard of in the art world, with thieves usually offering the paintings' return for a small fraction of their market value. \"I know of plenty of cases of such deals happening,\" says one of Britain's leading art loss-adjusters, Charles Hill. \"I think it's outrageous, but it happens.\" </p> <p> However, in the decade since the theft, neither the authorities nor the museum say they have received any formal ransom demand. More than 2,000 leads have been pursued, taking investigators as far afield as Japan, Latin America and Europe. One suspicion tied the theft to the IRA, which has strong links within Boston's large Irish community, not least because, at around the time of the Gardner heist, IRA operatives were known to be dabbling in the laundering of stolen art as a means of raising funds. </p> <p>For all the theories, the missing works of art did not resurface. Paintings of such value could scarcely be traded publicly anywhere in the world without the alarm being raised, according to Tom Cassano, the FBI officer who has been in charge of the investigation throughout. He expresses bemusement: \"It's the biggest whodunnit I've ever worked on, as well as the most frustrating. We haven't got a clue as to who is responsible.\" </p> <p>Some would say that such statements should not be taken entirely at face value, given the FBI's role in the later events of 1997. The situation developed quietly enough. William Youngworth, a small-time antiques dealer from the Boston area with a not-inconsiderable criminal record, found himself the subject of increasing police attention. He cut an unlikely figure as a supposed criminal mastermind: a shambling, overweight man in his late 30s, Youngworth lived unpretentiously in a Boston suburb, his lifestyle providing nothing to indicate a man who had profited from the art heist of the century - in fact, he had been in jail when the robbery took place. </p> <p>Even so, police informants were still naming him as a possible link. \"They raided my house,\" says Youngworth. \"They turned everything over.\" In a large garage packed full of antiques, the police failed to find anything incriminating, except the butt of a marijuana joint, three antique firearms and a stolen van, on which basis they immediately charged him. It was, according to Youngworth, the first of numerous attempts to pursuade him to co-operate. </p> <p>At first, he denied he could be of any help. \"I tried to push this away from me,\" he said. \"I tried to explain that I really didn't know anything.\" In return for the police dropping the charges against him, he says, he engineered the return of a royal seal dating back to the 17th century, one that had been stolen some years earlier. But this tactic backfired, seeming only to whet the FBI's appetite. State attorney Marty Leppo said that the authorities were now convinced they had a lead: \"When he returned the seal, somebody said, 'What else can you do? How about the Gardner?' And then, all of a sudden, Youngworth is in the newspaper.\" </p> <p>Police sources were rumoured to have been behind the leak to the Boston press of his suspected link to the Gardner collection. Tom Mashberg of the Boston Herald was one of the first to sniff a story. Indeed, he takes much of the credit for persuading Youngworth to go public at this stage. \"What we did, in the grand tradition of tabloid newspapers, is that we smoked him out,\" says Mashberg. \"We put some heat on him. And it took about three articles with his name in it before he said, 'Maybe you want to talk to me before you write your next story.'\" Youngworth concedes that the Herald's approach worked. \"Basically, Mashberg extorted me,\" he says. \"He said the pressure in the newspapers was going to become much worse if I didn't agree to help him with his story.\" The heavy pressure may have forced Youngworth's hand, but involving the media may also have been a tactic that the authorities later came to regret. Youngworth would deal, but only on his terms. </p> <p>The Gardner museum had already raised a reward, by way of private donors, for the return of the collection. This at first totalled $1 million. But in 1997, it went up to $5 million, by far the largest reward ever known in connection with an art theft. Rewards are not, of course, unusual in themselves - insurers regard cash incentives as by far the most effective way to uncover art crooks, although, publicly at least, there are strict rules governing their payment. Above all, for obvious reasons, the money should not go to anyone implicated in the theft itself, and typically the reward should lead to at least one prosecution. On the other hand, it's common knowledge that those who receive such rewards are unlikely to be paragons of virtue. Added to which, it is not always easy to sift out who finally ends up with the money once it has been paid. Mashberg puts it succinctly: \"When you put $5 million on the table, you hope that it's Mother Teresa who returns the artwork. More than likely, it'll be somebody in the criminal underworld.\" </p> <p>For Youngworth, the $5 million was only his first demand. He also asked federal negotiators for immunity from prosecution. Believing that they'd tricked him over the return of the seal, he also asked for cast-iron legal guarantees. He says it was only when he started talking about putting things in writing that they started to prevaricate. \"All of a sudden, they wanted me to turn the stuff in first, and then they would discuss a reward afterwards. I said no way. I wasn't going to fall on my sword for them.\" </p> <p>The state prosecutor, Donald Stern, denies that any verbal offers were made. But he does concede opening talks with Youngworth, who by this stage had decided to use the media to his advantage. He appeared on local television saying that he had definite access to the art haul. But now he was upping his demands. He wanted not just the money and immunity, but also the release of his long-term friend and associate, Myles Connor. Connor, at that time serving an 11-year jail term for armed robbery in Pennsylvania, was already a byword for art crime in New England - according to one Boston investigator, when any art went missing in Boston, the first question was always: \"Where was Myles?\" </p> <p>With Connor's sudden entry into the whole equation, law enforcers may well have felt a cold shudder down their collective spines. For one thing, he far more clearly matched the profile of the Mr Big they had been seeking than Youngworth. A sometime lead singer in a club rock'n'roll band, Myles And The Wild Ones, Connor displays all the qualities of a flamboyant, even arrogant, criminal operator. He admits to more than 30 art thefts in a 20-year career dating back to the 60s, and recently boasted that the museum security hadn't yet been invented that could keep him out. </p> <p>For much of his criminal life, he appears to have succeeded where most have failed - he makes art theft pay. Usually, it is impossible to yield more than a tiny fraction of the market value of well-known artwork once it is stolen; at best, it becomes collateral for drugs or other stolen goods, circulating among criminals until someone can find a low-risk way of recycling it on to the legitimate market several years later. But in Connor's hands, stolen art seems to have become a major bargaining chip, either to extort secret ransoms from insurers or to secure immunity from prosecution. Most famously, in 1975, he apparently negotiated the drastic reduction of one art theft charge against him by returning the proceeds of another, a Rembrandt, which at the time was the most precious artwork ever to have been stolen in the US.</p> <p>Extraordinarily, Connor now admits to having stolen the Dutch master himself from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts while on bail for the other thefts. \"He's beaten the system before and he's got away with it,\" says private investigator Charlie Moore. \"I don't know anyone who's been as successful as he has.\" </p> <p>Like Youngworth, Connor was in jail at the time of the Gardner heist and was therefore not a direct suspect, but few could now dismiss the suspicion that he had masterminded the operation from behind bars, and was attempting one of his trademark scams to extort police concessions. Connor was summoned to participate in the now less-than-secret talks between Youngworth and the federal prosecutor's office. But the Boston authorities wanted evidence that these con men were for real. The evidence arrived in dramatic style. </p> <p> Mashberg had been Youngworth's main contact with the media from the start. Now Mashberg found himself talking to mysterious figures who were offering to take him for a drive downtown for the scoop of a lifetime. \"I was out on a limb on this,\" he says. \"It was late, it was dark. Nobody knew. Not even my editor.\" One night in mid-August 1997, at around 2am, he was taken by some decidedly nervous and furtive-looking figures to a disused warehouse in central Boston. He describes a woman with dreadlocks coming to the car. \"Billy sent us,\" the driver told her. Mashberg says she and other men took him up some stairs to a storage locker, where they pulled out a rolled-up canvas. By torchlight he saw what he believes was Rembrandt's Storm On The Sea Of Galilee. </p> <p>Mashberg was pledged to remain silent for a week until his underworld contacts could clear the site. Then, on August 27, he splashed the story across the Herald's front page. \"We've seen it!\" proclaimed the headline. Based on his description of a number of usually hidden features on the rear of the canvas, Mashberg says the Gardner museum confirmed that what he'd seen must have been either the original or a remarkably good forgery. </p> <p>The Herald's revelations put the spotlight firmly on the prosecuting attorney, in this case Stern. Hounded by reporters, Stern announced curtly that \"no good purpose was being served by competing press conferences and competing press statements\". His response to the sighting of Rembrandt's Storm was to declare that Mashberg was not an expert, and therefore more conclusive proof had to be found. But now Youngworth was being taken seriously, at least by the museum, a trustee of which advanced him $10,000 to escape the media pressures of Boston and move to New York. It was from New York that the next piece of evidence arrived in the mail. </p> <p>An envelope, containing photographs and tiny samples, allegedly scratched from the surface of one of the paintings, landed on Mashberg's desk. The Herald sent for one of the highest authorities in the land, Professor Walter McCrone, who had been instrumental in the forensic analysis of the Turin Shroud and had advised on the restoration of the Sistine Chapel. He quickly concluded that the paint chips bore all the hallmarks of vintage Rembrandt. </p> <p>\"They were perfect,\" said McCrone. \"They looked exactly like the pigments and paint layers of 17th-century Holland.\" Unfortunately for McCrone, he had missed something - the absence of one layer of varnish used by Rembrandt in his work of that period. The museum contradicted the professor's findings, a point eagerly pounced on by the federal authorities. \"Despite giving them every opportunity,\" says the FBI's Cassano, \"Youngworth and Connor could never produce adequate proof that they had access to the Gardner collection.\" Connor was sent back to his cell in Pennsylvania and Youngworth found himself back in the dock. </p> <p>But the point the authorities refused to address is that the analysis showed that the samples were equally consistent with that other 17th-century Dutch master on the missing list, Vermeer's The Concert. \"No one other than Professor McCrone ever said the paint chips came from the Rembrandt,\" says Youngworth pointedly. It's a statement endorsed by Mashberg, who says that the police were looking for a way out of the negotiations. \"Youngworth was behaving like a sleazy con man,\" he says. \"He made everybody nervous. He was the kind of person who made inflammatory remarks, and the feds decided to take it personally. They didn't want a deal with men like these.\" Prosecutors seized Youngworth on outstanding criminal charges, one of which, possession of the stolen van, stuck - in November 1997, he was sentenced to three years in jail. </p> <p>Youngworth insists that he was framed, alleging that the van was planted by a police informant. He recalls the authorities' withdrawal from the negotiating table with bitterness: \"Basically, their currency is image,\" he says. \"If they can't kick in a door and hold a press conference, then they don't want to deal with it.\" </p> <p>The reality seems to have been a little more complex. Many officials at the Gardner museum, and also some officers at the FBI, did favour some form of compromise, but those higher up in the legal establishment had no desire to send such a message to the criminal fraternity at large. The attorney general's office in Washington warned against pandering to \"cultural terrorism\". Alan Dershowitz, the celebrated Boston defence lawyer and himself a keen art collector, spells it out: \"It's a very short-sighted policy. If, in the end, we pay for these pictures, there will be 10 more pieces of art stolen in the next decade by people who say, 'Look, they stole the Rembrandt, they got rich, why not us?'\" </p> <p>For Youngworth, imprisonment was not necessarily the worst aspect of late 1997. He started receiving messages from unnamed criminals threatening the kidnap of his six-year-old son if he didn't hand over the paintings to them. And then, soon after that, his wife was found dead at home, apparently after taking an accidental drugs overdose. His son has since been taken into state care. </p> <p>Since then, Youngworth has devoted much of his time to pursuing an exhaustive appeal claim and writing angry letters threatening vengeance on all those whom he believes have conspired to destroy him. He says the federal authorities have not let up trying to pitch deals at him, even though he's in jail, offering him early release in return for relevant information. </p> <p>\"He doesn't respond well to pressure tactics,\" says Mashberg, who has come to know Youngworth as well as most. \"He gets very angry. He'll sit in jail for 15 years out of spite, rather than tell them anything.\" </p> <p> Thankfully for Youngworth, he has not had to sit behind bars for quite that long. Despite a hard-fought attempt by state prosecutors to attach a so-called \"habitual offender\" tag to his sentence, he walked free from the Massachusetts' South-Eastern Correctional Centre in September this year. He still maintains that he has access to those holding the Gardner collection, but adds that he would be reluctant to cut a deal now. \"I just want to walk away from this whole thing,\" he says. \"The prerequisite for my co-operation is that somebody is going to have to admit what they did to me, and why.\" No one seems likely to do that, even if Youngworth's claims of victimisation were to be judicially upheld. </p> <p>Unofficially, many believe that Youngworth, despite his claims, no longer holds the key to the missing treasure. One theory goes that Connor may have inherited the collection from fellow thieves while he was in jail and that Youngworth took custody of them on a temporary basis only. \"Youngworth went through all of Connor's belongings after he went to jail,\" suggests one source. \"He might easily have stumbled across these paintings in the false bottom of some kind of case.\" It's a theory that Connor has tacitly encouraged. </p> <p>Hardly shy of the media himself, Connor has admitted in one interview to devising a plan to rob the Gardner museum, a scheme that he claims two other criminals copied without his knowledge. He then named the men as a sometime hitman Robert Denadi, and another Connor associate, David Houghton, both of whom died in the 90s. While the two would fit the profile of potential art thieves, nothing has ever been established to link them to the Gardner heist. </p> <p>Released from jail in June this year, the 57-year-old Connor recently suffered a stroke and now says that he has retired from crime, hinting that he is now more interested in possible book and movie contracts. But, like Youngworth, he still claims that he can help expedite the paintings' return, if he were given the go-ahead from the authorities, although he also says that he doesn't personally know of their whereabouts. \"I believe they remain in the Boston area,\" he says, \"within a 40-mile radius of the city.\" </p> <p>It is not known how Connor's offer has been received by the FBI, but, given its experiences in this case so far, the bureau is unlikely to say much publicly from now on anyway. Cassano, reflecting on the dilemmas of deal-making, says, \"Would I pay a reward to someone I knew had something to do with the theft or was holding the paintings? No, I'd be hard pushed to do something like that.\" Nonetheless, I suggest, haven't certain stones remained unturned for the sake of legal principle. No, he insists, the recovery of the paintings is still \"our absolute, number-one priority\". </p> <p>Speaking for the Gardner museum, spokeswoman Joan Norris remains upbeat. \"I'm confident that the paintings will be returned. Plenty of artworks have come to light 10, even 20 years after a theft.\" But such statements suggest as much hope as expectation. The fear remains that, without any kind of deal or offer of immunity on the table, the paintings could simply be left to rot by their new owners, or worse - most famously, Caravaggio's Adoration, stolen from Palermo in 1969, is believed by some to have been destroyed by mafiosi once it was felt that there was no longer an easy way of making a profit on the picture. Nonetheless, Cassano is still confident. Both he and Norris welcomed my requests for interview, implying that even an article printed on the other side of the Atlantic might help prompt useful leads in the quest for the Gardner's treasures. </p> <p>Mashberg, meanwhile, still believes that Connor is the most likely conduit: \"The feds' biggest regret was not calling Youngworth's bluff in 1997.\" Instead, at least in the public eye, they stood firm. The difference now is that Connor, New England's most influential art thief, is out of jail and, unlike Youngworth, he knows how to play the system like a professional. </p> <p>If and when the collection ever does resurface, Mashberg says that there's no guarantee that the public will learn about the Faustian bargains that were struck to retrieve them. \"Enough time will have gone by and the police will say, 'This guy Connor has gone straight, and now he's helped the museum. So what?'\" Like a model Boston citizen? \"Right,\" says Mashberg, \"a model citizen.\" The authorities may be dealing with the devil, but out of the public gaze they may still feel that this is a deal worth making.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a frosty October morning in 1997, a small-time criminal named William Youngworth III spoke to reporters outside a Boston gallery. In tones suggesting fatigue and frustration, he warned them that time was running out to resolve one of the most serious art crimes of the century: \"They have an opportunity to recover this stuff, a serious opportunity. You know this isn't a joke. The door is closing.\" The \"stuff\" to which he referred was the world's most prized haul of stolen artworks - artworks described as priceless and irreplaceable by their one-time proud owners, the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum in Boston. But the deal Youngworth was offering was never reached. And within weeks he found himself beginning a three-year jail term. His role in the fraught negotiations to retrieve the Gardner's collection went to the heart of the moral dilemmas facing law enforcers pursuing high-value stolen art; it also offered a telling insight into the modus operandi of a criminal go-between The armed raid that took place just after midnight on Sunday, March 18, 1990, was dazzlingly simple. Two men dressed as police officers approached a side door of the Boston museum. There had been a nearby disturbance, they told the guard inside, and they needed to ensure that everything was all right inside the building. Ignoring official guidelines, the guard agreed to open the door, and within minutes he and another colleague found themselves bound and gagged on the floor. The primitive security system did not include alarms on the individual artworks, so the thieves could work at their leisure, in an 80-minute spree relieving the museum of 13 pieces in total: 11 paintings and sketches, including works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Manet and Degas; a 3,000-year-old Chinese beaker; and the bronzed top of a Napoleonic flagstaff. Strangely, they failed to take the museum's most prized work, Titian's Rape Of Europa, which was left untouched, even though it has been described by experts as arguably the greatest painting in America. Nonetheless, the loss was devastating enough. Estimates vary, but they all easily outstrip the valuations of any other theft since the second world war. Most experts price the value of the stolen works at well over $300 million (around \u00a3210 million). For the fine arts community, it was a seismic blow. The head office of the Art Loss Register in London catalogues two of the stolen canvases - Rembrandt's Storm On The Sea Of Galilee and Vermeer's The Concert, one of only 35 by the painter in existence - as the most prized individual artworks currently missing anywhere in the world. And staff at the Gardner museum still lament the theft in emotive terms. \"It's been like a death in the family,\" said Anne Hawley, who had been the museum's director for just five months when the crime occurred. \"I've never really recovered from the loss or stopped mourning. This has been a real tragedy, not just for Boston, but for the world. Art exists for the beholder, and to believe that it would be forever lost, hidden in a warehouse someplace, never again to be appreciated, is unspeakably sad.\" The crime scene itself produced very little evidence for the police to go on. The two male thieves had been masked and gloved, and said little, according to the guards, except for this tantalising parting shot: \"You'll be hearing from us.\" That promise prompted speculation that the crooks believed that the paintings were insured (they were not), and were banking on a ransom deal. Such deals, though prohibited under most legal systems, are not unheard of in the art world, with thieves usually offering the paintings' return for a small fraction of their market value. \"I know of plenty of cases of such deals happening,\" says one of Britain's leading art loss-adjusters, Charles Hill. \"I think it's outrageous, but it happens.\" However, in the decade since the theft, neither the authorities nor the museum say they have received any formal ransom demand. More than 2,000 leads have been pursued, taking investigators as far afield as Japan, Latin America and Europe. One suspicion tied the theft to the IRA, which has strong links within Boston's large Irish community, not least because, at around the time of the Gardner heist, IRA operatives were known to be dabbling in the laundering of stolen art as a means of raising funds. For all the theories, the missing works of art did not resurface. Paintings of such value could scarcely be traded publicly anywhere in the world without the alarm being raised, according to Tom Cassano, the FBI officer who has been in charge of the investigation throughout. He expresses bemusement: \"It's the biggest whodunnit I've ever worked on, as well as the most frustrating. We haven't got a clue as to who is responsible.\" Some would say that such statements should not be taken entirely at face value, given the FBI's role in the later events of 1997. The situation developed quietly enough. William Youngworth, a small-time antiques dealer from the Boston area with a not-inconsiderable criminal record, found himself the subject of increasing police attention. He cut an unlikely figure as a supposed criminal mastermind: a shambling, overweight man in his late 30s, Youngworth lived unpretentiously in a Boston suburb, his lifestyle providing nothing to indicate a man who had profited from the art heist of the century - in fact, he had been in jail when the robbery took place. Even so, police informants were still naming him as a possible link. \"They raided my house,\" says Youngworth. \"They turned everything over.\" In a large garage packed full of antiques, the police failed to find anything incriminating, except the butt of a marijuana joint, three antique firearms and a stolen van, on which basis they immediately charged him. It was, according to Youngworth, the first of numerous attempts to pursuade him to co-operate. At first, he denied he could be of any help. \"I tried to push this away from me,\" he said. \"I tried to explain that I really didn't know anything.\" In return for the police dropping the charges against him, he says, he engineered the return of a royal seal dating back to the 17th century, one that had been stolen some years earlier. But this tactic backfired, seeming only to whet the FBI's appetite. State attorney Marty Leppo said that the authorities were now convinced they had a lead: \"When he returned the seal, somebody said, 'What else can you do? How about the Gardner?' And then, all of a sudden, Youngworth is in the newspaper.\" Police sources were rumoured to have been behind the leak to the Boston press of his suspected link to the Gardner collection. Tom Mashberg of the Boston Herald was one of the first to sniff a story. Indeed, he takes much of the credit for persuading Youngworth to go public at this stage. \"What we did, in the grand tradition of tabloid newspapers, is that we smoked him out,\" says Mashberg. \"We put some heat on him. And it took about three articles with his name in it before he said, 'Maybe you want to talk to me before you write your next story.'\" Youngworth concedes that the Herald's approach worked. \"Basically, Mashberg extorted me,\" he says. \"He said the pressure in the newspapers was going to become much worse if I didn't agree to help him with his story.\" The heavy pressure may have forced Youngworth's hand, but involving the media may also have been a tactic that the authorities later came to regret. Youngworth would deal, but only on his terms. The Gardner museum had already raised a reward, by way of private donors, for the return of the collection. This at first totalled $1 million. But in 1997, it went up to $5 million, by far the largest reward ever known in connection with an art theft. Rewards are not, of course, unusual in themselves - insurers regard cash incentives as by far the most effective way to uncover art crooks, although, publicly at least, there are strict rules governing their payment. Above all, for obvious reasons, the money should not go to anyone implicated in the theft itself, and typically the reward should lead to at least one prosecution. On the other hand, it's common knowledge that those who receive such rewards are unlikely to be paragons of virtue. Added to which, it is not always easy to sift out who finally ends up with the money once it has been paid. Mashberg puts it succinctly: \"When you put $5 million on the table, you hope that it's Mother Teresa who returns the artwork. More than likely, it'll be somebody in the criminal underworld.\" For Youngworth, the $5 million was only his first demand. He also asked federal negotiators for immunity from prosecution. Believing that they'd tricked him over the return of the seal, he also asked for cast-iron legal guarantees. He says it was only when he started talking about putting things in writing that they started to prevaricate. \"All of a sudden, they wanted me to turn the stuff in first, and then they would discuss a reward afterwards. I said no way. I wasn't going to fall on my sword for them.\" The state prosecutor, Donald Stern, denies that any verbal offers were made. But he does concede opening talks with Youngworth, who by this stage had decided to use the media to his advantage. He appeared on local television saying that he had definite access to the art haul. But now he was upping his demands. He wanted not just the money and immunity, but also the release of his long-term friend and associate, Myles Connor. Connor, at that time serving an 11-year jail term for armed robbery in Pennsylvania, was already a byword for art crime in New England - according to one Boston investigator, when any art went missing in Boston, the first question was always: \"Where was Myles?\" With Connor's sudden entry into the whole equation, law enforcers may well have felt a cold shudder down their collective spines.

Most famously, in 1975, he apparently negotiated the drastic reduction of one art theft charge against him by returning the proceeds of another, a Rembrandt, which at the time was the most precious artwork ever to have been stolen in the US. Extraordinarily, Connor now admits to having stolen the Dutch master himself from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts while on bail for the other thefts. \"He's beaten the system before and he's got away with it,\" says private investigator Charlie Moore. \"I don't know anyone who's been as successful as he has.\" Like Youngworth, Connor was in jail at the time of the Gardner heist and was therefore not a direct suspect, but few could now dismiss the suspicion that he had masterminded the operation from behind bars, and was attempting one of his trademark scams to extort police concessions.

Plenty of artworks have come to light 10, even 20 years after a theft.\" But such statements suggest as much hope as expectation. The fear remains that, without any kind of deal or offer of immunity on the table, the paintings could simply be left to rot by their new owners, or worse - most famously, Caravaggio's Adoration, stolen from Palermo in 1969, is believed by some to have been destroyed by mafiosi once it was felt that there was no longer an easy way of making a profit on the picture. Nonetheless, Cassano is still confident. Both he and Norris welcomed my requests for interview, implying that even an article printed on the other side of the Atlantic might help prompt useful leads in the quest for the Gardner's treasures. Mashberg, meanwhile, still believes that Connor is the most likely conduit: \"The feds' biggest regret was not calling Youngworth's bluff in 1997.\" Instead, at least in the public eye, they stood firm. The difference now is that Connor, New England's most influential art thief, is out of jail and, unlike Youngworth, he knows how to play the system like a professional. If and when the collection ever does resurface, Mashberg says that there's no guarantee that the public will learn about the Faustian bargains that were struck to retrieve them. \"Enough time will have gone by and the police will say, 'This guy Connor has gone straight, and now he's helped the museum. So what?'\" Like a model Boston citizen? \"Right,\" says Mashberg, \"a model citizen.\" The authorities may be dealing with the devil, but out of the public gaze they may still feel that this is a deal worth making.",

      "body": "<p>We were an unlikely cast for an African adventure - a secretary, two insurance brokers, a schoolgirl, a couple of mature students, a mum and a management consultant. Yet in five days, we cycled a 200-mile circuit on dirt roads around Laikipia, a beautiful plateau the size of Wales five hours' drive north of Nairobi in the central Kenyan highlands. </p> <p>The region is well known for its wildlife conservation and we were raising money that will be invested back into local projects, via Save the Rhino, the charity that organised our trip. </p> <p><strong> How was the cycling?</strong><br> </p> <p>On paper, the challenge sounded like a Herculean task. In reality, it was tough but never arduous - 40 miles a day is not a huge distance to travel. Our belongings were transported, along with the \"tented camp\" each day. </p> <p>And, although the bumpy roads and the midday sun ensured that we were happy to reach each day's destination, nobody was ever reluctant to begin the following morning. </p> <p>In terms of cycling experience, the nine-person team could not have been more diverse: one person had ridden across continents, another around Solihull. In age, we ranged from 18 to 37. </p> <p>In fitness, we covered the spectrum from marathon runners to busy housewives. However, we all kept the same pace and nobody complained. Regular stops for water, punctures and photographic opportunities ironed out the differences. </p> <p>No one used the support vehicle to hitch a ride, but we had all done some training. Sharon, a secretary from Birmingham, was probably the least experienced cyclist. Her training regime was 30 miles twice a week for three months - the minimum you could get away with and enjoy the challenge. </p> <p><strong> The bike</strong><br> </p> <p>I took the bike that I use to commute across London every day - a solid, no frills mountain bike worth \u00a3350. You could not get away with anything less, but more - namely a bike with front suspension forks - would improve life in the saddle. Out of the nine riders, five of us brought bikes from the UK. The rest hired from Bike Treks, the ground operator based in Nairobi, for $50. </p> <p>Charles, the mechanic, fixed emergency repairs by the roadside and major problems in the evenings. We kept him busy oiling gears and repairing punctures: though people tried gel-filled tyres and reinforced tubes, they were still no match for the thorns of the African bush. </p> <p><strong> Was there much wildlife in the bush?</strong><br> </p> <p>A huge amount - Laikipia is one of the few areas in East Africa where game numbers have risen in the last 20 years. The ride was across a number of vast, privately-owned \"ranches\", where the game roamed freely. On one occasion, giraffe, eland, gazelle, zebra, buffalo and baboons swept across the road in front of us beneath the Loldaiga hills. </p> <p>The whole point of being on a bike was that there were countless opportunities to see the wildlife at very close quarters. Herds of elephant rumbled past us as well as kudu, impala, warthog and dik-dik. </p> <p>One evening, we saw four young male cheetahs skulking in the yellow grass. Nigel, our guide, was able to settle any anxiety we had about the proximity of the big game, as well as help to identify many of the great African birds - Goliath herons, Marshall eagles, hammerkops and vultures to name a few. We also had impromptu lessons on the medicinal qualities of various acacia trees and in identifying animal spoors. </p> <p>On the last day, and without bikes, we visited the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to track rhino, endangered beasts that some of the money raised will specifically benefit. </p> <p><strong> The daily routine</strong><br> </p> <p>Each morning, Kip, the camp cook, woke us at 6am with a bowl of hot water delivered to our tents. By 7.30am, we had packed, breakfasted, braved the mobile loo - a hole in the ground with a canvas awning - applied factor 15 and filled our bottles with boiled water. </p> <p>By 1pm, we would be at the next campsite, ready for a swim and lunch. The afternoons were spent lazing in the shade, reading and writing diaries. By 6pm, washed and brushed, we were sipping \"sundowners\" around huge campfires. </p> <p>On a couple of evenings we had some arbitrary entertainment - two Maasai tribesmen talked to us about their customs and the director of a local wildlife research centre told us about the Laikipia ecosystem. </p> <p>Dinner was taken at 8pm and by 10pm, we were all zipped up in our sleeping bags, listening to the trill of the bush and the distant hooting of hyenas. </p> <p><strong> Camping and food</strong><br> </p> <p>We slept in small, single tents which we erected each night and ate under a canvas mess. All the campsites were in wonderful locations - by rivers and waterfalls, on sandy luggas (dry riverbeds) and in deep bush. I chose to wash in the rivers (crocodile free, I was assured), but there were hot showers on request. </p> <p>For city-dwellers, the brilliance of the stars and the serenity of the bush took some getting used to. For Brummie Sharon, night one was a trauma. This was her maiden trip to Africa and her first time in a tent. After campfire stories about man-eating lions, she had a sleepless night, clutching her torch. But, by the end of the week, she was relishing the wilderness almost as much as the Maasai. </p> <p>Head chef MC and Kip marshalled a team of men who constructed the remainder of the camp and prepared the food. Meals were not epicurean, but borstal fare would have appealed after six hours of pedalling. Breakfast was fresh fruit and porridge followed by eggs and bacon, washed down with campfire coffee that moved my insides faster than a charging rhino. We ate packed lunches by the side of the road. Dinner was three courses - soup, meat and a sweet. </p> <p>Drinking water was boiled and cooled. We paid for our own beer and drank plenty of it. There was nearly a mutiny one night when we ran out. The alternative was Safari Cane, a mean local hooch, which had us all, well, caned on safari. </p> <p>A vehicle followed us every day, carrying water, drinks and bananas. We all had our own energy snacks - everything from dextrose to Kendal mint cake - and these little luxuries counted for a great deal when we were exhausted at the start of a hill. </p> <p><strong> Would I do it again?</strong><br> </p> <p>On the final day of our ride, we were chased into the campsite by thrashing rain.

      "bodyText": "We were an unlikely cast for an African adventure - a secretary, two insurance brokers, a schoolgirl, a couple of mature students, a mum and a management consultant. Yet in five days, we cycled a 200-mile circuit on dirt roads around Laikipia, a beautiful plateau the size of Wales five hours' drive north of Nairobi in the central Kenyan highlands. The region is well known for its wildlife conservation and we were raising money that will be invested back into local projects, via Save the Rhino, the charity that organised our trip. How was the cycling? On paper, the challenge sounded like a Herculean task. In reality, it was tough but never arduous - 40 miles a day is not a huge distance to travel. Our belongings were transported, along with the \"tented camp\" each day. And, although the bumpy roads and the midday sun ensured that we were happy to reach each day's destination, nobody was ever reluctant to begin the following morning. In terms of cycling experience, the nine-person team could not have been more diverse: one person had ridden across continents, another around Solihull. In age, we ranged from 18 to 37. In fitness, we covered the spectrum from marathon runners to busy housewives. However, we all kept the same pace and nobody complained. Regular stops for water, punctures and photographic opportunities ironed out the differences. No one used the support vehicle to hitch a ride, but we had all done some training. Sharon, a secretary from Birmingham, was probably the least experienced cyclist. Her training regime was 30 miles twice a week for three months - the minimum you could get away with and enjoy the challenge. The bike I took the bike that I use to commute across London every day - a solid, no frills mountain bike worth \u00a3350. You could not get away with anything less, but more - namely a bike with front suspension forks - would improve life in the saddle. Out of the nine riders, five of us brought bikes from the UK. The rest hired from Bike Treks, the ground operator based in Nairobi, for $50. Charles, the mechanic, fixed emergency repairs by the roadside and major problems in the evenings. We kept him busy oiling gears and repairing punctures: though people tried gel-filled tyres and reinforced tubes, they were still no match for the thorns of the African bush. Was there much wildlife in the bush? A huge amount - Laikipia is one of the few areas in East Africa where game numbers have risen in the last 20 years. The ride was across a number of vast, privately-owned \"ranches\", where the game roamed freely. On one occasion, giraffe, eland, gazelle, zebra, buffalo and baboons swept across the road in front of us beneath the Loldaiga hills. The whole point of being on a bike was that there were countless opportunities to see the wildlife at very close quarters. Herds of elephant rumbled past us as well as kudu, impala, warthog and dik-dik. One evening, we saw four young male cheetahs skulking in the yellow grass. Nigel, our guide, was able to settle any anxiety we had about the proximity of the big game, as well as help to identify many of the great African birds - Goliath herons, Marshall eagles, hammerkops and vultures to name a few. We also had impromptu lessons on the medicinal qualities of various acacia trees and in identifying animal spoors. On the last day, and without bikes, we visited the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to track rhino, endangered beasts that some of the money raised will specifically benefit. The daily routine Each morning, Kip, the camp cook, woke us at 6am with a bowl of hot water delivered to our tents. By 7.30am, we had packed, breakfasted, braved the mobile loo - a hole in the ground with a canvas awning - applied factor 15 and filled our bottles with boiled water. By 1pm, we would be at the next campsite, ready for a swim and lunch. The afternoons were spent lazing in the shade, reading and writing diaries. By 6pm, washed and brushed, we were sipping \"sundowners\" around huge campfires. On a couple of evenings we had some arbitrary entertainment - two Maasai tribesmen talked to us about their customs and the director of a local wildlife research centre told us about the Laikipia ecosystem. Dinner was taken at 8pm and by 10pm, we were all zipped up in our sleeping bags, listening to the trill of the bush and the distant hooting of hyenas. Camping and food We slept in small, single tents which we erected each night and ate under a canvas mess. All the campsites were in wonderful locations - by rivers and waterfalls, on sandy luggas (dry riverbeds) and in deep bush. I chose to wash in the rivers (crocodile free, I was assured), but there were hot showers on request. For city-dwellers, the brilliance of the stars and the serenity of the bush took some getting used to. For Brummie Sharon, night one was a trauma. This was her maiden trip to Africa and her first time in a tent. After campfire stories about man-eating lions, she had a sleepless night, clutching her torch. But, by the end of the week, she was relishing the wilderness almost as much as the Maasai. Head chef MC and Kip marshalled a team of men who constructed the remainder of the camp and prepared the food. Meals were not epicurean, but borstal fare would have appealed after six hours of pedalling. Breakfast was fresh fruit and porridge followed by eggs and bacon, washed down with campfire coffee that moved my insides faster than a charging rhino. We ate packed lunches by the side of the road. Dinner was three courses - soup, meat and a sweet. Drinking water was boiled and cooled. We paid for our own beer and drank plenty of it. There was nearly a mutiny one night when we ran out. The alternative was Safari Cane, a mean local hooch, which had us all, well, caned on safari. A vehicle followed us every day, carrying water, drinks and bananas. We all had our own energy snacks - everything from dextrose to Kendal mint cake - and these little luxuries counted for a great deal when we were exhausted at the start of a hill. Would I do it again? On the final day of our ride, we were chased into the campsite by thrashing rain. As we came roaring down the last hill to reach the Ngare Ndare River, a herd of impala exploded in every direction, leaping over rocks and fallen trees - a dramatic end to our challenge. Under the dripping mess tent, slugging Tusker beer, the bold talk was not if we would all do it together again next year, but where. \u00b7 For more information on the Rhino Cycle Kenya 2001, to be run next September, and other Rhino Adventures, contact: Save the Rhino at adventures@rhinos.demon.co.uk or check the website at www.savetherhino.com.

You may be forgiven for laughing - in fact, I challenge you not to laugh. The more serious lapses, dealing with which remains the main purpose of the corrections column, you will not find in the book, for obvious reasons. </p> <p>To be even clearer about it, only about one-third of the book is made up of corrections and clarifications. The rest comprises 50 or so of these Open Door columns in which a wide variety of subjects concerning the Guardian, raised by readers, is discussed. </p> <p>Several of the columns deal with Guardian English, including its (continuing) tolerance of expletives, although one effect of reader interest in this area was the introduction of guidelines by the editor. These are now incorporated in the style guide, which those of you with website access may consult for yourselves.

      "bodyText": "The book of corrections and clarifications that many of you have been asking for comes out next week (details below). To be clear about it, it contains a selection of only the more humorous entries from the daily corrections column, in practically all of which the joke is on us. You may be forgiven for laughing - in fact, I challenge you not to laugh. The more serious lapses, dealing with which remains the main purpose of the corrections column, you will not find in the book, for obvious reasons. To be even clearer about it, only about one-third of the book is made up of corrections and clarifications. The rest comprises 50 or so of these Open Door columns in which a wide variety of subjects concerning the Guardian, raised by readers, is discussed. Several of the columns deal with Guardian English, including its (continuing) tolerance of expletives, although one effect of reader interest in this area was the introduction of guidelines by the editor. These are now incorporated in the style guide, which those of you with website access may consult for yourselves. Those of you who read the Guardian only on the website may be less interested than our terrestrial readers in the piece explaining why the ink rubs off on your hands, which is also included. A good number of the columns I have chosen to reprint deal with ethical questions: for instance, to do with our use of pictures of people killed in wars and atrocities around the world, where we gradually appear to have extended the boundaries of what is thought to be permissible in terms of photography.

Within 10 years, he suggests, such a column will be commonplace in tabloids. One of the things that the daily, inexorable revelation of the paper's errors has done is concentrate minds inside the paper on efforts to reduce their number. The deputy editor (news) says there is a real will to do this, and that the column has reinforced this by heightening everyone's awareness of pitfalls. The question asked in exasperation at the revelation of so many errors, even on occasion by those who welcome the frankness of the corrections, is: yes, but what are you actually doing about it? In the first place, more frequent investigations are being carried out to trace the sources of mistakes, not for punitive purposes but to try to understand what went wrong and avoid a similar thing happening again. The electronic technology makes it comparatively easy to do that now, with successive versions of a story or page retrievable with the names of the editors who handled them at each stage. The setup for revising material before publication is being looked at again, with the aim of making sure that each department has an adequate system and that responsibility for ensuring that corrections are made is clearly defined.

The sound we shopophobics dread most is the assistant saying: \"May I help you, sir?\" or \"Are you looking for anything in particular?\" If I were Elton John I would say: \"No, no, just give me 18 diamante encrusted sunglasses, 72 silk shirts, collar size 16, doesn't matter what colour, throw in a solid gold turtle, and let me out!\" </p> <p>Women by contrast love the whole process of shopping. The other day my daughter and her friend set off for the pictures three hours early in order, they explained, to do a little shopping on the way. \"But you've only got \u00a35,\" I said, \"you'll have spent that in 10 minutes.\" My reward was the look which translates as the pitying cry of \"D-a-a-a-d.\" To them shopping doesn't mean buying anything; it means hanging around in shops.

She got her revenge this week by claiming the two of them had once made love in a total of 9 seconds. The Sun, our new paper of record, was so impressed that it made a breakthrough in political reporting by recreating the event through the use of computer graphics.

When I lived in America, I used to hate the New York Times equivalent; they were frightfully pompous about being sorry for a wrong age, or a misspelled \"Phillip\", but never said: \"In our recent editorials, we may have given the impression that the government of Israel has been almost blameless in the present crisis.

The entry on page 10, about the spectacular mistakes in an article about deaths in soap operas, is almost worth the \u00a36.99 alone. And who can forget the interview with the black Tory-voting chanteuse, Patti Boulaye, in which she was quoted as supporting \"apartheid... you can't stop supporting apartheid just because it's unpopular\". She actually said \"a party\". Mel Torme, whose voice has been called \"velvet fog\" appeared in the Guardian as \"the velvet frog\". And it was hard to know whether to laugh or cry about the native American \"unjustly lunched for rape\". </p> <p>Unlike most of the people who hammer on about the Millennium Dome, I went back to it this week.

      "body": "<p>For consumers who want to combine giving to friends and family with giving to good causes this Christmas, the internet now offers the convenience of being able to buy charity cards and gifts from home. </p> <p>All the major charities have their own websites, most with the facility to order their Christmas catalogues online. And many now offer full-blown internet shopping sites where you can order and pay for goods online. </p> <p>A large number of charity catalogues with online buying facilities, including those of Save the Children, Mencap, NSPCC, The Cancer Research Campaign, British Heart Foundation, RSPCA and British Red Cross, can be accessed through one generic site, <a href=\"http://www.charitygifts.com\">www.charitygifts.com</a>. </p> <p>This is run by Webb Ivory, the biggest fulfilment agency, which produces and runs the catalogue operations on behalf of many charities in return for a straight percentage of sales. Webb Ivory typically does all the work for larger charities covering costs associated with the design, production, printing and distribution of their catalogue as well as the purchase, storage and fulfilment of all the products and cards and the provision of telephone and online ordering services. </p> <p>What this means for the charity is a riskless deal where they are guaranteed a royalty percentage of the retail value plus all unsolicited donations their catalogues raise. With such deals, 25% of the sales price is a reasonable estimate of the clear profit passed on to the charity. This means that \u00a35 of every \u00a320 you spend on cards and gifts goes directly to benefit the cause in question. </p> <p>If, however, you buy direct from one of the big charities which produce and run their own catalogues, such as Oxfam, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Barnardo's and the RNLI, chances are that a larger slice of the price you pay will be clear profit used to further the cause. This \"net revenue\" figure - the final profit after all trading costs have been deducted - varies from charity to charity depending on its size and commerical acuity. </p> <p>Oxfam, for example, says that once all costs are paid around 35% of the sales price of cards sold through its catalogue (by mail order or via its internet shopping site) is clear profit used to forward its work around the world. </p> <p>One drawback of buying charity products via mail order, whether online or not, is that you pay for postage and packaging. This makes it costly to buy products from several different charities and more economic to place a large order with just one or two favourite causes. </p> <p>For smaller orders with standard delivery, where you would expect to receive your goods within 14 days, p&amp;p varies between \u00a32 and \u00a33.75, depending on the charity, and some charities offer free p&amp;p for larger orders. </p> <p>One way around this is to order from collaborative websites which sell cards on behalf of a range of charities. One contender is <a href=\"http://www.charitycards.co.uk\">www.charitycards.co.uk</a> run by Newcastle-based The Greetings Card Company, a commercial operation which sells 200 different designs of cards from 25 participating charities including Age Concern, Shelter, Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Amnesty International. Pack prices vary from \u00a31.75 up to \u00a34.99 for 10 cards and customers pay the postage rate of their choice. </p> <p>The company buys cards from the charities to sell online, giving them back 66% of the ex-VAT selling price. On a \u00a33 pack, for example, VAT is first taken off, leaving a \u00a32.55 ex-VAT value of which 66% (\u00a31.69) goes to the charity. </p> <p>This does not, of course, mean that the entire 66% represents clear profit for each charity. The \"net revenue\" figure will vary depending on each charity's card production costs, which have to be deducted first. And it is hard for consumers to compare which charities actually benefit the most from their card sales because not only do charities tend to calculate net revenue in different ways but they rarely, if ever, publicise this figure, which they view as commercially sensitive. </p> <p> A smaller, non-profit making online venture, <a href=\"http://www.christmas-cards.org.uk\">www.christmas-cards.org.uk,</a> is run voluntarily by the Combined Charities Christmas Shops, which also runs temporary seasonal card shops in the Cheshire area. Selling cards online, it returns 100% of the sales price to 57 national and local charities from which, again, they each have to pay for card produc tion and costs. Delivery costs are a flat \u00a31.95 per order. </p> <p>Charity supporters who like sending flowers as Christmas gifts might be interested to know that they can make a \u00a31 donation to Macmillan Cancer Relief each time they place an order via internet same-day flower delivery site <a href=\"http://www.flowergram.co.uk\">www.flowergram.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>For traditional shoppers who prefer to do their charity card buying offline, charities which run their own high street shops will benefit the most if you buy their cards direct from them. Imperial Cancer Research Fund, for example, says that if people buy a \u00a32.99 pack of its cards at one of its own 440 shops, approximately \u00a31.50 (just under 50%) is convenanted to the cause. </p> <p>If your favourite charities have no shops, your next best bet is to buy from temporary card shops run by non-profit making organisations. Cards for Good Causes is this year running nearly 300 tempo rary shops in donated spaces around the country selling cards produced by its 25 member charities, plus a few guest charities, in return for a maximum 19p in the \u00a31 levy on sales to cover operating costs. This means that it returns 81p in the \u00a31 to charities, out of which each has to pay its production and distribution costs. </p> <p>Under a similar arrangement, Card Aid is running 45 temporary card shops on donated spaces mainly in London and the south-east where it is selling cards on behalf of up to 150 charities. </p> <p>Finally, commercial retailers including WH Smith, Boots, Marks &amp; Spencer and various supermarkets have licensing agreements with a number of charities to sell cards overprinted with their name in return for a royalty payment - typically 10% of the pack price. </p> <p>While 10% may not sound much - and retailers have been regularly criticised for not passing on a bigger slice - it is worth remembering that these returns are risk-free to charities. The retailers not only sell the cards but also bear all the production costs and take the risk on any leftover sales. Charities tend to view such royalties as a source of welcome extra income they would not otherwise get and benefit from the high turnover of sales in the major stores.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For consumers who want to combine giving to friends and family with giving to good causes this Christmas, the internet now offers the convenience of being able to buy charity cards and gifts from home. All the major charities have their own websites, most with the facility to order their Christmas catalogues online. And many now offer full-blown internet shopping sites where you can order and pay for goods online. A large number of charity catalogues with online buying facilities, including those of Save the Children, Mencap, NSPCC, The Cancer Research Campaign, British Heart Foundation, RSPCA and British Red Cross, can be accessed through one generic site, www.charitygifts.com. This is run by Webb Ivory, the biggest fulfilment agency, which produces and runs the catalogue operations on behalf of many charities in return for a straight percentage of sales. Webb Ivory typically does all the work for larger charities covering costs associated with the design, production, printing and distribution of their catalogue as well as the purchase, storage and fulfilment of all the products and cards and the provision of telephone and online ordering services. What this means for the charity is a riskless deal where they are guaranteed a royalty percentage of the retail value plus all unsolicited donations their catalogues raise. With such deals, 25% of the sales price is a reasonable estimate of the clear profit passed on to the charity. This means that \u00a35 of every \u00a320 you spend on cards and gifts goes directly to benefit the cause in question. If, however, you buy direct from one of the big charities which produce and run their own catalogues, such as Oxfam, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Barnardo's and the RNLI, chances are that a larger slice of the price you pay will be clear profit used to further the cause. This \"net revenue\" figure - the final profit after all trading costs have been deducted - varies from charity to charity depending on its size and commerical acuity. Oxfam, for example, says that once all costs are paid around 35% of the sales price of cards sold through its catalogue (by mail order or via its internet shopping site) is clear profit used to forward its work around the world. One drawback of buying charity products via mail order, whether online or not, is that you pay for postage and packaging. This makes it costly to buy products from several different charities and more economic to place a large order with just one or two favourite causes. For smaller orders with standard delivery, where you would expect to receive your goods within 14 days, p&amp;p varies between \u00a32 and \u00a33.75, depending on the charity, and some charities offer free p&amp;p for larger orders. One way around this is to order from collaborative websites which sell cards on behalf of a range of charities. One contender is www.charitycards.co.uk run by Newcastle-based The Greetings Card Company, a commercial operation which sells 200 different designs of cards from 25 participating charities including Age Concern, Shelter, Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Amnesty International. Pack prices vary from \u00a31.75 up to \u00a34.99 for 10 cards and customers pay the postage rate of their choice. The company buys cards from the charities to sell online, giving them back 66% of the ex-VAT selling price. On a \u00a33 pack, for example, VAT is first taken off, leaving a \u00a32.55 ex-VAT value of which 66% (\u00a31.69) goes to the charity. This does not, of course, mean that the entire 66% represents clear profit for each charity. The \"net revenue\" figure will vary depending on each charity's card production costs, which have to be deducted first. And it is hard for consumers to compare which charities actually benefit the most from their card sales because not only do charities tend to calculate net revenue in different ways but they rarely, if ever, publicise this figure, which they view as commercially sensitive. A smaller, non-profit making online venture, www.christmas-cards.org.uk, is run voluntarily by the Combined Charities Christmas Shops, which also runs temporary seasonal card shops in the Cheshire area. Selling cards online, it returns 100% of the sales price to 57 national and local charities from which, again, they each have to pay for card produc tion and costs. Delivery costs are a flat \u00a31.95 per order. Charity supporters who like sending flowers as Christmas gifts might be interested to know that they can make a \u00a31 donation to Macmillan Cancer Relief each time they place an order via internet same-day flower delivery site www.flowergram.co.uk. For traditional shoppers who prefer to do their charity card buying offline, charities which run their own high street shops will benefit the most if you buy their cards direct from them. Imperial Cancer Research Fund, for example, says that if people buy a \u00a32.99 pack of its cards at one of its own 440 shops, approximately \u00a31.50 (just under 50%) is convenanted to the cause. If your favourite charities have no shops, your next best bet is to buy from temporary card shops run by non-profit making organisations. Cards for Good Causes is this year running nearly 300 tempo rary shops in donated spaces around the country selling cards produced by its 25 member charities, plus a few guest charities, in return for a maximum 19p in the \u00a31 levy on sales to cover operating costs. This means that it returns 81p in the \u00a31 to charities, out of which each has to pay its production and distribution costs. Under a similar arrangement, Card Aid is running 45 temporary card shops on donated spaces mainly in London and the south-east where it is selling cards on behalf of up to 150 charities. Finally, commercial retailers including WH Smith, Boots, Marks &amp; Spencer and various supermarkets have licensing agreements with a number of charities to sell cards overprinted with their name in return for a royalty payment - typically 10% of the pack price. While 10% may not sound much - and retailers have been regularly criticised for not passing on a bigger slice - it is worth remembering that these returns are risk-free to charities. The retailers not only sell the cards but also bear all the production costs and take the risk on any leftover sales. Charities tend to view such royalties as a source of welcome extra income they would not otherwise get and benefit from the high turnover of sales in the major stores.",

Sadly, the fine diners and dancers didn't cotton on to this splendid concept, and China Jazz went down the Swanee. A few months later, Cassia Oriental arose from the ashes of receivership with a different owner, different concept and different food. And, having missed China Jazz's brief meteoric course across the horizon, it was to the Cassia Oriental that I went with Madame Feng Shui for dinner. </p> <p>I'm not sure how much of the original is left, but the whole thing is a sizeable operation, with a large bar for drinking, a sushi bar for raw fish and a dining room that will take around 100-plus, all quite flash in a dun-coloured kind of way.

Actually, she didn't get much to eat at all, because her beef teppanyaki wrap (\"pan-fried thin slices of sirloin beef rolled with garlic and enoki mushrooms garnished with asparagus and served in a teryaki sauce\") that came next proved to be nigh on inedible: the slices of beef were thin all right, and fibrous like damp linen, and they were wrapped around bundles of rubbery enokis, but that wisp, that hint, that vestigial shadow of taste defied analysis.

He is crazy about tender plants and succulents (especially aloes), and likes to have them outside during the summer. I asked about winter storage. \"What about the car?\" I asked, when he mentioned a garage. </p> <p> \"A car's never been in there. Cars aren't tender, anyway.\" I call that getting your priorities right. Succulents, if they are kept dry and unheated, will tolerate very low light levels for months on end. Dahlias and cannas need none, as they are dormant. We don't usually lift them until their tops have been frosted; then box them up in damp, old potting compost. </p> <p> If a frost refuses to materialise, we cut them down anyway and proceed as usual. But allowing the tubers of dahlias to go on withdrawing nutrients from the foliage until as late as there is some there does encourage them to plump up as much as is possible. Thin, spindly tubers are all too apt to shrivel and disappear in the course of the winter, so it is as well to water them from time to time without ever allowing them to become soaking wet (as can easily happen if the container is lined with plastic). </p> <p> The fleshy-rooted Colocasia esculenta (of the big elephant's ears foliage) and its relatives can be treated like dahlias. Begonias are of varying habits. The fibrous-rooted kinds so widely used for bedding are generally raised afresh from seed each year, sowing under heated glass in February. Tuberous-rooted begonias have their own in-built method of overwintering and are very little trouble. Their tubers can be completely dried off and stored in the dark, somewhere cool. Don't forget about them in the spring, or they'll start to sprout at all sorts of weird angles before you've dealt with their needs. Set them in damp peat in a warm spot, right side up - that is the slightly hollow side where shoots will be produced. </p> <p> But then there are all the other kinds of begonias that are never dormant; we bed masses of them out, too, although many owners keep them permanently as pot plants in house or conservatory. They may not need much winter heat and light - just enough to keep them ticking over. If they lose much foliage when we're bringing them in, it sets them back rather seriously the next spring, so we handle them gently and any necessary pruning is delayed until they are on the move come the spring. Dead or dying leaves must always be removed, as necessary, to prevent any rots from spreading. Some of them, such as Begonia fuchsioides and B. scharffii, never present the slightest problem. </p> <p> One of our favourites, the Egyptian papyrus, Cyperus papyrus, is distinctly tricky to overwinter. It is easy enough to raise afresh from seed in the spring, but that year's plants will be small. So we keep some of them in a greenhouse throughout the summer, and they are then no trouble to bring through the winter and can be bedded out in their second spring. The easiest thing with old plants, unless you can give them high winter temperatures, is to discard them. </p> <p> Some plants make a large proportion of their annual growth in the winter months. Geranium maderense and the shrubby Echium fastuosum are notable among these. They are just not hardy in our climate, except in warm seaside localities, and must have plenty of light and root room, although generous feeding will, in part, compensate for some of this. To have them flowering really well from March to May, or even June, is quite a triumph. </p> <p> The beautiful, lacy, grey-leaved Euryops pectinatus can make quite a large and spectacular shrub if well treated, and that will be covered with bright yellow daisies through a long spring season (but needs deadheading). It would go well with the blue spikes of the echium. Tender or near-tender ferns should generally be lifted and potted. They might have survived outside, but the winter will have acted as a severe check to their progress in the following spring. One of my favourites is the gun-metal-blue Polypodium aureum, and I have a pot of that on my dining room windowsill for six months. </p> <p> Impatiens tinctoria is a giant. The plant we left out last winter grew a couple of metres tall by July. Its roots are tuberous and we merely protected them with fern fronds. But you can't trust to luck. We also took cuttings from its young shoots in the spring - just as you would dahlias - and they will overwinter under frost-free glass. The charming mat-forming I. pseudoviola, with masses of cheeky little white, violet-like flowers, is utterly tender, so we have rooted plants of that for overwintering in small pots. </p> <p>The tall, herbaceous lobelias, such as 'Queen Victoria' and the F1 Fan series, die back to basal, leafy rosettes and they cannot be kept in the dark. We box them up and overwinter them in a snug, solid-walled cold frame. Tender shrubs, such as Grevillea robusta (initially seed-raised), we lift and pot more or less intact, not cutting them back for shape until there is enough light and warmth from the sun in February, to encourage them to make new growth.</p>",

The Cosham area hospital has the biggest accident and emergency unit in the south with a catchment area covering 600,000 people. </p> <p>This crisis follows reports this week which have criticised the running of the Oxford heart centre, condemned the treatment of elderly mental patients in Carlisle and warned of risk to patients from the failure to share procedures in two hospitals' operating theatres run by the Carmarthenshire health trust. </p> <p>The Portsmouth problems were revealed in a letter written by the surgeons on Monday to hospital management recommending that all admission of trauma victims should cease from November 27, by which time neighbouring units should be prepared to take extra patients. </p> <p>It said: \"Despite stopping elective surgery we have not seen any improvement in the supply of sterile instruments for trauma.

Morale in the orthopaedic department is at an all-time low.\" </p> <p>The Portsmouth Hospitals Trust acknowledged \"very slow progress\" in addressing problems but said it was \"working very hard to ensure that orthopaedic surgery continues at the Queen Alexandra Hospital.\" More instruments had been ordered. </p> <p>The suspension of elective surgery meant that about 200 operations were cancelled or postponed but some operations have been conducted since early this month at the military Royal Hospital, Haslar, in Gosport. </p> <p>Michael Mates, Conservative MP for Hampshire East, said he had raised concerns with health minister Gisela Stuart on three occasions in the last two months. </p> <p>The health department said: \"The hospital should not have let this situation develop. We expect them to take very swift action to sort out their sterilisation department, to make sure patients are safe and to deal with those who have had to wait for their operations. If they do not, we will consider action against the hospital managers involved.\"</p>",

This crisis follows reports this week which have criticised the running of the Oxford heart centre, condemned the treatment of elderly mental patients in Carlisle and warned of risk to patients from the failure to share procedures in two hospitals' operating theatres run by the Carmarthenshire health trust. The Portsmouth problems were revealed in a letter written by the surgeons on Monday to hospital management recommending that all admission of trauma victims should cease from November 27, by which time neighbouring units should be prepared to take extra patients. It said: \"Despite stopping elective surgery we have not seen any improvement in the supply of sterile instruments for trauma. Indeed the situation has become worse. We have previously taken the view that cancellation of trauma takes would put the patients at greater risk than continuing the service.\" But the doctors said the situation had changed in the previous two weeks and \"we now feel that patients' lives and well-being are at serious risk and this situation cannot be allowed to continue\". It is understood that last week staff took six hours to find suitable equipment to treat an elderly woman with a multiple fracture to her leg that needed surgery. Consultants might also have to reduce or stop seeing new patients. The surgeons' letter said they were \"extremely disappointed\" that concerns first raised in June had not been addressed. \"Our decision has not been taken lightly ... Morale in the orthopaedic department is at an all-time low.\" The Portsmouth Hospitals Trust acknowledged \"very slow progress\" in addressing problems but said it was \"working very hard to ensure that orthopaedic surgery continues at the Queen Alexandra Hospital.\" More instruments had been ordered. The suspension of elective surgery meant that about 200 operations were cancelled or postponed but some operations have been conducted since early this month at the military Royal Hospital, Haslar, in Gosport. Michael Mates, Conservative MP for Hampshire East, said he had raised concerns with health minister Gisela Stuart on three occasions in the last two months. The health department said: \"The hospital should not have let this situation develop. We expect them to take very swift action to sort out their sterilisation department, to make sure patients are safe and to deal with those who have had to wait for their operations. If they do not, we will consider action against the hospital managers involved.\"",

      "body": "<p>The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, called on Fatah militiamen yesterday to hold their fire, one of several tentative signs that Israel and the Palestinians are seeking an escape route from nearly two months of confrontation.</p> <p>Mr Arafat stopped short of banning the activities of the Fatah tanzim (militiamen) whose shooting at the Jewish settlement of Gilo, south of Jerusalem, has caused hysteria in Israel and provoked the ferocious retribution that has reduced many houses in the Christian town of Beit Jalla to smouldering wrecks.</p> <p>\"We are trying our best to get our people to stop shooting from Palestinian-controlled areas,\" he told reporters in Gaza after Friday afternoon prayers. \"There are orders from the Palestinian security council to stop shooting.\"</p> <p>But before that will happen Mr Arafat must persuade tanzim leaders such as Mike, the burly commander of a cell of gunmen in Beit Jalla.</p> <p>\"We are all working under Yasser Arafat's command, but unless he feels we are totally satisfied he is not going to ask us to stop shooting,\" he said, looking out over a valley of olive trees to his target, the multi-storey flats of Gilo along the spine of the opposite hill.</p> <p>\"We are all victims and economic losers, and he can not tell us to stop and go back home unless we are convinced that something has changed.\"</p> <p>Such determination is common among tanzim, from Mike, who has six gunmen under his charge, to Hussain Sheikh, their commander in the West Bank.</p> <p>During these weeks Mr Sheikh has not gone out without six guards dressed in black and armed with M-16 rifles with sniper scopes, for fear of an Israeli assassination attempt.</p> <p>Earlier this week he too said it was premature to end the guerrilla-style attacks on Israeli troops and Jewish settlers in the West Bank.</p> <p>\"In my opinion the Palestinian people are still the victims and are still paying a heavy price. The Palestinian people are not going to raise the white flag to the settlers and the army.\"</p> <p>Such attitudes could make it hard to call off the tanzim should Mr Arafat so decide. So too could the organisational structure of the tanzim, divided into small cells the length of the West Bank.</p> <p>From Jenin in the north to Hebron in the south, each cell operates as an autonomous unit. Most of their leaders are said not to know each other.</p> <p>\"The intifada has many leaders, and each can decide on his own what to do,\" said Abdullah Abu Hadid, who commands the tanzim in Bethlehem.</p> <p>Mr Arafat's call for restraint does not apply to tanzim operating in those parts of the West Bank under only partial Palestinian control or complete Israeli control. But it was one of several small encouraging signals that - for all the public assertions by the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, that now is not the time to talk peace - Israel and the Palestinians are working behind the scenes to re-open negotiations.</p> <p>Such efforts had no effect on the ground yesterday. Two Palestinian policemen were shot dead overnight near Jericho. Another man was killed by an Israeli bullet through the chest in the West Bank town of Qalqiliya.</p> <p>But there was a flicker of hope when newspapers reported that Israeli and Palestinian diplomats had held secret meetings at the UN to discuss the Palestinian demand for an international protection force in the West Bank.</p> <p>Mr Barak has, with Washington's backing, opposed such a force.

      "bodyText": "The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, called on Fatah militiamen yesterday to hold their fire, one of several tentative signs that Israel and the Palestinians are seeking an escape route from nearly two months of confrontation. Mr Arafat stopped short of banning the activities of the Fatah tanzim (militiamen) whose shooting at the Jewish settlement of Gilo, south of Jerusalem, has caused hysteria in Israel and provoked the ferocious retribution that has reduced many houses in the Christian town of Beit Jalla to smouldering wrecks. \"We are trying our best to get our people to stop shooting from Palestinian-controlled areas,\" he told reporters in Gaza after Friday afternoon prayers. \"There are orders from the Palestinian security council to stop shooting.\" But before that will happen Mr Arafat must persuade tanzim leaders such as Mike, the burly commander of a cell of gunmen in Beit Jalla. \"We are all working under Yasser Arafat's command, but unless he feels we are totally satisfied he is not going to ask us to stop shooting,\" he said, looking out over a valley of olive trees to his target, the multi-storey flats of Gilo along the spine of the opposite hill. \"We are all victims and economic losers, and he can not tell us to stop and go back home unless we are convinced that something has changed.\" Such determination is common among tanzim, from Mike, who has six gunmen under his charge, to Hussain Sheikh, their commander in the West Bank. During these weeks Mr Sheikh has not gone out without six guards dressed in black and armed with M-16 rifles with sniper scopes, for fear of an Israeli assassination attempt. Earlier this week he too said it was premature to end the guerrilla-style attacks on Israeli troops and Jewish settlers in the West Bank. \"In my opinion the Palestinian people are still the victims and are still paying a heavy price. The Palestinian people are not going to raise the white flag to the settlers and the army.\" Such attitudes could make it hard to call off the tanzim should Mr Arafat so decide. So too could the organisational structure of the tanzim, divided into small cells the length of the West Bank. From Jenin in the north to Hebron in the south, each cell operates as an autonomous unit. Most of their leaders are said not to know each other. \"The intifada has many leaders, and each can decide on his own what to do,\" said Abdullah Abu Hadid, who commands the tanzim in Bethlehem. Mr Arafat's call for restraint does not apply to tanzim operating in those parts of the West Bank under only partial Palestinian control or complete Israeli control. But it was one of several small encouraging signals that - for all the public assertions by the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, that now is not the time to talk peace - Israel and the Palestinians are working behind the scenes to re-open negotiations. Such efforts had no effect on the ground yesterday. Two Palestinian policemen were shot dead overnight near Jericho. Another man was killed by an Israeli bullet through the chest in the West Bank town of Qalqiliya. But there was a flicker of hope when newspapers reported that Israeli and Palestinian diplomats had held secret meetings at the UN to discuss the Palestinian demand for an international protection force in the West Bank. Mr Barak has, with Washington's backing, opposed such a force. But on Thursday night his office said Israel would not object to international supervision of a peace agreement. There has also been, in the 10 days since Mr Arafat and Mr Barak met President Clinton separately in Washington, renewed speculation about a final peace summit before Mr Clinton leaves office. To Fatah leaders there is no contradiction between the intifada, and negotiations. They argue that the two go together, while Fatah's presence on the ground helps to repair the gross inequality between the Palestinians and Israel's political, economic and military strength. To Mr Barak that is simply unacceptable, running counter to the mantra that the Palestinians must \"stop the violence\" before there can be talks. He is under constant pressure from the Israeli right and the army to strike ever harder against the Palestinians. But the Israeli left is also beginning to awake from its slumber. Two dozen prominent writers and academics published a large newspaper ad yesterday calling on Mr Barak to disband Jewish settlements in the West Bank and affirming support for a Palestinian state. Earlier this week Israeli non-governmental organisations resumed contacts with their Palestinian counterparts, broken off when the violence erupted. Opinion poll results published yesterday showed that the steep decline in popular support for Mr Barak could be reversed if he reaches a final peace settlement with the Palestinians. The findings are the first to challenge the accepted wisdom in Israel that Mr Barak would be forced out if he resumed negotiations. For now, however, \"there is total confusion in the Israeli government, it is like pilot's vertigo\", said Menachem Friedman, an academic who was among the ads' signatories. \"The leadership is embarrassed and needs reorientation to find out where the skyline is, and where to move the aircraft. \"They move from one extreme to the other, not satisfying anyone, neither the peace camp, nor the right wing.\"",

Judge Terry Lewis's ruling had sent the Bush campaign officials in Austin cheering and hugging one another and Gore supporters looking gloomier than they had been all week. The counting of Florida's estimated 2,500 overseas postal votes was due to begin at midnight last night, the final deadline for them to be received by the state's 67 counties. Results from these counts - generally assumed likely to produce a Republican majority - are expected to be tabulated by midday and to be added to the existing statewide figures, which show Mr Bush with a 300-vote lead in an electorate of 6m voters. By noon yesterday, two of the 67 counties had already reported their overseas ballot results, which gave a net gain of two votes to Mr Bush. There were more overseas ballots left to count in pro-Bush counties such as Duval (with 500 uncounted yesterday) and Escambia (239) than in pro-Gore counties such as Palm Beach (44) and Broward (100).

The party's evidently confident election planners will also deploy a strong emphasis on crime prevention - including a \"yob bill\" in the Queen's Speech - investment in public services and a balance of rights and responsibilities which citizens should honour. But much of Labour's energies will be directed at William Hague in person - the Tories' biggest problem, pollsters claim - and the continuing reluctance of voters to trust him or his lieutenants, whose best hope is a \"backdoor strategy\" for victory via public disillusionment and cynicism. Labour has been hit by polling setbacks since the fuel protests, as party planners admit. But they are brushing aside shadow ministers' claims that they have lost fundamental public confidence. \"It would be fair to admit that people are impatient for change. They want more change and they want it faster,\" Tony Blair's spokesman admitted last night. But, far from being on the backfoot, the government may be the first in 100 years to win a second term because the voters, whatever their impatience, trust Labour with the economy better than they do the Tory alternative. \"Voters have a very clear memory of the Tory legacy, the railways, BSE, negative equity, boom and bust,\" an insider said. It reinforces the Labour message that voters agree that Britain is not so much an overtaxed country as an underinvested one. That memory, coupled with what is likely to be Labour's ruthless use of the Tory \"\u00a316bn black hole\" on tax-and-spending plans, will assure victory in what Downing Street refuses to say will be a May 3 or 10 election. Yesterday's upbeat scenario given to Mr Blair and his senior colleagues came from focus group and polling data provided by Labour party HQ and the pollster Philip Gould, which - if upheld by a second full term - will vindicate Mr Blair's long-term aim to make the centre left the natural party of government. \"There was a lengthy discussion about this whole problem of cynicism, that what the prime minister feels about this is that the Conservatives do not feel confident enough to put up the people they have in the leadership of the Conservative party and say 'this is what you want as the next government'.

As a civil servant, albeit with a special politicised contract, Mr Campbell will have to resign when the election is called - to help Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson mastermind the Labour campaign. Last night he stressed the importance of addressing manifestations of yob culture - drunkenness, graffiti, intimidation on the streets.

      "bodyText": "The families of two French victims of CJD, the fatal human variant of mad cow disease or BSE, filed a lawsuit in Paris yesterday against French, British and European authorities, alleging poisoning and involuntary manslaughter. As Italy announced a partial ban on French beef, the parents of Laurence Duhamel, 39, who died of new variant CJD in February, and Arnaud Eboli, 19, a suspected sufferer, said Britain, France and the EU had failed to adequately protect their citizens. \"People who smoke and drink do so by their own choice. All my son did was eat meat, and he is going to die,\" said Dominique Eboli outside the court. \"What we want now is for measures to prevent this from happening again.\" The 100-page suit, the first of its kind related to CJD in France, was lodged \"against persons unknown\", a legal procedure that requires judicial experts to establish whether there is a case to answer, and if so, who should appear in court as defendants. Lawyers said Britain was targeted because of claims that it had effectively exported BSE, and hence nvCJD, to France. French farmers claim at least 14,000 tonnes of meat-and-bone meal banned in Britain were imported into France in the early 1990s. A spokesman for Tony Blair said there had been no formal notification of any action against the government. The French government this week banned T-bone steak and other cuts of beef on the bone, and suspended the use of meat-and-bone meal in all animal feed. Sales have fallen 40% since three supermarket chains admitted last month that they had unknowingly sold potentially contaminated beef. A hospital in Paris said yesterday that it had detected a fourth possible CJD case, a woman of 40. At least 80 cases have been diagnosed in Britain. Three French ministers stood trial last year after allowing the transfusion service to use blood that eventually infected some 4,000 people with HIV.",

Moving as silently as possible they and the eight men who accompanied them climbed over a barbed wire fence and made their way along a crumbling stone wall towards what looked like a pile of discarded red bricks.</p> <p>Bending down to remove two sheets of rusting corrugated iron, the first man eased himself through a hole he had uncovered in the ground. He was followed by the rest of the group, and within minutes there was no visible sign of life above the surface.</p> <p>For the two boys from Dublin, aged 14 and 16, it was their first visit to a paramilitary training camp; but the path they trod that day in October last year was one that has been followed by hundreds, if not thousands, of young Irishmen from both sides of the political divide over the last 30 years as they took their first steps into the murky world of the terrorist.</p> <p>Despite being in one of the more remote spots in rural Ireland, the group was not alone that night in the fields sur rounding Herbertstown House, a once grand dwelling for minor aristocracy that has been reduced to a few stone walls and a couple of cowsheds on the border between County Dublin and County Meath. A squad from the Garda's elite emergency response unit (ERU), the Irish republic's version of the SAS, had been staking out the underground bunker in the derelict wine cellar of the old mansion.</p> <p>According to evidence given at the trial of John McDonaugh, 34, who pleaded guilty this year to training with and possessing weapons at a Real IRA training camp, he had collected five young men outside a McDonald's restaurant in Dublin. The 14-year-old told police that he had been approached two days before his arrest at the training camp and told he would learn about Irish history, be shown guns and be allowed to fire blanks. The 17-year-old explained to Garda officers that he had been approached and told he was going to an Oglaigh na hEireann training camp. He said he knew a splinter group was involved but did not know it was the Real IRA.</p> <p>The boys were taken to a farm in Drogheda in a van. From there they had been transferred to a jeep and a horsebox which brought them to within walking distance of Herbertstown House.</p> <p>At 9.30pm, as McDonaugh stood guard outside, the ERU decided to move in. Wearing black boiler suits, bullet-proof vests and masks, and carrying pump-action shotguns, Uzi machine pistols and smoke grenades, the officers surrounded the entrance to the cellar and arrested McDonaugh. Two men tried to escape but were arrested by police. A smoke grenade was thrown inside and the remaining suspects gave themselves up.</p> <p>According to previous court hearings, when the police entered the cellar, which was lit by a portable generator, they found a Zastava 7.62mm assault rifle, a CZ model 70.9mm pistol, a CZ model 9mm submachine gun and three magazines. Police also found sandbags that contained bullets matching the pistol.</p> <p>One of the older men, according to a statement read out in court, was wearing a white boiler suit and gloves and had been giving a demonstration in how to strip down, re-assemble and fire the weapons.</p> <p>In follow-up searches of the area, police found bomb components including detonators, and a RPG 18mm rocket launcher, with an explosive warhead capable of piercing armour. The weapon had never been seen in the Irish republic before. Nobody has been charged over the later find, but it signalled a worrying development for the security forces on both sides of the border. The weapons, which are believed to have come from a senior Croatian army officer who has been cited as a war criminal by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, showed the Real IRA had set up a supply line to some serious weaponry.</p> <p>But equally worrying to the security forces was the age of two of the recruits who were being trained at the camp. The 14-year-old schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was led crying and shaking from the bunker. \"Emotionally overcome,\" was how one special branch officer described it in court.</p> <p>This month the youth, now 16, was given a three-year suspended sentence at the special criminal court in Dublin after pleading guilty to offences connected with the discovery of the training camp.</p> <p>At the same hearing, sentencing was adjourned on his friend, who was 16 at the time of his arrest. He was ordered to sign on three times a week at Coolock Garda station after detectives giving evidence said the youth still had very strong leanings towards extremist republican organisations and had been seen in the company of leading dissidents since his arrest.</p> <p>The Real IRA is the largest in a coalition of dissident groups, which, security services estimate, number between 120 and 200 people, although it is unclear how many are \"active\" terrorists. It formed in the autumn of 1997 when the IRA's quartermaster quit the IRA with his partner and a dozen others. But since then the group has failed to attract the number of disaffected provisionals it had hoped, apart from a senior bomb maker who defected to the Real IRA in May last year.</p> <p>Although many who took part in the Provisional IRA's terror campaigns may be broadly in agreement with the Real IRA's aims to fight on, the Omagh atrocity, when 29 people and unborn twins died after a car bomb exploded in the centre on a busy Saturday afternoon in Co Tyrone town in October 1998, has resulted in many steering clear of the dissident organisation.</p> <p>Fears of a feud between the rival republican groups has also hardened positions. Last month Joe O'Connor, the Belfast Commander of the Real IRA, was shot seven times in the head outside his home in Ballymurphy. It was the most serious of several clashes between the two groups.</p> <p>As a result, the Real IRA has been forced to look elsewhere to try to bolster its membership and carry out attacks. In the spring, security forces in the Republic questioned members of a Real IRA colour party near the border. \"They were people we've never seen before, they were very young, little more than kids,\" a senior security source was quoted as saying in the magazine Magill.</p> <p>According to Professor Paul Wilkinson at the centre for the study of terrorism and political violence at St Andrew's University, such recruits are known as \"lilywhites\" because they have unblemished records. \"They have no record with the Garda or any other security services, and are therefore less likely to be observed. Dublin is particularly attractive for this type of recruitment, as security is likely to be less tight than in the north,\" he said.</p> <p>The two teenagers arrested at the Real IRA training camp fit the profile perfectly. The family of the 14-year-old had no known republican connections, although he joined the Fianna - which has been described as a republican version of the scouts - at the age of 12. The older teenager had a similarly unblemished record.</p> <p>For the Real IRA the use of \"cleanskins\" - as they are known by the intelligence services - has become increasingly important as the security net has tightened around many of the dissident organisation's more established figures. \"There has been an emergence of a policy to use clean operatives which does make the work more difficult,\" said one security source. \"These clean volunteers have to be identified before they can be watched.\"</p> <p>The tactic was illustrated in May last year when three members of the Real IRA were jailed for planning a firebombing campaign in London. Anthony Hyland, took a four-year arts degree at University College Dublin, Liam Grogan had just graduated from the same university where he had met Hyland, while the third member of the group, Darren Mulholland, was in the second year of a theoretical physics degree at Queens university, Belfast.</p> <p>The trio, who were arrested in July 1998 following a surveillance operation mounted by the Garda, MI5 and the Metropolitan Police, planned to target a senior politician with 2lb of Semtex and to bomb shops in London before escaping to Ireland. Significantly, the men had not been involved in terrorism before. At their trial, police were unclear whether they had instigated the bombing plan or were acting as agents for more experienced members of the Real IRA. The fact that all three were either students or former students is also significant, as the security services also have evidence of attempts to set up cells within universities and among students in both the north and the south.</p> <p>Intelligence has suggested the Real IRA is planning a \"spectacular\" over the Christmas period, with London being the most likely target.

Ten orthopaedic consultants at the Queen Alexandra hospital say the lack of sterile instruments means that they consider it is becoming more dangerous to continue the operations on accident victims than to send them to other centres in the south of England. Contingency plans are being prepared to send emergency cases to other hospitals in Winchester, Southampton or Chichester. Routine orthopaedic surgery was suspended in September because of long-standing problems in the hospital's sterilisation and disinfection unit so that there would at least be sufficient sterile equipment to deal with trauma patients. The Department of Health called the situation at the hospital \"completely unacceptable\" and threatened either to send in a hit squad or introduce controls over its funding decisions. The Cosham area hospital has the biggest accident and emergency unit in the south with a catchment area covering 600,000 people. This crisis follows reports this week which have criticised the running of the Oxford heart centre, condemned the treatment of elderly mental patients in Carlisle and warned of risk to patients from the failure to share procedures in two hospitals' operating theatres run by the Carmarthenshire health trust. The Portsmouth problems were revealed in a letter written by the surgeons on Monday to hospital management recommending that all admission of trauma victims should cease from November 27, by which time neighbouring units should be prepared to take extra patients. It said: \"Despite stopping elective surgery we have not seen any improvement in the supply of sterile instruments for trauma. Indeed the situation has become worse. We have previously taken the view that cancellation of trauma takes would put the patients at greater risk than continuing the service.\" But the doctors said the situation had changed in the previous two weeks and \"we now feel that patients' lives and well-being are at serious risk and this situation cannot be allowed to continue\". It is understood that last week staff took six hours to find suitable equipment to treat an elderly woman with a multiple fracture to her leg that needed surgery. Consultants might also have to reduce or stop seeing new patients. The surgeons' letter said they were \"extremely disappointed\" that concerns first raised in June had not been addressed. \"Our decision has not been taken lightly ... Morale in the orthopaedic department is at an all-time low.\" The Portsmouth Hospitals Trust acknowledged \"very slow progress\" in addressing problems but said it was \"working very hard to ensure that orthopaedic surgery continues at the Queen Alexandra Hospital.\" More instruments had been ordered. The suspension of elective surgery meant that about 200 operations were cancelled or postponed but some operations have been conducted since early this month at the military Royal Hospital, Haslar, in Gosport. Michael Mates, Conservative MP for Hampshire East, said he had raised concerns with health minister Gisela Stuart on three occasions in the last two months. The health department said: \"The hospital should not have let this situation develop. We expect them to take very swift action to sort out their sterilisation department, to make sure patients are safe and to deal with those who have had to wait for their operations.

In a statement, the Riyadh police chief, Abdullah al-Shahrani, said the car, thought to have been booby-trapped, exploded while it was being driven. Other Saudi sources said earlier that explosives had been thrown through the window of the car. A Foreign Office spokeswoman in London said she could not confirm the cause of the blast. The dead Briton was named as Christopher Rodway. His wife Jane, who was in the car with him, was treated at Al-Hammadi hospital for superficial injuries. The Foreign Office said the couple had been living in Saudi Arabia for six or seven years and that Mr Rodway worked in a hospital in Riyadh. Security forces sealed off two main streets in the Saudi capital's commercial district where the blast occurred before removing the four-wheel-drive vehicle. The attack came immediately after Friday prayers and a few hours before Crown Prince Abdullah was due to open an international energy conference in the city attended by officials from more than 40 oil producing and consuming countries. Last August, a Briton was injured when a man opened fire on two cars carrying employees of BAE Systems, which provides support services for the King Faisal air base. That attack was said not to have been politically motivated. Current Foreign Office advice is that \"Saudi Arabia is one of a number of countries where there is an increased threat to British interests from global terrorism\". Britons should \"exercise particular caution\", it says. Between 25,000 and 30,000 Britons work in the kingdom.

Just a month ago, only 191 of the six-page forms had been returned.</p> <p>The applications are in response to Tony Blair's decision to find a new way of appointing peers in the wake of accusations that the House had been stuffed with \"Tony's cronies\" since the ejection of hereditary peers. Lord Stevenson, the media tycoon, has been asked to vet applications and propose up to 10 \"ordinary peers\". The Tories are curious but sceptical about the exercise. \"I can't believe they'll find 10 suitable people,\" one said yesterday.</p> <p>To illustrate the dangers, it emerged that one applicant is Peter Hitchens, the former Trotskyite activist who is now a militant Conservative and columnist on the Daily Express. Other applicants were said to be more earnest.</p> <p>The recruitment drive - which saw late applications arriving by hand or via the internet - is also part of Labour's campaign to modernise the second chamber by including more women and people from ethnic minority groups, both categories woefully under-represented in parliament, and, in particular, the Lords. Any UK or Commonwealth citizen over 21 can apply for one of the eight to 10 places which will be announced early next year.</p> <p>Former convicts will not be ruled out - but, to be in with a chance, applicants will have to prove their \"independence and personal integrity, highest standards of propriety, and their ability to contribute to the work of the House\".

      "bodyText": "A last-minute deluge of wannabe peers emerged yesterday as candidates rushed to become the newest recruits in the House of Lords - with up to 400 applying in the 24 hours before the midnight deadline. The phone lines to the Lords were white hot as would-be \"people's peers\" suddenly realised they could make a difference or, at least, gain a title. A fifth of all the 2,000 applications arrived yesterday - while 700 have come in since Monday alone. Just a month ago, only 191 of the six-page forms had been returned. The applications are in response to Tony Blair's decision to find a new way of appointing peers in the wake of accusations that the House had been stuffed with \"Tony's cronies\" since the ejection of hereditary peers. Lord Stevenson, the media tycoon, has been asked to vet applications and propose up to 10 \"ordinary peers\". The Tories are curious but sceptical about the exercise. \"I can't believe they'll find 10 suitable people,\" one said yesterday. To illustrate the dangers, it emerged that one applicant is Peter Hitchens, the former Trotskyite activist who is now a militant Conservative and columnist on the Daily Express. Other applicants were said to be more earnest. The recruitment drive - which saw late applications arriving by hand or via the internet - is also part of Labour's campaign to modernise the second chamber by including more women and people from ethnic minority groups, both categories woefully under-represented in parliament, and, in particular, the Lords. Any UK or Commonwealth citizen over 21 can apply for one of the eight to 10 places which will be announced early next year. Former convicts will not be ruled out - but, to be in with a chance, applicants will have to prove their \"independence and personal integrity, highest standards of propriety, and their ability to contribute to the work of the House\". They will also be expected to demonstrate that they possess seven qualities perceived as essential for a peer: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. With just six hours to go before the deadline, a spokeswoman for the appointments commission refused to reveal any details of who had applied, though, in addition to Mr Hitchens, candidates are believed to include a 25-year-old basketball player and a 78-year-old retired agricultural scientist from Sussex. There has been further speculation that candidates include Oxford University academics and a former firearms officer at Buckingham palace. To encourage applicants from all areas, 10,000 letters were sent to companies, charities, businesses and trade unions asking for nominations. But the final rush for posts first advertised eight weeks ago is believed to have been sparked by a broadcast on the BBC's Breakfast News yesterday morning. \"We've had hundreds come in in the last few days, but a sudden rush after that,\" added the spokeswoman. The successful applicants - who will gain a title, an allowance of \u00a381.50 a day and benefit from subsidised restaurants and bars, exquisite surroundings and erudite company - are expected to be announced by March after a \"stringent\" vetting process. They will also enjoy all the trappings of power together with the kudos of having reached the elevated position of member of the House of Lords through their own merits rather than ancestors' aristocratic blood. The successful applicants, who will be non-political and sit on the crossbenches, will join a House that is becoming increasingly assertive, with members defeating the government on two important issues - the lowering of the gay age of consent and the sale of air traffic control - in the last three weeks. Principles for holders of public office Selflessness They should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends. Integrity They should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might seek to influence them in the performance of their official duties. Objectivity In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for awards and benefits, they should make choices on merit. Accountability They are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public, and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office. Openness They should be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions they take. They should give reasons for their decisions, and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands. Honesty They should have a duty to declare any private interests relating to their public duties, and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way that protects the public interest. Leadership They should promote and support these principles by leadership and example.",

      "body": "<p>Gerald Corbett's departure is a new start for an organisation that over the past year has earned the sobriquet of Britain's most hated company.</p> <p>His replacement as Railtrack's chief executive is Steven Marshall, an accountant who worked alongside Mr Corbett five years ago at the Grand Metropolitan pubs and drinks group. But he has a quieter, more measured style than his predecessor, who was a tough and occasionally abrasive leader.</p> <p>When Mr Corbett first tendered his resignation last month, in the wake of the Hatfield crash, there was a widespread feeling he ought to stay on. By yesterday, with the network still suffering appallingly from cancellations, delays and speed restrictions, there were suggestions that some of the more influential voices in the industry believed he was not really the man for the job.</p> <p>A source inside one of the regulators said: \"We all admired Gerald after Ladbroke Grove. He took a lot of responsibility, and that took a lot of courage. But there is a view the business needs to do better in its day-to-day running. Someone has got to get a grip. We need a new approach, a new team and a new start.\"</p> <p>In just the last week Mr Corbett is viewed as having made two serious misjudgments. The first was when he compared the pursuit of rail safety to a journey in which \"you never arrive at your destination\". This tactless comment at Lord Cullen's inquiry into the Paddington disaster drew tears from some relatives of the 31 dead in the public gallery, and Mr Corbett apologised.</p> <p>Three days later he provoked fury by raising the company's dividend to shareholders. He said the increase, which will siphon off \u00a32m that Railtrack might have used for investment, was a signal to investors of better times ahead.</p> <p>A spokesman for Railtrack denied Mr Corbett had been put under any pressure to resign, either by the government or by Railtrack's chairman, Sir Philip Beck. \"It really was a purely personal decision,\" he said. But the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, had repeatedly declined to give Mr Corbett his personal support, saying only: \"I have full confidence in the company and I want them to get on with the job.\"</p> <p>Last night the prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, insisted the government had had no idea Mr Corbett was about to resign - even though on Thursday he had been inside Downing Street to present his national recovery plan.

      "bodyText": "Gerald Corbett's departure is a new start for an organisation that over the past year has earned the sobriquet of Britain's most hated company. His replacement as Railtrack's chief executive is Steven Marshall, an accountant who worked alongside Mr Corbett five years ago at the Grand Metropolitan pubs and drinks group. But he has a quieter, more measured style than his predecessor, who was a tough and occasionally abrasive leader. When Mr Corbett first tendered his resignation last month, in the wake of the Hatfield crash, there was a widespread feeling he ought to stay on. By yesterday, with the network still suffering appallingly from cancellations, delays and speed restrictions, there were suggestions that some of the more influential voices in the industry believed he was not really the man for the job. A source inside one of the regulators said: \"We all admired Gerald after Ladbroke Grove. He took a lot of responsibility, and that took a lot of courage. But there is a view the business needs to do better in its day-to-day running. Someone has got to get a grip. We need a new approach, a new team and a new start.\" In just the last week Mr Corbett is viewed as having made two serious misjudgments. The first was when he compared the pursuit of rail safety to a journey in which \"you never arrive at your destination\". This tactless comment at Lord Cullen's inquiry into the Paddington disaster drew tears from some relatives of the 31 dead in the public gallery, and Mr Corbett apologised. Three days later he provoked fury by raising the company's dividend to shareholders. He said the increase, which will siphon off \u00a32m that Railtrack might have used for investment, was a signal to investors of better times ahead. A spokesman for Railtrack denied Mr Corbett had been put under any pressure to resign, either by the government or by Railtrack's chairman, Sir Philip Beck. \"It really was a purely personal decision,\" he said. But the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, had repeatedly declined to give Mr Corbett his personal support, saying only: \"I have full confidence in the company and I want them to get on with the job.\" Last night the prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, insisted the government had had no idea Mr Corbett was about to resign - even though on Thursday he had been inside Downing Street to present his national recovery plan. But Mr Campbell admitted: \"We are on their backs pretty permanently at the moment.\" Now he has time, Mr Corbett plans a long holiday in India and a skiing trip over Christmas. In his absence his successor will take up one of the toughest jobs in business. Mr Marshall's first priority will be to get the network out of chaos by ensuring the present spate of work on the track is done on time. About 75 miles have been relaid, but many more remain and passengers are facing delays well into the new year. He must focus on the issue of signals passed at danger, or Spads, primary cause of the Paddington disaster. He faces tough negotiations with the train operating companies over compensation for the current delays. Railtrack has offered \u00a3150m, but the operators are believed to want at least double so they can offer generous terms to delayed customers; however, a big payout would anger Railtrack shareholders. He also faces the prospect of a highly critical report from Lord Cullen, and probably a second one arising from the Hatfield enquiry. And he will not have support from all quarters. Supporters will point to his having overseen a huge \u00a32bn investment in the railways over the past year; detractors will focus on the fact that, like his predecessor, he is not a railman but an accountant. Relaxed style for decidedly tough job Steven Marshall will bring his own \"unassuming and relaxed\" style to the toughest corporate job in the country, his former colleagues said yesterday. Mr Marshall, 43, may be a relative newcomer to the rail industry, but his new job will not be the first time he has taken the helm in the middle of a corporate storm. At Thorn, the electrical and TV rental company, he was called upon to make a similar move from financial director to chief executive in 1995 when it was demerged from EMI. Mr Marshall has been groomed to be Gerald Corbett's successor, and presents himself as the passengers' friend. Yesterday he said that he intended to examine Railtrack's whole agenda, to ensure that more emphasis was put on consumer benefits. But whether Mr Marshall will be able to keep a cool head in his new position remains to be seen. \"I have not seen him work in areas where there are political or diplomatic considerations - something he will have a lot of at Railtrack,\" a friend said.",

The government will provide \u00a389m in capital grants for offshore wind and energy crops. There will also be a boost of combined heat and power with district and factory heating schemes. </p> <p>New regulations to make electrical goods more efficient are already in place and revised building rules will improve insulation in homes. Businesses will pay a climate change levy on carbon based fuels and \u00a3130m of that money will be recycled into low carbon technologies to stimulate their growth. </p> <p>From next year electricity companies will be obliged to help pensioners and the poor insulate homes to reduce their power bills. </p> <p>One of the most controversial aspects of the UK's policy is transport - where energy-efficient engines and cleaner technologies are voluntary agreements. There is also criticism from the green lobby of the lowering of petrol taxes and of a report yesterday that the ultra low sulphur diesel produces 20% more carbon dioxide than ordinary fuel. </p> <p>Mr Meacher said that the price of oil had soared so much that the tax cut made no difference to the fuel strategy. He also refuted claims that the new diesel was more polluting. It produced far less particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, two serious air pollutants. As far as carbon dioxide was concerned the increase was about 2% per gallon but this was offset by the fact it was a lighter fuel and contained less carbon that ordinary diesel. </p> <p>The new Traffic Act would also give local authorities the power to curb traffic with road pricing. \"If the strategy is not enough to curb traffic we will take further measures,\" Mr Meacher said. </p> <p>Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"There are too many voluntary measures and not enough mandatory ones. There should be tax breaks for industry to bring in low carbon or no carbon fuels and much more support for renewables.\" </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.unfccc.int\">UN framework convention on climate change</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.unfccc.de/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html\">Full text of the Kyoto Protocol</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.environment.detr.gov.uk/climatechange\">DETR climate change programme</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk\">University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit</a> </p> <p><strong>Lifestyle changes in the UK by 2010 </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Houses will be better insulated and energy rated, so fuel bills will go down </p> <p>\u2022 Electrical goods will be energy efficient </p> <p>\u2022 Park and ride schemes will be common, as city roads are given tolls </p> <p>\u2022 Public transport will be better in town and country </p> <p>\u2022 Trains may run on time. </p> <p>\u2022 Cars will be smaller and more fuel efficient </p> <p>\u2022 Many cars will run on clean fuels </p> <p>\u2022 Rubbish will be recycled </p> <p>\u2022 Wellington boots will be more than a fashion item </p> <p>\u2022 Solar panels will be available in supermarkets</p>",

The US is committed to 7% cuts but, because of a booming economy, says it cannot reach the target by cutting fossil fuel burning and instead must buy carbon credits from other countries and plant forests. Mr Meacher said the EU remained determined that the US must take domestic action and not buy its way out of its commitments. \"The extreme weather of the last few weeks...can leave us in no doubt of the urgency of tack- ling global warming,\" he said. \"The US with 5% of the world population and 25% of emissions must be brought on board.\" The UK programme is already well ahead of most countries because it substitutes gas-fired electricity stations for coal but Mr Meacher said the cuts being made in emissions in the next 10 years were \"real\". Among the carbon savings is an increase in renewable energies from 1% to 10% of electricity production including wind power, wood and bio-fuelled power stations, wave energy and solar power. The government will provide \u00a389m in capital grants for offshore wind and energy crops. There will also be a boost of combined heat and power with district and factory heating schemes. New regulations to make electrical goods more efficient are already in place and revised building rules will improve insulation in homes. Businesses will pay a climate change levy on carbon based fuels and \u00a3130m of that money will be recycled into low carbon technologies to stimulate their growth. From next year electricity companies will be obliged to help pensioners and the poor insulate homes to reduce their power bills. One of the most controversial aspects of the UK's policy is transport - where energy-efficient engines and cleaner technologies are voluntary agreements. There is also criticism from the green lobby of the lowering of petrol taxes and of a report yesterday that the ultra low sulphur diesel produces 20% more carbon dioxide than ordinary fuel. Mr Meacher said that the price of oil had soared so much that the tax cut made no difference to the fuel strategy. He also refuted claims that the new diesel was more polluting. It produced far less particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, two serious air pollutants. As far as carbon dioxide was concerned the increase was about 2% per gallon but this was offset by the fact it was a lighter fuel and contained less carbon that ordinary diesel. The new Traffic Act would also give local authorities the power to curb traffic with road pricing. \"If the strategy is not enough to curb traffic we will take further measures,\" Mr Meacher said. Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"There are too many voluntary measures and not enough mandatory ones. There should be tax breaks for industry to bring in low carbon or no carbon fuels and much more support for renewables.\" Useful links UN framework convention on climate change Full text of the Kyoto Protocol DETR climate change programme University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit Lifestyle changes in the UK by 2010 \u2022 Houses will be better insulated and energy rated, so fuel bills will go down \u2022 Electrical goods will be energy efficient \u2022 Park and ride schemes will be common, as city roads are given tolls \u2022 Public transport will be better in town and country \u2022 Trains may run on time. \u2022 Cars will be smaller and more fuel efficient \u2022 Many cars will run on clean fuels \u2022 Rubbish will be recycled \u2022 Wellington boots will be more than a fashion item \u2022 Solar panels will be available in supermarkets",

      "body": "<p><strong> November 5 1999</strong><br> </p> <p>New York. To the Public Theater to interview George Wolfe, who is its director. He had to follow Joe Papp - a producer with a gargantuan enthusiasm for not-for-profit theatre and a matching ego: he substituted his own face for Shakespeare's on the posters for Shakespeare in the Park. George, despite a kidney transplant and running the Public Theater, has limitless energy and has discovered the secret of circular breathing: he talks without stopping about social responsibility, the Group Theater, Odets, Miller, Federal Theater Project and - he's black - racism, the fault-line in American society. We talk about \"cultural strip-mining\": \"I think that there are very few things that happen in this country that I don't see as some kind of Minstrel show,\" says George. </p> <p><strong> November 6 </strong> <br></p> <p>Interview with Kim Hunter, the original Stella in the play and movie of Streetcar. She talks of Marlon Brando with great affection as a thoughtful, responsible, hard-working and thoroughly engaged actor. When we asked him if he'd be interviewed for this series, he said that the last thing in the world he wanted to talk about was acting; he'd only talk about the plight of the American Indian. Reasonable enough, but Stan, our van driver, says of him: \"His elevator doesn't go to the top.\" </p> <p>Broadway by night: a piece to camera about what the American theatre has given to the British. When we finish filming, three small girls ask for my autograph. I tell them that my signature is worthless, but they meekly persist: the presence of the camera has convinced them that I'm a catch, so strong is the national religion of celebrity. So I write: \"Kira, with best wishes\", wishing that I could make her day by adding the words \"Clint\" and \"Eastwood\". </p> <p><strong> November 7 </strong></p> <p> Irene Worth interview, then off to New Orleans. Irene talks (and does impersonations) of No\u00ebl Coward, TS Eliot and John Gielgud, from whom she says she had the best piece of advice on acting, which he'd learned painfully: \"Acting is half shame, half glory. Shame when you're aware of yourself, and glory when you can forget yourself.\" </p> <p>It's a two-hour journey (and a different time zone) to New Orleans. We arrive after dark, happy to be wrapped in humid, semi-tropical night. We're staying in the French Quarter - elegant two - or three-storey houses, a louche and lively street life, live oaks dripping with Spanish moss in the square, small courtyards with fountains and greenery, and balconies with lacy ironwork. We have dinner sitting on one of them, directly opposite the room where Tennessee Williams lived - the justification for our visit. </p> <p><strong> November 8 </strong> <br></p> <p>Driving out of town to rendezvous with a steamboat (as in Showboat, the first real Broadway musical). I grew up in Hardy country in Dorset, so I'm used to people decoding landscape familiar to them from literature. For me, Louisiana is familiar from Huckleberry Finn, the plays of Tennessee Williams, the novels of James Lee Burke, and the life of Huey Long, the demagogue governor, assassinated in 1935, chronicled brilliantly in Robert Penn Warren's All The King's Men. I tell Warren, our New Orleans van driver, about my interest in Huey Long. \"He was a big BS-er,\" he says. </p> <p>The steamboat - the American Queen - is moored on the Mississippi beside a levee, the steep man-made flood-barriers that line the river. The scale of the boat matches the river: it's like a white Gothic aircraft carrier with a huge red paddle wheel at its stern, a floating hotel. </p> <p>Opposite the levee is a beautiful white-columned \"Greek revival\" house, situated at the end of an arcade of 250-year-old live oaks, surrounded - at a distance - by sugar fields and small thin- roofed clap-board houses. It doesn't take much imagination to picture the slave plantation, and we're reminded that the Old South isn't dead when our camera assistant, Andy, who is part Malaysian, asks a tourist if he minds waiting till we've finished the shot. \"Move, Boy!\" shouts the no-neck. Later I spot Little Black Sambo for sale in the tourist shop. </p> <p><strong> November 9 </strong><br> </p> <p>The French Quarter is swarming with tourists, the objects of veneration being the ubiquitous T-shirt, Tabasco, souvenirs and cajun music CDs. In contrast, the Louisiana museum is almost empty; it's next to the St Louis cathedral, whose bells Blanche Dubois refers to as the only pure thing in New Orleans. Just to see the chronicle of slavery, the forced migration, the auctions, the division of families, the systematised brutality, is to feel that here is a crime as great as the Holocaust, and possibly less well digested by the perpetrators and the victims. </p> <p>Plaques all over the French Quarter describie the dates of houses and their ownership. There is nothing, however, to record the residence of Tennessee Williams, who put New Orleans on the map as much as Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet did. At night we film on the balcony where we had dinner two nights ago, opposite the house where Williams worked on a play set in Chicago called The Poker Night, as the streetcars rattled below his window. They came from a district called Cemetery and ended in Desire: the setting of his play became New Orleans - a street called Elysian Fields (it exists but not in the French Quarter) - and the streetcar became celebrated in its title. </p> <p>Later we film on a streetcar (well, a bus) heading for Desire. It seems a cruel irony for its inhabitants that Desire is all embers rather than all promise. It's the end of the line: shacks, tenements, urban wasteland, the expense of spirit in a waste of shame. We spend two hours filming on the bus - Desire twice consummated - and feel that segregation, at least by poverty, still persists: we're the only white people who travel on the bus. </p> <p> \u0095 Richard Eyre's Changing Stages continues on BBC2 on Sunday at 7.30pm.</p>",

Strawberry blonde tresses dancing in the breeze, Charlie wouldn't look out of place wandering about the woods in A Midsummer Night's Dream. </p> <p>As it was, she was in the back garden of a cottage in Ross-on-Wye creating a meadow garden for some woman who couldn't be bothered doing it herself. Instead of getting on and doing the job - and thus producing a neat 15-minute programme - Charlie and Chris had a whole half-hour to fill. That meant padding out the digging and planting with some day trips away. </p> <p>Consequently, Charlie nipped off to another garden that had flowers (oooh!) and to a genuine meadow with Nick the wildlife expert (aaah!). And some expert Nick was. When the pair saw a creepy spider carrying its babies in a sac under its body, instead of stamping on it and laughing, Nick picked it up and called it \"special\". It would be even more \"special\", he continued, when the sac burst open and the babies rode around on mummy spider's back. Special?

Cuddling grasshoppers I can just about deal with, but spiders are just plain wrong. </p> <p>Back in the garden, after an interlude devoted entirely to reminding us how pretty butterflies are, Charlie was whooping enthusiastically: \"I've got a red admiral on my bum.\" Where the rest of the fleet were, we weren't told (though they may have been forming an orderly queue somewhere). Naturally, no Dimmock programme would be complete without a little sexual frisson - and we were treated to it in spades as she and Chris the Mad Meadows Man threw grass at each other in a devil-may-care rural style. </p> <p>Charlie Dimmock isn't a real person, of course. She's actually a robot created by some shadowy military-industrial-gardening organisation to encourage us to get on with horticultural shenanigans while they spray us with sedatives from weather balloons.

      "body": "<p>There's a lot of art about at the moment. It's everywhere. It's really stressing me out. It's making me feel guilty. And I wish it would stop. For starters, there's all those books on the Booker shortlist. I ought to read them. Well, at least the Margaret Atwood. But if I read that one, I know I'll want to read more Atwood. I mean, I haven't even read The Handmaid's Tale, and everybody's read that. And there's a film of it that I ought to see, a TV adaptation I missed, and a fantastic opera version that opened in Copenhagen last year. </p> <p>And there's all those exhibitions. I want to have an opinion about Apocalypse. I mean, I've got an opinion because I've seen countless pieces in newspapers and magazines. I've witnessed Tracey Emin being repellent in various media. But I'd like to see the real thing at some point so that I don't go round feeling my opinion is a bit... well, second-hand. And that library in Peckham - that sounds fascinating. I need to work out where Peckham is, find the library, and see what I think of it for myself. </p> <p>And I've got to stop being so metropolitan. I've got to go to the Lowry Centre, the Tate in... oh God, is it Cornwall or Devon or...? And Smoking with Lulu at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. I would say that's a must-see. </p> <p>It's not just art I want to be aware of. There's culture, too. I mean, I'm not an elitist. I understand that the new Charlie's Angels movie embraces a fascinating range of discourses on gender politics. Can this really be true? I have to see it for myself. And I have to compare and contrast the new Westlife single and the new Tweenies single and... </p> <p>Look. Isn't there too much art around at the moment? Isn't there too much culture? Isn't it making us all unhappy? Clearly there's a big problem. And we've got to find a solution. </p> <p>Various moratoria have been suggested recently: no more Shakespeare plays produced for five years; nothing but new plays produced for 10 years. Well, I wonder whether we shouldn't go for the big one: nothing produced for a year. No images, no narratives, no \"experiences\", no performances. Nothing that could be considered, even by the most dogged commentator, as art or culture. Just a year to give us a chance to calm down, take stock and see whether we really want all this stuff. </p> <p>All of this would have to be firmly managed, of course. A cultural moratorium tsar would have to be appointed to ensure that the performance indicator - zero - was met. But then think of the various cultural commentators who would be freed up for a year to do the job. I would suggest Mark Lawson. Lawson, I think, has the breadth of understanding and the weight - culturally speaking - to do the job. But if Lawson declines, there's a rich array of choices: Richard Eyre, Mariella Frostrup, Lord Bragg. Any of them would do a splendid job. </p> <p>But then, when the year is over, what happens next? The artists, relieved for a whole year from the burden of promoting and explaining their current book/play/album/ exhibition, might produce far more in the year that followed than in any previous year. Which means that once the moratorium is over, there'll be more art around than ever and the whole merry-go-round will spin around faster than ever. </p> <p>How did we get here? Are there really more stories, more images about than ever before? Or does it just seem like that? There is a long tradition of distrust, or even panic, in the face of cultural overload. </p> <p>In the early 18th century Pope wrote, in The Dunciad, of a London drowning under a great tidal wave of words pouring out from Grub Street. The thousands of new novels produced every year during the 19th century, mostly consumed by female readers, were mocked in other publications, from Northanger Abbey's depiction of the dangerous effects of Gothic fiction on young women's sensibility, to the disdain shown by Lady Bracknell for Miss Prism's three-volume novel of \"more than usually revolting sentimentality\" in The Importance of Being Earnest.</p> <p> There has always been an ongoing battle between the Leavis Gang - those who, broadly speaking, want to rescue art from the crude world of the masses and the marketplace - and the Walter Benjamin gang, who have embraced the new possibilities for readers and audiences offered by new technologies, from the printing press to the internet. </p> <p>Year on year, decade on decade, century on century, since the Renaissance, western culture has accelerated. There are always more narratives and more images than the year before, and new technologies are constantly discovered that allow them to be distributed to a wider constituency and at a greater speed. And this has been a good thing: the lives of men and women have been enriched by being able to choose the narratives or images that allow them to define themselves, to make sense of their relationship with their community, to gain an insight into lives very different from their own. And more and more people every century have the opportunity to become producers as well as consumers. No longer are a few wise old men with private incomes justifying the ways of God - or Marx - to men. </p> <p>But is this an ever-widening virtuous circle? Can it keep on expanding infinitely and still be making our lives richer and better? There's still a lot to do. There are great sections of our society whose voices are only faintly heard in our art and culture. We need to expand artistic production to embrace them. Perhaps we can use the revolution in TV technology or internet publishing. </p> <p>Or have we reached a crunch point? If the Renaissance was a Big Bang that created the universe of narratives and images that we now inhabit, maybe we've reached the point where we've overstretched ourselves. Maybe, around about now, entropy kicks in and the whole edifice starts collapsing in on itself. Perhaps there simply isn't enough human experience and imagination to fuel a limitless number of narratives and images, or enough human beings to consume them. Once we reach a critical mass, the whole thing will start moving backwards. Every year, less and less culture and art, until finally we get back to a single mono-myth. </p> <p>Before Luther and the printing press, that mono-myth (allowing for a bit of local folklore) was the word of God. When entropy pulls us back this time, what mono-myth will greet us on our route to forming a black hole? Will it be the Bible once again? Will it be a single Great Truth, or will it be Ross and Phoebe and their Friends, or Simba and the Little Mermaid and the Disney world, that reveal themselves as being at the centre of our universe? </p> <p>A recklessly optimistic nature won't allow me to believe in the apocalyptic possibility of cultural entropy. Globalisation may well produce a \"gold standard\" of largely American culture, but there's little evidence that it will stop the production of richer and more diverse work. Around and between the global edifices of American film and television, the big art exhibition exported from capital city to capital city and the festival culture that allows the great directors of European theatre to show each other their Hamlets, diverse cultures will continue to flourish. </p> <p>And this diversity should be celebrated and protected. Absolutely. Of course. Totally agree. And yet... Why do I feel overwhelmed by cultural choices? Why do I so often wish there was less art? </p> <p>I don't think I'm alone in this. The marketeers understand how I feel. Order a piece of detective fiction from amazon.com and the website will recommend another detective novel.

      "bodyText": "There's a lot of art about at the moment. It's everywhere. It's really stressing me out. It's making me feel guilty. And I wish it would stop. For starters, there's all those books on the Booker shortlist. I ought to read them. Well, at least the Margaret Atwood. But if I read that one, I know I'll want to read more Atwood. I mean, I haven't even read The Handmaid's Tale, and everybody's read that. And there's a film of it that I ought to see, a TV adaptation I missed, and a fantastic opera version that opened in Copenhagen last year. And there's all those exhibitions. I want to have an opinion about Apocalypse. I mean, I've got an opinion because I've seen countless pieces in newspapers and magazines. I've witnessed Tracey Emin being repellent in various media. But I'd like to see the real thing at some point so that I don't go round feeling my opinion is a bit... well, second-hand. And that library in Peckham - that sounds fascinating. I need to work out where Peckham is, find the library, and see what I think of it for myself. And I've got to stop being so metropolitan. I've got to go to the Lowry Centre, the Tate in... oh God, is it Cornwall or Devon or...? And Smoking with Lulu at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. I would say that's a must-see. It's not just art I want to be aware of. There's culture, too. I mean, I'm not an elitist. I understand that the new Charlie's Angels movie embraces a fascinating range of discourses on gender politics. Can this really be true? I have to see it for myself. And I have to compare and contrast the new Westlife single and the new Tweenies single and... Look. Isn't there too much art around at the moment? Isn't there too much culture? Isn't it making us all unhappy? Clearly there's a big problem. And we've got to find a solution. Various moratoria have been suggested recently: no more Shakespeare plays produced for five years; nothing but new plays produced for 10 years. Well, I wonder whether we shouldn't go for the big one: nothing produced for a year. No images, no narratives, no \"experiences\", no performances. Nothing that could be considered, even by the most dogged commentator, as art or culture. Just a year to give us a chance to calm down, take stock and see whether we really want all this stuff. All of this would have to be firmly managed, of course. A cultural moratorium tsar would have to be appointed to ensure that the performance indicator - zero - was met. But then think of the various cultural commentators who would be freed up for a year to do the job. I would suggest Mark Lawson. Lawson, I think, has the breadth of understanding and the weight - culturally speaking - to do the job. But if Lawson declines, there's a rich array of choices: Richard Eyre, Mariella Frostrup, Lord Bragg. Any of them would do a splendid job. But then, when the year is over, what happens next?

      "body": "<p>Writing biographies teaches scepticism. When writing my first book, a biography of the historian AJP Taylor, I was startled to find how many people I interviewed told me stories I knew not to be true, or testified to events from the point of view of a witness on occasions when I knew they could not have been present. Even professional historians were guilty - not of lying but simply as victims of that strange human tendency to believe they had been present at a scene only imagined from a description. The mind rearranges events into what seems a rational progression, making order out of chaos. The historian Sir Lewis Namier wrote that we imagine the past and remember the future. </p> <p>In researching my book on Taylor, I sensed that much of what I was told was biased or partial. Whenever I came across an interpretation of events or behaviour I tried, wherever possible, to test it against the ascertainable facts. Then I began to apply this method to my own life. I saw that many of the conclusions I had reached rested on shaky foundations. </p> <p>So much of every family's past is obscure, wilfully or otherwise. To understand what it means to be another person, to make sense of the past, a biographer needs to imagine what it must have been like for his subject, to hypothesise about motives and causes, and then to test these hypotheses against what is known. Like a scientist, like a detective, the biographer proceeds from what is known to explore what is not. </p> <p>I had a privileged childhood: private education, a large, uncomfortable house in west London, no shortage of toys or holidays, let alone food or warmth, which - as my parents never ceased to remind my sister and myself - many children in poorer parts of the world lacked. As a result, I grew up feeling vaguely guilty about my circumstances. I railed against my parents for sending me to such a good school, and discounted my academic successes on the grounds that with such advantages, to fail was hardly possible. As soon as I was old enough to choose, I decided to deviate from the ordained route by refusing to sit Oxbridge entrance. </p> <p>In my teens, in the late 1960s and early 70s, I thought myself part of a revolt against middle-class values. I taunted my father with being a bourgeois - as if I had ever been, or ever would be, anything else. He never reproached me. I think of him now with love and slight shame. I try to imagine what his life must have been like: boarding school, sent to sea at 16, the terrifying war years when he served in submarines and on convoy duty, arriving back at Waterloo station with only the clothes he stood up in after his ship was sunk, and later, as a penniless art student, and then a young husband, striving to provide for his wife and babies. </p> <p>I never knew my grandfathers. There is a picture of my father's father holding me. I later discovered that he was a bigamist and a bankrupt. He died soon after I was born, leaving my father nothing but a disgruntled widow to care for. My mother's father was a more shadowy figure. Nobody seemed to want to talk about him. I assumed he had originated from the same petit-bourgeois background as my mother. I discovered only recently that he too had lived to see me born, dying while I was a baby. I knew only that he had been a surveyor and an engineer, manager of a small factory in Ceylon. I never realised that he had a life in England, that he had been born here and died here. I didn't even know his name. </p> <p>My mother explained that he had been virtually a stranger to her too; my grandmother had not liked life in Ceylon and had returned to England after a few months with her elder daughter, leaving her husband behind. She was pregnant with my mother, who was born in England several months later, so my grandfather saw his younger daughter for the first time when he came home to Lincoln on leave, when she was already two and a half. He came back to England four years later, and then again after another five years, when my grandmother was dying. </p> <p>My mother remembers being embarrassed by this stranger who tried to embrace her, and fleeing the room. After my grandmother died in 1937, my mother and her sister were brought up by an aunt, my grandmother's sister. My mother did not see her father again until after the war, when she was a young woman. He was by now married to his second wife, a missionary teacher he had met in Ceylon. Together they retired to the Isle of Wight. </p> <p>This was all I knew of him until a few months ago, when a package arrived containing copies of letters and photographs unearthed by a distant cousin in Australia. There was a photograph of three urchin boys in flat caps standing behind a stone wall: one of them, my grandfather, caught in the act of throwing a snowball (or perhaps shamming). </p> <p>Most remarkable was a letter, dated November 28 1896, written from an address in Liverpool in a looping hand by my grandfather's elder sister, Lennie May, then 16. As I read her letter, I realised with a jolt its importance to me. \"Dear Uncle John,\" it read (I had no idea then who Uncle John might be): \"I am writing to tell you how affairs stand. Father is not working. We are all bare-footed again for he has pawned our boots, in fact, he has sold everything saleable, we have not even a decent bed to sleep on, and I cannot bear to see the children suffer so, for Mother's sake... the poor children are in a state of semi-starvation... they never have anything in the way of nourishment... your affectionate niece, Lennie.\" There was a postscript: \"Please do not mention me having written to you... </p> <p>On the back of this letter, in a different hand, were the words: \"Should the child be favoured with a reply, let it kindly be addressed to her at 17 Dawsons Grove, Liverpool and the writer will hand it to her.

Six months earlier, their mother had died as the result of a miscarriage, having borne 11 children in 18 years. Three had succumbed to bronchial pneumonia in the space of a few months. It seems that as the eldest daughter, Lennie May was left struggling to look after the other five children. My grandfather, Frederick, was one of these, then aged 11. Lennie's father never gave her money to buy food and often came home very late. He had lost his job, and it seems clear that he was drinking heavily. They were living in a slum in one of the coldest parts of the city, where diphtheria, whooping cough, and bronchial pneumonia were rampant and typhoid not uncommon; the children could not survive much longer unless something changed. </p> <p>In desperation, Lennie May wrote to her mother's brother, \"Uncle John\", a prosperous grocer in Broadheath, Cheshire, on the outskirts of what is now Greater Manchester. It seems likely that she was helped by a kindly neighbour, who wrote the note on the back of the letter to protect Lennie from her father's wrath. </p> <p>This plea for help prompted John to travel to Liverpool to rescue the children. Lennie May and her charges were scooped up and taken to live with their uncle and his family; their uncles, John and his brother Samuel, took steps to become the children's legal guardians. My grandfather was sent to boarding school in Lincolnshire and afterwards apprenticed to Ruston's, an engineering firm in Lincoln. His later life gave no hint of how hard his early life had been, though he always retained a special affection for his older sister who, perhaps unknown to him, had saved the children from almost certain death in that Liverpool slum. </p> <p>Also in the package were documents which explained much of the background to Lennie May's letter. Her mother, my great-grandmother Sarah Ann Hulme, came from a respectable Lancashire farming family. There is a photograph of her which hints at a certain docile gullibility; and of my great-grandfather, Owen Peake, a handsome man, younger than Sarah Ann, with a reputation as an irresponsible wastrel. </p> <p>Perhaps he married her for money. Their marriage was very much against the wishes of my great-grandmother's family; in will after will, they specified that money was to be left in trust for Sarah Ann and the children, where Owen could not lay his hands upon it. Owen seems to have worked for his father at first, describing himself as a metal finisher and polisher, and later a journeyman hot water engineer. </p> <p>He and his new wife lived first near his family in Altrincham, and then moved for a while to London, where Lennie May was born in the shadow of Waterloo station.

      "bodyText": "Writing biographies teaches scepticism. When writing my first book, a biography of the historian AJP Taylor, I was startled to find how many people I interviewed told me stories I knew not to be true, or testified to events from the point of view of a witness on occasions when I knew they could not have been present. Even professional historians were guilty - not of lying but simply as victims of that strange human tendency to believe they had been present at a scene only imagined from a description. The mind rearranges events into what seems a rational progression, making order out of chaos. The historian Sir Lewis Namier wrote that we imagine the past and remember the future. In researching my book on Taylor, I sensed that much of what I was told was biased or partial. Whenever I came across an interpretation of events or behaviour I tried, wherever possible, to test it against the ascertainable facts. Then I began to apply this method to my own life. I saw that many of the conclusions I had reached rested on shaky foundations. So much of every family's past is obscure, wilfully or otherwise. To understand what it means to be another person, to make sense of the past, a biographer needs to imagine what it must have been like for his subject, to hypothesise about motives and causes, and then to test these hypotheses against what is known. Like a scientist, like a detective, the biographer proceeds from what is known to explore what is not. I had a privileged childhood: private education, a large, uncomfortable house in west London, no shortage of toys or holidays, let alone food or warmth, which - as my parents never ceased to remind my sister and myself - many children in poorer parts of the world lacked. As a result, I grew up feeling vaguely guilty about my circumstances. I railed against my parents for sending me to such a good school, and discounted my academic successes on the grounds that with such advantages, to fail was hardly possible. As soon as I was old enough to choose, I decided to deviate from the ordained route by refusing to sit Oxbridge entrance. In my teens, in the late 1960s and early 70s, I thought myself part of a revolt against middle-class values. I taunted my father with being a bourgeois - as if I had ever been, or ever would be, anything else. He never reproached me. I think of him now with love and slight shame. I try to imagine what his life must have been like: boarding school, sent to sea at 16, the terrifying war years when he served in submarines and on convoy duty, arriving back at Waterloo station with only the clothes he stood up in after his ship was sunk, and later, as a penniless art student, and then a young husband, striving to provide for his wife and babies. I never knew my grandfathers. There is a picture of my father's father holding me. I later discovered that he was a bigamist and a bankrupt. He died soon after I was born, leaving my father nothing but a disgruntled widow to care for. My mother's father was a more shadowy figure. Nobody seemed to want to talk about him. I assumed he had originated from the same petit-bourgeois background as my mother. I discovered only recently that he too had lived to see me born, dying while I was a baby. I knew only that he had been a surveyor and an engineer, manager of a small factory in Ceylon. I never realised that he had a life in England, that he had been born here and died here. I didn't even know his name. My mother explained that he had been virtually a stranger to her too; my grandmother had not liked life in Ceylon and had returned to England after a few months with her elder daughter, leaving her husband behind. She was pregnant with my mother, who was born in England several months later, so my grandfather saw his younger daughter for the first time when he came home to Lincoln on leave, when she was already two and a half. He came back to England four years later, and then again after another five years, when my grandmother was dying. My mother remembers being embarrassed by this stranger who tried to embrace her, and fleeing the room. After my grandmother died in 1937, my mother and her sister were brought up by an aunt, my grandmother's sister. My mother did not see her father again until after the war, when she was a young woman. He was by now married to his second wife, a missionary teacher he had met in Ceylon. Together they retired to the Isle of Wight. This was all I knew of him until a few months ago, when a package arrived containing copies of letters and photographs unearthed by a distant cousin in Australia. There was a photograph of three urchin boys in flat caps standing behind a stone wall: one of them, my grandfather, caught in the act of throwing a snowball (or perhaps shamming). Most remarkable was a letter, dated November 28 1896, written from an address in Liverpool in a looping hand by my grandfather's elder sister, Lennie May, then 16. As I read her letter, I realised with a jolt its importance to me. \"Dear Uncle John,\" it read (I had no idea then who Uncle John might be): \"I am writing to tell you how affairs stand. Father is not working. We are all bare-footed again for he has pawned our boots, in fact, he has sold everything saleable, we have not even a decent bed to sleep on, and I cannot bear to see the children suffer so, for Mother's sake... the poor children are in a state of semi-starvation... they never have anything in the way of nourishment... your affectionate niece, Lennie.\" There was a postscript: \"Please do not mention me having written to you... On the back of this letter, in a different hand, were the words: \"Should the child be favoured with a reply, let it kindly be addressed to her at 17 Dawsons Grove, Liverpool and the writer will hand it to her. She fears getting into trouble with her father if he knew she wrote.\" The letter only hints at the terrible suffering Lennie and her younger brothers and sisters had endured. Six months earlier, their mother had died as the result of a miscarriage, having borne 11 children in 18 years. Three had succumbed to bronchial pneumonia in the space of a few months. It seems that as the eldest daughter, Lennie May was left struggling to look after the other five children. My grandfather, Frederick, was one of these, then aged 11. Lennie's father never gave her money to buy food and often came home very late. He had lost his job, and it seems clear that he was drinking heavily.

Like the original work itself, this version of The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny is the product of an intense collaboration. </p> <p>Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill wrote the piece in 1930 as an attempt to make Weimar Germany see sense before its collapse began. The Hamburg version, the work of a controversial partnership between the conductor Ingo Metzmacher and the director Peter Konwitschny, reminds us that the essential inhumanity of capitalist self-interest remains an omnipresent danger, particularly now that the altruism of the socialist ideal has been rejected. </p> <p>Brecht and Weill located their nightmarish paradise in America, opening the work as a gang of no-goods emerge from a broken-down car in the middle of nowhere to found their city with ill-gotten lucre. Konwitschny and Metzmacher bring it closer to home. </p> <p>We begin with an almighty bang as a vehicle seemingly crashes into the back of the Staatsoper itself. The auditorium doors open to admit Mechthild Gessendorf's alarming Leokadja Begbick, who looks as if she has just screwed every Reeperbahn prowler in sight. A splay-legged madame in red silk and ocelot, she presides over the proceedings with the daring, monumental obscenity that is characteristic of the production. </p> <p>As Mahagonny is built, the conventional divisions between stage, pit and public buckle and bend. The city's victims scramble through the audience to the stage. Maps of Mahagonny rain down from the ceiling, informing us that it lies some 21,516km west of Hamburg, though the plan of streets and docks leaves no doubt as to where we actually are. </p> <p>When the city is at its apogee, the orchestra is transported from pit to stage. Metzmacher dons a silver bandleader's jacket, and marches his musicians in triumphal procession round the set. Most productions play the goings-on of Mahagonny's denizens for laughs. Konwitschny, however, just flings everything in our faces with unremitting force. </p> <p>The glutton Jakob Schmidt decides to eat himself to death and expires in a pool of excretions. When Begbick ups the price of the local girls, the men retaliate with a frenzy of mutual masturbation in the city's public loos. Mahagonny's God is the terminally sick deity of Nietzsche, whose rejection by a whisky-sodden humanity brings about his demise. </p> <p>It's a place where honesty can't survive. Albert Bonnema's touching Paul Ackermann goes to his pauper's death with a look of unspeakable horror on his face. Jenny, the good time girl who loves him yet betrays him, is Inga Nielsen, one of the few sopranos to look convincing in skimpy undies. Far from the brazen harshness that we usually get, Jenny too is a victim. Musically, the production is staggering, presenting us with a gallery of alarmingly convincing portraits of human viciousness. Metzmacher splits the score open to reveal both its erotic beauty and its terrifying malignancy. </p> <p>Inevitably, given the production's riskiness, there are occasional flaws. Balance is lost when the performers are in the auditorium. The shifting of the orchestra from pit to stage has to happen in the interval, which means that the first act finale plays itself out in a not very convincing bathhouse or orgy-room. The faults are minor, however. </p> <p>As the final roll call of capitalism's inhumanity began, I sat there with a lump in my throat, overwhelmed with anger. This is Weill's centenary year and there has never been a more convincing vindication of his work. In London, which is closer to the nightmare of Mahagonny than Hamburg, we haven't produced a Weill tribute to equal it - and I doubt that prudish Britain ever could. </p> <p>\u0095 In repertory at the Hamburg Staatsoper until December 2.

Maps of Mahagonny rain down from the ceiling, informing us that it lies some 21,516km west of Hamburg, though the plan of streets and docks leaves no doubt as to where we actually are. When the city is at its apogee, the orchestra is transported from pit to stage. Metzmacher dons a silver bandleader's jacket, and marches his musicians in triumphal procession round the set. Most productions play the goings-on of Mahagonny's denizens for laughs. Konwitschny, however, just flings everything in our faces with unremitting force. The glutton Jakob Schmidt decides to eat himself to death and expires in a pool of excretions. When Begbick ups the price of the local girls, the men retaliate with a frenzy of mutual masturbation in the city's public loos. Mahagonny's God is the terminally sick deity of Nietzsche, whose rejection by a whisky-sodden humanity brings about his demise. It's a place where honesty can't survive. Albert Bonnema's touching Paul Ackermann goes to his pauper's death with a look of unspeakable horror on his face. Jenny, the good time girl who loves him yet betrays him, is Inga Nielsen, one of the few sopranos to look convincing in skimpy undies. Far from the brazen harshness that we usually get, Jenny too is a victim. Musically, the production is staggering, presenting us with a gallery of alarmingly convincing portraits of human viciousness. Metzmacher splits the score open to reveal both its erotic beauty and its terrifying malignancy. Inevitably, given the production's riskiness, there are occasional flaws. Balance is lost when the performers are in the auditorium. The shifting of the orchestra from pit to stage has to happen in the interval, which means that the first act finale plays itself out in a not very convincing bathhouse or orgy-room. The faults are minor, however. As the final roll call of capitalism's inhumanity began, I sat there with a lump in my throat, overwhelmed with anger. This is Weill's centenary year and there has never been a more convincing vindication of his work. In London, which is closer to the nightmare of Mahagonny than Hamburg, we haven't produced a Weill tribute to equal it - and I doubt that prudish Britain ever could. \u0095 In repertory at the Hamburg Staatsoper until December 2.

      "body": "<p>William Hazlitt was England's supreme essayist, and one of the greatest writers of prose in the English language. He was also the best and most important critic of the Romantic period, making original contributions to appreciation of art, theatre, literature and philosophy. And as if that were not enough, he was also a hard-hitting political polemicist who, at the expense of his own chances for worldly advancement, defended a radical stance which was not just unpopular but actively persecuted in the Regency period of the early 19th century - as shown by the fact that some of his friends found themselves in prison for views that he and they shared. </p> <p>Hazlitt is sometimes labelled a \"Romantic\" like Coleridge and Wordsworth, who were first his friends and later his enemies. If the label has any value, it is because he was an intensely personal writer, vividly present in everything he wrote. He argued for his opinions without appealing to the authority, or needing the protection, of orthodox ideas or established ideologies. </p> <p>A good example is afforded by his innovative style of criticism. The critics who came before him attacked Shakespeare for failing to observe the theatrical \"unities\" of time and place, as prescribed two thousand years before by Aristotle. Hazlitt was not interested in rules and formalities; he reacted to theatre - and to art, literature and ideas - as a man of deep feeling and independent mind, asking only whether he was being presented with truth, and in a manner that was well done of its kind. He demanded honesty in art, not orthodoxy; and he listened to his own responses, which were keen and searching, for the basis of his judgments. </p> <p>As a result he changed the way people thought and wrote about the arts, and indirectly helped to liberate them from the rule of the past. Hazlitt wrote incessantly, not just because he made his living that way, but because he was impelled to write; it was his way of thinking, and of making sense of things. He thereby transmuted his life and thought into literature, leaving a body of work - 20 volumes' worth, in the standard edition - which continues to delight and instruct. Many of his essays are classics of the English tongue. </p> <p>He has always had admirers, and his reputation, great and controversial in his own day, has never ceased to grow, though for a time it was clouded by Victorian delicacy, which was offended by his confessional style and most of all by his Liber Amoris, the searingly painful account of his notorious middle-aged passion for the young daughter of his landlady. Hazlitt attracted sharply different responses from his contemporaries. One view is well represented by John Keats and his friend John Hamilton Reynolds, who ardently admired him. They attended his lectures, read aloud to each other from his essays, and formulated their theories of poetry in response to his views. Through their eyes Hazlitt appears at his best, because when he was with such ambitious young men of talent, he was relaxed and expansive, ready to talk endlessly about art and philosophy - not in monologue, as Coleridge did, but as a conversationalist in the same mould as his friend Charles Lamb. </p> <p>In a letter of April 1817, Reynolds describes entertaining Hazlitt to dinner: \"On Thursday last Hazlitt was with me at home, and remained with us till three o'clock in the morning! - full of eloquence, - warm, lofty, and communicative on everything imaginative and intelligent - He is indeed great company, and leaves a weight on the mind, which 'it can hardly bear'. He is full of what Dr Johnson terms 'good talk'. His countenance also is extremely fine: - a sunken and melancholy face, - a forehead lined with thought and bearing a full and strange pulsation on exciting subjects, - an eye, dashed in its light with sorrow, but kindling and living at intellectual moments, - and a stream of coal-black hair dropping around all. Such a face, so silent and so sensitive, is indeed the banner of the mind. I fear you will be tired of this long 'personality', but I remember having read a few papers of his to you, and therefore imagine you are not wholly uninterested in him.\" </p> <p>Reynolds' portrait has an air of hyperbole, but it chimes exactly with accounts given by others who enjoyed Hazlitt's friendship. A very different picture is given by Thomas De Quincey, never a friend to Hazlitt, still less so after the detection of his unacknowledged borrowings from Hazlitt's writings (for which he was uncomfortably obliged to apologise). </p> <p>\"His inveterate misanthropy was constitutional,\" De Quincey wrote. \"Exasperated it certainly had been by accidents of life, by disappointments, by mortifications, by insults, and still more by having wilfully placed himself in collision from the first with all the interests that were in the sunshine of the world, and of all the persons that were then powerful in England... A friend of his it was who told me that involuntarily, when Hazlitt put his hand within his waistcoat (as a mere unconscious trick of habit), he himself felt a sudden recoil of fear, as from one who was searching for a hidden dagger.\" </p> <p>These two portraits - drawn from a number of either kind - could scarcely be more at variance. For two generations after Hazlitt's death it was De Quincey's portrait which prevailed, for although some thought him the greatest thinker and critical writer of his age, others saw him as a gloomy pessimistic Jacobin motivated by party spleen and personal antipathies. Leaving aside the melodramatic reference to a dagger, chosen to allegorise Hazlitt's fearsome powers as a polemicist, there is some truth in De Quincey's picture, for Hazlitt was indeed at loggerheads with the vested interests of his time, he indeed never courted favour with those \"in the sunshine of the world\" because he suspected that most of them had got there by dishonest or despicable means, and he indeed suffered much from disappointments in his personal life and insults in his public life. </p> <p>The disappointments and insults were connected, for this was an age of violent polemic and party strife, in which Hazlitt was the subject of constant attacks by the Tory press, of a kind we could not now tolerate. They called him depraved, blasphemous, malign, a fiend who endangered traditions and proprieties, a blackguard, a quack, a \"pimpled coxcomb\". </p> <p>In its most vicious style one of the chief Tory magazines, Blackwood's, was capable of ranting, \"Let execrations gurgle in your gullet, distended with the rising gorge of your blackest bile; belch out your bitter blackguardism lest you burst; clench your fists till your fretted palms are pierced with the jagged edge of nails bitten in impotent desperation, stamp with cloven feet on the fetid flags of your sty till the mire mounts to your mouth\" - and so on. </p> <p>More sober journals, recognising Hazlitt's genius, applauded \"the spirit and energy of this extraordinary writer, whose work abounds with striking beauties, and with the enlightened spirit of truth and critical discrimination\", but they did not wholly cancel the harm done. Hazlitt returned the Tory attacks with interest, but his enemies made ammunition out of his private sufferings, thereby doubling them. </p> <p>A man who could inspire such different responses, and who could think and write as Hazlitt did - \"We think we are very fine fellows nowadays,\" Robert Louis Stevenson told his contemporaries, \"but none of us can write like Hazlitt\" - deserves explanation. The explanation is his life, from which all that he felt and thought sprang; so to explain him is to tell his story - and not least one of the most famous (or perhaps infamous) episodes in it, his unrequited love for a woman less than half his age. His account of the affair, the Liber Amoris, is so frank and painful that it destroyed his reputation among his contemporaries and the Victorians who came immediately afterwards. </p> <p>Hazlitt's disastrous passion began in the summer of 1820. He was 42, and at the height of his fame and powers. He had been separated from his first wife for three years, and was living a bachelor's life in lodgings. The young woman, Sarah Walker, was the 19-year-old daughter of a boarding-house landlady. </p> <p>The unhappy tale began when, on August 16 - Hazlitt's third day in his new lodgings at Southampton Buildings near Chancery Lane in London - he saw Sarah Walker for the first time. She brought breakfast to his rooms, and he was immediately struck by her manner. He watched as she went away, mesmerised by her walk, for she had a waving, gliding step which he found graceful beyond description. At the door she turned and looked him full in the eye, her strange, dark gaze burning him to the depths of his soul. He was stunned, amazed - and in love in an instant. </p> <p>It might seem that, for one who suffered frequently from infatuations (his friend Patmore said \"he was always in love with somebody or other\") and who therefore understood their nature, Hazlitt should have been well armed against his vulnerability to them. But his own views explain why he allowed himself to become besotted in this case. Love and desire, he said, are blessings when mutual (which he thought they rarely were, except in novels), but like the Furies when unrequited. Either way one cannot escape them. They are non-rational, and the will cannot oppose them. They take hold and run their course, and their victim can do nothing but survive as best he - usually, in Hazlitt's view, he - can. Hazlitt accordingly never attempted to resist. He gave in to his feelings at their first impulse, and invariably suffered the consequences. In the case of Sarah Walker, \"suffered\" is a wholly inadequate word. His obsession with her almost drove him mad. </p> <p> Hazlitt also therefore believed in love at first sight. More accurately, he believed that what goes by that name is only a recognition of an antecedently cherished ideal; that in a sense it is not \"first sight\" at all. \"I do not think that what is called Love at first sight is so great an absurdity as it is sometimes imagined to be,\" he wrote soon after meeting Sarah Walker. \"We generally make up our minds beforehand to the sort of person we should like, grave or gay, black, brown or fair; with golden tresses or with raven locks; - and when we meet with a complete example of the qualities we admire, the bargain is soon struck. We have never seen any thing to come up to our newly discovered goddess before, but she is what we have been all our lives looking for. The idol we fall down and worship is an image familiar to our minds. It has been present to our waking thoughts, it has haunted us in our dreams.\" </p> <p>A few years before, in a review of a book on European literature, Hazlitt had pointedly disagreed with its author's regret that Petrarch and his Laura had not been able to enjoy a longer intimacy. \"The whole is in better keeping as it is,\" Hazlitt wrote. \"The love of a man like Petrarch would have been less in character, if it had been less ideal. For the purposes of inspiration, a single interview was quite sufficient. The smile which sank into his heart the first time he ever beheld her, played round her lips ever after, the look with which her eyes first met his, never passed away. The image of his mistress still haunted his mind, and was recalled by every object in nature. Even death could not dissolve the fine illusion: for that which exists in the imagination is alone imperishable.\" These words struck home to a reader in Paris who felt that they described his own experience exactly. The reader was Stendhal, who, in making a note of this passage, was not for the first time copying out Hazlitt's words. The two met in Paris some years later, and became friends. </p> <p>Those words - \"The smile which sank into his heart the first time he ever beheld her\" - could scarcely have been more prophetic, given the beginning and the manner of Hazlitt's passion for Sarah Walker. But she did not impress everyone. Hazlitt's friend Procter described her thus: \"Her face was round and small, and her eyes were motionless, glassy, and without any speculation (apparently) in them. Her movements in walking were remarkable, for I never observed her to make a step. She went onwards in a wavy, sinuous manner, like the movement of a snake. She was silent, or uttered monosyllables only, and very demure. Her steady, unmoving gaze upon the person she was addressing was exceedingly unpleasant. The Germans would have extracted a romance from her, endowing her perhaps with some diabolic attribute.\" </p> <p> Although this description was written after the event, in pity for Hazlitt and dislike of Sarah Walker - though it is not as unfriendly as the description offered by Hazlitt's first wife: \"thin and bony as the scrag end of a neck of mutton\" - it tallies exactly with Hazlitt's own descriptions, except that he gave them a different cast. Her walk, her sphinx-like eyes, her demure silence, and her round face and slender figure, all recur in Hazlitt's account as matters for celebration, and as the barbs that snagged his soul and would not let him go. </p> <p>Hazlitt longed for the kind of romantic love found in novels. He was sceptical about whether it could exist, for such love would amount to something truly metaphysical: to a companionship of hearts and souls that would cure the inexpressible loneliness of being. Yet he hoped for it anyway, and sought it endlessly. By the time he fell in love with Sarah Walker his longing for the realisation of this dream had grown acute. He was ripe for love, and fell hopelessly into it at the first faint, imagined touch of its presence. </p> <p>For 18 months after Sarah Walker's sinuous movements and meaningful looks captivated Hazlitt, she spent hours every day in his room, sitting on his knee, kissing and fondling him endlessly, and being fondled in return. He did not try to have sexual intercourse with her, because he idealised her and wanted to marry her, and therefore wished to believe her \"pure\". But their intimacy did not fall far short. </p> <p>During the first year he was often blissfully happy. She was \"the only woman that ever made me think she loved me, and that feeling was so new to me, and so delicious, that 'it will never from my heart' \" (sic). She made him think that she loved him without ever telling him so directly - on the contrary, she refused to say that she loved him, nor would she promise him anything for the future. When he asked, \"Do you love me? Could you love me?\" she merely said, \"You should judge by my actions\" and \"Do I seem indifferent?\" Indeed, her actions made Hazlitt hope, and hope was enough at the outset. He showered her with gifts, some of them expensive: an ivory flageolet, a gold heart-shaped locket, a cap and gown, silk cloth, tickets for the theatre, copies of the books he had written, even his most treasured miniature statue of Napoleon. </p> <p>But one day she told him something he had not known before. The reason she could never feel more than friendship towards him, she said, was that she still nurtured a tenderness for someone else, a former lodger in the house who, because of a \"difference of station\", had been obliged to leave to prevent their mutual feelings going further. This continuing attachment posed a barrier, she said, to her ever loving anyone else. </p> <p>This was a severe blow. Instead of answering his questions evasively, she was now, Hazlitt reported, saying, \"No, never.\" He was hurt and troubled by the news, but it did not kill his hope. He thought that his passion must surely one day make her love him in return, so exalted was it, and so profound. And then he found that he was charmed by her fidelity to one she had loved, and he honoured her for it. And still she sat in his lap daily, twining her arms round his neck, kissing him, enjoying his caresses. </p> <p>But that was before an even more devastating blow precipitated a crisis in their relationship. A new lodger arrived, younger and more handsome, and Sarah Walker discovered for herself what it was like to fall in love. She rejected Hazlitt therefore, and his suffering over the next three years is almost indescribable. He did everything he could to win her back, not least divorcing his estranged wife so that he could be free to marry Sarah; but it only prolonged his agony. Mary Shelley, the daughter of his friend Godwin, having not seen him during those years because she was in Italy, described his appearance when the crisis was nearly over: \"I never was so shocked in my life - gaunt and thin, his hair scattered, his cheekbones projecting - but for his voice and smile I should not have known him. His smile brought tears to my eyes, it was like a sunbeam illuminating the most melancholy of ruins.\" </p> <p>And yet in the years during and after Hazlitt's great passion for Sarah Walker, he wrote his best works - essays of incomparable power and beauty, exploring the human condition, discussing art and letters, dissecting ideas, offering instruction and wit, insight, controversy, and pleasure - and, in the most famous of his books, The Spirit of the Age, choosing with unerring accuracy those among his contemporaries whose reputations he thought would last into history, and anatomising them in his penetrating and witty way. As with everything he wrote, his genius as a writer of prose takes one's breath away, and leaves a vivid impression of a man whose passionately lived life was turned by great art into literature, and made a lasting monument to the human spirit. </p> <p>\u0095 AC Grayling's The Quarrel of the Age, a biography of Hazlitt, is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (\u00a325).<br> To obtain a copy at the discount price of \u00a321 plus 99p p&amp;p, call the Guardian CultureShop on 0800-3166 102, or send a cheque to Guardian CultureShop, 32-34 Park Royal Road, London NW10 7LN.</p>",

      "bodyText": "William Hazlitt was England's supreme essayist, and one of the greatest writers of prose in the English language. He was also the best and most important critic of the Romantic period, making original contributions to appreciation of art, theatre, literature and philosophy. And as if that were not enough, he was also a hard-hitting political polemicist who, at the expense of his own chances for worldly advancement, defended a radical stance which was not just unpopular but actively persecuted in the Regency period of the early 19th century - as shown by the fact that some of his friends found themselves in prison for views that he and they shared. Hazlitt is sometimes labelled a \"Romantic\" like Coleridge and Wordsworth, who were first his friends and later his enemies. If the label has any value, it is because he was an intensely personal writer, vividly present in everything he wrote. He argued for his opinions without appealing to the authority, or needing the protection, of orthodox ideas or established ideologies. A good example is afforded by his innovative style of criticism. The critics who came before him attacked Shakespeare for failing to observe the theatrical \"unities\" of time and place, as prescribed two thousand years before by Aristotle. Hazlitt was not interested in rules and formalities; he reacted to theatre - and to art, literature and ideas - as a man of deep feeling and independent mind, asking only whether he was being presented with truth, and in a manner that was well done of its kind. He demanded honesty in art, not orthodoxy; and he listened to his own responses, which were keen and searching, for the basis of his judgments. As a result he changed the way people thought and wrote about the arts, and indirectly helped to liberate them from the rule of the past. Hazlitt wrote incessantly, not just because he made his living that way, but because he was impelled to write; it was his way of thinking, and of making sense of things. He thereby transmuted his life and thought into literature, leaving a body of work - 20 volumes' worth, in the standard edition - which continues to delight and instruct. Many of his essays are classics of the English tongue. He has always had admirers, and his reputation, great and controversial in his own day, has never ceased to grow, though for a time it was clouded by Victorian delicacy, which was offended by his confessional style and most of all by his Liber Amoris, the searingly painful account of his notorious middle-aged passion for the young daughter of his landlady. Hazlitt attracted sharply different responses from his contemporaries. One view is well represented by John Keats and his friend John Hamilton Reynolds, who ardently admired him. They attended his lectures, read aloud to each other from his essays, and formulated their theories of poetry in response to his views. Through their eyes Hazlitt appears at his best, because when he was with such ambitious young men of talent, he was relaxed and expansive, ready to talk endlessly about art and philosophy - not in monologue, as Coleridge did, but as a conversationalist in the same mould as his friend Charles Lamb. In a letter of April 1817, Reynolds describes entertaining Hazlitt to dinner: \"On Thursday last Hazlitt was with me at home, and remained with us till three o'clock in the morning! - full of eloquence, - warm, lofty, and communicative on everything imaginative and intelligent - He is indeed great company, and leaves a weight on the mind, which 'it can hardly bear'. He is full of what Dr Johnson terms 'good talk'. His countenance also is extremely fine: - a sunken and melancholy face, - a forehead lined with thought and bearing a full and strange pulsation on exciting subjects, - an eye, dashed in its light with sorrow, but kindling and living at intellectual moments, - and a stream of coal-black hair dropping around all. Such a face, so silent and so sensitive, is indeed the banner of the mind. I fear you will be tired of this long 'personality', but I remember having read a few papers of his to you, and therefore imagine you are not wholly uninterested in him.\" Reynolds' portrait has an air of hyperbole, but it chimes exactly with accounts given by others who enjoyed Hazlitt's friendship. A very different picture is given by Thomas De Quincey, never a friend to Hazlitt, still less so after the detection of his unacknowledged borrowings from Hazlitt's writings (for which he was uncomfortably obliged to apologise). \"His inveterate misanthropy was constitutional,\" De Quincey wrote. \"Exasperated it certainly had been by accidents of life, by disappointments, by mortifications, by insults, and still more by having wilfully placed himself in collision from the first with all the interests that were in the sunshine of the world, and of all the persons that were then powerful in England... A friend of his it was who told me that involuntarily, when Hazlitt put his hand within his waistcoat (as a mere unconscious trick of habit), he himself felt a sudden recoil of fear, as from one who was searching for a hidden dagger.\" These two portraits - drawn from a number of either kind - could scarcely be more at variance. For two generations after Hazlitt's death it was De Quincey's portrait which prevailed, for although some thought him the greatest thinker and critical writer of his age, others saw him as a gloomy pessimistic Jacobin motivated by party spleen and personal antipathies. Leaving aside the melodramatic reference to a dagger, chosen to allegorise Hazlitt's fearsome powers as a polemicist, there is some truth in De Quincey's picture, for Hazlitt was indeed at loggerheads with the vested interests of his time, he indeed never courted favour with those \"in the sunshine of the world\" because he suspected that most of them had got there by dishonest or despicable means, and he indeed suffered much from disappointments in his personal life and insults in his public life. The disappointments and insults were connected, for this was an age of violent polemic and party strife, in which Hazlitt was the subject of constant attacks by the Tory press, of a kind we could not now tolerate. They called him depraved, blasphemous, malign, a fiend who endangered traditions and proprieties, a blackguard, a quack, a \"pimpled coxcomb\". In its most vicious style one of the chief Tory magazines, Blackwood's, was capable of ranting, \"Let execrations gurgle in your gullet, distended with the rising gorge of your blackest bile; belch out your bitter blackguardism lest you burst; clench your fists till your fretted palms are pierced with the jagged edge of nails bitten in impotent desperation, stamp with cloven feet on the fetid flags of your sty till the mire mounts to your mouth\" - and so on. More sober journals, recognising Hazlitt's genius, applauded \"the spirit and energy of this extraordinary writer, whose work abounds with striking beauties, and with the enlightened spirit of truth and critical discrimination\", but they did not wholly cancel the harm done. Hazlitt returned the Tory attacks with interest, but his enemies made ammunition out of his private sufferings, thereby doubling them. A man who could inspire such different responses, and who could think and write as Hazlitt did - \"We think we are very fine fellows nowadays,\" Robert Louis Stevenson told his contemporaries, \"but none of us can write like Hazlitt\" - deserves explanation. The explanation is his life, from which all that he felt and thought sprang; so to explain him is to tell his story - and not least one of the most famous (or perhaps infamous) episodes in it, his unrequited love for a woman less than half his age. His account of the affair, the Liber Amoris, is so frank and painful that it destroyed his reputation among his contemporaries and the Victorians who came immediately afterwards. Hazlitt's disastrous passion began in the summer of 1820. He was 42, and at the height of his fame and powers. He had been separated from his first wife for three years, and was living a bachelor's life in lodgings. The young woman, Sarah Walker, was the 19-year-old daughter of a boarding-house landlady. The unhappy tale began when, on August 16 - Hazlitt's third day in his new lodgings at Southampton Buildings near Chancery Lane in London - he saw Sarah Walker for the first time. She brought breakfast to his rooms, and he was immediately struck by her manner. He watched as she went away, mesmerised by her walk, for she had a waving, gliding step which he found graceful beyond description. At the door she turned and looked him full in the eye, her strange, dark gaze burning him to the depths of his soul. He was stunned, amazed - and in love in an instant. It might seem that, for one who suffered frequently from infatuations (his friend Patmore said \"he was always in love with somebody or other\") and who therefore understood their nature, Hazlitt should have been well armed against his vulnerability to them. But his own views explain why he allowed himself to become besotted in this case. Love and desire, he said, are blessings when mutual (which he thought they rarely were, except in novels), but like the Furies when unrequited. Either way one cannot escape them. They are non-rational, and the will cannot oppose them. They take hold and run their course, and their victim can do nothing but survive as best he - usually, in Hazlitt's view, he - can. Hazlitt accordingly never attempted to resist. He gave in to his feelings at their first impulse, and invariably suffered the consequences. In the case of Sarah Walker, \"suffered\" is a wholly inadequate word. His obsession with her almost drove him mad. Hazlitt also therefore believed in love at first sight. More accurately, he believed that what goes by that name is only a recognition of an antecedently cherished ideal; that in a sense it is not \"first sight\" at all. \"I do not think that what is called Love at first sight is so great an absurdity as it is sometimes imagined to be,\" he wrote soon after meeting Sarah Walker. \"We generally make up our minds beforehand to the sort of person we should like, grave or gay, black, brown or fair; with golden tresses or with raven locks; - and when we meet with a complete example of the qualities we admire, the bargain is soon struck. We have never seen any thing to come up to our newly discovered goddess before, but she is what we have been all our lives looking for. The idol we fall down and worship is an image familiar to our minds. It has been present to our waking thoughts, it has haunted us in our dreams.\" A few years before, in a review of a book on European literature, Hazlitt had pointedly disagreed with its author's regret that Petrarch and his Laura had not been able to enjoy a longer intimacy. \"The whole is in better keeping as it is,\" Hazlitt wrote. \"The love of a man like Petrarch would have been less in character, if it had been less ideal. For the purposes of inspiration, a single interview was quite sufficient. The smile which sank into his heart the first time he ever beheld her, played round her lips ever after, the look with which her eyes first met his, never passed away. The image of his mistress still haunted his mind, and was recalled by every object in nature. Even death could not dissolve the fine illusion: for that which exists in the imagination is alone imperishable.\" These words struck home to a reader in Paris who felt that they described his own experience exactly. The reader was Stendhal, who, in making a note of this passage, was not for the first time copying out Hazlitt's words. The two met in Paris some years later, and became friends. Those words - \"The smile which sank into his heart the first time he ever beheld her\" - could scarcely have been more prophetic, given the beginning and the manner of Hazlitt's passion for Sarah Walker. But she did not impress everyone. Hazlitt's friend Procter described her thus: \"Her face was round and small, and her eyes were motionless, glassy, and without any speculation (apparently) in them. Her movements in walking were remarkable, for I never observed her to make a step. She went onwards in a wavy, sinuous manner, like the movement of a snake. She was silent, or uttered monosyllables only, and very demure. Her steady, unmoving gaze upon the person she was addressing was exceedingly unpleasant. The Germans would have extracted a romance from her, endowing her perhaps with some diabolic attribute.\" Although this description was written after the event, in pity for Hazlitt and dislike of Sarah Walker - though it is not as unfriendly as the description offered by Hazlitt's first wife: \"thin and bony as the scrag end of a neck of mutton\" - it tallies exactly with Hazlitt's own descriptions, except that he gave them a different cast. Her walk, her sphinx-like eyes, her demure silence, and her round face and slender figure, all recur in Hazlitt's account as matters for celebration, and as the barbs that snagged his soul and would not let him go. Hazlitt longed for the kind of romantic love found in novels. He was sceptical about whether it could exist, for such love would amount to something truly metaphysical: to a companionship of hearts and souls that would cure the inexpressible loneliness of being. Yet he hoped for it anyway, and sought it endlessly. By the time he fell in love with Sarah Walker his longing for the realisation of this dream had grown acute. He was ripe for love, and fell hopelessly into it at the first faint, imagined touch of its presence. For 18 months after Sarah Walker's sinuous movements and meaningful looks captivated Hazlitt, she spent hours every day in his room, sitting on his knee, kissing and fondling him endlessly, and being fondled in return. He did not try to have sexual intercourse with her, because he idealised her and wanted to marry her, and therefore wished to believe her \"pure\". But their intimacy did not fall far short. During the first year he was often blissfully happy. She was \"the only woman that ever made me think she loved me, and that feeling was so new to me, and so delicious, that 'it will never from my heart' \" (sic). She made him think that she loved him without ever telling him so directly - on the contrary, she refused to say that she loved him, nor would she promise him anything for the future. When he asked, \"Do you love me? Could you love me?\" she merely said, \"You should judge by my actions\" and \"Do I seem indifferent?\" Indeed, her actions made Hazlitt hope, and hope was enough at the outset. He showered her with gifts, some of them expensive: an ivory flageolet, a gold heart-shaped locket, a cap and gown, silk cloth, tickets for the theatre, copies of the books he had written, even his most treasured miniature statue of Napoleon. But one day she told him something he had not known before. The reason she could never feel more than friendship towards him, she said, was that she still nurtured a tenderness for someone else, a former lodger in the house who, because of a \"difference of station\", had been obliged to leave to prevent their mutual feelings going further. This continuing attachment posed a barrier, she said, to her ever loving anyone else. This was a severe blow. Instead of answering his questions evasively, she was now, Hazlitt reported, saying, \"No, never.\" He was hurt and troubled by the news, but it did not kill his hope. He thought that his passion must surely one day make her love him in return, so exalted was it, and so profound. And then he found that he was charmed by her fidelity to one she had loved, and he honoured her for it. And still she sat in his lap daily, twining her arms round his neck, kissing him, enjoying his caresses. But that was before an even more devastating blow precipitated a crisis in their relationship. A new lodger arrived, younger and more handsome, and Sarah Walker discovered for herself what it was like to fall in love. She rejected Hazlitt therefore, and his suffering over the next three years is almost indescribable. He did everything he could to win her back, not least divorcing his estranged wife so that he could be free to marry Sarah; but it only prolonged his agony. Mary Shelley, the daughter of his friend Godwin, having not seen him during those years because she was in Italy, described his appearance when the crisis was nearly over: \"I never was so shocked in my life - gaunt and thin, his hair scattered, his cheekbones projecting - but for his voice and smile I should not have known him. His smile brought tears to my eyes, it was like a sunbeam illuminating the most melancholy of ruins.\" And yet in the years during and after Hazlitt's great passion for Sarah Walker, he wrote his best works - essays of incomparable power and beauty, exploring the human condition, discussing art and letters, dissecting ideas, offering instruction and wit, insight, controversy, and pleasure - and, in the most famous of his books, The Spirit of the Age, choosing with unerring accuracy those among his contemporaries whose reputations he thought would last into history, and anatomising them in his penetrating and witty way. As with everything he wrote, his genius as a writer of prose takes one's breath away, and leaves a vivid impression of a man whose passionately lived life was turned by great art into literature, and made a lasting monument to the human spirit. \u0095 AC Grayling's The Quarrel of the Age, a biography of Hazlitt, is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (\u00a325).

In amongst the rain and wind we visited holly trees and rowans before the backup force arrived. Now they are swooping and clattering, each day the holly berries diminish in number. Watching birds during these hard times you cannot help but be impressed by the neat ability of small birds to keep low and vanish into the shelter of any leaved bush. On one particularly lashed-about walk we sought some shelter by creeping under a low holly. Saved from wind and rain, we could catch our breath and look around. The ground was covered in berries torn from the tree: what will eat them down there? </p> <p>When we emerged we were dazzled by yet another rainbow. Days of non-stop rain become tedious, but the rainbows seen on showery days have been triumphant, soaring arcs of colour. Another delight is the varied hues of the tree leaves in sunshine. Oaks are providing rich marmalade while the beeches flame into gold.

In amongst the rain and wind we visited holly trees and rowans before the backup force arrived. Now they are swooping and clattering, each day the holly berries diminish in number. Watching birds during these hard times you cannot help but be impressed by the neat ability of small birds to keep low and vanish into the shelter of any leaved bush. On one particularly lashed-about walk we sought some shelter by creeping under a low holly. Saved from wind and rain, we could catch our breath and look around. The ground was covered in berries torn from the tree: what will eat them down there? When we emerged we were dazzled by yet another rainbow. Days of non-stop rain become tedious, but the rainbows seen on showery days have been triumphant, soaring arcs of colour. Another delight is the varied hues of the tree leaves in sunshine. Oaks are providing rich marmalade while the beeches flame into gold. Whether the sky is pale blue or dark indigo, behind them the trees sing, \"What if this life is full of care...\" Admittedly, if you stand around to stare in some places you may lose your boots.

When I make a mistake I will fix it.\" And as revealed this week, Arup plans to ease the swaying, if not stop it entirely, with a series of shock absorbers that will cost Arup some \u00a35m with extra costs for ongoing maintenance and close the bridge for six months. Mr Fitzpatrick says: \"In a situation like this there are a few rocks you need to cling on to and the main and only one you really need is 'always keep telling the truth.' \" Shakespeare knew what he was talking about - and so did Tony's mother.",

      "body": "<p>Plans to close hundreds of urban post offices have been put on hold as a result of the lengthy talks about setting up a PO-based universal bank. </p> <p>The government promised to compensate sub-postmasters who merged their businesses to create bigger, more viable, high street branches. </p> <p>But Colin Baker, the general secretary of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, yesterday said talks about compensation packages could not start until after the resolution of the universal bank issue. </p> <p>The universal bank, which will provide basic bank accounts for the financially excluded, is expected to restore about \u00a3150m of the \u00a3400m annual revenue post offices will lose when state benefits are paid directly into bank accounts, from 2003. </p> <p>But efforts to establish the new bank have been bogged down by the leading banks' opposition to the scheme and by divisions within Whitehall. </p> <p>Mr Baker said: \"Without the universal bank being nailed down, it would be a leap in the dark for sub-postmasters to merge their businesses. </p> <p>\"They need to know whether they will be getting the univer sal bank revenue and they need to know details of the compensation package. </p> <p>\"Without that knowledge, there is no chance of bigger, brighter and better urban post offices. It is time for the government to deliver on its promises,\" he said. </p> <p>Two post offices are closing every week - double last year's rate. The government knows closures of branches in rural and deprived urban areas are the most controversial because they usually lead to the closure of the only local shop. </p> <p>But it accepts there is a strong case for consolidation in commercially stronger urban areas, where there are often several post offices within walking distance of each other. </p> <p>A single, larger post office for the area would support a bigger shop and would provide the extra space for planned new post office businesses such as wider provision of government services, internet access, basic banking facilities and pick-up point for online purchases of retail goods. </p> <p>A small trial of an online purchases pick-up scheme started two weeks ago in the west country, albeit with weight limits on the items. </p> <p>\"In the first week there were 48 parcels, in the second 130 parcels, and it will be near 300 parcels in the third week,\" Mr Baker said. </p> <p>The Treasury believes paying benefit direct to bank accounts will save about \u00a3400m a year. But it is also encouraging banks to develop their own branded no frills accounts. </p> <p>The Department of Trade &amp; Industry, on the other hand, is backing the universal bank plan, in part because it would offset the impact of bank branch closures in rural areas and in part because it would help post offices survive. </p> <p>It has also undermined the Treasury stance by promising that people will still be able to receive benefits in cash at post offices. </p> <p>The banks do not see why they should financially support the universal bank, which they see as part of government social policy. They also believe it will carry the stigma of a \"poor people's bank\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Plans to close hundreds of urban post offices have been put on hold as a result of the lengthy talks about setting up a PO-based universal bank. The government promised to compensate sub-postmasters who merged their businesses to create bigger, more viable, high street branches. But Colin Baker, the general secretary of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, yesterday said talks about compensation packages could not start until after the resolution of the universal bank issue. The universal bank, which will provide basic bank accounts for the financially excluded, is expected to restore about \u00a3150m of the \u00a3400m annual revenue post offices will lose when state benefits are paid directly into bank accounts, from 2003. But efforts to establish the new bank have been bogged down by the leading banks' opposition to the scheme and by divisions within Whitehall. Mr Baker said: \"Without the universal bank being nailed down, it would be a leap in the dark for sub-postmasters to merge their businesses. \"They need to know whether they will be getting the univer sal bank revenue and they need to know details of the compensation package. \"Without that knowledge, there is no chance of bigger, brighter and better urban post offices. It is time for the government to deliver on its promises,\" he said. Two post offices are closing every week - double last year's rate. The government knows closures of branches in rural and deprived urban areas are the most controversial because they usually lead to the closure of the only local shop. But it accepts there is a strong case for consolidation in commercially stronger urban areas, where there are often several post offices within walking distance of each other. A single, larger post office for the area would support a bigger shop and would provide the extra space for planned new post office businesses such as wider provision of government services, internet access, basic banking facilities and pick-up point for online purchases of retail goods. A small trial of an online purchases pick-up scheme started two weeks ago in the west country, albeit with weight limits on the items. \"In the first week there were 48 parcels, in the second 130 parcels, and it will be near 300 parcels in the third week,\" Mr Baker said. The Treasury believes paying benefit direct to bank accounts will save about \u00a3400m a year. But it is also encouraging banks to develop their own branded no frills accounts. The Department of Trade &amp; Industry, on the other hand, is backing the universal bank plan, in part because it would offset the impact of bank branch closures in rural areas and in part because it would help post offices survive. It has also undermined the Treasury stance by promising that people will still be able to receive benefits in cash at post offices. The banks do not see why they should financially support the universal bank, which they see as part of government social policy. They also believe it will carry the stigma of a \"poor people's bank\".",

Chris Jones, the finance director, said the lower cost of capital brought about by issuing bonds could generate savings of between \u00a340m and \u00a350m, and some of this could be passed back to customers, with an initial cut of 5% likely around 2004-5. The company, which is aiming for an A credit rating, says it expects its revenues to be so steady that by the time of the next Ofwat review in 2005 that customers could look forward to annual rebates. \"Welsh Water bills are the second highest because of the extensive environmental investment programme,\" Mr Jones said. \"But by paying rebates we would hope to get them closer to the average - right in the middle of the pack.\" Glas Cymru hopes to be given Ofwat approval for its plans in January. Last week Philip Fletcher, the director general of water services, said that its plans \"do not appear to give rise to any insurmountable issues\", and is understood to be ready to give them the go-ahead after the formal consultation period.",

      "body": "<p>Voluptuous, delicious and mysterious: it's time to uncover the sensual face of Christianity. Tradition paints the churches as goody-goody worshippers of purity, strict adherents to a legacy of hair shirts and denials; but Christianity walks provocatively between the sinful and the celestial, and draws its beauty from rites that please the senses while promising to satisfy the spirit. This is a no-holds-barred religion that speaks easily of \"ecstasy\" and \"adoration\", and in superlatives such as \"King of kings\" and \"Holiest of Holies\". </p> <p>Even in our prosaic times, take part in a Christian ritual and you step into a world of wonders that celebrates what God gives rather than what He withholds; abundance, not abstinence, inspires our practices, colours our palette and strengthens our faith. I can shut my eyes and relish memories of certain Christian celebrations. Easter service in the Russian Orthodox cathedral in Washington DC, where the rich brocades of the altar cloth and the scarlet and gold-leaf icons blurred in the sweetly potent clouds of incense that filled my eyes, nose and lungs. A Sunday service in the Comoro Islands, in the Indian ocean, where villagers in boldly coloured cotton turbans and caftans fill the whitewashed, sun-filled church, swaying in the aisles as their voices rise in a joyous rendition of a Ladysmith Black Mambazo gospel song. A holy procession in the backstreets of Naples, where housewives at their windows cast down notes upon the pastel-coloured plaster Virgin that two black-haired altar boys carry between them. </p> <p>These rituals blend scent and colour, song and texture to celebrate life - not just here on earth, but beyond. Any attempt to define Christians today must pay homage to this rich beauty; to chronicle their world with a collection of black-and-white photographs is to short-change its technicolour brilliance. </p> <p>In his book The Faces Of Christianity: A Photographic Journey, Abbas, the Iranian-born photographer, does just this. The gently glowing gaze of a Benedictine monk in Fleury and the serene beauty of a young mother, her baby at her breast, dressed up as Madonna and Child in a pilgrimage in Mexico City: these are the images that for Abbas define the Christian aesthetic - an aesthetic he views as rooted, predictably, in serenity and innocence. His \"photographic journey\" is often one of sombre beauty. The rites he records and the people he depicts are appealing, and often haunting; but to hem in Christianity by duotoned piety is to misrepresent it. </p> <p>Nothing new in that. Ever since the carpenter's son started agitating for change almost 2,000 years ago, his message has been twisted or manipulated, and his followers have been made into scapegoats.

When their husbands died, my great aunts, then in their 50s, decided to return to their native village and share a house there. In that small Italian village, the two childless women, who had neither a husband nor a fortune to ensure their status, found their identity in their faith. Their Mass attendance (every morning and on Sundays), their membership in the rosary group (which used to pray before the little shrine of San Rocco, the village patron saint, once a month), the endless dinners they offered the parish priest, gave their lives form and substance - and placed them squarely within the village hierarchy (one rung below Signora Gandini, who was married and who had paid for the stained-glass window in the church; one rung above the baker, Rina, who was married and had children, but who never gave more than a few coins to the Sunday collection). </p> <p>Their religion rooted my aunts in a clearly defined spiritual space as well. They had no doubt that there was life after death, and that they fitted into a divine scheme whose confines were the glorious bliss of heaven and the terrible torment of hell. My great aunts' certainty is echoed in many of the Christians whom Abbas encounters: from the evangelical enthusiasm of the born-agains to the deep-seated calm of the village elders who accept without question all that He brings them, there are endless witnesses to the soothing strength of faith. </p> <p>I suspect that, like my aunts, these men and women never suffer the existential fears that characterise so many secular lives today. And their example suggests that our state of almost perpetual anxiety stems from our questioning the spiritual order that they accept unblinkingly. We feel vulnerable because we have turned our back on their ancient Christian atlas, which placed us in a universe in which God was firmly in the heavens above; and in the midst of a life that stretched into eternity. </p> <p>In our harsh new world, instead, we doubt the presence of a guiding spirit, and that our existence goes beyond the here and now. We play out our lives against a backdrop that has been reduced from the eternal to the earthbound. Boxed in this new, man-made landscape, we peer at a world where everything looms larger and more menacing - where talk of a fuel shortage produces chaos, and the sight of a flooded city panic. There is not much room here - as the two young boys who murdered James Bulger have discovered - for forgiveness or the possibility of redemption. And who can blame us?

      "bodyText": "Voluptuous, delicious and mysterious: it's time to uncover the sensual face of Christianity. Tradition paints the churches as goody-goody worshippers of purity, strict adherents to a legacy of hair shirts and denials; but Christianity walks provocatively between the sinful and the celestial, and draws its beauty from rites that please the senses while promising to satisfy the spirit. This is a no-holds-barred religion that speaks easily of \"ecstasy\" and \"adoration\", and in superlatives such as \"King of kings\" and \"Holiest of Holies\". Even in our prosaic times, take part in a Christian ritual and you step into a world of wonders that celebrates what God gives rather than what He withholds; abundance, not abstinence, inspires our practices, colours our palette and strengthens our faith. I can shut my eyes and relish memories of certain Christian celebrations. Easter service in the Russian Orthodox cathedral in Washington DC, where the rich brocades of the altar cloth and the scarlet and gold-leaf icons blurred in the sweetly potent clouds of incense that filled my eyes, nose and lungs. A Sunday service in the Comoro Islands, in the Indian ocean, where villagers in boldly coloured cotton turbans and caftans fill the whitewashed, sun-filled church, swaying in the aisles as their voices rise in a joyous rendition of a Ladysmith Black Mambazo gospel song. A holy procession in the backstreets of Naples, where housewives at their windows cast down notes upon the pastel-coloured plaster Virgin that two black-haired altar boys carry between them. These rituals blend scent and colour, song and texture to celebrate life - not just here on earth, but beyond. Any attempt to define Christians today must pay homage to this rich beauty; to chronicle their world with a collection of black-and-white photographs is to short-change its technicolour brilliance. In his book The Faces Of Christianity: A Photographic Journey, Abbas, the Iranian-born photographer, does just this. The gently glowing gaze of a Benedictine monk in Fleury and the serene beauty of a young mother, her baby at her breast, dressed up as Madonna and Child in a pilgrimage in Mexico City: these are the images that for Abbas define the Christian aesthetic - an aesthetic he views as rooted, predictably, in serenity and innocence. His \"photographic journey\" is often one of sombre beauty. The rites he records and the people he depicts are appealing, and often haunting; but to hem in Christianity by duotoned piety is to misrepresent it. Nothing new in that. Ever since the carpenter's son started agitating for change almost 2,000 years ago, his message has been twisted or manipulated, and his followers have been made into scapegoats. Yet if history is a catalogue of attacks on Christianity, to this day the religion holds us in thrall, informing our laws and social code, our education and the arts. The story of Jesus Christ remains our single greatest narrative; Christian signposts - from Genesis through the Garden of Eden, from his birth to his crucifixion and resurrection - are familiar to believers and unbelievers alike; Christian symbols - the cross, the communion wafer, the fish - instantly recognisable. In terms of branding, Christianity is up there with Coca-Cola, Walt Disney and Gap - but it will not subside into mood music, or a pair of Mickey Mouse ears we can pick up and wear to entertain. Even today, snug in an atheism that has become commonplace, we come across Christians who give us pause for thought and leave us wondering whether Freud, Nietzsche and Russell really did get it right. A young volunteer, sitting on the floor of a Catholic home for the disabled, feeding a handicapped child whose head rests in her lap; a middle-aged missionary, who lives and works alongside the villagers in remote Senedongo, Mali, celebrating an al fresco Mass at a makeshift altar of straw; a monk helping Serb refugees in Kosovo load a lorry with their belongings as they prepare to set off on their lives of exile: even two-dimensional and on a page, their wordless sacrifices are unsettling, for the nurses, schoolchildren and farmers, as well as the nuns and priests, whom we see through Abbas's lens, are busy turning our world upside down. The outcast is embraced, the marginalised moved centre-stage, the voiceless given a megaphone. These subversives are working for a truly \"inclusive society\": forget the political catchphrase peddled from podiums in Bournemouth and Brighton - theirs is the real thing, an uncomfortable, relentless quest to place others above me-myself-and-I. It's an outrageous message that goes against the grain: don't seek the successful, the A-list celebs, the profit motive or the bottom line; look out, instead, for the weak and the misfit, for the occasion to give everything and to love without bounds. No wonder Christianity is so unpopular. To paraphrase GK Chesterton, it has been tried, and found too damned difficult. And too damned irreverent. Christians, like the little boy who told the Emperor he was naked, are forever puncturing our self-importance, hinting that, actually, there is something missing from our lives. That connection with others, the reaching out to the less fortunate, this is their imperative - one that, in the west at least, sounds so foreign now. Foreign, but also alluring, as Abbas - who in the text accompanying his photographs labels himself a \"Shiite Muslim sceptic\" - clearly shows. He is at once intrigued and impressed by the do-gooders' silent protest at our selfish ways; the heroes of his book are the volunteers who work with the disabled in Lourdes or the malnourished in Mali. His lens rests lovingly on their figures, captures the compassion in their gaze, turns even their pedestrian activities - sharing a meal, packing a lorry - into lyrical statements of a profound humanity. Onward, Christian soldiers, has always been the churches' marching order - and its Bible-thumping troops have obeyed and colonised the globe. As a result, the world has been transformed; but Christianity, too, has changed its accent, if not its language. From Egypt to Mexico to South Korea, the native communities that have embraced this religion have coloured it with their home-grown rites and rituals - and even superstitions.

      "body": "<p>Perhaps Oscar Wilde lived up to his own dictum: \"One should either be a work of art, or wear a work of art.\" Lady Ottoline Morrell, renowned hostess, muse and patron of artists, pacifist and bohemian, achieved both. Six foot tall, with reams of copper-red hair, turquoise eyes, a long nose and jutting jaw, she wore clothes that had little to do with fashion but everything to do with originality.</p> <p>So memorable was she that she featured in several works of fiction, including Aldous Huxley's Crome Yellow and DH Lawrence's Women In Love. She also inspired many artists, particularly Augustus John. Her own passion was for clothes - distinctive, sumptuous, relating as much to the baroque styles of her aristocratic ancestors as they did to the Edwardian fashions of her day. The Museum of Costume in Bath recently acquired much of her wardrobe - the archive of her dress and accessories - which illuminates not only her character but also an aspect of the dress of a section of society who made anti-fashion part of their identity.</p> <p>\"Bohemia is the name for the attempt by 19th- and 20th-century artists, writers, intellectuals and radicals to create an alternative world within western society... a social milieu created against the dominant culture,\" writes cultural historian Elizabeth Wilson in her riveting Bohemians: The Glamorous Outcasts. The Morrell collection now at Bath represents a sartorial attempt to create an alternative world.</p> <p>\"It is very exciting because it has given us the opportunity to study bohemian dress, an important area that has hitherto been rather neglected,\" says Rosemary Harden of the Costume Museum, who has catalogued the collection and is very enthusiastic about Ottoline. \"She was an important figure in cultural life in the earlier 20th century, when bohemianism was more than just a hippy, Thea Porter aesthetic.\" About 600 pieces of clothing, accessories and miscellaneous textiles and objects were bought from Ottoline's grandson, Adrian Goodman, in March this year, having been carefully preserved for over 60 years by his mother, Julian Goodman.</p> <p>What emerges from the collection is an indication that Ottoline Morrell was glamorous, idiosyncratic and elegant: not the mad, rather grungy eccentric we have been led to believe. From her death in 1938 until the publication of her biography by Miranda Seymour - Ottoline Morrell, Life On a Grand Scale (1992) - Morrell has been seen through what Seymour calls the \"distorting\" eyes of the Bloomsbury Group in their copious letters, diaries and memoirs. \"Her beauty was forgotten, her religious faith belittled and her generosity derided.\"</p> <p>She had sunk from being one of the most remarkable and influential women of her time to the level of caricature: \"It is like sitting beneath an arum lily; with a thick golden bar in the middle,\" wrote Virginia Woolf in 1907, \"dropping pollen, or whatever that is which seduces the male bee.\" She undoubtedly irritated and probably offended people. What is of especial interest now that the collection has come to light is how the clothes are not entirely bohemian. They bear little relation to the Gypsy-style dress of Dorelia John or the arts-and-crafts aesthetic style of Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf, and there is only one example from the Omega Workshops of Bell and Roger Fry at Bath. Ottoline did not fit into her own background or adopted milieu so she made herself unique: \"An artistic object for display and consumption,\" as Seymour puts it.</p> <p>Morrell did not believe that she was beautiful; instead, she became extraordinary. Wearing shoes with two-inch soles and six-inch heels, she exaggerated her height and hennaed her already auburn hair. Only later did she recognise that her compulsion to present such a dramatic appearance made her more isolated: \"It's no fun being an oddity for it makes one eternally lonely,\" she wrote in her diary. \"Unfortunately, I combine being an oddity with being very proud, and that makes one aloof.\"</p> <p>Ottoline Cavendish-Bentinck belonged to the world of aristocratic privilege, to a family at once conventional and eccentric. Born in 1873, she was the youngest child and only daughter of General Arthur Cavendish-Bentinck, heir to the mysterious fifth Duke of Portland. Her mother Augusta was Irish and instilled in Ottoline a strong religious faith, a love of beautiful clothes and the importance of being an exceptional hostess. Their lives changed when (the general having died) Ottoline's half-brother Arthur inherited the dukedom in 1879 and the family moved to Welbeck, the ancestral home of the Portlands. Aged six, she became Lady Ottoline and entered a world of history and fantasy.</p> <p>There was a touch of the Gormenghast to Welbeck. The fifth duke had been a recluse. To avoid being seen, he had mined into the foundations of the house, constructing tunnels and rooms, including a magnificent underground riding school lined with chandeliers. There was great excitement as the children explored the place, but what appeared to have the greatest influence on Ottoline was the discovery of family portraits.</p> <p>\"Stacked here were all the pictures belonging to the house - pictures that had come down from generation to generation, but taken out of their frames and set up two or three deep,\" she wrote. \"My love of history was first stimulated by gazing at these old paintings, portraits of the courtiers of James I's court, so elegant and lovely and sentimental, with pearls in their ears and long trailing lovelocks of golden hair hanging over their collars, and of ladies whom they loved, with very low cut dresses, showing pearly breasts, and embroidered skirts and exquisite shoes... portraits of the Countess of Essex who had poisoned Overbury; of Louis XIV... of Charles I... dressed in a green velvet doublet and skirt, with a sad pale face... of pale Arabella Stuart, who had been imprisoned nearby at Bolsover Castle. A small picture of Mary Queen of Scots, who soon became my dearest friend - the exquisite face with a pearl drop on her forehead, and a fine gold cap over her small head - I used to visit very often.\"</p> <p>The place was imbued with romance; she found a portrait of the matriarch Bess of Hardwick, Mary's gaoler and the grandmother of the tragic Arabella. The discovery of her ancestor Margaret Lucas, Duchess of Newcastle, the poet, playwright and would-be philosopher whose eccentric appearance fascinated the Restoration court, was not just inspiring: the child identified with her and her later grand style was testament to their connection. \"Perhaps, after all, I belonged to the time of hoops and loops and billowing skirts - a rare survival.\"</p> <p>Clothes for Ottoline had always been an obsession; her earliest memory is of bursting into tears because her brothers said a dress made her look fat. When she was four, she was given a pair of black dogskin gloves by her father, which she treasured until death. Some 250 years before her birth, the Duchess of Newcastle, as Virginia Woolf wrote in The Common Reader, had been a believer in fairies, pondered the nature of the universe, worried about cruelty to animals, placed intelligence over fashion.</p> <p>\"All I desire is fame,\" the great lady said - and she got it, primarily through sensationally individual clothes. \"I took great delight in attiring, fine dress and fashions, especially such fashions as I did invent myself, not taking that pleasure in such fashions as were invented by others: also I did dislike that any should follow my fashion, for I always took great delight in a singularity, even in accoutrements.\"</p> <p>This was a blueprint for Ottoline, and Osbert Sitwell drew the comparison in his Laughter In The Next Room. \"With her mass of chestnut hair falling on each side of her face, with her emphatic features, and wearing a yellow gown with a very wide skirt... there was something, too, in her appearance that recalled the portraits of her remarkable ancestress Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle... her way of looking, talking, thinking, her magnificent manner of dressing, her brocades and silks, [were] as natural to her as tweeds to the owner of a fox-terrier.\"</p> <p>She married the young solicitor Philip Morrell in 1902. They honeymooned in Italy, and there is a memorable account by Mary Berenson of the bride at Orvieto railway station: \"A tall drooping figure in a fur coat and low neck hung all over with jewels and crowned by an immense poke bonnet, on which nodded and trembled an immense array of ribbons and funeral feathers and ends of lace.\"</p> <p>Later, Ottoline described herself at this time as \"very earnest, full of potentialities, large and unfinished\". Morrell became the Liberal MP for South Oxfordshire and later Burnley, shared his wife's pacifism and her interest in art and literature. The Morrells had twins, a boy and a girl, whom they named Julian. The boy died as a baby; the loss of her son was something Ottoline never really recovered from, and it was to create long-lasting difficulties in her relationship with her daughter. Devastated, the Morrells moved to 44 Bedford Square, Bloomsbury, and from 1907 onwards Ottoline threw her energies into a salon, held in two rooms on Thursday evenings.</p> <p>Her aim as hostess was to invite writers and artists to meet possible patrons, with food and drink, music, talking and dancing. In one room were the artists, in the other the \"sedate talkers\" such as Henry James and Herbert Asquith. \"I rigidly did not invite the smart or fashionable world,\" she explained. \"When one or two stray ones crept in, they upset the harmony and unselfconscious gaiety of the others.\"</p> <p>For the next 30 years, at Garsington Manor, Oxfordshire, where she lived from 1915 to 1928, and then at 10 Gower Street, Ottoline was a notable hostess to a variety of people that ranged from James and Asquith to Augustus John and Bertrand Russell, TS Eliot and DH Lawrence to Nijinsky and Diaghilev, Lytton Strachey and Virginia Woolf to Charlie Chaplin. \"Conventionality is deadness,\" she wrote in her diary in 1915. She had found her vocation - \"to live,\" says Seymour, \"a life of active benevolence outside the conventions.\"</p> <p>Virginia Woolf wrote of Ottoline to her sister Vanessa in 1917 that she had been \"so overcome by her beauty that I really felt as if I'd suddenly got into the sea, and heard the mermaids fluting on the rocks\". She was an unconventional model for Duncan Grant (who portrayed her as a bird of paradise), Henry Lamb, Simon Bussy, Charles Conder, Augustus John and Dorothy Brett, dressing in clothes inspired by portraits she saw in galleries. \"When I see old Italian or Flemish pictures, or modern French or English ones, I know that what they express to me is some individual vision of the world.\" This individual vision was what she strove to express to the world in dress.</p> <p>\"She was compulsive,\" Harden, Bath's keeper of collections, believes, \"a compulsive hostess, compulsive dresser, compulsive shopper.\" And compulsive about her appearance - she admitted she looked \"rather gorgeous\" in 1920 after buying rich yellow fabric to make a dress with a neckline like a \"Tudor king's jacket\".</p> <p>Siegfried Sassoon wrote of their first meeting, with Oscar Wilde's friend Robbie Hoss, at Garsington in 1916: \"Always original in her style of dress, which was often extremely beautiful, she happened... to be wearing voluminous pale-pink Turkish trousers... It would have made all the difference to me if she had managed to look a bit more like Rossetti's Blessed Damozel.\"</p> <p>Although Ottoline belonged to a grand family, she and her husband were not rich but \"comfortable\". As time went on, they became less so. Almost from the start of the Ottoline myth, she could not afford the couturiers, like Fortuny and Poiret, who would have particularly appealed to her. Instead, her clothes were homemade, a collaboration with her maid, Miss Brenton. Ottoline would have an idea, often inspired by portraits she had seen, and a postcard would be presented to \"Brenty\". Fabrics were often antique silks bought on bargain- hunting expeditions, exotic material from the east or ecclesiastical fabrics that had the right historical look. She had excellent taste in colour and would choose beautiful muted pinks, golds and yellows, inspired by the colours of Bolsover.</p> <p>Brenty was no pushover, however, and seems to have exerted some control. \"I think the postcard very quaint and pretty but not the style for you,\" she said on one occasion; and on another, \"It is so difficult to keep out of the fashions as the narrow frocks do suit you so much, but we must make our things quaint and unusual by the colouring or embroidering.\"</p> <p>The intention was therefore not to be fashionable, but original. In 1913, Ottoline visited Joseph Conrad, wearing a blue Persian jacket over a lavender silk dress having been told that the writer would appreciate a note of \"fantasy\". \"How beautiful your wife looks in her colours against the green,\" Conrad told Philip Morrell. Yet she kicked against her own creation, saying that she struggled to express her \"wild artistic bohemian side\" to a world that only noticed her dress and colour sense.</p> <p>So while she enjoyed creating an image, she was also deeply frustrated - that she was not a writer, artist, philosopher or politician, a person without a vote for more than half a lifetime. This frustration was explored by DH Lawrence in her most famous literary appearance as Hermione Roddice in Women In Love, published in 1920.</p> <p>His portrayal was perceptive and not entirely hostile: \"Now she came along, with her head held up, balancing an enormous flat hat of pale yellow velvet, on which were streaks of ostrich feathers, natural and grey... She wore a dress of silky, frail velvet, of pale yellow colour, and she carried a lot of small, rose-coloured cyclamens. Her shoes and stockings were of brownish grey, like the feathers on her hat; her hair was heavy; she drifted along with a peculiar fixity of the hips, a strange unwilling motion. She was impressive, in her lovely pale-yellow and brownish-rose, yet macabre, something repulsive.\"</p> <p>Ottoline felt that it was a devastating betrayal of friendship, but interestingly was specifically angry with him for casting her as an ubiquitous \"Liberty mannequin... an awful aesthetic Grosvenor Gallery woman\". By representing her as a clotheshorse, however aesthetic, he had made her seem useless. Ottoline was a consummate stylist and Lawrence understood that her inspiration was from a romantic past: \"So to the steps up the porch... and into the interior, fragrant with all the memories of old age, and of by-gone, remembered lustiness,\" he wrote to her of Garsington in 1915.</p> <p>Augustus John noted perceptively in Chiaroscuro that, \"in spite of a dull and conventional upbringing, this fine woman was always prepared to do battle for Culture, Freedom and the People\".</p> <p>Harden admits that she was surprised the first time that she saw the collection: \"I'd read about her and knew her to be an eccentric with an extraordinary dress sense,\" she says. \"But however unique one of her dresses might be, it always relates in some way to a contemporary fashion system.\"</p> <p>In the museum's collection, the wedding dress in ivory satin is conventional. There is a dress in muted pink damask that could be inspired by quattrocento painting yet reflects the work of the then fashionable Fortuny. Her trademark puffed sleeves, not Edwardian \"leg of mutton\" but of the mid-17th century, appear in the early 20s, but all the dresses have the dropped waists of the period.</p> <p>There is a bias-cut frock, very Gertrude Lawrence, in silver lam\u00e9 brocade from the 30s, which would have been absolutely conventional bar the sleeves. A saffron 19th-century silk bodice and skirt that was worn in her portrait by Cecil Beaton for Vogue seems a homage to her forbear, the Duchess of Newcastle. But there is evidence of her conventional side in a mid-30s blue dress from Peter Jones and, importantly, there is a black satin evening dress by Neil \"Bunny\" Roger, the couturier, dandy and very grand homosexual, from late in her life.</p> <p>As she grew older, Morrell became less extreme; returning home from George V's Jubilee celebrations in 1930, she told her friend Robert Gathorne-Hardy brightly, \"Did you know? They mistook me for a maypole. They tried to dance round me.\" It is not that all the dresses look peculiar, says Penelope Ruddock, the museum's curator, \"it was the way that she put things together and wore them\".</p> <p>Most exciting is to discover that some of the clothes she wore in portraits painted of her are in this collection. There is a black silk velvet dress with a square neckline edged with seed pearls and beads, for instance. Dress historian Professor Aileen Ribeiro of the Courtauld Institute of Art believes it to be the dress worn in the Augustus John of 1919, held by the National Portrait Gallery. \"The artist was - understandably perhaps - worried about his sitter's reaction to the portrait, hoping that she would not find it ill-natured,\" writes Ribeiro in the excellent Gallery Of Fashion.</p> <p>It has the Tudor neckline that Ottoline favoured at the time, and the hat in the painting is thought to be one of the big slouch hats on show at Bath. It can, of course, be compared to the broad-brimmed, plumed hats worn by stylish members of the court of Charles I; the Duchess of Newcastle was lady-in-waiting to the Queen. Ottoline has the bravura of a pre-Commonwealth courtier from the \"time of hoops and loops and billowing skirts\".</p> <p>The historian David Cecil, a friend to Ottoline, described her as \"a princess of the Renaissance risen to shame our drab age\". In a postscript to the 1998 edition of the biography, Seymour has written of a sexual element to her relationship with her half-brother, the sixth Duke of Portland, that became evident in her diaries in 1932 and may have lasted until her death in 1938. \"It is degrading,\" she wrote. Also extraordinary, and unpublished, is the fact that the duke would get her to dress up in his wife's gowns by Worth. He had always been embarrassed by Ottoline's \"old clothes\".</p> <p>Was this now a final humiliation, to make her \"look presentable\" in couture, or did she tolerate his foibles, knowing only too well the power of dress to inspire and arouse?</p> <p>\"Ought I always to keep my eyes from looking at kingfishers and dragonflies and peacocks, and rest them only on jackdaws and crows?\" she wondered. With her courage, her dragonfly yellows and kingfisher greens, Ottoline was never a mere fashion victim. She deserves to be reassessed as a pioneer in the development of original style - Leigh Bowery, Vivienne Westwood, Isabella Blow and John Galliano are her descendants.</p> <p>\u0095 The Museum of Costume at the Assembly Rooms in Bath is currently preparing an exhibition of the Morrell collection, which is still being catalougued and researched.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps Oscar Wilde lived up to his own dictum: \"One should either be a work of art, or wear a work of art.\" Lady Ottoline Morrell, renowned hostess, muse and patron of artists, pacifist and bohemian, achieved both. Six foot tall, with reams of copper-red hair, turquoise eyes, a long nose and jutting jaw, she wore clothes that had little to do with fashion but everything to do with originality. So memorable was she that she featured in several works of fiction, including Aldous Huxley's Crome Yellow and DH Lawrence's Women In Love. She also inspired many artists, particularly Augustus John. Her own passion was for clothes - distinctive, sumptuous, relating as much to the baroque styles of her aristocratic ancestors as they did to the Edwardian fashions of her day. The Museum of Costume in Bath recently acquired much of her wardrobe - the archive of her dress and accessories - which illuminates not only her character but also an aspect of the dress of a section of society who made anti-fashion part of their identity. \"Bohemia is the name for the attempt by 19th- and 20th-century artists, writers, intellectuals and radicals to create an alternative world within western society... a social milieu created against the dominant culture,\" writes cultural historian Elizabeth Wilson in her riveting Bohemians: The Glamorous Outcasts. The Morrell collection now at Bath represents a sartorial attempt to create an alternative world. \"It is very exciting because it has given us the opportunity to study bohemian dress, an important area that has hitherto been rather neglected,\" says Rosemary Harden of the Costume Museum, who has catalogued the collection and is very enthusiastic about Ottoline. \"She was an important figure in cultural life in the earlier 20th century, when bohemianism was more than just a hippy, Thea Porter aesthetic.\" About 600 pieces of clothing, accessories and miscellaneous textiles and objects were bought from Ottoline's grandson, Adrian Goodman, in March this year, having been carefully preserved for over 60 years by his mother, Julian Goodman. What emerges from the collection is an indication that Ottoline Morrell was glamorous, idiosyncratic and elegant: not the mad, rather grungy eccentric we have been led to believe. From her death in 1938 until the publication of her biography by Miranda Seymour - Ottoline Morrell, Life On a Grand Scale (1992) - Morrell has been seen through what Seymour calls the \"distorting\" eyes of the Bloomsbury Group in their copious letters, diaries and memoirs. \"Her beauty was forgotten, her religious faith belittled and her generosity derided.\" She had sunk from being one of the most remarkable and influential women of her time to the level of caricature: \"It is like sitting beneath an arum lily; with a thick golden bar in the middle,\" wrote Virginia Woolf in 1907, \"dropping pollen, or whatever that is which seduces the male bee.\" She undoubtedly irritated and probably offended people. What is of especial interest now that the collection has come to light is how the clothes are not entirely bohemian. They bear little relation to the Gypsy-style dress of Dorelia John or the arts-and-crafts aesthetic style of Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf, and there is only one example from the Omega Workshops of Bell and Roger Fry at Bath. Ottoline did not fit into her own background or adopted milieu so she made herself unique: \"An artistic object for display and consumption,\" as Seymour puts it. Morrell did not believe that she was beautiful; instead, she became extraordinary. Wearing shoes with two-inch soles and six-inch heels, she exaggerated her height and hennaed her already auburn hair. Only later did she recognise that her compulsion to present such a dramatic appearance made her more isolated: \"It's no fun being an oddity for it makes one eternally lonely,\" she wrote in her diary. \"Unfortunately, I combine being an oddity with being very proud, and that makes one aloof.\" Ottoline Cavendish-Bentinck belonged to the world of aristocratic privilege, to a family at once conventional and eccentric. Born in 1873, she was the youngest child and only daughter of General Arthur Cavendish-Bentinck, heir to the mysterious fifth Duke of Portland. Her mother Augusta was Irish and instilled in Ottoline a strong religious faith, a love of beautiful clothes and the importance of being an exceptional hostess. Their lives changed when (the general having died) Ottoline's half-brother Arthur inherited the dukedom in 1879 and the family moved to Welbeck, the ancestral home of the Portlands. Aged six, she became Lady Ottoline and entered a world of history and fantasy. There was a touch of the Gormenghast to Welbeck. The fifth duke had been a recluse. To avoid being seen, he had mined into the foundations of the house, constructing tunnels and rooms, including a magnificent underground riding school lined with chandeliers. There was great excitement as the children explored the place, but what appeared to have the greatest influence on Ottoline was the discovery of family portraits. \"Stacked here were all the pictures belonging to the house - pictures that had come down from generation to generation, but taken out of their frames and set up two or three deep,\" she wrote. \"My love of history was first stimulated by gazing at these old paintings, portraits of the courtiers of James I's court, so elegant and lovely and sentimental, with pearls in their ears and long trailing lovelocks of golden hair hanging over their collars, and of ladies whom they loved, with very low cut dresses, showing pearly breasts, and embroidered skirts and exquisite shoes... portraits of the Countess of Essex who had poisoned Overbury; of Louis XIV... of Charles I... dressed in a green velvet doublet and skirt, with a sad pale face... of pale Arabella Stuart, who had been imprisoned nearby at Bolsover Castle. A small picture of Mary Queen of Scots, who soon became my dearest friend - the exquisite face with a pearl drop on her forehead, and a fine gold cap over her small head - I used to visit very often.\" The place was imbued with romance; she found a portrait of the matriarch Bess of Hardwick, Mary's gaoler and the grandmother of the tragic Arabella. The discovery of her ancestor Margaret Lucas, Duchess of Newcastle, the poet, playwright and would-be philosopher whose eccentric appearance fascinated the Restoration court, was not just inspiring: the child identified with her and her later grand style was testament to their connection. \"Perhaps, after all, I belonged to the time of hoops and loops and billowing skirts - a rare survival.\" Clothes for Ottoline had always been an obsession; her earliest memory is of bursting into tears because her brothers said a dress made her look fat. When she was four, she was given a pair of black dogskin gloves by her father, which she treasured until death. Some 250 years before her birth, the Duchess of Newcastle, as Virginia Woolf wrote in The Common Reader, had been a believer in fairies, pondered the nature of the universe, worried about cruelty to animals, placed intelligence over fashion. \"All I desire is fame,\" the great lady said - and she got it, primarily through sensationally individual clothes. \"I took great delight in attiring, fine dress and fashions, especially such fashions as I did invent myself, not taking that pleasure in such fashions as were invented by others: also I did dislike that any should follow my fashion, for I always took great delight in a singularity, even in accoutrements.\" This was a blueprint for Ottoline, and Osbert Sitwell drew the comparison in his Laughter In The Next Room. \"With her mass of chestnut hair falling on each side of her face, with her emphatic features, and wearing a yellow gown with a very wide skirt... there was something, too, in her appearance that recalled the portraits of her remarkable ancestress Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle... her way of looking, talking, thinking, her magnificent manner of dressing, her brocades and silks, [were] as natural to her as tweeds to the owner of a fox-terrier.\" She married the young solicitor Philip Morrell in 1902. They honeymooned in Italy, and there is a memorable account by Mary Berenson of the bride at Orvieto railway station: \"A tall drooping figure in a fur coat and low neck hung all over with jewels and crowned by an immense poke bonnet, on which nodded and trembled an immense array of ribbons and funeral feathers and ends of lace.\" Later, Ottoline described herself at this time as \"very earnest, full of potentialities, large and unfinished\". Morrell became the Liberal MP for South Oxfordshire and later Burnley, shared his wife's pacifism and her interest in art and literature. The Morrells had twins, a boy and a girl, whom they named Julian. The boy died as a baby; the loss of her son was something Ottoline never really recovered from, and it was to create long-lasting difficulties in her relationship with her daughter. Devastated, the Morrells moved to 44 Bedford Square, Bloomsbury, and from 1907 onwards Ottoline threw her energies into a salon, held in two rooms on Thursday evenings. Her aim as hostess was to invite writers and artists to meet possible patrons, with food and drink, music, talking and dancing. In one room were the artists, in the other the \"sedate talkers\" such as Henry James and Herbert Asquith. \"I rigidly did not invite the smart or fashionable world,\" she explained. \"When one or two stray ones crept in, they upset the harmony and unselfconscious gaiety of the others.\" For the next 30 years, at Garsington Manor, Oxfordshire, where she lived from 1915 to 1928, and then at 10 Gower Street, Ottoline was a notable hostess to a variety of people that ranged from James and Asquith to Augustus John and Bertrand Russell, TS Eliot and DH Lawrence to Nijinsky and Diaghilev, Lytton Strachey and Virginia Woolf to Charlie Chaplin. \"Conventionality is deadness,\" she wrote in her diary in 1915. She had found her vocation - \"to live,\" says Seymour, \"a life of active benevolence outside the conventions.\" Virginia Woolf wrote of Ottoline to her sister Vanessa in 1917 that she had been \"so overcome by her beauty that I really felt as if I'd suddenly got into the sea, and heard the mermaids fluting on the rocks\". She was an unconventional model for Duncan Grant (who portrayed her as a bird of paradise), Henry Lamb, Simon Bussy, Charles Conder, Augustus John and Dorothy Brett, dressing in clothes inspired by portraits she saw in galleries. \"When I see old Italian or Flemish pictures, or modern French or English ones, I know that what they express to me is some individual vision of the world.\" This individual vision was what she strove to express to the world in dress. \"She was compulsive,\" Harden, Bath's keeper of collections, believes, \"a compulsive hostess, compulsive dresser, compulsive shopper.\" And compulsive about her appearance - she admitted she looked \"rather gorgeous\" in 1920 after buying rich yellow fabric to make a dress with a neckline like a \"Tudor king's jacket\". Siegfried Sassoon wrote of their first meeting, with Oscar Wilde's friend Robbie Hoss, at Garsington in 1916: \"Always original in her style of dress, which was often extremely beautiful, she happened... to be wearing voluminous pale-pink Turkish trousers... It would have made all the difference to me if she had managed to look a bit more like Rossetti's Blessed Damozel.\" Although Ottoline belonged to a grand family, she and her husband were not rich but \"comfortable\".

She had excellent taste in colour and would choose beautiful muted pinks, golds and yellows, inspired by the colours of Bolsover. Brenty was no pushover, however, and seems to have exerted some control. \"I think the postcard very quaint and pretty but not the style for you,\" she said on one occasion; and on another, \"It is so difficult to keep out of the fashions as the narrow frocks do suit you so much, but we must make our things quaint and unusual by the colouring or embroidering.\" The intention was therefore not to be fashionable, but original.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes I think that Thanksgiving is an event conjured up by Hollywood in lavish, homely mode - somewhere between Meet Me In St Louis and Little Women. It is staged every year, ostensibly to banish all ill will and allow peace to prevail. It seems a day made up almost entirely of quaint ritual and food - lots and lots of food. And such food, too: roast turkey, a month before Christmas; corn bread; sweet potatoes cooked with marshmallow. Frankly, it all seems most odd. Charming, but odd.</p> <p>But then I am just a Brit, one of a dull crowd who do Christmas and, God help us, New Year under duress. Christmas is crabbed by guilt, commercialism and general excess. It has become shorn of its emotional trappings. But to an American, Thanksgiving Day is a complete surrender of hearth, home and hooch to kith and kin from any and all points of the compass. It is an event that travels in the heart and soul of Americans - wherever they may be, the fourth Thursday in November is dedicated to celebrating the survival of the Pilgrim Fathers through their first year on the continent in 1621.</p> <p>But it hasn't always been the fourth Thursday in November. In fact, the first ever Thanksgiving was in October, when the pilgrims sat down to a feast that they had prepared for their native American benefactors, without whose kindly aid they might well all have perished. Indeed, in Canada, Thanksgiving is still celebrated on the second Monday of October.</p> <p>Most of the implements, seeds and experience that the pilgrims brought with them were redundant in this new world, and the huts that they built were scant protection against a climate that was savagely cold and relentless compared with the mild, damp English winters they were used to.</p> <p>Thanksgiving then disappeared off the official agenda for some 200 years, until 1863 when Abraham Lincoln was persuaded to set aside the last Thursday in November for celebration, at least in part due to a campaign orchestrated by the formidable Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of Godey's Lady's Book.</p> <p>The date was changed to the fourth Thursday in November (you may well ask how many Thursdays can there be in a single month) by President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1939, when he succumbed to the arguments of Federated Department Stores boss, Fred Lazarus Jr, who pointed out that Thanksgiving Day ushered in the Christmas season, and that a longer Yuletide shopathon would be good for the economy.</p> <p>As we can assume that what was good for the economy was also good for Federated's stores, the story of the changing dates of Thanksgiving Day neatly encapsulates the American belief that you can worship God and Mammon at the same time - even that they are synonymous in many instances.</p> <p>Curiously, turkey does not seem to have been on the menu of that first-ever Thanksgiving feast. Today, however, it is an established part of the ritual. As at Christmas, it is the smaller ones - weighing 5-6kg - rather than the thunder-thighed behemoths that perform best in the oven. Ideally, they should be free range, as the mass-produced varieties overcook dramatically and become as sawdust.</p> <p>I think that we must include the sweet-potato-and-marshmallow affair because such a barking-mad confection is a culinary marvel in its own right.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes I think that Thanksgiving is an event conjured up by Hollywood in lavish, homely mode - somewhere between Meet Me In St Louis and Little Women. It is staged every year, ostensibly to banish all ill will and allow peace to prevail. It seems a day made up almost entirely of quaint ritual and food - lots and lots of food. And such food, too: roast turkey, a month before Christmas; corn bread; sweet potatoes cooked with marshmallow. Frankly, it all seems most odd. Charming, but odd. But then I am just a Brit, one of a dull crowd who do Christmas and, God help us, New Year under duress. Christmas is crabbed by guilt, commercialism and general excess. It has become shorn of its emotional trappings. But to an American, Thanksgiving Day is a complete surrender of hearth, home and hooch to kith and kin from any and all points of the compass. It is an event that travels in the heart and soul of Americans - wherever they may be, the fourth Thursday in November is dedicated to celebrating the survival of the Pilgrim Fathers through their first year on the continent in 1621. But it hasn't always been the fourth Thursday in November. In fact, the first ever Thanksgiving was in October, when the pilgrims sat down to a feast that they had prepared for their native American benefactors, without whose kindly aid they might well all have perished. Indeed, in Canada, Thanksgiving is still celebrated on the second Monday of October. Most of the implements, seeds and experience that the pilgrims brought with them were redundant in this new world, and the huts that they built were scant protection against a climate that was savagely cold and relentless compared with the mild, damp English winters they were used to. Thanksgiving then disappeared off the official agenda for some 200 years, until 1863 when Abraham Lincoln was persuaded to set aside the last Thursday in November for celebration, at least in part due to a campaign orchestrated by the formidable Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of Godey's Lady's Book. The date was changed to the fourth Thursday in November (you may well ask how many Thursdays can there be in a single month) by President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1939, when he succumbed to the arguments of Federated Department Stores boss, Fred Lazarus Jr, who pointed out that Thanksgiving Day ushered in the Christmas season, and that a longer Yuletide shopathon would be good for the economy. As we can assume that what was good for the economy was also good for Federated's stores, the story of the changing dates of Thanksgiving Day neatly encapsulates the American belief that you can worship God and Mammon at the same time - even that they are synonymous in many instances. Curiously, turkey does not seem to have been on the menu of that first-ever Thanksgiving feast. Today, however, it is an established part of the ritual. As at Christmas, it is the smaller ones - weighing 5-6kg - rather than the thunder-thighed behemoths that perform best in the oven. Ideally, they should be free range, as the mass-produced varieties overcook dramatically and become as sawdust. I think that we must include the sweet-potato-and-marshmallow affair because such a barking-mad confection is a culinary marvel in its own right. The pumpkin, meanwhile, is obligatory - it is indigenous to the continent, even though I doubt that the native Americans or the settlers used them in pies. Despite this, both dishes cannot be ignored because they play an essential role in what is the embodiment of American unity, bonhomie, camaraderie and contentment. The most potent element of Thanksgiving Day, fittingly, is food - and plenty of it. So let the celebrations begin. All recipes serve six. The turkey The bird is central to the feast, so buy a splendid one - organic, free-range and bronze, hung in the feather a few days before plucking, if possible - and eschew the massed ranks of frozen, bagged matter that has more in common with a morgue than with a kitchen - you and your guests will be all the merrier for a sound investment. A bird weighing no more than 5-6kg 250g unsalted butter 1 glass white wine For the stuffing 250g white breadcrumbs 2 large lemons 2 handfuls of picked flat-leaf parsley 1 tsp dried marjoram 1 tsp dried thyme 250g unsalted butter 3 eggs Sea salt Fully charged pepper mill Begin by making the stuffing.

Remove the foil, sit the bird on the roasting tin, and pour over a small glass of white wine before returning it to the oven for a further 30 minutes or so, until it is a deep golden colour. When your bird displays a rich hue, remove it from the oven and, most important, allow it to sit for at least half an hour before carving, in order to allow the juices to settle. Sweet potatop with marshmallow This is Grandmother Tillman's recipe, lifted straight from the pages of the American food bible, Saveur. 60g raisins 40ml sherry 3 medium sweet potatoes 80g soft dark brown sugar 125g unsalted butter 30ml orange juice 1 tsp finely chopped orange zest tsp ground cinnamon tsp ground ginger Pinch ground nutmeg Pinch ground allspice 40g coarsely chopped pecan nuts 50g pineapple (yes, tinned!) 2 handfuls marshmallow Pre-heat the oven to 185\u00b0C/365\u00b0F/gas mark 5.

      "body": "<p>Just recently, the novelist Barbara Kingsolver gave her publishers an ultimatum - exerted control over her environment, you could say: she would continue to do book tours and give readings only on the condition that these took place in halls of no less than 500 people and that the money raised from ticket sales be donated to a local environmental cause. In this way she could feel she was being useful, \"and not simply parading around saying look at me, drawing attention to myself, which is something I hate\". </p> <p>Naturally, the publishers concurred. Kingsolver is a bestselling author who deals with big themes. Her last novel, The Poisonwood Bible, has sold more than two million copies after it was taken up by Oprah Winfrey's book club: \"It reached a whole different readership,\" she says. \"Women who watch TV in the afternoon.\" And her latest book, Prodigal Summer, has already made its way on to bestseller lists in the US. If she wants to promote the idea of self-promotion as some kind of vulgarity unless harnessed to the common good, no one is going to argue. </p> <p>So, the citizens of Chicago, Michigan, Milwaukee, Baltimore, North Carolina, and that was just last week, had their consciousness raised. In Tucson, where she lives, hundreds of dollars were donated in one evening to help save the Sonoma desert. And the publishers got to sell their books. Put like this, it sounds like a clever mixture of piety and calculation. But it is, as Kingsolver, a former biologist, would recognise, the perfect biological fix. It furthers the species, in this case the novelist - through the individual: it is at the level of individuals that we create, after all - while recognising, in the overall scheme of things, the individual's relative insignificance. \"I am not here just to blow my own horn,\" as Kingsolver says. </p> <p>She has never bought \"the ridiculous myth\" of individualism, Kingsolver says. \"At school, all the heroes we were taught to admire were the solo fliers, like Lindbergh or Edison. It's the national religion of America - the self-made man who depends on no one.\" It is also the great human arrogance, she says, \"to think we are the most important thing; and not only that, to act as if we are the only thing\", when it's obvious that we are part of the animal chain - and more subject to other laws than we like to think we are. </p> <p>But what has made us the most successful animal on the planet is precisely individualism. It may be an illusion, but it's a pretty effective driving force. She knows this, of course. When Kingsolver says that now she is successful she can call the shots, she may be acting on behalf of the group, but it's not a group assertion. It's her. The part of her that's the scientist can stand outside and see humans as just another species; the part that is the novelist writes from the inside, where human beings can't be seen as just another life swarm and where emotions and motivations matter. </p> <p>It's an unusual position for a novelist to take - both inside and outside culture. And it's a tension she plays in all her books: a reverence for nature that never gives way to a disdain for humans. What she is saying is that as human beings we need both the humility to accept our position as part of the bigger scheme and the self- determination that makes us act. Both are survival tactics. It is this impulse that makes her write: \"The belief that by re-imagining the world you can change it.\" </p> <p>She assumed that she would be a scientist. That's not quite right. Early on, she wanted to be a professional musician. But in spite of a music scholarship to university, she gave this up on the basis that she wasn't good enough to provide herself with a decent living and took to biology instead. Coming from where she did, a small rural town in Kentucky where people struggled to make a living out of what nature provided for them - in this case, growing tobacco - she understood the basic pragmatism. \"You do what you have to do. When it's time to get the tobacco in, you get the tobacco in.\" </p> <p>In such a community, she says, the idea that one would be a writer - do anything superfluous to need - was risible. Her father was the local doctor, taking care of, making provision for, bodily need. Her mother \"was his wife\". Interdependence, mutual support systems, was the governing ethic. Elsewhere, outside this framework, it was a story of cock-up, misery, misunderstanding. Teenage pregnancies, wife beating. \"Limited possibilities, limited hope.\" Saturday nights, all the kids would be in the back seat of a car at the drive-in. Except her. She wasn't adapted to this world, she says. Flat-chested, she didn't have the necessary physiological attractions. Boys didn't like her. To survive, or rather to thrive, she had to move on. </p> <p>At DePauw University, in Indiana, she found a community of like-minded people. People who read books, who talked about ideas, who acted on their passions - protesting about Vietnam, involving themselves in the civil rights movement. Here, she found a different kind of usefulness, \"a sense of obligation about fixing things that were wrong. The wider world I'd been looking for.\" And having left her home town in Kentucky, she never went back. What's interesting, she says, is that when she left, aged 18, almost 30 years ago, it was a community of 1,600 people, and today it remains 1,600 people. \"What that means is that when I moved out, someone else moved in. It's a very static community.\" That is the nature of subsistence. </p> <p>She both loved and hated Kentucky, her childhood. In many ways it made her who she is. A community, in which individualism was discouraged, forged her individualism. \"I grew up aware of all the people I depended on and who depended on me.\" She loved the rural landscape - what she remembers happily of that time is climbing trees - but she also resented it. The great thing about small-town life, she has often said, is that everybody knows your business. \"And the bad thing about small-town life is that everybody knows your business... I suppose that is my central obsession. What we owe to society, what we owe to ourselves.\" </p> <p>At the point at which she left, she must have decided that what she owed to herself took precedence. After university she headed for Europe. Living in Greece, working on archaeological digs, she taught herself Greek. Superfluity rather than subsistence. In France, she lived in a commune. For the first time, she says, she was able to see America not as it sees itself but as how it is seen, \"from the outside\". Europe gave her a new perspective: \"You are far less wasteful, more resourceful. Here, we are still pioneers. We arrive, we use up, we move on in a national spirit of 'when this is done, there will be more', we'll just keep moving west. Well, this is west. You have to stop somewhere.\" Hard to love something when you see it from the outside. </p> <p>After a couple of years, when her working visa ran out, she returned, of necessity, to America and headed for Tucson. Why Tucson is a good question. She knew nobody there. Had never been there. It was 2,000 miles from home. \"About as far as you in England are from the former Yugoslavia. We can look that up on a map if you want to check.\" Tucson, as anyone who has been there knows, is a strangely ambivalent place: an urban sprawl of a million inhabitants, dropped into the dramatic beauty of a desert. Here, two kinds of brutal isolation collide, natural and cultural. The uniform quality of the desert landscape - its symbolism as the barrier to the Promised Land - seems to mirror the barren loneliness of a city that has no centre. No one walks in Tucson. On the streets you rarely see a soul. Its grid structure is as repetitive and unrelieved as the desert itself. Yet, like the desert, it is quietly alive - hardy, resourceful, full of life. Also fragile and fascinating, vulnerable to abuse. Lots of echoes in the desert ecosystem. </p> <p>Still, she was a biologist. Still not writing. As a junior lab technician at the University of Arizona she eked out some kind of materially impoverished existence - \"I was very poor\" - and observed the difference between urban poverty and rural poverty. \"At home, growing up, we weren't really poor. We had everything we needed, we just didn't have what we wanted. Now, in the city, I understood for the first time what it is to go without what you need.\" </p> <p>For a community, she looked on the university noticeboards and joined various activist groups. Her natural instinct, a kind of shy assertiveness, would make her want to become part of something outside. \"That was my context. It was the first time in my life that I was putting down roots, trying to establish myself. Decide who I was.\" And, invisible though it was to any newcomer, the support system in Tucson was fully in place. At that time, as she says, the early 80s, \"The central issue here was, and it remains, Latin America.\" </p> <p> Tucson is only 60 miles from the Mexican border. \"It was a time when the US was waging covert war in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador. Refugees were fleeing American bombs and being stopped at the border. It seemed so hypocritical that America was opening its arms to refugees from China, from Cuba, and yet these people trying to escape our bombs were turned back.\" She joined with many others in offering refuge. \"The sanctuary movement began here.\" Helping people establish new identities, finding them homes. All her first friends in Tucson were from this refugee community. In self-imposed exile from one world, she found herself part of something else. And she learned what has become central to her moral vision: \"That a lot of the time human laws are wrong, simply put in place to serve economics.\" </p> <p>After a few years in Tucson, she did what we are here to do as a species - got married, reproduced. The marriage wasn't a success. But Camille, the first of her two daughters, seemed to her, \"the most beautiful, unique human being on the planet\". Until she had her second daughter, Lily (10 years later and with her second husband), who mysteriously managed to occupy the same space. There is no objectivity in parenthood. As a mother, she says, she tries to provide her children with what they need, not what they think they want. She doesn't teach them to believe in God. But she accepts, she says, the value of religion. </p> <p>\"I used to think religion was just more of the same thing. Dump responsibility on the big guy. Now I see an importance in that. It's a relief to accept that not everything is under your control.\" When her children ask her what happens when we die, she tells them that we become compost, \"that our molecules are reconfigured as a tree. That is our heaven and it seems to work pretty well for us.\" </p> <p>She ascribes \"politeness\" - the most contrived, \"civilised\" of human motivations - as the reason for writing her first book. \"I can't help being polite. It is how I was raised, to be a lady.\" By 1983, she had left the university and begun working as a freelance journalist, mostly for scientific journals, interpreting the arcane language of science for the masses. \"I discovered it was an open market for anyone who could understand the language of science but write about it in another language.\" </p> <p>One weekend, to supplement her income, \"earn my daily bread\", she set out across southern Arizona to cover a series of mine strikes at the Phelps Dodge copper mines. Over a period of 18 months, while the strike lasted, and was ultimately defeated, she conducted interviews with the women who were left behind in these towns while the men were off elsewhere seeking an income. Kingsolver spent so much time there she became \"that gal writing the book\". \"So that is what I had to do. They were counting on me.\" </p> <p>Holding The Line is the story of these women, women normally so submissive that they would not leave home without their husband's permission, but who were now holding the line against Arizona's National Guard, handling the day-to-day running of the strike. </p> <p>The book became a study in transformation - from passivity to powerfulness. \"The women's transformation affected every aspect of their lives, their relationships with their husbands, their children, with me.\" It was a frankly biased, non-fictional account; when she submitted it to the first publisher, she was told, 'Sorry but we don't accept novels'. It wasn't, as she says, a version of the truth that they could accept. Her writing is often described by critics as \"female\", by which she thinks they mean \"a feminine sensibility\". \"It's not as though I have no men in my books. But I examine support systems, not the lone hero. I am interested in how everything works together.\" Solitude, she says, is a human presumption. \"Or, dare I say it, a male presumption.\" </p> <p>She wrote her first novel, The Bean Trees, at night in a closet. She was pregnant, living with her husband in a tiny house, and he couldn't sleep if she had the light on. The day that she went into labour she heard it had been accepted for publication. \"So the significance of it kind of passed me by.\" But the money she earned gave her enough to support herself to write her next book. And so on, until Pigs In Heaven and then The Poisonwood Bible provided financial stability. </p> <p>She begins a book, she says, with themes. \"I know some writers begin with character and plot; I invent characters to serve my theme.\" Her theme is essentially her culture, its history, and making sense of its place in the world. She remains, she says, both committed to America and despairing of America. \"I take responsibility for where I am in the world and part of that is being a citizen of the US, which has done many shameful things and many great things. As a writer, it is my job to encourage people to own up to the less pleasant realities of our legacy.\" </p> <p>So in The Poisonwood Bible, a profoundly ambitious book set in the Belgian Congo as it comes to independence, she asks the question: how do I live in a country that did these things to Africa? A country that assassinated the elected leader Patrice Lumumba and replaced him with Mobutu, a puppet dictator? She is not preaching. Misplaced, or misdirected, zeal is also the book's subject - on the large scale in the political world, and on the small scale in the personal world of Nathan Price, a thundering Baptist missionary, unaffected by doubt, who drags his family to Africa to convert the natives. Price believes that everyone can be converted, but he is wrong, and the pursuit of salvation becomes his damnation. Kingsolver believes that writing can encourage new habits of moral perception. She tells the story from the multiple perspective of Price's four daughters - a democratic process. The only voice missing is Price's own. He is judged, as Kingsolver implies America must be judged, through the effects of his actions. </p> <p>The massive success of The Poisonwood Bible in 1998 changed very little in her life, she says. She has never been interested in money, and now gives most of it away, \"far more than I keep\". And her personal world had already undergone a dramatic transformation when eight years ago she met Steven Hopp, an ornithologist and sometime jazz musician. After five years on her own, sick of men, tired of dating, she met him while she was on a two-week fellowship at Virginia University. \"I have always believed that the best things happen when you are looking the other way.\" They spent one evening together talking. And then a year speaking to each other nightly on the telephone. \"When we finally did get together, we used to have to sit with our hands covering our eyes, we were so unused to each others' physical presence.\" There is something so sensual, erotic in this image. Two people sitting together, connected but not touching. It is this eroticism and delight in sensuality that filters through her new book, Prodigal Summer. </p> <p>It is a strange book. She knew as she was writing it, she says, that it might have a rough ride with some critics. \"I knew it was much sexier than anything I had written before and that they might have a hard time with that.\" Even so, she is surprised by the hostility of some responses. \"It's as though I have done something subversive. That's to say: this culture has created a convincing illusion that it is in control, but it's still an illusion; that there are parallels between the natural world and the human world - to suggest that the human world is the natural world is too deeply threatening to the self-importance of the urbane.\" It was a shock, she says, to realise that a lot of people found it easier to accept the world and the intricate politics of the Congo than this fairly straightforward biological parable set in the Appalachian mountains. </p> <p> Again the novel is told through the interweaving of linked narratives. There is no dominant character. But the framework of the story is provided by Deanna, a 45-year-old naturalist, living a solitary life in the mountains among the animals she is paid to preserve. At the beginning of the book she is happy, \"or thinks she is happy\". It's a happiness that Kingsolver says could have gone on maybe two more years. \"Not more.\" Deanna's practised self-deception - that she can continue in this isolation - falls apart with the sudden arrival of a man, Eddie Bono, who wakes her up to her animal, fundamentally biological, desires. </p> <p>Kingsolver says she never writes about herself, or indeed about anyone she has known. \"I feel like I have to put a banner on the front of my books saying, 'This is not me. These are not my parents.' People always want to believe that writers are writing about themselves. I am not.\" It's a bit disingenuous this, and a bit overemphatic. If what she is saying is that we, as humans, as individuals, have to recognise we are not supremely important, then it is at the level of the individual that we grasp this point. And there's a certain self-importance in saying that the importance of the message is to grasp that we are not important. Individualism may even be Nature's cleverest trick. To put it another way: animals don't write books. </p> <p> \u0095 Prodigal Summer, by Barbara Kingsolver, is published by Faber on December 1, priced \u00a317.99.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just recently, the novelist Barbara Kingsolver gave her publishers an ultimatum - exerted control over her environment, you could say: she would continue to do book tours and give readings only on the condition that these took place in halls of no less than 500 people and that the money raised from ticket sales be donated to a local environmental cause. In this way she could feel she was being useful, \"and not simply parading around saying look at me, drawing attention to myself, which is something I hate\". Naturally, the publishers concurred. Kingsolver is a bestselling author who deals with big themes. Her last novel, The Poisonwood Bible, has sold more than two million copies after it was taken up by Oprah Winfrey's book club: \"It reached a whole different readership,\" she says. \"Women who watch TV in the afternoon.\" And her latest book, Prodigal Summer, has already made its way on to bestseller lists in the US. If she wants to promote the idea of self-promotion as some kind of vulgarity unless harnessed to the common good, no one is going to argue. So, the citizens of Chicago, Michigan, Milwaukee, Baltimore, North Carolina, and that was just last week, had their consciousness raised. In Tucson, where she lives, hundreds of dollars were donated in one evening to help save the Sonoma desert. And the publishers got to sell their books. Put like this, it sounds like a clever mixture of piety and calculation. But it is, as Kingsolver, a former biologist, would recognise, the perfect biological fix. It furthers the species, in this case the novelist - through the individual: it is at the level of individuals that we create, after all - while recognising, in the overall scheme of things, the individual's relative insignificance. \"I am not here just to blow my own horn,\" as Kingsolver says. She has never bought \"the ridiculous myth\" of individualism, Kingsolver says. \"At school, all the heroes we were taught to admire were the solo fliers, like Lindbergh or Edison. It's the national religion of America - the self-made man who depends on no one.\" It is also the great human arrogance, she says, \"to think we are the most important thing; and not only that, to act as if we are the only thing\", when it's obvious that we are part of the animal chain - and more subject to other laws than we like to think we are. But what has made us the most successful animal on the planet is precisely individualism. It may be an illusion, but it's a pretty effective driving force. She knows this, of course. When Kingsolver says that now she is successful she can call the shots, she may be acting on behalf of the group, but it's not a group assertion. It's her. The part of her that's the scientist can stand outside and see humans as just another species; the part that is the novelist writes from the inside, where human beings can't be seen as just another life swarm and where emotions and motivations matter. It's an unusual position for a novelist to take - both inside and outside culture. And it's a tension she plays in all her books: a reverence for nature that never gives way to a disdain for humans. What she is saying is that as human beings we need both the humility to accept our position as part of the bigger scheme and the self- determination that makes us act. Both are survival tactics. It is this impulse that makes her write: \"The belief that by re-imagining the world you can change it.\" She assumed that she would be a scientist. That's not quite right. Early on, she wanted to be a professional musician. But in spite of a music scholarship to university, she gave this up on the basis that she wasn't good enough to provide herself with a decent living and took to biology instead. Coming from where she did, a small rural town in Kentucky where people struggled to make a living out of what nature provided for them - in this case, growing tobacco - she understood the basic pragmatism. \"You do what you have to do. When it's time to get the tobacco in, you get the tobacco in.\" In such a community, she says, the idea that one would be a writer - do anything superfluous to need - was risible. Her father was the local doctor, taking care of, making provision for, bodily need. Her mother \"was his wife\". Interdependence, mutual support systems, was the governing ethic. Elsewhere, outside this framework, it was a story of cock-up, misery, misunderstanding. Teenage pregnancies, wife beating. \"Limited possibilities, limited hope.\" Saturday nights, all the kids would be in the back seat of a car at the drive-in. Except her. She wasn't adapted to this world, she says. Flat-chested, she didn't have the necessary physiological attractions. Boys didn't like her. To survive, or rather to thrive, she had to move on. At DePauw University, in Indiana, she found a community of like-minded people. People who read books, who talked about ideas, who acted on their passions - protesting about Vietnam, involving themselves in the civil rights movement. Here, she found a different kind of usefulness, \"a sense of obligation about fixing things that were wrong. The wider world I'd been looking for.\" And having left her home town in Kentucky, she never went back. What's interesting, she says, is that when she left, aged 18, almost 30 years ago, it was a community of 1,600 people, and today it remains 1,600 people. \"What that means is that when I moved out, someone else moved in. It's a very static community.\" That is the nature of subsistence. She both loved and hated Kentucky, her childhood. In many ways it made her who she is. A community, in which individualism was discouraged, forged her individualism. \"I grew up aware of all the people I depended on and who depended on me.\" She loved the rural landscape - what she remembers happily of that time is climbing trees - but she also resented it. The great thing about small-town life, she has often said, is that everybody knows your business. \"And the bad thing about small-town life is that everybody knows your business... I suppose that is my central obsession. What we owe to society, what we owe to ourselves.\" At the point at which she left, she must have decided that what she owed to herself took precedence. After university she headed for Europe. Living in Greece, working on archaeological digs, she taught herself Greek. Superfluity rather than subsistence. In France, she lived in a commune. For the first time, she says, she was able to see America not as it sees itself but as how it is seen, \"from the outside\". Europe gave her a new perspective: \"You are far less wasteful, more resourceful. Here, we are still pioneers. We arrive, we use up, we move on in a national spirit of 'when this is done, there will be more', we'll just keep moving west. Well, this is west. You have to stop somewhere.\" Hard to love something when you see it from the outside. After a couple of years, when her working visa ran out, she returned, of necessity, to America and headed for Tucson. Why Tucson is a good question. She knew nobody there. Had never been there. It was 2,000 miles from home. \"About as far as you in England are from the former Yugoslavia. We can look that up on a map if you want to check.\" Tucson, as anyone who has been there knows, is a strangely ambivalent place: an urban sprawl of a million inhabitants, dropped into the dramatic beauty of a desert. Here, two kinds of brutal isolation collide, natural and cultural. The uniform quality of the desert landscape - its symbolism as the barrier to the Promised Land - seems to mirror the barren loneliness of a city that has no centre. No one walks in Tucson. On the streets you rarely see a soul. Its grid structure is as repetitive and unrelieved as the desert itself. Yet, like the desert, it is quietly alive - hardy, resourceful, full of life. Also fragile and fascinating, vulnerable to abuse. Lots of echoes in the desert ecosystem. Still, she was a biologist. Still not writing. As a junior lab technician at the University of Arizona she eked out some kind of materially impoverished existence - \"I was very poor\" - and observed the difference between urban poverty and rural poverty. \"At home, growing up, we weren't really poor. We had everything we needed, we just didn't have what we wanted. Now, in the city, I understood for the first time what it is to go without what you need.\" For a community, she looked on the university noticeboards and joined various activist groups. Her natural instinct, a kind of shy assertiveness, would make her want to become part of something outside. \"That was my context. It was the first time in my life that I was putting down roots, trying to establish myself. Decide who I was.\" And, invisible though it was to any newcomer, the support system in Tucson was fully in place. At that time, as she says, the early 80s, \"The central issue here was, and it remains, Latin America.\" Tucson is only 60 miles from the Mexican border. \"It was a time when the US was waging covert war in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador. Refugees were fleeing American bombs and being stopped at the border. It seemed so hypocritical that America was opening its arms to refugees from China, from Cuba, and yet these people trying to escape our bombs were turned back.\" She joined with many others in offering refuge. \"The sanctuary movement began here.\" Helping people establish new identities, finding them homes. All her first friends in Tucson were from this refugee community. In self-imposed exile from one world, she found herself part of something else. And she learned what has become central to her moral vision: \"That a lot of the time human laws are wrong, simply put in place to serve economics.\" After a few years in Tucson, she did what we are here to do as a species - got married, reproduced. The marriage wasn't a success. But Camille, the first of her two daughters, seemed to her, \"the most beautiful, unique human being on the planet\". Until she had her second daughter, Lily (10 years later and with her second husband), who mysteriously managed to occupy the same space. There is no objectivity in parenthood. As a mother, she says, she tries to provide her children with what they need, not what they think they want. She doesn't teach them to believe in God. But she accepts, she says, the value of religion. \"I used to think religion was just more of the same thing. Dump responsibility on the big guy. Now I see an importance in that. It's a relief to accept that not everything is under your control.\" When her children ask her what happens when we die, she tells them that we become compost, \"that our molecules are reconfigured as a tree. That is our heaven and it seems to work pretty well for us.\" She ascribes \"politeness\" - the most contrived, \"civilised\" of human motivations - as the reason for writing her first book. \"I can't help being polite. It is how I was raised, to be a lady.\" By 1983, she had left the university and begun working as a freelance journalist, mostly for scientific journals, interpreting the arcane language of science for the masses. \"I discovered it was an open market for anyone who could understand the language of science but write about it in another language.\" One weekend, to supplement her income, \"earn my daily bread\", she set out across southern Arizona to cover a series of mine strikes at the Phelps Dodge copper mines. Over a period of 18 months, while the strike lasted, and was ultimately defeated, she conducted interviews with the women who were left behind in these towns while the men were off elsewhere seeking an income. Kingsolver spent so much time there she became \"that gal writing the book\". \"So that is what I had to do. They were counting on me.\" Holding The Line is the story of these women, women normally so submissive that they would not leave home without their husband's permission, but who were now holding the line against Arizona's National Guard, handling the day-to-day running of the strike. The book became a study in transformation - from passivity to powerfulness. \"The women's transformation affected every aspect of their lives, their relationships with their husbands, their children, with me.\" It was a frankly biased, non-fictional account; when she submitted it to the first publisher, she was told, 'Sorry but we don't accept novels'. It wasn't, as she says, a version of the truth that they could accept. Her writing is often described by critics as \"female\", by which she thinks they mean \"a feminine sensibility\". \"It's not as though I have no men in my books. But I examine support systems, not the lone hero. I am interested in how everything works together.\" Solitude, she says, is a human presumption. \"Or, dare I say it, a male presumption.\" She wrote her first novel, The Bean Trees, at night in a closet. She was pregnant, living with her husband in a tiny house, and he couldn't sleep if she had the light on. The day that she went into labour she heard it had been accepted for publication. \"So the significance of it kind of passed me by.\" But the money she earned gave her enough to support herself to write her next book. And so on, until Pigs In Heaven and then The Poisonwood Bible provided financial stability. She begins a book, she says, with themes. \"I know some writers begin with character and plot; I invent characters to serve my theme.\" Her theme is essentially her culture, its history, and making sense of its place in the world. She remains, she says, both committed to America and despairing of America. \"I take responsibility for where I am in the world and part of that is being a citizen of the US, which has done many shameful things and many great things.

      "body": "<p>I was out on Beachy Head last weekend, and I must say I was quite surprised to find it so empty. My boyfriend and I passed only two other sets of hikers as we made our way to the notorious suicide's leap, whereas I thought it would be more crowded than the nearby Eastbourne Arndale Centre with the bodies of young Spice Girls fans left with nothing to live for now that Westlife had beaten their girls to the top album spot. </p> <p>To judge from the past week's newspapers, this was what was agitating more souls than Bush vs Gore, Railtrack vs The People and the fuel protesters vs Blair put together. But no - peering down the cliff, there was no sign of the expected lifeless heap of Morgan and Claire's Accessories finery. Because, the thing is, young people don't really care what's at the top of the charts these days. They'll be on the internet, or on their PlayStations, or out skateboarding, or hanging around the mall. Rather shamefully, it's us, people my age, people in their 30s and 40s, who have this sad, morbid obsession with popular music. It's not hard to understand why, I'll grant you - when we were young, we didn't have much else: we had three TV channels, Radio 1, and that was it. </p> <p>The huge appeal of popular music to the bereft generations who grew up in the 60s, 70s and 80s - robbed of the communal street-culture of the 40s and 50s by the worries evoked in our parents by the likes of the Moors Murderers, yet unable to access the solitary smorgasbord of entertainment options available to children today - is obvious. Add to this the usual impact of pop on kids - that one day you're just sitting there happily playing with your Etch A Sketch and planning to marry your father, when, whompff, them hormones kick in and suddenly all you're sure of is that nobody, nobody, ever felt this way before, and it hurts - and obviously you're going to breed a bunch of people with more interest in who was No 1 on June 23, 1972, than may be good for them in the long run. </p> <p>There's no shame in this obsession - to a certain extent. At the age of 12, I actually promised my soul to the Devil when I was 50 if only Marc Bolan would chat me up when I was 17. Chalk pentagram and everything. And do you know what? He did, only by then, of course, I didn't fancy him any more. And, anyway, I had my fingers crossed. But why do we keep on caring? I would say it's because we have all this excess desire for passion and progress, and nowhere to put it - looking for love in all the wrong places, if you will. </p> <p>In the past, adults reaching their 30s would gladly put away childish things and devote their free time to religion, politics and their families. Now, many people in their 30s find those elements as remote from their grasp as they were when they were 13. </p> <p>Now, it's all well and good to take an interest in the young people's ruckus if we do so politely and with some perspective, but the minute we whip ourselves into a full-scale frenzy about the silliness of pop today, we are going down exactly the same route we so despised our parents for when they sniggered at Bryan Ferry's trousers and asked repeatedly whether the Davids Bowie, Cassidy and Essex were \"boys or girls\". Ha bloody ha! (To any member of my usual geek chorus who's already putting ego to email rhetorically to enquire why I became so interested in the lyrics of Eminem the other week, I'd say, it's obvious, stupid. I'm talking about dumb, regular pop music. The minute a crooning moron pokes their lightweight nose into heavyweight, real-world issues such as the desirability of killing women or blacks, they're cruising for a real-world bruising. So butt out.) </p> <p>When someone starts talking about what garbage music today is, they immediately identify themselves as someone who should be moving on and not caring. Tellingly, both Madonna and the Spice Girls have done this in recent weeks - so isn't it nice for you carpers to know you've got such a bunch of musical luminaries on your side.</p> <p> People don't move on because they're scared to. In the case of Madonna, her heart is obviously set on acting, but the audience doesn't want to know, so she keeps serving up warmed-over slop such as Music, while secretly despising the people who buy it. Madonna even called for the return of punk, showing off her own conventionality and business-mindedness rather amusingly, I thought, as if you could order up a bit of \"danger\" when things got a tad too bland, like getting the waiter over with the big pepper pot. </p> <p>Besides, what these meatheads fail to understand is that the Sex Pistols, say, were about as dangerous as Pop Sox, and actually had far more in common with the Spice Girls - in terms of invention, impact and ambition - than a \"serious\", \"political\" band such as Radiohead, who are, of course, equally \"safe\". The stark fact is that no sort of revolutionary ever goes into the entertainment business, because entertainment is there to divert us from the reality of our lives. It doesn't matter what the lyrics say: the pacifying effect is the same. </p> <p> Indeed, far from making one a deep, noble person, there's a case for saying that people who want pop music to \"mean\" something are probably less, not more, political than others. If you want something to mean something, why not get it through meaningful mediums such as politics and religion? Are you really such a dweeb that you need be spoonfed important issues accompanied by tunes and a lightshow? </p> <p>People always speak of the 60s as the high point of political music, but when you see photographs of American youth of the time, it's interesting to see that those on the civil rights and anti-Vietnam protests looked gloriously square, with a good number of prom queens and letter-sweater hunks among them, not natural rock fans. While music-loving hippies were deemed such a non-threat to national security that the US air force dropped tons of sandwiches on Woodstock when the boobies proved incapable of sorting out their own feeding routine, that same air force dropped napalm on Vietnamese children. And, wouldn't you know it, those hippies scarfed them down happily. Let's hear it for rebel music! </p> <p>It makes about as much solid sense for an adult to complain about the state of the singles chart as it does for a grown woman to buy her jewellery at Girl's World and then go back two weeks later to complain that the tiara and sparkly wand didn't last. It's sad and inappropriate, and it isn't meant for you! POP! - it's the sound of the stuff the kiddies drink, and of something wonderful and flimsy exploding after a quick, shimmering moment in the sun, never to return. Ecologists say that we don't own the planet; we're just keeping it for our children. I think the same is true of popular music. It's theirs now - let it go.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I was out on Beachy Head last weekend, and I must say I was quite surprised to find it so empty. My boyfriend and I passed only two other sets of hikers as we made our way to the notorious suicide's leap, whereas I thought it would be more crowded than the nearby Eastbourne Arndale Centre with the bodies of young Spice Girls fans left with nothing to live for now that Westlife had beaten their girls to the top album spot. To judge from the past week's newspapers, this was what was agitating more souls than Bush vs Gore, Railtrack vs The People and the fuel protesters vs Blair put together. But no - peering down the cliff, there was no sign of the expected lifeless heap of Morgan and Claire's Accessories finery. Because, the thing is, young people don't really care what's at the top of the charts these days. They'll be on the internet, or on their PlayStations, or out skateboarding, or hanging around the mall. Rather shamefully, it's us, people my age, people in their 30s and 40s, who have this sad, morbid obsession with popular music. It's not hard to understand why, I'll grant you - when we were young, we didn't have much else: we had three TV channels, Radio 1, and that was it. The huge appeal of popular music to the bereft generations who grew up in the 60s, 70s and 80s - robbed of the communal street-culture of the 40s and 50s by the worries evoked in our parents by the likes of the Moors Murderers, yet unable to access the solitary smorgasbord of entertainment options available to children today - is obvious. Add to this the usual impact of pop on kids - that one day you're just sitting there happily playing with your Etch A Sketch and planning to marry your father, when, whompff, them hormones kick in and suddenly all you're sure of is that nobody, nobody, ever felt this way before, and it hurts - and obviously you're going to breed a bunch of people with more interest in who was No 1 on June 23, 1972, than may be good for them in the long run. There's no shame in this obsession - to a certain extent. At the age of 12, I actually promised my soul to the Devil when I was 50 if only Marc Bolan would chat me up when I was 17. Chalk pentagram and everything. And do you know what? He did, only by then, of course, I didn't fancy him any more. And, anyway, I had my fingers crossed. But why do we keep on caring? I would say it's because we have all this excess desire for passion and progress, and nowhere to put it - looking for love in all the wrong places, if you will. In the past, adults reaching their 30s would gladly put away childish things and devote their free time to religion, politics and their families. Now, many people in their 30s find those elements as remote from their grasp as they were when they were 13. Now, it's all well and good to take an interest in the young people's ruckus if we do so politely and with some perspective, but the minute we whip ourselves into a full-scale frenzy about the silliness of pop today, we are going down exactly the same route we so despised our parents for when they sniggered at Bryan Ferry's trousers and asked repeatedly whether the Davids Bowie, Cassidy and Essex were \"boys or girls\". Ha bloody ha! (To any member of my usual geek chorus who's already putting ego to email rhetorically to enquire why I became so interested in the lyrics of Eminem the other week, I'd say, it's obvious, stupid. I'm talking about dumb, regular pop music. The minute a crooning moron pokes their lightweight nose into heavyweight, real-world issues such as the desirability of killing women or blacks, they're cruising for a real-world bruising. So butt out.) When someone starts talking about what garbage music today is, they immediately identify themselves as someone who should be moving on and not caring. Tellingly, both Madonna and the Spice Girls have done this in recent weeks - so isn't it nice for you carpers to know you've got such a bunch of musical luminaries on your side. People don't move on because they're scared to. In the case of Madonna, her heart is obviously set on acting, but the audience doesn't want to know, so she keeps serving up warmed-over slop such as Music, while secretly despising the people who buy it. Madonna even called for the return of punk, showing off her own conventionality and business-mindedness rather amusingly, I thought, as if you could order up a bit of \"danger\" when things got a tad too bland, like getting the waiter over with the big pepper pot. Besides, what these meatheads fail to understand is that the Sex Pistols, say, were about as dangerous as Pop Sox, and actually had far more in common with the Spice Girls - in terms of invention, impact and ambition - than a \"serious\", \"political\" band such as Radiohead, who are, of course, equally \"safe\". The stark fact is that no sort of revolutionary ever goes into the entertainment business, because entertainment is there to divert us from the reality of our lives. It doesn't matter what the lyrics say: the pacifying effect is the same. Indeed, far from making one a deep, noble person, there's a case for saying that people who want pop music to \"mean\" something are probably less, not more, political than others. If you want something to mean something, why not get it through meaningful mediums such as politics and religion? Are you really such a dweeb that you need be spoonfed important issues accompanied by tunes and a lightshow? People always speak of the 60s as the high point of political music, but when you see photographs of American youth of the time, it's interesting to see that those on the civil rights and anti-Vietnam protests looked gloriously square, with a good number of prom queens and letter-sweater hunks among them, not natural rock fans. While music-loving hippies were deemed such a non-threat to national security that the US air force dropped tons of sandwiches on Woodstock when the boobies proved incapable of sorting out their own feeding routine, that same air force dropped napalm on Vietnamese children. And, wouldn't you know it, those hippies scarfed them down happily. Let's hear it for rebel music! It makes about as much solid sense for an adult to complain about the state of the singles chart as it does for a grown woman to buy her jewellery at Girl's World and then go back two weeks later to complain that the tiara and sparkly wand didn't last. It's sad and inappropriate, and it isn't meant for you! POP! - it's the sound of the stuff the kiddies drink, and of something wonderful and flimsy exploding after a quick, shimmering moment in the sun, never to return. Ecologists say that we don't own the planet; we're just keeping it for our children. I think the same is true of popular music. It's theirs now - let it go.",

Yesterday the head of Deutsche B\u00f6rse ruled out a pan-European exchange allying itself, the LSE and Euronext, the merged Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels exchanges. Rolf Breuer, chairman of the Frankfurt exchange, said technology would make such a pact difficult. However, Euronext joined in the public approaches to the LSE, following those made this week by Nasdaq, the US hi-tech market. The LSE appears resolute in rejecting any approach while it seeks out a new chief executive. Although Jiway handled just 250 trades yesterday, chairman Lyton Jones insisted the launch had attracted \"significant interest\".

      "body": "<p>For nine years in the 1950s Britt Woodman, who has died aged 80, was the principal solo trombonist in Duke Ellington's orchestra. Ellington loved to exploit Woodman's technical facility, culminating in the extraordinary Sonnet to Hank Cinq from his Shakespearean suite, in which Woodman moves rapidly from the lower reaches of the trombone's register to its peak in a lip-shattering solo.</p> <p>Woodman succeeded Lawrence Brown with Ellington; ironically, his father, William Woodman Sr, had declined the lead trombone chair taken by Brown back in the 1930s.</p> <p>The Woodmans grew up in Watts, which was then a harmoniously interracial village outside Los Angeles. Their father father assigned each son an instrument to learn, and then another. By their mid-teens, the Woodman brothers were playing weekend engagements billed as the \"biggest little band in the world\". It featured Britt, its youngest member, on clarinet, tenor saxophone and trombone.</p> <p>While at Jordan High School, Britt befriended Charles Mingus: \"very shy, and bow-legged\", and invariably the butt of jokes. Woodman taught Mingus ping-pong and continued to provide him with friendship throughout his turbulent years. He was a regular contributor to Mingus's record sessions, his connection further underlined with his presence in the Mingus Big Band during its visits to Ronnie Scott's in the 1990s.</p> <p>As a 17-year-old, Woodman moonlighted from school to play theatre gigs and work on the Central Avenue entertainment scene. After two years with Les Hite, then leading Los Angeles's finest big band, Woodman was conscripted into the United States Army and saw out the war as a musician stationed in North Carolina.</p> <p>Back in town in 1946, he hooked up with Mingus and saxophonists Buddy Collette and Lucky Thompson to form the Stars of Swing. Using advanced arrangements by Mingus and Collette, this group seemed destined for the limelight, but was short-lived and went unrecorded. When its work ran out, Woodman was snapped up by the popular bandleader Eddie Heywood and then joined Lionel Hampton. Discouraged by Hampton's requirement that his musicians wear gloves, \"act and grin and smile\", Woodman enrolled at music school for two years. Then came the call from Ellington.</p> <p>After the Duke, Woodman freelanced in New York, on studio sessions and one-off gigs, some with Mingus, and also helped to stabilise his friend during a traumatic incident at a 1962 Town Hall concert. After spending a decade in Los Angeles from 1970, Woodman and his wife realised that New York offered livelier opportunities. He played in many long-running Broadway shows, including Jelly's Last Jam, Black and Blue and Sophisticated Ladies.</p> <p>In his latter years, Woodman played in repertory orchestras sent out under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution and Lincoln Centre and appeared on the European festival circuit, often with Clark Terry. He also visited Japan with Benny Carter.</p> <p>Deeply religious, Woodman never pushed himself forward - indeed, he was dismissive of his skills - yet always remained busy. His presence in the Mingus Band seemed especially fitting, as he celebrated his old companion's music and soloed with the same brilliance he had always exhibited. Last year he said, \"While I can still hold the horn, I'll play.\" Sadly, he developed a severe respiratory problem while touring last October and never performed again.</p> <p>Woodman is survived by his elder brothers and their families. His wife, Clara, died in 1991. There were no children.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For nine years in the 1950s Britt Woodman, who has died aged 80, was the principal solo trombonist in Duke Ellington's orchestra. Ellington loved to exploit Woodman's technical facility, culminating in the extraordinary Sonnet to Hank Cinq from his Shakespearean suite, in which Woodman moves rapidly from the lower reaches of the trombone's register to its peak in a lip-shattering solo. Woodman succeeded Lawrence Brown with Ellington; ironically, his father, William Woodman Sr, had declined the lead trombone chair taken by Brown back in the 1930s. The Woodmans grew up in Watts, which was then a harmoniously interracial village outside Los Angeles. Their father father assigned each son an instrument to learn, and then another. By their mid-teens, the Woodman brothers were playing weekend engagements billed as the \"biggest little band in the world\". It featured Britt, its youngest member, on clarinet, tenor saxophone and trombone. While at Jordan High School, Britt befriended Charles Mingus: \"very shy, and bow-legged\", and invariably the butt of jokes. Woodman taught Mingus ping-pong and continued to provide him with friendship throughout his turbulent years. He was a regular contributor to Mingus's record sessions, his connection further underlined with his presence in the Mingus Big Band during its visits to Ronnie Scott's in the 1990s. As a 17-year-old, Woodman moonlighted from school to play theatre gigs and work on the Central Avenue entertainment scene. After two years with Les Hite, then leading Los Angeles's finest big band, Woodman was conscripted into the United States Army and saw out the war as a musician stationed in North Carolina. Back in town in 1946, he hooked up with Mingus and saxophonists Buddy Collette and Lucky Thompson to form the Stars of Swing. Using advanced arrangements by Mingus and Collette, this group seemed destined for the limelight, but was short-lived and went unrecorded. When its work ran out, Woodman was snapped up by the popular bandleader Eddie Heywood and then joined Lionel Hampton. Discouraged by Hampton's requirement that his musicians wear gloves, \"act and grin and smile\", Woodman enrolled at music school for two years. Then came the call from Ellington. After the Duke, Woodman freelanced in New York, on studio sessions and one-off gigs, some with Mingus, and also helped to stabilise his friend during a traumatic incident at a 1962 Town Hall concert. After spending a decade in Los Angeles from 1970, Woodman and his wife realised that New York offered livelier opportunities. He played in many long-running Broadway shows, including Jelly's Last Jam, Black and Blue and Sophisticated Ladies. In his latter years, Woodman played in repertory orchestras sent out under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution and Lincoln Centre and appeared on the European festival circuit, often with Clark Terry. He also visited Japan with Benny Carter. Deeply religious, Woodman never pushed himself forward - indeed, he was dismissive of his skills - yet always remained busy. His presence in the Mingus Band seemed especially fitting, as he celebrated his old companion's music and soloed with the same brilliance he had always exhibited. Last year he said, \"While I can still hold the horn, I'll play.\" Sadly, he developed a severe respiratory problem while touring last October and never performed again. Woodman is survived by his elder brothers and their families. His wife, Clara, died in 1991. There were no children.",

      "body": "<p>Britain's fastest growing drugs company is almost impossible to find. Shire Pharmaceuticals is based in an old farmhouse down a narrow country lane near Andover, Hampshire, but all the signs directing visitors have been removed \"for security reasons\". </p> <p>Chief executive Rolf Stahel explains that the firm has \"had a few computers stolen\". But its low profile is also, no doubt, to do with the public's deep suspicion of big drugs firms - particularly those specialising in highly controversial drugs for psychiatric disorders. </p> <p>Once found, Shire's offices are peaceful and remote. Mr Stahel occupies what was once the farmer's front room. He says: \"We wanted to create a completely different working atmosphere. This is an area which may look calm outside but there's a storm going on inside.\" </p> <p>That is a bit of an understatement. Shire's expansion has been phenomenal - in seven years its sales have risen from $3m to $500m and its market value has jumped 177-fold to \u00a33.6bn. Last month, Shire leapt into the FTSE 100 index as the country's fourth largest drugs firm. </p> <p>Mr Stahel says: \"We're proud to be in the FTSE 100. I'd be lying to say I wasn't proud or pleased, although it was never a personal target.\" </p> <p>A Swiss national, Rolf Stahel has been running Shire since 1994, when he was headhunted from the multinational drugs conglomerate Wellcome. He began by selling Wellcome's equipment to hospitals. Mr Stahel has built Shire, to a large extent, on the back of drugs to pacify disruptive American children. The company is market leader in medicines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a condition which has polarised doctors and parents on both sides of the Atlantic. </p> <p>ADHD, according to doctors, is an imbalance in the brain which makes children scream, shout, attack their classmates and hurl their toys around. More than 4m youngsters in the US have been diagnosed with the condition and in some schools, up to a third of pupils are taking medication. Critics say the illness is over-diagnosed. Some have even claimed that the drugs industry has \"invented\" ADHD - an allegation Mr Stahel condemns as \"irresponsible and totally ill-informed\". </p> <p>Shire's two treatments, Adderall and Dextrostat, have a 36% share of the market for treating ADHD, reaping revenue of $103m (\u00a370m) in the first half of this year. They account for nearly half the company's overall sales. </p> <p>Mr Stahel has a robust response to criticism surrounding ADHD: \"You need to look at the consequences of non-treatment.\" At the severe end of the disorder, he says, children simply cannot sit still: \"They will climb over tables, chairs and cabinets. They cannot leave a room in an orderly fashion. They can't concentrate on exams, or make friends. They drop out of class and of the world of friendship and run the risk of being social outcasts.\" </p> <p>If left alone, he believes, the usual outcome will be alcoholism, unemployment and a criminal record. </p> <p>Where disagreements take place, however, is on milder cases. Mr Stahel says: \"At the lighter end, people who have the disorder do not live up to their full potential. You may have someone with A grade potential who finishes up with a C or a D. With mild doses, we can put them up to their potential.\" </p> <p>Then there is the issue of side effects. Some parents claim ADHD treatments, such as Adderall or Novartis's rival Ritalin, have made their children far more aggressive. Most seriously, the family of a man from North Dakota is suing Shire, claiming that Adderall made him hallucinate. Believing he had been instructed by God, he shot and killed his five-week-old daughter. </p> <p>Mr Stahel says: \"It says on the label that in rare cases, and I really mean rare cases, there is a possibility of psychotic incidents. One very severe accident has occurred , which the company regrets tremendously. But we are dealing with over 10m patients and one severe incident.\" </p> <p>Adderall is not available in Europe - regulators on this side of the Atlantic will not consider it because it contains three different amphetamines, contravening guidelines on stimulants. </p> <p>A recent visit to the young offenders' institution at Feltham has convinced Mr Stahel that ADHD should be taken more seriously in Britain. He says he was told that a quarter of the institution's inmates were illiterate: \"Why are they illiterate? My suspicion is that some of them probably had ADHD.\" </p> <p>He believes this is a symptom of a wider problem. \"Europe is inhibited towards brain diseases. People tend to accept we can mend a broken arm but if there's something wrong with the brain, they don't say anything about it. Parkinson's, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease - until very recently, they were all stigmatised.\" </p> <p>Building on the success of Adderall, Shire is developing a portfolio of psychiatric drugs. The most promising is Reminyl, a treatment for Alzheimer's originally formulated using daffodils. Already on sale is Carbatrol, an epilepsy treatment and further down the pipeline products for strokes and bipolar disorders. </p> <p>Mr Stahel presides over a workforce of close to 1,000. There is little science in his background. After leaving school in Lucerne, he moved to Bournemouth to learn English. With little fluency in the language, he got a job as a salesman for Wellcome. He recalls: \"They put me in north London - an area where they did not think I could do much damage. I won the prize for having the best sales after just 12 days.\" He ended up staying at Wellcome for 27 years, including a spell as boss of the group's Far Eastern operations. </p> <p>Former colleagues say he can be abrupt - a trait displayed when he asked about his \u00a34m package of pay and options: \"You will have to ask the remuneration committee. It is most unpleasant for an individual to speak about his own pay.\" </p> <p>Mr Stahel's English remains heavily accented - he is also fluent in French, German and Italian. He admits he can be ruthless: \"I don't think any manager who runs an international organisation can allow inefficiency, it spreads like cancer. I see myself as tough but fair here.\" </p> <p>Unusually for Britain's drugs industry, Shire is purely a development and marketing business. It contracts out its manufacturing, and does no initial research. The drugs are licensed in from biotech firms or rival pharmaceutical firms. </p> <p>Mr Stahel describes drug discovery as \"molecular roulette\", pointing out that only one in 10,000 discovery projects typically yields a marketable drug. This, he says is a flaw in the dream of building any biotech company into a multinational corporation: \"Statistically, you can't do it, you need to be lucky. Amgen [a leading US biotech company] were lucky but there aren't many Amgens around.\" </p> <p>The solution is for biotech firms to licence out programmes in early clinical trials, allowing bigger players - such as Shire - to share the risk. </p> <p>The company will remain concentrated on speciality diseases, making drugs prescribed by hospital consultants, rather than GPs. This smaller target group means the firm needs fewer salesmen. </p> <p>Mr Stahel says: \"The dream is to become the top speciality pharmaceuticals company in the world. I'm not promising that, but we could become one of the top three worldwide within five years.\" </p> <p>A merger last year with Roberts Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey boosted the firm's presence in America and there is a temptation for Shire to move across the Atlantic entirely. Mr Stahel says: \"Our US people suggest that regularly but my preference is to stay here. I want to strengthen our position in Europe and Japan.\" </p> <p>There will be a move, however, from the firm's rural idyll. As a FTSE 100 company, it has outgrown its farmhouse and is developing more mundane premises near Basingstoke. Mr Stahel is, for a moment, nostalgic: \"It's a shame in a way, the romantic side has been lost.\"</p>",

People tend to accept we can mend a broken arm but if there's something wrong with the brain, they don't say anything about it. Parkinson's, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease - until very recently, they were all stigmatised.\" Building on the success of Adderall, Shire is developing a portfolio of psychiatric drugs. The most promising is Reminyl, a treatment for Alzheimer's originally formulated using daffodils. Already on sale is Carbatrol, an epilepsy treatment and further down the pipeline products for strokes and bipolar disorders. Mr Stahel presides over a workforce of close to 1,000. There is little science in his background. After leaving school in Lucerne, he moved to Bournemouth to learn English. With little fluency in the language, he got a job as a salesman for Wellcome. He recalls: \"They put me in north London - an area where they did not think I could do much damage. I won the prize for having the best sales after just 12 days.\" He ended up staying at Wellcome for 27 years, including a spell as boss of the group's Far Eastern operations. Former colleagues say he can be abrupt - a trait displayed when he asked about his \u00a34m package of pay and options: \"You will have to ask the remuneration committee. It is most unpleasant for an individual to speak about his own pay.\" Mr Stahel's English remains heavily accented - he is also fluent in French, German and Italian. He admits he can be ruthless: \"I don't think any manager who runs an international organisation can allow inefficiency, it spreads like cancer. I see myself as tough but fair here.\" Unusually for Britain's drugs industry, Shire is purely a development and marketing business. It contracts out its manufacturing, and does no initial research. The drugs are licensed in from biotech firms or rival pharmaceutical firms. Mr Stahel describes drug discovery as \"molecular roulette\", pointing out that only one in 10,000 discovery projects typically yields a marketable drug. This, he says is a flaw in the dream of building any biotech company into a multinational corporation: \"Statistically, you can't do it, you need to be lucky. Amgen [a leading US biotech company] were lucky but there aren't many Amgens around.\" The solution is for biotech firms to licence out programmes in early clinical trials, allowing bigger players - such as Shire - to share the risk. The company will remain concentrated on speciality diseases, making drugs prescribed by hospital consultants, rather than GPs. This smaller target group means the firm needs fewer salesmen. Mr Stahel says: \"The dream is to become the top speciality pharmaceuticals company in the world. I'm not promising that, but we could become one of the top three worldwide within five years.\" A merger last year with Roberts Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey boosted the firm's presence in America and there is a temptation for Shire to move across the Atlantic entirely. Mr Stahel says: \"Our US people suggest that regularly but my preference is to stay here. I want to strengthen our position in Europe and Japan.\" There will be a move, however, from the firm's rural idyll. As a FTSE 100 company, it has outgrown its farmhouse and is developing more mundane premises near Basingstoke. Mr Stahel is, for a moment, nostalgic: \"It's a shame in a way, the romantic side has been lost.\"",

The alarm had been raised by Stephen Downing, a 17-year-old with learning difficulties, who was working as a gardener in the graveyard .</p> <p>He guided police to the spot, then pointed out the murder weapon, a pickaxe handle lying on the cemetery path.</p> <p>Stephen was charged with assault, then murder when the 32-year-old typist died of her injuries.</p> <p>His motive? The youth who had never had a girlfriend confessed to police that he had indecently assaulted the attractive young secretary. The jury at his trial, at Nottingham crown court in 1974, took just one hour to reach a guilty verdict.</p> <p>Stephen's police statement, in which he also admitted battering Wendy with the pickaxe handle, had formed \"the main plank of evidence for the prosecution,\" the judge said.</p> <p>For the next 20 years, that was that. Stephen was moved from prison to prison, where he was stabbed, scalded with hot water and beaten up. His parents, stunned by the verdict and convinced their son was innocent, lobbied successive home secretaries and enlisted the support of their MPs, but to no avail.</p> <p>Stephen, who had retracted his confession by the time of the trial, could have walked free by 1991 - the judge had set a 17-year tariff - but he insisted on claiming innocence.</p> <p>He was classified by the Home Office as an IDOM - a prisoner \"in denial of murder\" - which meant he could not be released. Now, 27 years later, Stephen appears likely to be freed after the Criminal Cases Review Commission referred the case back to the court of appeal.</p> <p>If, as expected, his conviction is ruled unsafe, it will be Britain's longest-running miscarriage of justice.</p> <p>Stephen's luck turned in 1994 when an enterprising journalist took an interest in the case. Don Hale, editor of the Matlock Mercury, uncovered the astonishing story of how a collective act of denial appeared to have put an innocent man behind bars.</p> <p>He found scores of witnesses in Bakewell - a genteel market town so small that Stephen's parents occasionally bump into the victim's mother at the shops - who could clear Stephen and point to another man, who was still alive and living locally.</p> <p>And he uncovered the outline of another motive for Wendy Sewell's murder, one which lay in her complicated love life.</p> <p>As Mr Hale started to delve more deeply, he became increasingly certain that he had found out the real story of the cemetery murder and realised that many people in the town had known it all along.</p> <p>Wendy Sewell, who worked as a typist for the forestry commission, was a married woman. Her husband David still lives near Bakewell. That much the jury at Stephen's trial knew. What they were not told was that she also had a string of boyfriends, some married and some of them from influential local families.</p> <p>Later, the tabloids would cruelly dub her \"the Bakewell Tart\". Local gossip claims that she kept a diary of her lovers, giving them \"scores\". Whatever the truth of that, it is well-established that four years before the murder, she bore a son to one of her lovers. The boy was adopted and lives abroad.</p> <p>Her mother insists her daughter was a \"good lass\" and says the sex stories are lies.</p> <p>But Mr Hale spoke to locals, including former lovers, who suggested she might have been playing her boyfriends off against each other.</p> <p>On that crisp September morning in 1973, Wendy left a note saying she was going for a breath of fresh air and walked out of the office in Bakewell at about 12.40pm. Ten minutes later she was seen walking up a steep path known as the Butts to the cemetery.</p> <p>Stephen was finishing up at the graveyard before his lunchbreak. The \"slow\" lad was a familiar figure locally and was noticed as he walked in his typical shambling manner out of the cemetery to his family home nearby, where he fed his pet hedgehogs and spoke to his mother.</p> <p>The jury at Stephen's trial were told that Wendy had gone up to look at her father's gravestone. But a witness who did not come forward for the trial told Mr Hale she saw Wendy walking about in the cemetery and embracing a man.</p> <p>The witness - schoolgirl Jane Bentley - had gone to the cemetery to fetch the family dog when she saw Stephen leaving for his break. Then she saw Wendy with the man, who had sandy-coloured, shoulder-length hair and was wearing a denim jacket and jeans.</p> <p>Walking out of the graveyard, Jane heard a cry for help, but dismissed it, thinking that a group of nearby workmen were larking about.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Stephen, the girl ran away from home shortly after the murder because of family problems and eventually came to live in a foster home some miles away.</p> <p>She only came forward after reading of the trial in a local newspaper and realising her evidence placed Stephen outside the cemetery at the time of the murder.</p> <p>She offered to give evidence at the appeal, heard in November 1974, but her statement was dismissed as police said she had got the wrong day. Jane disagreed. She remembers wearing her school uniform and September 12 was the first day of term.</p> <p>Another witness described a blood-stained man - not Stephen - running out of the cemetery that day \"like a bat out of hell.\"</p> <p>Some of those Mr Hale spoke to said they gone to police with their evidence, but had been dismissed. The detectives felt they had got their man. Others said they had been too frightened to come forward before.</p> <p>The evidence emerging 20 years later amounted to a collective outpouring of remorse. One woman wrote to him anonymously telling how she had been with a lover in woods by the cemetery that day and heard shouting.</p> <p>She described seeing a man running away and then Stephen arriving at the graveyard, and bending over Wendy's battered body.</p> <p>The letter writer had not gone to the police in 1973 because she feared her husband would have discovered the affair. Her letter ended with the words: \"I am writing to you in the hope that you can look into this and clear this young man's name and put the right one behind bars.\"</p> <p>Mr Hale said: \"When I went door knocking, asking questions of previous witnesses, they were saying 'Thank God someone has taken this on.'</p> <p>\"For 20-odd years people had just done nothing - but they knew who had done it. It was unbelievable. A conspiracy of silence.\"</p> <p>The editor had moved to Derbyshire from the north-west in 1985 and had not been aware of the case until Stephen's parents, Ray and Juanita, contacted him in September 1994.</p> <p>When he turned to examining records of the trial and investigation, he was deeply disturbed.</p> <p>Stephen, who had a reading age of 11 at the time, was taken to Bakewell police station at 2pm that afternoon.

      "body": "<p>Dragomir Vasic has agreed to meet us at Radio Osvit, a small local radio station in Zvornik, eastern Bosnia. We sit waiting for him in the tiny smoky office of the editor, Zorana. She drinks plum brandy; we sip orangeade and thick Turkish coffee - Serbian coffee, you are wise to call it in these parts.</p> <p>\"Osvit\" means the first light of dawn, the moment when devout Muslims begin their first prayers of the day. But there are no Muslims left in Zvornik. Before the war they were the majority: 48,208 in a population of 81,111 according to the 1991 census. But in April, May and June 1992 they were all killed or expelled. The stairwells of the shabby blocks of flats along the river Drina were slippery with their blood. Their mosques were blown up and the rubble removed, to the last stone.</p> <p>Mr Vasic appears in the doorway. He is younger than I expected, 36, dressed in dark trousers and a grey sweatshirt. I suggest that we go somewhere more comfortable. We follow his black Opel Vectra to a small restaurant close to the Drina. On the far bank is Serbia.</p> <p>Men at a table go silent as we enter. Serbian folk music plays on the radio in the background. As we sit down I notice beads of sweat on Mr Vasic's forehead. There is also a scar, running vertically upwards from his right eye.</p> <p>He asks me what I want. I take two papers from my notebook. He takes a poorly typed, single page translation of the same text from his pocket.</p> <p>\"Dragomir Vasic allegedly participated in organising the 1992 ethnic cleansing of Zvornik, including the transfer of Bosniaks [Bosnian Muslims] from Bijeli Potok to concentration camps, and the disappearance of about 750 Bosniaks...</p> <p>\"He is also alleged to have participated in organising the torture and rape of Bosniak women in the Djulici mosque, and the expulsion and deportation of the non-Serb civilian population of Djulici [a village near Zvornik]. After the initial ethnic cleansing, Vasic served as the chief of police in Zvornik, from 1993 to 1998, during which time he allegedly played a significant role in the massacres and ethnic cleansing of Srebrenica.\"</p> <p>The passage is from a report on war crimes just published by the influential thinktank, the International Crisis Group (ICG). Compiled from witness accounts, intelligence files, and leaks from international organisations, it also accuses UN representatives in Bosnia of knowingly appeasing mass murderers.</p> <p>\"This has nothing to do with the truth,\" he says quietly. \"I have agreed to talk to you to express my innocence.\"</p> <p>There is fear in his brown eyes. I suggest we talk about politics first. After all, he is an elected representative of the people. He warms to the theme.</p> <p>\"I am a popular man in this town. Ten thousand people voted for me. Would they have chosen a person responsible for such things?\"</p> <p>Like the 74 other people named in the ICG report, Mr Vasic is not some fugitive hiding in the Bosnian mountains, surrounded by bodyguards. He is a local politician, a representative of the Serbian Democratic party on the Zvornik council: the party which declared war on Bosnia, in April 1992; the party which won last Saturday's general election in the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia.</p> <p>His candidacy was approved by the Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe, which supervised the elections. He lives peacefully at home with his wife and children.</p> <p>He says he first arrived in Zvornik, on June 2 or 3 1992, then served in the army, until March 1993, when he was appointed chief of police.</p> <p>\"Were you at Djulici?\"</p> <p>\"I was at the front line at that time, eight to 10km [five to six miles] away from Djulici. I have never been inside that mosque.\"</p> <p>He is agitated. My interpreter, too, is trembling; stumbling over the words.</p> <p>\"Did you organise the torture and rape of women and girls in that mosque?\"</p> <p>\"Look. I have three children of my own; two girls. Everyone in the town knows me. I would rather kill myself than do something like that.\"</p> <p>\"How do you explain these allegations against you?\"</p> <p>\"Some individuals are trying to blame me for the crimes they committed.\"</p> <p>\"Local people?\"</p> <p>\"Yes. Powerful people. I know who they are, but I don't want to say their names.\"</p> <p>The men at the next table are staring at us.</p> <p>\"At the start of the war here there was no organised army. There were individuals who were out of control. Do not try to blame Vasic for everything that happened.\" He uses his own name, as though he were speaking about someone else.</p> <p>\"It is different if I commit a crime, or order the committing of a crime.

      "bodyText": "Dragomir Vasic has agreed to meet us at Radio Osvit, a small local radio station in Zvornik, eastern Bosnia. We sit waiting for him in the tiny smoky office of the editor, Zorana. She drinks plum brandy; we sip orangeade and thick Turkish coffee - Serbian coffee, you are wise to call it in these parts. \"Osvit\" means the first light of dawn, the moment when devout Muslims begin their first prayers of the day. But there are no Muslims left in Zvornik. Before the war they were the majority: 48,208 in a population of 81,111 according to the 1991 census. But in April, May and June 1992 they were all killed or expelled. The stairwells of the shabby blocks of flats along the river Drina were slippery with their blood. Their mosques were blown up and the rubble removed, to the last stone. Mr Vasic appears in the doorway. He is younger than I expected, 36, dressed in dark trousers and a grey sweatshirt. I suggest that we go somewhere more comfortable. We follow his black Opel Vectra to a small restaurant close to the Drina. On the far bank is Serbia. Men at a table go silent as we enter. Serbian folk music plays on the radio in the background. As we sit down I notice beads of sweat on Mr Vasic's forehead. There is also a scar, running vertically upwards from his right eye. He asks me what I want. I take two papers from my notebook. He takes a poorly typed, single page translation of the same text from his pocket. \"Dragomir Vasic allegedly participated in organising the 1992 ethnic cleansing of Zvornik, including the transfer of Bosniaks [Bosnian Muslims] from Bijeli Potok to concentration camps, and the disappearance of about 750 Bosniaks... \"He is also alleged to have participated in organising the torture and rape of Bosniak women in the Djulici mosque, and the expulsion and deportation of the non-Serb civilian population of Djulici [a village near Zvornik]. After the initial ethnic cleansing, Vasic served as the chief of police in Zvornik, from 1993 to 1998, during which time he allegedly played a significant role in the massacres and ethnic cleansing of Srebrenica.\" The passage is from a report on war crimes just published by the influential thinktank, the International Crisis Group (ICG). Compiled from witness accounts, intelligence files, and leaks from international organisations, it also accuses UN representatives in Bosnia of knowingly appeasing mass murderers. \"This has nothing to do with the truth,\" he says quietly. \"I have agreed to talk to you to express my innocence.\" There is fear in his brown eyes. I suggest we talk about politics first. After all, he is an elected representative of the people. He warms to the theme. \"I am a popular man in this town. Ten thousand people voted for me. Would they have chosen a person responsible for such things?\" Like the 74 other people named in the ICG report, Mr Vasic is not some fugitive hiding in the Bosnian mountains, surrounded by bodyguards. He is a local politician, a representative of the Serbian Democratic party on the Zvornik council: the party which declared war on Bosnia, in April 1992; the party which won last Saturday's general election in the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia. His candidacy was approved by the Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe, which supervised the elections. He lives peacefully at home with his wife and children. He says he first arrived in Zvornik, on June 2 or 3 1992, then served in the army, until March 1993, when he was appointed chief of police. \"Were you at Djulici?\" \"I was at the front line at that time, eight to 10km [five to six miles] away from Djulici. I have never been inside that mosque.\" He is agitated. My interpreter, too, is trembling; stumbling over the words. \"Did you organise the torture and rape of women and girls in that mosque?\" \"Look. I have three children of my own; two girls. Everyone in the town knows me. I would rather kill myself than do something like that.\" \"How do you explain these allegations against you?\" \"Some individuals are trying to blame me for the crimes they committed.\" \"Local people?\" \"Yes. Powerful people. I know who they are, but I don't want to say their names.\" The men at the next table are staring at us. \"At the start of the war here there was no organised army. There were individuals who were out of control. Do not try to blame Vasic for everything that happened.\" He uses his own name, as though he were speaking about someone else. \"It is different if I commit a crime, or order the committing of a crime. If someone says, 'Vasic told me to do this.' And it is different if he says, 'He didn't prevent it.' You have to know first what was going on. It's another thing to stand in front of someone who is armed. If I had been there, I would be guilty. But I was 10km away. How could I be responsible?\" A little later he looks straight at me. \"As a man, do you think I did these things? Tell me honestly.\" Before we part, on the banks of the Drina, he lets me write down two more sentences: \"I made mistakes when I allowed myself to be used as a tool of people with political aims, but my conscience is clear. I never did anything which would make me or my family ashamed.\" Mr Vasic has not been publicly indicted by the Hague tribunal examining war crimes in former Yugoslavia: only 64 people have. A handful of others have been secretly indicted. No one has been charged with the crimes committed at the beginning of the war in eastern Bosnia. In 1992-95, 200,000 people died and many thousands more were raped and tortured. The number of war crimes suspects on the database of the state war crimes commission in Sarajevo is 31,000. \"With the current pace of justice,\" said James Lyon, director of the ICG in Sarajevo, \"and given the lack of political will of the international community... I see them getting off scot-free, unpunished.\"",

A string of profits warnings and disappointing sales figures since the spring wiped about $25bn from its stock market value.

American consumers, loaded with long-standing high levels of debt, appear to have reined in their spending in the past few months. The US central bankhelped this trend by raising interest rates to a nine-year high in May and keeping them there this week. </p> <p>Americans, half of whom own shares, have also taken the stock market's slump as a cue to think twice about buying that extra pair of jeans. Even with unemployment at a 30-year low, the crash in the value of technology shares has wiped out much of the paper wealth that led to feel-good spending sprees. Economists say continuing uncertainty over the election is adding to the sense of unease. </p> <p>So, while Americans may still be spending heavily on sports utility vehicles and refrigerators, they are increasingly making do with their existing wardrobe. Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Strategic Retail, says: \"A combination of the economy and the elections are making consumers nervous. That sort of nervousness hits the retail sector across the board, but it hits apparel first.\" </p> <p>While several retailers, including Best Buy and Lands End, have suffered from the downturn in consumer confidence, others seem relatively unscathed. Low-cost operators such as Wal-Mart, a direct competitor to Old Navy, are doing well while queues of teenagers fill H&amp;M and Zara, the European clothing stores that have recently expanded in the US. </p> <p>For Gap a slowing economy highlighted internal problems of uninspiring merchandise and poor management. After blaming a combination of the economic slowdown and bad weather earlier in the year, executives recently admitted to inventory problems, heavy markdowns and a dispiriting advertising campaign which focused on in-store promotions rather than brand-building slots on television. </p> <p>Analysts knew things were bad when, during the busy back-to-school period, the company was offering 20% discounts. Gap seldom touts cut-price offers. </p> <p>In a statement accompanying the third- quarter results, Micky Drexler, the chief executive, said: \"We're moving quickly to fix our problems and make sure we execute more consistently.\" A new television advertising campaign for Gap and Old Navy started this week and the company says it has cleared up the inventory problems which led to late deliveries. </p> <p>The group is also looking to appoint new heads of marketing for Gap and Old Navy and a head of product design for Banana Republic. </p> <p>In September, Mr Drexler told investors at a Goldman Sachs conference that the problems were temporary. \"In spite of the short term screw-ups we've been through, the fundamental issues in our brands have not changed. We still have three incredibly strong, powerful brands we feel have exciting long term opportunities.\" </p> <p>Many analysts believe the company made a mistake by trying to attract teenagers looking for trendy clothes. \"Gap moved away from its core strengths and it needs to get them back,\" says Todd Slater, retail analyst at Lazard Brothers in New York. These strengths are reasonably priced but good quality basics rather than turquoise suede capri pants. </p> <p>Fashion editors concur that the current offering is unlikely to provide much of a lift. \"They have a purple and pumpkin problem,\" said one magazine writer of the chain's seasonal colours. </p> <p>The outlook for the all-important run-up to Christmas is therefore looking less than cheery. \"The holiday is all but written off\" is the Lazard verdict. Slater expects Gap to earn $345.8m in the three months to the end of January, 16% less than last year. </p> <p>Shareholders have criticised the management team, but have stopped short of demanding any serious reorganisation so far. The board is also understood to have the backing of the founding Fisher family, which still owns 30% of the company. Donald Fisher is chairman of the company but gave up some executive responsibility last year. </p> <p>Ms Liebmann is also optimistic in the longer term. \"Gap goes through four- or five-year cycles when, after incredible highs, everybody has enough casual stuff. Then, all at once, Gap comes up with something and it starts again.\" If so, the litmus test will not seem quite so acidic. </p> <p><strong>Sewing up the market</strong></p> <p>In 1969, Donald Fisher and his wife Doris opened a shop in San Francisco which they called The Gap after the <strong> generation gap</strong>. The shop targeted teenagers and students at the nearby state university.

Local street traders have rioted against the foreigners, accusing them of stealing trade and smashing their stalls and looting their goods. Immigrants are frequently beaten up and occasionally killed. Two years ago, three Senegalese men were murdered on a crowded Pretoria train. Others have met \"accidental\" deaths in police custody. \"Life is very difficult in South Africa,\" said Alice Mdakane, who sells vegetables on a Johannesburg street. \"Why do these people want to come here and take our business? How are we going to feed our children? Do we go to their countries and steal their work? They should go home where they belong.\" Migrants from countries such as Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Angola - which gave refuge to tens of thousands of black South Africans, and support to the ANC during the apartheid years - are particularly resentful at the rejection they now face. In July, the International Organisation for Migration told racism hearings by the human rights commission that the problem was deepening. \"Black South Africans do not easily accept black Africans - they are at best tolerated and at worst brutalised and marginalised,\" it said. Jody Kollapen, a human rights commissioner who wrote a report on the new xenophobia, says the government and police are responsible for inflaming the persecution by blaming immigrants for an array of social problems. \"Ministers and senior police officers have often sought to prescribe the problem of escalating crime to immigrants without any evidence whatsoever. I wouldn't want to call it official prejudice, but it exists...The question is whether officialdom is being led by public sentiment or whether it is officialdom that is legitimising public sentiment,\" he said. Those illegal immigrants who find themselves in custody invariably end up in the notorious Lindela deportation centre in Krugersdorp, west of Johannesburg. The centre has been denounced repeatedly in official reports and by human rights groups for the high levels of physical abuse by guards and corruption. About two-thirds of those detained come from neighbouring Mozambique. They are loaded on to a special train each Thursday, headed for Maputo. One in three do not make it. The going rate for a bribe to a guard to be allowed to leap off the moving train is 200 rand (\u00a318). Revealingly, one in 10 people in Lindela claim to be South Africans who failed to produce identity documents during arbitrary, and therefore unlawful, sweeps by the police to catch illegal aliens. But there are no white people detained at Lindela. Ms Maniraho and Ms Chitula were eventually released from the centre after relatives were able to produce their residency papers, but in Ms Chitula's case it took nearly two weeks before she was even allowed to make a telephone call from Lindela camp.",

      "bodyText": "At least 113 people have died and more than 400 are in hospital in Nairobi after drinking a poisonous batch of illegal home-brew. As victims continued to arrive at the Kenyatta national hospital from various parts of the city yesterday, doctors said that many of them would die and many more would be permanently blinded. The hospital director said that 30 were in a critical condition. The illicit spirit, a crude gin known as chang'aa , had been laced with the industrial alcohol methanol, apparently to give it an extra kick. Methanol corrodes the stomach lining and causes liver and kidney failure as well as blindness. The police raided a warehouse early yesterday and arrested a man on suspicion of illegally supplying the chemical. Twelve women were arrested for selling the doctored brew. The Nairobi slums which house at least half of the capital's 3m people are packed with illegal drinking dens -shebeens - typically run by elderly widows who compete for business by boasting of the potency of their brew. \"Our children, relatives and neighbours are dying for a mere 10 bob [shillings]\", Justus Nduati said as he carried his unconscious teenage daughter into the hospital. \"We have tried to urge the government to stop the selling of these brews, but our pleas usually fall on deaf ears.\" A glass of chang'aa costs 10 Kenyan shillings (10p); a bottle of beer at least 50 shillings. The poisoned batch went on sale on Tuesday: the following morning bodies littering the gutter outside a well-known shebeen. Taxi drivers carried scores of people to hospital, some of them handing over their shoes in payment. But despite publicity about the spirit's dangers, the police said, people were still drinking it. \"We are sending word to those who may have drunk it to visit the nearest hospital,\" a spokesman said. \"These [drinkers] do not seem to be listening to what the government has warned. We have had cases of this nature before, but never as serious as this one.\" Last year more than 6,000 Kenyans died as a result of drinking illegal spirits.

The 174 ILO members, from the private and public sectors, are being asked to \"review their relations\" with Burma's military rulers from next month.

The decision was approved by an overwhelming majority of the ILO's governments and trade unions, and received the unanimous backing of its employers' associations. This will give legal weight to international boycotts as well as more traditional government-sponsored sanctions. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions urged tour operators to cancel trips because Burmese workers are being forced to develop its tourist infrastructure. The move followed three years of ILO attempts to persuade Burma's military leaders to stop the \"widespread and systematic\" use of forced labour, during which workers have been raped, beaten and physically abused by soldiers, and porters have been sent out to test minefields.

For Mandela, the greatness of Chinua Achebe, founding father of the modern African novel in English, lies in his having \"brought Africa to the world\" while remaining rooted as an African. As the Nigerian Achebe used his pen to free the continent from its past, said the former South African president, \"both of us, in our differing circumstances within the context of white domination of our continent, became freedom fighters\". </p> <p>Mandela's tribute was videoed in honour of Achebe's 70th birthday on Thursday, and sent to leafy Bard College in upstate New York, where Achebe is professor of languages and literature. The professor, born into the 10m-strong Igbo nation of eastern Nigeria, sat through a two-day celebration in the red fez-like hat of the Igbo elder. He was sent greetings from the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, and Nigeria's first civilian leader in 16 years, President Olusegun Obasanjo, and homage was paid by fellow writers, including three Nobel laureates: Toni Morrison, Wole Soyinka and, in absentia, Nadine Gordimer. It is rare, Achebe remarked later with gentle irony, to hear such concerted singing of your praises \"unless you're a Third World dictator\". </p> <p>Achebe has suffered for challenging just such strongmen in Nigeria. But his present exile has a different cause. In March 1990, only weeks after attending a gathering that anticipated his 60th birthday in the eastern Nigerian town of Nsukka, a car crash on the country's lethal roads left him paralysed from the waist down, and in a wheelchair. He was airlifted to Britain for surgery (\"the damage was so severe they didn't think I'd survive\"), told he would never walk again, and advised to move for therapy to the US, where he took up a professorship at Bard, in Annandale-on-Hudson. </p> <p>\"I thought I'd go home after a year,\" he recalls in his clapboard bungalow on campus. \"But home has simply got from bad to worse in terms of hospital facilities. I've had severe infections, and you need proper antibiotics, not fakes. When you say a country has broken down, that's what it means.\" The annulment of Nigeria's elections in 1993 by President Ibrahim Babangida militated against his return. A subsequent coup by General Sani Abacha brought even harsher dictatorship - marked by the hanging of the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995. Last year's return to democracy has scarcely begun to reverse the country's decline. </p> <p>This summer in the US, Achebe brought out a volume of essays, Home And Exile, to be published in Britain in January. In it, he hankers for the homeland where his fiction is rooted - \"where I could see my work cut out for me\". He places his oeuvre within Salman Rushdie's notion of \"the empire writes back\": postcolonial writers countering Europe's fictions by seizing the right to tell their own story. </p> <p>Achebe is known across continents for his landmark first novel, Things Fall Apart (1958), a tale told \"from the inside\" about the destructive impact of European Christianity on precolonial Igbo culture amid the scramble for Africa in the 1890s. Published on the eve of Nigerian independence in 1960 when its author was 28, it helped reshape literature in the English-speaking world, but it was not the first novel by an African: precursors included fellow Nigerians Amos Tutuola and Cyprian Ekwensi, South Africa's Peter Abrahams and, in French, Senegal's Ousmane Sembene and Cameroon's Camera Laye. It has sold more than 10m copies internationally and been translated into 45 languages, making it one of the most widely read novels of the 20th century. A biography by Ezenwa-Ohaeto was published in 1997 (published by James Currey). </p> <p>For Soyinka, Things Fall Apart was \"the first novel in English which spoke from the interior of an African character, rather than portraying the African as exotic, as the white man would see him\". Nigeria's two literary giants are friends, though rivalry is often assumed: the critic Chinweizu deems Achebe superior in \"decolonising the mind\", while oth ers judge Soyinka's politics more \"radical\". When Soyinka won Africa's first Nobel for literature in 1986, Achebe warmly congratulated him, but put the Swedish accolade in perspective as a \"European prize\". Last year they were billed with Derek Walcott at the Word festival in London's Hackney Empire as \"two Nobel laureates and a legend\". </p> <p>Another Nobel laureate, Toni Morrison, says Achebe sparked her \"love affair with African literature\" and was a major influence on her beginnings as a writer. \"He inhabited his world in a way that I didn't inhabit mine - the things he could take for granted - insisting on writing outside the white gaze, not against it,\" she says. \"His courage and generosity were made manifest in the work; and that's difficult to do: to talk about devastation and evil in such a way that the text itself isn't evil or devastating.\" </p> <p>Achebe's arguments are delivered with force but in a deceptively soft voice. Though he can seem melancholic, his talk is punctuated by laughter and shafts of dry humour. As his birthday showed, he can bring together people who agree on nothing but their affection for him. Chinweizu, of a Nigerian school of critics known as the Bolekaja Boys (street slang for \"jump up and fight\"), sat alongside Soyinka, whom they once pilloried as a \"Euro-assimilationist\". They were in turn put down as \"neo-tarzanist primitivists\". Soyinka shared a platform with his intellectual sparring partner, the historian Ali Mazrui, as they declared themselves on their \"best behaviour\". </p> <p>In Home And Exile, Achebe has stepped further into autobiography. \"Maybe that's what turning 70 does, though I don't feel any different; you tend to move in the direction of memoir. The ideas I wanted to pursue took an autobiographical turn because the final authority I could bring was that of my own experience.\" </p> <p>He was born in 1930 in Ogidi, an Igbo village near the Niger, 400 miles east of Lagos. The fifth of six children, he was baptised Albert Chinualumogu, but \"dropped the tribute to Victorian England\". His father, Isaiah, was a Christian convert and evangelist, with \"gallows humour\". He and Achebe's mother, Janet, were \"ardent followers, but not fanatical\"; while the family sang hymns, Isaiah's relatives offered food to what he considered idols. \"An accommodation with the church developed after initial struggle,\" says Achebe. \"Common sense and the strength of Igbo culture slowly reasserted themselves.\" </p> <p>His parents were \"extremely profound people, of few words but strong convictions; great believers in education\"; with little resources, they sent their children to school. Chike Momah, a classmate, recalls Albert Achebe as a brilliant conversationalist - a trait shared with his father - and says his headmaster predicted \"he would make the rain that would drench us all\". </p> <p>\"We lived at the crossroads of cultures\", wrote Achebe, who learned English at eight and whose passport declared him a British Protected Person (\"an arrogant lie because I never did ask anyone to protect me\"). He contrasts the slow, quiet education of his home village with the louder, formal education of mission school. \"I knew I wanted to understand the life of the society, the stories and masquerades,\" he says. \"It's curious how brainwashed we were; quite a bit of my growing up was discovering that fact.\" </p> <p>In a 1973 essay, Named For Victoria, Queen Of England, he describes Things Fall Apart as \"an act of atonement with my past, the ritual return and homage of a prodigal son\". He says: \"It's that fascination with the scraps and pieces of information I could gather about my ancestors that developed into a desire to write my story. Colonial education was saying there was nothing worth much in my society, and I was beginning to question that, to see there were things that were beautiful even in the 'heathen'.\" </p> <p>Enrolled at Ibadan university to study medicine (\"a false step\"), Achebe switched to the arts. In the new essay \"Home Under Imperial Fire\", he describes how he was spurred to write partly by being made to read Joyce Cary's 1939 novel Mister Johnson, with its \"bumbling idiot\" of a Nigerian character: \"It began to dawn on me that although fiction was undoubtedly fictitious, it could also be true or false.\" He explains: \"I'd read so-called 'African novels' in school, by Rider Haggard and John Buchan, in which white people were surrounded by savages but managed to come out on top. But I didn't recognise them as relating to me until I read Mister Johnson: this book was not talking about a vague place called Africa but about southern Nigeria. I said, 'wait, that means here; this is our story'. It brought the whole thing home to me: this story is not true, so is it possible the others are not either? It opened up a new way of looking at literature.\" </p> <p>That \"landmark rebellion\" caught a wider moment. \"The 50s were also the time when the ferment for freedom was at its highest. India was independent, so it was only a matter of time for west Africa. The second world war was fought for freedom; when they told us to collect pine kernels for the war effort, they said each one would put a nail in Hitler's coffin. Nigerians returning home from the war asked, 'where's the freedom we were told about?' So the two things were together: the political ferment and the revolution in the classroom.\" Achebe credits Amos Tutuola's The Palm-Wine Drinkard (1952) with opening \"the floodgates to modern west African writing\" in the 50s. \"It's as if this thing was waiting to be told; the time was ripe,\" he says. </p> <p>The precolonial society of Things Fall Apart, whose tragic hero Okonkwo mounts doomed resistance to encroaching European power, was far from idyllic. Achebe insists on \"an unflinching consciousness of the flaws that blemished our inheritance\". He says: \"Of all the things I remember, that was the clearest: I must not make this story look nicer than it was. I went out of my way to gather all the negative things, to describe them as I think they were - good and bad - and ordinary human beings as neither demons nor angels. I dare anybody to say, 'these people are not human'.\" </p> <p>He wrote in English, as arguments against using the language of the coloniser were gathering steam. \"It was part of the logic of my situation - like the inevitability of my writing at all - of countering stories about us in the same language in which they were written. Writing in English is a painful choice. But you don't take up a language in order to punish it; that language becomes part of you. And you can't use language at a distance; you introduce English and Igbo into a conversation, as they are in my daily life - that's fascinating.\" The Igbo art of storytelling became central to the tale, since \"proverbs are the palm oil with which words are eaten\". Achebe, who writes poetry in both Igbo and English, says, \"I insist on both\". </p> <p>For the critic Simon Gikandi, Achebe showed that \"the future of African writing did not lie in sim ple imitation of European forms but in the fusion of such forms with oral traditions\". Kwame Anthony Appiah, professor of Afro-American studies and philosophy at Harvard, says Achebe \"solved with deceptive ease difficult technical questions, such as how you represent the language of one society in the language of a very different one. His use of a variety of registers of English came to be seen as obvious; it set modern African literature in English on a certain path.\" The Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o, who in the 80s renounced writing fiction in English in favour of Gikuyu, believes \"Achebe created a third position out of the tension between Igbo and English, which becomes the base of his creativity; you feel there's an African voice in his work being rendered in English.\" </p> <p> After working as a radio producer, Achebe had come to London in 1957 to train at the BBC staff school. \"It was the first time I saw the great British empire at close quarters, and it brought England a couple of pegs down: to find a white man in dirty overalls filling holes in the road was unbelievable.\" He sent the longhand manuscript of Things Fall Apart to William Heinemann, where a reader pronounced it \"the best first novel since the war\". But at a time when many in the metropolis believed, according to the publisher James Currey, that \"an African could not reach the standards of an English publishing house\", a modest 2,000 hardbacks were printed. </p> <p>Then in 1962 Heinemann Educational Books launched the African Writers Series with four novels, including Things Fall Apart and its sequel, No Longer At Ease - set on the cusp of independence, in the era of Okonkwo's grandson. It was an inexpensive paperback imprint that emulated the Penguin revolution down to its orange covers, while selling 80% of copies in Africa and keeping titles in print. It proved that a readership existed, and was a signal for Africa's writers, says Achebe, who selected the first 100 titles. </p> <p>He was able to do what was an unpaid job as series editor for 10 years because he had jobs in broadcasting, and then academia. (The late Heinemann director Alan Hill recalled him as \"the very image of a modern Nigerian yuppie\", with sharp suit, dark glasses and a Jaguar.) \"I thought it was of the utmost importance,\" Achebe explains. \"People in England were sceptical, so I knew I was a conspirator. I was naive enough to think that if you do good work, you'll get your reward in heaven.\" </p> <p>For Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Achebe \"made a whole generation of African people believe in themselves and in the possibility of their being writers\". The Somali novelist Nuruddin Farah says he learned his craft from him: \"He taught us a way of integrating what we know from being African with what we've become - hybrids of a kind.\" </p> <p>After travelling through southern Africa on a Rockefeller scholarship in 1960, \"the winds of change in my sails\", (vexing the Northern Rhodesian authorities by sitting in the front of a segregated bus near Victoria Falls), Achebe became the first director of Voice of Nigeria, the state-run radio's external arm, where he remained till the eve of the Biafran war in 1966. He met his wife to be, Christie Chinwe, then a student, in Broadcasting House in Lagos, where she had a holiday job. She later became a professor. </p> <p>The couple have two sons and two daughters (one of whom, Chinelo, is a writer), and two grandchildren. \"Christie saves my life every other day,\" says Achebe. \"And she suffers my pain more than I do. When I had the accident, she left her classroom and never really got back.\" Though she is now a psychology professor at Bard, she was forced to leave her field of education, a sacrifice Achebe feels keenly. \"When I was drifting in and out of consciousness I remember saying I wanted her to go with me - to England. That's been her life ever since.\" </p> <p>After his third novel, Arrow of God (1964), set in Igboland in the 1920s - which won the Jock Campbell New Statesman award - Achebe wrote a satire on corruption in a fictitious African country following the \"collusive swindle that was independence\". A Man Of The People (1966) proved prescient about Nigeria's first attempted coup, which happened two days before its publication. Some thought the author complicit in the Igbo-instigated coup. He obviously wasn't. As massacres spread against Igbos in northern and western Nigeria, Achebe and his family went into hiding. They fled Lagos for Igboland, where Achebe took up a post at the university in Nsukka. </p> <p>On the eve of the Biafran war of 1967-70, Achebe went on a peace-seeking mission to President Leopold Senghor of Senegal, founder-poet of the francophone Negritude movement. \"I was sent by the government of Biafra because I was also a writer, in the hope of stopping the war,\" Achebe recalls. \"We talked about Biafra for 10 minutes and literature for two hours.\" But as war broke out, Achebe served on more diplomatic missions for the breakaway Biafran republic. \"I was deeply disappointed with what was happening in Nigeria,\" he says. \"I was ready just to go to my village, but I did whatever I was asked.\" </p> <p>The war was shattering for Achebe; his house was bombed and his best friend, the poet Christopher Okigbo, was killed. On the \"wrong side\" when the secessionists were crushed, Achebe was refused a passport, but finally left in 1972, for professorships in the US before returning to Nsukka as professor of English in 1976. He had first visited the US in the early 60s, when he met writers including Ralph Ellison and Langston Hughes. His unsentimental recovery of the dignity of Africa's past chimed with the notion of \"black is beautiful\" among African-Americans brought up to see Africa as an embarrassment. John Edgar Wideman recalls the shock of finding \"language being refashioned from another centre I didn't know existed\". </p> <p>Achebe embraced writers of the diaspora, calling Africa a \"spiritual phenomenon born of a painful history... which binds every Black person\". He launched the journal Okike, and later a bilingual Igbo journal. Beware Soul Brother (1971), which won the Commonwealth poetry prize, and Girls At War And Other Stories (1972), both reflected the trauma of the civil war. He also published children's books, essays and a heartfelt polemic, The Trouble With Nigeria (1983), when he became involved in party politics. But there was a gap of 21 years before his fifth novel. </p> <p>Lyn Innes, professor of postcolonial literatures at the University of Kent, co-edited two Heinemann African anthologies with Achebe. In her view, \"his fiction was concerned with portraying a society, and Nigerian society was so totally destabilised, he found it difficult to write a sustained work - only fragments\". Achebe says: \"I don't think it damaged my work; it gave it a new direction for a while into poetry and short stories. I regard all of them equally.\" </p> <p>Achebe's friend James Baldwin savoured the elegance of Achebe's essays as \"not a mere pleasure but a benefaction\". The dissection in the essays of Europe's self-serving myths of Africa, and how they shored up slavery and empire, are a prelude to Edward Said's Orientalism (1978) and Toni Morrison's scrutiny of the black presence in American literature in Playing In The Dark (1992). In a famous lecture on Heart Of Darkness in Massachusetts in 1975 (included in Hopes and Impediments, 1988) he described Joseph Conrad as a \"thoroughgoing racist\", disputing that a novel which dehumanises a portion of the human race could be called a great work of art (one American professor stalked off, saying, \"How dare you?\"). </p> <p> Achebe attacked the \"perverse arrogance\" of reducing Africa to a \"setting and backdrop which eliminates the African as human factor\". In his view: \"Conrad saw and condemned the evil of imperial exploitation but was strangely unaware of the racism on which it sharpened its tooth.\" </p> <p>\"I'm surprised it's gone on being controversial, but it has,\" he says. Some still argue that to accuse Conrad of racism is anachronistic. Achebe responds: \"Long before Conrad, there were people who refused to be racist. Time does contribute something to what we think, but good people are never prisoners of their era.\" As for Conrad's prose: \"It would have been better if the beautiful prose were used to unite the human race, rather than separate it. The best works, whether written or oral, seem to me to have an intrinsic morality; it's not Sunday school morality, but I've not encountered any good art that promotes genocide.\" </p> <p>Achebe's stand is sometimes misunderstood as censorship. \"I'm not Ayatollah Khomeini,\" he objects. \"I don't believe in banning books, but they should be read carefully. Far from wanting the novel banned, I teach it.\" By the same token, he advocates closer reading of VS Naipaul (\"a new Conrad... purveyor of the old comforting myths of race\") and Elspeth Huxley (\"the griot [story-telling caste] for white settlers\"). </p> <p>In his introduction, with poems, to Another Africa (1998, Lund Humphries), photographs by Robert Lyons, Achebe writes: \"The vast arsenal of derogatory images of Africa amassed to defend the slave trade and, later, colonisation, gave the world not only a literary tradition that is now, happily defunct, but also a particular way of looking (or rather not looking) at Africa and Africans.\" He warns against the enduring tendency to act for, or upon, Africa while failing to listen to its inhabitants. </p> <p>In a 1998 lecture to the World Bank, he urged the cancellation of Third World debt, having told western bankers in Paris a decade before: \"You talk about 'structural adjustment' as if Africa was some kind of laboratory... But Africa is people!\" Achebe has called himself a \"missionary in reverse\". Lyn Innes, who sat in on his classes in the US in the 1970s, says, \"ill-informed students would ask outrageous questions about cannibalism, or from reading his work as anthropology not literature. But he was always patient and tolerant, trying to turn them around.\" </p> <p>Achebe's fifth novel, Anthills Of The Savannah (1987), revived his reputation in Britain when it was shortlisted for the Booker. Set in a military regime in present-day west Africa, it introduced a female intellectual, the journalist Beatrice, some say in response to criticism of his earlier work. \"Feminists would like to take credit; I've no objection, but I don't need anyone to scare me into realising the paradoxical position of women,\" says Achebe, who is working on a new novel with women at its heart. </p> <p>\"The female presence is there in all my novels. It seems as if it's not important - which is the reality of how it looks in Igbo society - till you get to a crisis which threatens survival. When the British came, that was a critical moment; the men fought and lost. But there were events in Igboland where women stopped the British in their tracks. That's been happening in my fiction; the incremental involvement of women in political matters. It's not straightforward; it's a struggle for power.\" </p> <p>Morrison believes Achebe's early work leaves a lot of space for women, which was like a revelation to her: \"the notion here in America is that slavery was about the imprisonment and emasculation of black men. But with Achebe I never felt the male claw grabbing up the entire canvas; there was feminine space where women existed without permission from the man.\" </p> <p>Others could step into that space. Farah, whose novel From A Crooked Rib (1970) was written from the point of view of a circumcised Somali woman, points out that the central consciousness, even of Anthills Of The Savannah, is still male, but says his own writing was partly in response to the absences he felt in Achebe's oeuvre. He says it was important for someone to deal with the bigger quarrels of Africa and colonialism - \"but it left me free to cover quarrels within the community - between men and women\". </p> <p>Last year Achebe visited Nigeria for the first time since his accident. His initial impressions of Lagos were \"confusing and very depressing; the place looked deserted, not well looked after, with potholes in the landing strip\". Only after a bitter quarrel was a wheelchair found to take him off the plane. \"I went incognito; I didn't want a red carpet. That's normally my style because I want to see the country as it is.\" Pained, he murmurs the unthinkable: \"Maybe somebody wanted me to bribe them.\" </p> <p>In The Trouble With Nigeria, Achebe insisted: \"Nigerians are what they are only because their leaders are not what they should be.\" He swiped at Gen Obasanjo for his \"flamboyant, imaginary\" idea of a great Nigeria. On his recent trip, however, Achebe met the general, now civilian president, \"to encourage him\". Although Nigeria is \"sicker than we feared\" (he identifies the Muslim sharia law as the greatest threat to the federation), Achebe clings to hope: \"Even Nigerians are not entirely immune from learning from their history.\" </p> <p>He had to steel himself for the 400-mile car journey to Ogidi: \"you might suddenly find a ditch in the middle of the road. Life is so unsafe,\" he says. \"Things had got much worse in nine years; for the first time you saw beggars camped out by the roadside. But I always return to the good things: the whole village had turned out and waited all day.\" His arrival was hailed with an artillery salute. \"It was a tremendous experience. I almost found myself in tears; there are good things going on. My people deserve better than they've had by a long chalk.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Chinua Achebe's novels are published by Heinemann International.

The ideas I wanted to pursue took an autobiographical turn because the final authority I could bring was that of my own experience.\" He was born in 1930 in Ogidi, an Igbo village near the Niger, 400 miles east of Lagos. The fifth of six children, he was baptised Albert Chinualumogu, but \"dropped the tribute to Victorian England\". His father, Isaiah, was a Christian convert and evangelist, with \"gallows humour\". He and Achebe's mother, Janet, were \"ardent followers, but not fanatical\"; while the family sang hymns, Isaiah's relatives offered food to what he considered idols. \"An accommodation with the church developed after initial struggle,\" says Achebe. \"Common sense and the strength of Igbo culture slowly reasserted themselves.\" His parents were \"extremely profound people, of few words but strong convictions; great believers in education\"; with little resources, they sent their children to school. Chike Momah, a classmate, recalls Albert Achebe as a brilliant conversationalist - a trait shared with his father - and says his headmaster predicted \"he would make the rain that would drench us all\". \"We lived at the crossroads of cultures\", wrote Achebe, who learned English at eight and whose passport declared him a British Protected Person (\"an arrogant lie because I never did ask anyone to protect me\"). He contrasts the slow, quiet education of his home village with the louder, formal education of mission school. \"I knew I wanted to understand the life of the society, the stories and masquerades,\" he says. \"It's curious how brainwashed we were; quite a bit of my growing up was discovering that fact.\" In a 1973 essay, Named For Victoria, Queen Of England, he describes Things Fall Apart as \"an act of atonement with my past, the ritual return and homage of a prodigal son\". He says: \"It's that fascination with the scraps and pieces of information I could gather about my ancestors that developed into a desire to write my story. Colonial education was saying there was nothing worth much in my society, and I was beginning to question that, to see there were things that were beautiful even in the 'heathen'.\" Enrolled at Ibadan university to study medicine (\"a false step\"), Achebe switched to the arts. In the new essay \"Home Under Imperial Fire\", he describes how he was spurred to write partly by being made to read Joyce Cary's 1939 novel Mister Johnson, with its \"bumbling idiot\" of a Nigerian character: \"It began to dawn on me that although fiction was undoubtedly fictitious, it could also be true or false.\" He explains: \"I'd read so-called 'African novels' in school, by Rider Haggard and John Buchan, in which white people were surrounded by savages but managed to come out on top. But I didn't recognise them as relating to me until I read Mister Johnson: this book was not talking about a vague place called Africa but about southern Nigeria. I said, 'wait, that means here; this is our story'. It brought the whole thing home to me: this story is not true, so is it possible the others are not either? It opened up a new way of looking at literature.\" That \"landmark rebellion\" caught a wider moment. \"The 50s were also the time when the ferment for freedom was at its highest. India was independent, so it was only a matter of time for west Africa. The second world war was fought for freedom; when they told us to collect pine kernels for the war effort, they said each one would put a nail in Hitler's coffin. Nigerians returning home from the war asked, 'where's the freedom we were told about?' So the two things were together: the political ferment and the revolution in the classroom.\" Achebe credits Amos Tutuola's The Palm-Wine Drinkard (1952) with opening \"the floodgates to modern west African writing\" in the 50s. \"It's as if this thing was waiting to be told; the time was ripe,\" he says. The precolonial society of Things Fall Apart, whose tragic hero Okonkwo mounts doomed resistance to encroaching European power, was far from idyllic. Achebe insists on \"an unflinching consciousness of the flaws that blemished our inheritance\". He says: \"Of all the things I remember, that was the clearest: I must not make this story look nicer than it was. I went out of my way to gather all the negative things, to describe them as I think they were - good and bad - and ordinary human beings as neither demons nor angels. I dare anybody to say, 'these people are not human'.\" He wrote in English, as arguments against using the language of the coloniser were gathering steam. \"It was part of the logic of my situation - like the inevitability of my writing at all - of countering stories about us in the same language in which they were written. Writing in English is a painful choice. But you don't take up a language in order to punish it; that language becomes part of you. And you can't use language at a distance; you introduce English and Igbo into a conversation, as they are in my daily life - that's fascinating.\" The Igbo art of storytelling became central to the tale, since \"proverbs are the palm oil with which words are eaten\". Achebe, who writes poetry in both Igbo and English, says, \"I insist on both\". For the critic Simon Gikandi, Achebe showed that \"the future of African writing did not lie in sim ple imitation of European forms but in the fusion of such forms with oral traditions\". Kwame Anthony Appiah, professor of Afro-American studies and philosophy at Harvard, says Achebe \"solved with deceptive ease difficult technical questions, such as how you represent the language of one society in the language of a very different one. His use of a variety of registers of English came to be seen as obvious; it set modern African literature in English on a certain path.\" The Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o, who in the 80s renounced writing fiction in English in favour of Gikuyu, believes \"Achebe created a third position out of the tension between Igbo and English, which becomes the base of his creativity; you feel there's an African voice in his work being rendered in English.\" After working as a radio producer, Achebe had come to London in 1957 to train at the BBC staff school. \"It was the first time I saw the great British empire at close quarters, and it brought England a couple of pegs down: to find a white man in dirty overalls filling holes in the road was unbelievable.\" He sent the longhand manuscript of Things Fall Apart to William Heinemann, where a reader pronounced it \"the best first novel since the war\". But at a time when many in the metropolis believed, according to the publisher James Currey, that \"an African could not reach the standards of an English publishing house\", a modest 2,000 hardbacks were printed. Then in 1962 Heinemann Educational Books launched the African Writers Series with four novels, including Things Fall Apart and its sequel, No Longer At Ease - set on the cusp of independence, in the era of Okonkwo's grandson. It was an inexpensive paperback imprint that emulated the Penguin revolution down to its orange covers, while selling 80% of copies in Africa and keeping titles in print. It proved that a readership existed, and was a signal for Africa's writers, says Achebe, who selected the first 100 titles. He was able to do what was an unpaid job as series editor for 10 years because he had jobs in broadcasting, and then academia. (The late Heinemann director Alan Hill recalled him as \"the very image of a modern Nigerian yuppie\", with sharp suit, dark glasses and a Jaguar.) \"I thought it was of the utmost importance,\" Achebe explains. \"People in England were sceptical, so I knew I was a conspirator. I was naive enough to think that if you do good work, you'll get your reward in heaven.\" For Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Achebe \"made a whole generation of African people believe in themselves and in the possibility of their being writers\". The Somali novelist Nuruddin Farah says he learned his craft from him: \"He taught us a way of integrating what we know from being African with what we've become - hybrids of a kind.\" After travelling through southern Africa on a Rockefeller scholarship in 1960, \"the winds of change in my sails\", (vexing the Northern Rhodesian authorities by sitting in the front of a segregated bus near Victoria Falls), Achebe became the first director of Voice of Nigeria, the state-run radio's external arm, where he remained till the eve of the Biafran war in 1966. He met his wife to be, Christie Chinwe, then a student, in Broadcasting House in Lagos, where she had a holiday job. She later became a professor. The couple have two sons and two daughters (one of whom, Chinelo, is a writer), and two grandchildren. \"Christie saves my life every other day,\" says Achebe. \"And she suffers my pain more than I do. When I had the accident, she left her classroom and never really got back.\" Though she is now a psychology professor at Bard, she was forced to leave her field of education, a sacrifice Achebe feels keenly. \"When I was drifting in and out of consciousness I remember saying I wanted her to go with me - to England. That's been her life ever since.\" After his third novel, Arrow of God (1964), set in Igboland in the 1920s - which won the Jock Campbell New Statesman award - Achebe wrote a satire on corruption in a fictitious African country following the \"collusive swindle that was independence\". A Man Of The People (1966) proved prescient about Nigeria's first attempted coup, which happened two days before its publication. Some thought the author complicit in the Igbo-instigated coup. He obviously wasn't. As massacres spread against Igbos in northern and western Nigeria, Achebe and his family went into hiding. They fled Lagos for Igboland, where Achebe took up a post at the university in Nsukka. On the eve of the Biafran war of 1967-70, Achebe went on a peace-seeking mission to President Leopold Senghor of Senegal, founder-poet of the francophone Negritude movement. \"I was sent by the government of Biafra because I was also a writer, in the hope of stopping the war,\" Achebe recalls. \"We talked about Biafra for 10 minutes and literature for two hours.\" But as war broke out, Achebe served on more diplomatic missions for the breakaway Biafran republic. \"I was deeply disappointed with what was happening in Nigeria,\" he says. \"I was ready just to go to my village, but I did whatever I was asked.\" The war was shattering for Achebe; his house was bombed and his best friend, the poet Christopher Okigbo, was killed. On the \"wrong side\" when the secessionists were crushed, Achebe was refused a passport, but finally left in 1972, for professorships in the US before returning to Nsukka as professor of English in 1976. He had first visited the US in the early 60s, when he met writers including Ralph Ellison and Langston Hughes. His unsentimental recovery of the dignity of Africa's past chimed with the notion of \"black is beautiful\" among African-Americans brought up to see Africa as an embarrassment. John Edgar Wideman recalls the shock of finding \"language being refashioned from another centre I didn't know existed\". Achebe embraced writers of the diaspora, calling Africa a \"spiritual phenomenon born of a painful history... which binds every Black person\". He launched the journal Okike, and later a bilingual Igbo journal. Beware Soul Brother (1971), which won the Commonwealth poetry prize, and Girls At War And Other Stories (1972), both reflected the trauma of the civil war. He also published children's books, essays and a heartfelt polemic, The Trouble With Nigeria (1983), when he became involved in party politics. But there was a gap of 21 years before his fifth novel. Lyn Innes, professor of postcolonial literatures at the University of Kent, co-edited two Heinemann African anthologies with Achebe. In her view, \"his fiction was concerned with portraying a society, and Nigerian society was so totally destabilised, he found it difficult to write a sustained work - only fragments\". Achebe says: \"I don't think it damaged my work; it gave it a new direction for a while into poetry and short stories. I regard all of them equally.\" Achebe's friend James Baldwin savoured the elegance of Achebe's essays as \"not a mere pleasure but a benefaction\". The dissection in the essays of Europe's self-serving myths of Africa, and how they shored up slavery and empire, are a prelude to Edward Said's Orientalism (1978) and Toni Morrison's scrutiny of the black presence in American literature in Playing In The Dark (1992). In a famous lecture on Heart Of Darkness in Massachusetts in 1975 (included in Hopes and Impediments, 1988) he described Joseph Conrad as a \"thoroughgoing racist\", disputing that a novel which dehumanises a portion of the human race could be called a great work of art (one American professor stalked off, saying, \"How dare you?\"). Achebe attacked the \"perverse arrogance\" of reducing Africa to a \"setting and backdrop which eliminates the African as human factor\". In his view: \"Conrad saw and condemned the evil of imperial exploitation but was strangely unaware of the racism on which it sharpened its tooth.\" \"I'm surprised it's gone on being controversial, but it has,\" he says. Some still argue that to accuse Conrad of racism is anachronistic. Achebe responds: \"Long before Conrad, there were people who refused to be racist. Time does contribute something to what we think, but good people are never prisoners of their era.\" As for Conrad's prose: \"It would have been better if the beautiful prose were used to unite the human race, rather than separate it. The best works, whether written or oral, seem to me to have an intrinsic morality; it's not Sunday school morality, but I've not encountered any good art that promotes genocide.\" Achebe's stand is sometimes misunderstood as censorship. \"I'm not Ayatollah Khomeini,\" he objects. \"I don't believe in banning books, but they should be read carefully. Far from wanting the novel banned, I teach it.\" By the same token, he advocates closer reading of VS Naipaul (\"a new Conrad... purveyor of the old comforting myths of race\") and Elspeth Huxley (\"the griot [story-telling caste] for white settlers\"). In his introduction, with poems, to Another Africa (1998, Lund Humphries), photographs by Robert Lyons, Achebe writes: \"The vast arsenal of derogatory images of Africa amassed to defend the slave trade and, later, colonisation, gave the world not only a literary tradition that is now, happily defunct, but also a particular way of looking (or rather not looking) at Africa and Africans.\" He warns against the enduring tendency to act for, or upon, Africa while failing to listen to its inhabitants. In a 1998 lecture to the World Bank, he urged the cancellation of Third World debt, having told western bankers in Paris a decade before: \"You talk about 'structural adjustment' as if Africa was some kind of laboratory... But Africa is people!\" Achebe has called himself a \"missionary in reverse\". Lyn Innes, who sat in on his classes in the US in the 1970s, says, \"ill-informed students would ask outrageous questions about cannibalism, or from reading his work as anthropology not literature. But he was always patient and tolerant, trying to turn them around.\" Achebe's fifth novel, Anthills Of The Savannah (1987), revived his reputation in Britain when it was shortlisted for the Booker. Set in a military regime in present-day west Africa, it introduced a female intellectual, the journalist Beatrice, some say in response to criticism of his earlier work. \"Feminists would like to take credit; I've no objection, but I don't need anyone to scare me into realising the paradoxical position of women,\" says Achebe, who is working on a new novel with women at its heart. \"The female presence is there in all my novels. It seems as if it's not important - which is the reality of how it looks in Igbo society - till you get to a crisis which threatens survival. When the British came, that was a critical moment; the men fought and lost. But there were events in Igboland where women stopped the British in their tracks. That's been happening in my fiction; the incremental involvement of women in political matters. It's not straightforward; it's a struggle for power.\" Morrison believes Achebe's early work leaves a lot of space for women, which was like a revelation to her: \"the notion here in America is that slavery was about the imprisonment and emasculation of black men. But with Achebe I never felt the male claw grabbing up the entire canvas; there was feminine space where women existed without permission from the man.\" Others could step into that space. Farah, whose novel From A Crooked Rib (1970) was written from the point of view of a circumcised Somali woman, points out that the central consciousness, even of Anthills Of The Savannah, is still male, but says his own writing was partly in response to the absences he felt in Achebe's oeuvre. He says it was important for someone to deal with the bigger quarrels of Africa and colonialism - \"but it left me free to cover quarrels within the community - between men and women\". Last year Achebe visited Nigeria for the first time since his accident. His initial impressions of Lagos were \"confusing and very depressing; the place looked deserted, not well looked after, with potholes in the landing strip\". Only after a bitter quarrel was a wheelchair found to take him off the plane. \"I went incognito; I didn't want a red carpet. That's normally my style because I want to see the country as it is.\" Pained, he murmurs the unthinkable: \"Maybe somebody wanted me to bribe them.\" In The Trouble With Nigeria, Achebe insisted: \"Nigerians are what they are only because their leaders are not what they should be.\" He swiped at Gen Obasanjo for his \"flamboyant, imaginary\" idea of a great Nigeria. On his recent trip, however, Achebe met the general, now civilian president, \"to encourage him\". Although Nigeria is \"sicker than we feared\" (he identifies the Muslim sharia law as the greatest threat to the federation), Achebe clings to hope: \"Even Nigerians are not entirely immune from learning from their history.\" He had to steel himself for the 400-mile car journey to Ogidi: \"you might suddenly find a ditch in the middle of the road. Life is so unsafe,\" he says. \"Things had got much worse in nine years; for the first time you saw beggars camped out by the roadside. But I always return to the good things: the whole village had turned out and waited all day.\" His arrival was hailed with an artillery salute. \"It was a tremendous experience. I almost found myself in tears; there are good things going on. My people deserve better than they've had by a long chalk.\" \u0095 Chinua Achebe's novels are published by Heinemann International.

What would you suggest, Tanya?' I checked the net. There are manors and halls available across the country, but in http://www.places-to-marry.co.uk, I discovered that in London you can get married in the Painted Hall in Greenwich, The National Liberal Club, The Comedy Store, or the zoo. 'What do they suggest in Birmingham?' Mum said. 'Paul's from there.' 'You can get married at Aston Villa Football Club,' I suggested. 'Never! I'm a Man U fan until death do us part!' she retorted. 'Then try the BBC at Pebble Mill - they can perform marriages on the premises.' She wasn't that keen, so we checked Manchester: Manchester United FC is available, but apparently Paul would not approve. 'Football could force us apart. What if I change my mind?' Mum asked in anguish. I didn't know what to say, so I checked 'change of mind'. I found this dialogue on the subject at http:// www.forums.vmag.com/suvvehic0199/ messages/1642.html, where Lisa K and an unidentified correspondent discussed the frightful mess that followed the wedding in America last year of Darva Conger on Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire.

She had lived there until she was 18, when she left home for university. Though the house remained in the family, it was rented out to students for several years. Eventually, Liesel's mother began toying with the idea of selling the place when Liesel, who had recently started looking for a house for herself, offered to buy it. \"It would be hard to find a lovelier house, and so it just seemed the natural thing to do.\"</p> <p>Liesel has painstakingly transformed the place from a memory-sodden home with the William Morris wallpaper, deep-red carpets and 70s furniture of her childhood into somewhere that is indelibly stamped with her personality and taste. The colour scheme is bold, while large pieces of furniture are mixed with a collection of knick-knacks and trinkets, shoes and photos from around the world. It all goes to make the home feel striking and dynamic, rather than depressingly nostalgic.</p> <p>Liesel's obvious need to make her mark has sometimes brought disapproval from the rest of her family: \"Every time I do something new there are raised eyebrows, because if there was already a perfectly good bathroom it is difficult for them to see why on earth I would want a whole new one. I took the garden on in a way it had never been taken on before, conquering the 'jungle' that my brother and I used to take such delight hiding in, and making a beautiful, lush but fairly orderly garden. As for the new kitchen, it was considered grossly extravagant.\"</p> <p>It was not only Liesel's family who found it difficult that she had taken over the family home, but also friends who had known her since childhood. \"They seemed to find it a bit awkward at first, as if they couldn't quite relax because they thought my mum might walk in and ask what they were doing smoking in the sitting-room.\" The neighbours, too, seemed slightly confused to begin with, as very few of them had moved away since Liesel had originally lived there. \"At first, I could tell that they thought it odd that they now had to view me as a responsible homeowner, whereas only a few years earlier I had been the errant teenage daughter. In fact, it has made me feel even more secure having pretty much the same neighbours as I always did, even though the surrounding area has changed so much. It is so much more gentrified now.\"</p> <p>There was a natural and respectful pause of about six months or so before Liesel could bring herself to start redecorating, and she needed to have a couple of lodgers in order to finance any changes, anyway. Not surprisingly, one of the first things she decided was that her rather sumptuous and ladylike bedroom would be the one room that had been out of bounds to her and her brother as children. \"The house was always very lively because not only did we always have lodgers but it became a place where my brother and my friends would always congregate before they went out, and my mum must have needed a bolt-hole,\" she explains. \"I was being quite daring by truly staking my claim and making that room my bedroom.\"</p> <p>Liesel took in her own lodgers. One of them, Leo Burley, she found particularly irritating because he was messy and did not seem to have any respect for her home and what she was trying to do with it. One week, she was complaining to friends about him; the next, she found that they had fallen in love. \"It took us both completely by surprise. We thought we loathed each other and then discovered that the mutual feeling was actually something else.\"</p> <p>They married a year later and have lived in the house ever since. \"At first, Leo really wanted us both to move out and start again because it didn't feel it could really be ours. That is why the kitchen extension became so important, because it was a major work that we had decided upon together.\"</p> <p>The extension is impressively modern, contrasting with the elegant and rather traditional living room - with its Patrice Butler chandelier and chaise longue - which it leads on to. Though they had to lose some of the garden to build it, they were able to to create a large dining area as well. As always with such projects, building the kitchen was a nightmare, reminding me of an architect friend who once said that the most emotionally fraught of all architecture is the extension and that it is \"often a compensation for not moving, spreading your wings just a little bit\".</p> <p>Elsewhere in the house, Leo's personality is there, too, moving it away even more from its past into its new identity. Now, there is little left to connect it with its former life - except, that is, for the stair carpet. \"I found myself unable to deviate from having a red stair carpet, just like my mum had chosen,\" says Liesel. \"So that is my tribute to the house as it was.\"</p>",

She had lived there until she was 18, when she left home for university. Though the house remained in the family, it was rented out to students for several years. Eventually, Liesel's mother began toying with the idea of selling the place when Liesel, who had recently started looking for a house for herself, offered to buy it. \"It would be hard to find a lovelier house, and so it just seemed the natural thing to do.\" Liesel has painstakingly transformed the place from a memory-sodden home with the William Morris wallpaper, deep-red carpets and 70s furniture of her childhood into somewhere that is indelibly stamped with her personality and taste. The colour scheme is bold, while large pieces of furniture are mixed with a collection of knick-knacks and trinkets, shoes and photos from around the world. It all goes to make the home feel striking and dynamic, rather than depressingly nostalgic. Liesel's obvious need to make her mark has sometimes brought disapproval from the rest of her family: \"Every time I do something new there are raised eyebrows, because if there was already a perfectly good bathroom it is difficult for them to see why on earth I would want a whole new one. I took the garden on in a way it had never been taken on before, conquering the 'jungle' that my brother and I used to take such delight hiding in, and making a beautiful, lush but fairly orderly garden. As for the new kitchen, it was considered grossly extravagant.\" It was not only Liesel's family who found it difficult that she had taken over the family home, but also friends who had known her since childhood. \"They seemed to find it a bit awkward at first, as if they couldn't quite relax because they thought my mum might walk in and ask what they were doing smoking in the sitting-room.\" The neighbours, too, seemed slightly confused to begin with, as very few of them had moved away since Liesel had originally lived there. \"At first, I could tell that they thought it odd that they now had to view me as a responsible homeowner, whereas only a few years earlier I had been the errant teenage daughter. In fact, it has made me feel even more secure having pretty much the same neighbours as I always did, even though the surrounding area has changed so much. It is so much more gentrified now.\" There was a natural and respectful pause of about six months or so before Liesel could bring herself to start redecorating, and she needed to have a couple of lodgers in order to finance any changes, anyway. Not surprisingly, one of the first things she decided was that her rather sumptuous and ladylike bedroom would be the one room that had been out of bounds to her and her brother as children. \"The house was always very lively because not only did we always have lodgers but it became a place where my brother and my friends would always congregate before they went out, and my mum must have needed a bolt-hole,\" she explains. \"I was being quite daring by truly staking my claim and making that room my bedroom.\" Liesel took in her own lodgers. One of them, Leo Burley, she found particularly irritating because he was messy and did not seem to have any respect for her home and what she was trying to do with it. One week, she was complaining to friends about him; the next, she found that they had fallen in love. \"It took us both completely by surprise. We thought we loathed each other and then discovered that the mutual feeling was actually something else.\" They married a year later and have lived in the house ever since. \"At first, Leo really wanted us both to move out and start again because it didn't feel it could really be ours. That is why the kitchen extension became so important, because it was a major work that we had decided upon together.\" The extension is impressively modern, contrasting with the elegant and rather traditional living room - with its Patrice Butler chandelier and chaise longue - which it leads on to. Though they had to lose some of the garden to build it, they were able to to create a large dining area as well. As always with such projects, building the kitchen was a nightmare, reminding me of an architect friend who once said that the most emotionally fraught of all architecture is the extension and that it is \"often a compensation for not moving, spreading your wings just a little bit\". Elsewhere in the house, Leo's personality is there, too, moving it away even more from its past into its new identity. Now, there is little left to connect it with its former life - except, that is, for the stair carpet. \"I found myself unable to deviate from having a red stair carpet, just like my mum had chosen,\" says Liesel. \"So that is my tribute to the house as it was.\"",

It's a stunning bargain of delicacy and fruity stealth. <strong>Casas del Bosque Chardonnay 1999</strong>(16.5 points, \u00a35.49), from Chile, has touches of yoghurt to the ripe melon and lemon, but these are not overdone and so the extreme reached is poised between charming concentration and fresh fruitiness. <strong>Villa Maria Private Bin Chardonnay 1998</strong> (17.5 points, \u00a36.97), from New Zealand, has gentility of woodiness allied to delightful fruit with beautifully balanced acids.

But it is catching on among adults - neatly sidesteping the horror of traipsing through shopping malls during the pre-Christmas rush. </p> <p>In the US and Australia, it has become common for charities to supply Christmas gift cards showing that \"A gift has been made in your name towards ... maintaining a school/providing medicine/digging a well, etc\" and the concept is now beginning to appear in Britain. </p> <p>Trocaire, a sister charity to Cafod in Ireland, this week launched its Global Gift Campaign, where it gives individual donors Christmas cards with a gift certificate enclosed, detailing where the money has been spent, to post on to friends and relatives. </p> <p>Help The Aged is also encouraging people to join its Adopt a Granny scheme, costing from \u00a315 per month. </p> <p>The Inland Revenue can help too. The government's Gift Aid scheme is financially the most effective way to donate cash at Christmas. Any charity receiving a donation from a UK taxpayer can reclaim basic rate tax, currently 22% on the gift. In cash terms, that means that a \u00a350 donation is actually worth \u00a364.10 once the charity has reclaimed the tax, at no extra cost to the donor. Higher rate taxpayers can reclaim the difference between higher and basic rate tax, currently 18% for themselves. </p> <p>Gift Aid is remarkably simple; donors don't have to sign a form to make the donation - all they have to do is tell the charity their name and address and confirm they are a UK taxpayer. </p> <p>Another easy way to give at Christmas is to open a CharityCard Account. Card holders can nominate any charity for their donation, and the organisers, the Charities Aid Foundation will arrange for the charity to receive the basic rate tax. </p> <p>Oxfam has 840 shops selling a wide range of Christmas gifts sourced from Fair Trade, which promotes goods made in the Third World.

All the major supermarkets are stocking organic versions of all the usual food, but for many people buying from the big chains defeats a part of the object of organic - getting as close to the source of food as possible. </p> <p>A spokesman from the Soil Association, the body which grants organic certification in this country, says: \"Buying from farmers' markets, farm shops and box schemes means that you are supporting the local producers in your area. It is a great way to give financial support at the same time as getting to know more about where your food is coming from.\" </p> <p>The first farmers' market was set up in Bath in 1997 and the concept has grown fast: there are now more than 200 throughout the UK. Producers come from a 20-30 mile radius to sell their (mostly) organic foods - the official definition for the markets is a place selling food \"reared, caught, brewed, pickled, baked, smoked or processed by the stallholder\" - and are charged just a small stall fee. </p> <p>Most of the country is now covered by a fruit or vegetable box delivery scheme. Some are nationwide, although this again removes the buying locally element, and they tend to be cheaper than supermarkets for organic produce as overheads are lower. The Soil Association has voted Organic Connections International of Wisbech near Cambridge as top box retailer this year. Organic Connections charges \u00a313.50 per box, which will contain core fruit and vegetables for a Christmas lunch as well as seasonal variants and some produce from co-operatives in France, Italy and Spain. It also sells organic pet food. </p> <p>Also on the Soil Association website is a list of organic retailers specialising in Christmas food, from turkeys to more esoteric fare such as Boxing Day game and port pies. Providence Farm in north Devon will send its meat, lamb, beef, chicken, duck and guinea fowl anywhere in the UK. A 10kg beefbox is \u00a379.50 or a 12kg mixed poultry box costs \u00a375 plus postage and packing. Pimhill Farm in Shrewsbury sells mostly from its farmshop, but will send goods by mail order. Produce includes organic turkeys at \u00a38.35 a kilo, Christmas pudding, iced Christmas cake made by the farm's chef, mince pies and chocolate truffle roulade soaked in organic brandy. </p> <p>Sedlescombe Vinyard in Sussex sells a dry and medium organic white wine for \u00a37.75 and a dryish sparkling white for \u00a314.95.

Two Christmas chart-topping CDs will set you back \u00a330, but could instead provide a medical kit to care for the healthcare needs of a Vietnamese village. The idea of skipping Christmas presents and giving the money to worthy charitable causes instead will hardly appeal to children. But it is catching on among adults - neatly sidesteping the horror of traipsing through shopping malls during the pre-Christmas rush. In the US and Australia, it has become common for charities to supply Christmas gift cards showing that \"A gift has been made in your name towards ... maintaining a school/providing medicine/digging a well, etc\" and the concept is now beginning to appear in Britain. Trocaire, a sister charity to Cafod in Ireland, this week launched its Global Gift Campaign, where it gives individual donors Christmas cards with a gift certificate enclosed, detailing where the money has been spent, to post on to friends and relatives. Help The Aged is also encouraging people to join its Adopt a Granny scheme, costing from \u00a315 per month. The Inland Revenue can help too. The government's Gift Aid scheme is financially the most effective way to donate cash at Christmas. Any charity receiving a donation from a UK taxpayer can reclaim basic rate tax, currently 22% on the gift. In cash terms, that means that a \u00a350 donation is actually worth \u00a364.10 once the charity has reclaimed the tax, at no extra cost to the donor. Higher rate taxpayers can reclaim the difference between higher and basic rate tax, currently 18% for themselves. Gift Aid is remarkably simple; donors don't have to sign a form to make the donation - all they have to do is tell the charity their name and address and confirm they are a UK taxpayer. Another easy way to give at Christmas is to open a CharityCard Account. Card holders can nominate any charity for their donation, and the organisers, the Charities Aid Foundation will arrange for the charity to receive the basic rate tax. Oxfam has 840 shops selling a wide range of Christmas gifts sourced from Fair Trade, which promotes goods made in the Third World. Its top seller is Christmas Crackers at \u00a39.99 for six \"family\" crackers or \u00a312.99 for the luxury version. Each contains a Fair Trade gift.

Fair Trade's on-line shop is at http://store1.europe.yahoo.com/oxfam-uk Animal attraction There are no shortage of environmentally friendly, socially responsible and energy efficient gift options. The Natural Collection boasts one of the more eclectic selections of eco-friendly gifts. The Bath-based company, a trading partner of Friends of the Earth, is offering unisex T-shirts made from 100% organic cotton (\u00a310), handcrafted forest vine table mats from the Philippines (from \u00a39.95), and plant-based candles derived from natural sources including coconut oil and scented with pure aromatherapy oils (from \u00a33.50). Or what about giving a growing tree? From \u00a318 including postage and packing, Shropshire-based Trees Direct will send a friend or relative a carefully-packed tree complete with planting instructions. There are more than 30 trees on offer from English oak, walnut and silver birch to eucalyptus, olive and monkey puzzle. If you would rather support up-and-coming young businesses than hand your cash to the high street giants, try a new website set up to promote the wares of some of the UK's newest designers who were helped on their way by The Prince's Trust. Gifts on sale at its website and at the shop in the King's Road, London, include funky handbags, briefcases and rucksacks made from recycled rubber by Inner Tube (prices start from \u00a335); contemporary and colourful freeblown decanters and other glassware by Loco Glass (from \u00a325). Animal lovers can help to save endangered species and fund vital research by adopting an animal. Typically with the zoo schemes the adoption lasts a year and the recipient gets a photo, certificate, complimentary tickets and their name up on one of the \"thank you\" boards. At London Zoo you can adopt everything from a piranha (\u00a325) to a pygmy hippo (\u00a33,000). A \"share\" of an animal costs \u00a335. At Whipsnade you pay one price - \u00a340 - whatever animal you choose, from alpaca to zebra, while at tropical bird haven Paradise Park in Hayle, Cornwall, home of the World Parrot Trust macaws and flamingoes are just two of the species you can take under your wing (cost: \u00a330-\u00a3100). If you'd prefer to sponsor a creature living in the wild, you can adopt a Moray Firth dolphin or a Canadian whale via the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society which offers four categories of adoption ranging from junior (\u00a315.95) to adult friend (\u00a324.50). There are seven dolphins and five orcas (killer whales) to choose from, each of which is profiled on the website.

The gift of time If the thought of impersonating Jim Royle this Christmas appals you, slumped in your seat watching usual recipe of blockbuster films and TV specials, there is another option. It has never been easier for busy workers to volunteer their time over the festive period to support the less well off.

      "body": "<p>Benicio Del Toro's mumbling hood, Fenster, was killed off early in The Usual Suspects, but the actor made enough of an impression for critics to complain about his lack of screen time. To show there are no hard feelings, Del Toro has reteamed with Suspects writer Christopher McQuarrie for his directorial debut, The Way Of The Gun. It marks part of a return to form for Del Toro, who has hardly been seen since Terry Gilliam's Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. He's also coming up in Ken Loach's Bread And Roses, and Steven Soderbergh's eagerly awaited Traffic.</p> <p><strong>So, how did you and Chris get together on this?</strong></p> <p>We were in some coffee shop, talking about the pros and cons of doing films for the big studios, and at some point we said, \"Hey, why don't we do our own little movie?\" I've always thought Chris was a natural-born director. </p> <p><strong>But wasn't he considering leaving the movie business because he was unable to get a movie made? </strong></p> <p>Yeah, he was having one of those days where you feel like you're completely disconnected from the world. He definitely wanted to make a comment about where he stands with The Way Of The Gun. There is a lot of stuff in it about how he feels about people in Hollywood and the big studios. Like there's a scene where my character is sitting down with Jimmy Caan, and they talk about how criminals today are all for the posture. That's like saying film-makers, studios, and movies today are all about the package and not about substance. </p> <p><strong>Is that how you also feel? Until your cameo in Snatch, we hadn't seen you for a while. </strong></p> <p>After Fear And Loathing I got turned down a couple of times because people said I was a drunk. I even heard from a friend of mine that people thought I was in rehab. They looked at the performance and thought, \"The guy's gone crazy. Look how fat he got, and how fucked up he is in the movie.\" I think that influenced people in the industry to make certain decisions. </p> <p><strong>The Way Of The Gun is one of several crime films you've done.

      "bodyText": "Benicio Del Toro's mumbling hood, Fenster, was killed off early in The Usual Suspects, but the actor made enough of an impression for critics to complain about his lack of screen time. To show there are no hard feelings, Del Toro has reteamed with Suspects writer Christopher McQuarrie for his directorial debut, The Way Of The Gun. It marks part of a return to form for Del Toro, who has hardly been seen since Terry Gilliam's Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. He's also coming up in Ken Loach's Bread And Roses, and Steven Soderbergh's eagerly awaited Traffic. So, how did you and Chris get together on this? We were in some coffee shop, talking about the pros and cons of doing films for the big studios, and at some point we said, \"Hey, why don't we do our own little movie?\" I've always thought Chris was a natural-born director. But wasn't he considering leaving the movie business because he was unable to get a movie made? Yeah, he was having one of those days where you feel like you're completely disconnected from the world. He definitely wanted to make a comment about where he stands with The Way Of The Gun. There is a lot of stuff in it about how he feels about people in Hollywood and the big studios. Like there's a scene where my character is sitting down with Jimmy Caan, and they talk about how criminals today are all for the posture. That's like saying film-makers, studios, and movies today are all about the package and not about substance. Is that how you also feel? Until your cameo in Snatch, we hadn't seen you for a while. After Fear And Loathing I got turned down a couple of times because people said I was a drunk. I even heard from a friend of mine that people thought I was in rehab. They looked at the performance and thought, \"The guy's gone crazy. Look how fat he got, and how fucked up he is in the movie.\" I think that influenced people in the industry to make certain decisions. The Way Of The Gun is one of several crime films you've done. What attracts you to the genre? I'm not necessarily attracted to crime films, I think it's just the way the cookie crumbles. Hunter [S Thompson] said I have a guilty face. One thing I was interested in doing with The Way Of The Gun, though, was making a crime film where nothing's glamourised. It would be painful and more realistic. Kinda old school. Despite the violence, the film appears to be offering an anti-gun message. I think it does. The way we handle guns in the film, we wanted to treat them serious. I went to school in weapons for that film, and I think anyone who's going to own a gun should do the same. Then you decide whether you want to get one or not. The message of the film seems to have been missed by a lot of American critics. Yeah, completely. All they saw was a violent movie, and they didn't like it. But I think it's a smart film, too, for a more mature audience. In America it was marketed like it was for early-20s/teenagers but it's kind of like a film for an older generation.

First, Elizabeth Hurley ran through the usual gamut of male fantasies - policewoman, nurse, cheerleader, schoolgirl, Satan - in Bedazzled. Now Cameron Diaz turns up as a belly dancer, Lucy Liu does a brief turn as a charismatic dominatrix, Drew Barrymore lights up the screen as a car mechanic literally bursting out of her overalls, and all three femmes fatales surface as members of an unlikely hot-pants-clad Alpine oompah band in Charlie's Angels.</p> <p>For the past few years, Hollywood has repeatedly tried to repackage popular old television programmes into profitable movies, and the results have generally been disastrous. The Wild, Wild West, The Flintstones, Inspector Gadget, Dragnet and The Mod Squad were all unwatchable, and The Avengers was even worse. To date, only the Mission: Impossible franchise has passed muster in this genre. To its ranks can now be added Charlie's Angels, an often cartoonish but none the less entertaining film.</p> <p>To its credit, Charlie's Angels is not merely a campy send-up of the brain-dead 70s cop show starring Farrah Fawcett's hair, Jaclyn Smith's breasts, Cheryl Ladd's rear, Kate Jackson's winning smile, Shelly Hack's legs and Tonya Roberts. Instead, it is an equal mixture of campy send-up and good-natured action flick. In the end, it comes across as an all-girl Jackie Chan movie. With fewer stunts but a lot more T&amp;A.</p> <p>It must be pointed out that although Charlie's Angels was a beloved TV programme, it wasn't actually any good. The plots were idiotic: any excuse to get the girls into swimsuits. None of the actresses on the show ever transferred their success to the big screen; this may be because they were not very good actresses, though that certainly never hurt Demi Moore's career. </p> <p>By contrast, Charlie's Angels, the movie, can draw on the estimable resources of Cameron Diaz, the most appealing young actress working today. A natural clown with unconventional good looks, Diaz brings to this project the same engaging daftness that worked so well in My Best Friend's Wedding and There's Something About Mary. Goofy, vivacious, not at all reluctant to shake her moneymaker - in fact, all of her moneymakers - Diaz has quietly emerged as the film industry's Anti-Gwyneth. Thank God somebody did.</p> <p>Charlie's Angels also stars the intense, seductive, but somewhat monochromatic Lucy Liu and the game, if slightly miscast, Barrymore.</p> <p>As was the case in the TV show, the Angels are three multi-faceted young women who work as private detectives/crimebusters for a man they have never met. They learn of their assignments via an intermediary called Bosley, here played by Bill Murray. Murray has recently made a habit of giving stellar performances in supporting parts (Ed Wood, Rushmore), but this is not one of them. Charlie's Angels is all about the Angels, which is just as well because they look a lot better in those Alpine outfits than he does.</p> <p>As the film begins, the Angels have been hired to find a kidnapped billionaire known as a brilliant software designer. This brings them face to face - or, in this case, cheek by jowl - with Tim Curry, delivering his stock performance as the cheeky rogue. Curry's right-hand man is Crispin Glover, a sadistic, chain-smoking stick figure who seems to be marking time while waiting for Dick Tracy III to start shooting. A decade ago, with films like Back To The Future and River's Edge under his belt, Glover appeared to have a promising future ahead of him. Now he pops up in movies where, by my calculation, he does not deliver a single line. Oh well, at least he's working.</p> <p>In due course, the Angels learn that the kidnapping may be a hoax, that the target of the crime may not be the missing billionaire, that they themselves are being cunningly manipulated. While they are being cunningly manipulated, they have many pleasing costume changes. Generally speaking, the lanky Diaz and the petite Liu attend to the A portion of the T&amp;A show, while the somewhat better-fed Barrymore concentrates on the T segment. Kelly Lynch also does a fine turn as the villainess; it's always nice to see this fetching veteran back in a leather sheath. Or two. Or three.</p> <p>Most of the humour in Charlie's Angels derives from Diaz's adorable klutziness plus her frantic attempts to balance career and personal life. Although she can speak Japanese and is capable of instantly pinpointing a phone caller's location by identifying the rare bird tweeting in the background, she is basically a total airhead. She also has trouble getting dates because today's young men generally opt for more cerebral, serious women and hate females who get dressed up in microscopic shorts and see-through blouses. I know that look was always a turn-off for me.</p> <p>The martial-arts sequences in Charlie's Angels are very good, with the bad guys ultimately getting stomped to smithereens. One might even argue that the film has an artfully concealed feminist subtext, since the three women not only outmuscle the men in the movie but outact them (Matt LeBlanc is invisible, Bill Murray wasted, Tim Curry his usual ham self, Tom Green completely useless, and Sam Rockwell, the kidnap victim, entirely one-dimensional.)</p> <p>Alas, the scene where Diaz lovingly studies her gyrating derriere in a wall-to-ceiling mirror and the numerous sequences where the twin peaks of Mount Barrymore seem to be erupting from her blouse, gown, swimsuit or blanket make it difficult to advance such a theory.

The story is about Cee Harper, a part-time teacher who lives in Trellick Towers, that modernist slab of a tower block at the top end of Notting Hill which so beguiles some of the middle class (but which is convincingly portrayed in this novel as a toilet).

All right, this novel does feature those things, but it also features what goes through the mind of a savvy but internally anxious teacher when she is confronted by four of her hardest, most routinely disrespectful pupils on her way back home. And that is what makes this novel: its creation of Cee Harper's voice, the monologue of an intelligent, alert and thoughtful person to whom bad things start happening. </p> <p>There's another interesting thing Barlay does, or does not do: and that is tell you what his characters look like. In other words, while a detail might slip out here and there, he makes you work a bit before you twig which characters are black. This is not so much colour-blindness as a discreet aversion of the head; and one of the reasons you might do that would be to hear better. You don't have to be a genius to work out what race Georgio Georgianou, the novel's hard man, would describe himself as; but his speech - as is almost everyone's in the novel - is very much supercharged Ali G. Most dialogue closes with the word \"innit\" or \"y'na mean\", which is how \"you know what I mean\" comes out most of the time these days. </p> <p>So what? Well, as Empson said, one of the things, or should I say tings, literature does is to give us sympathetic access to systems of value and belief that are not our own; or, if you prefer, not to look in a mirror but out of the window. I can't completely vouch for Barlay's veracity - but his ear certainly does sound trustworthy. And there are some good jokes here too, such as the one about baklava.</p>",

It took time but he got the ultimate local accolade. \"Hey Solly,\" said a Chicago gangster, embracing the Nobel Laureate of 1976 at the Riviera Club, \"I hear you won the big one.\" </p> <p>James Atlas's biography of Saul Bellow combines scholarship with empathy. No life can \"explain\" art, but the fiction of the \"dangling man\" has been so insistently biographical that it cries out for an account as lucid as this. The making of Bellow is a many-layered thing, and it's all here: the Talmudic ancestors in Tsarist Russia; Abraham reading Chekhov's stories in Yiddish to his sons; Montreal, where the child of the immigrant family spoke French on the streets and read Genesis in Hebrew at home. And - of course - Chicago, where the family finally settled. </p> <p>It was his kind of town, if only because it wasn't New York. Bellow has always needed his willed sense of exclusion. Chicago was mid-western, raw and heterodox, where New York was too obviously sophisticated. The local university was no Ivy League conspiracy of gentlemen whose highest cultural aspiration was to join Eliot and James on the boat back to the old country. Chicago alone could nurture Bellow's mythic sense of the American writer's selfhood. </p> <p>The university's Great Books Program immersed Bellow in an eclectic European tradition: Proustians mingled with Thomists and Plato met Tolstoy. In Chicago - as the local joke had it - Jewish professors taught Roman Catholicism to Protestant students. Anthropology afterwards at Northwestern University gave him an even wider base. The result is Bellow the cultural commentator as well as Bellow the novelist. His characters play with ideas - even, at times, belabour them with a provincial neediness to show off. </p> <p>A succession of wives and girlfriends - as well as grants, scholarships and part-time jobs - emerged from the university system to support Bellow on the way up. Campus characters populate his novels, most movingly in Ravelstein, his effectively biographical study of the late Allan Bloom. But Bellow's are not Bradbury-like novels of \"academic life\". In all their rage and rampage, they are the most accurate imaginative record of the 20th century's American destiny - for good and ill. </p> <p> Henderson the Rain King shows a millionaire explorer unleashed on a continent populated by Uncle Remus-style Africans. It is the unconscious literary reflection of 1950s American colonialism. Mr Sammler's Planet is an angry defence of the \"great tradition\" of rationality and objectivity. Here Bellow embraces the values of those he once rejected - the debilitatingly Anglo-Saxon goyim who used to run American English departments. Atlas shows the range of Bellow's women problems both in life and in art, where the unzipped fly has been a constant companion to the neo-Biblical moralism. His novels offer machismic accounts of fractured egos - protective of their sensitivity, but ready to destroy. The female characters seem vengeful attacks on the women whom he has failed and who have failed him: the Eumenides as viragos. (A one-sided lunch with Margaret Thatcher, who lectured him on Chicago blacks, was an appropriate punishment.) </p> <p>But Bellow's selfish gene is also a thing of genius. He is the explorer of an industrial society that can't accommodate a Prometheus because it limits people to an alloted function. He bemoans the lack of a unified self in modern literature while exploring the consequences of its absence. Haunted, like Allan Bloom, by a dream of the unified western past, he has used that fiction of consensus to castigate a decadent, relativist present. The sensitive eyes and the sensuous lips now sail with rare serenity into another millennium accompanied by another female: his daughter, Naomi, born to an 84-year-old father. To this fertility there seems no end. But there is one explanation - Bellow's own: \"Practice, Practice, Practice\".</p>",

No life can \"explain\" art, but the fiction of the \"dangling man\" has been so insistently biographical that it cries out for an account as lucid as this. The making of Bellow is a many-layered thing, and it's all here: the Talmudic ancestors in Tsarist Russia; Abraham reading Chekhov's stories in Yiddish to his sons; Montreal, where the child of the immigrant family spoke French on the streets and read Genesis in Hebrew at home. And - of course - Chicago, where the family finally settled. It was his kind of town, if only because it wasn't New York. Bellow has always needed his willed sense of exclusion. Chicago was mid-western, raw and heterodox, where New York was too obviously sophisticated. The local university was no Ivy League conspiracy of gentlemen whose highest cultural aspiration was to join Eliot and James on the boat back to the old country. Chicago alone could nurture Bellow's mythic sense of the American writer's selfhood. The university's Great Books Program immersed Bellow in an eclectic European tradition: Proustians mingled with Thomists and Plato met Tolstoy. In Chicago - as the local joke had it - Jewish professors taught Roman Catholicism to Protestant students. Anthropology afterwards at Northwestern University gave him an even wider base. The result is Bellow the cultural commentator as well as Bellow the novelist. His characters play with ideas - even, at times, belabour them with a provincial neediness to show off. A succession of wives and girlfriends - as well as grants, scholarships and part-time jobs - emerged from the university system to support Bellow on the way up. Campus characters populate his novels, most movingly in Ravelstein, his effectively biographical study of the late Allan Bloom. But Bellow's are not Bradbury-like novels of \"academic life\". In all their rage and rampage, they are the most accurate imaginative record of the 20th century's American destiny - for good and ill. Henderson the Rain King shows a millionaire explorer unleashed on a continent populated by Uncle Remus-style Africans. It is the unconscious literary reflection of 1950s American colonialism. Mr Sammler's Planet is an angry defence of the \"great tradition\" of rationality and objectivity. Here Bellow embraces the values of those he once rejected - the debilitatingly Anglo-Saxon goyim who used to run American English departments. Atlas shows the range of Bellow's women problems both in life and in art, where the unzipped fly has been a constant companion to the neo-Biblical moralism. His novels offer machismic accounts of fractured egos - protective of their sensitivity, but ready to destroy. The female characters seem vengeful attacks on the women whom he has failed and who have failed him: the Eumenides as viragos. (A one-sided lunch with Margaret Thatcher, who lectured him on Chicago blacks, was an appropriate punishment.) But Bellow's selfish gene is also a thing of genius. He is the explorer of an industrial society that can't accommodate a Prometheus because it limits people to an alloted function. He bemoans the lack of a unified self in modern literature while exploring the consequences of its absence. Haunted, like Allan Bloom, by a dream of the unified western past, he has used that fiction of consensus to castigate a decadent, relativist present. The sensitive eyes and the sensuous lips now sail with rare serenity into another millennium accompanied by another female: his daughter, Naomi, born to an 84-year-old father. To this fertility there seems no end. But there is one explanation - Bellow's own: \"Practice, Practice, Practice\".",

An unmarried man, without family of his own, he was dependent, emotionally and physically, on others until the day of his death, demanding assurance, consolation, praise and home comforts. In his sixties, he was described by an English visitor to one of his surrogate families as \"a child ... entirely egotistical, innocently vain, the centre of life, interest, concern and meaning to himself\". And after his death the great Danish critic, Georg Brandes, perhaps the first to appreciate quite how extraordinary and innovative his stories were, wrote that \"Andersen's mind was wholly filled by himself\". </p> <p>And yet this self-obsessed man's contribution to literature lies not in the domain of confessional poetry or autobiographical fiction, but in the most objective of forms, the fairy-tale, drawing (at first, directly) from vast reserves of folk-culture, and later fashioning his own archetypal characters and predicaments. True, some of Andersen's most famous stories - \"The Ugly Duckling\", \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\", even \"The Little Mermaid\" - are dramatisations or sublimations of his own dilemmas, but they would not work on us as they do if they did not transcend the personal - in language, in observation and detail, and in intricate but unobtrusive structure - to stand on their own as perfectly wrought artefacts of universal appeal. </p> <p>Andersen's work is not the preserve of sophisticated introverts (as, say, outside the German-speaking world, Rilke's poetry largely is), but has been from the first admired and loved by readers of all ages, all social classes, all countries, all degrees of education. </p> <p>It could be said that inordinate egotism was needed for Andersen to elevate himself at all from the harsh circumstances of his early years. As Jackie Wullschlager observes in this scrupulous and intensely intelligent biography, Andersen's background was humbler, more deprived than that of any comparable writer. He was born in 1805 in Denmark's second city, Odense. His father, a shoemaker and something of an autodidact, was the son of an inmate of the local madhouse and himself not altogether mentally stable. Hans Christian (as the son should always be called) was devoted to him, but lost him when only 11 years old. His mother, Anne Marie, who was older than his father, illiterate but very practical, was left poor; she had a daughter, six years older than Hans Christian, fathered by a married man. Anne Marie's sister ran a brothel in Copenhagen, and Karen-Marie, Hans Christian's half-sister, almost certainly worked as prostitute for some years. </p> <p>Andersen was haunted by these relations of his: he came to view his mother's family as a paradigm of promiscuity and had a terror of them erupting into his own carefully arranged life. As a boy in Odense he was largely left to his own devices. Effeminate and clumsy, as he was to remain his life long, he kept out of the way of other children, and amused himself with his toy theatre and his own imaginings. But ambition, and day-dreams of the great success his unusual personality and gifts surely deserved, also governed his young life, and when he was only 14, he saved up enough money from performance and recitals at middle-class houses to leave Odense for Copenhagen. </p> <p>Denmark - and a major feature of Jackie Wullschlager's book is its rich study of the country during Andersen's life, culturally, sociologically, politically - appears at this time to have been an extraordinarily cohesive society. Copenhagen's upper crust probably consisted of no more than 1,000 people, closely interconnected. After defeat in the Napoleonic wars, Danes seem to have turned away not just from the world arena but from politics altogether, and the arts (especially the theatre) were valued particularly highly. Andersen was thought promising enough to be nurtured and provided with an education. </p> <p>The family who took particular responsibility for him was to remain important to him for the rest of his life - indeed, at his request, two of its members were buried in the same cemetery plot as himself. Jonas Collin was director of the Royal Theatre, \"court official, senior civil servant and well-known philanthropist\", and Andersen never lost either his affection or his awe for the man whom he would call \"Father\". </p> <p>The most important relationship of his life was with Collin's son Edvard. Young Hans Christian adored Edvard and expected from this clever, successful, yet rather cold and conventional person a reciprocation it wasn't in his nature to give. It is hard to warm to Edvard Collin, however great the trouble he took over the business side of Andersen's subsequent literary life. His snootiness towards the vulnerable Hans Christian was at its most conspicuous in his written refusal to permit the use the familiar \"du\" between them. </p> <p>The insecurities of Andersen's start in life permeated his entire career. He always needed the support of those born into a high social sphere - his circle would later include the Danish Royal family - and he never could resist adopting a fawning tone to his hosts and a boastful one to his friends. His craving for fame and approbation was insatiable, and he was assiduous in securing both, though for years Denmark lagged behind other countries (including Britain) in its appreciation of him. Sadly, even the Collin family seem to have lacked a proper appreciation of the gifts of their friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9; to the end they rated other Danish writers above him. </p> <p>The young Andersen had a kind of free-floating creativity. Determined to succeed, no matter in which artistic domain, he produced poems, plays, novels, and regular self-preening, self-bowdlerising autobiographies. He was 30 years old when his first book of fairy-tales appeared. It was very short, only 61 pages long and three of the stories - \"The Tinderbox\" \"Little Claus, and Big Claus\", and \"The Princess and the Pea!\" - derived from stories Hans Christian had heard back in Odense. A second volume of tales came out seven months later. Before long both Andersen and his public understood that it was such tales that showed his imagination and his artistry at their most intense and original. </p> <p> Wullschlager writes with extraordinary clarity and perspicacity about Andersen's productions, relating them to his life and to the culture of the age, but also standing back to reveal their universal, timeless qualities. She shows how revolutionary Andersen's use of objects was. He would animate toys, kitchen utensils, furniture - the entire monde visible - enabling us to perceive every aspect of our lives as metaphoric. Wullschlager also emphasises what too many translators failed to render: the marvellously colloquial language Andersen always employed (even Edvard Collin admired this). It was an emotionally flexible instrument used with unfailing subtlety and power. </p> <p>She also shows us a progression within the fairy-tale oeuvre itself; after the trauma of the Denmark-Prussia wars of 1849-1851 and personal disappointments, the stories darkened and became more artistically adventurous - heralds of modernism (his last story, \"Auntie Toothache\", was his darkest and most modernist). Andersen, for all his folk roots and naivety, always saw himself in the European vanguard, and was as enthusiastic about technical experimentation in the arts as he was about technological progress in society. </p> <p>This outstanding book enlarges our understanding not just of Andersen and his times, but of literature and its relation to the individual and the collective mind. It offers an almost Goya-like portrait of its central figure, yet presents a fuller and more satisfying account of socio-cultural strata than any I have encountered in a literary biography. I do feel, however, that Wullschlager nails Andersen rather too definitely to the mast of homosexuality. Women, pre-eminently the great singer Jenny Lind, obsessed him, and quite patently erotically so. But his was essentially a virginal temperament. </p> <p>Andersen once boasted that while the British Dr Livingstone was a great man, \"he was not loved in the hearts of the world as I am\". Almost 200 years after his birth, we can see how right he was.</p>",

Nowadays, physicists routinely extract entire universes out of nothing - on paper, anyway. Once, multiplying or dividing by zero had terrifying results, reducing orderly arithmetic to instant nonsense. Today, it is a simple trick to recover all the numbers from nothing again. Zero, once a symbol of the void, of absence, of non-being, is now just a location on a number line, an innocuous entry in a string of binary code. </p> <p>The history of how humans learned to love zero involves startling shifts in metaphysics, mathematics and science. These are hard for us to recover. Childhood rhymes are the nearest we moderns get to Platonic knowledge. When the last green bottle accidentally falls, there are no green bottles hanging on the wall. It feels as if we have always known this. So surely everyone else has, too? But the struggle to develop the idea, and the fact that entire civilisations got by without it, attests that zero is a deeply non-obvious notion. </p> <p>The first cultures of counting had no need for zero because numbers were used for recording presence rather than absence. Five thousand years ago, if a victorious Pharaoh captured 100,000 goats, that was worth carving into rock. The fact that no slaves were seized this time did not detain the stonemasons. But the number symbols in Egyptian hieroglyphics, like other ancient numerals, were cumbersome. Ever more complex combinations were needed to denote larger and larger numbers. And each symbol meant the same, wherever it was put. They lacked the elegant economy of place value. </p> <p>That idea, now familiar as the numbers, tens and units on which Mr Blunkett will probably soon be testing three-year-olds, was an extraordinary discovery. What was needed, as the Babylonians first realised, was an extra sign. If a numeral has a different value depending on where it appears in a list, there must be a symbol for an entry in the list which is empty. Enter zero. Not to stand on its own, but to write, say, 1,001, keeping the ones in their place. </p> <p>Eventually, through the Arab numerals we still use, zero became part of the global language of arithmetic. But not without a fight. While eastern cultures had long been comfortable with the idea of nothing as a something, the Greeks, for all their learning, could not countenance it. Their cosmos was both filled out and finite. Embrace zero, and the twin threats of the void and infinity might undermine the foundations of an Aristotelian universe. Not until the European renaissance and the scientific revolution did zero and the infinite come into their own in the west: in perspective drawing, in the infinitesimal divisions of Newton's and Leibniz's calculus, in the recognition that space might extend for ever but need have no content. </p> <p>In some senses, we now know the Greeks' fears of the void to have been unfounded. Since the advent of set theory, a mathematician starting with a representation of nothing can rebuild all the other numbers. The trick is to begin with the empty set, which has no members. Then you can define the number one as the set which contains the empty set as a member - like thinking about a thought. And so on, to infinity. Generated this way, zero nestles at the heart of things inside the endlessly embedded sets, a bootstrap that can pull out an endless ribbon of numbers even though it is tied to nothing. If you buy that, you may also be ready to contemplate modern physicists' notion of the vacuum. They did away with the ether 100 years ago or so, and settled for empty space. They have now repopulated the void with a sea of \"virtual particles\". Quantum mechanics depicts space as a seething foam of uncertainty, with unimaginably short-lived elementary particles continually appearing and disappearing. Contemporary cosmology even suggests that the whole universe might have appeared out of the quantum vacuum: the ultimate free lunch. </p> <p>As these few highlights suggest, there is a lot more to nothing than meets the eye. So perhaps it is not surprising that, in one of those coincidences that amuse readers more than publishers, John Barrow and Charles Seife choose to tell the whole story in almost identical terms. Both are trained mathematicians and gifted popular writers, and both run through pretty much the sequence I have just sketched. Few people will have time for both, but choosing which to read is largely a matter of taste. Seife, in his first book, is breezier, more journalistic, occasionally preoccupied with the personal quirks of great men - as though he is not quite convinced the ideas alone will keep our attention. </p> <p>Barrow, whose previous books include one on theories of everything, is very much at home with his new topic, from his splendid title onward. He is also a professional cosmologist and delves further into the physics, while Seife is mainly preoccupied with mathematics, especially the links between zero and infinity. Both tell a good story, from the Babylonians to Big Bang theorists. Barrow's book is, to my mind, more satisfying, not just because he covers more ground. He has a firmer grasp of the deep metaphysics of being and non-being - though he balks at Sartre, and Heidegger hardly gets a look in. But readers of popular science are well served by Barrow's apparently effortless range of reference. When it comes to explaining the trickiest ideas he often goes the extra mile, which helps you feel you really understand what is going on (while you have the book in your hand, anyway). </p> <p>A telling comparison comes when he and Seife discuss the consequences of the zero-point energy of the vacuum, a property linked with the birth of all those virtual particles. Both are convinced that this is an amazing idea. The zero-point energy is, in theory, infinite. As Seife puts it: \"According to the equations of quantum mechanics, more power than is stored in all the coal mines, oil fields, and nuclear weapons in the world is sitting in the space inside your toaster\". </p> <p>Very striking, but why should we be convinced? Well, although the zero-point energy normally disappears in real life - particles and their twinned anti-particles constantly annihilate each other - it does, in some special circumstances, leave a faint residue that can be measured on an atomic scale. Siefe and Barrow both explain how this registers as a force between microscopically separated metal plates, in an experiment first suggested by the Dutch physicists B G Casimir and Dik Polder. Both explain the origin of the Casimir force in terms of the wavelength of particles. Move the plates close enough together and only some wavelengths will fit between them, creating a kind of pressure from an excess of waves outside that tends to push them closer together still. </p> <p>Barrow, though, fishes a splendid trophy from the physics journals, and points out that a problem in handling sailing ships is just like the Casimir effect. Old nautical manuals warn that two sailing ships positioned side by side in a heavy swell will move toward each other and may collide. The reason turns out to be the same as the cancelling out of wave motions that impels atoms in a vacuum to move closer. This kind of link between the everyday world and the microworld is just what popular-science writers need to help one visualise the strange phenomena they report. Seife is pretty good at spotting them, but Barrow looks further and finds more. Some of the cosmological speculation is still hard to follow, but at least you do not feel that he is holding back from dealing with the most demanding stuff. </p> <p>The same can hardly be said of David Bodanis's E=MC2. Like Seife, Bodanis presents his book as a \"biography\", in this case of Einstein's famous equation. For both this means a sprinkling of personal anecdotes about people who worked with the ideas they write about. But in Bodanis's book the anecdotes all but drive out the ideas. The result is a popular-science book in which the science is present in near homeopathic dilution. More seriously, the celebrated equation makes little sense by itself. As Bodanis says, it is simply a small part of the special theory of relativity, which in turn gave way to the general theory some years later. There is a good deal of history in his book, but little sense of the rich interconnection of a web of ideas that pervades Barrow and Seife's narratives. In fact, they both explain more about relativity than Bodanis. For it turns out that in order to write convincingly about nothing, you really do have to explain just about everything. </p> <p> \u0095 Jon Turney teaches science communication at University College London.</p>",

Nowadays, physicists routinely extract entire universes out of nothing - on paper, anyway. Once, multiplying or dividing by zero had terrifying results, reducing orderly arithmetic to instant nonsense. Today, it is a simple trick to recover all the numbers from nothing again. Zero, once a symbol of the void, of absence, of non-being, is now just a location on a number line, an innocuous entry in a string of binary code. The history of how humans learned to love zero involves startling shifts in metaphysics, mathematics and science. These are hard for us to recover. Childhood rhymes are the nearest we moderns get to Platonic knowledge. When the last green bottle accidentally falls, there are no green bottles hanging on the wall. It feels as if we have always known this. So surely everyone else has, too? But the struggle to develop the idea, and the fact that entire civilisations got by without it, attests that zero is a deeply non-obvious notion. The first cultures of counting had no need for zero because numbers were used for recording presence rather than absence. Five thousand years ago, if a victorious Pharaoh captured 100,000 goats, that was worth carving into rock. The fact that no slaves were seized this time did not detain the stonemasons. But the number symbols in Egyptian hieroglyphics, like other ancient numerals, were cumbersome. Ever more complex combinations were needed to denote larger and larger numbers. And each symbol meant the same, wherever it was put. They lacked the elegant economy of place value. That idea, now familiar as the numbers, tens and units on which Mr Blunkett will probably soon be testing three-year-olds, was an extraordinary discovery. What was needed, as the Babylonians first realised, was an extra sign. If a numeral has a different value depending on where it appears in a list, there must be a symbol for an entry in the list which is empty. Enter zero. Not to stand on its own, but to write, say, 1,001, keeping the ones in their place. Eventually, through the Arab numerals we still use, zero became part of the global language of arithmetic. But not without a fight. While eastern cultures had long been comfortable with the idea of nothing as a something, the Greeks, for all their learning, could not countenance it. Their cosmos was both filled out and finite. Embrace zero, and the twin threats of the void and infinity might undermine the foundations of an Aristotelian universe. Not until the European renaissance and the scientific revolution did zero and the infinite come into their own in the west: in perspective drawing, in the infinitesimal divisions of Newton's and Leibniz's calculus, in the recognition that space might extend for ever but need have no content. In some senses, we now know the Greeks' fears of the void to have been unfounded. Since the advent of set theory, a mathematician starting with a representation of nothing can rebuild all the other numbers. The trick is to begin with the empty set, which has no members. Then you can define the number one as the set which contains the empty set as a member - like thinking about a thought. And so on, to infinity. Generated this way, zero nestles at the heart of things inside the endlessly embedded sets, a bootstrap that can pull out an endless ribbon of numbers even though it is tied to nothing. If you buy that, you may also be ready to contemplate modern physicists' notion of the vacuum. They did away with the ether 100 years ago or so, and settled for empty space. They have now repopulated the void with a sea of \"virtual particles\". Quantum mechanics depicts space as a seething foam of uncertainty, with unimaginably short-lived elementary particles continually appearing and disappearing. Contemporary cosmology even suggests that the whole universe might have appeared out of the quantum vacuum: the ultimate free lunch. As these few highlights suggest, there is a lot more to nothing than meets the eye. So perhaps it is not surprising that, in one of those coincidences that amuse readers more than publishers, John Barrow and Charles Seife choose to tell the whole story in almost identical terms. Both are trained mathematicians and gifted popular writers, and both run through pretty much the sequence I have just sketched. Few people will have time for both, but choosing which to read is largely a matter of taste. Seife, in his first book, is breezier, more journalistic, occasionally preoccupied with the personal quirks of great men - as though he is not quite convinced the ideas alone will keep our attention. Barrow, whose previous books include one on theories of everything, is very much at home with his new topic, from his splendid title onward. He is also a professional cosmologist and delves further into the physics, while Seife is mainly preoccupied with mathematics, especially the links between zero and infinity. Both tell a good story, from the Babylonians to Big Bang theorists. Barrow's book is, to my mind, more satisfying, not just because he covers more ground. He has a firmer grasp of the deep metaphysics of being and non-being - though he balks at Sartre, and Heidegger hardly gets a look in. But readers of popular science are well served by Barrow's apparently effortless range of reference. When it comes to explaining the trickiest ideas he often goes the extra mile, which helps you feel you really understand what is going on (while you have the book in your hand, anyway). A telling comparison comes when he and Seife discuss the consequences of the zero-point energy of the vacuum, a property linked with the birth of all those virtual particles. Both are convinced that this is an amazing idea. The zero-point energy is, in theory, infinite. As Seife puts it: \"According to the equations of quantum mechanics, more power than is stored in all the coal mines, oil fields, and nuclear weapons in the world is sitting in the space inside your toaster\". Very striking, but why should we be convinced? Well, although the zero-point energy normally disappears in real life - particles and their twinned anti-particles constantly annihilate each other - it does, in some special circumstances, leave a faint residue that can be measured on an atomic scale. Siefe and Barrow both explain how this registers as a force between microscopically separated metal plates, in an experiment first suggested by the Dutch physicists B G Casimir and Dik Polder. Both explain the origin of the Casimir force in terms of the wavelength of particles. Move the plates close enough together and only some wavelengths will fit between them, creating a kind of pressure from an excess of waves outside that tends to push them closer together still. Barrow, though, fishes a splendid trophy from the physics journals, and points out that a problem in handling sailing ships is just like the Casimir effect. Old nautical manuals warn that two sailing ships positioned side by side in a heavy swell will move toward each other and may collide. The reason turns out to be the same as the cancelling out of wave motions that impels atoms in a vacuum to move closer. This kind of link between the everyday world and the microworld is just what popular-science writers need to help one visualise the strange phenomena they report. Seife is pretty good at spotting them, but Barrow looks further and finds more. Some of the cosmological speculation is still hard to follow, but at least you do not feel that he is holding back from dealing with the most demanding stuff. The same can hardly be said of David Bodanis's E=MC2. Like Seife, Bodanis presents his book as a \"biography\", in this case of Einstein's famous equation. For both this means a sprinkling of personal anecdotes about people who worked with the ideas they write about. But in Bodanis's book the anecdotes all but drive out the ideas. The result is a popular-science book in which the science is present in near homeopathic dilution. More seriously, the celebrated equation makes little sense by itself. As Bodanis says, it is simply a small part of the special theory of relativity, which in turn gave way to the general theory some years later. There is a good deal of history in his book, but little sense of the rich interconnection of a web of ideas that pervades Barrow and Seife's narratives. In fact, they both explain more about relativity than Bodanis. For it turns out that in order to write convincingly about nothing, you really do have to explain just about everything. \u0095 Jon Turney teaches science communication at University College London.",

When Hedy walks on, there's a sigh of I don't know what. And when I walk on, they say: 'Hi, Judy!'\" Garland was later to revise her opinion of Lana Turner's merits, saying that \"talking to her is like talking to a beautiful vase\", but for that moment, on the edge of womanhood, the child star Judy Garland was not content to be someone people could talk to - she wanted to be precisely the kind of girl no one felt they could talk to. </p> <p>Every movie fan must now have their own immediate, free-associative view of who Judy Garland was - not because she was such a stalwart at MGM (she was fired a number of times), but because she had been with the starry studio since her youth. She grew up in the movies, too fast and not at all, retaining both a childlike energy and a childlike frailty, even as she sabotaged her body with adult weapons. Which Judy Garland first comes to mind? Is it the girl-next-door of the Andy Hardy films, the pigtailed innocent of The Wizard of Oz? Is she the sweet-voiced sister from Meet Me in St Louis or the complicated, gutsy heroine of A Star Is Born? Is she, perhaps, the drug-addled singer who made thousands weep? Is she overweight in your memory or gauntly thin? Is she, only, Liza Minnelli's mother? </p> <p>Her story has been told in countless books and documentaries since her death from a drug overdose in 1969, and one imagines this might create difficulties for the biographer, but Gerald Clarke has his own take on Garland's life. The legend begins with an attempted abortion: Ethel Gumm, the future Judy's mother, already had two children and could not afford or cope with more. She tried to get rid of the child, but a friend told her it could cost her her own life. If she kept the baby, the friend said (with an irony forever lost on Ethel), she would have \"the happiest baby in the world\". When the girl was born, Ethel pinned all her hopes on her - not because she wanted her to be happy, but because she was Ethel's best chance of a ticket out of the sticks and onto the stage. Frances, or Babe, as the youngest was called for many years, had an extraordinary gift: she looked like a child and sang like a woman. </p> <p>The Gumm sisters (sometimes called the Gumdrops, and later changed to the Garland sisters) started out as a trio, with Frances on stage by the age of two, but they ended up leaving Babe, the most popular by far, to give solo performances. Ethel, a wildly pushy, unaffectionate woman, took the role of stage mother to heady new heights. She drove her daughter around the country, accompanying her on the piano. She had her sights set on Hollywood, but her daughter was rejected by everyone there until she changed her name. In the end, it was not Frances Gumm or Frances Garland but Judy who was welcomed with open arms, and by 1935 her mother's stubborn design had been fulfilled. </p> <p>Gerald Clarke brings to the story something that might account for Ethel's disillusioned desperation: her husband, Frank Gumm, was, Clarke writes, \"basically homosexual\". </p> <p>It's a rather casual phrase for such a dramatic revelation - indeed, the revelations are so dramatic that one is inclined to disbelieve Clarke, to think him the sort of biographer who sets out to dredge up scandal or abuse. But he does cite his sources, and after a while, the sources themselves become part of the excitement: Clarke, the author of a bestselling biography of Truman Capote, appears to have an ingenious knack for seeking out the extras in Garland's life. He has spoken to the boy who took the tickets at her father's old movie theatre, to her best friend down the street in the small desert town of Lancaster, California, to a boyfriend from her teenage years; he has consulted local lawyers and barbers, dredged up letters and recorded reminiscences - in short, he has assembled a small army of marginal storytellers, and there seems no reason to suspect the account he gives. </p> <p>The theme continues: Not only was Judy's father servicing boys in the back row of his cinema, but her husband, Vincente Minnelli, was also gay - or, according to Clarke, \"at least largely so\". He would dress up in drag, at least two male actors claimed to have had flings with him, and Clarke gives evidence of one \"almost certain\" other. When colleagues at MGM told Judy they were under the impression that her future husband was not, as they put it, \"marrying material\", she insisted that it was \"just his artistic flair\". Many years later, their daughter Liza discovered her husband Peter Allen in bed with another man - not only that, but, Clarke claims, unbeknownst to either Liza or her mother, Allen was also sleeping with Judy's husband Mark Herron. </p> <p>The story has an almost too-perfect circularity to it, and what, in the end, can we do with this information? Conclude that, since the loves of her life had been gay, Garland became a gay icon, and that the feelings of her fans were reciprocated in ways we could not have known? Clarke makes no connection between husbands and fans, suggesting that her gay following is to do with her audience's affinity with the public abuse she had suffered. The only thing the sexuality of her father and lovers seems to indicate is that she wanted to be loved by men who could not really love her, or that she was afraid of men who might. Feeling unloved is, in any telling, the story of Judy Garland's life; she always dreamed of something better. She said that when she sang \"Over the Rainbow\" it always made her cry, and even the most hardened cynic might, on hearing the cracking voice of late recordings of that song, wonder what had happened to the little girl who first sang it. </p> <p>Although much of Get Happy is taken up with what will for many be a familiar account of loves and losses of self-control, perhaps the most arresting part is the section on Garland's late youth and early adulthood. Through the studio's difficulties in casting her - \"they didn't know what to do with me because they wanted you either five years old or eighteen, with nothing in between,\" she said - something about her can be clearly seen. </p> <p> Garland doesn't seem to have experienced the change from child to adult as a transition, she seems to have carried both extremes within her all her life. This is not merely because of her experiences - the fact that she was singing at the Cocoanut Grove at the age of nine, for instance - it was a strange and unique fusion she possessed. When she was twelve, Garland (then Frances Gumm) performed an act in which she sat on stage covered in a shawl so that only her face was visible in the spotlight. She sang a melancholy torch song with a deep, womanly voice. Only when the applause had started did she throw off the shawl and reveal her childish form; it was this uncanny factor that had audiences raving. But it wasn't always so successful - she tried singing love songs straight, her child's body unhidden, and had to stop, because people thought it just too weird. </p> <p>The studio never really stopped treating her as a child, so much so that it is difficult to think of her as a mother. When she was pregnant with Liza, Louis B Mayer protested, \"we simply can't have that baby have a child!\", and it's as if she made herself unable to deal with adult life, or parental life, by abusing her grown-up body. After several drying-out programs, Garland was sent to a hospital in Boston, where she was particularly popular on the children's ward. \"If I was cured at Peter Bent Brigham,\" she said of the hospital, \"it was only because of those children.\" Clarke writes that she became very close to one girl, who had been so badly abused she had been catatonic for two years. Garland, who had got through her own childhood by singing, spent a good deal of time with the silent girl. At the end of her three-month stay, she went to say goodbye. As Garland bent down to kiss her, the child spoke for the first time. </p> <p>\"Judy!\" she shouted, \"I love you! I love you! Don't leave!\" Perhaps only now did the glamour of the MGM stars seem less significant than being Judy - the person everyone felt they could speak to. </p> <p> \u0095 Gaby Wood is writing a book about dolls and automata for Faber.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 To the Groucho Club, where the usually libertarian regime was severely tested by a party to celebrate The Faber Book of Smoking, edited by James Walton. Such was the fug created by eager puffers that smoke-alarm mayhem was only narrowly averted. That relations between staff and guests remained cordial might be ascribed to the Walton Effect, a peculiar aura of calm and reassurance that led the publisher to relax its deadlines. It was, an employee of Faber remarked, the first time they had seen a manuscript delivered in a crate; neither was there usually so much evidence of scissors and paste, Walton being less than enthusiastic about modern technology. \u0095 Meanwhile, Faber has just signed up another author with an unmistakable aura - Paul McCartney, whose collection of lyrics and poetry will be edited by Adrian Mitchell. According to Mitchell's agent, about three-quarters of the material has never been seen before. Fans of the Beatles and the Frog Chorus need only wait until next March. \u0095 Always keen to celebrate literary milestones, the Loafer notes that November 18 is the day - albeit only in alternate years - that Edward Gorey's celebrated fictional creation Mr Earbrass traditionally begins his new novel. Gorey's The Unstrung Harp, recently reissued by Bloomsbury, is a cautionary tale for any would-be author, particularly in its treatment of celebrity. When Mr Earbrass attends a party at Le Trottoir Imbecile, the talk is of \"disappointing sales, inadequate publicity, worse than inadequate royalties, idiotic or criminal reviews, others' declining talent, and the unspeakable horror of the literary life\". Quite. \u0095 At least Nick Hornby is up-front about cronyism in his latest venture, a collection of stories in support of the Treehouse Trust for autistic children. \"Robert Harris is the editor's brother-in-law,\" reports the Editor's Notes, adding of John O'Farrell: \"He went to the editor's school, funnily enough.\" Meanwhile, Helen Fielding nestles beneath Colin Firth, aka Mr Darcy, and reports herself to be obsessed by him (Mr Darcy, that is). \"Boringly, everyone lives in London,\" the notes end. \u0095 Booker finalist Brian O'Doherty can console himself with his inclusion on another august shortlist. The Literary Review's annual Bad Sex Prize has alighted on the special relationship between man and sheep in O'Doherty's The Deposition of Father McGreevy - alongside squelchy offerings from John Updike, Candida Clark and Jerry Hall's former date Edward St Aubyn. Much to the dismay of booksellers, Margaret Atwood has not been nominated.",

He presented himself as \"The Enemy\", and society took him at his word. Of all the great modernists, Lewis is the one who has stayed out in the cold, despite his double genius as both painter and writer. Walter Sickert called him the \"greatest portraitist of this or any other time\", and T S Eliot described him as \"the greatest prose master of style of my generation\". </p> <p>Lewis wrote like no one else: \"hairy, surgical, and yet invisible\" is a not uncharacteristic Lewis description, while modern society was \"the moronic inferno\". Lewis's punky-looking 1914 publication Blast dished out the praise and blame with deliberately erratic typography and all the aggressive energy that was Lewis's stock in trade. Its blasting and blessing read like a prototype of all those glossy magazine \"In/Out\" lists. \"BLESS the HAIRDRESSER\" runs a typical entry: \"He attacks Mother Nature for a small fee.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, an enthusiasm for short haircuts - excellent though they are - is not irrelevant when it comes to Lewis's politics. Legions of point-scoring bores know that Lewis once wrote a book called The Jews: Are They Human?, although they don't always know that this book - from the calculated obscenity of the title onwards - is a tract against anti-semitism. As Paul O'Keeffe points out in his impressive biography, it not only takes its title from a forgotten humorous bestseller called The English: Are They Human?, but it got a bad review in the Mosleyite British Union Quarterly and a good one in The Jewish Chronicle . </p> <p>That doesn't let Lewis off the hook completely. His Jewish book (and his anti-Nazi book, The Hitler Cult) were part of a damage-limitation exercise, an attempt to undo the gaffe he'd made with his 1931 book Hitler (\"This celibate inhabitant of a modest Alpine chalet - vegetarian, non-smoking, and non-drinking ... the most unassuming of men ...\"). But the inter-war years were a strange time, and Lewis was hardly alone in his extremism: T S Eliot wrote to the Daily Mail to praise the paper's pro-Mussolini stance, George Bernard Shaw hero-worshipped Stalin, and Graham Greene's books had to be re-edited after the war to take the anti-semitic bits out. You can't help feeling there is a touch of scapegoating with Lewis, and a kind of inverse McCarthyism: both the New Statesman and the aptly named Partisan Review spiked pieces on Lewis for not being negative enough. </p> <p>Lewis's political fascination lies not so much in his declared views - perhaps not even in his conscious views - but in the intrinsically political aspect of his sensibility or temperament. Lewis had a strong aesthetic preference for stylisation, and for clean lines and hard surfaces. He liked dynamic stasis and machine-like forms, and he disliked time and flux and subjectivity (which stood him alone against the prevailing 20th-century current of Bergson, Freud, Proust and Joyce). </p> <p>He didn't like messy interior monologues or messy internal organs; instead, he was a man for the carapace. In fact, Wilhelm Reich's hoary old psychosexual idea of \"character armour\" seems oddly appropriate to Lewis. For all its energy, there is often something alienating about Lewis's sensibility. Despite his violent perfection at the level of the phrase, his writing can be unreadably arid over the longer haul of a book. When you realise his comment on W H Auden - \"all ice and wooden-faced acrobatics\" - is intended as praise, it gives you a suspicion that life out there on Planet Lewis might not be quite as we know it. </p> <p>Lewis could be intensely paranoid and prickly, and he seems to have been almost physically incapable of not being rude to people. He had been a great drinking buddy of Joyce (O'Keeffe gives a nice account of them sitting in a Paris gutter together), but he still attacked Joyce's work - brilliantly - in Time and Western Man, then stitched up the Sitwells (and virtually everyone else he'd known, including friends and patrons) in his satirical novel The Apes of God. Editors handled Lewis at their own risk. Times Literary Supplement editor Alan Pryce-Jones (a \"Tory pansy\" anyway, as far as Lewis was concerned) once made some changes to a piece that Lewis had written. Lewis hit back with an almost psychotically sarcastic commentary on the alterations, then threw in a homophobic dig about Pryce-Jones's editorial \"fairy wand\" for good measure. As Anthony Powell puts it, in his wonderfully ponderous High Court judge style: \"The impression ... that all was not well with the balance of Lewis's mind could not be avoided.\" </p> <p>Lewis wasn't all venom. The death of a pet dog would bring out the human being in almost anybody, but instead of just wallowing in sentimentality, Lewis's reflections on the death of his terrier quickly slide to his long-suffering wife, who shared what Lewis felt was ostracism by the envious. \"The death of our hirsute gremlin has left an ugly gap,\" he wrote to a friend. When it came to the world's malice, \"my wife has had to pay as well as myself. So this small creature, which stood for all that was benevolent in the universe, sweetened the bitter medicine for her. Like the spirit of a simpler and saner time, this fragment of primitive life confided his destiny to her, and went through all the black days beside us. She feels she has been wanting in some care ... Such are the reflections that beset her.

His eyesight had been going for some time, and he once tried to hail a hearse instead of a black cab, which must have been a pregnant moment. Finally he had to give up his post as art critic: as he politely explained in the \"unseemly autobiographical outburst\" of his last piece, he could no longer see the pictures. \"Pushed into an unlighted room, the door banged and locked for ever, I shall then have to light a lamp of aggressive voltage in my mind to keep at bay the night.\" </p> <p>Paul O'Keeffe has had a difficult task with Some Sort of Genius: A Life of Wyndham Lewis, because he has had to avoid retreading the steps of Jeffrey Meyer's excellent 1980 biography, The Enemy, which remains the best life of Lewis. O'Keeffe opens with a three-page consideration of a brain tumour, deliberately not saying whose it is, and this is characteristic of a book so packed with circumstantial detail that it sometimes feels as if it should be called Some Sort of Laundry List: A Life of Somebody or Other. Along with an occasional dry wit, O'Keeffe's deadpan deployment of his material makes his book into a literary experiment in its own right. His penchant for giving data on groceries, diphtheria, meteorology and dry rot (or Merulius lacrymans, which even becomes a chapter title) is probably meant to be objectively materialist and impersonal in a way that is appropriate to Lewis, but a stronger sense of form and outline would have been equally appropriate. </p> <p>Like Some Sort of Genius, Paul Edwards's Wyndham Lewis: Painter and Writer has clearly been years in the making. It is not a life but an intensely detailed study of the work, and it is a very handsome book, with several hundred of Lewis's pictures integrated into the dense text. It consolidates Edwards's position as probably the world's leading Lewis scholar, if not his most readable critic, and at least the nitty-gritty closeness of Edwards's discussion does justice to Lewis's own complexity. Edwards's superior factual knowledge allows him to take trenchant issue with other critics and their axe-grinding agendas, including the celebrated American Marxist, Fredric Jameson, who is himself the author of an exceptionally interesting short book on Lewis. </p> <p>Lewis hated mass culture and feared what we would now call \"dumbing down\", but Edwards also brings out his anticipations of pop art, postmodernism and globalisation. Lewis was a genius of multiple self-contradictions, who deserves to be nobody's ideological Aunt Sally.

Covering a period that includes Benvenuto Cellini, the Requiem and The Trojans, and the composer's marriages to the actress Harriet Smithson and the singer Marie Recio, the second volume depicts the post-Romantic musical scene in Balzacian detail, with walk-on appearances by Liszt, Meyerbeer, Mendelssohn, Rossini and Wagner. Its analysis of the works is as acute as that of the subject's moods and relationships. Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII John Cornwell (Penguin \u00a37.99) Buy it at BOL John Paul II plans to canonise Pius XII. But as a Vatican diplomat in the 1930s, the then Eugenio Pacelli masterminded a concordat with Hitler, extending the church's power over Germany's 23m Catholics in exchange for its withdrawal from politics and the disbanding of the Catholic Centre Party. And after becoming Pope in 1939 he refused to condemn Nazism and the Holocaust, failed to protect Rome's Jews, and formed links with Croatia's fascist Ustashe. Rather than a simple indictment, Cornwell's superb biography is a complex study of self-delusion, resembling Gitta Sereny's life of Albert Speer.",

He was among the first to rehumanise the \"dark continent\" for its neighbours through fiction that told its story on its own terms. </p> <p>Moses Isegawa's sprawlingly ambitious first novel, Abyssinian Chronicles, pulls off something of the same feat amid the carnage and chaos of post-independence Uganda. Its title has nothing to do with ancient Ethiopia, but puns on a country that was \"a land of false bottoms where under every abyss there was another one\". </p> <p>First published two years ago in the Netherlands, where Isegawa lives, the novel was hailed as a Ugandan The Tin Drum or Midnight's Children. G\u00fcnter Grass and Salman Rushdie are indeed spectral presences. Yet it has African precedents, too, in perhaps more assured novels of the past 15 years that meld history with myth and metaphor, entwining personal fates with those of nations and communities - from Nuruddin Farah's Maps (1986) and Kojo Laing's Search Sweet Country (1986) to Moyez Vassanji's The Gunny Sack (1989) and Ben Okri's The Famished Road (1991). </p> <p>Nor does Abyssinian Chronicles rely on the \"magical realism\" of Rushdie and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, or the so-called spiritual realism of Okri and his Yoruba forebears. Its mode is gritty, even grungy realism, despite extravagant imagery and an omniscient narrator, Mugezi, who is able to recount the faraway deaths of his father, Serenity, in the jaws of a colossal crocodile, and his mother, Padlock, gored by a bull and tossed \"like a Korean trapeze artist\". </p> <p>Mugezi's watchful, sly intelligence and acerbic, sometimes lacerating tone dominate the novel, in which his coming of age keeps pace with the country's. Born in 1960, with independence, he witnesses the 1966 state of emergency, the rise and fall of Idi Amin and the ousting of the returned dictator Milton Obote in 1986 after renewed civil war. This freewheeling history is grounded in the lives of Mugezi's family - united only when watching Muhammad Ali fights - in coffee-growing swampland festering with illicit passions and religious rivalries. It reaches back to the sectarian battles of the 1950s, as Protestantism and Catholicism vie with Islam and traditional beliefs. </p> <p>Christianity proves a target, notably in Mugezi's parents - Serenity, a \"benevolent dictator\" who takes his wife's aunt as his lover, and Padlock, a disrobed nun who regards semen as \"holy snot\" and is given to \"beating children like drums\". Her aim is to break Mugezi, a \"free spirit with piratical proclivities\", not least through the latrine duties he performs for his younger siblings - unerringly referred to as \"the shitters\". From the urban dystopia of Kampala, where his family settles in the \"red-roofed pretention of a big Indian bungalow\" after Amin's expulsion of Ugandan Asians, Mugezi is banished to a seminary run by tyrants \"programmed to obey and be obeyed\". </p> <p>The novel lingers unduly on Mugezi's swashbuckling run-ins with parents and priests, drawing forced parallels with national authority (he is seduced into adopting Amin as his \"guardian angel\" before adulthood brings an end to the \"flirtation\"). More compelling is the depiction of the apocalyptic legacy of Amin's 3,010 days in power, Tanzanian intervention, and the renewed bush war that follows Obote's return. While Mugezi searches for his dead grandfather, near-skeletons rise from Amin's torture chambers, his henchmen are \"necklaced\", and child guerrillas spread terror. </p> <p>As the decades pass and Mugezi, a corrupt anti-corruption agent, finds his village overrun by coffee-smuggling youths in bell-bottoms, platform shoes and Afro wigs, Isegawa observes how history \"wrote, erased and rewrote itself\". The rebels capture Kampala on the 15th anniversary of Amin's coup; the expelled Indians return under IMF fiat; and war gives way to plague, \"Slim\" or Aids claiming the survivors as surely as Spanish flu did after the first world war. </p> <p>His village - and by implication a whole country-destroyed, the final chapter shifts to Amsterdam, as Mugezi directs his vengeful and war-scarred vision at a European heart of darkness, its aid agencies purveying \"the worst in international beggary, image pillage and necrophilic exploitation\", its red-light cages like slaves' auction blocks. Reborn with a false British passport, Mugezi is a \"rebel on a vague mission\", who finds his metier where \"words were beaten into weapons\". </p> <p>Unsurprisingly given the novel's breadth (Mugezi's affairs with Dutch women perhaps warrant a book in themselves), there is an unevenness in pace and tone. The humanity in the depiction of Mugezi's aunt's death from Aids, and the sympathy for African women as \"olympic medallist camouflagers of pain\" are replaced by a cold misogyny towards Amsterdam prostitutes, and a perfunctory effort to humanise Indian shopkeepers, otherwise seen as \"pirates\" with their \"curried curses\". </p> <p>While the prose can be overwritten (\"vengeance remained sealed in the kaleidoscopic casket of euphoria\"), Isegawa's talent lies in his mordant perspective, his imagery and freshness of language: the Indian community is said to split \"like a jackfruit dropped on concrete\", while the puritanical Padlock, allowing herself to flirt, laughs \"discreetly, as if she were straining a precious liquid through cotton cloth\". Abyssinian Chronicles may lack the sedate control of distance, but it has a momentum and energy that derive from the trauma it tells from the inside.</p>",

She was just out of Cambridge with a first in English, she was a published poet and a French speaker, and she could type. </p> <p>But it wasn't entirely her CV that won her the job. Tomalin's career was launched after she was awarded 7 out of 10 for her looks by one of her future colleagues. \"This is how things were done in 1954,\" she writes in Several Strangers: Writing From Three Decades, her absorbing collection of memoir and journalism that is out in paperback this month. </p> <p>The book opens with Tomalin coming down from Cambridge. But her path into writing had been set much earlier. Her mother had been a songwriter who read a lot of poetry to her daughter. \"Poetry was one of the things that interested me most as I was growing up. I used to write it in my head all the time. I still think the very greatest pleasure in life is to write a poem. When something comes to you, apparently out of nowhere, but only a bit of it so you have to work for weeks to build the rest of the poem.\" </p> <p>Her work had been published at Cambridge, but when some of her poems were rejected by the London Magazine she stopped writing verse. \"I just thought 'That's it'. I think I had realised when I came down from Cambridge that my poetry wasn't really good enough. And looking who came after me\" - Sylvia Plath was in the year below her at Cambridge - \"I was absolutely right. But I do think that all that writing and all that struggling with words has been invaluable. I re-write and re-write endlessly now, and I say it all aloud to myself.\" </p> <p>Though Tomalin was good at publishing, she was aware of the glass ceiling in the industry. \"While women could work for publishers, there was never any question that they would have any power in the firm.\" She reasoned that as she was reading new books and recommending them for publication, it wouldn't be such a great step to become a reviewer. She moved over to journalism and was appointed assistant literary editor of the New Statesman. Her own move into hard covers came when she was on maternity leave from the Statesman in 1971. She sat down with her husband - the journalist Nicholas Tomalin, who was killed in 1973 reporting from the Golan Heights during the Yom Kippur war - and they wrote down all the pros and cons of writing a book. The credit side out-weighed the debit side and so she wrote her first biography. It was of Mary Wollstonecraft, the 18th-century pamphleteer and novelist, and it won the Whitbread first book prize in 1974. </p> <p>Shortly after her husband's death, she was offered the job of literary editor at the Statesman. Her daughter has said that this was the time Tomalin recognisably became the woman she is today. \"I loved running my family and I loved running my department,\" she says. \"I was able to be responsible and I really enjoyed that. And it's also a creative thing running the back half of the New Statesman. You can make judgments about books and promote them. You can find writers. It was terrific.\" She also acted as a one-woman finishing school for a new generation of British fiction writing, and her deputies over the years included Martin Amis, Julian Barnes and Timothy Mo. </p> <p>Tomalin went on to write acclaimed biographies of Shelley, Nelly Ternan, Dora Jordan, Jane Austen and Katherine Mansfield (about whom she also wrote a play). She was asked, too, to write a biography of Sylvia Plath, and she agreed - but Ted Hughes vetoed the project. \"My husband\" - she has been married to the novelist and playwright Michael Frayn since 1976 - \"said it was a lucky escape. But that's not quite how I feel about it even now.\" </p> <p> Several Strangers includes Tomalin's review of Janet Malcolm's controversial 1994 biography of Plath. \"It is not really much concerned with Sylvia Plath and not at all with her poetry.\" she wrote. \"It is deeply concerned with the nastiness of biography, and with interviewing and the impossibility of objectivity.\" Tomalin defends biography as a form, saying: \"Janet Malcom was naughty. People who attack biography choose as their models vulgar and offensive biography. You could equally attack novels or poems by choosing bad poems or novels.\" </p> <p>She says that finding the right tone for the autobiographical sections of Several Strangers was difficult - \"other people are involved; children, friends, family\" - but she hopes one day to write a full-scale memoir. In the meantime she has plenty going on. She is currently \"deeply absorbed in the 18th century\", working on a biography of Pepys. \"He's one of the great writers in the English language, but he has never been studied as literature in the universities so he's wonderfully fresh. The writing of the diary is terrific. It is so flexible and vivid and concise. He gives an anatomy of himself and of the world.\" </p> <p>A paperback edition of her Jane Austen biography, with new information about Austen's aunts, is also published this month. \"I continually get more information about a subject after the book has been published. But with Jane Austen I didn't really think this would be the case, so I am delighted to have been sent something new. It's the most wonderful aspect of biography that these books can have lives after they are published.\" </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501841569,00.html\">Buy Several Strangers at BOL</a> <br></p>",

In the meantime she has plenty going on. She is currently \"deeply absorbed in the 18th century\", working on a biography of Pepys. \"He's one of the great writers in the English language, but he has never been studied as literature in the universities so he's wonderfully fresh. The writing of the diary is terrific. It is so flexible and vivid and concise. He gives an anatomy of himself and of the world.\" A paperback edition of her Jane Austen biography, with new information about Austen's aunts, is also published this month. \"I continually get more information about a subject after the book has been published. But with Jane Austen I didn't really think this would be the case, so I am delighted to have been sent something new. It's the most wonderful aspect of biography that these books can have lives after they are published.\" Buy Several Strangers at BOL",

A book of criticism is usually like a long plumber's whistle, or an irritated shake of the head, and reading it is about as much fun as sorting nails or sifting thistles. </p> <p>A S Byatt's On Histories and Stories is another kind of criticism. Byatt is no grumbler. In her discussion of works of fiction, rather than judging weaknesses she sets out to account for strengths. She talks things up. You get the impression that she actually enjoys reading. On Histories and Stories is therefore criticism as it used to be written, before critics toned up on theory and pigged out on cultural studies, and before what Byatt calls that \"gladiatorial antagonism\" developed between writers and critics. </p> <p>Byatt discusses contemporary fiction but ignores pulp. She engages with ideas but avoids jargon. The book probably contains fewer niggles and prickles than the average work of polemics or scholarship, but more than the average weight of subtleties and insights. In seven chapters - on \"Fathers\", \"Forefathers\", \"Ancestors\", et cetera - Byatt sets out to explore the various uses and meanings of historical fiction, and discusses her own methods in composing novels, novellas and short stories. The essays are, she claims in her introduction, \"a writer's essays\". </p> <p>Many of them are also, it should be said, lecture notes, and there is a certain tone, both authoritative and casual, that indicates their true origins. \"I shall come back to the the opposition of probability and chance, both as subject and as form of the novel later,\" Byatt announces to her empty auditorium. She waves and signposts, with a rather aristocratic and proprietorial air, directing the traffic and attention like the lady of the manor who has opened up the house for the summer. \"Come on, hurry up, please, into the library. Chop chop. Now, look! Look over there. Yes, look at all this terrific literature!\" </p> <p>In discussing and enthusing about writers and their works - from The Arabian Nights to Lawrence Norfolk - Byatt summarises neatly and quotes wonderfully. The quotations are often lengthy, and there are many of them. This matters. \"Next to the originator of a good sentence is the first quoter of it,\" wrote Emerson ( Journals , volume 16). \"My quotations\", Byatt claims, \"are like the slides in an art historical lecture.\" They are in fact nothing like so dull and flat. It's more like listening to someone humming arias - pleasant, but occasionally irritating. Her embellishments can be rather artless. </p> <p>The Irish, apparently, \"argue beautifully and passionately\" and \"are happy to suppose that English writing can be dismissed\". This is caricature. She is also prone to digression and doodle. \"It is interesting to compare Free Fall with Earthly Powers.\" \"It is interesting to compare Hawksmoor with William Golding's The Spire , which is also about the building of churches.\" \"It is interesting also to compare Ackroyd's thresholds between past and present with a recent novel by a young Scottish writer, A L Kennedy.\" The comparisons and intuitions are often stimulating, but sometimes insubstantial: as with a flirtation, the expression of interest becomes the interest itself. </p> <p>The book contains, nonetheless, some important insights. Her reading of contemporary fiction as a series of plays on certain Darwinian plots is illuminating. For example, it allows her to read Penelope Fitzgerald's novel The Gate for Angels through Ian Hacking's book about probability, The Taming of Chance, and her summary of Fitzgerald's book reveals exactly what is surprising and disturbing about its apparent simplicity - that sense that \"there is more here, more significance, than the sheer pleasure of elegant prose and the satisfactory storytelling\". Fitzgerald, she concludes, is \"playing lightly with the random and haphazard, in the form of her novel and in life\". </p> <p>What Byatt won't admit about historical fiction, though, despite all her talk of such subtle plottings, is its determined thrust and ambition. The historical novel may throw light upon modern sensibilities, and may often be an example of considerable ingenuity, and even an expression of great moral seriousness, but it is also an example of the will to power. \"Playing lightly\" it is not. The historical novel is always boasting about its knowhow, whether it's by Penelope Fitzgerald or Norman Mailer. It loves to display its credentials. It preens. It knows how to sell itself. And above all, it desires success. One suspects that Byatt, author of the bestselling Possession , knows more about this - the real secret of histories and stories - than she is letting on.</p>",

It was at a time when an election was approaching and he worked on the rebuttal work that came to characterise the last election. \"The phone would ring and it would be a high profile former minister wanting some information. There was no time to become flustered or anxious - it was just a case of getting on with it.\" Dossetter spent the second six months working for Canadian MP Sheila Finestone in Montreal. \"In many ways this was the more demanding experience. I arrived at Ottawa University with nothing set up and had to go out and find an MP to aid. Whereas I was one of five in Ted Heath's office, there were just two of us helping Finstone. The experience in London had given me an insight into the political process and I was able to put some of that into practice in Montreal. Asked what he got out of the year, Dossetter suggests the most valuable thing was self-confidence. \"Just to get the job with Ted Heath I had to get through two pretty tough interviews, and dealing with some of the country's leading politicians on a daily basis was invaluable experience. Besides that it was fun. Sitting in the bar at the House of Commons after a long day, you'd look round and think, wow, this is where it all happens.\"",

      "bodyText": "Tara Mitchell was probably destined to join the police. At 16 she was a police cadet in Surrey and at 18 she was a special constable. \"I was involved with recruitment campaigns and training,\" she explains. After graduating in social psychology from the University of Kent, Tara applied direct to the county constabulary. \"Policing appeals because I am interested in what people do and why they do it.\" How to join: Graduates can enter either by the Home Office's Accelarated Promotion Scheme for Graduates (12 each year, nationwide) or by approaching an individual force and applying to join the APSG. Kent police also runs a development scheme for officers with potential. CV to date: Fifteen weeks intitial training forms the first part of a two-year probationary period which includes attachments to various sections. Tara's experience has included spells in the intelligence and uniform response patrol units. Training involves residential courses and annual appraisals. Ambitions? Tara is working towards her inspectors exam next year. Tip for entrants: \"Go to your local police and find out directly what the job's like.\" \u0095 For more career details visit the website www.kent.police.uk.",

It kept on rewinding to a point where he couldn't identify the tape any longer. \"Rudi [Koertzen] was calling for the angle from that camera, and while the video-tape operator was try ing to find it, the delay was longer than normal and the decision was taken in the favour of the batsman. \"The operator couldn't find the footage and the machine jammed the tape. It got chewed up. We went back and found that section of the tape and we've gone to air with it and proved that Kallis was, in fact, not out.\" It was the second time that the system has failed on the present tour of South Africa, the country which pioneered television umpiring. The first occurred in Kimberley last month, when a power failure prevented the third umpire from deciding if Jonty Rhodes threw down Roger Twose's stumps with the Kiwi yet to score. He went on to make 89. - Reuters SOUTH AFRICA First innings H H Dippenaar c Astle b O'Connor 0 G Kirsten c Astle b Martin 31 J H Kallis not out 153 D J Cullinan b Walker 29 N D McKenzie not out 42 Extras (b4 lb5 nb6) 15 Total (for 3, 83.4 overs) 270 Fall: 0, 97, 164.

Not lending his name to a ghosted column, not offering an overview of England's latest tour, but doing the nitty-gritty, dirt-under-the-fingernails, real work: he has filed a match report. </p> <p>Clearly Atherton is not the first cricketer to work in the business (our own Mike Selvey heads a distinguished roster of former Test players in the press box, including Derek Pringle of the Independent and Vic Marks of the Observer). But he must be the first to assault the word processor before he has even retired. And just to add extra flavour to his journalism, his was a report of a match in which he was actually playing. </p> <p>As might be expected from a man as intelligent and well read as Atherton, there is nothing wrong with his copy. Nevertheless, it is a worrying piece of casting by the Telegraph, raising all sorts of questions about objectivity. Would the paper recruit Gordon Brown to write its economic comment column, for instance, or get David Blunkett to spin off a couple of hundred words about the National Union of Teachers' conference? Of course not. But then, being the Telegraph, they don't need to. They have Chris Woodhead to do that sort of thing. But how about getting Lennox Lewis to deliver the only piece the paper carried about his fight with David Tua? Or asking Gareth Southgate to write the definitive report when England lost to Germany in last month's World Cup qualifier? </p> <p>As it happens, Atherton and his new employer were lucky with his first piece. England won the pre-Test final warm-up match, so there was no need for any critical response. Plus they did so without much of a contribution from their reporter, who could thus maintain an illusion of distance. But what would have happened if, say, England had batted as they did in the early stages of their most recent tour to South Africa and one of their own was obliged to comment on abject capitulation? In such circumstances it is inconceivable that Atherton - always careful to respect his colleagues' feelings - would have been appropriately judgmental. </p> <p>Perhaps the paper's editors thought that the compromise of allowing a player to fudge criticism in a match report would be offset by insider titbits. In which case they should have asked somebody other than Atherton. He is far too canny, far too experienced, far too aware of the consequences on team morale to give a single thing away. In 900 words, the only deep-throat insight he delivered was a comment from Graham Thorpe so bland it is not worth repeating. </p> <p>But the most entertaining possibilities of the Telegraph's recruitment drive are offered up when their new employee is obliged to report on himself. When I was at school, I had a contemporary called Michael Bennett, who used to provide hilariously egocentric running commentaries on every football match. On one occasion, one of our team-mates won the ball in defence and proceeded to dribble through the opposition before scoring a solo barnstormer. The commentary on this wonder goal provided by the wannabe John Motson, a spectator at right-back, was: \"And Bennett lurks . . .\" </p> <p>This was at the same school Atherton attended, and maybe he played with Bennett's younger brother. Certainly his own reporting style eschews all ego, preferring instead shoulder-shrugging self-deprecation, as might be expected from someone who is not exactly the Naseem Hamed of cricket. </p> <p>Referring to himself as Marcus Trescothick's opening partner, the Sunday Telegraph's man reserves the only critical comment of his piece for the way \"a long hop was cut to cover point for the second time on the tour\". This before adding: \"I hope the habit of gifting my wicket to the opposition comes to an end before the first Test.\" It is a style which would have been in trouble if he had been reporting on the first day of this Test match, a day summed up in the Guardian's headline: \"England fall in a heap after Atherton heroics\". Self-criticism would be as inappropriate then as excuse-making is in defeat. </p> <p>But ultimately there is one overriding reason why I object to Atherton writing match reports for the Telegraph.

A turning pitch, albeit a slow one, and Asian spinners - not just any old spinners but great ones, among the finest in the world - would on the face of it amount to a recipe for defeat and probably an embarrassing one at that. Instead it was England who went into today's fourth day cracking the whip, dictating the terms and putting pressure on the opposing batsmen; it was they whose spinners had a coterie of predatory fieldsmen lurking and smirking round the bat while the Pakistanis tried to find a happy medium between studious defence and outrageous hitting. Patience was a virtue exhibited with great merit by England's batsmen and if it is transferred to the bowlers it could yet hold the key, if not to winning the match then to sending Pakistan to the second Test in Faisalabad with a thought or two about pitch preparation, selection and strategy.

So Pakistan resumed this morning on 119 for two, with Salim Elahi, a batsman of little experience or record who has not played Test cricket for 3 years, on 15 and Inzamam-ul-Haq, who can be exceptional, on 11.

      "body": "<p>\"I don't care who they are, where they are from or what they have done,\" the former Manchester United goalkeeper Alex Stepney says. \"When those players walk out at Maine Road they will know that this is a massive game\". </p> <p>Tony Book, who spent three decades at Maine Road as player, manager and coach, agrees. \"The atmosphere will just drag them in.\" </p> <p>Some recurring events seem forever trapped in a single period of time. For many the words \"heavyweight title fight\" will always conjure up black-and-white footage of Muhammad Ali, arms raised above his head, feet double-shuffling across the canvas. Likewise for football fans of a certain age, mention of the Manchester derby is likely to call forth images of strikers in red or sky-blue shirts wheeling away from the goal with a single arm raised in celebration, of bare-handed goalkeepers and pitch invasions by fuzzy-haired hordes wearing scarves as bracelets. </p> <p>That was Book and Stepney's time, an era when the two Manchester clubs were both major forces in European football. Both men arrived in Manchester in 1966 with City newly promoted and they first experienced the momentous fixture on the same September Saturday. </p> <p>The Surrey-born Stepney, who finished on the winning team that afternoon, went on to make 535 appearances for United. A rangy, agile figure, he kept those in front of him firmly in order. Peter Schmeichel was unlikely ever to win a prize from the Noise Abatement Society but at St Andrews in 1976 Stepney set a benchmark for custodial loudness that is never likely to be surpassed, dislocating his jaw while shouting at Martin Buchan. These days he is the goalkeeping coach at Maine Road while, with pleasing symmetry, the one-time City keeper Tony Coton fulfils the same role at Old Trafford. </p> <p>Book, meanwhile, has a good claim to be a unique player of the modern age. Snapped up for \u00a315,000 from Plymouth Argyle by Joe Mercer, the elegant full-back did not make his First Division debut until he was 31. </p> <p>From their first day in the city neither man was left in any doubt about the importance of the game. \"There were the supporters, of course,\" Book recalls in the west country burr that 30 years in the north-west have barely altered. \"But more than that it came from the other players. Our side had a lot of local lads: Glyn Pardoe, Alan Oakes, Neil Young and Mike Doyle. They let you know what it was all about; Mike Doyle especially. It meant a lot to Doyley to go out for a drink on the Saturday night after winning the derby.\" </p> <p>\"In those days,\" Stepney says, \"you didn't have a lot of people coming in from outside. The TV crews and reporters tended to be local so everything was focused on Manchester. You were stuck right in the middle of it and all week it just built up and built up.\" </p> <p>For Stepney, the intensity inevitably affected the players' attitude. \"Matt Busby would give his usual team talk - 'play your game, enjoy yourself' - but when you walked down that tunnel inwardly you felt the opposite. It wasn't about how we played but about how we stopped them playing. It was about who you were going to cancel out.\" </p> <p>With two teams boasting players of the calibre of Denis Law, Colin Bell, Bobby Charlton, Francis Lee and Mike Summerbee there was plenty for defenders to fret about. And then there was George Best. \"Funnily enough, I never had much trouble off Bestie,\" Book says. \"I stuck close by him. I used to run along beside him shouting, 'Pass it, you beggar, pass it!' Because once he'd released it he couldn't do you any damage.\" The tactic proved so successful Doyle later said the City players never worried about Belfast Boy because they knew Book would nullify him. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly the tension sometimes spilled over into violence. During the 1974 clash at Maine Road a fight broke out between Lou Macari and the ever-feisty Doyle, whose contempt for all things United was not entirely a media creation. </p> <p>The referee, Clive Thomas, sent both off. When they refused to go the idiosyncratic Welshman led both sides off instead. After five minutes two 10-man teams returned to the field and played out a goalless draw. \"Things could get a bit heated,\" Book observes with a wry smile. </p> <p>Though neither man regards the encounter as ever being particularly dirty, the casualty list is alarming. In his two dozen derby appearances Stepney saw Bell's career finished when a Buchan tackle broke his leg, and Best shatter Pardoe's tibia, an injury that reportedly came close to ending with amputation. </p> <p>In the days before the team physio, healthcare was often in the hands of a retired pro armed with a bucket and sponge whose prescription to everything from a calf strain to concussion was to soak the wounded part in hot water. The result was sometimes gruesomely comic. </p> <p>\"When John Aston broke his leg in the derby it happened a few minutes before half-time,\" Stepney recalls with the grim relish of one for whom pain is an occupational hazard. \"When he came off he said to our trainer, Jack Crompton, 'There's something the matter. My leg's all numb.' Jack told him to stamp up and down a few times to get the circulation going. You could hear the bone jarring together.\" </p> <p>In the stands things were often just as bloodcurdling. \"The atmosphere was definitely hostile,\" Book remembers. \"The team coach would always be showered with spit when you travelled to Old Trafford.\" Games on the last day of the season in 1973 and 1974 both ended prematurely with mass pitch invasions, the latter in an attempt to stop a match in which, traumatically, the former Old Trafford idol Law's instinctive back-heeled goal for City sent the Red Devils down. </p> <p>Book was manager of the City side that day and, though he enjoyed the win, the relegation of United saddened him. \"To our fans it was maybe a big thing but it gave me no satisfaction, none whatsoever.\" </p> <p>To many City fans it sometimes appears that United have set out almost deliberately to rob them of glory, typically trumping the Maine Road club's 1967-68 league championship by winning the European Cup. To Book, though, the motivation for beating United was never resentment. \"They had this aura of being the bigger club and we just wanted to change that. When we went to Old Trafford in the early days Malcolm Allison used to take us out on to the pitch before we'd got changed. We'd go down to the Stretford End and applaud United's fans. It was his way of showing that we weren't going to hide away. We were going to take them on and turn things around.\" </p> <p>And they succeeded, too. Book played in 16 derbies and finished on the losing side in only three. Stepney, on the other hand, played in 24 and won only eight. \"The first few of my games against them we did pretty well,\" the keeper concedes, \"but then at the end of the 67-68 season they came to Old Trafford and won 3-1. To me that was the turning point.\" </p> <p>It is also the game of which Book has the fondest memories. \"I played sweeper,\" he recalls. \"Bestie scored early and I thought we were really up against it. But we played our way out of it. That was the thing to me. Because our philosophy was that first off you wanted to get the result and after that you wanted to get it with style. And that's what we did that day.\" </p> <p>Today, in the first Manchester derby since April 1996, a repeat may seem unlikely. United have won their last eight games, City have lost their last three. Book, however, remains convinced that form is immaterial. \"In a big game anything can happen,\" he says, \"and this is the big one, make no mistake about that.\" </p> <p>\u00a3#149;In all United have won 53 derbies to City's 36, with 46 draws. For City fans too young to remember seeing them win, here is the proof that they once did - and in style. </p> <p><strong> September 23 1989</strong> </p> <p><strong> Man City 5 Man Utd 1 </strong> </p> <p>City: Oldfield (2), Morley, Bishop, Hinchcliffe</p> <p>United: Hughes </p> <p>City's only win since 1981, but what a win. Both clubs were looking shaky, City newly promoted and with only four points from their first six games, while United were in the middle of Michael Knighton's attempted takeover. Alex Ferguson, whose Old Trafford future seemed precarious, claimed he had never seen a worse defensive performance. \"It was like climbing a glass mountain,\" he said. </p> <p><strong> November 12 1975</strong> </p> <p><strong> Man City 4 Man Utd 0 </strong> </p> <p>City: Tueart (2), Hartford, Royle </p> <p>City could not stop scoring (22 in all) on the way to winning the League Cup, their last major trophy. Three goals up after half an hour in this fourth round tie, they ripped Tommy Docherty's young side to shreds with what the Guardian called \"football of classical dimensions, fluent, imaginative, decisive, at times breathtaking\". The only black spot for City was the injury to Colin Bell, which effectively ended his career. </p> <p><strong> April 27 1974</strong> </p> <p><strong> Man Utd 0 Man City 1 </strong> </p> <p>City: Law </p> <p>The famous day when the backheel from United's old boy Denis Law five minutes from time sent his former club into the Second Division, although in fact a draw would have been no use to them either. Law's goal sparked a pitch invasion which ended the game prematurely, prompting calls for the erection of fences at English grounds. </p> <p><strong> March 27 1968 </strong> </p> <p><strong> Man Utd 1 Man City 3 </strong> </p> <p>United: Best </p> <p>City: Bell, Heslop, Lee (pen) </p> <p>The season is better remembered for United's European Cup victory, but it was City who won the league. With 10 games to go, City were two points behind Manchester United and Leeds. This win turned the tide. By the end, the attractive side built by Joe Mercer was so firmly in command they \"committed the unforgivable sacrilege of toying with United\".</p>",

It is this attitude which separates England from countries such as France, Holland, Germany, Brazil, Italy or Argentina, where the game is rated as highly as a career in one of the established professions. Here it is not so much a question of intelligence as opportunity.",

      "body": "<p>Paul Dickov is not entirely certain whether it is fame of infamy, but either way he is certainly a man in demand. At his home in a picture-book corner of Cheshire, he has more than 30 interview requests to sift through. How, he wonders aloud, has every bugger got his number? </p> <p>When Manchester City dusted down their red carpet for George Weah at the start of the season, Dickov was swiftly touted as favourite for the guillotine, the overwhelming consensus being that he would be shipped out, best wishes and all, to the backwaters of the Nationwide League. </p> <p>Instead, it has been a triumph for the little man. Weah, the one-time world footballer of the year, who has been there, done that and could set up a market stall with all the T-shirts, has disappeared in a huff after being left to collect splinters on the bench. And Dickov, having failed to command a regular place in the Second Division two seasons ago, has established himself as City's talisman in attack. </p> <p>Today, in the first Manchester derby for four years, the only reminder of Weah at Maine Road will be the queue of fans who have been offered refunds on the replica shirts with his name on. </p> <p>Dickov, by contrast, is settled with his family in Bowdon, the footballer's enclave populated by, among others, Roy Keane, Fabien Barthez and Teddy Sheringham - \"I'm all right,\" he says, \"the paparazzi don't usually recognise me\" - and having acquired a taste for the Premiership he clearly intends to be around for some time yet. </p> <p>\"Two years ago we were going to Chesterfield, Colchester and Lincoln. I wasn't always playing and we were losing to the likes of Wycombe. When you look back at that season, it's impossible for me not to be enjoying this now. </p> <p>\"They were desperate times for a club of this size and, as a player, it was embarrassing. People say I'm part of the squad that has taken us up to the Premiership, but I was also part of one that took us down to the Second Division. During those days it was best to keep a low profile around Manchester. You certainly couldn't have imagined us taking on United.\" </p> <p>Dickov has always been an important piston in the machinery but it is only now, after a career that flickered without truly igniting at Arsenal, that he seems comfortable in the higher echelon. Where he once shuffled, he now has a swagger to his play. And his updated curriculum vitae not only incorporates an impressive assist in precipitating Weah's departure from Maine Road but, at the age of 28, the green shoots of an international career with Scotland. </p> <p>For all his powers of longevity, however, his route back to the Premiership has been anything but uncomplicated. When he left Arsenal for City four years ago he called his Highbury team-mates together and confidently predicted he \"would see them soon\". Not since Michael Fish swatted rumours of a hurricane can there have been a more rickety promise. </p> <p>\"City had just been relegated to the First Division so I was thinking to myself: 'We'll be promoted this season and I'll be back in the Premiership next year'\" he says. \"You could say it has taken a bit longer than I hoped.\" </p> <p>Joe Royle's men have been to hell and back (and very nearly Hull and back) but, for Dickov, the stomach-jolting highs and lows began long before that when, having signed for Alan Ball on a Friday, his new manager was promptly sacked on the Sunday. </p> <p>Along the way, there have been plenty of other troubled times, too. \"There were spells when I wasn't playing and I thought I might have to move on but the gaffer has always given me the incentive to stay by saying he wants me to stick around. </p> <p>\"Sometimes it makes you feel like one of the cleaners, but even when I have been out of the side I could never have slagged him off. He's always been honest with me and that's all you can ask for. And look, I'm still here.\" </p> <p>Even after the much-trumpeted arrival of Weah. \"Yeah, I suppose I'm notorious now. You try to believe in yourself but when the gaffer signed George I did think: 'God, look what I am up against here.' For me to have been picked above him was a big compliment,\" he says. </p> <p>\"If George was bitter, I saw nothing of it. But he said a few things in the press afterwards and, if he had that attitude, maybe it was better he left when he did because with the bunch of lads we've got at City there's no room for that. </p> <p>\"To us though, he was always a gentleman. He had an aura about him and there were certainly no ego problems in the dressing room. In fact, it was the opposite. You would see him talking to the young lads and giving them advice. When he left he came in and shook everyone by the hand but he had obviously had enough.\" </p> <p>Dickov has chiselled a place in the club's annals with his knack of scoring important goals and City, as mawkish as ever, have just cleared a space in their museum for the patch of grass where he arrowed that oh-so-late equaliser in their Second Division play-off final against Gillingham. </p> <p>A framed photograph of the knee-sliding goal celebrations is hanging in his study but however exhilarating it was to score at Wembley his pi\u00e8ce de resistance will always be tinged by a slight sense of embarrassment. Gillingham's goalkeeper that pivotal afternoon was Vince Bartram, for whom Dickov was best man and whose wife Tracey is godparent to his daughter Lauren. \"We're still talking,\" smiles Dickov, who has whiled away many a happy hour watching the match video. Should he be City's hero yet again today, he might just be offered the Freedom of Moss Side.</p>",

When Manchester City dusted down their red carpet for George Weah at the start of the season, Dickov was swiftly touted as favourite for the guillotine, the overwhelming consensus being that he would be shipped out, best wishes and all, to the backwaters of the Nationwide League. Instead, it has been a triumph for the little man. Weah, the one-time world footballer of the year, who has been there, done that and could set up a market stall with all the T-shirts, has disappeared in a huff after being left to collect splinters on the bench. And Dickov, having failed to command a regular place in the Second Division two seasons ago, has established himself as City's talisman in attack. Today, in the first Manchester derby for four years, the only reminder of Weah at Maine Road will be the queue of fans who have been offered refunds on the replica shirts with his name on. Dickov, by contrast, is settled with his family in Bowdon, the footballer's enclave populated by, among others, Roy Keane, Fabien Barthez and Teddy Sheringham - \"I'm all right,\" he says, \"the paparazzi don't usually recognise me\" - and having acquired a taste for the Premiership he clearly intends to be around for some time yet. \"Two years ago we were going to Chesterfield, Colchester and Lincoln. I wasn't always playing and we were losing to the likes of Wycombe. When you look back at that season, it's impossible for me not to be enjoying this now. \"They were desperate times for a club of this size and, as a player, it was embarrassing. People say I'm part of the squad that has taken us up to the Premiership, but I was also part of one that took us down to the Second Division. During those days it was best to keep a low profile around Manchester. You certainly couldn't have imagined us taking on United.\" Dickov has always been an important piston in the machinery but it is only now, after a career that flickered without truly igniting at Arsenal, that he seems comfortable in the higher echelon. Where he once shuffled, he now has a swagger to his play. And his updated curriculum vitae not only incorporates an impressive assist in precipitating Weah's departure from Maine Road but, at the age of 28, the green shoots of an international career with Scotland. For all his powers of longevity, however, his route back to the Premiership has been anything but uncomplicated. When he left Arsenal for City four years ago he called his Highbury team-mates together and confidently predicted he \"would see them soon\". Not since Michael Fish swatted rumours of a hurricane can there have been a more rickety promise. \"City had just been relegated to the First Division so I was thinking to myself: 'We'll be promoted this season and I'll be back in the Premiership next year'\" he says. \"You could say it has taken a bit longer than I hoped.\" Joe Royle's men have been to hell and back (and very nearly Hull and back) but, for Dickov, the stomach-jolting highs and lows began long before that when, having signed for Alan Ball on a Friday, his new manager was promptly sacked on the Sunday. Along the way, there have been plenty of other troubled times, too. \"There were spells when I wasn't playing and I thought I might have to move on but the gaffer has always given me the incentive to stay by saying he wants me to stick around. \"Sometimes it makes you feel like one of the cleaners, but even when I have been out of the side I could never have slagged him off. He's always been honest with me and that's all you can ask for. And look, I'm still here.\" Even after the much-trumpeted arrival of Weah. \"Yeah, I suppose I'm notorious now. You try to believe in yourself but when the gaffer signed George I did think: 'God, look what I am up against here.' For me to have been picked above him was a big compliment,\" he says. \"If George was bitter, I saw nothing of it. But he said a few things in the press afterwards and, if he had that attitude, maybe it was better he left when he did because with the bunch of lads we've got at City there's no room for that. \"To us though, he was always a gentleman. He had an aura about him and there were certainly no ego problems in the dressing room. In fact, it was the opposite. You would see him talking to the young lads and giving them advice. When he left he came in and shook everyone by the hand but he had obviously had enough.\" Dickov has chiselled a place in the club's annals with his knack of scoring important goals and City, as mawkish as ever, have just cleared a space in their museum for the patch of grass where he arrowed that oh-so-late equaliser in their Second Division play-off final against Gillingham. A framed photograph of the knee-sliding goal celebrations is hanging in his study but however exhilarating it was to score at Wembley his pi\u00e8ce de resistance will always be tinged by a slight sense of embarrassment. Gillingham's goalkeeper that pivotal afternoon was Vince Bartram, for whom Dickov was best man and whose wife Tracey is godparent to his daughter Lauren. \"We're still talking,\" smiles Dickov, who has whiled away many a happy hour watching the match video. Should he be City's hero yet again today, he might just be offered the Freedom of Moss Side.",

In July, a retired civil servant in Wales was reported to have been shot dead after arguing with a neighbour over a boundary dispute and a hedge dividing their gardens. </p> <p>Campaigning group Hedgeline has lobbied the government for almost three years for legislation to control the height and spread of Leylandii and other monster trees and hedges. At the forefront of the campaign is founder Michael Jones, from Birmingham, whose problem began 20 years ago and whose case has cost thousands of pounds in court fees. It even led judges to struggle with the definition of a hedge. </p> <p>Hedgeline president Clare Hinchliffe is boxed in by hedging including Leyland and Laurel varieties. She is negotiating with her neighbours to keep the hedges trimmed. The main hedge culprit is as loathed by its victims as any criminal - the Leyland Cypress (Cupressocyparis leylandii). The plant, the result of a chance cross of two other varieties of Cypress in 1888, is the most widely used conifer for hedging and screening. The reason behind its popularity is its vigour. It grows at a rate of four feet a year and withstands windswept conditions. It is a very useful plant in the right environment. However, the speed of its growth and it height (up to 100ft) has also attracted homeowners searching for an instant barrier to screen their garden from their neighbours. Before long, the hedges are out of control. </p> <p>Unchecked, the trees can suck the life-blood out of nearby flowerbeds and shrubs as well as damage buildings and fences. As Ms Hinchliffe points out: \"Seven foot of nuisance hedge can cut out the light completely in a small garden\". </p> <p>Unruly hedges are also expensive to maintain and can make a property difficult to sell. The stress of dealing with a neighbour's monster hedge takes its toll on homeowners mental health, she says. \"We want a law whereby nuisance hedging can be identified by some means and growers can be forced to reduce it in height\" Ms Hinchliffe says. </p> <p>At present the power lies with the person who grows the hedge. The only rights neighbours have is to cut off overhanging branches. </p> <p>The government has acknowledged the need for new laws to keep the problem in check following a public consultation last year. In August environment minister Michael Meacher announced that, when legislative time allowed, local authorities in England would be given new powers to settle hedge disputes if the matter could not be solved amicably. It is up to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to introduce their own legislative changes. </p> <p> The problems faced by mandarins at the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) charged with drafting new rules is defining what constitutes a \"nuisance\". Hedgeline recognises the problems of definition and is anxious that any new laws do not follow in the steps of the Dangerous Dogs Act. Above all, says Ms Hinchliffe, new laws need to be workable. </p> <p>Among Hedgeline's 3,000 members, there are those who have had their lives ruined, lost thousands of pounds and almost their sanity in disputes over hedges. So what drives homeowners to dig their heels in and refuse to trim a nuisance hedge. Ms Hinchliffe says usually the disputes build up gradually. </p> <p>\"It starts off civilly with a victim asking their neighbour to trim the hedge. They'll cut it a bit, but before long it will grow again. The victim will have to go round again and again to ask them to cut it further. Before long the relationship between the neighbours will have deteriorated.\" </p> <p>She also believes it is no coincidence that many Hedgeline members are elderly widows who having lost their husbands and are too worn out from grief to tackle bullying neighbours. Perhaps people who grow high hedges take more care when their neighbours are younger and more able to fight their corner, she says. </p> <p>People see it as their right to grow a hedge and the law is on their side at the moment. \"So if it's causing you a problem you have to screw on a smile and ask nicely.\" </p> <p>Hegdeline advises people, no matter how great the temptation, not to take an axe to the offending growth. The organisation also urges victims to stay away from courts and solicitors unless absolutely necessary. When disputes escalate and lawyers are involved, victims rarely end up any better off - the law is on the side of the hedge grower, says the organisation. </p> <p>The DETR publishes advice on how to choose a hedge, called The Right Hedge for You. The pamphlet reminds householders that all hedges need trimming at least once a year, some need to be cut more often. Growers should also resist the temptation to plant a fast growing variety because it will continue to grow after it's reached the desired height. Keeping it in check thereafter could be costly and time consuming.</p>",

Before long the relationship between the neighbours will have deteriorated.\" She also believes it is no coincidence that many Hedgeline members are elderly widows who having lost their husbands and are too worn out from grief to tackle bullying neighbours. Perhaps people who grow high hedges take more care when their neighbours are younger and more able to fight their corner, she says. People see it as their right to grow a hedge and the law is on their side at the moment. \"So if it's causing you a problem you have to screw on a smile and ask nicely.\" Hegdeline advises people, no matter how great the temptation, not to take an axe to the offending growth. The organisation also urges victims to stay away from courts and solicitors unless absolutely necessary. When disputes escalate and lawyers are involved, victims rarely end up any better off - the law is on the side of the hedge grower, says the organisation. The DETR publishes advice on how to choose a hedge, called The Right Hedge for You. The pamphlet reminds householders that all hedges need trimming at least once a year, some need to be cut more often. Growers should also resist the temptation to plant a fast growing variety because it will continue to grow after it's reached the desired height. Keeping it in check thereafter could be costly and time consuming.",

      "body": "<p>This week the rumbustious columnist Jeremy Clarkson wrote in the Sunday Times about the BBC. \"On Wednesday night, I went to a throughly enjoyable dinner, hosted by the head of factual documentaries at the BBC, who is a woman,\" he starts. </p> <p>\"Also in attendance were her two deputies, who are women, the head of daytime television, who is a woman, the new controller of BBC1, who is a woman, the woman in charge of regionally made television and Ray Mears.\" </p> <p>He goes on to list many of the women who hold senior positions in the Beeb in his usual bloke-ish fashion. The addition of an acerbic, bitter ending to his story is missing, however, because he concludes that women are just as capable as men at doing these high-powered jobs and good luck to them. Thanks Jezzer. </p> <p>Yet the BBC, with its positive policies towards childcare, flexible working and the long-term career prospects of women, remains an anomaly in the business world rather than the foretaste of female power Clarkson seems to hint at. </p> <p>Women still face huge levels of sexism in the workplace. Last week the Industrial Society urged big businesses to stop living in the past when it reported that just 5% of directors of FTSE 100 companies are female. Most in need of a shake-up is Standard Chartered Bank, which has a board of 17, all of whom are male. </p> <p>There is plenty of other evidence: the New Earnings Survey just pub lished by the Equal Opportunities Commission shows that at this rate it will be 20 years until the gap between men and women's earnings is closed. Women who work full time are still earning on average \u00a38.98 an hour, compared with \u00a311 for men.

      "bodyText": "This week the rumbustious columnist Jeremy Clarkson wrote in the Sunday Times about the BBC. \"On Wednesday night, I went to a throughly enjoyable dinner, hosted by the head of factual documentaries at the BBC, who is a woman,\" he starts. \"Also in attendance were her two deputies, who are women, the head of daytime television, who is a woman, the new controller of BBC1, who is a woman, the woman in charge of regionally made television and Ray Mears.\" He goes on to list many of the women who hold senior positions in the Beeb in his usual bloke-ish fashion. The addition of an acerbic, bitter ending to his story is missing, however, because he concludes that women are just as capable as men at doing these high-powered jobs and good luck to them. Thanks Jezzer. Yet the BBC, with its positive policies towards childcare, flexible working and the long-term career prospects of women, remains an anomaly in the business world rather than the foretaste of female power Clarkson seems to hint at. Women still face huge levels of sexism in the workplace. Last week the Industrial Society urged big businesses to stop living in the past when it reported that just 5% of directors of FTSE 100 companies are female. Most in need of a shake-up is Standard Chartered Bank, which has a board of 17, all of whom are male. There is plenty of other evidence: the New Earnings Survey just pub lished by the Equal Opportunities Commission shows that at this rate it will be 20 years until the gap between men and women's earnings is closed. Women who work full time are still earning on average \u00a38.98 an hour, compared with \u00a311 for men. In Scotland the situation is more acute: average hourly wages for women are around 22% less than men's. Also last month, the Institute of Management released its National Management Salary Survey 2000.

The price the members who sell immediately receive will be determined by the demand among institutional investors at the special City auction on December 3-4, and they are unlikely to bid aggressively for the shares because B&amp;B will not be big enough to enter the FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest companies. </p> <p>As a result Mr Hodges believes the shares may not open particularly strongly - perhaps at around 250p-260p each - but ultimately he thinks the business fundamentals and B&amp;B's plans to become the leading independent distributor of financial and property services will make it an attractive stock. \"I think ultimately they are worth somewhat more than that - certainly 300p and possibly up to 320p. It's a wait and see as opposed to a sell and regret later.\" </p> <p><strong> Fred Robinson at stockbroker Killik &amp; Co</strong> indicates that for those people who aren't seasoned investors with already-established share portfolios, selling may be the best option, but he also advises people to think about the timing of when they sell. </p> <p>He believes the combination of two factors - the large number of carpetbaggers receiving windfalls and the nearness to Christmas - mean a lot of people will choose to sell immediately and take the money, and there is therefore an argument for hanging on in the hope that the share price will improve once this initial batch of shares have been snapped up. But you have to ask yourself how long are you prepared to wait to see an improvement, and you also have to consider what your selling costs will be (while there's a \u00a310 fee for selling immediately, it will probably cost you more than this to sell at a later date). </p> <p>All things considered, if you're a novice investor with no other shares, holding those of just one company probably isn't a good idea, and you should perhaps consider selling. And if you're a carpetbagger it's pretty simple - you should take the money and run, he adds. </p> <p><strong>Barclays</strong></p> <p>The takeover of Woolwich by Barclays was officially completed on October 25, and 1.2m Woolwich shareholders received their new share certificates and cash last week. </p> <p>Under the terms of the deal these people received \u00a31.64 in cash and 0.1175 of a Barclays share for each Woolwich share they held. </p> <p>Someone who held 657 Woolwich shares (the average windfall payout back in 1997) would have received a cheque for \u00a31,081.23 plus 77 Barclays shares, which this week were worth around \u00a319.40 each - well up on this summer, when the share price dipped below \u00a315. </p> <p>Someone who had 450 Woolwich shares (the basic allocation) would have received a cheque for \u00a3754.63 and 52 Barclays shares. </p> <p>However, there was a mix and match option allowing people to opt for more cash or more shares if they wish.

      "body": "<p>It is rare on a British stage to find a play dealing with contemporary Europe. But this work by Matei Visniec, the exiled Romanian writer, is an impassioned two-hander that encompasses the Bosnian war, victimised women, Balkan man and the Freudian nature of resurgent nationalism. Even if you can sense Visniec ticking off his list of chosen topics, you emerge both intellectually informed and emotionally moved. </p> <p>The setting of The Body of a Woman as as Battlefield in the Bosnian War is a Nato medical facility on the German border where two women come together in the aftermath of the war. </p> <p>Dorra, from the former Yuogoslavia, is suffering traumatic neurosis as a result of rape. Kate, a 35-year-old Bostonian who has been working as team pyschologist to a mass-graves commission, is also suffering a nervous crisis. </p> <p>At first Dorra is deeply suspicious of Kate, imagining she wants to subject her to clinical enquiry. But the two women are drawn together by post-war stress and offer each other healing support. It is only when Kate seeks to adopt Dorra's expected baby that we are reminded of the gulf between American guilt and European experience. </p> <p>Visniec covers a vast amount of ground in his 105-minute play. In one scene the two women get drunk and play tapes of European music while Dorra catalogues the vices and virtues of all the respective nationalities. </p> <p>It may be highly contrived but, as female drunk-scenes go, it is 10 times more interesting than the acrobatic display of inebriation in Coward's Fallen Angels. </p> <p>Visniec's central idea, however, is the one contained in his title: that, in the Balkans, rape is a form of military strategy and that resurgent nationalism is often a form of infantile sadism. Given the horror-stories that came out of Bosnia, it is a perfectly tenable thesis. My only cavil is that Visniec announces it journalistically and then proceeds to illustrate it dramatically. </p> <p>But Alison Sinclair, who has directed and translated the play for Reality Productions, engages you with the plight of these two women and turns then into something more than symbolic victims. </p> <p>Sladjana Vujovic as Dorra beautifully charts the conflict between physical revulsion at carrying a child of war and the growth of a defiant maternalism. And Gina Landor, through alertly expressive features, captures the American observer's harrowed identification with European female suffering. </p> <p>It starts as a thesis-play but it ends by showing theatre's rare capacity to give emotional reality to reported fact. </p> <p>\u0095 Until December 2.

      "bodyText": "It is rare on a British stage to find a play dealing with contemporary Europe. But this work by Matei Visniec, the exiled Romanian writer, is an impassioned two-hander that encompasses the Bosnian war, victimised women, Balkan man and the Freudian nature of resurgent nationalism. Even if you can sense Visniec ticking off his list of chosen topics, you emerge both intellectually informed and emotionally moved. The setting of The Body of a Woman as as Battlefield in the Bosnian War is a Nato medical facility on the German border where two women come together in the aftermath of the war. Dorra, from the former Yuogoslavia, is suffering traumatic neurosis as a result of rape. Kate, a 35-year-old Bostonian who has been working as team pyschologist to a mass-graves commission, is also suffering a nervous crisis. At first Dorra is deeply suspicious of Kate, imagining she wants to subject her to clinical enquiry. But the two women are drawn together by post-war stress and offer each other healing support. It is only when Kate seeks to adopt Dorra's expected baby that we are reminded of the gulf between American guilt and European experience. Visniec covers a vast amount of ground in his 105-minute play. In one scene the two women get drunk and play tapes of European music while Dorra catalogues the vices and virtues of all the respective nationalities. It may be highly contrived but, as female drunk-scenes go, it is 10 times more interesting than the acrobatic display of inebriation in Coward's Fallen Angels. Visniec's central idea, however, is the one contained in his title: that, in the Balkans, rape is a form of military strategy and that resurgent nationalism is often a form of infantile sadism. Given the horror-stories that came out of Bosnia, it is a perfectly tenable thesis. My only cavil is that Visniec announces it journalistically and then proceeds to illustrate it dramatically. But Alison Sinclair, who has directed and translated the play for Reality Productions, engages you with the plight of these two women and turns then into something more than symbolic victims. Sladjana Vujovic as Dorra beautifully charts the conflict between physical revulsion at carrying a child of war and the growth of a defiant maternalism. And Gina Landor, through alertly expressive features, captures the American observer's harrowed identification with European female suffering. It starts as a thesis-play but it ends by showing theatre's rare capacity to give emotional reality to reported fact. \u0095 Until December 2. Box office: 020-7928 6363",

      "body": "<p>I spend most weekends in Lewes, East Sussex, a town severely hit by flooding during the recent storms. Although I live on a hill I am not immune to storm damage. But it was after I went to the bottom of town and saw the sodden stores - some of them antique shops - that I got to wondering about insurance. </p> <p>There has been a crop of newspaper stories saying what the storms are likely to cost and that insurance companies do not like paying up. But it is the difficulties attending \"contents policies\" which really made what is left of my hair stand on end. It is not that I own a bunch of Picassos or anything. But I do have some old books which have personal and some material value, and these are covered by my personal contents policy. </p> <p>An insurance broker friend tried to explain some of the problems waiting to ambush me. First, insurers do not like providing large overall contents cover. You can specify particular items, like my books, for \u00a310,000, but once you get beyond an overall total of \u00a350,000 they begin whacking on the premiums. </p> <p>Secondly, most people forget to update their policies so the insurance companies refuse to pay for any appreciation. Say I bought an LS Lowry painting 10 years ago for \u00a32,000, and it is now worth \u00a310,000, it would be the devil's own job getting the insurance company to cough up the ten grand. </p> <p>Thirdly, the companies want to replace like with like. If, for example, my CD collection was washed away, I might have to itemise each title so that the company could replace them. </p> <p>For collectors, even of low-value items, a specialised insurer is the best option. </p> <p>Axa Nordstern Art Insurance now reckons to be the world's leading high net-worth insurance company specialising in art and antiques. Clare Pardy, the chief client manager, reckons that it can be as cheap if not cheaper to insure art and antiques through a specialised company than through the composites.

      "bodyText": "I spend most weekends in Lewes, East Sussex, a town severely hit by flooding during the recent storms. Although I live on a hill I am not immune to storm damage. But it was after I went to the bottom of town and saw the sodden stores - some of them antique shops - that I got to wondering about insurance. There has been a crop of newspaper stories saying what the storms are likely to cost and that insurance companies do not like paying up. But it is the difficulties attending \"contents policies\" which really made what is left of my hair stand on end. It is not that I own a bunch of Picassos or anything. But I do have some old books which have personal and some material value, and these are covered by my personal contents policy. An insurance broker friend tried to explain some of the problems waiting to ambush me. First, insurers do not like providing large overall contents cover. You can specify particular items, like my books, for \u00a310,000, but once you get beyond an overall total of \u00a350,000 they begin whacking on the premiums. Secondly, most people forget to update their policies so the insurance companies refuse to pay for any appreciation. Say I bought an LS Lowry painting 10 years ago for \u00a32,000, and it is now worth \u00a310,000, it would be the devil's own job getting the insurance company to cough up the ten grand. Thirdly, the companies want to replace like with like. If, for example, my CD collection was washed away, I might have to itemise each title so that the company could replace them. For collectors, even of low-value items, a specialised insurer is the best option. Axa Nordstern Art Insurance now reckons to be the world's leading high net-worth insurance company specialising in art and antiques. Clare Pardy, the chief client manager, reckons that it can be as cheap if not cheaper to insure art and antiques through a specialised company than through the composites. Nordstern, which estimates it covers 30% of British Antique Dealers Association (Bada) members, starts its charges 0.20%. The minimum is \u00a3500, which will get you cover of \u00a3150,000. Nordstern's experts agree on valuation and assess the risk before the insurance is taken out and not afterwards.
