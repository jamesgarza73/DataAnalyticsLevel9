For Dave Beasant though, as long as the body's willing so is he - and besides he's having far too much fun to pack it in just yet. </p> <p>Beasant travels with Nottingham Forest to Chelsea tonight in the FA Cup fourth round and the route is a familiar one to the goalkeeper who has regularly returned to Stamford Bridge, the scene of some of his most glorious, and humiliating, moments since his turbulent playing spell there ended in 1993. </p> <p>Sons Nick, 14, and Sam, 11, attend Chelsea's academy, and Beasant, who still lives in Buckinghamshire, trains with the first-team goalkeeping coach Eddie Niedzwiecki whenever possible. It is a close relationship which has restored Beasant's respect for the club who almost ended his career. </p> <p>\"The club has changed enormously since I was there and that's the disappointing thing,\" he says. \"I would have liked to have been at Chelsea during the transitional period where it has gone from being a big clubby name, living on what had happened during the 70s, to an incredibly professionally run club which has had huge amounts of money pumped into it.\" </p> <p>Oh for such a transformation at Forest. David Platt's side have struggled since they dropped out of the Premiership last year and currently lie 18th in the First Division; they were leapfrogged by Grimsby on Saturday after a 4-3 defeat at Blundell Park during which Beasant was sent off. The FA Cup is their last target of the season, other than staving off a further relegation. </p> <p>\"I don't think the players at the club realised how negative the effect of relegation would be,\" Beasant explains. \"I think everyone thought that we were going to go straight back up, but suddenly it wasn't clicking together and we couldn't put our finger on what was happening. We were lacking confidence and couldn't put a run together. Lately we've had a more settled team and have raised our game against the better teams.\" </p> <p>Forest must do that to stand a chance tonight, and Beasant will have an extra incentive to prove himself in front of the Stamford Bridge crowd. After a successful start to his Chelsea career, events took a dramatic turn for the worse when, without his knowledge, Chelsea's then manager Ian Porterfield effectively gave him the sack after a match against Norwich on September 12 1992 when the goalkeeper had made two dreadful errors to cost his side the game. </p> <p>\"I'd had a stinker,\" he continues, \"and I went into the dressing room and apologised to the lads. The manager said nothing to me; I had a bath and went home. Then I was sitting watching the television later that night and the Nine O'Clock News came on. It went through the headlines and then it said, 'And in sport, Dave Beasant has been sacked from Chelsea.' I was stunned.\" </p> <p>Beasant recovered from this most public of executions to rebuild his career at Southampton before moving to the City Ground in August 1997.

      "bodyText": "When you have played in four different decades, you are in your 41st year and your sons are learning the trade at which you have excelled, retirement and relaxation would seem the obvious career move. For Dave Beasant though, as long as the body's willing so is he - and besides he's having far too much fun to pack it in just yet. Beasant travels with Nottingham Forest to Chelsea tonight in the FA Cup fourth round and the route is a familiar one to the goalkeeper who has regularly returned to Stamford Bridge, the scene of some of his most glorious, and humiliating, moments since his turbulent playing spell there ended in 1993. Sons Nick, 14, and Sam, 11, attend Chelsea's academy, and Beasant, who still lives in Buckinghamshire, trains with the first-team goalkeeping coach Eddie Niedzwiecki whenever possible. It is a close relationship which has restored Beasant's respect for the club who almost ended his career. \"The club has changed enormously since I was there and that's the disappointing thing,\" he says. \"I would have liked to have been at Chelsea during the transitional period where it has gone from being a big clubby name, living on what had happened during the 70s, to an incredibly professionally run club which has had huge amounts of money pumped into it.\" Oh for such a transformation at Forest. David Platt's side have struggled since they dropped out of the Premiership last year and currently lie 18th in the First Division; they were leapfrogged by Grimsby on Saturday after a 4-3 defeat at Blundell Park during which Beasant was sent off. The FA Cup is their last target of the season, other than staving off a further relegation. \"I don't think the players at the club realised how negative the effect of relegation would be,\" Beasant explains. \"I think everyone thought that we were going to go straight back up, but suddenly it wasn't clicking together and we couldn't put our finger on what was happening.

      "standfirst": "Mr Blair's pledge on NHS spending is an unbreakable commitment",
      "trailText": "<p>Tony Blair's commitment to massively increase the NHS budget is not a step change but a revolution in NHS policy, says Polly Toynbee.</p>",
      "byline": "Polly Toynbee",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This is not another old sticking plaster. This is something never seen before. It is the first commitment ever to give the health service what it needs and deserves. Just as Tony Blair astounded his critics last year with his pledge to abolish child poverty, so he has knocked the wind out of every health critic with his pledge on NHS spending. Gobsmacked, said one. The BMA is demanding a precise interpretation of Blair's words, but even the lowest figure suggests a real increase of one quarter more. That's not a step-change, it's a revolution - and no amount of finessing the fine print will ever let Labour off: they must now hit EU average health spending in five years. </p> <p>Ever since Attlee savagely cut Aneurin Bevan's money to launch the service, the NHS started out on the back foot. Bevan even promised NHS needs would shrink as the backlog of ill-health was cured. But soaring costs and demands kept the service struggling to keep up with an ageing population, new technology and now a new generation of drugs. Despite above inflation money every year, it hasn't had enough to show visible, tangible improvement, to prove what good value voters get for the low taxes they pay. </p> <p>How sick is the NHS? Nothing like as bad as the past two weeks' news would have you believe. It is difficult to take the pulse of this huge, patchy beast, but almost any measure shows continuous improvement, treating more people more reliably with more transparent medical results. Tory health reforms improved accountability, while their patients' charter cut waiting times and made the NHS more consumer-aware. Labour has improved on the best elements of these. Best of all, the new National Institute of Clinical Effectiveness is screening drugs and treatments to spread the most effective practice evenly across the NHS. League tables now help weed out black spots where treatments fall below average. </p> <p>But all this underlying improvement was too slow and too invisible. The NHS never kept up with public demand. Low tax decades left it trailing behind private affluence, shabby and slow compared with a trip to Ikea or Disneyland. That is why Tony Blair rightly demands the best in those things patients notice most - booked appointments, walk-in GP services, NHS Direct and refurbished A and E departments with no waits and no trolleys. Misled by most of what they read, or by scary documentaries empty of analysis (BBC just as guilty), how is the public to know how good or bad the NHS really is? </p> <p>There will never be a time under any system in the world where health does not provide journalists with plentiful horror stories, true or false. Interestingly, the polls show how the most fit who rarely use the NHS rate it lowest, while frequent users rate it highest: rumour is stronger than reality. </p> <p>The anatomy of an NHS panic is a curious thing. As a veteran of many outbreaks, this is how they work: they start in the post-new year news vacuum, coinciding with the annual \"flu crisis\" - usually an artifact, also conveniently close to the end of the financial year when traditionally hospitals used ostentatiously to close down wards to protest about running out of money. This time, on January 7, it was the man in Hereford shunted round several hospitals who died 24 hours later. His outspoken surgeon protested publicly and sent up the news flares. Never mind that it later turned out to be human error and not NHS shortage (the ambulance failed to take him to the nearest hospital where a bed was waiting for him). </p> <p>Certainly the woman who had her operation cancelled four times was monstrously treated (yet experts murmur under their breath that her cancer was almost certainly non-survivable anyway). Never mind the subtleties, these cases fly like the wind. The timely words of Lord Winston gave added kick to the usual cacophony of NHS winter shroud waving (though an IVF specialist may not really know about winter crises among the old). </p> <p>However these regular outbursts of NHS embarrassment for the government of the day don't take root or force government action unless there is an element of truth in them. In 1987, when deaths at a Birmingham heart hospital sparked a furore, the NHS was indeed in genuine trouble. John Moore's disastrous cuts had lead the heads of the mighty royal colleges to call on Downing Street in a formidable delegation. That led to the great Tory reforms - and more money. So now, again, Labour's two-year financial squeeze, though far less severe, lends a dose of truth to the partly fanciful reporting of the present state of the NHS. </p> <p>There were plenty who warned Labour back in 1997 that a two-year freeze would inevitably lead to a public explosion. NHS staff are under intolerable pressure from too many years of forcing them to work harder through \"productivity\" cuts: they easily can and do walk with their feet to get better paid jobs elsewhere. Most doctors work very long, hard hours, with many committees and much paperwork. Beds are too full all year round, so any slight crisis means trolleys in corridors. If patients have to wait a week to see GPs, we need more doctors. Some services, like mental health, have always been calamitously underfunded. </p> <p>What now? Not all NHS problems spring from lack of money - but money will make all the difference. There may be enough beds, but many are blocked with old people for lack of good (and far cheaper) nursing home beds or care at home. Better community care will matter as much as better hospitals. Will managers make sure doctors cut waiting lists, when private practice is such an incentive to keep them long? The unions need to be fought on local pay rates: it does cost more to hire a nurse in London than in Blackburn. The unions need to be listened to on conditions and hours to make NHS careers flexible, attractive and progressive. </p> <p>But the main lesson of this last scare - and why Tony Blair was right to intervene so dramatically - is that the NHS has new and more ferocious enemies barking at its door. The private health lobbies and many in their pay are among them.

      "bodyText": "This is not another old sticking plaster. This is something never seen before. It is the first commitment ever to give the health service what it needs and deserves. Just as Tony Blair astounded his critics last year with his pledge to abolish child poverty, so he has knocked the wind out of every health critic with his pledge on NHS spending. Gobsmacked, said one. The BMA is demanding a precise interpretation of Blair's words, but even the lowest figure suggests a real increase of one quarter more. That's not a step-change, it's a revolution - and no amount of finessing the fine print will ever let Labour off: they must now hit EU average health spending in five years. Ever since Attlee savagely cut Aneurin Bevan's money to launch the service, the NHS started out on the back foot. Bevan even promised NHS needs would shrink as the backlog of ill-health was cured. But soaring costs and demands kept the service struggling to keep up with an ageing population, new technology and now a new generation of drugs. Despite above inflation money every year, it hasn't had enough to show visible, tangible improvement, to prove what good value voters get for the low taxes they pay. How sick is the NHS? Nothing like as bad as the past two weeks' news would have you believe. It is difficult to take the pulse of this huge, patchy beast, but almost any measure shows continuous improvement, treating more people more reliably with more transparent medical results. Tory health reforms improved accountability, while their patients' charter cut waiting times and made the NHS more consumer-aware. Labour has improved on the best elements of these. Best of all, the new National Institute of Clinical Effectiveness is screening drugs and treatments to spread the most effective practice evenly across the NHS. League tables now help weed out black spots where treatments fall below average. But all this underlying improvement was too slow and too invisible. The NHS never kept up with public demand. Low tax decades left it trailing behind private affluence, shabby and slow compared with a trip to Ikea or Disneyland. That is why Tony Blair rightly demands the best in those things patients notice most - booked appointments, walk-in GP services, NHS Direct and refurbished A and E departments with no waits and no trolleys. Misled by most of what they read, or by scary documentaries empty of analysis (BBC just as guilty), how is the public to know how good or bad the NHS really is? There will never be a time under any system in the world where health does not provide journalists with plentiful horror stories, true or false. Interestingly, the polls show how the most fit who rarely use the NHS rate it lowest, while frequent users rate it highest: rumour is stronger than reality. The anatomy of an NHS panic is a curious thing. As a veteran of many outbreaks, this is how they work: they start in the post-new year news vacuum, coinciding with the annual \"flu crisis\" - usually an artifact, also conveniently close to the end of the financial year when traditionally hospitals used ostentatiously to close down wards to protest about running out of money. This time, on January 7, it was the man in Hereford shunted round several hospitals who died 24 hours later. His outspoken surgeon protested publicly and sent up the news flares. Never mind that it later turned out to be human error and not NHS shortage (the ambulance failed to take him to the nearest hospital where a bed was waiting for him). Certainly the woman who had her operation cancelled four times was monstrously treated (yet experts murmur under their breath that her cancer was almost certainly non-survivable anyway). Never mind the subtleties, these cases fly like the wind. The timely words of Lord Winston gave added kick to the usual cacophony of NHS winter shroud waving (though an IVF specialist may not really know about winter crises among the old). However these regular outbursts of NHS embarrassment for the government of the day don't take root or force government action unless there is an element of truth in them. In 1987, when deaths at a Birmingham heart hospital sparked a furore, the NHS was indeed in genuine trouble. John Moore's disastrous cuts had lead the heads of the mighty royal colleges to call on Downing Street in a formidable delegation. That led to the great Tory reforms - and more money. So now, again, Labour's two-year financial squeeze, though far less severe, lends a dose of truth to the partly fanciful reporting of the present state of the NHS. There were plenty who warned Labour back in 1997 that a two-year freeze would inevitably lead to a public explosion. NHS staff are under intolerable pressure from too many years of forcing them to work harder through \"productivity\" cuts: they easily can and do walk with their feet to get better paid jobs elsewhere. Most doctors work very long, hard hours, with many committees and much paperwork. Beds are too full all year round, so any slight crisis means trolleys in corridors. If patients have to wait a week to see GPs, we need more doctors. Some services, like mental health, have always been calamitously underfunded. What now? Not all NHS problems spring from lack of money - but money will make all the difference. There may be enough beds, but many are blocked with old people for lack of good (and far cheaper) nursing home beds or care at home. Better community care will matter as much as better hospitals. Will managers make sure doctors cut waiting lists, when private practice is such an incentive to keep them long? The unions need to be fought on local pay rates: it does cost more to hire a nurse in London than in Blackburn. The unions need to be listened to on conditions and hours to make NHS careers flexible, attractive and progressive. But the main lesson of this last scare - and why Tony Blair was right to intervene so dramatically - is that the NHS has new and more ferocious enemies barking at its door. The private health lobbies and many in their pay are among them. It was essential that Tony Blair should send the whole Tory press, with their scares and campaigns about \"Britain's third world wards\" creeping away with their tails between their legs. There never was any problem about the NHS funding mechanism. All it required was the political will. The NHS, for all its miserly frugality, is rated the best value for money in the world. Paying for it out of general taxation is the most economical, fair and least bureaucratic way. All it needed was a lot more money, which it now has. Labour cannot backslide on this, whatever the future economic circumstances, whatever its equally strong promises on poverty, education and transport. And it might take raising more tax.",

      "body": "<p>Tony Banks, the former sports minister, yesterday vigorously defended himself against accusations that he was to blame for the fiasco over the new National Stadium at Wembley. </p> <p>Giving evidence before a Commons select committee, he hit back at claims by Jarvis Astaire, the former deputy chairman of Wembley plc, that he wanted to destroy the \u00a3475m project by deliberately keeping athletics out. </p> <p>\"It's a lie, a straightforward lie,\" said Banks. \"If I were to have that agenda it would make me a liar in front of the House. I made it quite clear that a national stadium should be capable of staging football, rugby league and athletics.\" </p> <p>Banks was the sports minister between July 1997 and July 1999 and oversaw the critical phase of the project. When he stepped down to become the government's special ambassador for the England 2006 World Cup bid and was replaced by Kate Hoey the proposal collapsed amid doubts whether Wembley could stage the Olympic Games. </p> <p>The culture secretary Chris Smith sent the plans back to the drawing board before scrapping them last month and announcing that Wembley would stage only football and rugby league. Athletics is searching for an alternative venue capable of hosting the 2005 world championships. </p> <p>As a result of Smith's decision the Football Association has to return \u00a320m of the \u00a3120m it received in national lottery funding. But Banks said that when he left he believed everything was on track. \"I was convinced we had a done deal,\" he said. \"I remain convinced that deal was OK.\" </p> <p>Banks admitted that Smith had expressed concern over plans to install a temporary track. \"We had a meeting with the designers and he reluctantly accepted that the platform was the one to go forward with,\" he said. </p> <p>The project was radically altered after Hoey took office, and Banks believes he has been made a scapegoat by the media. He remains committed to the original plan. \"There have been a lot of people working very hard to poke a sharp stick in my eye,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But as a humble minister I could see no reason why the compromise which the architects came up with did not work. It was a stunning design and the solution for staging athletics was novel.\" </p> <p>Banks, a friend of Ken Bates, the chairman of Wembley National Stadium Ltd, said he believed football had fulfilled its contract by coming up with a workable plan for a multi-purpose arena and should not have to return any money. </p> <p>\"Football could, in my opinion, say we've done this in good faith, we are not going to give any money back; why should we, what have we done wrong? I think it's a very generous offer football is making.\" </p> <p>The committee, which is due to report next month, also heard evidence from David Moorcroft and Simon Clegg, chief executives of UK Athletics and the British Olympic Association respectively. </p> <p>Banks made it clear that he believed the project would have gone through if the BOA had not tried to gain a greater input into the project after his departure. \"I spoke to Simon and told him, 'Hang on to what you've got for you might end up with nothing'. </p> <p>\"I was concerned that athletics was going to be the loser in this situation. As one of the ministers responsible for the National Stadium it is a matter of great disappointment to me that athletics won't be there.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Banks, the former sports minister, yesterday vigorously defended himself against accusations that he was to blame for the fiasco over the new National Stadium at Wembley. Giving evidence before a Commons select committee, he hit back at claims by Jarvis Astaire, the former deputy chairman of Wembley plc, that he wanted to destroy the \u00a3475m project by deliberately keeping athletics out. \"It's a lie, a straightforward lie,\" said Banks. \"If I were to have that agenda it would make me a liar in front of the House. I made it quite clear that a national stadium should be capable of staging football, rugby league and athletics.\" Banks was the sports minister between July 1997 and July 1999 and oversaw the critical phase of the project. When he stepped down to become the government's special ambassador for the England 2006 World Cup bid and was replaced by Kate Hoey the proposal collapsed amid doubts whether Wembley could stage the Olympic Games. The culture secretary Chris Smith sent the plans back to the drawing board before scrapping them last month and announcing that Wembley would stage only football and rugby league. Athletics is searching for an alternative venue capable of hosting the 2005 world championships. As a result of Smith's decision the Football Association has to return \u00a320m of the \u00a3120m it received in national lottery funding. But Banks said that when he left he believed everything was on track. \"I was convinced we had a done deal,\" he said. \"I remain convinced that deal was OK.\" Banks admitted that Smith had expressed concern over plans to install a temporary track. \"We had a meeting with the designers and he reluctantly accepted that the platform was the one to go forward with,\" he said. The project was radically altered after Hoey took office, and Banks believes he has been made a scapegoat by the media. He remains committed to the original plan. \"There have been a lot of people working very hard to poke a sharp stick in my eye,\" he said. \"But as a humble minister I could see no reason why the compromise which the architects came up with did not work. It was a stunning design and the solution for staging athletics was novel.\" Banks, a friend of Ken Bates, the chairman of Wembley National Stadium Ltd, said he believed football had fulfilled its contract by coming up with a workable plan for a multi-purpose arena and should not have to return any money. \"Football could, in my opinion, say we've done this in good faith, we are not going to give any money back; why should we, what have we done wrong? I think it's a very generous offer football is making.\" The committee, which is due to report next month, also heard evidence from David Moorcroft and Simon Clegg, chief executives of UK Athletics and the British Olympic Association respectively. Banks made it clear that he believed the project would have gone through if the BOA had not tried to gain a greater input into the project after his departure. \"I spoke to Simon and told him, 'Hang on to what you've got for you might end up with nothing'. \"I was concerned that athletics was going to be the loser in this situation. As one of the ministers responsible for the National Stadium it is a matter of great disappointment to me that athletics won't be there.\"",

      "body": "<p>Hollywood is buzzing, as only Hollywood can buzz, with the news that Harrison Ford has changed agents, and is now signed up with United Talent Agency, marking his first relationship with a major agency in 15 years. The increasingly craggy star, who has recently accepted the People's Choice award for favourite movie actor, has long been represented exclusively by his manager Patricia McQueeney. But although he may be the People's Choice, Ford's own choice of movies recently - Random Hearts, Six Days, Seven Nights - has not exactly set his accountant doing somersaults.</p> <p>As McQueeney explains it, Ford realised that he needs better access to both hotter scripts and hipper film-makers. In other words, to lengthen his career span he needs to be more aware of those career-enhancing indie flicks that other megastars occasionally shoehorn into their saving-the-world itineraries (think Tom Cruise in Magnolia). Ford's decision triggered a predictable scramble among the top Hollywood agents to land him. </p> <p>However, this feeding frenzy has come at a time when the whole concept of agenting in Hollywood is changing rapidly.</p> <p>The distinction between agents and managers is a subtle but crucial one. Both cater to the whims of their 'talent', but under Californian law, agents must be licensed, and are prohibited from producing films. Managers, on the other hand, can produce, but are barred from negotiating contracts. So one hand washes the other. Agents (whose traditional job has been to seek out and negotiate deals for their clients) can collect no more than 10% of a star's fee. Managers (whose traditional role is to strategise an actor's career moves) routinely charge 15% or more.</p> <p>Hollywood's proto-agent was Lew Wasserman. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and partner of Jules Stein, Wasserman founded the original MCA, a talent-booking agency which by the 1930s had effectively wiped out its rivals. Jules Stein was an old-fashioned agent with manners to match. He once famously turned away from his door a casually dressed Cary Grant who was his most important client at that time: \"No dinner jacket, no dinner.\" </p> <p>Wasserman, on the other hand, was more likely to negotiate the shirt off somebody's back. As an agent, Wasserman was the first to secure a million-dollar deal for an actor - Ronald Reagan, no less. He even forced studio heads to renegotiate contracts even after all parties had signed. </p> <p>MCA's impact is hard to understate. MGM head Louis B. Mayer held the company directly responsible for the erosion of the studios' control. Wasserman would persuade actors to buy out their existing studio contracts and sign with him. He then sold those new clients back to the same studios for inflated fees that quickly repaid the buyout, and which executives found themselves powerless to refuse. After all, the public demands its stars.</p> <p>For Wasserman, it was a question of supply and demand. Create a sellers' market, control the commodity supply, cream off that 10%. Eventually, MCA realised that it could boost income from its less popular talent if it refused to let its A-list actors work without B-list support. Thus a lowly director on MCA's books might come as part and parcel of a deal that secured an A-list star.</p> <p>Stories about brutal agents have long been Hollywood folklore. But in a town where the greeting \"hello\" is considered a bare-faced lie, Wasserman ran way ahead of the pack. His outbursts, usually directed at his hapless staff, are as legendary as his business skills. This is the man who unceremoniously fired Shirley Temple when her career fizzled out.</p> <p>Once Wasserman had mastered the balance of kid-glove client control with iron-fist contract negotiation, MCA's dominance was all but assured. In 1962 the Justice Dept. under Bobby Kennedy was so alarmed by the concentration of power in Hollywood that it filed a suit against MCA to restrain Wasserman from controlling what had become the town's biggest agency.</p> <p>Wasserman managed to ward off the relentless Kennedy only by pledging to steer MCA away from the agency business. The following decades saw the corporation in its various incarnations diversify into production, until it came to dominate almost every aspect of the entertainment business: music, radio, television and cinema.</p> <p>Of course, MCA's dominance couldn't last forever. The company was eventually taken over by Japan's Matsushita Electric and then sold, in secret, to the Seagram Company in 1995. Wasserman famously first learned of the deal when it appeared on the front page of the Wall Street Journal. The entire take-over was orchestrated by his spiritual son, Mike Ovitz.</p> <p>When Dustin Hoffman, in his 1989 Oscar acceptance speech (Best Actor for Rain Man), said: \"I thank my agent, Mike Ovitz,\" he effectively outed Ovitz as a major Hollywood power broker. Indeed, Hoffman's proclamation was a community-wide acknowledgement that Ovitz and Creative Artists Agency (the agency he co-founded with Ron Meyer) had come to exercise an incredible influence over what films got made in the Hollywood of the 1980s and early 1990s.</p> <p>As well as representing the biggest names in Tinseltown (Stallone and Schwarzenegger among them), Ovitz adopted Wasserman's practice of packaging his directing clients and his movie stars together. The faltering Brian De Palma (still burnt by The Bonfire of the Vanities and Carlito's Way) received a career boost when he got to direct Cruise in Mission: Impossible, and, in the case of Rain Man, Ovitz famously paired ageing client Hoffman with upcoming CAA new boy Tom Cruise, and provided the Graduate star with a whole new following. Hell, Ovitz even turned his aikido instructor, Steven Seagal, into a movie star.</p> <p>Ovitz eventually left CAA to join Disney as President, an ill-fated move that was followed by a brief fling with the now-bankrupt Broadway company Livent, and he now heads another Hollywood company, Artists Management Group (AMG), which he formed with partners Julie and Rick Yorn.</p> <p>AMG is something new yet again. The central ambition of Ovitz's new organisation is to merge the role of agents and managers. AMG insists it is a management company; agents insist it is also a talent agency. Some AMG clients also have an outside agent. Some have two managers.</p> <p>Ovitz has already upset the natural order by targeting rival management firm Industry Entertainment and luring away some of their hottest clients (Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon).</p> <p>But Ovitz's plans range far beyond simply poaching clients. AMG (which boasts that most telling of Hollywood affectations, an unlisted phone number) is clearly designed to transform Ovitz from super-agent to super-manager, representing top stars and creating a portfolio of outfits that produce in every medium: movies, television, records, concerts and the internet. AMG is propelling the agency business into uncharted new territory; it is poised to transform the management business from a cash cow into a veritable golden fleece. </p> <p>And where Ovitz goes, others follow. Before last Christmas, representatives from Hollywood's top agencies - Endeavor, United Talent Agency, Creative Artists Agency, William Morris and International Creative Management - met with representatives from the Screen Actors Guild to outline a new set of demands. To put it bluntly, they all want to become wheelers and dealers. They want the freedom to buy companies, even production companies, or - in these mega-merger days - to sell their businesses to bigger entities. They also want the opportunity to produce movies and TV shows. Basically, they want to do everything that managers can do.</p> <p>Many in Hollywood believe that such a sweeping change to the natural order is as inevitable as it is overdue. After all, in nearly every sector of the business landscape multi-billion media mergers routinely sail past the regulators. Yet agents - arguably the most entrepreneurial players in town - remain the most tightly regulated under federal restrictions.</p> <p>Nevertheless, whatever agents metamorphose into and whatever new name they dream up for themselves, they are still completely reliant on their clients; still live or die by the talent they land. And that, in short, is why Indiana Jones is currently cracking the bullwhip.</p>",

MCA's impact is hard to understate. MGM head Louis B. Mayer held the company directly responsible for the erosion of the studios' control. Wasserman would persuade actors to buy out their existing studio contracts and sign with him. He then sold those new clients back to the same studios for inflated fees that quickly repaid the buyout, and which executives found themselves powerless to refuse. After all, the public demands its stars. For Wasserman, it was a question of supply and demand. Create a sellers' market, control the commodity supply, cream off that 10%. Eventually, MCA realised that it could boost income from its less popular talent if it refused to let its A-list actors work without B-list support. Thus a lowly director on MCA's books might come as part and parcel of a deal that secured an A-list star. Stories about brutal agents have long been Hollywood folklore. But in a town where the greeting \"hello\" is considered a bare-faced lie, Wasserman ran way ahead of the pack. His outbursts, usually directed at his hapless staff, are as legendary as his business skills. This is the man who unceremoniously fired Shirley Temple when her career fizzled out. Once Wasserman had mastered the balance of kid-glove client control with iron-fist contract negotiation, MCA's dominance was all but assured. In 1962 the Justice Dept. under Bobby Kennedy was so alarmed by the concentration of power in Hollywood that it filed a suit against MCA to restrain Wasserman from controlling what had become the town's biggest agency. Wasserman managed to ward off the relentless Kennedy only by pledging to steer MCA away from the agency business. The following decades saw the corporation in its various incarnations diversify into production, until it came to dominate almost every aspect of the entertainment business: music, radio, television and cinema. Of course, MCA's dominance couldn't last forever. The company was eventually taken over by Japan's Matsushita Electric and then sold, in secret, to the Seagram Company in 1995. Wasserman famously first learned of the deal when it appeared on the front page of the Wall Street Journal. The entire take-over was orchestrated by his spiritual son, Mike Ovitz. When Dustin Hoffman, in his 1989 Oscar acceptance speech (Best Actor for Rain Man), said: \"I thank my agent, Mike Ovitz,\" he effectively outed Ovitz as a major Hollywood power broker. Indeed, Hoffman's proclamation was a community-wide acknowledgement that Ovitz and Creative Artists Agency (the agency he co-founded with Ron Meyer) had come to exercise an incredible influence over what films got made in the Hollywood of the 1980s and early 1990s. As well as representing the biggest names in Tinseltown (Stallone and Schwarzenegger among them), Ovitz adopted Wasserman's practice of packaging his directing clients and his movie stars together. The faltering Brian De Palma (still burnt by The Bonfire of the Vanities and Carlito's Way) received a career boost when he got to direct Cruise in Mission: Impossible, and, in the case of Rain Man, Ovitz famously paired ageing client Hoffman with upcoming CAA new boy Tom Cruise, and provided the Graduate star with a whole new following. Hell, Ovitz even turned his aikido instructor, Steven Seagal, into a movie star. Ovitz eventually left CAA to join Disney as President, an ill-fated move that was followed by a brief fling with the now-bankrupt Broadway company Livent, and he now heads another Hollywood company, Artists Management Group (AMG), which he formed with partners Julie and Rick Yorn. AMG is something new yet again. The central ambition of Ovitz's new organisation is to merge the role of agents and managers. AMG insists it is a management company; agents insist it is also a talent agency. Some AMG clients also have an outside agent. Some have two managers. Ovitz has already upset the natural order by targeting rival management firm Industry Entertainment and luring away some of their hottest clients (Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon). But Ovitz's plans range far beyond simply poaching clients. AMG (which boasts that most telling of Hollywood affectations, an unlisted phone number) is clearly designed to transform Ovitz from super-agent to super-manager, representing top stars and creating a portfolio of outfits that produce in every medium: movies, television, records, concerts and the internet. AMG is propelling the agency business into uncharted new territory; it is poised to transform the management business from a cash cow into a veritable golden fleece. And where Ovitz goes, others follow. Before last Christmas, representatives from Hollywood's top agencies - Endeavor, United Talent Agency, Creative Artists Agency, William Morris and International Creative Management - met with representatives from the Screen Actors Guild to outline a new set of demands. To put it bluntly, they all want to become wheelers and dealers. They want the freedom to buy companies, even production companies, or - in these mega-merger days - to sell their businesses to bigger entities. They also want the opportunity to produce movies and TV shows. Basically, they want to do everything that managers can do. Many in Hollywood believe that such a sweeping change to the natural order is as inevitable as it is overdue. After all, in nearly every sector of the business landscape multi-billion media mergers routinely sail past the regulators. Yet agents - arguably the most entrepreneurial players in town - remain the most tightly regulated under federal restrictions. Nevertheless, whatever agents metamorphose into and whatever new name they dream up for themselves, they are still completely reliant on their clients; still live or die by the talent they land. And that, in short, is why Indiana Jones is currently cracking the bullwhip.",

[David Blunkett, Labour minister]</p> <p>\"I don't see why London has to suffer because he hasn't fulfilled his ambition to be party leader.\" [Brian Sedgemore, Labour MP]</p> <p>There can seldom have been a political figure in recent political history who so divided opinion, even amongst his colleagues. He is hugely ahead in the opinion polls while spurned by most of his fellow MPs. To many who have never met or worked with him he is charismatic, popular, cheeky and personable. To many who have, he is difficult and manipulative. To Millbank and Downing Street he is anathema. </p> <p>The prime minister has made no secret of his loathing for Ken Livingstone and has expended considerable personal effort to snuff out his chances of ever becoming mayor - to the extent where many wondered whether this was becoming an unhealthy obsession. </p> <p>More surprising has been the extent to which people formerly or currently on the left have pointedly refused to support Mr Livingstone or have positively attacked him. Only this week the international development seretary, Clare Short, attacked Mr Livingstone in print, with the active encouragement of senior figures in government. </p> <p>But more often the campaign against Mr Livingstone has been more covert. A word here, a piece of \"helpful guidance\" there. Journalists would be approached and told that Ken was charming but \"a liar\". He was \"a Trot\", an unreformed and incorrigible \"oppositionist\". He was out for himself, not a team player. </p> <p>The problem with most such comments were that they were off the record, uncheckable and often defamatory. Over nearly a month we contacted many of Mr Livingstone's known detractors and invited them to put the case against him publicly - so long as they were prepared to do so attributably. Some refused these conditions. Many did not. </p> <p>The picture that emerged of Ken Livingstone - with some unexpected exceptions - was that of a self-obsessed, vain and manipulative opportunist who is temperamentally unable to deliver for London. Opponents ranging from members of the cabinet to former colleagues on the Greater London council warn that Mr Livingstone as mayor would become the de facto opposition to Tony Blair's government. </p> <p>\"He's a dodgy politician, an opportunist,\" said Bernie Grant, who once stood for Labour's deputy leadership with Mr Livingstone as leader.\"He's got his own agenda and he's not going to follow the party's policy in relation to London. I think there is going to be a big row with the leadership of the party and Londoners are going to lose out by it.\" </p> <p>Brian Sedgemore, the leftwing MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, said: \"Ken is a sad and lonely figure. He continually portrays himself as a victim when he is in fact a destructive manipulator. If you slice him through the middle what you see is a man whose heart does not pump for the Labour party but who is completely obsessed with himself.\" </p> <p>Opponents of Mr Livingstone concede there is no single action by the former GLC leader which demonstrates his unsuitability for office. But they argue that his style, and what Terry Ashton, former general secretary of the London Labour party, calls \"the drip, drip, drip - really splash, splash, splash - of unhelpful comments and criticisms\" would be disastrous. To his critics, comments widely reported yesterday allying himself with anarchist rioters in Seattle and London, are just a taster of things to come. </p> <p>Neil Kinnock, the last Labour leader to deal with Mr Livingstone running London, said he would be \"an absolute answer to a prayer\" for Tory-supporting papers. \"I've got no reason to believe that if he found himself in the mayor's chair he wouldn't continue to extrude half-arsed ideas. When it's a Labour backbencher it doesn't matter all that much. When it's the mayor of London - picked up, examined and splattered across every tabloid front page - the only person envious of him would be William Hague, because of the coverage he got in embarrassing the Labour party. It comes down to the inclination of Labour party members to poke the Labour government in the eye with a sharp stick. It's got nothing to do with Ken and everything to do with the assertion of independence of the Labour rank and file. I completely, totally understand that, but its just not sensible ... you can't afford to mess about.\" </p> <p>Mr Sedgemore told the Guardian that Mr Livingstone's call for the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to go \"belongs to the Alice-in-Wonderland world of politics. One wonders why he wants the post when Ken clearly can't work with the prime minister. He keeps saying that he gets on with Tony Blair - it's a preposterous allegation. To get on with somebody takes two people.\" </p> <p>David Blunkett, now education secretary but also leader of Sheffield metropolitan council in the 1980s, has called the mayoral selection a \"defining moment\" for Labour members. He said: \"Everything that he's done has always been antagonistic to the Labour leadership, it's always been about confrontation, exposing and dividing, not about healing and uniting. His great talent is in fact to present himself and to spin a case but that's not the same thing as being able to do deals and provide answers.\" </p> <p>Clive Soley, who chaired the panel which eventually allowed Ken to compete in the ballot to become Labour's candidate, said: \"He is in his way a classic individualist - a bit like David Owen, or Enoch [Powell], or Tony Benn. In Ken's case it's the cheeky chappie who says, 'I'm thumbing my nose at the government'. That's fun, you know. But what we in the Labour party have to say is if we want someone to do that, why don't we vote for [Tory hopeful] Steve Norris, who will do it rather better?\" </p> <p><b> Interview</b><br> </p> <p> Mr Soley said that in advance of Mr Livingstone's interview with the panel in November, he had been uncertain about whether he should be allowed to contest the party's primary. \"On that first five minutes or so of the interview he was making it impossible for us. </p> <p>\"I was quite prepared - much more so than others - to say, he actually is saying I'm not going to sign up to the manifesto. As that day wore on it actually got much more messy, and you got the other side of Ken which is this bit of him which is what makes him popular - the guy in the pub who says, 'I think this, and I think this, and have another pint', and before too long you're clutching your head ... he seemed to be flipping all over the place.\" Mr Soley added: \"I have to say anybody else who had been refusing to sign up to the manifesto wouldn't have got through. The only reason he got through was he's Ken Livingstone and a lot of party members wanted him.\" </p> <p>Margaret Hodge, one-time Islington council leader and now, as a junior employment minister, a fully paid-up member of the Blairite project, said: \"Ken's such a loner. Because he's after the very quick headline ... he'll focus on the wrong things, he won't facilitate partnerships. The great prize of the mayor is the political voice it gives you. That's why he wants it. He will use that political voice destructively for Labour, to be even more vocal in attacking Gordon and attacking Tony.\" </p> <p>Mr Livingstone used the pages of Labour Left Briefing to declare last month: \"I intend to fight a clean fight - there will be no negative campaigning from my supporters.\" Yet there is strong evidence that he was behind the spate of reports that the Labour mayoral candidate backed by Downing Street, Frank Dobson, was \"depressed\". The journalist John Lloyd said he clearly remembered Mr Livingstone saying so in an interview in October, but asked for it not to be attributed to him. Other journalists claim to have heard Mr Livingstone use the term \"clinically depressed\" about Mr Dobson. </p> <p>To his critics, such unattributable briefing fitted a pattern with Mr Livingstone's tactics both during his attempt to wrest the Labour nomination for Brent East from sitting MP Reg Freeson, and during his assaults on Neil Kinnock's leadership in the 1980s. Mr Livingstone once said: \"Poor Kevin Barron [Mr Kinnock's PPS]. Even he is in total despair with Kinnock. He says privately it would have been good to have a leadership contest with an alternative candidate.\" Mr Barron fiercely denies making any such remark. </p> <p>For some like the now-Blairite John Carr, the former chair of the GLC staff committee, Mr Livingstone becoming Labour's candidate would be a political disaster not because of what he does, but what he is. \"People voted Labour for the first time or came back to Labour in 1997 because Blair implicitly or explicitly said that people like Ken Livingstone and the politics of the 80s were dead, buried and gone forever. How would we ever explain to those people ... how a man like Ken now ends up in perhaps the second most important political job in Britain?\" </p> <p><b> The GLC record</b><br> </p> <p> Among Ken Livingstone's opponents there is uncertainty about the line of attack on - or whether to attack at all - his record in running the Greater London council from 1981 to 1986. </p> <p>Several people close to Tony Blair are keen to turn away from a debate about the GLC, preferring instead to focus on what they perceive as Mr Livingstone's record of almost unremitting hostility to the Labour leadership since entering parliament in 1987. Members or former members of the government - Paul Boateng, Tony Banks, Margaret Hodge - were in the GLC or associated with GLC controversy. \"They've changed, he hasn't,\" is the Downing Street refrain. </p> <p>But if, as they argue, Mr Livingstone has achieved little since the GLC, what are Labour members to make of his record the last time he did do something? </p> <p>In early 1984, polls indicated half of all Londoners opposed abolition of the GLC; by late 1984, that figure had risen to three-quarters. The GLC spent \u00a325m on advertising and public relations between October 1983 and March 1985, of which \u00a314m was directly about abolition. Aggressive, clever and funny assaults on the Tories - including displaying London's unemployment figures on a huge banner along County Hall, opposite parliament - boosted Mr Livingstone's popularity and frequently contrasted with the feebleness of the attack on the Tories by Labour at Westminster. </p> <p>Some metropolitan councillors blamed Mr Livingstone for provoking Mrs Thatcher into abolition. Lord (Kenneth) Baker, the minister appointed by Mrs Thatcher to take on Mr Livingstone, told the Guardian: \"We were determined to do in the GLC anyway but I think that by his conduct of the GLC he made it easier for us to do it ... at the end of the day, when the GLC was abolished in 1986, there were not many tears. It had ceased to be an effective local government agency.\" </p> <p>As leader of the GLC, Mr Livingstone made good Labour's promise to bring in a massive cut in bus and tube fares. Labour promised a 25% cut in its manifesto and delivered a 32% cut. The policy, under the banner Fares Fair, was popular and reduced car numbers in London by 15%. But it was overturned by a law lords ruling in December 1981, triggered by a protest from the outer london council of Bromley, which complained it was being asked to fund cheap fares when its ratepayers were miles from the nearest tube station. </p> <p>\"They [the GLC] were actually copying what was taking place in South Yorkshire - and they implemented it so badly that it allowed the Bromley challenge,\" said Mr Blunkett. \"The way it was introduced virtually guaranteed that it would live only for months,\" said Mr Kinnock. \"A very good idea was effectively destroyed.\" But the former Labour GLC leader, Lord McIntosh, in a rare concession to Mr Livingstone, who deposed him, and his supporters, exempts them from blame. </p> <p>The GLC precept on the rates almost doubled in London under Mr Livingstone, from 21p under the Tories in 1980 to 39.7p in 1983, and 36.9p in 1984 - in line, says Mr Livingstone, with Labour's election promises. Overall, it increased the GLC's budget of roughly \u00a31bn under the Tories to \u00a31.534bn by 1984, though this was brought down by rate-capping and the courts to \u00a31.34bn by the time of abolition. Clashes with the government over money culminated in March 1985, when the GLC went to the wire in refusing to set a rate and produce a budget. Mr Livingstone eventually agreed to a budget that was, at a rate of 33.8p, considerably lower than the limits prescribed by the government of 36.5p. </p> <p>The crisis was, both in policy and tactical terms, a disaster. Mr Livingstone fell out bitterly with leftwing colleagues in cluding John McDonnell, now MP for Hayes and Harlington and once again his ally. Mr Livingstone accused Mr McDonnell, chairman of the finance committee, of concealing the GLC's true financial position; Mr McDonnell, who joined nine other Labour members including Tony Banks and Paul Boateng in refusing to set a rate, accused Mr Livingstone of \"bottling out\". </p> <p><b> Minority groups</b><br> </p> <p> Lord Baker says there was \"a real danger\" that the GLC would refuse to set a rate. But he adds: \"I always felt Livingstone wouldn't go right over the wire - he'd take it up to the wire and make it as grim as possible but never actually go over. The consequences would have played into our hands which is why Livingstone was very careful not to do it. There would have been old people's homes that weren't maintained, schools that would have closed, everything would have collapsed.\" </p> <p>The GLC devoted substantial funds to community and minority groups, the so-called rainbow coalition. Mr Livingstone, according to Mr Kinnock, \"became quickly and widely-known as an enthusiast for, sponsor of, spender of public money on, an assortment of zany ultra-left fads that obscured good work that the GLC did - and it also got a national reputation which had repercussions and political returns just about everywhere. Everywhere in the country, where we had a byelection or local election we could distinguish what became known as the London Livingstone effect - the loony left - and he never made any attempt to counteract it. And of course it was a burden that we carried with us. That was Ken's main and lasting contribution.\" </p> <p>Cash for organisations such as Babies Against The Bomb - a creche for the children of peace protesters - won huge and adverse publicity. The GLC's equality and anti-racism policies are regarded even by some Livingstone critics as farsighted then and mainstream now. But Mr Kinnock said: \"The way in which they did it completely alienated potential support ... there was a certain arrogance in the enthusiasm, the idea that there shouldn't be any compromise with the electorate. It's difficult to think of Babies Against The Bomb as mainstream. Ordinary Labour voters of all classes in society just looked at it and thought, what the bloody hell is going on?\" </p> <p>How much credit, or blame, should Mr Livingstone take? Colleagues and critics portray a relaxed, confident leader, prepared to share praise and responsibility, strong on the big picture but weak on detail and, above all, a sucker for publicity. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett said: \"Our objection to Ken was that he never delivered. It [ the mayor] has got to be somebody who is prepared to do business with government rather than constantly saying it wasn't me guv, I wanted to do this, they stopped me ... that was the style all the way along.\" </p> <p>On the other hand Bill Bush, chief of staff at the GLC and now a Downing Street adviser, told Mr Livingstone's biographer, Guardian journalist John Carvel: \"On the big issues I don't remember him ever being bounced by officials into an ill-considered decision.\" Mr Livingstone, he said, was \"good at delegating, phenomenally productive\", and because of his willingness to take public responsibility for mistakes, inspired people to \"die in the last ditch for him\". </p> <p>John Carr says Mr Livingstone was \"a very good leader\". But he said his work in the council was often overshadowed by his rent-a-quote, grandstanding style. Mr Livingstone famously refused an invitation to the Charles-Diana royal wedding and made a series of controversial stands on Northern Ireland, inviting Sinn Fein to County Hall and commenting that the bombers who killed a woman at the Chelsea barracks were \"not criminals or lunatics\" in 1981. </p> <p>Lord McIntosh, now Labour's deputy chief whip in the Lords, said : \"His term of office apart from Fares Fair ... was not only undistinguished and unsuccessful in policy terms but actually offensive in the sense that a great deal of ratepayers money was spent on the personal whims of the people who were running the council.\" </p> <p>Illtyd Harrington said: \"I don't underestimate his popularity ... he's got a determination which I think is good, he's got a ruthlessness that would make him a success, but he doesn't believe in anything. His weakness is his incredible vanity. The only consistency Ken has is to himself. That sounds critical: he's always very friendly to me ... I can see why London likes him. I always remember one of my extended family saying to me, 'you know why we like Ken?' in the 80s. 'It's because we go home and our parents hate him' ... Tony Blair is like the parents.\" </p> <p><b> Livingstone and plotting</b><br> </p> <p> With an inimitable mixture of humour and faint menace, Ken Livingstone once said: \"I love meetings and plottings. I didn't get where I am today without plotting.\" </p> <p>He earned a reputation as an opportunist and carpetbagger by moving swiftly through spells on Lambeth and Camden councils, and on the GLC in Norwood, Hackney and Paddington. But he won a respect and fear in equal measure from his most famous plot, unseating Andrew (now Lord) McIntosh as leader of the GLC the day after Labour took power in the 1981 council elections. </p> <p>\"He came to power as a complete machine politician, spending his time on internal battles within the Labour party rather than fighting the Conservative party,\" Lord McIntosh said. \"Whenever he was asked whether he would stand against me he equivocated. He's been doing exactly the same thing now ... [about] whether he would stand as an independent if he were not to be a Labour candidate. </p> <p>\"A few people, a few leftwingers, some of them Trotskyite - not Ken, he never had the ideological commitment to be a Trotskyite - they met together, they decided a common line. They then got into larger groups and decided a common line. They then got into the Greater London Labour party and by having a common line they often outvoted the trade unions and more moderate people.\" </p> <p>Mr Livingstone's links with leftwing groups outside the Labour party date back to 1978 and his connection with the Socialist Campaign for a Labour Victory and its newspaper, Socialist Organiser, which once backed Mr Livingstone, then fell out with him, and is now defunct. </p> <p>The SCLV argued for socialists to campaign against the \"pro-capitalist record\" of the then Labour government. Mr Livingstone was enthusiastically supported by London Labour Briefing. In its current guise, Labour Left Briefing, it supports Livingstone for the mayoralty and continues to assault the Labour leadership. </p> <p>Lady (Glenys) Thornton, former chair of the London Labour party (and John Carr's wife) said: \"His record during that period was one of damning these people that didn't agree with his kind of 'politics of the people' and making life miserable for them. One of the worst characteristics of the London Labour party in the 80s was his treatment of some of the people that wished to challenge the hegemony. It wasn't about wider democratic politics - it was about who controls the left; in that sense it's classic Trotskyist politics.\" </p> <p>Mr Livingstone, Lambeth leader Ted Knight, and another Lambeth councillor, Matthew Warburton, set up the newspaper Labour Herald. He withdrew from the board as he was condemned for finally agreeing to set a budget in the capping row which split Mr Livingstone from many of his colleagues in 1985. Labour Herald was printed by Astmoor Litho, a publishing company owned by the Workers' Revolutionary Party, the vehicle of his friend, the leader Gerry Healy. \"He [Livingstone] is not a dinosaur, not a kind of stick in the mud Trotskyite... fundamentally he's an old fashioned Keynesian tax-and-spend socialist who doesn't agree with the whole drift of Labour policy these days,\" said John Carr. \"Ken did get very embroiled - inexplicably to some - in some of the internal disputes that were in the WRP over Gerry Healy and Vanessa Redgrave and all of that.\" </p> <p>Last year Ken Livingstone said of Mr Healy: \"I never met the man until I was 36 years old and I am far too independent-minded ever to submit myself to Marxist discipline.\" But in the foreword to a book, Gerry Healy: A Revolutionary Life, Mr Livingstone painted a different gloss. Though the men had \"fundamental differences\", he wrote, \"it was a privilege to have worked with Gerry Healy\". Healy's paper, News Line, was \"thorough and objective\" in its coverage of the GLC. Mr Livingstone still attracts support from left groups outside the Labour party. \"Organise for Livingstone! Break free from Millbank mafia,\" calls Socialist Outlook, a monthly Marxist review. Last month's Socialist Review reported: \"Millions betrayed by Labour: The campaign by Livingstone for mayor can become a rallying point for all those who oppose the Blair agenda in a way which goes beyond Livingstone's actual politics, which is why those on the left support him against Blair.\" </p> <p>After Socialist Workers Party supporters picketed Mr Sedgemore's surgery in his support, Mr Livingstone said it was a \"very serious falsehood\" to suggest he was being funded by the SWP. Socialist Action, formerly the International Marxist Group, has also given him strong support. \"The truth is that I am prepared to work for people when there is political agreement,\" he said, but denied being their \"tool\". </p> <p>John Ross, a former leading light of Socialist Action, was appointed as his researcher in 1987, helped compile his extensive economic database and, now working for the Russian trade union movement based in Moscow, is still employed part-time by Livingstone to help produce his Socialist Economic Bulletin, a periodical funded by the MP's outside earnings through his company LocalAction. His chief of staff, Simon Fletcher, has links with Socialist Action and Mr Livingstone is close to another Socialist Action mainstay, Redmond O'Neill. \"I just always operated within the Labour party and was prepared to work with any left groupings inside or outside it on a series of policy issues,\" Mr Livingstone told John Carvel. \"The relationship goes hot and cold.\" </p> <p>Mr Kinnock said of Mr Livingstone's supporters: \"If you are relying on people to do your footslogging who are from the ultra left they do have a certain temperament. Politics is their whole life, they've got no hinterland, they are obsessive and really the siege troops came from that element ... despite, frequently, their intellectual intelligence, they're the daftest sods, so they must be easy to manipulate.\" </p> <p>But Mr Kinnock exempts Mr Livingstone from the charge of being a Trotskyist. \"He's a Kennist. He really is. 'Red Ken' was always a bit of a joke. I don't think he's even a Red.\" </p> <p>According to John Carr, Mr Livingstone as GLC leader was always focused on becoming an MP. He was foiled in his attempt to take Brent East in 1983 but eventually succeeded in forcing out Reg Freeson in 1987 as part of a sustained campaign by leftwingers working through a group, Target 87. The GLC set up an Irish centre in Brent during Mr Livingstone's tenure, which went through a series of crises and overspends. \"He indulged the Irish people there, and they indulged him by voting for him,\" said Illtyd Harrington. Mr Freeson said Mr Livingstone's supporters made life so difficult for him that \"in effect I was being excluded, and quite consciously excluded from doing my job as an MP\". </p> <p><b> In parliament</b><br> </p> <p> By any standards, Ken Livingstone's 12-year parliamentary career has been undistinguished, proof, critics say, of his inability to forge alliances and work with colleagues. For the mayoral race he has the support of eight of London's 57 Labour MPs, including himself; Mr Dobson has 43. Initially coldshouldered by members of the leftwing Campaign group, angry with him for what they saw as his cave-in over capping, Mr Livingstone has failed, as some expected, to take over from Tony Benn as leader of the parliamentary left. </p> <p>Though Mr Livingstone was the Campaign group's choice to run for leader in 1992 - he won the support of only 13 MPs when he needed 55 to make it through to the final ballot - it did not consolidate his position. He shared the ticket with Bernie Grant but, says Mr Grant, \"there was no working together.

[David Blunkett, Labour minister] \"I don't see why London has to suffer because he hasn't fulfilled his ambition to be party leader.\" [Brian Sedgemore, Labour MP] There can seldom have been a political figure in recent political history who so divided opinion, even amongst his colleagues. He is hugely ahead in the opinion polls while spurned by most of his fellow MPs. To many who have never met or worked with him he is charismatic, popular, cheeky and personable. To many who have, he is difficult and manipulative. To Millbank and Downing Street he is anathema. The prime minister has made no secret of his loathing for Ken Livingstone and has expended considerable personal effort to snuff out his chances of ever becoming mayor - to the extent where many wondered whether this was becoming an unhealthy obsession. More surprising has been the extent to which people formerly or currently on the left have pointedly refused to support Mr Livingstone or have positively attacked him. Only this week the international development seretary, Clare Short, attacked Mr Livingstone in print, with the active encouragement of senior figures in government. But more often the campaign against Mr Livingstone has been more covert. A word here, a piece of \"helpful guidance\" there. Journalists would be approached and told that Ken was charming but \"a liar\". He was \"a Trot\", an unreformed and incorrigible \"oppositionist\". He was out for himself, not a team player. The problem with most such comments were that they were off the record, uncheckable and often defamatory. Over nearly a month we contacted many of Mr Livingstone's known detractors and invited them to put the case against him publicly - so long as they were prepared to do so attributably. Some refused these conditions. Many did not. The picture that emerged of Ken Livingstone - with some unexpected exceptions - was that of a self-obsessed, vain and manipulative opportunist who is temperamentally unable to deliver for London. Opponents ranging from members of the cabinet to former colleagues on the Greater London council warn that Mr Livingstone as mayor would become the de facto opposition to Tony Blair's government. \"He's a dodgy politician, an opportunist,\" said Bernie Grant, who once stood for Labour's deputy leadership with Mr Livingstone as leader.\"He's got his own agenda and he's not going to follow the party's policy in relation to London. I think there is going to be a big row with the leadership of the party and Londoners are going to lose out by it.\" Brian Sedgemore, the leftwing MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, said: \"Ken is a sad and lonely figure. He continually portrays himself as a victim when he is in fact a destructive manipulator. If you slice him through the middle what you see is a man whose heart does not pump for the Labour party but who is completely obsessed with himself.\" Opponents of Mr Livingstone concede there is no single action by the former GLC leader which demonstrates his unsuitability for office. But they argue that his style, and what Terry Ashton, former general secretary of the London Labour party, calls \"the drip, drip, drip - really splash, splash, splash - of unhelpful comments and criticisms\" would be disastrous. To his critics, comments widely reported yesterday allying himself with anarchist rioters in Seattle and London, are just a taster of things to come. Neil Kinnock, the last Labour leader to deal with Mr Livingstone running London, said he would be \"an absolute answer to a prayer\" for Tory-supporting papers. \"I've got no reason to believe that if he found himself in the mayor's chair he wouldn't continue to extrude half-arsed ideas. When it's a Labour backbencher it doesn't matter all that much. When it's the mayor of London - picked up, examined and splattered across every tabloid front page - the only person envious of him would be William Hague, because of the coverage he got in embarrassing the Labour party. It comes down to the inclination of Labour party members to poke the Labour government in the eye with a sharp stick. It's got nothing to do with Ken and everything to do with the assertion of independence of the Labour rank and file. I completely, totally understand that, but its just not sensible ... you can't afford to mess about.\" Mr Sedgemore told the Guardian that Mr Livingstone's call for the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to go \"belongs to the Alice-in-Wonderland world of politics. One wonders why he wants the post when Ken clearly can't work with the prime minister. He keeps saying that he gets on with Tony Blair - it's a preposterous allegation. To get on with somebody takes two people.\" David Blunkett, now education secretary but also leader of Sheffield metropolitan council in the 1980s, has called the mayoral selection a \"defining moment\" for Labour members. He said: \"Everything that he's done has always been antagonistic to the Labour leadership, it's always been about confrontation, exposing and dividing, not about healing and uniting. His great talent is in fact to present himself and to spin a case but that's not the same thing as being able to do deals and provide answers.\" Clive Soley, who chaired the panel which eventually allowed Ken to compete in the ballot to become Labour's candidate, said: \"He is in his way a classic individualist - a bit like David Owen, or Enoch [Powell], or Tony Benn. In Ken's case it's the cheeky chappie who says, 'I'm thumbing my nose at the government'. That's fun, you know. But what we in the Labour party have to say is if we want someone to do that, why don't we vote for [Tory hopeful] Steve Norris, who will do it rather better?\" Interview Mr Soley said that in advance of Mr Livingstone's interview with the panel in November, he had been uncertain about whether he should be allowed to contest the party's primary. \"On that first five minutes or so of the interview he was making it impossible for us. \"I was quite prepared - much more so than others - to say, he actually is saying I'm not going to sign up to the manifesto. As that day wore on it actually got much more messy, and you got the other side of Ken which is this bit of him which is what makes him popular - the guy in the pub who says, 'I think this, and I think this, and have another pint', and before too long you're clutching your head ... he seemed to be flipping all over the place.\" Mr Soley added: \"I have to say anybody else who had been refusing to sign up to the manifesto wouldn't have got through. The only reason he got through was he's Ken Livingstone and a lot of party members wanted him.\" Margaret Hodge, one-time Islington council leader and now, as a junior employment minister, a fully paid-up member of the Blairite project, said: \"Ken's such a loner. Because he's after the very quick headline ... he'll focus on the wrong things, he won't facilitate partnerships. The great prize of the mayor is the political voice it gives you. That's why he wants it. He will use that political voice destructively for Labour, to be even more vocal in attacking Gordon and attacking Tony.\" Mr Livingstone used the pages of Labour Left Briefing to declare last month: \"I intend to fight a clean fight - there will be no negative campaigning from my supporters.\" Yet there is strong evidence that he was behind the spate of reports that the Labour mayoral candidate backed by Downing Street, Frank Dobson, was \"depressed\". The journalist John Lloyd said he clearly remembered Mr Livingstone saying so in an interview in October, but asked for it not to be attributed to him. Other journalists claim to have heard Mr Livingstone use the term \"clinically depressed\" about Mr Dobson. To his critics, such unattributable briefing fitted a pattern with Mr Livingstone's tactics both during his attempt to wrest the Labour nomination for Brent East from sitting MP Reg Freeson, and during his assaults on Neil Kinnock's leadership in the 1980s. Mr Livingstone once said: \"Poor Kevin Barron [Mr Kinnock's PPS]. Even he is in total despair with Kinnock. He says privately it would have been good to have a leadership contest with an alternative candidate.\" Mr Barron fiercely denies making any such remark. For some like the now-Blairite John Carr, the former chair of the GLC staff committee, Mr Livingstone becoming Labour's candidate would be a political disaster not because of what he does, but what he is. \"People voted Labour for the first time or came back to Labour in 1997 because Blair implicitly or explicitly said that people like Ken Livingstone and the politics of the 80s were dead, buried and gone forever. How would we ever explain to those people ... how a man like Ken now ends up in perhaps the second most important political job in Britain?\" The GLC record Among Ken Livingstone's opponents there is uncertainty about the line of attack on - or whether to attack at all - his record in running the Greater London council from 1981 to 1986. Several people close to Tony Blair are keen to turn away from a debate about the GLC, preferring instead to focus on what they perceive as Mr Livingstone's record of almost unremitting hostility to the Labour leadership since entering parliament in 1987. Members or former members of the government - Paul Boateng, Tony Banks, Margaret Hodge - were in the GLC or associated with GLC controversy. \"They've changed, he hasn't,\" is the Downing Street refrain. But if, as they argue, Mr Livingstone has achieved little since the GLC, what are Labour members to make of his record the last time he did do something? In early 1984, polls indicated half of all Londoners opposed abolition of the GLC; by late 1984, that figure had risen to three-quarters. The GLC spent \u00a325m on advertising and public relations between October 1983 and March 1985, of which \u00a314m was directly about abolition. Aggressive, clever and funny assaults on the Tories - including displaying London's unemployment figures on a huge banner along County Hall, opposite parliament - boosted Mr Livingstone's popularity and frequently contrasted with the feebleness of the attack on the Tories by Labour at Westminster. Some metropolitan councillors blamed Mr Livingstone for provoking Mrs Thatcher into abolition. Lord (Kenneth) Baker, the minister appointed by Mrs Thatcher to take on Mr Livingstone, told the Guardian: \"We were determined to do in the GLC anyway but I think that by his conduct of the GLC he made it easier for us to do it ... at the end of the day, when the GLC was abolished in 1986, there were not many tears. It had ceased to be an effective local government agency.\" As leader of the GLC, Mr Livingstone made good Labour's promise to bring in a massive cut in bus and tube fares. Labour promised a 25% cut in its manifesto and delivered a 32% cut. The policy, under the banner Fares Fair, was popular and reduced car numbers in London by 15%. But it was overturned by a law lords ruling in December 1981, triggered by a protest from the outer london council of Bromley, which complained it was being asked to fund cheap fares when its ratepayers were miles from the nearest tube station. \"They [the GLC] were actually copying what was taking place in South Yorkshire - and they implemented it so badly that it allowed the Bromley challenge,\" said Mr Blunkett. \"The way it was introduced virtually guaranteed that it would live only for months,\" said Mr Kinnock. \"A very good idea was effectively destroyed.\" But the former Labour GLC leader, Lord McIntosh, in a rare concession to Mr Livingstone, who deposed him, and his supporters, exempts them from blame. The GLC precept on the rates almost doubled in London under Mr Livingstone, from 21p under the Tories in 1980 to 39.7p in 1983, and 36.9p in 1984 - in line, says Mr Livingstone, with Labour's election promises. Overall, it increased the GLC's budget of roughly \u00a31bn under the Tories to \u00a31.534bn by 1984, though this was brought down by rate-capping and the courts to \u00a31.34bn by the time of abolition. Clashes with the government over money culminated in March 1985, when the GLC went to the wire in refusing to set a rate and produce a budget. Mr Livingstone eventually agreed to a budget that was, at a rate of 33.8p, considerably lower than the limits prescribed by the government of 36.5p. The crisis was, both in policy and tactical terms, a disaster. Mr Livingstone fell out bitterly with leftwing colleagues in cluding John McDonnell, now MP for Hayes and Harlington and once again his ally. Mr Livingstone accused Mr McDonnell, chairman of the finance committee, of concealing the GLC's true financial position; Mr McDonnell, who joined nine other Labour members including Tony Banks and Paul Boateng in refusing to set a rate, accused Mr Livingstone of \"bottling out\". Minority groups Lord Baker says there was \"a real danger\" that the GLC would refuse to set a rate. But he adds: \"I always felt Livingstone wouldn't go right over the wire - he'd take it up to the wire and make it as grim as possible but never actually go over. The consequences would have played into our hands which is why Livingstone was very careful not to do it. There would have been old people's homes that weren't maintained, schools that would have closed, everything would have collapsed.\" The GLC devoted substantial funds to community and minority groups, the so-called rainbow coalition. Mr Livingstone, according to Mr Kinnock, \"became quickly and widely-known as an enthusiast for, sponsor of, spender of public money on, an assortment of zany ultra-left fads that obscured good work that the GLC did - and it also got a national reputation which had repercussions and political returns just about everywhere. Everywhere in the country, where we had a byelection or local election we could distinguish what became known as the London Livingstone effect - the loony left - and he never made any attempt to counteract it. And of course it was a burden that we carried with us. That was Ken's main and lasting contribution.\" Cash for organisations such as Babies Against The Bomb - a creche for the children of peace protesters - won huge and adverse publicity. The GLC's equality and anti-racism policies are regarded even by some Livingstone critics as farsighted then and mainstream now. But Mr Kinnock said: \"The way in which they did it completely alienated potential support ... there was a certain arrogance in the enthusiasm, the idea that there shouldn't be any compromise with the electorate. It's difficult to think of Babies Against The Bomb as mainstream. Ordinary Labour voters of all classes in society just looked at it and thought, what the bloody hell is going on?\" How much credit, or blame, should Mr Livingstone take? Colleagues and critics portray a relaxed, confident leader, prepared to share praise and responsibility, strong on the big picture but weak on detail and, above all, a sucker for publicity. Mr Blunkett said: \"Our objection to Ken was that he never delivered. It [ the mayor] has got to be somebody who is prepared to do business with government rather than constantly saying it wasn't me guv, I wanted to do this, they stopped me ... that was the style all the way along.\" On the other hand Bill Bush, chief of staff at the GLC and now a Downing Street adviser, told Mr Livingstone's biographer, Guardian journalist John Carvel: \"On the big issues I don't remember him ever being bounced by officials into an ill-considered decision.\" Mr Livingstone, he said, was \"good at delegating, phenomenally productive\", and because of his willingness to take public responsibility for mistakes, inspired people to \"die in the last ditch for him\". John Carr says Mr Livingstone was \"a very good leader\". But he said his work in the council was often overshadowed by his rent-a-quote, grandstanding style. Mr Livingstone famously refused an invitation to the Charles-Diana royal wedding and made a series of controversial stands on Northern Ireland, inviting Sinn Fein to County Hall and commenting that the bombers who killed a woman at the Chelsea barracks were \"not criminals or lunatics\" in 1981. Lord McIntosh, now Labour's deputy chief whip in the Lords, said : \"His term of office apart from Fares Fair ... was not only undistinguished and unsuccessful in policy terms but actually offensive in the sense that a great deal of ratepayers money was spent on the personal whims of the people who were running the council.\" Illtyd Harrington said: \"I don't underestimate his popularity ... he's got a determination which I think is good, he's got a ruthlessness that would make him a success, but he doesn't believe in anything. His weakness is his incredible vanity. The only consistency Ken has is to himself. That sounds critical: he's always very friendly to me ... I can see why London likes him. I always remember one of my extended family saying to me, 'you know why we like Ken?' in the 80s. 'It's because we go home and our parents hate him' ... Tony Blair is like the parents.\" Livingstone and plotting With an inimitable mixture of humour and faint menace, Ken Livingstone once said: \"I love meetings and plottings. I didn't get where I am today without plotting.\" He earned a reputation as an opportunist and carpetbagger by moving swiftly through spells on Lambeth and Camden councils, and on the GLC in Norwood, Hackney and Paddington. But he won a respect and fear in equal measure from his most famous plot, unseating Andrew (now Lord) McIntosh as leader of the GLC the day after Labour took power in the 1981 council elections. \"He came to power as a complete machine politician, spending his time on internal battles within the Labour party rather than fighting the Conservative party,\" Lord McIntosh said. \"Whenever he was asked whether he would stand against me he equivocated. He's been doing exactly the same thing now ... [about] whether he would stand as an independent if he were not to be a Labour candidate. \"A few people, a few leftwingers, some of them Trotskyite - not Ken, he never had the ideological commitment to be a Trotskyite - they met together, they decided a common line. They then got into larger groups and decided a common line. They then got into the Greater London Labour party and by having a common line they often outvoted the trade unions and more moderate people.\" Mr Livingstone's links with leftwing groups outside the Labour party date back to 1978 and his connection with the Socialist Campaign for a Labour Victory and its newspaper, Socialist Organiser, which once backed Mr Livingstone, then fell out with him, and is now defunct. The SCLV argued for socialists to campaign against the \"pro-capitalist record\" of the then Labour government. Mr Livingstone was enthusiastically supported by London Labour Briefing. In its current guise, Labour Left Briefing, it supports Livingstone for the mayoralty and continues to assault the Labour leadership. Lady (Glenys) Thornton, former chair of the London Labour party (and John Carr's wife) said: \"His record during that period was one of damning these people that didn't agree with his kind of 'politics of the people' and making life miserable for them. One of the worst characteristics of the London Labour party in the 80s was his treatment of some of the people that wished to challenge the hegemony. It wasn't about wider democratic politics - it was about who controls the left; in that sense it's classic Trotskyist politics.\" Mr Livingstone, Lambeth leader Ted Knight, and another Lambeth councillor, Matthew Warburton, set up the newspaper Labour Herald. He withdrew from the board as he was condemned for finally agreeing to set a budget in the capping row which split Mr Livingstone from many of his colleagues in 1985. Labour Herald was printed by Astmoor Litho, a publishing company owned by the Workers' Revolutionary Party, the vehicle of his friend, the leader Gerry Healy. \"He [Livingstone] is not a dinosaur, not a kind of stick in the mud Trotskyite... fundamentally he's an old fashioned Keynesian tax-and-spend socialist who doesn't agree with the whole drift of Labour policy these days,\" said John Carr. \"Ken did get very embroiled - inexplicably to some - in some of the internal disputes that were in the WRP over Gerry Healy and Vanessa Redgrave and all of that.\" Last year Ken Livingstone said of Mr Healy: \"I never met the man until I was 36 years old and I am far too independent-minded ever to submit myself to Marxist discipline.\" But in the foreword to a book, Gerry Healy: A Revolutionary Life, Mr Livingstone painted a different gloss. Though the men had \"fundamental differences\", he wrote, \"it was a privilege to have worked with Gerry Healy\". Healy's paper, News Line, was \"thorough and objective\" in its coverage of the GLC. Mr Livingstone still attracts support from left groups outside the Labour party. \"Organise for Livingstone! Break free from Millbank mafia,\" calls Socialist Outlook, a monthly Marxist review. Last month's Socialist Review reported: \"Millions betrayed by Labour: The campaign by Livingstone for mayor can become a rallying point for all those who oppose the Blair agenda in a way which goes beyond Livingstone's actual politics, which is why those on the left support him against Blair.\" After Socialist Workers Party supporters picketed Mr Sedgemore's surgery in his support, Mr Livingstone said it was a \"very serious falsehood\" to suggest he was being funded by the SWP. Socialist Action, formerly the International Marxist Group, has also given him strong support. \"The truth is that I am prepared to work for people when there is political agreement,\" he said, but denied being their \"tool\". John Ross, a former leading light of Socialist Action, was appointed as his researcher in 1987, helped compile his extensive economic database and, now working for the Russian trade union movement based in Moscow, is still employed part-time by Livingstone to help produce his Socialist Economic Bulletin, a periodical funded by the MP's outside earnings through his company LocalAction. His chief of staff, Simon Fletcher, has links with Socialist Action and Mr Livingstone is close to another Socialist Action mainstay, Redmond O'Neill. \"I just always operated within the Labour party and was prepared to work with any left groupings inside or outside it on a series of policy issues,\" Mr Livingstone told John Carvel. \"The relationship goes hot and cold.\" Mr Kinnock said of Mr Livingstone's supporters: \"If you are relying on people to do your footslogging who are from the ultra left they do have a certain temperament. Politics is their whole life, they've got no hinterland, they are obsessive and really the siege troops came from that element ... despite, frequently, their intellectual intelligence, they're the daftest sods, so they must be easy to manipulate.\" But Mr Kinnock exempts Mr Livingstone from the charge of being a Trotskyist. \"He's a Kennist. He really is. 'Red Ken' was always a bit of a joke. I don't think he's even a Red.\" According to John Carr, Mr Livingstone as GLC leader was always focused on becoming an MP. He was foiled in his attempt to take Brent East in 1983 but eventually succeeded in forcing out Reg Freeson in 1987 as part of a sustained campaign by leftwingers working through a group, Target 87. The GLC set up an Irish centre in Brent during Mr Livingstone's tenure, which went through a series of crises and overspends. \"He indulged the Irish people there, and they indulged him by voting for him,\" said Illtyd Harrington. Mr Freeson said Mr Livingstone's supporters made life so difficult for him that \"in effect I was being excluded, and quite consciously excluded from doing my job as an MP\". In parliament By any standards, Ken Livingstone's 12-year parliamentary career has been undistinguished, proof, critics say, of his inability to forge alliances and work with colleagues. For the mayoral race he has the support of eight of London's 57 Labour MPs, including himself; Mr Dobson has 43. Initially coldshouldered by members of the leftwing Campaign group, angry with him for what they saw as his cave-in over capping, Mr Livingstone has failed, as some expected, to take over from Tony Benn as leader of the parliamentary left. Though Mr Livingstone was the Campaign group's choice to run for leader in 1992 - he won the support of only 13 MPs when he needed 55 to make it through to the final ballot - it did not consolidate his position. He shared the ticket with Bernie Grant but, says Mr Grant, \"there was no working together. The Campaign group felt that somebody should put up, make a token gesture - I pulled the short straw - we never went on television together.\" As even his opponents concede, he was given a rude introduction to parliament. The whips ensured he was the last MP to be given an office. He admits detesting Neil Kinnock. But according to some loyalists, attempts were made to take Mr Livingstone on board. \"In 1988 we were planning the local elections and I said we should use Ken,\" said Mrs Hodge. \"[But] he was so hated by all the other people ... I am still of the view that if we had used him then ... I think Ken would have come in board. It was just because he was left outside that he established an alternative agenda ... out of pique and [because] there was nowhere else he could go.\" Both Mr Livingstone and his opponents say the crucial event in his estrangement from the leadership was in 1987, when he joined an attempt to deliver a joint slate for the shadow cabinet elections from the soft left Tribune group and the hard left Campaign group. Tribune group members Gordon Brown and, with an impassioned speech, Jack Straw, repelled the effort. Mr Kinnock said he never considered bringing Mr Livingstone in. \"You knew with Ken that he wouldn't say, 'I recognise the gesture, I'm interested in constructing and therefore I'll get on with it', like a lot of other people did. You knew very well that he would take such an opportunity as a sign of concession, he would exploit it and it would end in grief and there was no point in doing it.\" The Labour leadership \"When we were on the GLC together he did say at various points that he had an ambition to be leader of the Labour party,\" John Carr said. \"He's still got the same glint in his eye, he's still got the same agenda ... Ken believes that in the end the rightwing project as he would call it, the Blairites will fail ... and the rank and file of the party will turn once again to the left and look for a new leader, and Tony Benn's mantle will be resting on Ken's shoulders and he'll be waiting for the call.\" During the 1980s, said David Blunkett, \"Ken did believe at the time, seriously, that the party would turn to him to replace Neil Kinnock. He believed that when we lost the 1987 election, and he believed it again in 1992, that the party would turn to him, and he's never understood yet why that wasn't the case, that the party and the country had moved on.\" Brian Sedgemore offered an alternative take. \"He wanted to be leader of the party. That's an unfulfilled ambition. I don't see, because he hasn't fulfilled his ambition, why London should have to suffer.\"",

The agency quoted Malik Saidullayev, a Moscow-based Chechen businessman who heads the Chechnya state council, as saying the group included \"the best known and authoritative field commanders\".</p> <p>He said the talks were progressing \"with difficulty\" and that it was too soon to identify participants. Those reports add an intriguing twist to the Chechnya war, raising the possibility of a political settlement after weeks of intense fighting.</p> <p>For now, the fighting continues unabated, with Russian commanders reporting that Grozny, already reduced to a charred and ruined shell, could fall within days.

      "bodyText": "Chechen rebel commanders were reportedly holding talks in Moscow today with the Russian government as street battles raged in the centre of Grozny. Russia's Itar-Tass news agency said the talks were taking place under the mediation of a pro-Moscow Chechen body. The agency quoted Malik Saidullayev, a Moscow-based Chechen businessman who heads the Chechnya state council, as saying the group included \"the best known and authoritative field commanders\". He said the talks were progressing \"with difficulty\" and that it was too soon to identify participants. Those reports add an intriguing twist to the Chechnya war, raising the possibility of a political settlement after weeks of intense fighting. For now, the fighting continues unabated, with Russian commanders reporting that Grozny, already reduced to a charred and ruined shell, could fall within days. Lieutenant-general Gennady Troshev told Interfax news agency he believed the military operation could be wrapped up by February 26, although \"nobody is giving the forces any firm deadlines for ending the operation\". Russian predictions, however, have proved notoriously unreliable. Last year, Moscow forecast that the campaign would end at Christmas. Russian forces also said they had captured a bridge across the Sunzha river and Minutka square. Rebel commanders have described the bridge as \"the most strategically important\" site in Grozny as it forms a major transit route for militants moving about the city. But a statement by Chechen fighters on a rebel website insisted that there had been no Russian breakthrough. \"The news regarding Russian troops entering Grozny is not true and the capital remains under our control,\" said Shamil Basayev, commander of the mujahideen, according to Jihad in Chechnya. Another Chechen rebel website, www.kavkaz.org, claims: \"The Chechens are permitting the Russian units to move deeper into the town in order to wipe them out subsequently.\" It adds: \"During the last 24 hours, the Russians lost about 300 men and eight armoured vehicles. The situation in the Chechen capital is under the control of the Chechen government forces.\" Both sides have given conflicting reports of the military successes and casualties since Russia's assault on Chechnya began last autumn.

It will inevitably raise issues about the transparency and accountability of a political system which has changed little since the post-war settlement. But if it is thoroughly conducted, the inquiry should also be able to provide answers to the key questions which Dr Kohl and others have so far ignored: who were the CDU's mystery money-men, and did their cash influence government policies and decisions?

These transactions may represent merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg - and, with Mr Sch\u00e4uble unrepentant, the hunt is on in earnest for more evidence.

These transactions may represent merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg - and, with Mr Sch\u00e4uble unrepentant, the hunt is on in earnest for more evidence. Karlheinz Schreiber, the millionaire businessman whose bundles of used banknotes lie at the heart of the scandal, predicted last November that \"it will become very nasty\" before it is finished. As the CDU's treasurers might have said, you can bet your bottom deutschmark on that.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Stop and search has, at best, had a mixed press, but it's had a bad press for a long time. To move forward, we need to bear in mind the old adage: \"Seek simplicity and then distrust it.\" </p> <p>Reduced to their simplest, we are faced with two opposing arguments: on the left, the power is regarded as unfair, almost to the point of being sinister, while on the right it's seen as something of a panacea for dealing with all crime. </p> <p>Yet a narrow concern for fairness based on superficial assumptions about how \"fairness\" is to be measured risks undermining the effective use of the power to tackle crime. And the impact of this will be unfair in real terms - more victims will come from the poorer sections of communities living in high crime areas and this, in turn, means that the consequence will disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. </p> <p>Until now, the test of fairness has rested on the notion of \"disproportionality\". The fact that ethnic minorities nationally are six times more likely to be searched than whites has been assumed to measure the scale of unfairness. </p> <p>The approach we've adopted at the Metropolitan Police in London is to seek improvements in the use of the tactic but to be led by the evidence, acknowledging that we need to base our action on facts rather than assumptions - whether we like the facts or not. </p> <p>Since April 1998, on seven sites in London we have piloted an intelligence-led approach to establish how much more effective stop and search could be in qualitative and quantitative terms without encouraging officers to fiddle the figures. As reported in August 1999, with the touchstone \"quality not quantity\", additional training, briefing of officers and accountability for their efforts produced real improvements. </p> <p>We increased the searches which resulted in an arrest from 10% to 18% while we reduced the ratio of black people searched relative to whites from 4.4 to 3.3 to 1. </p> <p>However, these promising results left a number of thorny questions. Since the publication of the Lawrence report in February last year, the use of the power has declined by about 50% in London; and an important factor in the reduction of searches has been officers' concerns about being accused of racism. At the same time, crime has increased across the board. Some of the police and the press claimed that the reduction in searches has increased crime. </p> <p>Rather than rush into this speculative and polarised debate, I insisted on pursuing our evidence- based approach, believing that our commitment to the safety of vulnerable communities required us to delve deeper into the issues. We therefore expanded our evaluation of the work on the pilot sites into what we believe is the first major study of its kind in this country. It looks in depth at searches in general, including the link with crime, disproportionality, the reduction in searches and the potential for improvement. </p> <p>The study was undertaken independently by Dr Marian FitzGerald. Among the findings of her report, published in December, was that the apparent disproportionality associated with the tactic was significantly less when allowances were made for demographic factors. </p> <p>For example, once comparisons were limited to the age group most likely to be searched (between 13 and 37) the black: white ratio reduced from 3.3 to 1.6. And the disproportionality reduced even more dramatically if further account was taken of victims' reports of crime suspects. </p> <p>The report also produced some surprising results with regard to t he impact of searches on crime. Forty-seven per cent of arrests for possession of drugs came from searches in 1998/99, rising to 84% in the case of offensive weapons and 95% of going equipped to steal. And analysis undertaken separately by the London School of Economics confirmed that there was a statistical correlation between the fall in searches and the rise in crime at the beginning of 1999. </p> <p>Worryingly, but predictably, this rise in crime has been most severe in inner city areas. Within London, crime rose on average by 24% in five inner city boroughs, compared to only 7% in the suburbs. </p> <p>We cannot afford to withdraw from using the tactic if it penalises the communities most in need of protection - that is, those people (a disproportionate number of whom are from ethnic minorities) who must share the space on streets with those in possession of weapons, drugs, etc. If we do, they will increasingly feel unsafe to use the streets at all. Indeed, stripped of its negative connotations, the theory of broken windows has much to offer in terms of understanding how neighbourhoods decay as minor crime and incivility go unchecked. </p> <p>Stop and search is not a cure-all and it can only be one tool in our armoury for halting this decline. For me, the most powerful messages of the report is that all groups support the police use of the power, provided they use it with respect. </p> <p>The two most salient features of this issue - and indeed in race relations and the criminal justice system more widely - are, first, the complexity of assessing fairness and, second, the dilemmas involved in trying to achieve it. </p> <p>What should be done? First, I believe we need to agree common ground on how we measure fairness, based on more refined notions of proportionality. Meanwhile, the human rights act, which will apply from October, itself enshrines a new concept of proportionality which will require increased vigilance on the part of the police but which may yet prove to be a useful basis for achieving fairness. </p> <p>Second, the Lawrence report recommends providing documentation of the reasons to anyone stopped by the police. This documentation of \"stop and talk\" is currently being tested; and it may prove a less intrusive, more acceptable way for officers to re-engage - and to re-engage with respect - rather than disengage. </p> <p>Third, and this will upset some people, we should consider challenging the low use of searches in crime prone areas. Working with the communities in these areas, we need to work out where the tactic could be used most beneficially on their behalf and this could be included in local crime and disorder plans. Taken together, these approaches may enable us to balance concerns of fairness for people who are searched with fairness to the community as a whole. </p> <p>\u0095 Denis O'Connor is an assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stop and search has, at best, had a mixed press, but it's had a bad press for a long time. To move forward, we need to bear in mind the old adage: \"Seek simplicity and then distrust it.\" Reduced to their simplest, we are faced with two opposing arguments: on the left, the power is regarded as unfair, almost to the point of being sinister, while on the right it's seen as something of a panacea for dealing with all crime. Yet a narrow concern for fairness based on superficial assumptions about how \"fairness\" is to be measured risks undermining the effective use of the power to tackle crime. And the impact of this will be unfair in real terms - more victims will come from the poorer sections of communities living in high crime areas and this, in turn, means that the consequence will disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. Until now, the test of fairness has rested on the notion of \"disproportionality\". The fact that ethnic minorities nationally are six times more likely to be searched than whites has been assumed to measure the scale of unfairness. The approach we've adopted at the Metropolitan Police in London is to seek improvements in the use of the tactic but to be led by the evidence, acknowledging that we need to base our action on facts rather than assumptions - whether we like the facts or not. Since April 1998, on seven sites in London we have piloted an intelligence-led approach to establish how much more effective stop and search could be in qualitative and quantitative terms without encouraging officers to fiddle the figures. As reported in August 1999, with the touchstone \"quality not quantity\", additional training, briefing of officers and accountability for their efforts produced real improvements. We increased the searches which resulted in an arrest from 10% to 18% while we reduced the ratio of black people searched relative to whites from 4.4 to 3.3 to 1. However, these promising results left a number of thorny questions. Since the publication of the Lawrence report in February last year, the use of the power has declined by about 50% in London; and an important factor in the reduction of searches has been officers' concerns about being accused of racism. At the same time, crime has increased across the board. Some of the police and the press claimed that the reduction in searches has increased crime. Rather than rush into this speculative and polarised debate, I insisted on pursuing our evidence- based approach, believing that our commitment to the safety of vulnerable communities required us to delve deeper into the issues. We therefore expanded our evaluation of the work on the pilot sites into what we believe is the first major study of its kind in this country. It looks in depth at searches in general, including the link with crime, disproportionality, the reduction in searches and the potential for improvement. The study was undertaken independently by Dr Marian FitzGerald. Among the findings of her report, published in December, was that the apparent disproportionality associated with the tactic was significantly less when allowances were made for demographic factors. For example, once comparisons were limited to the age group most likely to be searched (between 13 and 37) the black: white ratio reduced from 3.3 to 1.6. And the disproportionality reduced even more dramatically if further account was taken of victims' reports of crime suspects. The report also produced some surprising results with regard to t he impact of searches on crime. Forty-seven per cent of arrests for possession of drugs came from searches in 1998/99, rising to 84% in the case of offensive weapons and 95% of going equipped to steal. And analysis undertaken separately by the London School of Economics confirmed that there was a statistical correlation between the fall in searches and the rise in crime at the beginning of 1999. Worryingly, but predictably, this rise in crime has been most severe in inner city areas. Within London, crime rose on average by 24% in five inner city boroughs, compared to only 7% in the suburbs. We cannot afford to withdraw from using the tactic if it penalises the communities most in need of protection - that is, those people (a disproportionate number of whom are from ethnic minorities) who must share the space on streets with those in possession of weapons, drugs, etc. If we do, they will increasingly feel unsafe to use the streets at all. Indeed, stripped of its negative connotations, the theory of broken windows has much to offer in terms of understanding how neighbourhoods decay as minor crime and incivility go unchecked. Stop and search is not a cure-all and it can only be one tool in our armoury for halting this decline. For me, the most powerful messages of the report is that all groups support the police use of the power, provided they use it with respect. The two most salient features of this issue - and indeed in race relations and the criminal justice system more widely - are, first, the complexity of assessing fairness and, second, the dilemmas involved in trying to achieve it. What should be done? First, I believe we need to agree common ground on how we measure fairness, based on more refined notions of proportionality. Meanwhile, the human rights act, which will apply from October, itself enshrines a new concept of proportionality which will require increased vigilance on the part of the police but which may yet prove to be a useful basis for achieving fairness. Second, the Lawrence report recommends providing documentation of the reasons to anyone stopped by the police. This documentation of \"stop and talk\" is currently being tested; and it may prove a less intrusive, more acceptable way for officers to re-engage - and to re-engage with respect - rather than disengage. Third, and this will upset some people, we should consider challenging the low use of searches in crime prone areas. Working with the communities in these areas, we need to work out where the tactic could be used most beneficially on their behalf and this could be included in local crime and disorder plans. Taken together, these approaches may enable us to balance concerns of fairness for people who are searched with fairness to the community as a whole. \u0095 Denis O'Connor is an assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.",

      "body": "<p>With permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the Government's decisions on the report of the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland, known as the Patten Report after its Chairman, Chris Patten.</p> <p>Of all the issues that have divided society in Northern Ireland, policing is probably the most controversial. In the last 30 years the Royal Ulster Constabulary has faced demands completely unlike those faced by any other force in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the developed world. I would like to place on record the Government's deep admiration for the courage, resilience and professionalism with which the RUC has met these challenges. The accounts I have heard of personal tragedy, pain and loss in the RUC family are profoundly moving and humbling. 302 officers have been killed, and many thousands injured. We all owe the RUC a huge debt of gratitude. The George Cross is a fitting acknowledgement of their sacrifice.</p> <p>But in rising to the challenge, the RUC has inevitably, if unfairly, become identified more with one side of the community than the other. It finds it hard to recruit from the nationalist community and - with 88% of its members Protestant and only 8% Catholic - is not representative of all sides of the community.</p> <p>This is not a desirable state of affairs. The RUC itself is forward-looking and accepts the need for change. It is eager to police a normal society in a normal professional way, but it is held back by the burden of history.</p> <p>The talks which led to the Good Friday Agreement addressed but did not resolve these problems. Instead, Chris Patten and his colleagues were asked to design arrangements for, and I quote:</p> <p>\"a police service that can enjoy widespread support from, and is seen to be an integral part of, the community as a whole.\"</p> <p>The Patten Commission rose to this challenge and I pay tribute to them. Their report covers, among other things, composition, training, culture, ethos and symbols. My Rt Hon friend the Member for Redcar accepted the report in principle, and launched a period of consultation about the details. Since my own appointment, I have met all the interested parties and police groups and have listened carefully to what they had to say.</p> <p>The decisions which I am announcing today will be reflected in legislation which we will bring forward later in this session. In reaching them, I have been driven by, and have tried to keep in balance, three distinct but interdependent considerations:</p> <p>\u0095 representativeness;</p> <p>\u0095 effectiveness;</p> <p>\u0095 respect for the sacrifices of the past.</p> <p>I say \"interdependent\", because only a police service that is accepted and draws members from both traditions and is therefore accepted across the community can hope to be fully effective. And it is only by recognising the sacrifices of the past that we can move forward together to meet the challenges of the future. I am determined that the police in Northern Ireland should be modern, representative and effective, and no longer the fulcrum of antagonistic debate.</p> <p>However, Patten also points out that the implementation of some recommendations will, and again I quote, 'depend to a greater or lesser degree on how the security situation develops', and that judgements will need to be made on how and when they should be introduced. That is advice which the Government will, rightly, keep firmly in mind as we take this process forward.</p> <p><b>Human Rights</b></p> <p>Patten rightly places much emphasis on human rights. The Chief Constable and the new Policing Board together will be made responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive programme of action - including an audit to ensure full compliance with human rights requirements. We also accept a new police oath as proposed by Patten, which will be taken by all new recruits to the police service. I do not believe it appropriate for already attested officers to take the new oath, which would in any case raise significant legal difficulties. All officers will, however, receive human rights training, and will be required to behave in accordance with a Code of Ethics. This Code will be provided for in legislation, and will, like the new Oath, emphasise the priority to be given to human rights.</p> <p><b>Accountability</b></p> <p>The Government accepts Patten's recommendation for the creation of a new Policing Board, composed as the Report recommends, to replace the current Police Authority. The new Policing Board will be responsible for securing the maintenance of an efficient and effective police service and holding the Chief Constable and the police service to account.</p> <p>I am sure the House will wish to join with me in paying tribute to the work of the Police Authority over the last 30 years. Many have served with distinction on the Authority, and were prepared to come forward even when there was a direct terrorist threat against them. Two members of the Authority were murdered by terrorists. The contribution of the Authority, members and staff, will not be forgotten.</p> <p><b>Police planning process</b></p> <p>The Report recommends clarifying the roles of the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable and the Policing Board. The broad thrust of the recommendations is that the Policing Board should play a more developed role - setting objectives, priorities and performance targets while leaving operational control and direction of the police firmly in the Chief Constable's hands.</p> <p>I entirely agree with the Report that the new Policing Board \"should be empowered and equipped to scrutinise the performance of the police effectively\". I therefore accept the recommendations and will introduce legislation accordingly, subject to the Chief Constable continuing to answer to me on all matters involving national security and the work of relevant agencies.</p> <p><b>DPPBs</b></p> <p>Patten proposed the creation of District Policing Partnership Boards to provide an element of local accountability. He envisaged that they should have a primarily consultative role with an ability to monitor police delivery against an agreed local plan, and I endorse this. He also proposed an additional community safety role, with powers to purchase services on top of normal policing. This latter activity is currently a subject being considered by the Criminal Justice Review. Until decisions are taken on this Review, which will be published shortly, I do not intend to extend their function in this way. It will be better, in any case, to concentrate initially on building up relationships at the local level in what I propose to call District Policing Partnerships. I also intend to consider further the arrangements proposed for Belfast, where I am not satisfied that it would be right to have four separate partnerships.</p> <p><b>Style, structure, size and composition of the police service</b></p> <p>Progress on the style of policing and the size of the police service will be critically dependent on the Chief Constable's assessment of the security threat and the public order situation. There will be no question of rushing forward with changes in the absence of a stable security environment. Subject to that overall proviso, in line with the Report, the Chief Constable has decided to re-organise the police service into District Commands based on District Council areas and geared towards policing in partnership with the community. District Commanders will have much higher levels of devolved authority under the overall command of the Chief Constable. The Chief Constable intends that this structural reorganisation will be underway by November this year.</p> <p>The Chief Constable will also re-organise Police Headquarters to produce a slimmer structure. Headquarters will in future take a more strategic approach to management and Special Branch and CID will both be retained and placed under a single Assistant Chief Constable, as the Chief Constable believes is desirable, when the security situation permits.</p> <p>The Government accepts Patten's recommendations on the future size of the police service - that is, a regular complement of 7,500 full-time officers - provided, as the Report says, that the security situation does not deteriorate significantly. We accept Patten's recommendation for the enlargement of the part-time Reserve and the discontinuation of the full-time Reserve - again, subject to the security situation.</p> <p>The severance arrangements to enable serving police officers, whether regular or reservist, to leave the police service will be generous and sympathetic. The Government is committed to finding the necessary resources. Negotiations with the police staff associations are currently in progress. I hope that these discussions will help all sides to agree arrangements which will address the concern which officers understandably have about their future.</p> <p>I attach particular importance to Patten's recommendations for action to transform the composition of the police service, which are essential to gaining widespread acceptability. I endorse the proposal for 50/50 recruitment of Protestants and Catholics, from a pool of candidates all of whom - I stress - will have qualified on merit. We propose that the requirement for this special measure should be kept under review on a triennial basis, with rigorous safeguards to ensure that the, rightly, challenging targets for recruitment do not diminish the standard required of recruits. There will be no question whatsoever of ex-terrorists joining the service.</p> <p><b>Name and symbols</b></p> <p>Madam Speaker, our aim is to develop a police service which is both effective and accepted throughout the community. This aim, as Patten recognises, also clearly bears on the name and symbols of the RUC.</p> <p>The issue here is not whether the name of the RUC is wrong or something not to be proud of. I understand exactly why serving and former officers, their families and indeed widows are proud of the RUC and its name. The issue is whether a change in name, underlining a new start, is a necessary and indispensable part of attracting balance in recruits. Of course it is not the only barrier to recruitment. There has been at times disgraceful intimidation of nationalists who wished to join the RUC. But a change of name was in Patten's view essential, and I agree.</p> <p>That change is needed to signal the new beginning which will, in particular, be symbolised by the arrival in the new training environment of the first recruits entering through the new independent procedures and selected on the new balanced basis. That point will come in the autumn of next year. At that point too, I will therefore bring into force the new title, which will be the Police Service of Northern Ireland, a name which I believe is preferable to that proposed by Patten.</p> <p>At the same time, a service badge incorporating this title will be introduced, after the new Policing Board has had a chance to address the issue. In this context, the RUC will wish to consider how best permanently to record the award to them of the George Cross last autumn. And finally, existing police memorials will remain as they are, and the colour of the uniform will not change.</p> <p><b>IT and Training</b></p> <p>The Government also accepts Patten's important recommendation for IT improvements to put the police in Northern Ireland at the forefront of communications and information technology, and for police training. I am also delighted to tell the House that we have accepted the case for a new Police College, and appropriate resources will be provided. These are in addition to a range of other forward-looking recommendations on practical policing issues, which I will not detain the House by detailing here, which we will also be implementing.</p> <p><b>Oversight Commissioner</b></p> <p>Finally, Patten recommends the appointment of an Oversight Commissioner, to monitor the implementation of those changes agreed by the Government. This appointment will not in any way cut across the responsibilities of either the new Policing Board or the Chief Constable, and the accountability which I and my colleagues have to this House on policing issues will not diminish as a result. The Oversight Commissioner will help create a first rate police service for the future.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>Madam Speaker, the implementation of these changes will entail a major and challenging programme of work for the Government, the Chief Constable, the Police Authority (and in due course the Policing Board) but, most of all, for police officers themselves. It is not an overnight event but a process of change which will extend over several years. I am confident that the police will meet the challenge of change positively and with commitment.</p> <p>For those in the unionist community who have fears, I urge them to accept the need for significant change to create a police service in which all can feel they belong and with which all can identify. To nationalists who have for so long withheld their support from the police in Northern Ireland, I would ask them to reflect on the transformation that is planned and to reconsider their position. It is now time for them to support this programme of change; unambiguously to support the police; and to encourage young men and women from their community to join the police. The prize is a modern, effective police service drawing support and strength from all parts of the community. It is within our grasp. The proposals I have announced today should enable us to achieve it.</p>",

The Tory leader came unstuck as he told the house that Labour's \"failure to be tough on a crime is a cause of crime\" and Mr Blair's promises to increase health spending were fiction. Mr Hague said that there are 1,000 less police officers today than there were at the election, police morale had dropped and crime was rising. \"His pledges to be tough on crime turned out to be worthless pledges turned out to be a worthless aspiration. Is the 5% increase on health a pledge or aspiration?\" he asked Mr Blair. Mr Blair told the Commons that police numbers had fallen under the last government and that crime had doubled. He added that he was \"entirely confident\" that the government would be able to increase spending on the NHS by 5% in real terms over the next five years. Pay rises to nurses last year had led to a 24% increase in recruitment, he said. \"I stand by what I said on the Frost programme,\" Mr Blair said to Tory heckles. Mr Hague accused Mr Blair of failing to clarify whether the government would be giving extra money to the health service or not, and said that Downing Street spokesmen had been giving out different messages. \"Frost on Sunday, panic on Monday, u-turn on Tuesday and waffle on Wednesday,\" he said. He dismissed the prime minister's promise of extra funding for the NHS as a \"piece of rhetoric to get him through the next five days.\" As the row raged on, Mr Blair angrily hit back, accusing the opposition leader of having \"zero judgment\" on health policy. To loud Labour cheers, he added: \"Your policies are a joke. Your party is divided and that is one reason why this country will never trust the Tories with the health service again.\" Mr Blair turned on the Tory plans to make private medical insurance compulsory for non-urgent operations. He said it was a \"ludicrous notion\" for the Tories to claim that the problems of the NHS could be resolved through private medical insurance. The Tories made a promise to cut tax irrespective of economic growth, he said, and were now forced to find a policy to accommodate it. Mr Blair quoted the previous prime minister, John Major, who had said that it was impossible to cut tax as a proportion of GDP without a cut in spending on the health service. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy called on Mr Blair to halt the 1p income tax cut due in April and spend the \u00a32bn thus saved on the NHS. Mr Blair accused the Liberal Democrats of asking him both to reduce the tax burden and to raise taxes. In other questions, the prime minister told the Commons that the repeal of section 28, which prohibits the promotion of homosexuality in schools, would \"free school teachers and others to be able to explain to children properly the facts of life\". He said it was \"a sensible change and a right change\".",

Clearly the guild's founder, John F Andrews, has a wry sense of humour. After praising the 38-year-old Branagh for introducing Shakespeare to a new generation through his films, he goes on: \"In the process Mr Branagh has revived the sagging fortunes of a 435-year-old has-been and turned him into today's hottest screenwriter.\" </p> <p>It is significant that the award is American and is given to Branagh primarily for his movies. In blas\u00e9 Britain, where Shakespeare is still theatrically available and where Branagh-bashing is a popular sport, we have no idea of the impact the Belfast boy's movies have made in the US. I was in Chicago when Branagh's Renaissance Theatre Company was playing King Lear and Midsummer Night's Dream. The theatre was packed with young people, and at a panel on playing Shakespeare, in which Branagh took part, people talked about the Henry V movie with a glowing gratitude you wouldn't find in Britain. Americans, quite simply, have a hunger for Shakespeare which their theatre cannot begin to satisfy. </p> <p>But Branagh doesn't merely have three Shakespeare movies made, with Love's Labour's Lost and Macbeth still to come. He has, in at least two of those cases, created a film that is comparable in linguistic richness and density of texture to a theatrical experience. Praising Branagh for making a movie that is like a play may seem a backhanded compliment, but in a medium where adapting Shakespeare usually involves textual dilution, Branagh has shown you can preserve the values of the original and still make exciting cinema. </p> <p>Filming Shakespeare is always difficult. The Russian director Grigori Kozintsev once summed up the orthodox cinematic view: \"The problem is not one of finding means to speak the verse in front of the camera... The aural has to be made visual. The poetic texture itself has to be transformed into a visual poetry, into the dynamic organisation of film imagery.\" This is easier if you're working in a language other than English; it's what Kozintsev himself did in Hamlet, Kurosawa in Throne of Blood - and Orson Welles in his sequence of Shakespeare movies, by treating the text as if it were in another tongue. </p> <p>Branagh, however, has found a way of preserving the text and yet keeping the film visually alive. In Henry V, Derek Jacobi's Chorus, wandering through the battle-scenes like an ironic commentator, keeps the language constantly in front of us. Contrast the Olivier version, in which the Chorus is gradually reduced to an off-screen voice. Even more remarkable is the Branagh Hamlet, where we get a powerful image of Elsinore as a vast hall of mirrors and a place of imprisoning confinement, and the full four-hour text, which reminds us that the prince is part of a larger pattern. </p> <p>Branagh has preserved the Shakespearean experience and yet produced popular cinema. What we forget, however, is that the Branagh movies, which triggered off a whole new cycle and made Shakespeare cinematically sexy, owe their exis tence to the Renaissance Theatre Company. Read Branagh's premature biography, Beginning, and you discover that, even as he was planning a Renaissance theatre season comprising Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing and As You Like It, he was insisting that filming on Henry V start the second it was finished. The momentum created by the theatre project carried through into the movie. It also helped that Branagh had already played Henry V for Adrian Noble at the RSC and understood the rhythm of the role. </p> <p>In short, Shakespeare on screen often depends on a pre-existing theatrical culture: both Branagh and Olivier used their regular team of actors and even Baz Luhrmann's high-concept Romeo + Juliet was the product of a group who had grown up together at drama school in Sydney. As ever, cinema feeds off theatre. But if Branagh amply deserves his Golden Quill, it is not just for his remarkable chutzpah and energy. It is for showing that you can do Shakespeare on screen without sacrificing his density and richness and without relentlessly transforming the aural into the visual. Imaginatively handled, the aural becomes the visual.</p>",

Mr Trimble said there were only a few police forces with the right to call themselves Royal. \"What precedent is there for removing such an award and is it not regarded as a sign of dishonour?\" he demanded. Mr Blair stressed: \"There is no dishonour intended to the RUC. Their officers have given their lives in outstanding bravery over many, many years. \"What we are trying to do is ensure we have a police service in Northern Ireland that is capable of attracting support from all sides of the community so that it can police better.\" This morning Mr Mandelson had tried to assuage Unionists by arguing that change was inevitable. \"These changes are going to involve pain for the whole RUC family,\" He told the BBC's Today programme. \"I don't want to seem to add insult to injury but I don't believe it is possible to avoid making all these changes, including to the name, if we are going to get the sort of policing we want in Northern Ireland.\" The implementation of the recommendations by former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten is likely to end the honeymoon between Mr Mandelson and the Ulster Unionists. It will also heighten pressure on Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble as he prepares for a crucial meeting of his party's ruling council on 12 February. The council will meet to consider whether the IRA is meeting its commitment to disarm; Mr Trimble has offered to resign if this is not the case. A senior Ulster Unionist warned today that if his party was unable to prevent the Patten report from being implemented, it would call Mr Trimble's leadership into question. David Burnside declared: \"I find what is about to be announced absolutely revolting and I expect the Unionist Party to act accordingly. If David Trimble, John Taylor, Ken Maginnis are not capable as Unionist leaders in defending the name and reputation of the RUC, I think the whole question of their leadership is in doubt.\" The Police Service of Northern Ireland name was agreed after Mr Patten's suggested name of Northern Ireland Police Service was rejected because the government disliked the NIPS acronym.",

      "body": "<p>When I think back to my son Matthew's efforts to teach me to use the internet - this time last year - what I remember best is his tone of voice. It was the same strained, careful tone I take with him when trying to explain why it's not a great idea to wear a stained, wrinkled South Park T-shirt to a job interview, or why many people think it wise to check their account balance before withdrawing money from a hole in the wall. </p> <p>He couldn't believe I didn't know what an icon was, or what you were supposed to do with this icon once you had deciphered it. He paused - was it to count to 10? - when I revealed that I did not know what a home page was, and when I expressed alarm about this hand that kept jumping up at me when I moved the cursor around it. He seemed to age 10 years with every question I asked him. In the end - I think it was just after I had asked him to explain what the two squares at the top labelled Back and Forward were for - his patience snapped. </p> <p>\"What is it with your generation? Why is this so hard for you to accept?\" It took me back to 1972, when I said much the same thing to my mother during a conversation about Bob Dylan's singing voice in Lay Lady Lay. </p> <p>A year later, he and his sister still insist that the internet is the main thing that divides my generation from theirs. \"You're all so afraid of it,\" is how Matthew puts it. \"You treat it like bone china, as if it's going to break if you press the wrong button. But even if you do press the wrong button, what's the big deal?\" </p> <p>He told me about the big deal his father had made a few months ago, after he found out that Matthew had been using his computer to go on the internet without his permission and - possibly because he had pressed the wrong button - crashed the hard disk. \"He wouldn't let me anywhere near it after that. It was so frustrating because if he had, I could have fixed it.\" </p> <p>Of course, when I ask where he acquired all his expert knowledge, he says he can't tell me. \"It's intuitive, I guess. For people of my age, it's second nature.\" </p> <p>He and his sister Emma tell me that the weirdest thing about people my age and the internet, is our reluctance to go off the beaten path. \"You're always telling people how useful it is,\" is how Emma puts it. \"Like, who cares?\" </p> <p>I do have an idea how exasperating I must be to them now that I have tried to explain a few internet functions to my mother and a number of her uncomprehending contemporaries. They get stuck inside riddles like: \"Why is a search engine called a search engine when there is no engine?\" If I treat the internet like bone china, they treat it like a hand grenade. When they click on an icon, they grimace as if they expect the screen to explode in their face.

      "bodyText": "When I think back to my son Matthew's efforts to teach me to use the internet - this time last year - what I remember best is his tone of voice. It was the same strained, careful tone I take with him when trying to explain why it's not a great idea to wear a stained, wrinkled South Park T-shirt to a job interview, or why many people think it wise to check their account balance before withdrawing money from a hole in the wall. He couldn't believe I didn't know what an icon was, or what you were supposed to do with this icon once you had deciphered it. He paused - was it to count to 10? - when I revealed that I did not know what a home page was, and when I expressed alarm about this hand that kept jumping up at me when I moved the cursor around it. He seemed to age 10 years with every question I asked him. In the end - I think it was just after I had asked him to explain what the two squares at the top labelled Back and Forward were for - his patience snapped. \"What is it with your generation? Why is this so hard for you to accept?\" It took me back to 1972, when I said much the same thing to my mother during a conversation about Bob Dylan's singing voice in Lay Lady Lay. A year later, he and his sister still insist that the internet is the main thing that divides my generation from theirs. \"You're all so afraid of it,\" is how Matthew puts it. \"You treat it like bone china, as if it's going to break if you press the wrong button. But even if you do press the wrong button, what's the big deal?\" He told me about the big deal his father had made a few months ago, after he found out that Matthew had been using his computer to go on the internet without his permission and - possibly because he had pressed the wrong button - crashed the hard disk. \"He wouldn't let me anywhere near it after that. It was so frustrating because if he had, I could have fixed it.\" Of course, when I ask where he acquired all his expert knowledge, he says he can't tell me. \"It's intuitive, I guess. For people of my age, it's second nature.\" He and his sister Emma tell me that the weirdest thing about people my age and the internet, is our reluctance to go off the beaten path. \"You're always telling people how useful it is,\" is how Emma puts it. \"Like, who cares?\" I do have an idea how exasperating I must be to them now that I have tried to explain a few internet functions to my mother and a number of her uncomprehending contemporaries. They get stuck inside riddles like: \"Why is a search engine called a search engine when there is no engine?\" If I treat the internet like bone china, they treat it like a hand grenade. When they click on an icon, they grimace as if they expect the screen to explode in their face. There are supposed to be so many people their age going online that in the US they've started calling them Silver Surfers. But I have yet to meet a single silver surfer who can get an email address right. The typical thing is for them to send an email and then ring right away to see if it's arrived.

Not the sort that pits army against army, that sheds blood, destroys economies and bankrupts governments, but what is being called by the US military \"social netwars\". Little noticed and less analysed, they are being taken seriously as the possible style of future conflicts. Already they are beginning to shape the new international and national political agendas. </p> <p>In a series of papers commissioned by the world's most powerful army, the Rand Institute - a leading US government-funded think tank with close links to the White House - has argued that the information revolution now sweeping through most countries is migrating power away from nation states towards new non-governmental alliances and networks of civil organisations. The implications for the way societies develop and the foreign policy of governments may be huge, say the authors, and the threat to established, but particularly authoritarian, regimes may be significant. </p> <p>\"Netwar refers to information-related conflict at a grand level between nations or societies,\" says John Arquilla, one of the report's authors. \"It means trying to disrupt or damage what a target population knows, or thinks it knows, about itself and the world around it. A social netwar may focus on changing public or elite opinion, or both... It may involve diplomacy, propaganda and psychological campaigns, battles for public opinion and for media access and coverage.\" </p> <p>The tone is militaristic, and the report includes the activities of terrorists, criminals and militias, all of whom are using the latest communications to operate, but the broad analysis of the new battle lines between entrenched government and social activism is pretty close to what many in non-governmental organisations are saying. </p> <p>The past 50 years have seen the rise and rise of two new major forces on the world stage: the non-governmental group and the media. The power of the two to change public perceptions is undisputed, but the electronic revolution is now able to bring them together in ways that were inconceivable just a decade ago. The globalisation of capital, business and governanace is being matched by the globalisation of opposition. </p> <p>Huge networks of public interest, environment, human rights, consumer development, religious and umbrella civil society groups, drawing in local, national and international organisations, are beginning to emerge. For the first time they are able to respond immediately to international events, counter state propaganda or bring concerted pressure to bear on governments, companies or international bodies. </p> <p>The most recent netwar was the Seattle world trade talks, where hundreds of diverse groups - often not even present in the city - massively opposed an organisation which very few people in the world had ever heard of, let alone thought about. Through a concerted \"information\" campaign and public protest, they raised a global debate questioning the very legitimacy of the World Trade Organisation. </p> <p>They set an agenda of public disquiet which shocked many western governments and strengthened the arguments of many poor countries who had been prepared to be sidelined. </p> <p>Opposition to the multilateral agreement on investment (MAI), an OECD initiative that sought to rewrite the rules of international investment, is another example of recent netwar. A coalition of several hundred groups sowed confusion and outflanked the governments by picking holes in the arguments, alerting interest groups and demanding accountability. </p> <p>Other netwar arenas include the global grassroots campaign against world debt, started by <a href=\"http://www.jubilee2000.org\" target-_new>Jubilee 2000</a> but picked up across the world; the massive campaign against landmines - the first netwar, the authors note, to have won a Nobel prize; and the international opposition to genetically modified foods. </p> <p>All the issues have very quickly moved on to the international agenda in the past few years, taking governments and industries by surprise. All three have forced climbdowns, new laws and safeguards and caused governments deep embarrassment. The authors anticipate a new global peace and disarmament movement arising \"from a grand alliance among diverse NGO and other civil society actors attuned to netwar\". </p> <p> It is not just governments at risk. Corporations, especially in contentious areas such as oil, mining, banking, chemicals and new biological technologies, are all liable to be \"hit\" - and can do very little to counter the threats posed. </p> <p>The social netwar may also be a fundamental threat to capitalism and neo-liberal economies, the US army has been warned. \"A new generation of revolutionaries, radicals and activists are beginning to create information-age ideologies in which identities and loyalties may shift from the nation state to the transnational level of global civic society. New kinds of actors, such as anarchistic and nihilistic leagues of computer-hacking 'cyboteurs', may also partake of netwar\". </p> <p>The US military, like the British police, has always tended to overstate the case to further its own agendas, but the difficulty they face countering coordinated opposition coming at them from many direct ions is real. \"Old hierarchies have a difficult time fighting networks,\" says the report. \"The Zapatista movement in Mexico, with its legions of supporters and sympathisers among local and transnational NGOs, shows that social netwar can put a democratising autocracy on the defensive and pressure it to continue adopting reforms.\" </p> <p>The report's authors believe that it takes networks to fight networks. \"Governments will have to adopt designs and strategies like those of their adversaries... they must draw on the same principles and [adopt] a willingness to innovate doctrinally.\" And they suggest that the scenes of future social netwars could include Cuba, Nigeria, Russia and Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>Cuban grassroots groups are connecting to outside NGOs. What could emerge before long are the conditions for a fully-fledged social netwar if Cuba becomes more open. In Saudi, the ruling family keeps tight control, but an underground exists and people's access to modern telecommunications is improving. \"Opportunities may grow for an indigenous dissident movement to emerge and gain links to outside fundamentalist and even secular democratic forces,\" says the report. Even a country as closed as Burma may, say the authors, be vulnerable to a social netwar. \"Free Burma\" exile groups have organised into a network to promote the downfall of the junta and to support internal pro-democracy activists. The authors predict that authoritarian regimes may try to harass, control, arrest and expel activists, and regulate the formation and behaviour of NGOs through judicial methods, even creating \"dummy NGOs\". </p> <p>They do not include countries like the US and Britain, which are well-advanced in trying to counter environmental and other activism through all these methods. </p> <p>\"Social netwar is fundamentally anti-establishment,\" say the authors. \"It may be used by leftists, rightists or anyone else with an anti-establishment agenda.\" It is, they conclude, \"more likely to be used against states rather than by them\". </p> <p><strong> How the net was tightened</strong></p> <p><strong> Seattle: </strong> The <a href=\"http://www.wto.org\" target=\"_new\">World Trade Organisation</a> meeting in Seattle was the subject of one of the most intense social netwars yet.

Nevertheless, there has been a broad welcome for the government's initiative in launching the annual social care awards, the first of which will be presented today. </p> <p>Unlike more glamorous professions, or those better placed to attract sponsorship, social care has not had many opportunities to pat itself on the back. And recent events on the national stage have reawakened concern in the statutory social services that ministers may be more interested in highlighting poor practice than in lauding good. </p> <p>John Hutton, social care minister, is anxious to set the record straight on this. \"We want to tell the whole story - the good as well as the bad,\" he says. \"I hope these awards will allow us to do what we have always said we would do, which is to pay tribute to the outstanding work which many people in social care up and down the country do day in, day out.\" </p> <p>The awards are by no means limited to the statutory sector, however. Of 24 shortlisted projects in nine categories, 12 are voluntary sector led and one is from the private sector. Indeed, a common theme of many of the most impressive schemes is truly joined up working, just as the government prescribes. </p> <p>Take the project in the name of Charnwood borough council, Leicestershire, whereby the authority's housing department has appointed a specialist occupational therapist, funded jointly with social services and the NHS, to advise directly on provision for people with particular needs. Although she took up the post only last March, Helen Blakeman can already see attitudes shifting among the housing professionals. </p> <p>\"I have actually watched the change in people who have never thought about disability before,\" she says. \"Our surveyors go out and come back and say: 'By the way, Helen, that house has got a low level shower in it.'\" </p> <p>Or take the project attributed to Nottingham social services, but in fact a joint venture with local police, that has drawn in a raft of charities and street-based organisations to mount a remarkably succcessful drive against juvenile prostitution. No fewer than 89 girls and 36 boys, aged 12-19, have been identified as being involved in prostitution. More than 85% have been steered away from the criminal justice system and a majority have changed their lifestyles. </p> <p>\"Our emphasis now is on moving into preventive work,\" says Sue Gregory, lead officer for the scheme and service manager for child protection with Nottingham city council. \"Children will always be vulnerable and there will always be adults who prey on them.\" </p> <p>Representatives of the short listed projects - whittled down from more than 700 initial expressions of interest - will today attend a reception and lunch at Lancaster House in London. One winner in each category will receive \u00a35,000 and an overall winner will get an additional \u00a35,000, the money to be invested in further service development. </p> <p>The story will not end there, however. A key part of the awards scheme is to spread the good practice being acclaimed, so there will be a special conference in the early spring, supported by the Guardian, at which the winners will present their work to social care profession als from across England. Denise Platt, chief inspector of social services, says: \"We want people to come and celebrate the success of these projects; to listen, discuss and learn from them.\" </p> <p>At least one project would find no problem with that.

of theatre governed by the group's abilities, it's very accessible, very visual, very sensory,\" says Jon Palmer, artistic director. \"The arts are such an appropriate environment for people with learning disabilities to express themselves.\" </p> <p>The group's success has brought considerable reflected glory for its backers, notably the local branch of learning disability charity Mencap and Kirklees council, which put in \u00a320,000 start-up funding. \"I think,\" says Palmer, \"that we have already manoeuvred ourselves into a position where other people need us as much as we need

      "bodyText": "About time too, some may say. Nevertheless, there has been a broad welcome for the government's initiative in launching the annual social care awards, the first of which will be presented today. Unlike more glamorous professions, or those better placed to attract sponsorship, social care has not had many opportunities to pat itself on the back. And recent events on the national stage have reawakened concern in the statutory social services that ministers may be more interested in highlighting poor practice than in lauding good. John Hutton, social care minister, is anxious to set the record straight on this. \"We want to tell the whole story - the good as well as the bad,\" he says. \"I hope these awards will allow us to do what we have always said we would do, which is to pay tribute to the outstanding work which many people in social care up and down the country do day in, day out.\" The awards are by no means limited to the statutory sector, however. Of 24 shortlisted projects in nine categories, 12 are voluntary sector led and one is from the private sector. Indeed, a common theme of many of the most impressive schemes is truly joined up working, just as the government prescribes.

Moreover, she was told that his replacement would probably not perform spinal surgery and, in any event, would not take up his post for about five months. \"Your best bet would be to get your GP to refer you somewhere else,\" Nicole was told. \"Where would you suggest?\" she asked. Nicole discounted the only suggestion she was given - to contact her now ex-consultant through his private secretary for some advice. </p> <p>She decided to make a formal complaint. She hoped that this might help in obtaining the treatment her ex-consultant had originally deemed \"urgent\" when she was placed on his waiting list. She also wanted to highlight the unacceptability of what had happened to her. </p> <p>She received a formal reply from the chief executive of the hospital trust. It was obvious that he had read the newspapers and seen the TV expos\u00e9s - the ones that say patients want apologies and want acknowledgement of wrongdoings.\" </p> <p>Yes, it was quite nice for Nicole to receive an apology, a validation of her argument. But what she really needed was action to remedy the situation. She needs treatment. Her physical problem completely compromises her quality of life; she has been unable to work for 14 months, has no social life and is totally dependent on family and friends for her day-to-day survival. </p> <p>The chief executive's response to Nicole's complaint included a plan for her to be reviewed by a senior orthopaedic consultant three-and-a-half months later. </p> <p>She received no response to her question about what the purpose was of a review by someone who did not perform spinal surgery. Did it indicate a questioning of her original consultant's clinical judgment? If such a review were necessary, why must she wait so long for it? </p> <p>Finally, the time had dragged by. The consultant chosen to review Nicole's case was a knee specialist. He told Nicole that she needed to be seen by someone who specialises in her problem.

Undoubtedly, some other poor patient with a knee problem has had their appointment delayed while the consultant and his registrar took time to tell her that. Nicole was told that they would refer her to another hospital and ask the specialist there to see her as quickly as possible: a month on and she has not yet received an appointment letter. </p> <p> N ot surprisingly, Nicole was dissatisfied. So she asked for an independent review, which is the next stage of the complaints procedure. For this, a convenor - employed by the hospital against which she is complaining - reviews her case with a lay person, who is appointed by the health authority.

Her complaints are justified. </p> <p>Her delight was short-lived. The letter states that the action necessary to remedy matters is not within the powers of the review process. Hence, there is no point in having an independent review. </p> <p>Without any remedy, this is a meaningless victory. Sure, Nicole is pleased that significant recommendations have been made to ensure that no one is \"unfairly condemned\", as the convenor put it, to her situation again. </p> <p>But what about the treatment she needs?

Sure, Nicole is pleased that significant recommendations have been made to ensure that no one is \"unfairly condemned\", as the convenor put it, to her situation again. But what about the treatment she needs? What point is there in having a complaints procedure that has no power to take the action that it rightly identifies would rectify a situation?",

      "body": "<p>How do you eradicate a disease? Just two years ago, a joint campaign to eliminate elephantiasis, the grossly disfiguring disease which is the second leading cause of permanent disability worldwide, was announced by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and SmithKline Beecham (SB), the multinational pharmaceutical company. Long since eradicated from affluent countries, the infection affects more than 120 million people in 80 poor tropical states, with another billion people at risk. Big foot - or big leg, as it is known in many states - produces huge swellings in the arms, breasts and male genital organs too. </p> <p>In the history of man, only one disease has ever been eradicated: smallpox in 1977. Earlier this month in Delhi, WHO launched its final push against polio. It hopes to have eliminated the disease, which has paralysed millions, by the end of this year. A third disease, guinea worm (the \"fiery serpent\"), is on the brink of extinction. Its victims pick up minute crustaceans from contaminated water that grow into thread-like worms slowly and painfully emerging through blisters on the skin. </p> <p>The fourth target, elephantiasis - or lymphatic filariasis (LF) as it is medically known - sounds an easy enough task. Just two drugs, in tablet form, taken once a year for four or five years, would break the transmission. SB is donating up to 5 billion tablets in the next 20 years. The other is a generic drug, DEC, which costs less than $0.01 a tablet. It can't be used in Africa, but Merck, the US pharmaceutical company, has agreed to donate a substitute for that continent, ivermectin, which it is already donating by the million in its river blindness mectizan control programme. </p> <p>If only it was simple. I have been following the people putting the programme together since it was first announced in 1998. Like previous eradication campaigns, it has been a bumpy ride. But tomorrow, at the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in London, the key people in the campaign will be assembled to finally set out their jointly agreed global strategy for this fourth eradication target. </p> <p>It is a daunting task. First is its scale. Smallpox began as a mass immunisation programme but quickly adopted a targeted approach, isolating victims and ensuring just those at risk from contact were vaccinated. Polio only involves vaccination of the under fives. Elephantiasis will need to treat both children and adults - not just the 120 million infected but also the 1 billion at risk. </p> <p>These are among the poorest people in the world. Most are illiterate and many instinctively turn to soothsayers or witchdoctors, not western medicine, for what they perceive to be an affliction of an evil spirit or angry god. Unlike smallpox, it does not threaten the west. More complicated still, people are unaware they have the disease for several years. Until recently, there was only one way of checking: a blood test in the middle of the night - unpopular with health workers as well as communities, many of whom have no electricity. </p> <p>The disease's complicated transmission process was first identified by a British general medical officer, Patrick Manson, serving in the Chinese imperial maritime customs service in the remote port of Amoy in 1877. Manson not only helped in a local Chinese hospital but became fascinated with the pathology of local diseases including elephantiasis. He discovered it was the blood-sucking mosquito which was spreading LF, winning him international aclaim as \"the father of modern tropical medicine\". It led to the identification of a succession of similar transmission cycles: malaria (1898), yellow fever (1900) and dengue (1903). </p> <p>LF is caused by thread-like, parasitic filarial worms, which lodge in the lymphatic system, producing millions of immature microfilaria (minute larvae) that circulate in the blood, but only at night. Mosquitoes feed at night, ingest the larvae with the blood, and proceed to pass them on to new victims at a later feeding session. The new two-drug treatment programme would kill over 99%of the microfilaria within hours, thus breaking the transmission chain. </p> <p>Even before the recent successful combined drug trials, elephantiasis had been identified as potentially eradicable. The International Task Force for Disease Eradication evaluated 94 infectious diseases and, in 1993, selected elephantiasis as one of only six that could be eliminated. There were three main reasons: humans were the only hosts; there was no multiplication of the parasite in the mosquito; the disease's poor transmission system. </p> <p>In May 1997, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution making elimination of LF a public health priority. Later that year, Jan Leschly, SB chief executive, was at a celebration dinner in Washington, sitting next to former US president Jimmy Carter, who had his own foundation campaigning to eliminate diseases. Leschly, whose company had turned down an invitation to take part in London's Dome, was looking for a bigger millennium philanthropic project. He asked Carter if he had any ideas. </p> <p>Next day, Carter called William Foege, the biggest name in global public health, who helped spearhead the smallpox, polio and guinea worm campaigns. Foege was at a scientific meeting of the mectizan programme in France, where news of the success of the first combined drug trial was circulating. There could not have been a more obvious project for SB: their drug was the key player. The single biggest act of corporate philanthropy was underway: a 20-year $1bn commitment from SB. </p> <p>Pharmaceutical companies are currently under attack for the way they are run - driven by share prices, earnings ratios and high drug prices beyond the reach of developing nations. The critics make a powerful case, but so far as SB's philanthropic team are concerned, I have not met a more dedicated or impressive group of professionals. The delay in the launch of the elephantiasis programme has not been caused by SB, which has been straining to get going, but by the bureaucracy of WHO and its reorganisation. Reorganisation was needed, but in abolishing the old tropical disease control division, almost a year was lost. </p> <p>Foege is unequivocal about future eradication programmes: they will only succeed if they can create large coalitions of international organisations, private pharmaceutical companies, voluntary groups and research institutes. </p> <p>In the last two years the elephantiasis team has brought together just such a coalition: three international organisations (WHO, World Bank, Unicef); three private companies (SB, Merck and Amrad, Australia); three national aid agencies (UK, Japan, Italy), plus the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development; eight non-governmental organisations, including the Carter Centre; and nine academic and research organisations, including the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, which is hosting today's launch. </p> <p>What is inspiring is the opportunity opening up to the tiny group of dedicated scientists, who doggedly continued with their research into what was the most unfashionable of diseases, and who now have a chance to launch pioneering eradication programmes. They have limped along on the smallest of grants, in some of the most inhospitable climates, with seemingly little chance of international recognition. At several points, the two biggest research institutions - CDC, the huge Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, and NIH, the National Institute for Health in Washington - came near to cutting off funding. Now all that has changed. </p> <p>Most important of all are the people who it will help. I've met victims in Ghana, Haiti and India. They remain incredibly stoic. They've all suffered grievously: shame, stigma and extreme social exclusion. </p> <p>The psychological consequences of the disease are horrendous: losing its victims jobs, preventing both men and women from marrying, causing severe social isolation through sexual dysfunction and the gross disfigurement of the limbs. Left untreated, the disease produces massive skin folds, fissures and a weeping cauliflower surface that produces a terrible odour. </p> <p>I met young farmers in Haiti, unable to work during acute attacks, and seriously handicapped by the chronic condition. </p> <p>In Ghana, I met Vivian Amoah, 25, who was training to be a financial assistant when her legs began to swell. Initially, she turned to a native herbal healer, who cut her swollen feet with razor blades to insert herbs, only making them worse. She left college and now sells maize, grown by her mother, at a road junction. But she is attending an elephantiasis clinic, where she has learned new techniques to control the swellings. </p> <p>Always regarded as untreatable, the disease has a new challenger. Dr Gerusa Dreyer, who will be speaking at tomorrow's strategy conference, has developed new techniques in Brazil that allow women with the disease to lead normal lives with a simple regime of daily skin inspection and washing to prevent bacterial effects. Men face a more serious problem. She has redefined elephantiasis as a urogenital disease, causing a lifetime of scrotal and testicular swelling in a large proportion of infected individuals. </p> <p>New opportunities for mapping the distribution of the disease have opened up with a simple antigen test, which can be performed with a finger prick drop of blood at any time. Even cheaper means have been pioneered in Ghana, where a senior researcher has successfully used volunteers and health workers to carry out surveys via question naires and random examinations of adult males. </p> <p>The dual drug programme will not only wipe out the disease but bring other health benefits: killing five intestinal worms (albendazole), stopping scabies and killing lice (ivermectin). The delight of the children and their parents I met in Haiti with an early pilot programme was all too obvious. The children were growing faster, sleeping better, much less anaemic and receiving much higher nutrition. </p> <p>Eradication had an unhappy first half of the last century. Until smallpox, there were only failures. The Rockefeller foundation launched a hookworm eradication campaign in 1907 and yellow fever in 1915, but both failed. WHO tried to eliminate malaria and yaws in the late 1950s, but failed. Hence its wariness. Initially, it opposed the smallpox, polio and guinea worm campaigns. </p> <p>Foege remains optimistic: \"Future generations will look back at ours in as much awe at the breakthroughs in disease control as we look back today to the breakthrough in building techniques by the architects of European cathedrals 900 years ago. </p> <p>\"We are creating public health cathedrals which, through diagnostic, treatment and surveillance programmes, will improve all public health programmes.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Malcolm Dean, Society editor, is writing a special independent report on the eradication of elephantiasis for the coalition.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Environment journalists seldom thank government and the NGOs and spend all their time making everyone jump through hoops. But once a year, in a moment of altruism, they invite their meat for a drink. So it was last week that Messrs Prescott, Meacher and Morley among government ministers, Lords de Ramsay and Melchett, the new head of English Nature, and almost everyone in the green NGO establishment descended on the Wig and Pen club in Fleet Street to exact their revenge. </p> <p>It was, indeed, a terrible sight to see the bar bill veer towards \u00a32,000 and so many serious policy analysts, strategists and activists utterly plastered and in each other's arms. Even worse were some of the hangovers the next morning, which might explain a slight pause late last week in the info-babble emanating from government departments, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, the RSPB, among others. </p> <p>\u0095 If the department of the environment has recovered, perhaps someone could investigate what is happening in Flintshire, where Castle Cement proposes to spend \u00a348m on a new toxic waste plant to secure that area of north Wales the title of Waste Capital of Britain. The intention is to burn tyres and other dangerous toxic materials, drawn from all over the Midlands and Lancashire, using a 350-foot chimney to disperse any pollution back over an area about 50 miles to the east.</p> <p> The company, of course, says that no one will be adversely affected, but this is not impressing the people of Chester, just 11 miles away, or any of the nearby communities who have spent years on the receiving end of pollution of the worst order from different industries.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Environment journalists seldom thank government and the NGOs and spend all their time making everyone jump through hoops. But once a year, in a moment of altruism, they invite their meat for a drink. So it was last week that Messrs Prescott, Meacher and Morley among government ministers, Lords de Ramsay and Melchett, the new head of English Nature, and almost everyone in the green NGO establishment descended on the Wig and Pen club in Fleet Street to exact their revenge. It was, indeed, a terrible sight to see the bar bill veer towards \u00a32,000 and so many serious policy analysts, strategists and activists utterly plastered and in each other's arms. Even worse were some of the hangovers the next morning, which might explain a slight pause late last week in the info-babble emanating from government departments, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, the RSPB, among others. \u0095 If the department of the environment has recovered, perhaps someone could investigate what is happening in Flintshire, where Castle Cement proposes to spend \u00a348m on a new toxic waste plant to secure that area of north Wales the title of Waste Capital of Britain. The intention is to burn tyres and other dangerous toxic materials, drawn from all over the Midlands and Lancashire, using a 350-foot chimney to disperse any pollution back over an area about 50 miles to the east. The company, of course, says that no one will be adversely affected, but this is not impressing the people of Chester, just 11 miles away, or any of the nearby communities who have spent years on the receiving end of pollution of the worst order from different industries. With a supine Welsh Assembly, it may be up to Mr Prescott to call the application in as soon as possible. \u0095 The influence Newcastle United football club has exerted on the city council over the years is staggering and so, too, has been the cynicism of the club's directors.

People feared coming out would lead to further discrimination and trouble - such as someone turning up at your doorstep with malicious intent. But now more trans people are prepared to publicly challenge injustice.\" </p> <p>Activists have tended to use the courts as a platform as opposed to direct action because, with only 5,000 UK trans people, it has been difficult to rally mass support. </p> <p>Activists also readily admit that many still fear the consequences of becoming militant - such as appearing in court, where previous names are made public, and facing the ignominy of having their personal lives splashed on tabloid front pages. </p> <p>Yet, in 1997, trans people united publicly for the first time when 50 protesters marched to Downing Street and handed over a 10,000-name petition protesting against Britain's law that their birth certificates cannot be altered once a person changes sex or has \"gender reassignment\" surgery. </p> <p>\"It represented tremendous progress to have got all these trans people on to the streets,\" says Burns. \"Characteristically, trans people have been afraid of public attention.\" </p> <p>In the same year, activists had their first direct confrontation with \"body fascists\". </p> <p>Some neighbours of Stephen Whittle were trying to eject him and his family from the neighbourhood and had organised a \"public meeting\" in a pub to discuss how to get rid of them. But Whittle turned up at the pub accompanied by dozens of supportive neighbours, work colleagues, activists and a TV reporter. </p> <p>\"The bigots had moved on and were nowhere to be seen,\" Burns recalls. \"So we decided not to waste the opportunity and had a jolly good party instead. We challenged unashamed prejudice head-on and we won.\" </p> <p>Despite such progress, Britain remains one of four out of 39 Council of Europe countries which prohibit trans people's birth certificates from being changed. This stems from a 1970 decree of nullity case brought by Arthur Corbett, the heir of Lord Rowallen. </p> <p>Corbett wanted to separate from his wife, the trans model April Ashley, and his family was desperate to avoid handing over any inheritance to her. The court ruled the marriage void because Ashley's birth certificate, which acts as proof of identity, stated that she was a man. </p> <p>\"In effect, the judgment means that, once a person has undergone gender reassignment, they no longer officially exist,\" says Burns. \"The court's decision became the touchstone upon which virtually every aspect of our lives came to be judged. Whether it be claiming benefits or applying for insurance, trans people can end up in all sorts of difficulties if they do not give the name stated on their birth certificate.\" </p> <p>Activists doggedly continue to press the government's interdepartmental working group on trans issues for the right to have their birth certificate changed. </p> <p>And, while the court triumphs have done their bit to reverse discrimination, activists have found an unexpected, but powerful, ally in Coronation Street. Its own male-to-female trans character, Hayley Patterson, presents the first enduring positive image of a trans person to a mass audience and helps erode the idea of trans people as somehow shockingly aberrant. </p> <p>Hayley's marriage and employment problems also mirror those that trans people face in real life, largely because a Press for Change member acts as a personal adviser to actress Julie Hesmondhalgh and the Street's scriptwriters. </p> <p> Granada, the producer of the programme, had first planned to use Hayley as a character for just eight weeks. But such was her popularity that the contract was increased to two years. </p> <p>\"Let's not forget that 18 million people watch Coronation Street,\" says Burns. \"The day-to-day experience of a trans person's life is coming into the living-room of all these viewers, and Hayley's popularity flies in the face of some who even thought that the life of a trans person should not be shown until after 9pm.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Anne is well into her life as a woman. She planned to take the pub which barred her to court for contravening the sex discrimination act. But, last October, the landlady apologised and handed Anne \u00a31,000 compensation in an out-of-court settlement. </p> <p>\"It seems the law was on my side,\" said Anne. \"But I did want the case to go to court to reveal the kind of suffering and prejudice people like me still have to go through.\" </p> <p>It is such resistance which symbolises trans people's stronger united voice. As Whittle says: \"Being trans has been a privilege because I have met wonderful people and have done wonderful things. And I have also been at the forefront of a new political movement that has really challenged the issue of body fascism. </p> <p>\"If we can win the one about trans bodies, then we can win in on all the other battlegrounds surrounding the body - whether it is to do with being fat or thin, able or disabled, black or brown, male or female.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>The foreign office minister John Battle yesterday defended the resumption of British arms sales to Indonesia in spite of the rapidly escalating social unrest, a divided military and warnings from other countries.</p> <p>He urged the world to dispel its long-held view of Indonesia as an unstable, military-controlled state and to welcome the emerging democracy into the international fold.</p> <p>Mr Battle said after two days of talks with Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid and government officials in Jakarta that it was time to get rid of outdated and antiquated views on Indonesia.</p> <p>\"It is not commonly understood internationally that there is a new president elected, that there are new ministers, that there's a programme of reform, and my view is that the government needs to be underpinned in that programme of reform,\" he said.</p> <p>In such circumstances, and in the light of Indonesia's withdrawal from East Timor, he said, there was no reason to reimpose the European Union arms embargo against Jakarta.</p> <p>\"The situation in East Timor has changed massively,\" he said, referring to circumstances four months ago, when the embargo was imposed. \"The TNI [Indonesian military] are not in East Timor, thankfully, and the situation is different. What we're talking about now is a new government that has to cope with the legacy of what went on there.\"</p> <p>However, he stressed that there would be \"no free flow through of arms and no questions asked tomorrow\", because both the EU and Britain had strict codes of conduct regarding arms exports to Indonesia.</p> <p>\"The international community is not going to go away,\" he said. \"It's going to watch the situation and see how the government handles it. It's going to be a case by case basis.\"</p> <p>Britain is one of the biggest arms suppliers to Indonesia. In 1998 Britain exported arms worth \u00a373m to Indonesia.

      "bodyText": "The foreign office minister John Battle yesterday defended the resumption of British arms sales to Indonesia in spite of the rapidly escalating social unrest, a divided military and warnings from other countries. He urged the world to dispel its long-held view of Indonesia as an unstable, military-controlled state and to welcome the emerging democracy into the international fold. Mr Battle said after two days of talks with Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid and government officials in Jakarta that it was time to get rid of outdated and antiquated views on Indonesia. \"It is not commonly understood internationally that there is a new president elected, that there are new ministers, that there's a programme of reform, and my view is that the government needs to be underpinned in that programme of reform,\" he said. In such circumstances, and in the light of Indonesia's withdrawal from East Timor, he said, there was no reason to reimpose the European Union arms embargo against Jakarta. \"The situation in East Timor has changed massively,\" he said, referring to circumstances four months ago, when the embargo was imposed. \"The TNI [Indonesian military] are not in East Timor, thankfully, and the situation is different. What we're talking about now is a new government that has to cope with the legacy of what went on there.\" However, he stressed that there would be \"no free flow through of arms and no questions asked tomorrow\", because both the EU and Britain had strict codes of conduct regarding arms exports to Indonesia. \"The international community is not going to go away,\" he said. \"It's going to watch the situation and see how the government handles it. It's going to be a case by case basis.\" Britain is one of the biggest arms suppliers to Indonesia. In 1998 Britain exported arms worth \u00a373m to Indonesia. In order not to lose future busi ness, British diplomats and arms dealers have regularly courted Indonesian dealers and generals during the embargo period when all links were supposed to have been broken. The Dutch foreign minister, Jozias van Aartsen, who is also in Jakarta, said that when he reports on Indonesia to the EU council of foreign ministers next Monday, \"without any doubt there will be a very positive outlook\". Neither referred to the current state of the military which, after decades as the country's most powerful political force, is now deeply divided over its future role. There is speculation that some generals, particularly those threatened with prosecution over their involvement in East Timor, are plotting a coup. It is widely accepted that barely half of the armed forces support President Abdurrahman and his reform programme. Mr Battle met only one general in Jakarta, the mines and energy minister, Bambang Yudoyhono, who no longer has hands-on control of any troops. Mr Van Aartsen sidestepped questions about whether he trusted the military to respect the civilian government's reform programme. However, with more than a quarter of the country affected by social unrest that the military appears unable to control, Washington is still worried about the situation and refuses to lift its arms embargo until the generals are brought completely to heel. Many other western diplomatic missions in Jakarta share their concern. One diplomat said it was \"pretty irresponsible\" of Mr Battle and Mr Van Aartsen to make judgments without consulting the military high command or considering many other factors. \"The place is in a mess and what is more frightening is that we don't know how bad a mess it is,\" he said. \"The military is even more splintered than it was a year ago, access to this cabinet is worse than to the last cabinet and ministers are running scared and keeping their heads down because they don't know what the president is going to say next.\"",

Normally, the people of the West Indies are near inconsolable when they lose a Test match. Imagine the mood now.</p> <p>The chairman of the selectors, Mike Findlay, released a statement that was unusually harsh for such a mild-mannered man. \"Embarrassing\" was how he described the result. He detected inconsistencies in the batting, bowling and fielding, which made the team pretty useless in any language. He said that \"each member carries a great burden of guilt for having let down [the Caribbean], and subjecting West Indies cricket to tremendous humiliation.\"</p> <p>Greg Kite, the big ponderous basketball forward for the outstanding Boston Celtics team of the 1980s, was once described by a sportswriter as \"five fouls in a uniform\". A West Indian batsman at the crease these days is a slip catch waiting to happen.</p> <p>Chris Cairns certainly thinks so. Much-improved allrounder though he is, he could not have expected 17 wickets in a couple of Tests, to go with a batting average of 51. Nathan Astle's 74 per innings was more than twice his Test career average (36 plus), and the captain Stephen Fleming who averaged 66 in the series, also played well above himself (Test average 38). Even Courtney Walsh suffered. BBC Sport for one stood ready with the phone numbers of everyone from the Jamaican prime minister down, if, as expected, he broke Kapil Dev's bowling record in New Zealand. Those calls are on hold. Walsh fell well short of the 11 wickets he needed, taking only three very expensive ones. Of the Caribbean bowlers, only Reon King had a good series, taking eight wickets. King, whose style has been compared to Michael Holding, is the only one who seems ready to take over from those amazing old men, Walsh and Ambrose. Mervyn Dillon and Franklin Rose, once The highly regarded, have gone backwards.</p> <p>The batting? Lara's once-stratospheric average could slip below 50 by year's end. It's now just above 51 and fast heading south. That's still an astonishing record, but it's not if you're Brian Lara. On the plus side, they seem to have found a gutsy, spirited player in the left-handed opener Adrian Griffith. Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who answered to that description a year ago, has become unreliable and his game is riddled with error. Another previously dependable leftie, Jimmy Adams, now looks shot.</p> <p>The next Test series is against Zimbabwe, ranked ninth out of nine in the Wisden World Championship.

The West Indies won only a single one-day match out of seven, and lost all five Tests. Yet that tour was successful compared to the one they have just completed, on which they lost every single international - two Tests and five one-day internationals against New Zealand. Normally, the people of the West Indies are near inconsolable when they lose a Test match. Imagine the mood now. The chairman of the selectors, Mike Findlay, released a statement that was unusually harsh for such a mild-mannered man. \"Embarrassing\" was how he described the result. He detected inconsistencies in the batting, bowling and fielding, which made the team pretty useless in any language. He said that \"each member carries a great burden of guilt for having let down [the Caribbean], and subjecting West Indies cricket to tremendous humiliation.\" Greg Kite, the big ponderous basketball forward for the outstanding Boston Celtics team of the 1980s, was once described by a sportswriter as \"five fouls in a uniform\". A West Indian batsman at the crease these days is a slip catch waiting to happen. Chris Cairns certainly thinks so. Much-improved allrounder though he is, he could not have expected 17 wickets in a couple of Tests, to go with a batting average of 51. Nathan Astle's 74 per innings was more than twice his Test career average (36 plus), and the captain Stephen Fleming who averaged 66 in the series, also played well above himself (Test average 38). Even Courtney Walsh suffered. BBC Sport for one stood ready with the phone numbers of everyone from the Jamaican prime minister down, if, as expected, he broke Kapil Dev's bowling record in New Zealand. Those calls are on hold. Walsh fell well short of the 11 wickets he needed, taking only three very expensive ones. Of the Caribbean bowlers, only Reon King had a good series, taking eight wickets. King, whose style has been compared to Michael Holding, is the only one who seems ready to take over from those amazing old men, Walsh and Ambrose. Mervyn Dillon and Franklin Rose, once The highly regarded, have gone backwards. The batting? Lara's once-stratospheric average could slip below 50 by year's end. It's now just above 51 and fast heading south. That's still an astonishing record, but it's not if you're Brian Lara. On the plus side, they seem to have found a gutsy, spirited player in the left-handed opener Adrian Griffith. Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who answered to that description a year ago, has become unreliable and his game is riddled with error. Another previously dependable leftie, Jimmy Adams, now looks shot.

Her faces registers deep and profound shock. \"Jeffrey?\" she stammers. \"What are you doing?\" The Raja turns to face her, stoicism etched into his face: it's time to come clean. \"I'm a superhero, mother\", he begins. \"An effete British superhero, to be precise. And I'm pilfering your silverware because I hurl it. I hurl it with deadly accuracy. The Blue Raja is my name and, yes, I know I don't wear much blue, and I speak with a British accent, but if you know your history, it really does make sense...\" He trails off; his mother stands before him, her jaw hanging open. \"Anyway, the point, mother, is that your son's a limey fork-flinger. Ha! Hard cheese to swallow I know, but there it is.\" The Raja feigns indifference to the gravity of the situation. \"What will the bridge club think, eh mother?\" The shock begins to fade from his mother's eyes, to be replaced by a warm glow of maternal warmth. Finally she speaks. \"You need more forks?\" See also: Psycho, The Manchurian Candidate, Carrie Don't see also: Stop!

The Pope clinched the first triumph of the Vatican's holy year with a bravura performance which astonished observers, who had expected a shuffling, ailing pontiff. Looking down at the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and Orthodox church leaders, the 79-year-old electrified his audience with an unscripted shout of \"Unity! Thank you!\" He arrived at the basilica of St Paul's Outside the Walls with a brisk step instead of being wheeled on the mobile platform he is normally forced to use because of his difficulty in walking. Speculation that the Pope might step down was revived when the National Catholic Reporter, a US magazine, published a long-standing rumour that he had written a resignation letter to be activated if he became senile. But papal aides were jubilant at having scored a \"double whammy\" by demonstrating John Paul's robustness during one of the holy year's most significant events. John Paul symbolised his dream of healing division among Christians by pushing open the door of St Paul's with the help of Dr Carey and Metropolitan Athanasios, who represented Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians. \"It was a total triumph for the Pope.

A consensus is emerging that for a variety of reasons, the Pope's successor is likely to be either an Italian or a Latin American. But the growing ambition of John Paul's travel plans confirms the Vatican's confidence: trips to Egypt, Israel and Portugal, plus an invitation to Brazil under consideration. Margaret Hebblethwaite, a theologian and Vatican expert, said yesterday's performance would bolster those advising the Pope to cling on - despite his pain and the suspected Parkinson's disease which is thought to cause his trembling and slurred voice. \"The advisers are sycophants and they will never tell him to retire.

      "bodyText": "Crime on the internet is driving the biggest growth area in illegal activity in England and Wales, fraud and forgery, which has risen by 29% or 70,000 offences in the past year, according to the latest official crime figures published yesterday. Apart from the 19% rise in street robberies in inner cities, the increasing volume of credit card fraud on the internet has pushed crime figures up for the first time in six years. The head of home office research, Paul Wiles, said yesterday that although some of the 29% increase was due to increased reporting and changes in the counting rules, cyber-crime was increasing. This marked the first official acknowledgement that credit card fraud was a significant emerging problem after months in which the banks, credit companies and eletronic retailers have scorned media \"scare stories\" and insisted that fraud on the net was a minor problem. The banking industry's credit card research group has shown that although the internet was only responsible for 2% of all credit and debit card transactions it now generated 50% of all complaints. Most cover cases where people have ordered the wrong goods by accident or where retailers do not put their publicly recognised names on credit card statements, but they also involve genuine cases of fraud. They ranged from be ing charged for goods or services never received to the worst cases when credit card numbers are sold to other fraudsters. Anthony Abrahams of the Canadian-based Fraud Watch, said the problem was that credit cards were designed to be used for face to face transactions not for deals over the net or telephone. Safeguards - such as signatures, magnetic strips and holograms - were of little help in cyberspace. He suggested that their best virtue was probably the \u00a350 limit on an individual's liability if caught up in fraud.

      "body": "<p>Asked if we love our children, few of us would be backward in coming forward. Asked which of us would sacrifice our legal right to hit our own children, a swingeing 70% of parents would apparently put their hands down. </p> <p>A friend told me the story of taking his five-year-old daughter up to bed. She immediately came downstairs, so he smacked her and took her back up. Down she came again, so he smacked her harder, and took her up again. Within minutes she was downstairs. At this point he knew he would literally have to beat her into submission or think of something else. Luckily for her - for both of them - he realised there must be another way. </p> <p>The British Medical Journal recently reported a large-scale Canadian survey in which adults who had been slapped or spanked as children were twice as likely as those who had not to have alcohol or drug problems and to show antisocial behaviour. The point is this: even if it were only the teeniest, hardly measurable bit harmful, why would we want to take the risk with those we love most? </p> <p>The United Nations convention on the rights of the child, ratified by the UK in l991, says: \"State parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence...\" </p> <p>It is puzzling, therefore, that freshly into the 21st century we still sanction violence towards children and even plead for its continuance. It is a very simple question: \"should children have the same right not to be hit as adults have?\" And yet it is a proposition that throws us into immediate panic. Partly, it seems, from reluctance to condemn ourselves or our parents for actions that appeared absolutely correct at the time. But we can move forward. Many grandparents I know who did hit their children wouldn't dream of hitting their grandchildren. </p> <p>Children's rights have always proceeded very slowly.

      "bodyText": "Asked if we love our children, few of us would be backward in coming forward. Asked which of us would sacrifice our legal right to hit our own children, a swingeing 70% of parents would apparently put their hands down. A friend told me the story of taking his five-year-old daughter up to bed. She immediately came downstairs, so he smacked her and took her back up. Down she came again, so he smacked her harder, and took her up again. Within minutes she was downstairs. At this point he knew he would literally have to beat her into submission or think of something else. Luckily for her - for both of them - he realised there must be another way. The British Medical Journal recently reported a large-scale Canadian survey in which adults who had been slapped or spanked as children were twice as likely as those who had not to have alcohol or drug problems and to show antisocial behaviour. The point is this: even if it were only the teeniest, hardly measurable bit harmful, why would we want to take the risk with those we love most? The United Nations convention on the rights of the child, ratified by the UK in l991, says: \"State parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence...\" It is puzzling, therefore, that freshly into the 21st century we still sanction violence towards children and even plead for its continuance. It is a very simple question: \"should children have the same right not to be hit as adults have?\" And yet it is a proposition that throws us into immediate panic. Partly, it seems, from reluctance to condemn ourselves or our parents for actions that appeared absolutely correct at the time. But we can move forward. Many grandparents I know who did hit their children wouldn't dream of hitting their grandchildren. Children's rights have always proceeded very slowly. It was the factories act of l833 which stopped children having to work more than 10 hours a day. Next they were prevented from having to go up chimneys - no doubt to choruses of \"but how will we clean the chimneys\". Amazingly it wasn't until l944 that all children got the statutory right to education, but it still took until l986 - barely 15 years ago - to stop them being physically punished in schools.

He also took a call on his mobile phone from a very senior - and very angry - member of the government trying to discover what was happening. </p> <p>Tony Blair, marooned in Chequers on that frantic Friday night in the late autumn of 1997, was desperate to discover what was being briefed to newspapers about the euro. </p> <p>Unable to get hold of Gordon Brown, the chancellor, or Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's official spokesman, Mr Blair tracked down Mr Whelan. The chancellor's spin doctor, in a show of respect for the PM, put down his white wine spritzer and left the Red Lion to speak in privacy. </p> <p>Mr Blair had been tipped off by Peter Mandelson, then minister without portfolio in the cabinet office, that an interview with the chancellor in the next day's Times would harden the existing \"wait and see\" line. His decision to call Mr Whelan suggests that he was in the dark about the timing of the shift and possibly even the precise line. </p> <p>Mr Whelan, overheard briefing reporters in the Red Lion by a Liberal Democrat researcher, let slip the secret call in a speech to a Royal Bank of Scotland dinner in London. \"Blair couldn't get hold of anybody. Campbell had gone awol and Gordon Brown was doing his constituency surgery,\" said Mr Whelan, who is now co-presenter of Radio 5 Live's Sunday Service programme. </p> <p>\"One day I might tell exactly what he said. Someone at GCHQ will have a tape of it. He was not a happy bunny. The only person I spoke to on my mobile phone that night out side the Red Lion was the PM.\" </p> <p>Mr Whelan may have been unusually reticent about what was discussed, but a former minister was more forthcoming: \"Charlie told Blair: 'Sorry, mate, it's too late'. The PM will never forget how he heard his government's European policy had been announced to the world.\"</p>",

Charlie Whelan, then treasury press secretary, admitted it was not only journalists he spoke to from the Whitehall pub to announce that Britain would not join the single currency in this parliament. He also took a call on his mobile phone from a very senior - and very angry - member of the government trying to discover what was happening. Tony Blair, marooned in Chequers on that frantic Friday night in the late autumn of 1997, was desperate to discover what was being briefed to newspapers about the euro. Unable to get hold of Gordon Brown, the chancellor, or Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's official spokesman, Mr Blair tracked down Mr Whelan. The chancellor's spin doctor, in a show of respect for the PM, put down his white wine spritzer and left the Red Lion to speak in privacy. Mr Blair had been tipped off by Peter Mandelson, then minister without portfolio in the cabinet office, that an interview with the chancellor in the next day's Times would harden the existing \"wait and see\" line. His decision to call Mr Whelan suggests that he was in the dark about the timing of the shift and possibly even the precise line. Mr Whelan, overheard briefing reporters in the Red Lion by a Liberal Democrat researcher, let slip the secret call in a speech to a Royal Bank of Scotland dinner in London. \"Blair couldn't get hold of anybody. Campbell had gone awol and Gordon Brown was doing his constituency surgery,\" said Mr Whelan, who is now co-presenter of Radio 5 Live's Sunday Service programme. \"One day I might tell exactly what he said. Someone at GCHQ will have a tape of it. He was not a happy bunny. The only person I spoke to on my mobile phone that night out side the Red Lion was the PM.\" Mr Whelan may have been unusually reticent about what was discussed, but a former minister was more forthcoming: \"Charlie told Blair: 'Sorry, mate, it's too late'. The PM will never forget how he heard his government's European policy had been announced to the world.\"",

      "body": "<p>A decision by Egypt's ministry of culture to publish an Arabic translation of a book by the Israeli author David Grossman has sparked a war of words in a country that has officially been at peace with Israel for 20 years. </p> <p>The \"coldness\" of that peace and the continuing debate in Egypt about the nature of ties with Israel have been highlighted by the objections to the book, even though Grossman is generally regarded as sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians. </p> <p>Yellow Wind includes interviews with Palestinians in the West Bank in 1987 to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1967 Middle East war in which the Arabs lost the West Bank and Gaza Strip to Israeli occupation. </p> <p>The fact that the book was translated into Arabic by a Palestinian who was commissioned by Beir Zeit university, a West Bank institute strongly associated with Palestinian nationalism, has also failed to silence the culture ministry's detractors. </p> <p>They argue that publishing a book by an Israeli author constitutes premature normalisation - the term for practical matters such as trade, easy travel, diplomatic recognition, academic exchanges and individual contacts with Israel. </p> <p>The book has now been handed over to an Egyptian researcher who has just published a weighty tome on Zionism. He has been given the task of deciding whether it is safe to unleash the book on the Egyptian public and may write an introduction aimed at uncovering whatever hidden Zionist ideology lurks within. </p> <p>Esmat Kandeel, a managing editor at the culture ministry who gave the initial go-ahead for the Arabic translation to be published, said those who criticised her decision were missing the point. </p> <p>\"It's a beautiful book that paints a very painful picture of life under occupation for the Palestinians. I wish everyone would read it,\" she said. </p> <p>\"The people who have criticised the decision to publish the book haven't even read it. The only reason they object is because it's a book by an Israeli. It's a kind of terrorism. They want us to close our eyes and ears and stay ignorant forever.\" </p> <p>Egypt became the first Arab country to sign peace with Israel in 1979 but its citizens remain wary of the Jewish state. Egyptians rarely visit Israel, professional unions forbid dealings with it and opposition parties repeatedly urge the government to suspend the peace treaty. </p> <p>Organisers of the annual Cairo book fair and international film festival refuse to invite Israel, and opposition newspapers survive on a staple diet of Israeli conspiracy theories. </p> <p>But Israel seems more eager to embrace Egyptian culture. The Friday evening Egyptian film on Israeli television has been a staple for many years and most Israeli bookshops carry Hebrew translations of the works of Egypt's Nobel prize-winning author Naguib Mahfouz. </p> <p>Wahid Abdel-Meguid, a political analyst at the Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, said: \"The defeated side is always more sensitive than the victorious one. </p> <p>\"Egyptian cultural circles are still not used to dealing with Israeli culture. They feel the conflict is not over and that peace has not been realised and that whatever comes from Israel is loaded with the position and point of view of Israel and leads to furthering its interests, and this causes them to recoil.\" </p> <p>Mohammed Madbouli Mohammed, the owner of Madbouli bookshop in central Cairo, sees nothing wrong with selling books by Israeli authors. </p> <p>\"What's wrong with knowing the enemy? They buy all our books. We must pay attention and read and see what this enemy is doing,\" Mr Mohammed said. \"We are in a truce right now, we should take advantage of it by seeing how the enemy lives. </p> <p>\"We must congratulate whoever thought of translating this book. They are not collaborators, they wanted to give us an insight into these people's way of thinking.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A decision by Egypt's ministry of culture to publish an Arabic translation of a book by the Israeli author David Grossman has sparked a war of words in a country that has officially been at peace with Israel for 20 years. The \"coldness\" of that peace and the continuing debate in Egypt about the nature of ties with Israel have been highlighted by the objections to the book, even though Grossman is generally regarded as sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians. Yellow Wind includes interviews with Palestinians in the West Bank in 1987 to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1967 Middle East war in which the Arabs lost the West Bank and Gaza Strip to Israeli occupation. The fact that the book was translated into Arabic by a Palestinian who was commissioned by Beir Zeit university, a West Bank institute strongly associated with Palestinian nationalism, has also failed to silence the culture ministry's detractors. They argue that publishing a book by an Israeli author constitutes premature normalisation - the term for practical matters such as trade, easy travel, diplomatic recognition, academic exchanges and individual contacts with Israel. The book has now been handed over to an Egyptian researcher who has just published a weighty tome on Zionism. He has been given the task of deciding whether it is safe to unleash the book on the Egyptian public and may write an introduction aimed at uncovering whatever hidden Zionist ideology lurks within. Esmat Kandeel, a managing editor at the culture ministry who gave the initial go-ahead for the Arabic translation to be published, said those who criticised her decision were missing the point. \"It's a beautiful book that paints a very painful picture of life under occupation for the Palestinians. I wish everyone would read it,\" she said. \"The people who have criticised the decision to publish the book haven't even read it. The only reason they object is because it's a book by an Israeli. It's a kind of terrorism. They want us to close our eyes and ears and stay ignorant forever.\" Egypt became the first Arab country to sign peace with Israel in 1979 but its citizens remain wary of the Jewish state. Egyptians rarely visit Israel, professional unions forbid dealings with it and opposition parties repeatedly urge the government to suspend the peace treaty. Organisers of the annual Cairo book fair and international film festival refuse to invite Israel, and opposition newspapers survive on a staple diet of Israeli conspiracy theories. But Israel seems more eager to embrace Egyptian culture. The Friday evening Egyptian film on Israeli television has been a staple for many years and most Israeli bookshops carry Hebrew translations of the works of Egypt's Nobel prize-winning author Naguib Mahfouz. Wahid Abdel-Meguid, a political analyst at the Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, said: \"The defeated side is always more sensitive than the victorious one. \"Egyptian cultural circles are still not used to dealing with Israeli culture. They feel the conflict is not over and that peace has not been realised and that whatever comes from Israel is loaded with the position and point of view of Israel and leads to furthering its interests, and this causes them to recoil.\" Mohammed Madbouli Mohammed, the owner of Madbouli bookshop in central Cairo, sees nothing wrong with selling books by Israeli authors. \"What's wrong with knowing the enemy? They buy all our books. We must pay attention and read and see what this enemy is doing,\" Mr Mohammed said. \"We are in a truce right now, we should take advantage of it by seeing how the enemy lives. \"We must congratulate whoever thought of translating this book. They are not collaborators, they wanted to give us an insight into these people's way of thinking.\"",

      "body": "<p>True to our national tradition as the last country in Europe to ban corporal punishment in schools, ministers made a glacial move yesterday to providing children with more protection from their parents. They were required to do so after the European Court of Human Rights ruling in 1998 on a stepfather who had severely and repeatedly beaten his stepson with a three-foot pole, but was found not guilty by a jury because of the old Victorian defence of \"reasonable chastisement\". The case could not have been a clearer breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, which outlaws inhuman and degrading treatment, but it moves the debate on to the politically more difficult ground of a parental right to smack. Labour ministers, already oversensitive to Tory charges of nanny state tendencies, reacted robustly to the Strasbourg ruling. Paul Boateng was as insistent as Virginia Bottomley, in a 1994 version of this debate, that \"smacking has a place in parental discipline. Our law will do nothing to outlaw smacking.\" </p> <p>When he issued a deeply unsatisfactory consultation document yesterday, the latest minister charged with handling the issue, John Hutton, did at least produce a more intelligent defence of parental rights. \"We accept and protect the rights of parents to discipline children within the proper framework of the criminal law,\" he said, \"and we are trying to do that in a way that is not intrusive and wouldn't criminalise perfectly ordinary parents who are doing a very difficult job in bringing up their children.\" The minister has ruled out the abolition of the \"reasonable chastisement\" defence as an impractical, unenforceable and unjustifiable intrusion into family life. This is a respectable position, but only if ministers are ready to produce a modern definition of the Victorian concept, which was set out by a chief justice in an era when parents were even more authoritarian in their approach to child rearing than Paul Boateng. </p> <p>The problem with the document is that it leaves the definition to the courts. But it was the courts which found the stepfather in the 1998 case not guilty in the first place. It sets out four open ended criteria (context; duration; physical and mental effects; and sex, age and health of the victim) with no further definition. This is far too vague. What prosecutors - and parents - require is something far more specific. Good law requires certain and predictable boundaries.</p>",

They can not hold out in the besieged city for long.\" The fresh onslaught followed strategic shifts on both sides at the weekend. The previous ground offensive to take Grozny, launched on Christmas Eve, had to be aborted due to guerrilla successes. Meanwhile the Chechens announced that they were abandoning attempts to hold territory in favour of hit-and-run tactics. Despite yesterday's fierce ground fighting, it may be that the Chechens are opting to leave the city to the Russians and will then harry the occupying army through ambushes and raids. Yesterday's developments showed how little heed the Russians are paying to outside criticism - the drive to take Grozny coincided with a visit to the region of a delegation from the Council of Europe, led by Lord Russell-Johnston, which is to consider suspending Russian membership of the organisation at a special session next week. The onslaught also coincided with the first public Russian appeal for a halt to the war. The Union of Committees of Soldiers' Mothers accused Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president and prime minister, of violating international conventions on the conduct of war by attacking civilians. They accuse Moscow of covering up the true number of Russian casualties. Mikhail Gorbachev, yesterday contradicted the official line by stating that there would be no quick end to the war and that the situation could be much worse in six months. \u0095 An artillery shell exploded yesterday outside the supreme court building in Nazran, the regional capital of Ingushetia, but it caused no casualties.",

But, just for the record, the Financial Times Editor, Richard Lambert, was mistaken in Monday's Guardian. I refer, of course, to the Roy Greenslade piece about the Sun's attack on the FT (Oi! Mind your own business, Media, January 17). He told the excellent Mr Greenslade that the Wall Street Journal did not break the Time Warner-AOL story. He said it was a \"Dow Jones wire story\".</p> <p>For the record, it was a Journal exclusive. The paper's LA bureau had the story and I believe the New York-based editors decided to put it out on their wire service (Dow Jones owns the WSJ) and online.</p> <p>Surely in this digital cyber-era, Mr Lambert is not going to quibble about this? After all, these days a scoop is a scoop whether delivered in electronic or print form. Maybe the FT should have reacted quicker and bunged it on FT.com. Meanwhile, thanks for the coverage.</p> <p><b>David Yelland </b><br> Editor, the Sun</p> <p>\u0095 It was reported that what irked Richard Lambert, the FT's editor, was \"the fact that the leader was based on a somewhat false premise in that it was Dow Jones Newswires rather than [its sister organisation] the Wall Street Journal which beat the world to the AOL story\". This premise was not, in fact, false at all. Whilst the story did run on Dow Jones Newswires first, then on CNBC and wsj.com, the scoop was got by the Journal's Los Angeles bureau chief who, primarily for reasons of timing (it was midnight his time, 8am London time), decided to give the scoop to Dow Jones Newswires. By most people's judgement, this was, and remains, a Journal scoop.</p> <p>It is not by any means the first time that a Journal scoop has run on Dow Jones Newswires, nor will it be the last. One of the advantages of having a truly global news gathering network of some 1,650 reporters and editors is that if a news story breaks at an \"inconvenient\" time in one part of the world, we at Dow Jones have other highly efficient ways through our various print, electronic and TV operations of getting the news out those parts of the world that are awake and trading.</p> <p><b> Brigitte Trafford</b><br> Dow Jones</p>",

But, just for the record, the Financial Times Editor, Richard Lambert, was mistaken in Monday's Guardian. I refer, of course, to the Roy Greenslade piece about the Sun's attack on the FT (Oi! Mind your own business, Media, January 17). He told the excellent Mr Greenslade that the Wall Street Journal did not break the Time Warner-AOL story. He said it was a \"Dow Jones wire story\". For the record, it was a Journal exclusive. The paper's LA bureau had the story and I believe the New York-based editors decided to put it out on their wire service (Dow Jones owns the WSJ) and online. Surely in this digital cyber-era, Mr Lambert is not going to quibble about this? After all, these days a scoop is a scoop whether delivered in electronic or print form. Maybe the FT should have reacted quicker and bunged it on FT.com. Meanwhile, thanks for the coverage. David Yelland Editor, the Sun \u0095 It was reported that what irked Richard Lambert, the FT's editor, was \"the fact that the leader was based on a somewhat false premise in that it was Dow Jones Newswires rather than [its sister organisation] the Wall Street Journal which beat the world to the AOL story\". This premise was not, in fact, false at all. Whilst the story did run on Dow Jones Newswires first, then on CNBC and wsj.com, the scoop was got by the Journal's Los Angeles bureau chief who, primarily for reasons of timing (it was midnight his time, 8am London time), decided to give the scoop to Dow Jones Newswires. By most people's judgement, this was, and remains, a Journal scoop. It is not by any means the first time that a Journal scoop has run on Dow Jones Newswires, nor will it be the last. One of the advantages of having a truly global news gathering network of some 1,650 reporters and editors is that if a news story breaks at an \"inconvenient\" time in one part of the world, we at Dow Jones have other highly efficient ways through our various print, electronic and TV operations of getting the news out those parts of the world that are awake and trading.

Arms inspectors have been barred from returning to Iraq since leaving in mid-December 1998, shortly before the US and Britain launched the four-day air campaign Desert Fox. A foreign office source suggested Mr Annan may have used Mr Ekeus as a stalking horse and that he can now turn to China and Russia with an alternative candidate who has the same arms monitoring credentials but no past involvement in Iraq. A possible alternative is Pasi Patokallio, the Finnish ambassador to Israel and Cyprus. Mr Annan has the power to nominate candidates but endorsement requires the approval of UN security council members. China, which has a permanent seat on the council, sent a letter yesterday to the president of the security council saying Beijing had \"difficulty going along with the nomination\", and asking that other candidates be considered. Russia sent a similar letter on Monday. The French foreign ministry spokesman, Fran\u00e7ois Rivasseau, also questioned Mr Ekeus's suitability: \"It is doubtful that someone who has presided over this special commission for six years can represent this will, this necessity for renewal and change.\" Britain and the US believe that Iraq is harbouring chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them, and wants to send a team into Iraq to check. Iraq denies having the arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, and wants the sanctions lifted, claiming they cause distress to ordinary civilians. Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, said: \"How can they form a new commission and then name its former head to lead it?\"",

Calling himself James Dando and saying he lived at her house in Fulham, west London, the man telephoned the gas, electricity and water companies to try to have her bills transferred into his name. He seemed to possess confidential details, including the 14-digit number of her electricity account. A direct debit form from British Gas marked Mr J Dando was sent to the television star and she filled in the details without noticing anything was amiss. The calls to the utilities were made between 6.31pm and 6.49pm on Sunday February 1 last year, the day after Ms Dando held a party at a restaurant in Chiswick to celebrate her engagement to gynaecologist Alan Farthing. Detective Chief Inspector Hamish Campbell, who is leading the murder hunt, described two other instances of stalking behaviour before Ms Dando was shot on the doorstep of her home in Gowan Avenue on April 26. On November 22 1998, someone used an internet service, 192.com, to pinpoint exactly where she lived: 192.com is an online directory inquiries service, using data from the electoral roll to provide callers with details of addresses and maps of the area for a small fee. Ms Dando's ex-directory telephone number was not on the website. However, a caller who rang British Telecom last April did have her private number and tried to persuade a BT operator to switch her account details into his name.

A UN proposal on the rights of the child, being negotiated in private in Geneva this week, is seen as an important signal, with an estimated 300,000 child soldiers, mainly in African conflicts, recruited or kidnapped by governments as well as rebel groups. An existing UN convention sets 18 as the age of transition to adulthood with one exception - participation in war, where the age limit is 15. The government is sticking to existing British rules with 16 as the minimum age for voluntary recruitment and 17 for deployment, though it says an age limit of 18 should be set for recruitment by rebels or \"non-state actors\", and all forcible recruitment or conscription of children should be outlawed. A coalition of non-governmental organisations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, is accusing Britain and the US of double standards. Both countries are also opposed to bringing the ban under the remit of the proposed international criminal court. A deal expected this week is likely to allow countries to opt out of the agreement.",

      "bodyText": "A Chilean air force jet was last night on standby at an airfield 1,000 miles north of Santiago ready to extract the former dictator Augusto Pinochet from his 15-month enforced exile in Britain. Pinochet and his supporters, and human rights groups around the world, are facing an anxious wait after the deadline for submitting objections to Jack Straw's announcement that he was minded to halt extradition proceedings on medical grounds expired at 5pm yesterday. The home secretary is expected to make his final decision in the next seven days. \"Once we've seen the size of the representations and the nature of the arguments then we'll give an indication of when it is likely that I'll announce a decision,\" Mr Straw told BBC radio's The World At One. In London Amnesty International and the other human rights groups protesting at Mr Straw's provisional announcement delivered their submissions to the home office yesterday morning. The representations include claims that the general could have been faking dementia during his medical tests and that the team which examined the general did not include anyone with specific expertise in dementia. In letters accompanying the submissions, Robert Howard, of the Institute of Psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital in London, and Nori Graham, president of the International Alzheimer's Society - both eminent old-age psychiatrists - stated that the medical tests to which Pinochet was apparently subjected were insufficient to arrive at a diagnosis of dementia. Dr Howard said the medical team \"cannot be considered to have established beyond doubt that he is unfit to stand trial\". \"If Pinochet recovers it will not be an indictment of the doctors who examined him, but it will be an indictment of Jack Straw,\" Pierre San\u00e9, Secretary General of Amnesty, said at a press conference in London. In Strasbourg the European Court of Human Rights rejected a request by seven Chileans, now living in Spain, that Britain be stopped from sending General Pinochet home. They argued that they or their families suffered under his rule. The court gave no reason for the decision but an official in Strasbourg said an injunction would have been granted had the plaintiffs managed to convince the tribunal that release \"would have caused grave and irreparable harm\" to their lives. Switzerland said yesterday it had decided against requesting a new British medical examination for Pinochet but added that it did not consider health grounds a legal reason to decide against extradition. The Swiss extradition request for the former Chilean dictator followed a criminal complaint filed in Geneva by the widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean dual nationality who disappeared in Argentina in May 1977.",

Horne's most high profile protest - at the government's refusal to announce a royal commission on vivisection in line with a pre-election pledge - ended in December 1998 without the government ceding any significant ground. Horne also faced claims - fiercely denied by supporters - that he had been secretly taking orange juice and sugary tea throughout the hunger strike. Horne is serving an 18-year sentence following an Animal Liberation Front firebomb attack in the Isle of Wight, which caused \u00a33m damage. Last year appeal court judges rejected his claim that the conviction was unsafe and the sentence too long.

Apparently, museums are above funfairs in the popularity stakes, but below discos ...</p> <p>\"We need to break free from the idea that museums are constrained by physical walls. We need to demonstrate our relevance to local communities by taking collections out of museums and putting them into schools, shops and other locations. If visiting a pub is our favourite pastime, why not recognise that by exhibiting our collections in one?\"</p> <p>Information technology was changing the world beyond recognition, he said. \"In my own field, book publishing, I can say that any print-based publisher who does not embrace the electronic revolution will be out of business in 10 years time.\"</p> <p>Mr Evans warned that museums, if they were to continue to exist, must embrace change and work with one another and with other institutions in the sector.</p> <p>\"Some museum professionals live in outmoded professional boxes that sometimes prevent them from working with similar types of organisation. For example, there is in my view a quite ridiculous sniffiness among museums about recognising the contributions made by essentially similar bodies such as science centres or heritage trusts, let alone archives or libraries. There is little hope of a new future if these attitudes persist.\"</p> <p>Mr Evans dynamic approach received a nervous welcome from many museum professionals, who nevertheless pointed out a few practical problems.</p> <p>\"We're there, we're doing it,\" Dr Simon Thurley, director of the Museum of London, said. \"We haven't got a pub yet, but that's only a matter of time.</p> <p><b> Daring displays</b><br></p> <p>\"We've got objects displayed, many at the sites where they were found, in London Bridge railway station, in offices, in schools, in the Royal Opera House - it's only a question of how daring you can be, in making excellent management arrangements and designing a case that somebody can't just come up and smash with a hammer.</p> <p>\"But apart from security considerations, I think the very best and most important objects are always going to be in the main museums, because that's where the big stories can be told. \"</p> <p>Maurice Davies, deputy head of the Museums Association, which represents the country's thousands of registered museums - but not heritage centres or science centres - said: \"I'd like to throw the challenge back to Matthew Evans - what the sector is crying out for is clear, simple, coherent guidance and leadership from this new body. Small under-resourced museums are facing bewildering choices and possible changes of direction, and don't know where to turn, and they haven't been given enough help in the past.\"</p> <p>\"It's easy to criticise - now we want to see what he can do about it.\"</p> <p>Mr Davies added: \"As for Matthew's Marks and Spencer remark - I tried to get into their new year sale the other day and the shop was so crowded I couldn't.\"</p> <p>Ironically, in one of its final publications, the museums and galleries commission yesterday issued figures which justified much of Mr Evans's gloom. Museum Focus 2, which looks at trends in museums between 1997 and 1998, found:</p> <p>\u0095The number of visits to museums dropped by 4% nationally</p> <p>\u0095The number of permanent full-time staff fell by 116, 2.5%, to 12,590 - though this was offset by a 20% increase in volunteer numbers, to 25,206.</p> <p>\u0095Almost three quarters of museums feel that in-house conservation work is insufficient, and more than 90% contract out some conservation work.</p> <p>\u0095Almost half of all museums, 49%, now charge for admission to core collections.</p> <p>\u0095Only 51% of museums offer facilities or services for people with disabilities, though the number of museums with a disability policy increased by 8% to 29%.</p> <p>On the more optimistic side:</p> <p>\u009580% of museums have shops and toilets and 35% a restaurant or cafe.</p> <p>\u0095Opening hours are increasing; 40% open for more than 40 hours a week in summer, and 62% open for more than 10 months a year.</p> <p>\u0095Although most of most museums' collections are in store, almost all, 98%, can now provide some access to stored material, either by opening stores to visitors or lending to other museums or exhibitions, or to schools and community centres.</p> <p><b>'We know we have to move with the times'</b></p> <p><b> Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery:</b></p> <p>\"The National Gallery has for many years aimed to find new ways of making its collection fully available to the public, wherever they may live.</p> <p>\"We maintain the importance of free admission and have pioneered access to the collection through new media. It was the first collection to be available on CD-rom, had the first ever touchscreen information room and has a website which received 21m hits in 1999.\"</p> <p><b> Mark O'Neill, director Glasgow museums:</b></p> <p>\"I agree with everything Matthew Evans says, but he almost makes it appear that people in the industry don't know it. Of course you have to move with the times... you have to embrace information technologies, but you still have to stress the experience of visiting a museum.</p> <p>\"The combination of the building, the objects and the other visitors there to see them is unique and very important.\"</p> <p>\"Having said that, you have to reach out and we do that. We do 1,000 loans a year to non-museum venues such as community centres, prisons and shopping centres.\"</p> <p><b> Dr Robert Anderson, director of the British Museum:</b></p> <p>\"Today museums must be dynamic organisations and respond imaginatively to audience expectations.</p> <p>\"The British Museum attracts some 6m visitors a year, but our activities are by no means confined to our London base. For example, last year more than 9,000 objects were lent to nearly 100 venues around the UK. Compass, our new multimedia collections database, which will be launched this year, is a prime example of how museums are harnessing modern technology.\"</p> <p><b> Patrick Greene, president of the Museums Association, director of the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester:</b></p> <p>\"I agree that there is a need for museums to reach out, to be as open and welcoming to visitors as possible, but I think Matthew Evans will find he's talking to the converted, or at least the semi-converted.</p> <p>\"At Manchester we've increased attendances by 28% through going out and putting on special events.</p> <p>\"In the last two years we've had a dinosaur exhibition and a show about the science of Star Trek, and they were crowd pleasers.</p> <p>\"These events are justified, providing they're well-researched and accurate, because once people come in for a particular show, they realise that we've got loads of other good exhibits.\"</p> <p><b> Eddie Gershon, spokesman for the JD Wetherspoon pub chain:</b></p> <p>\"Having museum exhibits in pubs is a bit off the wall, but not impossible. We already commission more original works of art and sculpture from local artists and sculptors than any other pub company. We spend around \u00a3250,000 a year. We make a point of going to local artists, so why not do the same with local museums?\"</p> <p>\u0095Interviews by Paul Kelso</p>",

Apparently, museums are above funfairs in the popularity stakes, but below discos ... \"We need to break free from the idea that museums are constrained by physical walls. We need to demonstrate our relevance to local communities by taking collections out of museums and putting them into schools, shops and other locations. If visiting a pub is our favourite pastime, why not recognise that by exhibiting our collections in one?\" Information technology was changing the world beyond recognition, he said. \"In my own field, book publishing, I can say that any print-based publisher who does not embrace the electronic revolution will be out of business in 10 years time.\" Mr Evans warned that museums, if they were to continue to exist, must embrace change and work with one another and with other institutions in the sector. \"Some museum professionals live in outmoded professional boxes that sometimes prevent them from working with similar types of organisation. For example, there is in my view a quite ridiculous sniffiness among museums about recognising the contributions made by essentially similar bodies such as science centres or heritage trusts, let alone archives or libraries. There is little hope of a new future if these attitudes persist.\" Mr Evans dynamic approach received a nervous welcome from many museum professionals, who nevertheless pointed out a few practical problems. \"We're there, we're doing it,\" Dr Simon Thurley, director of the Museum of London, said. \"We haven't got a pub yet, but that's only a matter of time. Daring displays \"We've got objects displayed, many at the sites where they were found, in London Bridge railway station, in offices, in schools, in the Royal Opera House - it's only a question of how daring you can be, in making excellent management arrangements and designing a case that somebody can't just come up and smash with a hammer. \"But apart from security considerations, I think the very best and most important objects are always going to be in the main museums, because that's where the big stories can be told. \" Maurice Davies, deputy head of the Museums Association, which represents the country's thousands of registered museums - but not heritage centres or science centres - said: \"I'd like to throw the challenge back to Matthew Evans - what the sector is crying out for is clear, simple, coherent guidance and leadership from this new body. Small under-resourced museums are facing bewildering choices and possible changes of direction, and don't know where to turn, and they haven't been given enough help in the past.\" \"It's easy to criticise - now we want to see what he can do about it.\" Mr Davies added: \"As for Matthew's Marks and Spencer remark - I tried to get into their new year sale the other day and the shop was so crowded I couldn't.\" Ironically, in one of its final publications, the museums and galleries commission yesterday issued figures which justified much of Mr Evans's gloom. Museum Focus 2, which looks at trends in museums between 1997 and 1998, found: \u0095The number of visits to museums dropped by 4% nationally \u0095The number of permanent full-time staff fell by 116, 2.5%, to 12,590 - though this was offset by a 20% increase in volunteer numbers, to 25,206. \u0095Almost three quarters of museums feel that in-house conservation work is insufficient, and more than 90% contract out some conservation work. \u0095Almost half of all museums, 49%, now charge for admission to core collections. \u0095Only 51% of museums offer facilities or services for people with disabilities, though the number of museums with a disability policy increased by 8% to 29%. On the more optimistic side: \u009580% of museums have shops and toilets and 35% a restaurant or cafe. \u0095Opening hours are increasing; 40% open for more than 40 hours a week in summer, and 62% open for more than 10 months a year. \u0095Although most of most museums' collections are in store, almost all, 98%, can now provide some access to stored material, either by opening stores to visitors or lending to other museums or exhibitions, or to schools and community centres. 'We know we have to move with the times' Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery: \"The National Gallery has for many years aimed to find new ways of making its collection fully available to the public, wherever they may live. \"We maintain the importance of free admission and have pioneered access to the collection through new media. It was the first collection to be available on CD-rom, had the first ever touchscreen information room and has a website which received 21m hits in 1999.\" Mark O'Neill, director Glasgow museums: \"I agree with everything Matthew Evans says, but he almost makes it appear that people in the industry don't know it. Of course you have to move with the times... you have to embrace information technologies, but you still have to stress the experience of visiting a museum. \"The combination of the building, the objects and the other visitors there to see them is unique and very important.\" \"Having said that, you have to reach out and we do that. We do 1,000 loans a year to non-museum venues such as community centres, prisons and shopping centres.\" Dr Robert Anderson, director of the British Museum: \"Today museums must be dynamic organisations and respond imaginatively to audience expectations. \"The British Museum attracts some 6m visitors a year, but our activities are by no means confined to our London base. For example, last year more than 9,000 objects were lent to nearly 100 venues around the UK. Compass, our new multimedia collections database, which will be launched this year, is a prime example of how museums are harnessing modern technology.\" Patrick Greene, president of the Museums Association, director of the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester: \"I agree that there is a need for museums to reach out, to be as open and welcoming to visitors as possible, but I think Matthew Evans will find he's talking to the converted, or at least the semi-converted. \"At Manchester we've increased attendances by 28% through going out and putting on special events. \"In the last two years we've had a dinosaur exhibition and a show about the science of Star Trek, and they were crowd pleasers. \"These events are justified, providing they're well-researched and accurate, because once people come in for a particular show, they realise that we've got loads of other good exhibits.\" Eddie Gershon, spokesman for the JD Wetherspoon pub chain: \"Having museum exhibits in pubs is a bit off the wall, but not impossible. We already commission more original works of art and sculpture from local artists and sculptors than any other pub company. We spend around \u00a3250,000 a year. We make a point of going to local artists, so why not do the same with local museums?\" \u0095Interviews by Paul Kelso",

      "bodyText": "Nobody said blackmail was easy but there is one basic rule: contact your victim. Sound obvious? Apparently not, if the bizarre case involving New Zealand actor Russell Crowe, star of LA Confidential, is any indication. A cunning plot was hatched after Crowe was involved in a punch-up at an Australian nightspot last November. Club owners Phillip Cropper and Malcolm Mercer discovered their security video had captured the fracas, and planned to extract $132,000 from Crowe in return for the tape. It seems, however, they never actually got in touch with the actor. The budding criminal masterminds came unstuck when they were overheard discussing the plan with a rugby coach who they wanted to help \"convince\" Crowe to stump up the cash. The pair's original brainwave, it seems, had been to sell the tape to the media, with Mercer optimistically suggesting it would \"ruin Crowe's fuckin' credibility\" in the run-up to the Oscars. The actor is tipped to receive a nomination for his role in the upcoming The Insider. Sadly, nobody thought to point out to Mercer that serial hell-raising is these days a virtual prerequisite for nomination hopefuls (as Sean Penn and Robert Downey Junior could confirm). Both Cropper and Mercer are charged with conspiring to extort, conspiring to pervert justice and conspiring to hinder an investigation. Crowe has made no comment. Meanwhile, back in the infinitely more civilised Los Angeles, Kelly LeBrock (best remembered from 1985's dire teen-sci-fi romp, Weird Science) has settled a lawsuit with her managers. Following the first rule of Hollywood - if at first you don't succeed, then sue - LeBrock issued a writ after an attempt to market her own line of homeopathic medicines went down the pan. As per usual in such cases, a settlement was reached before the case arrived in court, and LeBrock is presumably now free to resume her \"acting career\".",

It's easy to sneer at the show's success, but impossible to dismiss it: the last series drew audiences of seven million. This is no mean feat when you consider that most of us would do almost anything to avoid the circumstances depicted in the programme. </p> <p>It was business as usual at Birmingham Children's Hospital: seven-year-old Nicole had sustained head injuries in a motorway accident, 12-year-old Lisa was waiting for a hole-in-the-heart operation, and tiny three-hour-old Sam had been born with his innards hanging out of a hole in his stomach, a knotty, livid mass. The surgeons got to work, the distraught parents wept, and the patients (at least those who were conscious) showed almost unbelievable pluck. As the programme wore on, one could only wonder why seven million people would voluntarily subject themselves to such harrowing viewing. This isn't, after all, a kid-glove handling of the subject, despite what the syrupy title music may suggest: the images of tiny children strapped into terrifying machines, with gloved hands manipulating their intestines, are the stuff of nightmare. The fact that this material is shown pre-watershed simply compounds the mystery. </p> <p>It's impossible not to get caught up in so much suffering humanity, nor to fail to admire the health professionals who deal with this stuff every day of their working lives - but to watch it for enjoyment? Hopefully the hospital benefits from the publicity that a prime-time BBC1 slot generates, but other than that it's difficult to understand the show's raison d' tre. The success of Children's Hospital, Animal Hospital, Pet Rescue and any show in which vulnerable creatures suffer and die suggests that the nation is in the grip of a mass outbreak of Munchausen's syndrome by proxy. </p> <p>There was more voluntary suffering after the news, as dozens of seemingly sane men, women and children volunteered to spend a year on a desolate Hebridean island in <strong> Castaway 2000</strong> (BBC1). Four thousand people answered a recruitment advert; 200 of these were interviewed as potential residents for the windswept, storm-lashed island of Taransay. The bulk of last night's programme - the first of four covering the selection process - followed the wannabe Crusoes through a series of painful and disgusting exercises. Herding sheep proved beyond them, while emptying the compost sewage system (the \"stuff\" looked like anaemic Christmas pud) had them heaving in the bushes. A star was born in the handsome shape of Ben Fogle, a posh 25-year-old who emerged as an instant leader and all-round good guy. Happy the campers in his team; for the rest of them, the experience was a hideous blend of Lord Of The Flies and The Blair Witch Project. Three more shows (tonight and next week) complete the selection procedure; the \"lucky\" winners are now experiencing January on Taransay. </p> <p>BBC2's <strong> Graham Greene: The Beginning Of The End Of The Affair</strong> delved into the murky personal circumstances behind the composition of Greene's 1951 masterpiece. The peg for this illuminating trot through the blasted heath of Greene's psyche is the forthcoming Neil Jordan film of the book, starring Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore as the writer and his lover. The story was closely based on Greene's own relationship with Catherine Walston, a beautiful, restless (and married) American woman; Greene conducted the affair and transmuted it into fiction simultaneously. Walston's son Oliver proved a strangely gung-ho guide to his mother's infidelities. More sensible reactions came from daughter Anne (\"I don't like Greene's books\") and Walston's sister Belinda, who chastised her nephew for his over-eagerness. </p> <p>Greene emerged as an endlessly fascinating figure, a Christian who could only feel the full depth of his faith when he was deliberately sinning.

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone has been secretly approaching high-profile individuals in the capital to gauge their willingness to stand as independent candidates for the Greater London assembly in a bid to build a power base if he becomes mayor. If he lost the Labour nomination to Frank Dobson, those individuals would clearly be seen as his allies if he mounted an independent challenge for the job. But people approached by Mr Livingstone or intermediaries say that even if he wins Labour's endorsement, he is concerned about the amount of control that would be exerted on him by the Labour group - made up of Blairites chosen by Millbank - in the assembly. His calculation is that a group of independent but pro-Livingstone assembly members could hold the balance of power. Under the new system of London government, the 25-strong assembly is designed to provide a check on the mayor. But, as Mr Livingstone told his biographer, John Carvel, he calculated it would be possible to be an effective mayor with the support of nine GLA members, because a two-thirds majority of assembly members is needed to veto the mayor's budget. One of those sounded out, Tony Travers of the London School of Economics, said: \"I talked to Ken in a way that he led me to believe that he was interested in testing out the idea of whether it would be possible to get individuals to stand as independents, to stand outside political parties as an independent group in the assembly.\" Mr Travers said it would be \"difficult not to infer\" that he was being invited by Mr Livingstone to put his name forward, but he shrugged off the approach. Mr Livingstone also suggested the names of Simon Jenkins, the former Times editor, and Sir Peter Hall, professor of planning at University College, London. Mr Jenkins said last night: \"In the course of conversations with Ken, I was aware that he was worried about his possible support in the assembly and he was floating the idea of a list of independents who would be kind of Ken Livingstone backers other than Blairite backers - in other words an alternative group in the assembly. \"I understood that I was one of a group of people who he mooted to others might be persuaded to stand and might not be unhelpful to him. He never asked me directly and I can't imagine myself standing.\" Sir Peter Hall said that he had never been approached by Mr Livingstone. But he added: \"Someone said to me months ago that Ken Livingstone was going around saying you might be an independent candidate for the GLA and I just found the whole thing fantastic that I discounted it. I've never had anything to do with Ken Livingstone and I'm certainly not a Ken Livingstone supporter.\" Mr Livingstone last night denied that he had sounded out Mr Travers about running for the GLA. \"What I said to Tony Travers was I hoped he'd come and be part of my administration and he declined.\" But Mr Jenkins confirmed the idea had been \"strictly to do with the assembly\". The revelation casts further doubt on Mr Livingstone's public insistence - repeated yesterday - that \"under no circumstances\" would he run as an independent for mayor. Ballot papers to select Labour's candidate go out next Wednesday and the result is expected to be announced a few days after the vote closes on February 16. Nomination papers for Greater London assembly candidates will not be sent out by the returning officer until March, with the closing date in early April. The election proper is on May 4. Downing Street yesterday seized on Mr Livingstone's comments to the Face magazine that he supported \"direct action\" and would put the World Trade Organisation in \"vast stocks\" so people could throw things at its officials. Frank Dobson called the remarks \"irresponsible\" and \"disturbing\". Mr Livingstone yesterday dismissed the comments as \"a series of one-line gags\".",

      "body": "<p>It was fun while it lasted, a euphoric honeymoon when the astonishing pace of political change left everyone a little flummoxed. Now it is time to wake up.</p> <p>Today Peter Mandelson will implement Chris Patten's controversial report on the RUC, virtually in full. He is expected to announce a minor concession on the crown-and-harp badge and to signal an important brake on the proposed local policing boards, with the aim of averting paramilitary involvement. But the name will go. So too, eventually, will the Special Branch.</p> <p>That will cut down Ulster Unionists' already limited scope for manoeuvre on that other spectre stalking the new dispensation. February 12 is the crunch date. That Saturday David Trimble, first minister, reconvenes his 860-strong Ulster Unionist Council to take stock of its decision to enter government immediately with Sinn Fein, in anticipation of quick IRA decommissioning. He has said he will resign if he is unable to report any such move on arms.</p> <p>Back in November he calculated he would lose unless he made the promise. And there was a reason why he selected February. He believes he had a private deal with Sinn Fein that IRA decommissioning would start in January, so allowing General John de Chastelain, head of the Independent Commission on Decommissioning, to so report later this month.</p> <p>The verbal assurances are said to have come in a meeting involving only five people toward the end of ex-US senator George Mitchell's review of the Good Friday Agreement. Along with Mitchell, those present were Trimble, his lieutenant Sir Reg Empey and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Sinn Fein vehemently denies any secret deal. But the clear belief among those who took part in the Mitchell review was that IRA decommissioning would come during January.</p> <p>Opinion has swung around over the past two months. At meetings in the US, leading republicans Pat Doherty and Martin Ferris appeared to throw doubt that decommioning was imminent. Last month, Sunday papers claimed in stories apparently inspired by Downing Street that decommissioning would start by January 16. Ten days ago, they said the general had been invited to witness a symbolic destruction of some IRA weaponry, and would then oversee the sealing of arms dumps.</p> <p>But sources close to General de Chastelain say he was left mystified by these tales: the IRA had given him nothing to support any such claim. He had already sounded cautious in his December 10 report, just after he first met the IRA go-between, suggesting he would lay down a start date if paramilitaries failed to do so. He is thought since to have had a second meeting with the IRA.</p> <p>He also insists his mandate means destruction of weapons, and that the British and Irish governments would have to bring forward new legislation if \"sealing\" arms dumps was to be an option. The Northern Ireland Office disagrees and that will have to be settled.</p> <p>Gerry Adams has adopted a belligerent tone recently, demanding David Trimble show leadership and berating him for setting his own deadline for decommissioning. That was to be expected, for republicans want to wring as much as possible from the Patten report and Peter Mandelson's expected announcement on cutting the army's presence.</p> <p>Adams and McGuinness have adopted an analogy which throws doubt over the IRA's intentions. They say that the boat of inclusive democracy is only now setting sail with all on board; anyone who jumps off will surely drown.</p> <p>David Trimble said Sinn Fein would attract worldwide condemnation if the IRA subsequently failed to decommission. The new metaphor indicates a real truth: that he will somehow be blamed if the executive collapses should the IRA refuse to play ball.</p> <p>Sinn Fein is happy enough with the confusion. It improves its short-term negotiating position, and it also helps to reduce the likelihood of more defections from the IRA.</p> <p>There has been none of the explicit conditioning of republican grassroots that there was ahead of the agreement; there is no information from the security forces suggesting that decommissioning is imminent. Yet there is a perception within mainstream republicanism that decommissioning is coming.</p> <p>One senior provisional said there had been a deliberate policy of avoiding any internal debate, fostering the false impression that opposition was minimal. He felt those against decommissioning had been cleverly out-manoeuvred, with the leadership successfully pleading with them to stick with the peace process until it was too late to oppose it.</p> <p>There is bitterness within the IRA. Some members feel the leadership is prepared to jettison many of them because Sinn Fein's electoral strength is now republicanism's real strength. Opponents of decommissioning appear to be left with nowhere to go. Most dismiss the Real IRA, responsible for the Omagh bombing, and agree there can be no return to war.</p> <p>This all may point to IRA decommissioning taking place, but the only deadline republicans recognise is May, the aspirational date in the agreement for the completion of the Good Friday process. It seems highly unlikely a start will be made by February 12, with Sinn Fein and the IRA furious at what they see as Trimble's unilateral approach.</p> <p>Last week in the Commons, the Northern Ireland secretary talked tough, saying an early move is necessary if decommissioning is to be completed in four months. He was careful to mention no deadline other than May's.</p> <p>Unless General de Chastelain is able to break good news later this month, David Trimble is faced with little option but to make good his promises to his party. That would signal a return to the old certainty of uncertainty, and the demise of the now flourishing agreement. All over an issue which is about faith, not weapons.</p> <p>John Mullin is the Guardian's Ireland correspondent</p> <p><b> Decommissioning countdown</b> <br><b> Good Friday 1998:</b> timetable agreed <br><b> Today:</b> future shape of Royal Ulster Constabulary announced <br><b> January 31/February 1:</b> General de Chastelain due to report on arms removal <br><b> February 12:</b> UUP's council meets to decide on staying in new executive <br><b> May 22:</b> final date for \"all paramilitaries\" to decommission</p>",

But the name will go. So too, eventually, will the Special Branch. That will cut down Ulster Unionists' already limited scope for manoeuvre on that other spectre stalking the new dispensation. February 12 is the crunch date. That Saturday David Trimble, first minister, reconvenes his 860-strong Ulster Unionist Council to take stock of its decision to enter government immediately with Sinn Fein, in anticipation of quick IRA decommissioning. He has said he will resign if he is unable to report any such move on arms. Back in November he calculated he would lose unless he made the promise. And there was a reason why he selected February. He believes he had a private deal with Sinn Fein that IRA decommissioning would start in January, so allowing General John de Chastelain, head of the Independent Commission on Decommissioning, to so report later this month. The verbal assurances are said to have come in a meeting involving only five people toward the end of ex-US senator George Mitchell's review of the Good Friday Agreement. Along with Mitchell, those present were Trimble, his lieutenant Sir Reg Empey and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Sinn Fein vehemently denies any secret deal. But the clear belief among those who took part in the Mitchell review was that IRA decommissioning would come during January. Opinion has swung around over the past two months. At meetings in the US, leading republicans Pat Doherty and Martin Ferris appeared to throw doubt that decommioning was imminent. Last month, Sunday papers claimed in stories apparently inspired by Downing Street that decommissioning would start by January 16. Ten days ago, they said the general had been invited to witness a symbolic destruction of some IRA weaponry, and would then oversee the sealing of arms dumps. But sources close to General de Chastelain say he was left mystified by these tales: the IRA had given him nothing to support any such claim. He had already sounded cautious in his December 10 report, just after he first met the IRA go-between, suggesting he would lay down a start date if paramilitaries failed to do so. He is thought since to have had a second meeting with the IRA. He also insists his mandate means destruction of weapons, and that the British and Irish governments would have to bring forward new legislation if \"sealing\" arms dumps was to be an option. The Northern Ireland Office disagrees and that will have to be settled. Gerry Adams has adopted a belligerent tone recently, demanding David Trimble show leadership and berating him for setting his own deadline for decommissioning. That was to be expected, for republicans want to wring as much as possible from the Patten report and Peter Mandelson's expected announcement on cutting the army's presence. Adams and McGuinness have adopted an analogy which throws doubt over the IRA's intentions. They say that the boat of inclusive democracy is only now setting sail with all on board; anyone who jumps off will surely drown. David Trimble said Sinn Fein would attract worldwide condemnation if the IRA subsequently failed to decommission. The new metaphor indicates a real truth: that he will somehow be blamed if the executive collapses should the IRA refuse to play ball. Sinn Fein is happy enough with the confusion. It improves its short-term negotiating position, and it also helps to reduce the likelihood of more defections from the IRA. There has been none of the explicit conditioning of republican grassroots that there was ahead of the agreement; there is no information from the security forces suggesting that decommissioning is imminent. Yet there is a perception within mainstream republicanism that decommissioning is coming. One senior provisional said there had been a deliberate policy of avoiding any internal debate, fostering the false impression that opposition was minimal. He felt those against decommissioning had been cleverly out-manoeuvred, with the leadership successfully pleading with them to stick with the peace process until it was too late to oppose it. There is bitterness within the IRA. Some members feel the leadership is prepared to jettison many of them because Sinn Fein's electoral strength is now republicanism's real strength. Opponents of decommissioning appear to be left with nowhere to go. Most dismiss the Real IRA, responsible for the Omagh bombing, and agree there can be no return to war. This all may point to IRA decommissioning taking place, but the only deadline republicans recognise is May, the aspirational date in the agreement for the completion of the Good Friday process. It seems highly unlikely a start will be made by February 12, with Sinn Fein and the IRA furious at what they see as Trimble's unilateral approach. Last week in the Commons, the Northern Ireland secretary talked tough, saying an early move is necessary if decommissioning is to be completed in four months. He was careful to mention no deadline other than May's. Unless General de Chastelain is able to break good news later this month, David Trimble is faced with little option but to make good his promises to his party. That would signal a return to the old certainty of uncertainty, and the demise of the now flourishing agreement. All over an issue which is about faith, not weapons.

This judgment, a repudiation of many of the country's core values, was issued yesterday not by foreign critics, but by an advisory panel set up by the conservative prime minister, Keizo Obuchi. The commission on Japan's goals in the 21st century, made up of experts including an astronaut and a playwright, was set up last year to plot a new direction for a country that has been racked by rising juvenile crime, a soaring suicide rate and record levels of bankruptcy and unemployment. There had been speculation that the commission would try to reassert conservative \"Asian values\", but the surprisingly liberal report, which covers everything from education to politics and business, appears to be telling people to stop being so \"typically\" Japanese. In a departure from the mura ishiki (village mentality) that is a feature of even urban Japanese society, it stressed the need for \"individual empowerment\". These are radical words in a country famous for the slogan \"the nail that sticks up must be hammered down\", and it echoes calls for change from the business community. Until recently, salarymen were valued for loyalty, patience and hard work and rewarded with jobs for life and promotion based primarily on their years of service. This system was perfect for production line workers, but Japan is now desperate for spontaneity, innovation and ambition. The panel suggests that the country shift away from its long-treasured egalitarianism - there is only a narrow gap between the salaries of executives and workers - in favour of a \"fair disparity\" to reward individual excellence. They call for action to curb \"the excessive degree of homogeneity and uniformity\" in education. Instead of sticking closely to a national curriculum, the panel says compulsory subjects should be taught three days a week, with two days used for advanced lessons, review classes or music and language lessons. The panel also argues for more lawyers; few disputes reach court, partly because of the desire to avoid a fuss. In the media, it proposes the abolition of the cosy press club ties between journalists and the subjects of their reports. Insularity also comes under criticism. The report proposes adopting English as a second language and suggests increasing immigration in a country that has long prided itself on its ethnic \"purity\". Mr Obuchi attended several of the group's meetings, but its recommendations are likely to be hard to swallow. He has promised to raise some of the issues in parliament, which is a step further than the last similar sweeping report, which has gathered dust since it was issued in the 1970s.

      "body": "<p>In October 1983, several thousand US paratroopers, backed by helicopters, the navy and ground forces, invaded the idyllic 21-mile-long Caribbean island of Grenada to purge it of a few dozen revolutionaries who had killed a popular prime minister.</p> <p>As invasions go, this was one of history's more lopsided. The choppers and the Stars and Stripes were flying over the capital, St George's, within hours. Hundreds of Cubans were quickly rounded up after a short fight, and something billed as democracy was restored. The 90,000 Grenadians mostly cheered and thanked their \"liberators\" and that, it was believed, was the last invasion the usually tranquil, sun-kissed island of bougainvilleas and palm trees, steep hills, blue sea and sandy beaches would ever know.</p> <p>Not quite. Grenada has a long history of invasions and colonists. The French kicked out and killed the native Caribs, the British kicked out the French, the Americans invaded to kick out the commies and now the giant cruise ships and global corporations are moving in.</p> <p>In the past few months, agents of Sainsbury's, one of the world's richest food empires (turnover \u00a36bn a year) have been quietly poring over maps, scouting out the land, making sorties into the fields and plotting with the Grenadian government (turnover \u00a3200m). The plan, hatched peacefully and with the best intentions, is to take over the agriculture of the entire island and make it organic.</p> <p>Sainsbury's problem is simple. It can't get enough high quality organic tropical fruit. British and, increasingly, American demand for healthily grown bananas, passion fruit, coconuts and mangoes is growing fast, but the quality is variable and importing it is notoriously difficult.</p> <p>For the company generals at headquarters, scratching their heads over how to supply thousands of hungry outlets trying to keep up with the organic and ethical consumer revolution (and the \u00a3200m-a-year high-profit market it has created), the four eastern Caribbean Windward Islands looked ideal.</p> <p>They have the right climate to grow perfect fruit (year-round sunshine, few hurricanes, lots of rain); the right image (former British colonies, picture of paradise); right governments (politically stable); right land (lots of disused plantations); all well-served by an old-style Anglo-Irish shipping company, Geest, which has long imported most of the tropical fruit Britain eats.</p> <p>Over the past year, Sainsbury's executives have toured St Lucia, Grenada, St Vincent and Dominica. What they have seen is four very different islands all more or less on their agricultural knees, unable to compete in the cutthroat global farm economy. As in so many other areas of the world, the Caribbean small farmers are being driven off the land, rural communities are on the rocks and there's an alarming, and increasing, disparity of wealth.</p> <p>High command at Sainsbury's finally settled on Grenada and St Lucia as its beachheads. The Grenadian government, for starters, offered Sainsbury's 440 prime acres of old plantations, and the St Lucians have proffered four large farms totalling 300 to 400 acres. Having got the Soil Association, which oversees organic standards in Britain, to check the suitability of the land for conversion to organic production, the supermarket has completed a six-month study and is now starting its pilot projects. The plan was backed by Dino Adriano, who has led the chain towards ethical and organic foods but was ousted last week.</p> <p>So far so good. The first crops are now about to be planted. These, says Ian Merton, the company's commercial director, should be \"the spearhead of organic fruit production\" and the trials should be \"a model to convert other land\". If all goes well, Sainsbury's should be getting all their organic bananas, mangoes, coconuts and passion fruit from Grenada and St Lucia within three years. After that, Merton foresees Grenada going completely organic and Sainsbury's acting as an agent to sell the produce worldwide. Exactly how he would persuade all the other farmers in the country to turn organic is glossed over.</p> <p>This is where the islands' governments catch their breath, having long been promised aid and assistance from richer countries that seldom appears. The plantation owners cut down most of the forests and introduced slavery; the British set up sugar and cocoa industries that failed and then encouraged tens of thousands of Windward Islanders to come to live in British cities; the Americans promised Grenada better roads, schools, housing and health after their invasion; more recently, Venezuela proposed that the whole island could be a model of \"sustainability\" and sent technicians and consultants. They have also had talks with Cuba, where most crops are now organic.</p> <p>Sainsbury's says its initiative is not a new era of colonialism, and it isn't in the sense that the company will not own land and will not, as the old French and British colonial farmers did, farm it themselves. But as so many growers for supermarkets in Britain and elsewhere know, the relationship between a giant corporation and small farmers is often fraught, with the power balance very much in the supermarket's favour; the potential for the supermarket to pull out is always there.</p> <p>But everyone we talked to in Grenada before Christmas was enthusiastic, in principle. The trouble was, hardly anyone knew anything. The local paper knew nothing. The island's nutmeg association shrugged. The banana growers had \"heard a rumour\" but were unsure. Robert Grant, a prominent farmer, hadn't a clue. Ditto the manager of the island's agricultural marketing board and the Agency for Rural Transformation, a local non-governmental organisation.</p> <p>\"This is news to me,\" says Lennox Purcell, one of the island's largest businessmen and estate owners. \"I, personally, will sell Mr Sainsbury my best mangoes. I can produce 20,000 pounds of ginger. I'm willing, happy and ready to grow everything for him if he makes it interesting. He could have all my avocado crop, vanilla, nutmeg. I shall piggyback on him. I will meet him at the airport.\"</p> <p>In the the brand new government buildings, Cecil Winsborough, Grenada's chief agronomist, was part of a team that met Sainsbury's before Christmas. He was cautious: \"In the past, the people who controlled agriculture were colonists. Today people are more serious and farmers will look at all ideas. We've been told our island is ideal for a complete transformation of its approach to agriculture. Sainsbury's came shopping here because they see us as a good investment. They are buying the image. People will buy the fruit thinking, boy, this place is pristine.</p> <p>\"But we are scared that it will make farming harder. [They're] telling us 'go the other way', but we don't know how this will turn out. Who will pay for the changeover period? A lot of nice things have been waved about, but we want to be cautious. We want to ensure it is profitable these days to grow for the local market rather than jump through all the hoops of international trade.\" He makes out a good case that farmers could be better off growing for the local market rather than export.</p> <p>Grenada (unemployment 16%, 65% of people dependent on farming) knows that it's getting harder than ever to compete in the global food market, which is being dominated by a few giant companies running huge plantations. It makes sense to diversify, especially after last year's World Trade Organisation ruling that Britain should not continue to give the island favoured terms of trade. When full-blown free trade eventually comes, the Windwards will be on a very sticky wicket.</p> <p>But for all the talk about guaranteeing markets, being ethical, acting as a catalyst for \"sustainable development\", diversifying and helping the islands to reduce their dependency on a few crops, Sainsbury may be doing little to help the majority of farmers.</p> <p>The islands want new markets, but also hi-tech assistance to make changes, and Sainsbury's will indeed help to teach some farmers how to go organic. But the supermarket wants, at least to start with, to work with the large farmers on land that is almost organic already and will cost little or nothing to convert. The vast majority of small growers live in virtual penury on land awash with the chemicals needed to produce the cosmetically appealing fruit that British supermarkets have insisted on for so long.</p> <p>These people cannot convert to organic because they live from week to week and would lose their liveli hoods for several years during the transition. No one, least of all Sainsbury's, is going to pay for them to change. Sainsbury's says it will try to help get EU grants, but whether these materialise is anyone's guess.</p> <p>The company has also chosen the most prosperous and diversified of all the Windward Islands. Neighbouring St Vincent is almost entirely dependent on selling bananas to British supermarkets, but the world price is low, the work gets harder than ever and there's so little profit that many are giving up. \"Ideally Mr Sainsbury will come to St Vincent to talk to the farmers here and say we want this and that,\" says Julian Boyea, a banana grower. \"We want Sainsbury's to come and speak to us at a church, a school or something. We would love Mr Sainsbury to come to St Vincent. Tell him to come and talk. He can have the best bananas in the world.\"</p> <p>Renwick Rose, who runs the Windward Islands National Farmers Association, says: \"Sainsbury's concern is that there are too many small fish in the sea, so it's easier to catch a whale [a country] than three million herring. I'm not sure of Sainsbury's strategy. Do they want to take over Grenada?\"</p> <p>He and many others are convinced the answer is \"Fairtrade\", an alternative trading system that would guarantee fruit prices in a volatile world market, cut out the middlemen and allow even the smallest farmers to have a say in their own future. Sainsbury's says publicly that it wants to foster this, but so far it has not been able to organise the system in the Windwards. On Monday, however, it sold its first Fairtrade bananas, but from Costa Rica.</p> <p>\"We in the Windwards are suffering. Yes, we need help. We need the supermarkets,\" says Rose. \"But the terms of trade must be fair.\"</p>",

Sainsbury's says publicly that it wants to foster this, but so far it has not been able to organise the system in the Windwards. On Monday, however, it sold its first Fairtrade bananas, but from Costa Rica. \"We in the Windwards are suffering. Yes, we need help. We need the supermarkets,\" says Rose. \"But the terms of trade must be fair.\"",

It's not an unusual complaint for the stars of the sitcom, some of whom are so thin that they must be teetering on the brink of unconsciousness. But Macpherson is The Body for goodness' sake - she is beauty and fitness rolled into one. Surely a part as a six-week love interest for Matt Leblanc can't be too overwhelming for a former supermodel?</p> <p>Work is in fact only partly to blame. Her collapse is said to be due to interrupted nights with her two-year-old son. Macpherson does not employ a nanny and during her 14 hours a day on set, is also bringing up Flynn.</p> <p>The initial reaction of many working mothers to the news from New York will have been a combination of sympathy and relief. Who hasn't felt exhausted and emotionally frazzled trying to combine a job with motherhood? I remember driving home from work when my baby was small and sticking my fingernails into my palms to keep awake. So there is something of a reprieve in discovering that even a superwoman like Macpherson can't manage it all.</p> <p>How much worse if she was starring in a hit sitcom, looking healthy and luminous, able to do without sleep and still care full-time for her son. But Macpherson's swoon raises a more serious question. Why are an apparently increasing number of high-powered mothers choosing to do without a nanny? In Macpherson's case it's plainly not a question of money. She has diversified from her modelling career into underwear design, fitness videos and acting and is worth an estimated $26m.</p> <p>It's not for lack of money that Victoria and David Beckham decided to go without paid help either, choosing to take their son Brooklyn to work (Beckham took him to a training session when Victoria was away), change nappies themselves and roping in family to help. Melanie Blatt from All Saints is also avoiding a nanny, taking both her baby and mother to the recording studios.</p> <p>Three celebrities do not a trend make, of course, but their decisions do reflect a disconcerting school of thought that childcare is for wimps, and that we should be able to work and parent at the same time. It's a trend that starts as soon as you give birth in hospital. Once you stayed in for five days and everyone made a fuss of you as a new mother. Now you're out almost as soon as the umbilical cord is cut.</p> <p>Once, having it all meant being a working mother. You went to work, rushed out to the supermarket at lunchtime for some pre-prepared microwaveable suppers and hurried home to start the evening's parenting job. Now, it seems to mean working and being a mother simultanously.</p> <p>You are doing your job and being the sole carer for your baby. Geddit? Not only are you doing some urgent filing but you are teaching your baby the various noises that zoo animals make to ensure they get into a good school later in life.</p> <p>Needless to say, it's a whole lot easier to pass up the nanny if you are Elle Macpherson. No one's going to give you grief for bringing the baby into work. Employers will happily provide a stream of minions to hold the baby when you need to do some actual work. Everyone will be enormously understanding if you need a break to breastfeed or tickle your baby's tummy. Try turning up for work with your sprog at a factory or a shop.</p> <p>While it is vaguely irksome even to consider why celebrities may not want nannies when many parents spend most of their wages struggling to afford one, most mothers will identify to some degree with the reluctance of Macpherson and Co to subcontract their parenting responsibilities. A Martian dropping in on any middle-class urban dinner table might quickly deduce that childcare was the most fraught issue facing the planet.</p> <p>Mothers may enjoy the business of work but torture themselves with worries that their child is not safe away from them. Regular documentaries showing nannies on hidden cameras using babies as punch-bags, send the guilt levels soaring. What mother doesn't ask herself if working is really worth it? And then there's the jealousy. That somone else will see your baby's first step, hear her first word. Some mothers, pitifully, ask their nanny to write copious notes describing their children's bowel movements. Everyone tells you that childhood is over in the twinkle of an eye; suddenly they're smelly teenagers who don't want to know you, let alone give you a cuddle.</p> <p>In the employment market of the future, the line between work and home, we are told, will become increasingly blurred. The increase in net access at home should make office working at least less of a nine-to-five affair. So home-working mother will be able to attach her baby to her breast while using the keyboard with one hand and talking into the phone perched on her shoulder. She will work when the baby sleeps and do her maternal duties when the baby wakes, thus ensuring she has no time to sleep herself.</p> <p>She will fret that she will not make a work deadline because today her baby was teething and will manage her two full-time jobs, as parent and employee, in a fugue state. Often she will forget to feed herself, shovelling up the remains of pureed carrot and potato (which she made herself because she wants to be a good mother and cook fresh foods). She will grunt to her partner who she will never see because she is using up all the hours in the day on work or parenting. Watch the birth rate continue to fall.</p> <p>Having a baby is exhausting, going without sleep is torture. It is hard, verging on impossible, to work efficiently if you are woken six times a night. The most relaxed parents I know are the ones who have good childcare, not the ones who try to do it all themselves. Letting go of any of your responsibility as a parent is enormously difficult but if you are trying to work, without the support of an extended family, you need someone to help you. Most mothers feel physically and emotionally knackered. And Elle Macpherson, it seems, has joined us.</p> <p><b>Mother knows best: the working mums who say no to nannies</b> by Esther Addley<br></p> <p><b> Caroline Quentin</b></p> <p>Quentin gave birth to daughter Emily Rose in September, having spent the day of the delivery filming Jonathan Creek. She and partner Sam Farmer were resolved not to hire a nanny. \"I don't want a nanny early on. I want Sam and I to have the baby to ourselves.\"</p> <p>She has not ruled out the possibility of future help, but at present the two are dividing the childcare between them. \"We share everything 50-50. Well, it's probably about 70-30 actually, he is so adept. Mind you, I'm not bad myself. I have taken to it.\"</p> <p><b> Duchess of York</b></p> <p>After going through three nannies in three years, in December 1994 the Duchess said she would not be employing another to look after her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, then six and four. The arrangement was seen as unusual in royal circles, but with both children at school and her husband helping with the childcare, the famously cash-strapped Duchess may have seen a nanny as an unnecessary expense.</p> <p><b> Patsy Palmer</b></p> <p>EastEnders' Bianca left the soap last year to spend more time with her seven-year-old son. \"Charley is my number one priority,\" she said at the time. \"I think a lot of women feel this way and it is a question of being confident enough to go for it.\" Palmer, who is now expecting her second child, still lives just around the corner from her mother, who, along with a teacher, cares for her grandson while the actress is working.</p> <p><b> Victoria Beckham</b></p> <p>Despite a combined income running well into eight figures, Posh Spice and husband David Beckham insisted before the birth of baby Brooklyn that they would care for the imminent arrival themselves.</p> <p>\"I'll just take it into the studio with me,\" declared the expectant mother. Both Beckhams come from close families who lend a hand with childcare, but after recent kidnap threats security has been stepped up around the child, now 10 months.</p> <p><b> Teri Hatcher</b></p> <p>The star of the Superman TV series announced soon after her daughter's birth in 1997 that she would be taking a career break in order to be a full-time mother. Hatcher said that her decision was prompted by the Louise Woodward case.</p> <p>\"It reinforced my belief that the parents should be the caregivers. In a child's first years you should be doing the interacting. If you get a nanny, that's where the bond relationship goes. I just feel lucky I can afford to stay at home.\"</p>",

She will work when the baby sleeps and do her maternal duties when the baby wakes, thus ensuring she has no time to sleep herself. She will fret that she will not make a work deadline because today her baby was teething and will manage her two full-time jobs, as parent and employee, in a fugue state. Often she will forget to feed herself, shovelling up the remains of pureed carrot and potato (which she made herself because she wants to be a good mother and cook fresh foods). She will grunt to her partner who she will never see because she is using up all the hours in the day on work or parenting. Watch the birth rate continue to fall. Having a baby is exhausting, going without sleep is torture. It is hard, verging on impossible, to work efficiently if you are woken six times a night. The most relaxed parents I know are the ones who have good childcare, not the ones who try to do it all themselves. Letting go of any of your responsibility as a parent is enormously difficult but if you are trying to work, without the support of an extended family, you need someone to help you. Most mothers feel physically and emotionally knackered. And Elle Macpherson, it seems, has joined us. Mother knows best: the working mums who say no to nannies by Esther Addley Caroline Quentin Quentin gave birth to daughter Emily Rose in September, having spent the day of the delivery filming Jonathan Creek. She and partner Sam Farmer were resolved not to hire a nanny. \"I don't want a nanny early on. I want Sam and I to have the baby to ourselves.\" She has not ruled out the possibility of future help, but at present the two are dividing the childcare between them. \"We share everything 50-50. Well, it's probably about 70-30 actually, he is so adept. Mind you, I'm not bad myself. I have taken to it.\" Duchess of York After going through three nannies in three years, in December 1994 the Duchess said she would not be employing another to look after her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, then six and four. The arrangement was seen as unusual in royal circles, but with both children at school and her husband helping with the childcare, the famously cash-strapped Duchess may have seen a nanny as an unnecessary expense. Patsy Palmer EastEnders' Bianca left the soap last year to spend more time with her seven-year-old son. \"Charley is my number one priority,\" she said at the time. \"I think a lot of women feel this way and it is a question of being confident enough to go for it.\" Palmer, who is now expecting her second child, still lives just around the corner from her mother, who, along with a teacher, cares for her grandson while the actress is working. Victoria Beckham Despite a combined income running well into eight figures, Posh Spice and husband David Beckham insisted before the birth of baby Brooklyn that they would care for the imminent arrival themselves. \"I'll just take it into the studio with me,\" declared the expectant mother. Both Beckhams come from close families who lend a hand with childcare, but after recent kidnap threats security has been stepped up around the child, now 10 months. Teri Hatcher The star of the Superman TV series announced soon after her daughter's birth in 1997 that she would be taking a career break in order to be a full-time mother. Hatcher said that her decision was prompted by the Louise Woodward case. \"It reinforced my belief that the parents should be the caregivers. In a child's first years you should be doing the interacting. If you get a nanny, that's where the bond relationship goes. I just feel lucky I can afford to stay at home.\"",

Back then, the Schroder family stake was worth under \u00a350m, with the whole shooting match valued at \u00a3100m. Today, as the sharp edge of the business is hived off to the Americans, Bruno Schroder and his sister, Charmaine, are sitting on stock worth \u00a31.5bn. </p> <p>In the process, Mr Bischoff has won himself the routine description of one of London's truly great investment bankers.

      "bodyText": "It is 17 years since Win Bischoff was parachuted back into London to fix the Schroder family firm. The client base had been shot to shreds, the world of corporate finance was in a spin and everyone wondered whether things were moving too fast for an institution struggling to modernise under the weight of such history and tradition. Thomas Tilling, one of its biggest fee-payers at the time, under attack from the old BTR takeover machine, famously moved its business to rival War burg with the parting shot: \"When you are fighting for your life you need the best.\" As chief executive and then chairman, Mr Bischoff did a bit more than just fix things. Back then, the Schroder family stake was worth under \u00a350m, with the whole shooting match valued at \u00a3100m. Today, as the sharp edge of the business is hived off to the Americans, Bruno Schroder and his sister, Charmaine, are sitting on stock worth \u00a31.5bn. In the process, Mr Bischoff has won himself the routine description of one of London's truly great investment bankers. But he has had to fight extraordinarily hard once again over the past couple of years and it seems the best he can now expect is by throwing in his lot with the transatlantic marauders. The Brits, and to a large extent European corporate financiers generally, have just been blown out of the water by the members of Wall Street's bulge bracket. It is really quite embarrassing.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Back in the 60s the young Frances de la Tour asked the director Peter Hall if she could play Juliet. Hall's response was blunt. He said it would never happen because she was far too tall and gangly and didn't fit the public's perception of how Juliet should look. </p> <p>Thirty years later the Royal Shakespeare Company announces that Frances de la Tour will be starring in Antony and Cleopatra opposite Alan Bates. A cruel little joke begins to go the rounds: which one of them will be playing the \"serpent of the Nile\" and which one Antony? It seems that preconceptions take a very long time to break down. </p> <p>Journalists like to describe Frances de la Tour as having a mournful jolie laide face and an angular body. In fact, at 56, she is a strikingly attractive and confident woman. Like Marilyn Monroe she knows how to make her presence felt. I recently watched her from a distance at a film gala. There were plenty of far more obviously beautiful women present, but it was the red-headed de la Tour that people couldn't take their eyes off. \"Who is that incredibly attractive woman?\" asked the man next to me. </p> <p>But she has never fitted the mould of the classically beautiful Shakespearean heroine. She joined the RSC in 1965, straight after graduating from the Drama Centre (the radical breakaway from the Central School of Speech and Drama), and although Peter Brook had the far-sightedness to cast her as Helena in his famous production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, de la Tour never really got the parts she deserved. She should have done brainy Rosalind for the RSC's As You Like It. Instead she was cast as the bumpkin Audrey. </p> <p>So de la Tour left and went her own way, determined that she shouldn't be strait-jacketed as so many brilliant but not conventionally good-looking actresses had before her into constantly playing the comedienne. </p> <p>\"However insecure I was when I was young, I was certain that I wouldn't go down that route,\" she explains. \"A lot of those women were great artists but they suffered the most limited casting and had to constantly repeat themselves.\" </p> <p>Instead she stretched herself, playing Hamlet before such gender-bending experiments were fashionable, and finding a lasting although not always welcome fame for her superb performance playing the lovelorn spinster Miss Jones opposite Leonard Rossiter in Rising Damp, the 70s TV comedy considered by many to be one of the finest sit-coms of all time. That inevitably brought its own kind of strait-jacket. </p> <p>De la Tour isn't bitter about the missed opportunities or the parts she never played. After all, she's had some great roles - the raw, big-boned Josie in Eugene O'Neill's A Moon for the Misbegotten and Stephanie, the violinist afflicted by a muscle-wasting disease, in Duet for One, the play that her then partner, Tom Kempinski, wrote especially for her. And it's not that she's tired of playing second fiddle to others, as she did to her ex-Workers Revolutionary Party colleague Vanessa Redgrave in When She Danced or Maggie Smith in Three Tall Women. In fact, she danced off with the best supporting actress award for the former. </p> <p>No, what rankles is that de la Tour believes it is the great playwrights such as Shakespeare and Chekhov who offer an actor the chance to grow and she has done so little of them. </p> <p>\"I don't think acting is a question of becoming somebody else. It is a question of becoming your fullest self through the part,\" she says. \"It is not an ego trip. You allow the character to enter you, but the moments when you are closest to it are the moments when you are most in touch with yourself. Whenever I give acting classes my approach is the opposite of what is regarded as Method acting. What the actor feels is important, but what the actor feels about the part is not.\" </p> <p>But it can be a painful, revealing process - one that de la Tour agrees is almost like being in therapy. Playing Josie in Moon For the Misbegotten cured her of the anxiety attacks that had plagued her for years. </p> <p>\"I really wrestled with that part. I was really ashamed of my voice and I tried to compensate by acting big. It was only when I stopped and was myself that it all fell into place. It was like a revelation. The attacks went.\" </p> <p>But she believes that the actor can't develop if he or she doesn't get the really good roles. \"I've had a wonderful time and had some very nice things said about me for some parts that I've played. But a lot of those roles don't require you to go anywhere other than where you've already been. It is frustrating to have to put a full stop on a role because it doesn't have the breadth to allow you to take it further. However good an artist you are, if you don't fit into people's preconceptions, you won't be given the chance to do it.\" </p> <p>Which brings us back to the question of why de la Tour hasn't always got those roles that she yearns for and could so obviously play. After all, even the chance to play Cleopatra was a result of her own efforts and her friendship with director Steven Pimlott. They've been talking about the project for 10 years. </p> <p>\"I didn't sit around on my haunches waiting for the RSC to call and say 'How about Cleopatra?' If I had, I'd still be waiting. Steven and I waited for the right moment to suggest it.\" </p> <p>So why hasn't de la Tour got those roles? Was it her radical politics? Or the fact that she became associated with a particular kind of desperate woman, such as Violet in Tennessee Williams' Small Craft Warnings and Miss Jones in Rising Damp? Or was it simply that she wasn't conventionally good-looking enough? </p> <p> Things get a touch frosty at this point. \"I am so hostile to the question,\" she says politely, and fiercely points out that she has never had eight double chins and that there have been plenty of classical actresses both before her and since who haven't been raving beauties and that hasn't stopped them playing Shakespeare. So if she refuses to accept that she may not have got parts because of her looks, why does she think they escaped her? Her answer seems astonishing: \"Maybe people didn't think I was talented.\" </p> <p>I find it curious that anyone would prefer to believe people thought her untalented rather than not beautiful, but a straw poll among girlfriends reveals that, given the choice when younger, they'd all have plumped for being beautiful rather than being talented or clever. So maybe de la Tour isn't that different after all. </p> <p>Certainly she has grown more and more attractive as the years have gone by. As other actresses have lost their looks, de la Tour has grown into hers, although she is still reluctant to be photographed. But when the conversation warms up again, she concedes that being told you're too gangly to play Juliet does feed your anxieties. </p> <p>\"You begin to believe that maybe you couldn't do it. So instead you long to play unusual parts, and you learn to do them very well, and that feeds the preconception. These are the lonely people, the misbegotten. Then you start not bothering to do your hair or make-up and you get more acclaim for showing these people warts and all, and less chance of getting the roles you really want. </p> <p>\"I've never understood all this talk about my looks. But Tom [Kempinski] once said something interesting to me. He said, 'Whatever nonsense people write about you, there is a truth in it somewhere. What they say about you is not about what you are giving out - it's about something inner about you that they've spotted.' Maybe without realising it I did exude something.\" </p> <p>What she exudes now is confidence, and confidence is very sexy. This is a woman in her prime, a woman absolutely ready to play Cleopatra. </p> <p>Many years ago when de la Tour was at drama school, a friend overheard the principal telling the new intake about the year above. \"In that year,\" he said, \"we have a girl called Frances de la Tour. She is very beautiful, but she doesn't know it.\" </p> <p>She didn't, but she does now. </p> <p>\u0095 Antony and Cleopatra opens at the Barbican, London EC2 (0171-638 8891), tonight.</p>",

But a lot of those roles don't require you to go anywhere other than where you've already been. It is frustrating to have to put a full stop on a role because it doesn't have the breadth to allow you to take it further. However good an artist you are, if you don't fit into people's preconceptions, you won't be given the chance to do it.\" Which brings us back to the question of why de la Tour hasn't always got those roles that she yearns for and could so obviously play. After all, even the chance to play Cleopatra was a result of her own efforts and her friendship with director Steven Pimlott. They've been talking about the project for 10 years. \"I didn't sit around on my haunches waiting for the RSC to call and say 'How about Cleopatra?' If I had, I'd still be waiting. Steven and I waited for the right moment to suggest it.\" So why hasn't de la Tour got those roles? Was it her radical politics? Or the fact that she became associated with a particular kind of desperate woman, such as Violet in Tennessee Williams' Small Craft Warnings and Miss Jones in Rising Damp? Or was it simply that she wasn't conventionally good-looking enough? Things get a touch frosty at this point. \"I am so hostile to the question,\" she says politely, and fiercely points out that she has never had eight double chins and that there have been plenty of classical actresses both before her and since who haven't been raving beauties and that hasn't stopped them playing Shakespeare. So if she refuses to accept that she may not have got parts because of her looks, why does she think they escaped her? Her answer seems astonishing: \"Maybe people didn't think I was talented.\" I find it curious that anyone would prefer to believe people thought her untalented rather than not beautiful, but a straw poll among girlfriends reveals that, given the choice when younger, they'd all have plumped for being beautiful rather than being talented or clever. So maybe de la Tour isn't that different after all. Certainly she has grown more and more attractive as the years have gone by. As other actresses have lost their looks, de la Tour has grown into hers, although she is still reluctant to be photographed. But when the conversation warms up again, she concedes that being told you're too gangly to play Juliet does feed your anxieties. \"You begin to believe that maybe you couldn't do it. So instead you long to play unusual parts, and you learn to do them very well, and that feeds the preconception. These are the lonely people, the misbegotten. Then you start not bothering to do your hair or make-up and you get more acclaim for showing these people warts and all, and less chance of getting the roles you really want. \"I've never understood all this talk about my looks. But Tom [Kempinski] once said something interesting to me. He said, 'Whatever nonsense people write about you, there is a truth in it somewhere. What they say about you is not about what you are giving out - it's about something inner about you that they've spotted.' Maybe without realising it I did exude something.\" What she exudes now is confidence, and confidence is very sexy. This is a woman in her prime, a woman absolutely ready to play Cleopatra. Many years ago when de la Tour was at drama school, a friend overheard the principal telling the new intake about the year above. \"In that year,\" he said, \"we have a girl called Frances de la Tour. She is very beautiful, but she doesn't know it.\" She didn't, but she does now. \u0095 Antony and Cleopatra opens at the Barbican, London EC2 (0171-638 8891), tonight.",

He was also one of the most wanted men in Europe, indicted as a suspected war criminal by the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague.</p> <p>Born in Brezice, a small Slovenian town 12 miles west of Zagreb, the Croatian capital, he was the son of a senior officer in the Yugoslav airforce. As a teenager, he developed a reputation as a tearaway and delinquent, and by his early 20s had embarked on a life of criminality in northern Europe. </p> <p>Yugoslavia's policy of allowing its citizens to work in western Europe, combined with labour shortages in West Germany and Scandinavia, led to the growth of huge Croat and Serb emigr\u00e9 communities during the 1960s. This was accompanied by a large criminal fraternity that dominated the Frankfurt underworld, and was linked to crime syndicates in Norway, Sweden and the Benelux countries, as well as in Italy to the south. </p> <p>Raznatovic, who adopted the moniker Arkan from one of his false passports at this time, became notorious as a specialist in armed robbery. Goran Vukovic, a fellow gangster who was himself gunned down in Belgrade in 1994, recalled Arkan's early years: \"Of all of us, Arkan robbed the most banks; he walked into them almost like they were self-service stores. No one can quarrel with that fact about him. I don't know about politics, but as far as robbery is concerned, he was really unsurpassed.\" </p> <p>But Arkan did get repeatedly caught. He was first jailed in 1975, when a Brussels court sentenced him to 15 years in prison. He escaped after serving 42 months, establishing a remarkable pattern of break outs from western prisons. He fled jails in Holland and Germany, and evaded arrest in Sweden and Italy. </p> <p>Such was his ability to slip through borders, and out of prison, that his colleagues began to suspect, correctly, that he was collaborating with the Yugoslav secret police. In any event, he was not arrested when he returned to Belgrade in 1986 to open his renowned cake and ice-cream shop, located opposite the stadium of Serbia's most successful football team, Red Star Belgrade. </p> <p>Arkan soon became chairman of Red Star's fan club, Delije (the Warriors), where he naturally found plenty of aggressive young men from whom he could pick recruits for his criminal gang. By November 1990, he was already working with the Serbian authorities in their attempts to destabilise Croatia. He was arrested in the village of Dvorna Uni by Croatian police and charged with unauthorised possession of weapons. He returned to Belgrade after six months in custody. At home, he boasted he would soon \"be back in Zagreb to open a cake shop on Republic Square.\" </p> <p> The then Croatian interior minister, Josip Boljkovac, has revealed that the Belgrade authorities bought Arkan's freedom from imprisonment for 1m German marks, a trade-off which many Croats would later regret - though, at the time, the Croatian government was desperate for hard currency to purchase weapons. Viewed from another perspective, the deal also indicated how closely Arkan had become involved with President Slobodan Milosevic's Serbian government. </p> <p>During 1991, Arkan's Serb Volunteer Guard, or \"Tigers\", became the most powerful paramilitary unit in eastern Slavonija, the part of Croatia that borders Serbia. In a massive operation of plunder and slaughter in the villages surrounding the besieged town of Vukovar, Arkan established a veritable corporation in Erdut, his local headquarters. This was to become the beginning of his criminal empire, which, at the time of his death, was the largest mafia operation in Serbia. He repeated this strategy in Bosnia and Hercegovina, driving out or murdering Muslims from eastern Bosnia, and then establishing strong commercial links with the wartime Bosnian Serb parastate. </p> <p>Arkan's self-publicity was greatly enhanced by his marriage in 1995 to Ceca, one of Serbia's most glamorous \"turbo-folk\" stars, with whom he had two children to add to the seven he had fathered in previous relationships and marriages. </p> <p>In stark contrast to President Milosevic, Arkan and his political movement, the Serbian Unity party, paid great homage to the Serbian Orthodox church and other symbols associated with the Chetnik tradition of Serbian nationalism. He was, however, invariably at odds with the other self-proclaimed Chetnik leader, Vojislav Seselj. </p> <p>In the late 1990s, Arkan began to establish closer links with Milosevic's political enemies, notably Milo Djukanovic, the president of Montenegro. In April 1999, it was also revealed that he was on the list of indicted war criminals at the Hague tribunal, along with Milosevic himself. </p> <p>For the last year, Arkan had been one of the most wanted men in Europe, but his mafia interests were clashing ever more frequently with those of gangs associated with JUL, the party run by Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic. It would be a great surprise to all in Serbia if the circumstances surrounding Arkan's murder were ever cleared up, but few in the remainder of the former Yugoslavia will be mourning him. </p> <p> <strong> Misha Glenny</strong> </p> <p>Zeljko 'Arkan' Raznatovic, gangster and war crimes suspect, born April 17 1952; died January 15 2000</p>",

Philip worked tirelessly to establish them as a medium that could hold centre stage, by themselves, for a whole evening. </p> <p>Few brass players of recent generations can have escaped benefiting from his influence - whether by playing works he commissioned, studying at one of the three music colleges where he held senior positions, or enjoying the new credibility afforded to brass chamber music that he wrested out of the \"posh\" musical establishment. With his ensemble, he made more than 50 recordings and gave 87 world premieres. He had 71 works written especially for him. </p> <p>Born in Bath and brought up in a London family of trumpeters, Philip won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. During the next 25 years, he held the position of principal trumpet in six London orchestras - a unique achievement, but still not his real ambition. In 1947, he heard a performance of brass chamber music, rare at that time, by four players from the Concertgebouw Orchestra, which started him on the path he followed until retirement in 1986. </p> <p>In 1951 he formed a quartet, the first group to bear the name of the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble, already with its first piece of specially commissioned music. At this time, a group of brass instruments, no matter how distinguished its members, was still seen as a \"brass band\", only to be considered for open-air music, accompaniments to singers, or ceremonial performances. </p> <p>Philip's reaction to this was typical of him: not to bemoan it or rail against it, but over the years to acquire new repertory, promote his own concerts, seek out engagements and refine the group's performances into something that would persuade promoters and public to think again. </p> <p>The group expanded in 1963 into a quintet of two trumpets, horn, trombone and tuba. As its prestige grew, Philip was able to employ in it the cream of Britain's brass soloists; two considerable musicians to join were Elgar Howarth, whose enthusiasm for 20th-century music had a great influence, and John Fletcher, tuba icon and musical polymath, whose loyalty and quirky humour lightened Philip's load immensely. </p> <p>As performance opportunities multiplied through the 1970s, the ensemble grew in size until it settled on the combination of four trumpets, four trombones, horn and tuba. This particular grouping, rich and varied in sound, had a unique sonority, born of fastidious attention to the details of balance, intonation and nuance, immediately recognisable by brassmen and laymen alike. It achieved unprecedented popularity, performing nearly 100 engagements a year in the 1980s across Europe, the United States, Japan and Australia. </p> <p>This acclaim was not derived wholly from polished performance standards. Philip was the master programme-planner, every minute being evaluated in terms of its demands on both players and audience (or \"customers\" as he preferred them to be called). \"Middle of the road\", often used disparagingly, would be unlikely to cause any offence to Philip, a pragmatist who knew exactly where his act was positioned. He was not drawn by instinct to the avant-garde, unless the music was carefully and idiomatically written for the instruments. Those of us who made his transcriptions of classical and romantic music sometimes had to rein back his enthusiasm - to convince him, for example, that a suite of Chopin piano pieces arranged for brass was not one of his better ideas. </p> <p> He was adamant that instrumental pyrotechnics should not form a substantial part of his programme, content just to tease the audience with an encore that would highlight the brilliance of one of his team, but never himself. His willingness to push others to the fore makes even more remarkable his achievement of blending 10 top players into the \"Philip Jones\" sound. In fact, in the years before his retirement, he became much less prominent as soloist or front man, while the ensemble became even more stamped with his personality. </p> <p>The huge amount of administration for concert tours and recordings was shared by Philip's wife, Ursula Strebi, but he shouldered all the musical preparation himself, leaving his players free to concentrate on their performance. While we were enjoying a pre-concert meal, Philip could always been found sitting alone on the stage, carefully positioning everyone's music, lining up the stands, and checking sight lines. </p> <p>After retirement from playing, he continued a full life as teacher, administrator and adjudicator, a role that took him around the world.

This time, however, the linesman's flag stayed by his side. The sight of Sinton in such impressive form provoked memories of happier times for Wednesday and his supply line from the left flank posed constant problems for his former club during long spells of concerted pressure from the home side. The visitors provided a few incisive moments of their own, most notably when the Belgian striker Gilles De Bilde manoeuvred a shooting opportunity inside the first few minutes only to arrow his left-foot drive narrowly wide. But it was not difficult to establish why Wednesday had failed to muster a single victory away from home all season, scoring in only four matches on their travels. Wilson attempted to increase his side's attacking enterprise by introducing Donnelly for Philip Scott after the interval and the former Celtic player forced the first save of note from Michael Oakes within 30 seconds of the re-start, but there was precious little else from the visiting side as the game continued to stagnate. The contingent from Gillingham will have returned south optimistic about their chances of progressing into the sixth round.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's hi-tech boom powered the biggest gain in manufacturing output for four-and-a-half years in November but the strong pound is still handicapping many more traditional industries, according to official figures published yesterday. Overall output leapt 0.6% in the month - twice as high as expected in the City - taking it 2.2% above the level of a year ago, and the biggest annual increase since June 1995. Analysts said the surprising strength of the data from the office for national statistics reinforced expectations of further interest rate rises in the wake of last week's 0.25% increase to 5.75%. \"Although it is other data, such as the labour market, service sector and the housing market which is driving rates higher, the strength of this report should help seal another 0.25% increase at the next MPC meeting on February 10,\" said Deutsche Bank economist Ciaran Barr. November's surge produced a 1.1% increase in manufacturing output over the past three months, illustrating a dramatic turnaround in the sector's fortunes from early last year, when it was in recession. But analysis by industrial sub-sector reveals a patchy performance with only five out of 14 recording significant growth - chemicals, electrical and optical equipment, transport equipment, food, drink and tobacco, and base metals. Leading the way between September and November was the chemicals sector, where output rose 4.3% compared to the previous three months. ONS officials said the pharmaceuticals industry was do ing particularly well, benefiting from robust demand for new treatments for baldness and irritable bowel syndrome. In joint second place, recording an output growth of 2.5%, were electrical and optical equipment and transport equipment. Production volume of mobile telephones increased by 11% in the quarter and output of TV receivers - including digital set-top boxes - by 7%. Firms manufactur ing equipment for linking homes and businesses to the internet also did well, as did the semiconductor industry. The latter picked up business lost by storm-damaged factories in Taiwan. Sectors suffering declines in output included textiles and leather - underwear production was down almost 4% in the last three months - and machinery and equipment. Dharshini David, an economist at HSBC, said the figures indicated that the manufacturing recovery has shifted up a gear, due to robust demand. But Neil Parker of the Royal Bank of Scotland said the strength of the data may have been exaggerated by manufacturers rebuilding stock before the millennium. \"We should not read too much into these figures, but they certainly suggest a more positive outlook for manufacturing,\" he said. Scots not suffering, says George Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, yesterday denied that the Scottish economy was suffering from high interest rates designed to cool overheating in the south-east. In a speech to the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, he said monetary policy was set to curb inflation in the economy as a whole and that there was no evidence that growth and employment were suffering. He said that employment in Scotland was around its all-time high and that the Scottish economy had grown by an average of 2.6% over the past seven years or so, compared to 2.8% for the economy as a whole. \"Indeed, is seems clear on the facts that over time the Scottish economy prospers very much in line with the economy of the UK as a whole.

      "bodyText": "One of the last of the City's blue-blooded banks fell into foreign hands yesterday when Schroders sold its investment banking business to Salomon Smith Barney. The \u00a31.3bn deal with part of the world's largest financial firm Citigroup will land a \u00a3360m windfall for the Schroder family - already the eighth richest in the country - and promises hefty \"golden handcuffs\" for the Schroders investment bankers who will join the US firm. While the sale immediately evoked fears of large scale jobs cut in the City, the worst of the pain is expected to be felt on Wall Street where Schroders employs 1,800 bankers whose franchise is being consigned to the history books. The two groups, which said they were creating a \"powerful new force\" in in vestment banking, however, tried to play down job cuts pointing to the complementary nature of the businesses. Schroders, which is in the FTSE 100 index, will retain its troubled investment management arm and remain listed. It intends to invest \u00a3450m of the sale proceeds, which are not being returned to shareholders, to beef up its fund management business and launch a new private banking operation. The firm insisted that the new-look company had the backing of the Schroder family - led by Bruno - who will retain almost 50% in the slimmed-down entity. It was unclear last night whether the family would take their 40% share in the \u00a390m being distributed to shareholders in cash - and face a tax bill - or take loan notes or shares in Citigroup, Salomon Smith Barney's parent company. City sources said the transaction - which surprised many in the City yesterday - leaves just Robert Fleming, still con trolled by the Fleming family, as the an \"independent\" investment bank. The independent tag could also be applied to Cazenove, the highly regarded broking firm, and Rothschilds and Lazards whose roots both lie outside Britain. \"On a combination, this is a very compelling case not just for shareholders but for staff and clients,\" said Sir Win Bischoff, the chairman of Schroders, who will become chairman of Citigroup in Europe. The deal, which both sides called a \"merger of equals\", ends months of speculation about the future of Schroders, which had been struggling to boost its presence in the United States, where the bank has failed to make much headway since taking over Wertheim, a New York-based boutique. Salomon Smith Barney first approached Schroders about the deal at the end of last year after it failed to cement a takeover of Beacon, a privately owned US investment bank. The new investment bank - which will be known as Schroders Salomon Smith Barney in Europe but will lose the Schroders tag in the US - would be catapulted up to seventh in the all-important mergers and acquisitions league tables. Neither had a reputation for advising on the biggest deals in Europe and this gap in their arsenal had become particularly important as such deals are expected to flourish over the next year as a result of increased globalisation and the introduction of the single currency. Citigroup hopes that the acquisition will enable the combined group to be taken seriously as a \"bulge bracket\" investment bank along with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Diane Glossman, banking analyst at Lehman Brothers, said: \"This is certainly something that Salomon needs, especially in the European context.\" Citigroup had been \"looking to bolster their franchise in Europe for some time\", she said.",

Sir Alan bought Viglen through his private company, Amshold, last October when he topped a purchase of 10m shares for \u00a32.4m with an offer worth a further \u00a317m. Viglen was demerged from Amstrad in July last year after which shares fell to 14p. With Spurs back in the top flight of the Premiership - and his knighthood - Sir Alan, written off more than once in his career, says it has been a good new year. \"So far.\"",

In this case we are in country-house England where the rakish Lord Illingworth has fastened on Gerald Arbuthnot to be his private secretary only to discover, when Mrs Arbuthnot appears, that the young man is the son he casually sired a generation ago. The piously possessive Mrs A is torn between protecting her son and her own reputation; and, when the truth emerges, the situation is saved only by a convenient American heiress who loves the lad to distraction. </p> <p>Wilde's plot, however, is simply the clothes-horse on which he can drape his ideas. And what makes the play so fascinating is that it reveals the endless contradictions of its author. Wilde's charity and justice make him side with the wronged Mrs Arbuthnot and even with the pietistic American who roundly attacks the double standards of English life by which women are shamed and men acclaimed for their sexual indiscretions. But Wilde's aesthetic sympathies are much more engaged by the stylishly amoral Lord Illingworth and by his female counterpart, Mrs Allonby, with her mocking contempt for marriage and for \"poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man\". Wilde's heart lies with the puritans but his head, and his dress-sense, are with the dandies. </p> <p>But the whole play is best enjoyed as a running debate, not least about relations between the sexes. Wilde is palpably on the side of women who risk death in childbirth, social obloquy in their sex lives and boredom in marriage. In one exhilarating scene the women sit down after dinner to air their discontent with the male gender. Yet Wilde also punctures their world of aristocratic privilege and highlights the bizarre comedy of married life. On one level, there is the posturing MP who preaches family values while despatching his wife and eight children to the seaside. Even funnier is the archdeacon whose unseen wife, clearly a close cousin to Lord Bracknell, is a martyr to every ailment known to man or woman. </p> <p>You forgive the sentimental conclusion for the intellectual sparkiness that precedes it. Marianne Elliott's production also neatly combines style with passion. Jonny Phillips's sinisterly smooth Lord Illingworth and Diana Hardcastle's artful Mrs Allonby bat persuasively for the dandies while Geraldine Alexander's impressive Mrs Arbuthnot is all clenched virtue in black velour. Paul Chequer as her bank-clerk son has a hollow-cheeked sincerity reminiscent of the young Tom Courtenay. Richenda Carey as an unflappable hostess and Gaye Brown as a domineering aristo add greatly to the gaiety of a production that reminds us that Wilde's magnetism - in the centenary year of his death - rests on the insoluble paradox of his nature. </p> <p>\u0095Until February 26.

Mr L applies for jobs with Large Public Utility plc, jobs for which he is manifestly unsuited. He applies for these jobs all over the country and each time he gets turned down he makes an application to an employment tribunal, usually alleging race discrimination. </p> <p>So Mr L and I encounter each other in tribunals everywhere - London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds. We exchange pleasantries, then I cross-examine him again about the cases he has brought and lost, and then he loses again. There is a certain satisfying rhythm about these encounters, predictable, courteous. </p> <p>Or there was. Recently, Large Public Utility plc has begun asking for and getting costs orders against Mr L.

Mr L applies for jobs with Large Public Utility plc, jobs for which he is manifestly unsuited. He applies for these jobs all over the country and each time he gets turned down he makes an application to an employment tribunal, usually alleging race discrimination. So Mr L and I encounter each other in tribunals everywhere - London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds. We exchange pleasantries, then I cross-examine him again about the cases he has brought and lost, and then he loses again. There is a certain satisfying rhythm about these encounters, predictable, courteous. Or there was. Recently, Large Public Utility plc has begun asking for and getting costs orders against Mr L. Mr L has responded with a fiendish change of strategy: he is now bringing sex discrimination cases (not usually a great ploy if you are a man).
