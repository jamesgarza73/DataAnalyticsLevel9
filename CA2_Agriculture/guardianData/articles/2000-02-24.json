It is a measure of Nasser Hussain's character that, despite tripping at the two most important of the three hurdles he faced this winter, the England captain returns home tomorrow with his reputation enhanced and his power base greatly strengthened. If senior players absent this winter are to return to the England side, it will be on the captain's terms. </p> <p>After the final one-day international against Zimbabwe was washed out by Cyclone Eline here yesterday, Hussain said: \"We will have to bring back a couple of quality players but we also need to keep the team spirit and the fight we've achieved on this trip. </p> <p>\"There are no excuses now. Duncan [Fletcher, the coach] and I have seen most things. We have seen the experienced players in the past year or so and this winter we have seen the younger ones. Now we must gel the two together and do the best thing for English cricket for the next year. We must be really firm and solid. </p> <p>\"I like volatile players. I like to see people get angry in the dressing room. But we must somehow retain what we have created on this trip. I'll be surprised if we don't reintroduce certain players but it will only happen one or two at a time.\" </p> <p>Hussain is known to admire Thorpe, who made himself unavailable for the Test series in South Africa. He was available for the one-day tournament that followed but the selectors rightly declined the offer. Despite his proven class Thorpe, especially on tour, has been too self-contained and introverted for England's liking. </p> <p>Ramprakash was available but not picked. This was not on grounds of ability; in the past two years he has often been the side's best batsman. But the intensity of his desire to succeed has not always endeared him to the dressing room. </p> <p>Thorpe would help repair the soft centre of England's batting and Ramprakash's best chance is to open alongside Michael Atherton. </p> <p>There are also evangelical whispers about bringing out the best in Graeme Hick. There is not room for all of them, especially with Michael Vaughan deserving a place. But the selectors got England's batting wrong this winter; the quality has been far too thin. </p> <p>\"The middle order does need looking at.\" said Hussain. \"So does the bowling when the ball is doing a bit. We have not always controlled it well. We have to look at no-balls and at handling the pressure. </p> <p>\"In the one-day games we have chased well when we have needed 180 or 190 and Nick Knight and myself have got us off to a good start. But the recent one-day matches have been low-scoring. We must be able to chase 270 or 280 after losing a couple of early wickets. </p> <p>\"I'm not overly pleased with the winter's results. Success is measured in winning series. We lost, then lost the triangular series, where we should have won, before coming here and getting a pleasing 3-0 result. </p> <p>\"But I'm reasonably satisfied with what we've achieved, provided we can go on building. There have been definite successes, including some that others might not view as such; but sometimes there has been something the coach or I have seen that must be stuck by. You have to give people a chance.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Australia equalled the record of 11 successive one-day international wins held by West Indies and England when they beat New Zealand by 50 runs in a day-night match in Dunedin yesterday. Only a 121-run third-wicket stand between Nathan Astle (81) and Roger Twose (62) threatened the visitors after they scored 310 for five. The crowd caused a 15-minute delay by throwing cans and rubbish after Adam Parore was given out hit-wicket when his helmet fell off as he tried to avoid a delivery from Brett Lee.</p>",

Duncan [Fletcher, the coach] and I have seen most things. We have seen the experienced players in the past year or so and this winter we have seen the younger ones. Now we must gel the two together and do the best thing for English cricket for the next year. We must be really firm and solid. \"I like volatile players. I like to see people get angry in the dressing room. But we must somehow retain what we have created on this trip. I'll be surprised if we don't reintroduce certain players but it will only happen one or two at a time.\" Hussain is known to admire Thorpe, who made himself unavailable for the Test series in South Africa. He was available for the one-day tournament that followed but the selectors rightly declined the offer. Despite his proven class Thorpe, especially on tour, has been too self-contained and introverted for England's liking. Ramprakash was available but not picked. This was not on grounds of ability; in the past two years he has often been the side's best batsman. But the intensity of his desire to succeed has not always endeared him to the dressing room. Thorpe would help repair the soft centre of England's batting and Ramprakash's best chance is to open alongside Michael Atherton. There are also evangelical whispers about bringing out the best in Graeme Hick. There is not room for all of them, especially with Michael Vaughan deserving a place. But the selectors got England's batting wrong this winter; the quality has been far too thin. \"The middle order does need looking at.\" said Hussain. \"So does the bowling when the ball is doing a bit. We have not always controlled it well. We have to look at no-balls and at handling the pressure. \"In the one-day games we have chased well when we have needed 180 or 190 and Nick Knight and myself have got us off to a good start. But the recent one-day matches have been low-scoring. We must be able to chase 270 or 280 after losing a couple of early wickets. \"I'm not overly pleased with the winter's results. Success is measured in winning series. We lost, then lost the triangular series, where we should have won, before coming here and getting a pleasing 3-0 result. \"But I'm reasonably satisfied with what we've achieved, provided we can go on building. There have been definite successes, including some that others might not view as such; but sometimes there has been something the coach or I have seen that must be stuck by. You have to give people a chance.\" \u0095 Australia equalled the record of 11 successive one-day international wins held by West Indies and England when they beat New Zealand by 50 runs in a day-night match in Dunedin yesterday. Only a 121-run third-wicket stand between Nathan Astle (81) and Roger Twose (62) threatened the visitors after they scored 310 for five. The crowd caused a 15-minute delay by throwing cans and rubbish after Adam Parore was given out hit-wicket when his helmet fell off as he tried to avoid a delivery from Brett Lee.",

About 70 firefighters and 10 fire appliances were this morning still at the scene damping down the large country house, which was almost totally destroyed by the blaze. Malcolm Eastwood, chief fire officer for Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service, said : \"[The house] has been totally devastated by fire. Around about 95% of the building has been involved in fire and the rest has been smoke damaged. \"The fire had been whipped up by the wind which acted like a blow torch. It was white flame, completely engulfing the house. \"The water supply was totally inadequate as you get in a rural area. We have had to bring in water carriers. \"Initially the call told us that there were two persons reported in the property. \"Crews tried to get into the house on the west side of the building where the people were reported, but were fought back by flames.\" Lizzie Perry, chairwoman of Romsey Conservative Club, confirmed that Mr Colvin and his wife were believed to have been at home last night. She said: \"It is my belief that they were at home last night. We are very, very shocked.\" Ms Perry added that she had spoken to the MP yesterday afternoon and he was in \"good spirits\". Jane Kennedy Scott, a spokeswoman for Hampshire police, said the cause of the fire was not currently being treated as suspicious.",

Marr is one of Britain's - we can, presumably, still use that term - most insightful commentators, as fellow pundit <strong>Matthew Parris</strong> made clear in <strong>the Times</strong>. \"When one learns that the author has 'travelled around the country', 'meeting people', the heart sinks,\" he wrote. \"Meeting which people? Who chose them? Why? But then the eye moves to the author's name: Andrew Marr. The heart lifts. This will be the product of a real mind, a singular literary flair, an integrity still intact. Such an author is capable of stamping a book - maybe even a television series - with an idea.\" </p> <p>And, he concludes, Marr has. \"Shorn of the many intriguing sideways insights the author provides, the central idea is simple, powerful, and finally persuasive: Englishness exists. England's senses of itself go back more than a thousand years, albeit in different forms, and unless England is recognised and given a new sense of its own security, then all hopes for a liberal, open, democratic and tolerant future are in danger... Yet England has been pushed into a corner where it is expected to passively await its future. That, in itself, is dangerous.\" </p> <p> Parris's focus on that strand of Marr's book was perhaps a little perverse: the view from north of the border looked rather different. \"What does it mean to be British, he asks. The answer: not a lot,\" wrote <strong>James Robertson</strong> in <strong>Scotland on Sunday</strong>.</p> <p> \"Almost nothing to most Scots, nor, in fact, to the people hardest hit by the disintegration of the 'British' label, those for whom it has been a threadbare safety net against racism. Many who immigrated between the 50s and 70s, who came as a consequence of the historical fact of empire, now find that the identity they thought was theirs to put on has been discarded by others in favour of Scottish, Welsh and even English ones. </p> <p>\"The term 'British', it is now clear, was created and sustained for only one reason: the empire. Without the empire, it is redundant. Marr puts this into a wider context: the Americanisation of the world; the growth of Asian and Pacific economic power; the end of Communism and the new Europe. Identity is flexible now: all of us have become Europeans and Americans to some extent in the way we live our lives.\"</p> <p>Several reviewers mentioned that the book had evidently been written in a rush (Marr admitted as much in the introduction). \"This book, at first, feels deadeningly over-familiar,\" wrote <strong>Andy Beckett</strong> in <strong>the Guardian</strong>. \"Andrew Marr has produced - at speed - a volume heavily reliant on quotes from his fellow pundits and polemicists. Here are half-page sections and hurried references from Jeremy Paxman's The English, Peter Hitchens's The Abolition of Britain, Simon Heffer's Nor Shall My Sword: The Reinvention of England - all recent books, all concerned with the temperature of the nation in the early fevers of devolution, and all slightly patched together, short on original fact and thought.\"</p> <p>But Beckett quickly warmed to the book, especially when Marr took to the road and started to quote the opinions of anxious Brits. \"The Britain that emerges is mixed-up, complicated, and 'in a state of constant flux',\" concluded Beckett. \"The supposedly cruel capital, for example, absorbs immigrants more easily than allegedly friendlier regions. The English patriots of the Home Counties know more about Normandy than the north of England. The idea of Englishness itself, Marr suggests, may never, at any time, have meant the same thing to everyone. </p> <p>\"His writing relishes these tensions and contradictions: English tabloid culture is neatly summarised as 'swagger and self-pity'; the 'strange, sharp flavour' of modern Britain is crisply evoked. Marr concludes that only a federal country, with separate parliaments for each of its parts, can hope to hold such a hybrid together. He fears a complete break-up, interestingly, for the squeeze it might put on minorities.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Tom Nairn's After Britain: New Labour and the Return of Scotland (Granta, \u00a315.99) got shorter shrift. A ponderous review by <strong>T M Devine</strong> in <strong>the Times</strong> found the book \"eloquent and sophisticated\" but had difficulty explaining why. \"We may indeed be seeing the first stages of a general reconfiguration of relationships within the British archipelago which, inter alia, disperses power from Westminster and by so doing maintains the political links between England and Scotland,\" wrote Devine. </p> <p>\"If London can respond positively and sympathetically to such a dynamic, the best bet for the future is probably a framework of federalism, rather than 'Scottish independence' in the classic form delineated in Tom Nairn's stimulating book.\" I think the publicists will just be satisfied with the word stimulating. </p> <p><strong>Bernard Crick</strong>, in <strong>the Independent</strong>, was less well disposed to Nairn, dismissing his notion that the Scottish people felt the gaping wound of their lost state as \"romantic nonsense\". \"Nairn, amazingly, is an old-fashioned sovereignty man,\" Crick pointed out with a nice touch of irony. \"The British state is worn out, so therefore a Scottish state is needed.\" </p> <p> There was a more generous review in <strong>the Observer</strong>. \"Nairn is certainly a beast seen as fleetingly in these northern islands as the Arctic char or the wild cat - a genuine native intellectual... Nairn is in vintage form, shaking and sharp. He sees the coming English parliament clearly... This is, in short, the most intelligent book on the future of our states.\" So, take that Andrew Marr - you probably thought yours was the number one end-of-Britain tome.

The investigation was launched recently by Patricia Hewitt, the e-commerce minister, and is backed by several large companies who hope to gain from the new marketplace, including Sun Microsystems, the Post Office and the consumer products giant, Unilever. </p> <p>\"The internet is rapidly becoming the most important medium for both interactions and transactions between people and organisations,\" says Shanker Trivedi, vice president for Sun Microsystems in the UK and Ireland. \"We must ensure we are aware of the impact of this new dot.com paradigm on individuals and the environment.\" </p> <p>His concern is that the internet revolution could backfire. Instead of democracy and sustainability, we could end up with social exclusion and new environmental problems. There are clear - potential - social and environmental benefits, but there could also be a black side to the web revolution. The research project will weigh the balance between the positive and negative aspects. First, the dehumanising potential of many \"digital jobs\", set against the potential gains for local economies and smaller firms. </p> <p>There also is the worry that e-shoppers are likely to be the most wealthy, while the poor most desperately need to find bargains. If the e-lite replaces traditional buying with remote shopping, physical shops will be in trouble. They will have less custom to finance their expensive premises. That sounds great if it means an end to hypermarkets on the edge of town which threaten traditional shops. But what if it means closures of high street outlets instead? </p> <p>Next, consider the physical end of the internet transaction. A small number of products can be delivered down the wire - music and software, and potentially anything currently on the written page (such as this newspaper). This is positive for the environment, resulting in lower consumption of materials from newsprint to packaging, and less physical distribution. </p> <p>But most shopping cannot be completed this way. It is useful for small items such as books which can be sent through the post, but bulkier goods such as clothes and food require special deliveries. It is easy to imagine a scenario where this results in greater environmental damage, not less - quite apart from the physical dangers from wild van drivers careering up and down our streets. </p> <p>Shopping remotely, whether through traditional mail order or new media, is more likely to result in dissatisfaction. The colour isn't quite right, the size is wrong. That means more two-way trips. Then there are the items you forget when skipping down Tesco's screen catalogue, which you would spot on the shelves as you struggle past with the trolley. That is another car journey, perhaps. </p> <p>Even worse, it is possible that families freed from the chore of Saturday morning supermarketing will hop in the car and whiz miles down the motorway to some leisure paradise for the day. Finally, the internationalisation of retailing could produce a boom for air freight, as more and more goods are shipped round the world to satisfy shoppers hungry for a bargain and blind to the environmental effects. The range of such issues thrown up by ecommerce is substantial. </p> <p> James Wilsdon, senior policy adviser at Forum for the Future, says : \"The jury is still out on whether the digital economy will evolve into a powerful ally of sustainable development, or a spur to greater social exclusion and environmental destruction. </p> <p>\"There is an urgent need for dialogue between policy-makers and the companies who will be driving the dot.com revolution.\" </p> <p>That dialogue will be achieved by the involvement of eight leading companies. The research will be carried out by a number of think-tanks. Forum for the Future will concentrate on opportunities for eco-efficiency, dematerialisation and the potential shift from products to service-based businesses, while seven other organisations will work on issues such as transport, energy use and carbon dioxide emissions, as well as wider policy issues. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/\" target=\"_new\">The New Economics Foundation (NEF)</a> will look at ways of improving access to the web and the dangers of worsening social exclusion if that cannot be achieved. </p> <p>Alex MacGillivray of NEF said the net had the potential to be positive but without wider access it would remain primarily a middle class phenomenon. \"The purchasing power of buying clubs is fine, but at the moment that is for middle class people. The people who really ought to get the benefits of lower prices are the people who at the moment are the least likely to get online.\" </p> <p>NEF is exploring the potential to open up the net to poorer communities by providing reconditioned computers. Even then there is the question of whether old machines can capitalise on the net's potential. \"You don't want people being on ine but not being able to use the best services\", according to MacGillivray . </p> <p>These complexities will be clearer when the researchers finish their task next year, but much will depend on how e-shopping affects consumers' behaviour. It will take several years for that to emerge.</p>",

Next, consider the physical end of the internet transaction. A small number of products can be delivered down the wire - music and software, and potentially anything currently on the written page (such as this newspaper). This is positive for the environment, resulting in lower consumption of materials from newsprint to packaging, and less physical distribution. But most shopping cannot be completed this way. It is useful for small items such as books which can be sent through the post, but bulkier goods such as clothes and food require special deliveries. It is easy to imagine a scenario where this results in greater environmental damage, not less - quite apart from the physical dangers from wild van drivers careering up and down our streets. Shopping remotely, whether through traditional mail order or new media, is more likely to result in dissatisfaction. The colour isn't quite right, the size is wrong. That means more two-way trips. Then there are the items you forget when skipping down Tesco's screen catalogue, which you would spot on the shelves as you struggle past with the trolley. That is another car journey, perhaps. Even worse, it is possible that families freed from the chore of Saturday morning supermarketing will hop in the car and whiz miles down the motorway to some leisure paradise for the day. Finally, the internationalisation of retailing could produce a boom for air freight, as more and more goods are shipped round the world to satisfy shoppers hungry for a bargain and blind to the environmental effects. The range of such issues thrown up by ecommerce is substantial. James Wilsdon, senior policy adviser at Forum for the Future, says : \"The jury is still out on whether the digital economy will evolve into a powerful ally of sustainable development, or a spur to greater social exclusion and environmental destruction. \"There is an urgent need for dialogue between policy-makers and the companies who will be driving the dot.com revolution.\" That dialogue will be achieved by the involvement of eight leading companies. The research will be carried out by a number of think-tanks. Forum for the Future will concentrate on opportunities for eco-efficiency, dematerialisation and the potential shift from products to service-based businesses, while seven other organisations will work on issues such as transport, energy use and carbon dioxide emissions, as well as wider policy issues. The New Economics Foundation (NEF) will look at ways of improving access to the web and the dangers of worsening social exclusion if that cannot be achieved. Alex MacGillivray of NEF said the net had the potential to be positive but without wider access it would remain primarily a middle class phenomenon. \"The purchasing power of buying clubs is fine, but at the moment that is for middle class people. The people who really ought to get the benefits of lower prices are the people who at the moment are the least likely to get online.\" NEF is exploring the potential to open up the net to poorer communities by providing reconditioned computers. Even then there is the question of whether old machines can capitalise on the net's potential. \"You don't want people being on ine but not being able to use the best services\", according to MacGillivray . These complexities will be clearer when the researchers finish their task next year, but much will depend on how e-shopping affects consumers' behaviour. It will take several years for that to emerge.",

      "body": "<p>This week the supermarkets announced a price war, but you don't have to be a cynic to wonder why. Their prices are under intense scrutiny from the department of trade and industry. This week, as the row about \"rip off Britain\" rumbles on, the Competition Commission suddenly announced that it was looking into the issue of local monopolies. If companies are abusing their power at a local level, it will force them to sell some of their stores. In an apparent attempt to win back their approval rating, the supermarkets have responded with a price war. </p> <p>A few pence off Flora is all very well, but it is nothing compared with what we had been promised. There was a time when the supermarkets and chain stores seemed determined to be the consumers' friend, by selling designer goods at discount prices. But what was once feted as a flood, has been reduced to a trickle. </p> <p>In 1991, Superdrug became the first major retailer to undercut high-street prices for branded goods by buying perfume from overseas factories and retailers with excess stock (a trading area known as the \"grey market\", or parallel imports). Slowly others followed suit. In 1997, Tesco bought a large supply of Levi's jeans and sold them for \u00a315 less than normal high-street prices. This, we were told, was a war being fought on our behalf by the large supermarkets against price-fixing designer labels to ensure we got the best deals. </p> <p>Since then Asda, Sainsbury and Safeway have joined in the fun and bought up the odd batch of grey market Calvin Klein, Sony and Tommy Hilfiger clobber, but your average punter would have been very lucky to get on the right end of any of these bargain-basement deals. For all the hype from the \"consumers champions\" you would be hard pushed to believe that the supermarkets were scouring the world for the best deals judging by their stock. </p> <p>Tesco have recently offered some cheap Nike trainers; Asda have had some cheap sunglasses, but the pickings are few and far between. Tesco say they save the consumer \u00a332,000 per day with grey market imports. It sounds great, but actually works out at about 23p per person per year. Moreover, even though Superdrug has forced Givenchy and Yves St Laurent to supply them directly, it no longer claims to be the cheapest operation in town. </p> <p>So what's gone wrong with our brave new world of cheapo Levi's? Well, for one thing, the designer brands don't like it. They argue that selling their products in the supermarket devalues their brands and that consumers need high levels of sales advice and service. But since a survey commissioned by the Consumers' Association in December last year indicates precisely the opposite, one can only conclude that their principal objection to the grey market is that it robs them of the ability to determine the price. </p> <p>Every time a supermarket dabbles in the grey market, the designers take legal action. Sony won a high court injunction against Tesco over PlayStation, and Tommy Hilfiger, Nike, Levis and Adidas have all reached out-of-court settlements with various supermarkets. </p> <p>Brussels is also firmly on the designers' side. In a landmark ruling at the European Court of Justice last year, the judges (using a piece of trademark legislation that was ironically intended to protect the consumer) effectively prohibited the importation of goods without the manufacturers' consent. And you can bet your life they won't give in. </p> <p>Gary Lux, chairman of the European Parallel Importers Coalition, believes that such protectionism is blatantly anti-competitive. Moreover he reckons the brands want to have it both ways. \"We know that when some brands have excess stock, they secretly release it on to the grey market,\" he says. \"They're actually happy with the deal as they are getting a fair price. But when it reappears in another market, they cry foul.\" </p> <p>Last year, following the EU ruling, a select committee of the department of trade and industry came down on the consumers' side, and recommended that the restrictions on designer goods sourced from outside the EU should be scrapped. But the road to European law is immensely bureaucratic and torturously slow. And given that last week it was revealed that the DTI had rigged its survey to prove that \"rip-off Britain\" is a myth by excluding a large number of awkward items, one perhaps should not expect any urgent action. </p> <p>What, then, can you do? If the goods won't come to you at the right price, then you can go to them. Logically, the easiest way ought to be through the internet. After all, what's to stop you clicking straight on to Guess? in the US and buying at the rock bottom stateside prices. Well, quite a lot actually. Guess? have gone out of their way to ring-fence their site to keep out unwanted Brits. And everyone else, for that matter. We can look, but not touch. No orders are shipped outside the US. The same goes for other designer labels. Territories are defended just as zealously in cyberspace as they are in the high street. </p> <p>You won't necessarily have any more luck if you try the retailers themselves. The first page you hit when you type in <a href=\"dressmart.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Dressmart.com</a> - a site which offers a bespoke tailoring service for brands, such as Gieves &amp; Hawkes, Mulbery and Aquascutum - is one which asks you to click on one of the seven countries listed: the UK, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Finland or Norway. If you're not from any of these, then too bad. You'll have to go elsewhere. More disappointingly still, even though six of the seven countries are within the EU there are no benefits of membership. You still have to pay the going rate for each territory. </p> <p>Maria Dall, the marketing director for dressmart.com in the UK, explains her company's rationale. \"We believe that designers have a right to control their e-commerce,\" she says. \"We need to respect that right and don't want to jeopardise their standards. We only sell in territories for which we have permission. We don't want to undercut their high-street outlets. We believe the internet is about ease and convenience, not discounting.\" </p> <p>This is rather one in the eye for those of us who hoped that it might be about all three things, and it is something of a relief to find one rag trade site that thinks so too. <a href=\"zercon.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Zercon.com</a> is Shaun Dunn's baby. He sells all the big names, such as Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, DKNY and Versace and freely admits he sources everything on the internal European grey market through agents and middlemen. \"It's sometimes a bit hit and miss, because you have to take what you can get,\" he says. \"Sometimes it's this season's fashions, sometimes it's older stuff. But it's fine by me, as not everyone wants the latest fashions, and I can sell everything for roughly half the high-street prices.\" How long zercon.com survives is another matter. As sure as eggs is eggs the designer labels will do their utmost to squeeze his supply chain. </p> <p>Life is distinctly rosier if you are not a slave to branding. Companies such as Matalan buy bulk imports of clothing from the far east which they sell for knock-down prices. You needn't worry about the quality or sticking out like a sore thumb, either - everyone's wearing them. Peacock, which sources a small percentage of goods from the grey market, and Matalan are two of the few clothes retailers to have bucked the national trend and increased turnover in the last year. </p> <p>Of course, there's always abroad. Other than fags, booze and new transport, you can bring back whatever you like from inside the EU. For example, there are extremely cheap flights to Ireland where the exchange rate may net you a 30% reduction on some makes of computers. And if you happen to be going to the US or the Far East anyway, feel free to stock up and pay any duty on your return. </p> <p>But if this seems like the answer to all your prayers, then remember this. Not all electronic goods are compatible throughout the world and all product complaints have to be referred back to the country in which they were bought. The Consumer Association says that while abroad you should always pay for goods in excess of \u00a3100 by credit card as, in theory, the card issuer is jointly liable with the supplier. Needless to say, this may be harder to enforce in practice. So, for the time being, it's business as normal. Caveat emptor.</p>",

In 1991, Superdrug became the first major retailer to undercut high-street prices for branded goods by buying perfume from overseas factories and retailers with excess stock (a trading area known as the \"grey market\", or parallel imports). Slowly others followed suit. In 1997, Tesco bought a large supply of Levi's jeans and sold them for \u00a315 less than normal high-street prices. This, we were told, was a war being fought on our behalf by the large supermarkets against price-fixing designer labels to ensure we got the best deals. Since then Asda, Sainsbury and Safeway have joined in the fun and bought up the odd batch of grey market Calvin Klein, Sony and Tommy Hilfiger clobber, but your average punter would have been very lucky to get on the right end of any of these bargain-basement deals. For all the hype from the \"consumers champions\" you would be hard pushed to believe that the supermarkets were scouring the world for the best deals judging by their stock. Tesco have recently offered some cheap Nike trainers; Asda have had some cheap sunglasses, but the pickings are few and far between. Tesco say they save the consumer \u00a332,000 per day with grey market imports. It sounds great, but actually works out at about 23p per person per year. Moreover, even though Superdrug has forced Givenchy and Yves St Laurent to supply them directly, it no longer claims to be the cheapest operation in town. So what's gone wrong with our brave new world of cheapo Levi's? Well, for one thing, the designer brands don't like it. They argue that selling their products in the supermarket devalues their brands and that consumers need high levels of sales advice and service. But since a survey commissioned by the Consumers' Association in December last year indicates precisely the opposite, one can only conclude that their principal objection to the grey market is that it robs them of the ability to determine the price. Every time a supermarket dabbles in the grey market, the designers take legal action. Sony won a high court injunction against Tesco over PlayStation, and Tommy Hilfiger, Nike, Levis and Adidas have all reached out-of-court settlements with various supermarkets. Brussels is also firmly on the designers' side. In a landmark ruling at the European Court of Justice last year, the judges (using a piece of trademark legislation that was ironically intended to protect the consumer) effectively prohibited the importation of goods without the manufacturers' consent. And you can bet your life they won't give in. Gary Lux, chairman of the European Parallel Importers Coalition, believes that such protectionism is blatantly anti-competitive. Moreover he reckons the brands want to have it both ways. \"We know that when some brands have excess stock, they secretly release it on to the grey market,\" he says. \"They're actually happy with the deal as they are getting a fair price. But when it reappears in another market, they cry foul.\" Last year, following the EU ruling, a select committee of the department of trade and industry came down on the consumers' side, and recommended that the restrictions on designer goods sourced from outside the EU should be scrapped. But the road to European law is immensely bureaucratic and torturously slow. And given that last week it was revealed that the DTI had rigged its survey to prove that \"rip-off Britain\" is a myth by excluding a large number of awkward items, one perhaps should not expect any urgent action. What, then, can you do? If the goods won't come to you at the right price, then you can go to them. Logically, the easiest way ought to be through the internet. After all, what's to stop you clicking straight on to Guess? in the US and buying at the rock bottom stateside prices. Well, quite a lot actually. Guess? have gone out of their way to ring-fence their site to keep out unwanted Brits. And everyone else, for that matter. We can look, but not touch. No orders are shipped outside the US. The same goes for other designer labels. Territories are defended just as zealously in cyberspace as they are in the high street. You won't necessarily have any more luck if you try the retailers themselves. The first page you hit when you type in Dressmart.com - a site which offers a bespoke tailoring service for brands, such as Gieves &amp; Hawkes, Mulbery and Aquascutum - is one which asks you to click on one of the seven countries listed: the UK, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Finland or Norway. If you're not from any of these, then too bad. You'll have to go elsewhere. More disappointingly still, even though six of the seven countries are within the EU there are no benefits of membership. You still have to pay the going rate for each territory. Maria Dall, the marketing director for dressmart.com in the UK, explains her company's rationale. \"We believe that designers have a right to control their e-commerce,\" she says. \"We need to respect that right and don't want to jeopardise their standards. We only sell in territories for which we have permission. We don't want to undercut their high-street outlets. We believe the internet is about ease and convenience, not discounting.\" This is rather one in the eye for those of us who hoped that it might be about all three things, and it is something of a relief to find one rag trade site that thinks so too. Zercon.com is Shaun Dunn's baby. He sells all the big names, such as Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, DKNY and Versace and freely admits he sources everything on the internal European grey market through agents and middlemen. \"It's sometimes a bit hit and miss, because you have to take what you can get,\" he says. \"Sometimes it's this season's fashions, sometimes it's older stuff. But it's fine by me, as not everyone wants the latest fashions, and I can sell everything for roughly half the high-street prices.\" How long zercon.com survives is another matter. As sure as eggs is eggs the designer labels will do their utmost to squeeze his supply chain. Life is distinctly rosier if you are not a slave to branding. Companies such as Matalan buy bulk imports of clothing from the far east which they sell for knock-down prices. You needn't worry about the quality or sticking out like a sore thumb, either - everyone's wearing them. Peacock, which sources a small percentage of goods from the grey market, and Matalan are two of the few clothes retailers to have bucked the national trend and increased turnover in the last year. Of course, there's always abroad. Other than fags, booze and new transport, you can bring back whatever you like from inside the EU. For example, there are extremely cheap flights to Ireland where the exchange rate may net you a 30% reduction on some makes of computers. And if you happen to be going to the US or the Far East anyway, feel free to stock up and pay any duty on your return. But if this seems like the answer to all your prayers, then remember this. Not all electronic goods are compatible throughout the world and all product complaints have to be referred back to the country in which they were bought. The Consumer Association says that while abroad you should always pay for goods in excess of \u00a3100 by credit card as, in theory, the card issuer is jointly liable with the supplier. Needless to say, this may be harder to enforce in practice. So, for the time being, it's business as normal. Caveat emptor.",

We cannot answer until we know how many gay men and women there are - and we don't. It could be as many as one in 10 of the population, giving a UK total of 6m adults. The box shows how estimates vary: yet another study estimated that only 500,000 adult men in England could be defined as gay - if that means those homosexually active during the 12 months prior to the survey. But this survey asked about any sexual experience between two people of the same gender, which does not necessarily indicate orientation. If people were asked to label themselves as heterosexual, bisexual and homosexual, a much lower gay percentage might result. </p> <p>As for gays' economic status, Gay Times conducted a self-completion survey of its readership in 1993 and 1998. Channel 4 organised a self-completion survey in the mid 90s. Both samples centred on white, middle-class men. Gay Times found they had income higher than average but Channel 4 suggested their income was lower than average - so much for popular beliefs about the pink pound. These samples, however, were of people frequenting gay venues and they may not be typical. </p> <p>Methodological problems have not, however, stopped the press from asserting the pink pound is big and bouncy. The London Evening Standard recently asserted that 77% of gays fall into ABC1 economic groups.

So with no real information on numbers, potential and actual spending, lifestyle and behavioural differences and other relevant trend data, most judgments about gays' economic strength are based on anecdote plus some obvious knowledge of gay lifestyles - for example gays tend not to have children. That gays have a propensity to consume more than average amounts of alcohol is based on observations of London's Soho (Compton Street), Manchester's gay village (Canal Street), Brighton, Glasgow and now Newcastle upon Tyne. Typical? </p> <p>But if the pink pound is a myth, that does not mean there is not a gay market. There is certainly a gay press. Gay Times has a circulation of about 65,000; Attitude 55,000; and Diva 35,000. (Although there are several weekly and monthly free titles, such as Boyz and the Pink Paper, their product advertising is limited). </p> <p>The gay press advertises gay products and services to gay readers but also mainstream drink, fragrances, clothing, music, books, tobacco and entertainment. Also, many of those involved in research for (and the production of) drugs to combat HIV also advertise. </p> <p>Additionally, some products are advertised in the context of gay-themed television, for example Queer as Folk on Channel 4. During the first series (March/April 1999) and its subsequent repeat (January 2000) adverts included Carling, Guinness, Lion bars and Vodafone. The diversity was justified since anecdotal evidence suggests the 2.1m audience was mixed in sexual orientation. </p> <p>Besides the media, gay festivals are hosted up and down the country. Again sponsors are spread between the obvious \"leisure\" industries (drink and tobacco) and mainstream suppliers of cars, air travel and internet services. The London lesbian and gay film festival, now in its 13th year, counts Channel 4, Stella Artois, American Airlines, Time Out and the Canadian High Commission among its backers. Business backs gay charity: WH Smith and the Halifax have assisted the National Aids Trust and NatWest has sponsored several events for the Stonewall Trust. </p> <p>Is all this, then, a sign of identifiable pink purchasing? Drink companies are definitely targeting gay men and women. Bass Brewers, for example, own and run some 24 or so pubs and clubs dedicated to a gay clientele. But alcohol aside, and the near isolated strategy of Virgin Megastores who run specific gay shopping evening events in one or two of their stores, representatives from other industries are very sparse in terms of overt marketing to the gay consumer. The argument is that overt advertising of any kind can both be divisive and damaging to the brand. </p> <p>We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with leading advertising agents and found few could recollect any instances where campaigns directly targeted at gay men and women were part of their or the clients' strategy. Take the latest series of ads for Impulse deodorant. The two gay characters are part of the plot, yes, but they do not detract from the brand. It is part of a series of ads which are humorous, with that required twist reflecting 90s' attitudes and values, but still focus on the product itself. When gay men are asked, they say they are not prepared to support products or brands that overtly targeted them. </p> <p>In fact, both heterosexuals and gay people see very little relevance in categorising individuals on the basis of their sexual inclinations. In today's fragmented and complex world we all need to connect to multiple references in order to build a balanced and gratifying sense of identity.

The studios keep an eye out for novelty hits to rework as Billy Crystal vehicles, while ambitious auteurs dutifully sign up to make travesties of their own best work. </p> <p>This week we can ponder the future of another candidate for the mill. Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar has already sold the remake rights to his film Open Your Eyes to Tom Cruise. Whether or not the remake ever happens, Amenabar has now bought himself enough credit to make his next film in English with Nicole Kidman. The Others will be a French-Spanish co-production, backed by Miramax. </p> <p>Is Amenabar, 27, tough enough to work the system? Soft-spoken and slight, he speaks English fluently but with a touch of nerves. He looks as though he should still be working on his first-year student short. But at the age of 23 he had already completed his first feature, Tesis, an intelligent psychological thriller about snuff films. He not only wrote and directed it but composed the score. As a student, he taught himself soundtrack writing because he didn't trust anyone else to get the feel he wanted. </p> <p>He's hard-headed, then, and has already learned to deal with both success and hostility. Open Your Eyes was hugely popular in Spain, but Amenabar took much flak from critics who accused him of not being a sufficiently Spanish director. He's not particularly, he admits. Among his current peers, he feels affinity with Basque director Julio Medem, whose recent Lovers of the Arctic Circle shares two of its stars with Open Your Eyes. But above all he worships the trinity of Hitchcock, Kubrick and Spielberg. </p> <p>Open Your Eyes is a labyrinthine story about a young man who's horribly disfigured, then miraculously reconstituted, and about two women, one of whom may be a double of the other. Put like this, it makes little sense, but on screen Amenabar breaks and remakes his own narrative rules with supreme confidence. </p> <p>It's about fooling the viewer, he explains. \"As the title says, it's a film in which you have to keep your eyes wide open. As the main character goes crazy, the audience is supposed to go crazy. It's risky - part of the audience can get sick watching the film. It's also a film to be seen at least three times, then you can get the whole. Of course, it's not a film for children.\" </p> <p>The film's most outrageous stroke is an 11th-hour turn towards sci-fi in the form of cryogenics - the freezing of a human in an attempt to cheat death. \"I wanted to take the science-fiction world and put it into everyday reality,\" Amenabar says. He admits that the ending provoked much laughter at the film's premiere. Yet it is grounded in fact, he insists. He did extensive research into the subject. \"It was very impressive. You can have the whole body frozen, or just the head, which is cheaper.\" </p> <p>Born in Chile but raised in Madrid, Amenabar came to film through the horror-video collection of the Americans next door. He studied film at Madrid's Universidad Complutense, where he met his friend and close collaborator Mateo Gil, co-writer of Open Your Eyes and now a director in his own right. But he failed the directing course in his fifth year, and is still fuming about it. He got his revenge when he made Tesis, naming the serial killer after the teacher who failed him. He apologised later, he says. </p> <p>Tesis was a taut, paranoid speculation on voyeurism and violence, in the Peeping Tom tradition. Amenabar admits he didn't do much solid research on snuff movies - \"I just read a book and some news, and of course I wouldn't have dared to get into that world. For me it's creepy and disgusting.\" </p> <p>As for the existence of snuff movies - generally regarded by commentators as a ghoulish urban myth - he says that if you can imagine the worst, then it probably happens. \"A human being for me is the most horrible thing in the world, the thing I'm most afraid of. But that's not the question in the film - the question is how the media treat violence. After the film was released, there were a lot of Spanish TV films treating violence very morbidly - really, really disgusting. I don't know who decides that when somebody falls down from a building they just have to repeat it and repeat it and repeat it.\" </p> <p>Amenabar doesn't offer any clues to whether his next film will be as mind-bending as his first two. Budgeted at around $15m - about 10 times as much as Open Your Eyes - The Others is set in post-war Jersey, although shot in northern Spain, and will be a ghost story about \"a sort of neurotic woman - she's Catholic, and she hears noises upstairs\". </p> <p>He realises that working with a big name like Nicole Kidman will require a whole new field of management expertise. \"She's a star but I want to keep this film away from the Hollywood system. To me it's a temptation, and at the same time it can be a nightmare. I know so many directors from so many countries have failed trying to get in the system: they feel they've been betrayed. I don't want my career to be like that. I'm very concerned about how this film should be sold to the audience, but I don't want a group of 20 people giving opinions.\" The challenge, he says, is: \"We have to understand that it's a film with Nicole Kidman, and she has to understand - I think she does - that it's a Spanish film.\" </p> <p>Amenabar is either very naive or a deceptively tough cookie. There's always the chance, of course, that his imagination may simply prove too strange for Hollywood. But he's probably doing the right thing sticking to the thriller genre, which has seen him all right so far. \"For me, it's the easiest way to express my obsessions. But I think this next one, and maybe another one, and then I'll have to wash my brain and change my ideas.\" And if he can wash Hollywood's brain a little in the process, then so much the better. </p> <p>Open Your Eyes is out on Friday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Michael Colvin, the Conservative MP missing and feared dead with his wife after a fire at his home in the Hampshire village of Tangley, is known throughout Westminster as a Tory of the old school. The wealthy 67-year-old landowner, the son of a Royal Navy captain, was educated at Eton and Sandhurst. He went on to become a captain in the Grenadier Guards serving in Berlin, the Suez campaign and Cyprus, turning to property investment and farming when he left the army. His first move into politics came in 1964 when he served on Tangley Parish Council in his home village. He then climbed through the ranks of being a district councillor, county councillor and on to the Conservative Research Department before being selected as candidate for the seat of Bristol North West. He captured the seat in the Thatcher landslide of 1979 but was regarded inside the Commons as a \"wet\" with limited chances of promotion inside her government. In 1983 he switched to safer seat of Romsey and Waterside in Hampshire - later known as Romsey - where he had a majority at the last election of 8,585. In parliament he took an interest in foreign affairs, becoming chairman of the Conservative Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Committee. He supported trade links with South Africa and urged recognition of the \"homelands\" set up for black South Africans by the government. But he was mainly known as a defence and aviation expert, becoming chairman of the Defence Select Committee in 1995. He is president of the Westminster Shooting Club and captain of the House of Commons team and was involved in resisting attempts, in the wake of the Dunblane massacre, to close down the club. He hit the headlines in 1997 when he was convicted of polluting a village water supply by discharging 200,000 gallons of waste water from a slurry pit on his 855-acre Home Farm in Tangley. In 1994 the low-profile MP was caught up in the Tory sleaze row over claims that he failed to declare a consultancy with a South African public relations firm. He is chairman of the Council for Country Sports and spent eight years as vice-chairman of the British Field Sports Society. He once bought the village pub, The Cricketers Arms, to save it from closure. Said to be a close friend of the Prince of Wales, he is also a qualified pilot, parachutist and a keen artist.",

Except this time he will not make the mistake of starting its life in the hostile environment of the House of Lords.</p> <p>Instead, it is to be forced first through the House of Commons under the protection of Labour's 170-strong majority. The idea is that with an overwhelming endorsement by the elected chamber, the upper house, even after the hereditary peers have been slung out, will not feel able to reject it a second time.</p> <p>It would then turn into a battle between the democratic Commons and the unelected House of Lords. That at least is the current Straw plan.</p> <p>But trouble has already reared its head for Mr Straw in the shape of a Commons rebellion led by the Labour barrister and MP for Medway, Robert Marshall-Andrews, and the Old Etonian Labour MP for Stoke on Trent Central, Mark Fisher, which has already attracted the support of 57 other Labour MPs.</p> <p>It threatens to reduce Labour's Commons majority for the bill to such an unimpressive level that the House of Lords would feel justified in throwing out the measure once again.</p> <p>So what is all about? Well, defendants accused of serious crimes are sent straight to the crown court to be tried by a jury. Those accused of minor offences have their cases heard by the magistrates.</p> <p>But there is a group of \"middle-ranking\" offences such as burglary and theft where defendants - about 18,000 a year - currently have the choice as to which court hears their cases.</p> <p>Jack Straw says that hardened criminals use this choice to abuse the system and waste time in the hope that a gullible jury will acquit them. He claims that scrapping the right to choose jury trial will save more than \u00a3100m a year.</p> <p>In order to achieve this, the bill contains a test \"of reputation and livelihood\". This was designed to ensure that those who had no previous convictions, a full-time job and a nice home got a jury trial, while the persistent offender was not allowed to play the system and confined to a hearing in the much cheaper magistrates court.</p> <p>This has led to complaints of two-tier justice whereby a bank manager will automatically enjoy a jury trial, while the homeless and unemployed will be banned from access to the crown court. Mr Straw will announce this afternoon he is dropping this test.</p> <p>But his critics maintain this will do little to undermine the basic principle of the bill which they argue removes a fundamental civil liberty.</p> <p>Watch out for more fireworks to come as you witness the spectacle of Jack Straw's bill being shot down in flames for a second time.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/jury/\">Trial by jury: special report</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/hsecom.htm\" target=\"new\">House of Commons </a></p>",

This seems to be a clear case of the home secretary failing to heed the old political adage: \"When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.\" The warning signs were clear enough when his own loyal backbenchers in the House of Lords, including many new Labour peers, such as Baroness Kennedy, joined Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and crossbenchers and threw out the entire mode of trial bill by a majority of 96 a month ago. It was the first time since legislation paving the way for the abolition of the Greater London council in 1984 that a government bill had been killed in the House of Lords. But instead of waiting a year, as Lady Thatcher had done when she suffered one of her most humiliating parliamentary defeats, Jack Straw pressed on and today will publish his mode of trial (number two) bill.

But trouble has already reared its head for Mr Straw in the shape of a Commons rebellion led by the Labour barrister and MP for Medway, Robert Marshall-Andrews, and the Old Etonian Labour MP for Stoke on Trent Central, Mark Fisher, which has already attracted the support of 57 other Labour MPs. It threatens to reduce Labour's Commons majority for the bill to such an unimpressive level that the House of Lords would feel justified in throwing out the measure once again. So what is all about? Well, defendants accused of serious crimes are sent straight to the crown court to be tried by a jury. Those accused of minor offences have their cases heard by the magistrates. But there is a group of \"middle-ranking\" offences such as burglary and theft where defendants - about 18,000 a year - currently have the choice as to which court hears their cases. Jack Straw says that hardened criminals use this choice to abuse the system and waste time in the hope that a gullible jury will acquit them. He claims that scrapping the right to choose jury trial will save more than \u00a3100m a year. In order to achieve this, the bill contains a test \"of reputation and livelihood\". This was designed to ensure that those who had no previous convictions, a full-time job and a nice home got a jury trial, while the persistent offender was not allowed to play the system and confined to a hearing in the much cheaper magistrates court. This has led to complaints of two-tier justice whereby a bank manager will automatically enjoy a jury trial, while the homeless and unemployed will be banned from access to the crown court. Mr Straw will announce this afternoon he is dropping this test. But his critics maintain this will do little to undermine the basic principle of the bill which they argue removes a fundamental civil liberty. Watch out for more fireworks to come as you witness the spectacle of Jack Straw's bill being shot down in flames for a second time. Useful links Trial by jury: special report House of Commons",

Yet he had to wait many years for recognition outside Poland. The films that brought him into prominence were the Decalogue, loose commentaries on the Ten Commandments, originally made for Polish television. Each hour-long film was set within the same Warsaw suburb, and the whole project took 18 months to shoot. Two of them were extended by Kieslowski into features - A Short Film About Killing and A Short Film About Love. They illustrated \"thou shalt not kill\" and \"thou shalt not commit adultery\", and either would be candidates for my 100 best list. </p> <p>I choose Killing because of the furore it caused in some circles. In Poland, the film was instrumental in the abolition of the death penalty. But not everybody admired it. At Cannes, it only received the minor Jury Prize; one juror called it a second-rate copy of an American film and another said that it should be banned outright. </p> <p>Only myself and Henning Carlsen, the Danish director, supported it. We nominated it for Best Film - a choice of which its opponents approved, thinking it would have no chance of that award with the final jury. To everyone's surprise, Kieslowski won. </p> <p>The film is not easy to watch, being the story of a lumpen young man who kills a taxi driver and is caught, brought to trial, condemned to death and executed. Both deaths are dreadful; Kieslowski is clearly trying to tell us that both are morally repugnant. The taxi driver is battered with a stone and dies slowly, while the long-winded bureaucratic precision of the hanging was apparently so horrendous to film that Kieslowski's team had to break off in the middle. </p> <p>It should be emphasised, though, that the two most violent scenes are not lingered over. We see neither too little nor too much. They are there to shock us, but for a good reason. What makes them powerful is the rest of the film. It is shot by Slavomir Idziak with the aid of lowering, ochre-coloured filters that render the young man's world like a purgatorial nightmare. Never has Warsaw and its environs looked so depressing. </p> <p>The murderer has come from a bad home and his lack of education is palpable. He is a pathetic figure who would seem set for a life of tragedy. Not for a moment does the film let us off the hook, and the atmosphere it sustains is one of the most menacing I've encountered. </p> <p>Most considering the work of this outstanding director would probably choose a film from his later Three Colours Trilogy, made largely in France. Brilliant as these were, his style became too refined, sometimes dominating the content. While it is almost impossible to conceive of Kieslowski making a bad film, in the Decalogue, and particularly in Killing, style and content were perfectly matched.</p>",

It should be emphasised, though, that the two most violent scenes are not lingered over. We see neither too little nor too much. They are there to shock us, but for a good reason. What makes them powerful is the rest of the film. It is shot by Slavomir Idziak with the aid of lowering, ochre-coloured filters that render the young man's world like a purgatorial nightmare. Never has Warsaw and its environs looked so depressing. The murderer has come from a bad home and his lack of education is palpable. He is a pathetic figure who would seem set for a life of tragedy. Not for a moment does the film let us off the hook, and the atmosphere it sustains is one of the most menacing I've encountered. Most considering the work of this outstanding director would probably choose a film from his later Three Colours Trilogy, made largely in France. Brilliant as these were, his style became too refined, sometimes dominating the content. While it is almost impossible to conceive of Kieslowski making a bad film, in the Decalogue, and particularly in Killing, style and content were perfectly matched.",

There is to be a further hearing to determine the exact amount of the claim against the Spice Girls. Aprilia sought damages of \u00a3434,564 or \u00a31m depending on whether it could establish its claim for misrepresentation or breach of contract. The Spice Girls launched a claim against Aprilia for \u00a3212,000 in unpaid sponsorship and royalty fees but this was dismissed. The motorcycle firm responded with its own action. Aprilia had a \u00a3500,000 deal with the group to promote its products (including a Spice Sonic scooter featuring a picture of all five singers), and says that Geri Halliwell's departure cost it \u00a31.6m in lost profits. The company claims the Girls were aware that Ms Halliwell intended to leave when they signed the sponsorship deal. The judge, Mrs Justice Arden, said there was an implied misrepresentation. Ms Halliwell left the group after logos had been designed and the advertisement completed. She said Aprilia would not have entered into the agreement to provide the Spice Girls with \u00a3450,000 in sponsorship fees and \u00a3112,000 in guaranteed royalties on the scooter if it had known that a member of the band was leaving at the end of May 1998. During the hearing, Ms Halliwell said it had \"not even crossed my mind\" that the scooter's logo would be out of date if she were to leave the band. She had told the four other Girls in March 1998 that she wanted to leave in September, but admitted that they had probably not taken her seriously. Baby Spice Emma Bunton confirmed in court that they had never thought Ms Halliwell would abandon the band. \"Things were said quite flippantly at the time,\" she told the court, confessing that she had a \"terrible memory\". When Ms Halliwell left the band in May 1998, Aprilia decided not to settle the balance of sponsorship fees. The company had incurred large costs in marketing material and producing the Spice Sonic scooter.

The actor had been due to star in the controversial overview of the drugs war in America but pulled out in order to commit to an as-yet-unnamed other project, Variety reported last night. </p> <p>Ford's eleventh hour departure has thrown the Fox Searchlight production into crisis. According to sources, Traffic is due to go before the cameras on April 2 and the studio is desperately casting around for a star to fill Ford's shoes. Al Pacino, Tommy Lee Jones and (more worryingly) Kevin Costner are among the big names said to have expressed an interest.</p> <p>Loosely based on an acclaimed BBC mini-series, Traffic was to have heralded a bracing change of direction for Ford.

      "bodyText": "Harrison Ford has bailed out of the Steven Soderbergh picture Traffic. The actor had been due to star in the controversial overview of the drugs war in America but pulled out in order to commit to an as-yet-unnamed other project, Variety reported last night. Ford's eleventh hour departure has thrown the Fox Searchlight production into crisis. According to sources, Traffic is due to go before the cameras on April 2 and the studio is desperately casting around for a star to fill Ford's shoes. Al Pacino, Tommy Lee Jones and (more worryingly) Kevin Costner are among the big names said to have expressed an interest. Loosely based on an acclaimed BBC mini-series, Traffic was to have heralded a bracing change of direction for Ford. Last month saw the actor sign up with an agency for the first time in fifteen years with the aim of gaining access to riskier, less formulaic pictures. Scripted by Steve Gaghan, Traffic looked to fit the bill perfectly, with its no-holds-barred assault on the drugs trade in the US and an ambitious, maverick director in Steven Soderbergh. Ford was to have played the role of Robert Lewis, a district judge appointed as a drugs tzar whose war on the narcotics trade is undermined when his 16 year old daughter becomes addicted to crack cocaine. Catherine Zeta-Jones is pencilled in to co-star as the unsuspecting wife of a cocaine dealer, but Ford's departure is rumoured to have weakened her own commitment to the project. As reported in Film Unlimited last week, Ford was said to have become frustrated with the slow pace at which Traffic was progressing and had become bogged down in protracted salary negotiations with Fox, who were determined that the film should keep within a small-scale budget of $30-40m. But these negotiations had been resolved at the tail-end of last week and the film looked set to begin production with Ford on board. Inevitably, commentators are already speculating that Ford got cold feet over Traffic's content and has retreated to the safer, more conservative, and better paid world of mainstream movie-making. Last night his long-term manager Pat McQueeny confirmed that the actor had left Traffic in order to make \"an action film\", widely believed to be either the next Jack Ryan movie or the next Indiana Jones movie.",

South West Trains staff in Portsmouth then endeavoured to enlighten her. The ticket was valid for Virgin but only on trains routed via Northampton.

And, apparently, it's perfectly simple to find out what is and isn't allowed. \"Ask at the ticket office,\" says the spokesman. \"They'll tell you.\" The trouble is they get the information from the routing guide which no one understands.

Opta Soccer West Brom will bid for Barnsley's Trinidad and Tobago international striker Clint Marcelle. Marcelle has not played for the Tykes under Dave Bassett and Albion manager Brian Little looks set to seal a short-term deal today. Albion chairman John Wile told the club's official website: \"There is a slight hold-up with the work permit, but all being well, we'll complete the move.\" Daily Star Southampton defender Richard Dryden is considering a loan move to Oxford.",

Finally, he says, without much hope in his voice: \"Is Our Friends in the North junk?\" </p> <p>If such a thing were possible, Michael Ignatieff has, over the past 10 years, become even more like Michael Ignatieff. In 1990, around which time, as one of The Late Show's reviled presenters, he first became an icon of high-mindedness, A Day in the Life found him \"pottering along\" in a big Victorian house, full of the smells of cooking and the shrieks of small children. </p> <p>These days, a commentator on the philosophy of war, the philosophy of nationalism, the philosophy of human rights, he resides in a warehouse in that hip triangle of London between Hoxton and the City, with white walls and vast wooden floors and groupings of modern furniture in pink and acid green. There are some blown-up lines of Brodsky in a frame: \"The dust settles down on objects / in summer like winter snow.\" Two Burmese cats, one grey, one black, pad across the reaches of floor, nails clicking. It's a world without mess, or distraction, or sticky fingers, the perfect context for serious thought. Not for Ignatieff the cluttered study of academe. A loft for lofty things. </p> <p>Ignatieff, 52, is wearing black corduroy trousers and a black polo neck. He is looking a little rounded, chin seeping into his jowls. He still has that angular helmet of Thunderbird hair, but there are wispier tufts coming out of his ears. Less Alan Hansen these days, more John Redwood. He has a cold coming on. When his new wife, Suzanna Zsohar, a book publicist, inquires if we'd like tea, he sinks his head into his shoulders like a little boy and puts his hands out beseechingly. \"Special tea for colds,\" he implores. </p> <p>Perhaps it's the snuffle that gives him the air of a Victorian lady as he reclines on to his yellow cushions, the colour of supermarket waxed lemons. It's certainly not the subject matter. His latest book, Virtual War, the third in a trilogy around the subject of ethnic nationalism, is subtitled: \"Kosovo and Beyond.\" He has a television series, Future War, in the offing, too. At one point in the making of this, he watched a training exercise of US marines in which they \"did that thing you see in the movies: one, two, three, round the wall. Right? Into the line of fire.\" A British marine next to him pointed out how the squad leader's M60 carbine barrel was protruding from the edge of the wall by a millimetre. \"I said, 'What difference does that make?' He said, 'The difference is you'd be dead in Belfast.'\" </p> <p>He has the language of modern warfare at the front of his mind, too. He talks about \"gun camera footage\" and \"ZTC contact video conferences\" as easily as one imagines him once talking about Proust - only he may never have talked easily about Proust. \"I was never terribly happy with the idea of the arts,\" he says now. \"I mean -\" he wriggles his shoulders and adopts a mockingly pretentious sneer \"- The ARTS, damn it.\" </p> <p>But for all this, there is about him an air of ennui, the downside perhaps of finding in most experiences \"an academic question\" or something \"philosophically interesting\". All those points to make about masculinity and the nation state and human rights when Milosevic flexes his muscles by sending a jet plane down a runway to zip past Holbrooke's ear: \"Yeah, OK, the planes are fun.\" He says he dislikes cynical scepticism in others, that if he were 18 \"instead of wasting my time with a graduate degree [Harvard], I would be out there in Africa somewhere\". But that graduate degree (not to mention the five honoraries) is hard to shrug off. Even the interview becomes a subject of his own inquisition. \"Here I get heavily ideological,\" he might say. Or: \"That's the long answer; the short answer is . . .\" Or: \"Everything I have to say about blah is clich\u00e9 . . .\" Or, when asked what he does when he's not working: \"Another ghastly pause.\" </p> <p>He says there was one occasion when he was in Kosovo, when he was on a hillside (there he was up high again) looking down on the refugee camp at Stankovec, when he \"had this fury\". \"But most of the time,\" he adds, \"I don't feel that.\" He says all this in a very slow voice, so laid back it's almost comic. He continues caressing the black Burmese with long rhythmic strokes. Ditto when he talks about the provision of care for Alzheimer patients in this country (his mother suffered from it). He feels so angry about this: \"I feel some obligation to do something about it, one of these days.\" </p> <p>Or when he almost, but not quite, gets hot under his polo neck about the Canadian reputation in this country (he has Scottish and Russian blood, has lived here for 30 years, but retains his Canadian nationality). \"There was a silly programme, it just consisted of one set of Canadian jokes after another. Jack Dee. And the joke which went on for 45 minutes was that Canadians lack a sense of humour. Firstly, it went on a bit too long even for British ears. Secondly, I thought what a provincial, stupid . . .\" He pulls himself together, audibly cools himself down. \"Brrrr.\" </p> <p>So who is Michael Ignatieff? He is part of the chattering classes, he says: \"Part of a stage army who says, 'This has got to stop' and then, in mass, it does have political effect.\" But he distances himself quite quickly from this group: \"They are rightly despised for being metropolitan and for being snobby and for being champagne this and champagne that.\" He was once an academic, but no longer; once a hack, but wouldn't call himself that now. He has voted Labour since 1970, but he's not really one of them. \"I'm not tribal Labour. I'm a Liberal at heart. Different tradition, different language.\" </p> <p>He has tried screenwriting - the first draft for Ralph Fiennes' Eugene Onegin. (\"Ralph thought I could speak Russian. I didn't disabuse him.\") But he is not a natural at it. He has also been a novelist. Asya, his first novel, a historical saga set in Russia, was not favourably received. \"That\"s a charitable understatement,\" he says, giving a hollow laugh. It's testament to his own bravery, or to something anyway, that he went on to write another. Scar Tissue, about his mother's Alzheimer's, was shortlisted for the 1993 Booker. Did you do it to show them? \"Show them ?\" he says dismissively. \"I didn't do it to show 'them'. I did it to show myself.\" </p> <p>I wondered what he thought of the trend to write about subjects once covered in fiction as autobiography. He becomes more staccato: \"I had to do it in fiction because some of the people were still alive. It is still very painful to talk about it. Scar Tissue is the only book I've ever written when I've felt completely toxic, ill. I was so upset by my mother's illness and death. I haven't got anything interesting to say about this. The thing about Alzheimer's is, 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.' I was frightened and repelled by it. I'm still repelled by it . . .\" Then he adds: \"But to the degree that Scar Tissue was based on personal experience, the experience wasn't mine. It was my brother's. He was there. I was the absent brother.\" </p> <p> He says he has nothing interesting to say about divorce either. \"Absolutely standard painful. When you initiate it, it is an experiment on live tissue and we don't know how the experiment will come out. I think my kids are OK [he has a 16-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter]. I touch all available pieces of wood.\" He used to suffer from a chronically bad back, but it's \"gone, all gone\". It's because he's happier, he says. The reason? \"She's sitting in the next room.\" </p> <p>Can you, I ask, be too clever by half? \"You absolutely can,\" he says. \"Absolutely. There are a lot of things that can't be fixed by intelligence. You can have fantastic mental discrimination and no moral judgement. You need intelligence coupled with good human radar.\" And does he have good human radar? \"No,\" he says shortly. </p> <p>At the end of the interview, we push the cats off our laps and look at some pictures on another wall across the room. The secret to his happiness comes out of a small office to join us and some light ribbing ensues. They talk about the art they are going to buy when their boat comes in. \"Which boat?\" asks Ignatieff. \"Any boat,\" says Zsohar. She then tells me that the black cat, whose name is Eric and who is a casualty from her \"previous life\", has taken to Ignatieff very firmly. \"Eric loves him. And you, I think, love him back, no? He was not sure at first, but now . . . two gentlemen together. Two portly middle-aged gentlemen in love with each other.\" </p> <p>Ignatieff beams, a man in black in a white room. Then he says, apropos of nothing, as if he's just remembered: \"I do the lottery. I won a tenner once.\" </p> <p>Virtual War, by Michael Ignatieff, is published by Chatto and Windus today, price \u00a312.99</p>",

Worried about the prolific batting of Don Bradman, England captain Douglas Jardine instructed his quick bowlers - Harold Larwood, Bill Voce and Bill Bowes - to bowl fast short-pitched bouncers at the batsmen, backed up by several close fielders on the leg side, plus some deeper fieldsmen as well. This meant that almost the only way the batsmen could score was by hooking or pulling, both chancy shots with so many fielders on the leg side and the ball zeroing in on your head. After angry protests by the Australians - and some nasty injuries - the laws were changed to restrict the number of leg-side fielders. Currently you can position only two men behind square on that side of the wicket, which means that hooks and pulls are less likely to be caught. </p> <p><strong>In a league match last season the umpire insisted on our forward short leg standing up straight rather than crouching down before he would allow the bowler to continue. Is the umpire really allowed to do this?</strong> asks Bruce Coker</p> <p>Law 41.3 says that no part of a fielder's person may extend over the pitch, and Law 42 (Unfair Play) also provides for the umpire to step in if any fielder \"incommodes the striker\", which might include, for example, a close fielder moving while in the striker's line of sight. But as far as I can see the umpire shouldn't instruct a fielder to stand upright, although he would be within his rights to tell him to keep still. If you want an official ruling you should write to the secretary of MCC (the guardians of the Laws), at Lord's Cricket Ground, London NW8.</p> <p> <strong>Has anyone played football for Scotland and cricket for England?</strong> asks Nick Dawes</p> <p>No-one has played soccer for Scotland and cricket for England, but in the 1890s Gregor MacGregor, the Middlesex wicketkeeper, played eight Tests for England and 13 rugby internationals for Scotland. </p> <p><strong>When Jonty Rhodes ran out Inzamam-ul-Haq in the 1992 World Cup, did Inzamam have a runner? </strong> asks Gavin Michel Singh</p> <p>All the accounts I can find refer to Inzamam being run out after being sent back, which suggests that he didn't have a runner. Qamar Ahmed, the Pakistan journalist, is also sure that he didn't. The Wisden Almanack reported: \"Inzamam, seeking a leg-bye, turned back to see the low-flying Rhodes crashing through the stumps.\" </p> <p> <strong>Do you have a list of the West Indies party which toured England in 1966, including the management team?</strong> asks Alan Frost</p> <p>That team, one of the best and most popular ever to visit England, was captained by the great allrounder Garry Sobers, with Conrad Hunte as his deputy. The other batsmen were Basil Butcher, Joey Carew, Rohan Kanhai, Peter Lashley, Easton McMorris, Seymour Nurse and Joe Solomon; the wicketkeepers were David Allan and Jackie Hendriks; spinners Rawle Brancker, Lance Gibbs and David Holford; fast bowlers Rudy Cohen (a late replacement for the injured Lester King), Charlie Griffith and Wes Hall. Jeffrey Stollmeyer, the former West Indies captain, was the manager, with Ben Hoyos as his assistant. The scorer/baggagemaster was JA Griffiths, and D Pye was the physiotherapist. West Indies won the Test series 3-1. England got through three captains in the series - Mike Smith and Colin Cowdrey both had a go before Brian Close took over for the final Test ... and won it. </p> <p> <strong>Who recently became the tenth bowler to reach 350 wickets in Tests?</strong> asks Peter Reid </p> <p>It was Shane Warne, who reached 350 Test wickets when he dismissed India's Hrishikesh Kanitkar at Melbourne in December. Going in to the series in New Zealand which starts on March 11 Warne is only four behind Dennis Lillee's Australian Test record of 355 wickets.</p> <p><strong>I have been handed down from a member of my family a cricket ball presented by Warwickshire to Frederick Rawlins Evans, later to become the Rev. Canon Evans. Can you tell me more about this relation of mine?</strong> asks Bean Citroen</p> <p>He was born in Griff, Warwickshire on June 1, 1842, and died in Bedworth, Warwicks on March 4, 1927. The \"Cricketers' Who's Who\" (which gives his first name as Frederic, with no \"k\"), says he was a middle-order right-hand batsman and a fast roundarm bowler. He won Blues at Oxford University from 1863 to 1865, and also played for Warwickshire and Worcestershire, neither of which were first-class cricket counties at that time. He was a nephew of the author George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans). </p> <p> <strong>Who was the first English captain to tour Australia and New Zealand, but never play in a Test match?</strong> asks Scott Barker</p> <p>This one is a bit of an old chestnut: it's Captain Cook, who skippered the first ship to reach Australia, in 1788.</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly</em> </p> <p>We regret that only a selection of questions can be answered and that personal correspondence can only sometimes be entered into</p>",

When Jonty Rhodes ran out Inzamam-ul-Haq in the 1992 World Cup, did Inzamam have a runner? asks Gavin Michel Singh All the accounts I can find refer to Inzamam being run out after being sent back, which suggests that he didn't have a runner. Qamar Ahmed, the Pakistan journalist, is also sure that he didn't. The Wisden Almanack reported: \"Inzamam, seeking a leg-bye, turned back to see the low-flying Rhodes crashing through the stumps.\" Do you have a list of the West Indies party which toured England in 1966, including the management team? asks Alan Frost That team, one of the best and most popular ever to visit England, was captained by the great allrounder Garry Sobers, with Conrad Hunte as his deputy. The other batsmen were Basil Butcher, Joey Carew, Rohan Kanhai, Peter Lashley, Easton McMorris, Seymour Nurse and Joe Solomon; the wicketkeepers were David Allan and Jackie Hendriks; spinners Rawle Brancker, Lance Gibbs and David Holford; fast bowlers Rudy Cohen (a late replacement for the injured Lester King), Charlie Griffith and Wes Hall. Jeffrey Stollmeyer, the former West Indies captain, was the manager, with Ben Hoyos as his assistant. The scorer/baggagemaster was JA Griffiths, and D Pye was the physiotherapist. West Indies won the Test series 3-1. England got through three captains in the series - Mike Smith and Colin Cowdrey both had a go before Brian Close took over for the final Test ... and won it. Who recently became the tenth bowler to reach 350 wickets in Tests? asks Peter Reid It was Shane Warne, who reached 350 Test wickets when he dismissed India's Hrishikesh Kanitkar at Melbourne in December. Going in to the series in New Zealand which starts on March 11 Warne is only four behind Dennis Lillee's Australian Test record of 355 wickets. I have been handed down from a member of my family a cricket ball presented by Warwickshire to Frederick Rawlins Evans, later to become the Rev. Canon Evans. Can you tell me more about this relation of mine? asks Bean Citroen He was born in Griff, Warwickshire on June 1, 1842, and died in Bedworth, Warwicks on March 4, 1927. The \"Cricketers' Who's Who\" (which gives his first name as Frederic, with no \"k\"), says he was a middle-order right-hand batsman and a fast roundarm bowler. He won Blues at Oxford University from 1863 to 1865, and also played for Warwickshire and Worcestershire, neither of which were first-class cricket counties at that time. He was a nephew of the author George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans). Who was the first English captain to tour Australia and New Zealand, but never play in a Test match? asks Scott Barker This one is a bit of an old chestnut: it's Captain Cook, who skippered the first ship to reach Australia, in 1788.

      "body": "<p> Why has British Telecom lost the plot? When Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, called last week for a cut in the cost of internet access, BT reacted like a wounded tiger. Sir Peter Bonfield, chief executive, issued a strongly worded statement warning him to keep off his patch and not to interfere with BT's private business. He told the chancellor that BT's timetable for opening up the local loop to competition - set for July 2001 - could not be changed without BT's permission.</p> <p> I've got news for BT. It can. It may have escaped the corporation's notice but it still has a virtual monopoly of the \"local loop\" - the last mile of wire between the telephone exchange and the domestic consumer. The government still has the right, indeed the duty, to make sure that where monopolies are operating against the public interest, they are opened up to competition. If the government threatened to refer BT's monopoly of the local loop to the monopolies commission then you would see it wake up quickly from its digital slumber. </p> <p> It has already happened in America. The dismantling of the monolithic Bell telephone system into competing \"Baby Bells\" is one of the reasons why America's cheap phone calls (flat monthly rental and then unlimited free usage) have led to a huge internet take-up rate. This has had a big knock-on effect on the rest of the economy. The more people use the internet cheaply, the more scope there is for faster expansion of e-commerce, and greater incentive for companies to create products to feed the web's booming population (and then export them). Two crucial infrastructural factors determine the future success of the internet economy.</p> <p> The first is low cost access (to drive demand and increase online usage times) and the second is broadband access to determine supply (or \"content\"). They go together. The broader the bandwidth and the cheaper the access, the quicker companies will develop innovative broadband content for the mass market and for specialist applications. </p> <p>The ability, for instance, to transmit high quality television or film instantaneously over the internet (in two directions) will not only open up a consumer market for films, less popular football matches and so forth, but could also radically change health and education. Poor schools could eavesdrop on better schools, medical operations could be done remotely and the relationship between GPs and patients - and consultants and nurses - could be revolutionised. </p> <p> BT fails on both counts. Its prices are still far too high in general and if you doubt this, look at the advertisements in the Guardian and elsewhere to see competitors undercutting BT on international calls by up to 90%. The fact that there are even worse examples of monopoly behaviour among other European telephone giants doesn't alter the argument, it merely underscores the size of the problem. Monopolies behave the same everywhere. </p> <p>The availability of broadband raises the uncomfortable question: what should be done when what is best for the shareholders clashes with what is best for the economy as a whole? If BT regards its role as maximising profits for shareholders then it will want to prolong its monopoly and milk it while it is there. Under pressure from the regulatory body, BT has agreed to open up the local loop to competitors. But it won't happen until July 1, 2001, and then will only be the interim technology ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line). </p> <p>This offers fast reception of signals but much slower outward transmission (hence the asymmetry). It will be fine for downloading films and for online shopping - but it won't be powerful enough to take film-quality video in two directions. This is where many of the most exciting applications lie (such as high-speed video conferencing). The alternative (already in use on BT's trunk routes) is fibre optics which have almost unlimited two-way transmission capacity. And why July, 2001? Someone should tell BT that its competitors are living in internet time where things happen next week, not next year. If BT really thinks it can't offer ADSL before July next year then the government should start an instant internet auction to see whether any start-ups could do it quicker.</p> <p> For 15 years BT has been trying to persuade the government to let it wire Britain with broadband capacity. The proviso was that it would need to pump \"entertainment\" down the channels (meaning video films) in order to make it commercially worthwhile. The government at first refused BT permission to send entertainment down the wires because it didn't want to upset the cable companies who were laying cables around around the country (albeit cherrypicking the most profitable regions) in order to provide competition for BT. If BT had been allowed to wire the country with fibre optics (each strand of which can carry up to four million phone calls simultaneously) on a \"common carrier\" basis then there would have been no need to dig up the roads for cable in the first place. </p> <p> When the government eventually started to think about removing the ban on providing entertainment services, BT seemed to cool on the idea of truly broadband access, unlike online nations like Finland and Singapore. Britain now has a golden opportunity to seize the initiative in the race for broadband access. And this will still be very important during the wireless revolution because even cell phone calls are routed through cabled networks. </p> <p> BT now looks like a giant that is losing its way in the internet world. It has looked on, embarrassed, while Vodafone (market capitalisation \u00a3160bn), a company that barely existed when BT (market cap, \u00a363bn) was privatised, has soared ahead of it to become one of the four most valuable companies in the world. Pundits are beginning to refer to BT as a takeover target. The Lex column of the Financial Times has even suggested it should make a takeover bid for Dixons to get its hands on its Freeserve subsidiary, in order to use Freeserve's management to exploit its own customer base. </p> <p> BT's problem is not of its own making. It arises from the Conservative government's mistake in privatising it, leaving its domestic monopoly intact. It should have been either split between its \"common carrier\" obligations and its commercial services or broken up on the Bell model. Now it is facing a fresh crisis because its perceived duty to its shareholders clashes with the national interest which demands that affordable - and that means much lower prices than BT is contemplating - broadband internet access be rolled out as quickly as is humanly possible. </p> <p> There is still time for BT to realise that a cut-price broadband policy would not only be good for the UK economy but actually good for shareholders as well. Why? Because it would convince the increasingly sceptical City that it knew the direction the internet was going. But it must act fast. It is becoming a question of wake up - or break up.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A prime minister cannot make a heavily promoted speech on Europe in Ghent without invoking Mrs Thatcher's speech at the College of Europe just down the canal in Bruges in 1988. Hers was great not in its content, a ragbag out of her handbag, but in its consequences. Bruges forged a political movement and so shaped the Tory party's fate. Ghent, 2000, does not bear comparison. </p> <p>Tony Blair delivered what is self-evidently the official message, as parroted daily by Britain in Europe: forget the euro, focus on identifying the Tory party as enemies of European Union. His twist was to exclude the Tories from any association with EU reform. He has good cards to play on making Brussels better and slimming the continent's heavyweight welfare states. Both can, not implausibly, be given a New Labourish colouring, though Mr Blair's lectures can sound insufferably Pecksniffian. So the government seeks to fix on the Tories a mask of such frightfulness that the electoral horse need glance only once before galloping off. That leaves the coast clear for Labour to put off its decision on the euro, hoping things will come right on the night. </p> <p>We happen to think there is some merit in delay, disappointing as it is to those who like their politics to resound with stern principle and those who seem to think Europe is the central issue in modern British politics. Do they include Mr Blair? In Ghent he talked of \"collective failure\": the UK's hesitation over Europe was its \"greatest miscalculation\" since 1945. He cannot mean that, for if he did he would surely be obliged to resolve the euro question by some bold stroke, out-front leadership, barnstorming across the country with or without a bus. He shows no sign of committing that political folly. The price is surely more practicality about EU membership - and fewer visions. </p> <p>British politicians become implausible when they make visionary speeches, which would sound good in French, which prizes a certain loftiness. Mr Blair is no exception. Ghent may be a necessary exercise in the vocalising of Europe for its elites but someone needs to play to domestic audiences. It is the voters and readers of xenophobic newspapers who must be addressed, persuaded, and, above all, informed. British ministers who go gallivanting in Lisbon need reminding of the ambiguities and deformations of public opinion: how (the evidence says) people become more balanced about UK participation when they engage with fact and argument, how the \"nuclear option\" of withdrawal commands only superficial support, how ambiguous are British views about the US as an alternative port in the global storm. </p> <p>The agenda of the inter-governmental conference and the Lisbon summit next month are stupefying in their complexity. Mr Blair said yesterday that Ghent was not the place for a detailed analysis. Perhaps not, but it will not do either for the problems of Poland's and Hungary's accession, reform of decision making and the democratisation of European government to go on being consigned to expert, exclusive groups. The prime minister had some tantalising things to say yesterday about how national legislatures might be better used to unpack and legitimise participation in EU - let us hear more of yesterday's somewhat opaque doctrine of subsidiarity. And \"us\" cannot just be Belgian assemblies. Bruges struck nerves in the body politic, some of them the nasty, twitching ganglia of nationalism. Mr Blair's liberal vision in Ghent is going to have no easy route into the British public's vitals.</p>",

His twist was to exclude the Tories from any association with EU reform. He has good cards to play on making Brussels better and slimming the continent's heavyweight welfare states. Both can, not implausibly, be given a New Labourish colouring, though Mr Blair's lectures can sound insufferably Pecksniffian. So the government seeks to fix on the Tories a mask of such frightfulness that the electoral horse need glance only once before galloping off. That leaves the coast clear for Labour to put off its decision on the euro, hoping things will come right on the night. We happen to think there is some merit in delay, disappointing as it is to those who like their politics to resound with stern principle and those who seem to think Europe is the central issue in modern British politics. Do they include Mr Blair? In Ghent he talked of \"collective failure\": the UK's hesitation over Europe was its \"greatest miscalculation\" since 1945. He cannot mean that, for if he did he would surely be obliged to resolve the euro question by some bold stroke, out-front leadership, barnstorming across the country with or without a bus. He shows no sign of committing that political folly. The price is surely more practicality about EU membership - and fewer visions. British politicians become implausible when they make visionary speeches, which would sound good in French, which prizes a certain loftiness. Mr Blair is no exception. Ghent may be a necessary exercise in the vocalising of Europe for its elites but someone needs to play to domestic audiences. It is the voters and readers of xenophobic newspapers who must be addressed, persuaded, and, above all, informed. British ministers who go gallivanting in Lisbon need reminding of the ambiguities and deformations of public opinion: how (the evidence says) people become more balanced about UK participation when they engage with fact and argument, how the \"nuclear option\" of withdrawal commands only superficial support, how ambiguous are British views about the US as an alternative port in the global storm. The agenda of the inter-governmental conference and the Lisbon summit next month are stupefying in their complexity. Mr Blair said yesterday that Ghent was not the place for a detailed analysis. Perhaps not, but it will not do either for the problems of Poland's and Hungary's accession, reform of decision making and the democratisation of European government to go on being consigned to expert, exclusive groups. The prime minister had some tantalising things to say yesterday about how national legislatures might be better used to unpack and legitimise participation in EU - let us hear more of yesterday's somewhat opaque doctrine of subsidiarity. And \"us\" cannot just be Belgian assemblies. Bruges struck nerves in the body politic, some of them the nasty, twitching ganglia of nationalism. Mr Blair's liberal vision in Ghent is going to have no easy route into the British public's vitals.",

It was of a piece with last week's white paper on enlargement and reform, which was a sweeping statement of pro-Europeanism. One senior official told me he had been trying to write a white paper like that for the last 15 years, only to be repelled by successive Tory foreign secretaries.

It places heavy emphasis on concepts that mean little to the British people, while being gratuitously abrasive to many other Europeans. To talk about economic reform - more liberal trade, flexible working, market-driven business rules, less social protection - may run with the grain, as described in the new issue of Prospect by Michael Maclay, Douglas Hurd's former adviser, who offers a close-textured, if optimistic, picture of the politico-economic convergence, on Anglo not Euro terms, that is quietly going on. </p> <p>Whether the Blair mission will get anywhere is another matter. At one level it's platitudinous: a call for a pan-European response to global technological change. It is intended to conclude at the Lisbon summit next month with a triumphant endorsement of the Anglo-Saxon approach. Judging by conversations I had in Paris last week, France's collaboration in such a Blairite political triumph cannot be relied on. In any case, even if the other 14 accept some version of the British way to a European economic miracle - and why on earth should they, given the superior economic performance of several of them? - how is this supposed to influence the average British voter to reconsider the anti-euro propaganda with which he has been bombarded daily for years? </p> <p>Another speech yesterday took a different line. Addressing the Britain-in-Europe council, Kenneth Clarke was startlingly off-message. BiE, under heavy Millbank influence, is supposed to keep away from the euro. That was Blair's condition for supporting it. But Mr Clarke, with his usual directness, said that, as far as he could see, BiE had no other purpose than to prepare the country for the coming referendum on the euro, and proceeded to make some vigorous arguments in favour of the currency. </p> <p>In so doing, he stayed the right side of premature commitment. Wait and see is still his position, as it is that of the majority of Brits if you look at all closely at the doomy opinion polls. But he showed how a speech could be constructed that did not surrender official hesitation, pending exchange-rate and other convergences, while still making an unashamed case for the benefits a successful euro would bring to Britain. He took the heat out of the wilder predictions, ridiculously spun by BiE staffers, about job-losses that would follow permanent exclusion. The picture he put forward was of incremental rather than seismic damage: a slow waning of investment, a gradual thinning of prosperity, an ineluctable retreat to the political and economic margins, once it became clear that the pound was going to remain at the mercy of the dollar, yen and euro, and that Britain was opting out of the forum that set the rules for the single market. </p> <p>This will be the terrain of the referendum, if and when it is held. The armies of Euro-scepticism already march across it with all guns blazing. The other side, so far, has not only run away from battle but proclaimed the virtue of doing so. Yet Mr Blair's grand assertions of Britain's sincere European-ness make no sense unless they contemplate the necessity to fight and win the existential contest. </p> <p>I now believe the internal argument about how to do this, rather than being put off until after the election, is active. Contrary to earlier indications, the present nervous silence of ministers could yet be broken. Two weeks ago there was apparently a meeting between messrs Blair, Brown, Cook and Byers to discuss the euro, which made the unanimous decision to aim for a referendum early in the next parliament after all, and to tailor political strategy accordingly. </p> <p>The critical issue is whether and when this becomes a public commitment. Gordon Brown didn't do it in New York on Tuesday, though he did scotch the rumour that the next stage of euro-changeover planning had been abandoned. The words to look for most keenly in future speeches - maybe starting with Robin Cook on Monday - are those that re-commit, other things being equal, to an early referendum, the original promise which has been waning for the last several months. </p> <p>This would spike the hopes of the other side, which thinks it has intimidated Blair to do the opposite. But it would also restore debate to a realistic plane. Once the referendum pledge is re-made, the euro will have to start being restored, Clarke-like, to the centre of discussion. That's the case people need to hear, the choice for which there is no substitute. Talk of exit is an indulgence, a fatuity, a diversion that phobes feel comfortable playing with.

      "bodyText": "The key figures in the Stephen Lawrence tragedy became household names. This is how they have fared in the promised new era of race relations. Neville Lawrence Stephen Lawrence's father serves on Jack Straw's race steering group and is part of the police's protected witness scheme. Last Christmas he was stopped by police and questioned about a robbery while driving in north-west London. The incident has led to a formal complaint and an investigation is under way. In the last year he and Doreen Lawrence have divorced. Neville has talked about the hurt of his marriage failing, and the continued pain caused by the failure to bring his son's killers to justice. He and Doreen are locked in a battle for compensation from the Met, as well as suing the five prime suspects for the murder for damages. Imran Khan Khan was the solicitor for Stephen's parents and for his work won awards cementing his reputation as one of Britain's leading radical lawyers. A partner in an east London law firm, he has also become involved in two high profile race cases of the post-Lawrence era. He is representing the widow of Jason McGowan, one of two black men found hanging in Telford, Shropshire, in circumstances his family say are suspicious. He is also representing the young Asian student who was racially attacked by a white gang alleged to involve two Leeds United footballers. Duwayne Brooks He was with Stephen when he was murdered and is recovering slowly from post traumatic stress disorder. Mr Brooks is suing the Met over the way they failed to treat him as a surviving victim of the attack that killed his friend. The force is trying to have his claim thrown out of court. Mr Brooks is facing a charge of indecent assault at the Old Bailey next month. Michael Mansfield QC The radical barrister was lead counsel for the Lawrences and his forensic cross examination of officers elicited answers that embarrassed the force. He represented the family of Ricky Reel at his inquest, where the jury sided with the family in returning an open verdict, rejecting the police's account that the Asian teenager's death was accidental. More recently he represented the family of IRA man Diarmuid O'Neill at the inquest into his killing. He is also a leading and founding member of the national civil rights movement, set up in the wake of the Macpherson report to campaign for racial justice Ros Howells The veteran community activist from south-east London served as an adviser to the Lawrence's campaign. Mrs Howells, 68, played a part in smoothing relations between Mr and Mrs Lawrence and the home secretary. Last June she was ennobled and became one of 22 new Labour working peers. Sir Paul Condon The former commissioner of the Metropolitan police clung to his job despite calls for him to quit. His term as Britain's most senior police officer ended last month, with the Lawrence inquiry findings casting a cloud over his reforms of the force. From his Kent home Condon, who jealously guards his family's privacy, is pondering his future. His replacement as commissioner was Sir John Stevens. DI Ben Bullock Second in charge of the flawed first murder investigation into Stephen's death, Bullock was the only officer to face disciplinary charges. At the hearing Mr Bullock, 50, was found guilty of mishandling two minor elements and received a caution for neglect of duty. He has now retired from the force on medical grounds after being diagnosed as suffering from stress. Deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve Turned down the job of deputy chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to head Scotland Yard's race and violent crimes task force. Asian and black community activists say that his personal style has been vital to what improvement in relations there has been in the past year. His unit secured murder convictions against the killers of Michael Menson, found burning in the street, after police initially concluded the musician had tried to commit suicide. Working relations with Sir John Stevens are not good, but it is thought that his loss would seriously undermine the Met's efforts to boost its performance and image on race. Sir William Macpherson The author of the report that shook up race relations has watched with dismay as his findings have been attacked for demoralising the Met's officers after he found the force guilty of institutional racism. From his home, Newton Castle in Scotland, he kept his counsel for most of the year. But last week he told the Guardian of his anger at personal attacks and that the Met had to buckle down and eliminate discrimination. Macpherson, a clan chief, has returned to the retirement he came out of to chair the inquiry. Bishop John Sentamu The only black member of the panel of inquiry, Sentamu is the Bishop of Stepney in east London. The issue of race and police came back to affect him last month when it was revealed that he had been stopped and questioned while driving near St Paul's cathedral. The five suspects and Clifford Norris All five suspects are believed to be at the centre of the continuing police investigation into the murder. After one television interview, they have tried to keep a low profile. But David Norris and Jamie Acourt were in court last May, and admitted stealing 32 boxes of empty soda syphons and were fined. The remaining three suspects Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson have kept out of trouble. Clifford Norris, the gangster father of David, is in jail after being sentenced to nine years in prison in 1996 for drugs and firearms offences. Customs and excise have won an appeal allowing them to seize the Norris's luxury \u00a3600,000 house in Chislehurst, Kent, after a confiscation order for \u00a3386,000 worth of proceeds from his drug deals. His brother, Alexander, has been released from his jail term.",

Robins, 33, an officer for 10 years, did not join the Metropolitan police to make money, but it has been frantic and he feels entitled to a mid-morning moan over a piece of chocolate cake. On the day of the Guardian visit he is in south London in charge of the community safety unit at Brixton police station, one of 32 set up across London 12 months ago as part of a strategy to change the way the Met tackles race and hate crime. Few people outside the force have heard of CSUs, yet they are pivotal to the way London is being policed.

Acting DS Steve Williams gave up \"kicking down doors\" to join a CSU. \"It was extremely hard. There were occasions when I could see what the problem was, but there was nothing I could do.

The high profile investigations represent, however, a small fraction of the task force's work. It has been charged with overhauling the force's conduct towards relatives of victims, an area which makes up 20% of Macpherson's report. Next month some of the Met's hardest-nosed officers will be spirited away for a week's training at Hendon to \"road test\" a new family liaison training regime. The course will be the blue-print for a Met-wide programme to be introduced this summer. Developing lay advisory involvement is another contentious area - the 35-members of the original panel suspended their work last November claiming they were being sidelined and ignored, but the show was put back on the road after a weekend's peace talks in Bournemouth. The task force has probably the most sophisticated intelligence gathering and assessment system of any unit outside M15, but it means little without work on the ground. Acting DS Paul Charlton is a young black officer working at the unit. He is Duwayne Brooks's family liaison officer and is heavily involved in CO24's effort to root out racists at football matches. On the tube going to an evening community meeting in Lewisham, south-east London, he says he thinks that the Met is moving in the right direction. Like the rest of the staff, he has faith in 'JG' - John Grieve, the deputy assistant commissioner in charge of the task force. The extent of \"the problem\" of racism outside the force is greater than inside, he says. At the town hall the 30-strong audience is made up almost entirely of police officers. Lewisham's borough commander, Mike Humphrey, describes how a football supporter was arrested for chanting racist abuse during home games at Millwall. He is filmed shouting over and again \"cut the black cunt, kill the black cunt, cut the coon\". The people around him, including children, are laughing.",

Stephen happened [his murder] and I felt that I couldn't continue like that. I was alone.\" There is an end point to her struggle. \"I need to have an end. The end would be somebody being jailed for Stephen's murder.\" Until then she cannot give up. On top of all the roles she fulfils, Mrs Lawrence is a student welfare officer and is studying for an MSc in therapeutic counselling, having earned her first degree in humanities. The values she imparted to Stephen, the importance of education, God and family, are those that in her continuing darkness provide intellectual stimulation and comfort. \"I have a great belief in God and I believe that he has kept me and carried me along. Without having that belief I don't think I could continue.\" But to lose a son, to suffer all she has suffered, that must have tested her faith? \"Oh yeah, the fact that he allowed my son to be killed and he wasn't there for him.\" A second source of strength for her, and of solace amid the maelstrom, is her children. \"They provide me with a will to live, a will to continue, a will to know that I have to keep strong for them.\" Her voice drops. \"I have to keep strong for them.\"",

As Hugh Harris, acting chairman of the commission for racial equality, put it: \"Some impressive steps have been taken, but only by a limited number of organisations. The message of the Lawrence report was that everyone needs to accept the urgency of change and take responsibility for seeing that it happens.\"</p> <p>Mr Straw acknowledged this yesterday: \"We have a long way to go. Changing policies can be done on paper but changing attitudes is much more difficult,\" he said. He said he was very conscious that the Scarman inquiry report into the inner city riots in the early 1980s had also been published \"on a fair wind\" but then progress fell away. \"I am very anxious the Lawrence inquiry report is followed through by action.\"</p> <p>But in the background there are complaints that other government policies such as on asylum are unleashing a new wave of racist rhetoric in parts of the media which may be indirectly fanning an increase in racist attacks.</p> <p>Mr Straw admitted yesterday that only the \"easy side\" of the 70 recommendations in the Macpherson report into the black teenager's murder had so far been implemented. About half the \"action plan\" has been put into effect, including race awareness training, new disciplinary powers to weed out racist officers and a clearer definition of what constitutes a racist incident. But other recommendations such as a new ministerial priority to improve the confi dence of ethnic communities in the police and more frequent official inspections of the Metropolitan police are more vague in their outcome.</p> <p>Other key areas are proving a lot more difficult to act on. Increasing the total number of black and Asian police officers at a time when overall police numbers are falling has not been achieved by a significant number of forces.</p> <p>The Telford case also raises the question whether the police outside London in mostly white areas have also learned the lessons of the Lawrence inquiry report in their approach to crime which victims or their families believe to be racist.</p> <p>It has not been a year of steady progress. When the new race relations bill was published race equality campaigners were stunned to find it only dealt with direct acts of discrimination and did not extend to outlawing indirect or institutional racism. The struggle to persuade Mr Straw to extend the bill to cover institutional racism threatened at one point to halt progress on the rest of the programme.</p> <p>The battle over the use of \"stop and search\" powers in London, which was indicative of a backlash among police officers, also undermined the pace of change.

The disappointment many race equality campaigners felt at Mr Straw's initial reluctance to legislate against institutional racism turned to delight when he announced that the race relations (amendment) bill would cover indirect discrimination and would introduce a positive duty for public bodies to promote race relations.</p> <p>This week's Guardian/ICM opinion poll also suggested there has been a fundamental change in social attitudes towards racism in the family and at work in the last five years.</p> <p>Across Whitehall there has been a visible change in culture. In the home office itself an 800-strong network of black and Asian staff working in the immigration system, the prison service, and every other section has been set up. It is being copied in other departments. Recruitment, retention and promotion targets are being set in every department in Whitehall for the employment of minority ethnic staff. Police forces are setting targets that mirror the size of their black and Asian populations while ensuring an significant ethnic presence in forces in mainly white parts of the country.</p> <p>But even if this is significant progress, it only underlines how much more needs to be done. For example, an unpublished survey of minority ethnic staff in the home office showed that one in three of them said they had faced incidents of racism, bullying or harassment at work in the past 12 months.</p> <p>While Whitehall is setting equality targets few other organisations have yet moved in the same direction. So far only about 10% of local authorities have a workforce representative of their minority ethnic communities.</p> <p>Of the outstanding issues from the Macpherson report, it appears unlikely that using racist language in a private place will become a criminal offence. Nor does there appear any rush to scrap the \"double jeopardy\" rule so that uncon victed defendants can be tried again when new evidence comes to light. Despite the fact that Mr Straw said yesterday he still wanted to see a police complaints system in which the police did not investigate themselves, this still seems a long way off. The home secretary is waiting to see how the new police disciplinary code, which comes into effect in April, works out before making any decisions.</p> <p>The police response to the Macpherson report - expressed in terms of low morale, lack of confidence and unwillingness to engage - could be seen most strikingly in the extraordinary drop in the number of stop and searches. The then Met commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, warned that the \"grieving\" for the loss of the force's reputation would result in crime rates soaring.

After all it is not as though the majority of the population does not bet on principle - only 6% may regularly venture inside a betting shop, but 70% have a regular flutter on the lottery. </p> <p>So since the company announced its \u00a3100m investment in internet betting last week, Hilton's perennially underperforming shares have been in relative overdrive, climbing from 160p - their lowest for four years - to 211p. More than \u00a3800m has been added to the value of the company. </p> <p>Today the company announced its full-year results, and profits are expected to be up from \u00a3277m to \u00a3300m-\u00a3320m. But having had a taste of e-business, investors want more - in the shape of information about how the company intends to use the web to boost business in its hotels. </p> <p>No news will not be good news. At least one analyst - Matthew Naylor at Williams de Broe - believes the shares have already risen further than justified. He points out that cyber-betting services could swiftly become oversupplied and that Hilton is trading at a premium compared with other hotel operators. </p> <p>The hotel business, meanwhile, is \"steady if unspectacular\", says Deutsche Bank. Even the Hilton chain's ebullient boss David Michels admits the British Hilton business is \"ex-growth\". </p> <p>Long term, the only thing analysts really want to hear - and the only news which will generate a change in the shares - is that Hilton is going to merge with its US namesake and so create a global business. Undoubtedly it will happen, but it could be a long and unprofitable wait. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ladbrokes.co.uk/\">Ladbrokes online</a></p>",

So since the company announced its \u00a3100m investment in internet betting last week, Hilton's perennially underperforming shares have been in relative overdrive, climbing from 160p - their lowest for four years - to 211p. More than \u00a3800m has been added to the value of the company. Today the company announced its full-year results, and profits are expected to be up from \u00a3277m to \u00a3300m-\u00a3320m. But having had a taste of e-business, investors want more - in the shape of information about how the company intends to use the web to boost business in its hotels. No news will not be good news. At least one analyst - Matthew Naylor at Williams de Broe - believes the shares have already risen further than justified. He points out that cyber-betting services could swiftly become oversupplied and that Hilton is trading at a premium compared with other hotel operators. The hotel business, meanwhile, is \"steady if unspectacular\", says Deutsche Bank. Even the Hilton chain's ebullient boss David Michels admits the British Hilton business is \"ex-growth\". Long term, the only thing analysts really want to hear - and the only news which will generate a change in the shares - is that Hilton is going to merge with its US namesake and so create a global business. Undoubtedly it will happen, but it could be a long and unprofitable wait. Ladbrokes online",

And go forward,\" he told his audience, adding that if the country wanted to cash in it should shake off its British heritage. We are too hard-wired into the old economy, apparently.</p>",

Here was a British company with a premier brand using the power of the internet to extend its franchise globally. That strategy still makes buckets of sense, but it is a long way from FT.completion. FT.com Hard sell Techno-sceptics are pretty thick on the ground just now. But while it is no surprise to find the odd one lurking within the walls of the Bank of England or creeping down the splendid art deco corridors of Unilever House, it is a surprise to see one popping out of Palo Alto, 40 miles south of San Francisco. This is not a Californian bag man, socially displaced by the local cyber-rich. He is Tom Perkins, the man who almost singlehandedly funded the whole party in the first place. Mr Perkins is one of the founders of Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, the west coat venture capital firm which backed Jim Clark's Netscape when it was just a piece of demonstrations software in Stanford university. In its 28-year existence Kleiner Perkins has achieved an internal rate of return of 37% a year on its investments. Over the past five years the annual rate has been running at 204%, and over the past three years the figures come out at a jaw-dropping 346%. But according to comments made at an America's Cup dinner in New Zealand over the weekend accompanied by Mr Clark, Mr Perkins reckons the party might be over. \"Can the stock market value of all these companies continue?\" he asked. \"I don't think it can, I think it's a bubble.\" He went on to compare the internet boom with all sorts of other proven bubbles - lasers, mini-computers, biotech, and so on. Mr Perkins's argument is that with such a large part of dot.com spending going on advertising, at the present rate the flow of venture capital will simply run out. \"I don't think there's going to be enough money in the pool for all these companies on their second and third trips to the well,\" he said. Mr Clark is not so downbeat. \"Don't be shy. And go forward,\" he told his audience, adding that if the country wanted to cash in it should shake off its British heritage. We are too hard-wired into the old economy, apparently.",

The \"toe to toe\" management revolution which Milburn allies were promoting yesterday will bring managers from different NHS disciplines to the top table at the department as part-time non-executive board members, working with more traditional Whitehall figures, to improve medical performance. The board would include Mike Richards, the \"cancer tsar\" and Peter Homa, who runs the new commission for health improvement. The move, leaked yesterday, surprised many Whitehall officials, including the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson. But Mr Milburn's strategy unit breaks further new ground, in line with the cabinet secretary's declared policy of opening up Whitehall to more outsiders. The other members of the new unit are Nick Hicks, an Oxford GP and public health consultant, Simon Stevens, an NHS manager in Britain and the US before he became Mr Milburn's special political adviser, Gavin Larner, a career civil servant at the health department, and Jo Lenaghan, health policy chief at the Institute of Public Policy Research. \"This is going with the grain of Richard Wilson's drive to modernise Whitehall by bringing in top-notch outsiders to complement the work of the civil service,\" the department source explained.",

      "body": "<p>For some reason the excellent James Boyle, who recently announced his resignation as head of Radio 4, has never received anything like the recognition he deserves for his courage in regenerating that institution's ancient, seemingly immutable schedule.</p> <p>Before he hands over to persons unknown, let's hope he receives credit for defying the forces of green ink, saving future generations from the horror of Sport on Four, the Afternoon Shift, Weekending and Breakaway. True, their replacements were not always all that one might have wished, but often there was no contest. One thinks, in particular, of the religious programmes which, until 1998 when Boyle repositioned them, subjected all Radio 4 listeners to compulsory religious instruction.</p> <p>Long after most schools had jettisoned formal morning worship, R4 was still broadcasting daily prayers, daily services and, on the sabbath, replacing the usual current affairs with a sort of grown-up version of Sunday school. All this when real-life organised worship was freely available daily in churches all over the country.</p> <p>Even now, after Boyle's removal of Anglican ceremonial to earlier slots and to long wave where they can serve the devout without oppressing Catholics (who form the larger congregation) and non-Christians, BBC radio still behaves as if it were a missionary for the established church, with its daily reminders that we are about to miss the morning service, early morning prayers and the inescapable Thought for the Day. If this occasionally maddens non-believers, it must, at least, endear the BBC to the Church of England, whose dwindling congregations, declining status and internal incoherence hardly seem to merit such public genuflections.</p> <p>On the contrary. Next Tuesday the General Synod will debate a motion from a private member, Mr Nigel Holmes, calling on the BBC to broadcast more peak time religious programmes and \"restore the hours of religious television to the average of the 1980s\".</p> <p>So ferociously do Synod members feel about the BBC's inadequacies, that Holmes's motion has attracted more signatures (226) than any other private members motion for more than 10 years. What can have hurt them so badly? Most of all, to judge by Holmes's report on the subject, it is the moving to an earlier slot of Sunday, on Radio 4, which has reduced the audience by 25%.</p> <p>Holmes compares this outrage with the eviction to long wave of Yesterday in Parliament. \"There is a close parallel between church and state,\" he avers. \"Parliamentary leaders trusted the BBC to fulfil its public service obligations, just as church leaders have for more than three-quarters of a century.\"</p> <p>Apart from the glaring objections to his comparison - the church exists to provide spiritual, rather than temporal guidance; it does not, if you discount its little gang of leglislating bishops, govern the country; it is not elected; its internal deliberations are irrelevant to non-members, and so on - Holmes's insinuation of some contractual bond betrayed, is misleading.</p> <p>The BBC is under no obligation in its charter to supply programmes that satisfy the Anglican church, any more than it has formal duties towards country dwellers, old people or cat lovers. Moreover, three quarters of a century ago, church leaders were distinctly rattled about their disciples in broadcasting. In 1936, the BBC's annual report noted that, \"No development has been more marked than the gradual disappearance of the obviously nervous suspicion with which they [church leaders] first regarded the intrusion of 'wireless religion' . . . \"</p> <p>Maybe the C of E should have stayed nervously suspicious instead of getting petulant. Certainly its subsequent conversion to the benefits of pious showbiz, and the subsequent years and years of religious broadcasting, much of it, as requested, at peak time, do not seem to have done much to preserve the number of Sunday worshippers, which last year slumped to fewer than 1m. On the other hand, I suppose, the figures might be even worse without it.</p> <p>In her thoughtful new book, The C of E, the State It's In, Monica Furlong, a practising member of the church, suggests that it must accept that things are not, as it likes to protest, going swimmingly. \"The church,\" she says plainly, \"has suffered a steep decline since the beginning of the 20th century, as well as an immense loss of status and influence. There is no need to dwell on pessimism, doom and gloom, but rather to let ourselves know what we are actually feeling, acknowledge the bewilderment of loss, face it, live through it, as those who suffer from bereavement have to do.\"</p> <p>Instead of which, the Anglican church is in denial, talking up its attendance figures, glossing over its marginalisation, self-importantly pronouncing on everything from sex education to GM foods, insisting that it must having the starring role in something as dim as the dome or as spiritually irrelevant as the BBC schedules. What sort of religion needs \"peak time\" slots in order to feel good about itself? Besides, if the church persists in its claims, it must at some point allow other religions, and supersitions equivalent broadcasting privileges. There are now more practising Roman Catholics in this country than active Anglicans: should this not be reflected on the BBC? When it comes to that, belief in aliens is now more widespread among young people, than belief in God. Maybe they should invite one on Thought for the Day.</p> <p>The best thing the Anglican church could do, if it wants to retain its role as the BBC's premier religion, is keep quiet. As all the fuss around the wretched dome ceremonies showed last year, the more it insists on its right to prominence, the more it accentuates the flimsiness of its claims, and draws attention to its rivals.</p> <p>Pressed to offer more programming, the religious affairs department has now come up with such highlights as Emma Freud on religion and sex and a series called the Soul of Britain, investigating the country's \"spiritual free market\". The programmes are probably not what the Synod is hoping for: Nigel Holmes, at least, fears that the Rev. Ernest Rea, the BBC's head of religious broadcasting, is \"disposing of the principles behind public service religious broadcasting, which have not been ashamed to recognise the importance, both past and present, of the Christian faith in this country\". But as Rea points out, the largest group of believers in Britain is labelled \"vague faith\". It is not the BBC's job to convert them.</p> <p><b> Bloody English</b><br></p> <p>A quotation from Tennyson about Irish people last week has inspired some crushing correspondence, some of it suggesting that such casual slurs would never have appeared, had they concerned another nationality. Whether or not this is true - I've always considered the Belgians a fairly safe bet - it seems only fair to even the balance. Here, then, are a few comments by non-English litterateurs, on the failings of our island race. Prosper Merim\u00e9e's comment that \"Everything that can be done with money, good sense and patience they do, but of the arts they have no more idea than my cat,\" can hardly be disputed, while Heine's broader generalisation, \"What a repulsive nation, what a disagreeable country! How strait-laced, how commonplace, how egotistical, wie eng, wie englisch,\" seems equally apt. My favourite, however, is this, from Dostoevsky's Summer Impressions, 1863: \"Everyone is drunk, but drunk joylessly, gloomily and helplessly . . .\" Plus \u00e7a change. . .</p> <p><b> Insurance scam</b><br></p> <p>The possible merger of the Norwich Union and the CGU, has yet to attract more than passing sympathy for the 5,000 people whose jobs and livelihoods are threatened. I'm sure this indifference will be shortlived. It can only be a matter of time, before public figures who have been agitating for government aid for impoverished farmers, turn their attention to the to insurance men and women of Norwich - many of whom, no doubt, come from generations of insurance men and have known no other way of life. All they need, to move hearts and minds, is some symbol of insurance as picturesque as an unwanted baby calf or worthless sheep.</p> <p><b> Shocking stuff</b><br></p> <p>The fear of comfy chairs, dismissed as absurd when it was depicted in Monty Python many years ago, has become reality. A possible EU directive, ordaining wider seats in British theatres, is now, according to a Sunday paper, alarming directors who consider physical discomfort essential to the theatre-going experience - or anyway, to keeping audiences awake. Sir Peter Hall confided that excruciating seating arrangements at the Wagnerian theatre in Bayreuth make it \"the most interesting theatre\" he has ever worked in: \"It keeps you on your toes . . . \" But could not the development of state-of-the art seats just as easily work for the directors of boring plays, as against them? Concealed wiring, for instance, would enable the director to administer mild - and less mild, according to taste - electric shocks during unendurably tedious episodes - the comic scenes in As You Like It, for example, or every other line of Racing Demon.</p>",

Long after most schools had jettisoned formal morning worship, R4 was still broadcasting daily prayers, daily services and, on the sabbath, replacing the usual current affairs with a sort of grown-up version of Sunday school. All this when real-life organised worship was freely available daily in churches all over the country. Even now, after Boyle's removal of Anglican ceremonial to earlier slots and to long wave where they can serve the devout without oppressing Catholics (who form the larger congregation) and non-Christians, BBC radio still behaves as if it were a missionary for the established church, with its daily reminders that we are about to miss the morning service, early morning prayers and the inescapable Thought for the Day. If this occasionally maddens non-believers, it must, at least, endear the BBC to the Church of England, whose dwindling congregations, declining status and internal incoherence hardly seem to merit such public genuflections. On the contrary. Next Tuesday the General Synod will debate a motion from a private member, Mr Nigel Holmes, calling on the BBC to broadcast more peak time religious programmes and \"restore the hours of religious television to the average of the 1980s\". So ferociously do Synod members feel about the BBC's inadequacies, that Holmes's motion has attracted more signatures (226) than any other private members motion for more than 10 years. What can have hurt them so badly? Most of all, to judge by Holmes's report on the subject, it is the moving to an earlier slot of Sunday, on Radio 4, which has reduced the audience by 25%. Holmes compares this outrage with the eviction to long wave of Yesterday in Parliament. \"There is a close parallel between church and state,\" he avers. \"Parliamentary leaders trusted the BBC to fulfil its public service obligations, just as church leaders have for more than three-quarters of a century.\" Apart from the glaring objections to his comparison - the church exists to provide spiritual, rather than temporal guidance; it does not, if you discount its little gang of leglislating bishops, govern the country; it is not elected; its internal deliberations are irrelevant to non-members, and so on - Holmes's insinuation of some contractual bond betrayed, is misleading. The BBC is under no obligation in its charter to supply programmes that satisfy the Anglican church, any more than it has formal duties towards country dwellers, old people or cat lovers. Moreover, three quarters of a century ago, church leaders were distinctly rattled about their disciples in broadcasting. In 1936, the BBC's annual report noted that, \"No development has been more marked than the gradual disappearance of the obviously nervous suspicion with which they [church leaders] first regarded the intrusion of 'wireless religion' . . . \" Maybe the C of E should have stayed nervously suspicious instead of getting petulant. Certainly its subsequent conversion to the benefits of pious showbiz, and the subsequent years and years of religious broadcasting, much of it, as requested, at peak time, do not seem to have done much to preserve the number of Sunday worshippers, which last year slumped to fewer than 1m. On the other hand, I suppose, the figures might be even worse without it. In her thoughtful new book, The C of E, the State It's In, Monica Furlong, a practising member of the church, suggests that it must accept that things are not, as it likes to protest, going swimmingly. \"The church,\" she says plainly, \"has suffered a steep decline since the beginning of the 20th century, as well as an immense loss of status and influence. There is no need to dwell on pessimism, doom and gloom, but rather to let ourselves know what we are actually feeling, acknowledge the bewilderment of loss, face it, live through it, as those who suffer from bereavement have to do.\" Instead of which, the Anglican church is in denial, talking up its attendance figures, glossing over its marginalisation, self-importantly pronouncing on everything from sex education to GM foods, insisting that it must having the starring role in something as dim as the dome or as spiritually irrelevant as the BBC schedules. What sort of religion needs \"peak time\" slots in order to feel good about itself? Besides, if the church persists in its claims, it must at some point allow other religions, and supersitions equivalent broadcasting privileges. There are now more practising Roman Catholics in this country than active Anglicans: should this not be reflected on the BBC? When it comes to that, belief in aliens is now more widespread among young people, than belief in God. Maybe they should invite one on Thought for the Day. The best thing the Anglican church could do, if it wants to retain its role as the BBC's premier religion, is keep quiet. As all the fuss around the wretched dome ceremonies showed last year, the more it insists on its right to prominence, the more it accentuates the flimsiness of its claims, and draws attention to its rivals. Pressed to offer more programming, the religious affairs department has now come up with such highlights as Emma Freud on religion and sex and a series called the Soul of Britain, investigating the country's \"spiritual free market\". The programmes are probably not what the Synod is hoping for: Nigel Holmes, at least, fears that the Rev. Ernest Rea, the BBC's head of religious broadcasting, is \"disposing of the principles behind public service religious broadcasting, which have not been ashamed to recognise the importance, both past and present, of the Christian faith in this country\". But as Rea points out, the largest group of believers in Britain is labelled \"vague faith\". It is not the BBC's job to convert them. Bloody English A quotation from Tennyson about Irish people last week has inspired some crushing correspondence, some of it suggesting that such casual slurs would never have appeared, had they concerned another nationality. Whether or not this is true - I've always considered the Belgians a fairly safe bet - it seems only fair to even the balance. Here, then, are a few comments by non-English litterateurs, on the failings of our island race. Prosper Merim\u00e9e's comment that \"Everything that can be done with money, good sense and patience they do, but of the arts they have no more idea than my cat,\" can hardly be disputed, while Heine's broader generalisation, \"What a repulsive nation, what a disagreeable country! How strait-laced, how commonplace, how egotistical, wie eng, wie englisch,\" seems equally apt. My favourite, however, is this, from Dostoevsky's Summer Impressions, 1863: \"Everyone is drunk, but drunk joylessly, gloomily and helplessly . . .\" Plus \u00e7a change. . . Insurance scam The possible merger of the Norwich Union and the CGU, has yet to attract more than passing sympathy for the 5,000 people whose jobs and livelihoods are threatened. I'm sure this indifference will be shortlived. It can only be a matter of time, before public figures who have been agitating for government aid for impoverished farmers, turn their attention to the to insurance men and women of Norwich - many of whom, no doubt, come from generations of insurance men and have known no other way of life. All they need, to move hearts and minds, is some symbol of insurance as picturesque as an unwanted baby calf or worthless sheep. Shocking stuff The fear of comfy chairs, dismissed as absurd when it was depicted in Monty Python many years ago, has become reality. A possible EU directive, ordaining wider seats in British theatres, is now, according to a Sunday paper, alarming directors who consider physical discomfort essential to the theatre-going experience - or anyway, to keeping audiences awake. Sir Peter Hall confided that excruciating seating arrangements at the Wagnerian theatre in Bayreuth make it \"the most interesting theatre\" he has ever worked in: \"It keeps you on your toes . . . \" But could not the development of state-of-the art seats just as easily work for the directors of boring plays, as against them? Concealed wiring, for instance, would enable the director to administer mild - and less mild, according to taste - electric shocks during unendurably tedious episodes - the comic scenes in As You Like It, for example, or every other line of Racing Demon.",

In Guardian Society (February 9), I reported on a neighbourhood project on an estate which, in a 10 year period, saw only one child go into care. Its essential features were that its staff lived in the area and stayed long-term. The treasury is drawing up plans for a new children's fund for voluntary projects. It should give priority to those which are locally controlled and which are rooted with local families. Prevention would be promoted. Bob Holman Glasgow bob@holman24.fsnet.co.uk Ten years ago Tayside social work department closed down the independent children's home I had run for 15 years because all future emphasis was to be on fostering and adoption rather than residential care. Scores of children benefited from placement with us over those years, some moved on to successful \"family\" placements, some to disastrous ones, and others stayed with us long-term. When we were closed down 13 children (all in their teens) had to be found alternative placements. One older teenager suffered from the breakdown of subsequent placements and eventually committed suicide. I do hope Tony Blair's radical review of adoption procedures will pay adequate attention to such vital considerations. There is, 10 years on and despite the crop of children's homes \"abuse scandals\", a call from many quarters to reopen residential homes for young people. Les Potter Bristol lespam@mcmail.com",

      "body": "<p>The publication of a highly provocative report by the European parliament has brought to a head concerns about a worldwide eavesdropping network dominated by the US and Britain.</p> <p>The report - by the parliament's justice committee - says that the network, code-named Echelon, infringes rights to privacy. It coincides with a number of European investigations charging the US with industrial espionage and increasing French distrust of the close intelligence cooperation between \"Anglo-Saxon\" nations.</p> <p>The parliamentary report claims that the Echelon network is capable of listening in on \"billions of messages per hour\" - including telephone calls, fax transmissions and private emails - and intercepts sensitive Europe-wide commercial communications.</p> <p>The existence of the Echelon network was confirmed recently by an official US government document published on the internet. Yesterday Duncan Campbell, the British freelance journalist who helped compile the report, told the committee it was run by the US National Security Agency (NSA) with Canada, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. The British element is based at the GCHQ station in Morwenstow, north Cornwall.</p> <p>Charles Pasqua, the former French interior minister and a member of the committee, said British participation gave its an unfair advantage over its EU partners. \"The rules of the game are rigged and they are rigged especially by the British. This is shocking,\" he said.</p> <p>The report describes a number of cases in which US companies allegedly won contracts destined for European firms after NSA intercepted conver sations.

      "bodyText": "The publication of a highly provocative report by the European parliament has brought to a head concerns about a worldwide eavesdropping network dominated by the US and Britain. The report - by the parliament's justice committee - says that the network, code-named Echelon, infringes rights to privacy. It coincides with a number of European investigations charging the US with industrial espionage and increasing French distrust of the close intelligence cooperation between \"Anglo-Saxon\" nations. The parliamentary report claims that the Echelon network is capable of listening in on \"billions of messages per hour\" - including telephone calls, fax transmissions and private emails - and intercepts sensitive Europe-wide commercial communications. The existence of the Echelon network was confirmed recently by an official US government document published on the internet. Yesterday Duncan Campbell, the British freelance journalist who helped compile the report, told the committee it was run by the US National Security Agency (NSA) with Canada, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. The British element is based at the GCHQ station in Morwenstow, north Cornwall. Charles Pasqua, the former French interior minister and a member of the committee, said British participation gave its an unfair advantage over its EU partners. \"The rules of the game are rigged and they are rigged especially by the British. This is shocking,\" he said. The report describes a number of cases in which US companies allegedly won contracts destined for European firms after NSA intercepted conver sations. The Airbus consortium and Thomson CSF of France were among the reported losers. A former NSA agent, Wayne Madsen, told Australian television last year that the US used information gathered from its base in Australia to win a half-share of a significant Indonesian trade contract for AT&amp;T which intercepts showed was initially going to NRC of Japan. Meanwhile, in a 100-page report submitted recently to the French defence ministry's strategic intelligence arm, DAS, software giant Microsoft is accused of colluding with the US intelligence services to spy on foreign businesses, amid suspicions that the company planted \"back door\" spy holes in its MS-DOS operating system and Windows software. According to yesterday's Le Figaro, the spying devices would enable the NSA to penetrate a company's networks and read top-secret documents. Microsoft said it had never, in France or any other country, installed a system allowing the NSA or other US government agencies to decode encrypted data coming from a computer equipped with Windows. Lawsuits against Britain and the US for their role in Echelon have been lodged in France, and parliamentary inquiries are under way in Italy and Germany. In the US, a congressional investigation into Echelon's implications for privacy rights begins later this year. Last night, the foreign office said British intelligence services worked \"entirely within the law\". This allowed interception in the interests of Britain's \"economic well-being\" as well as to protect national security. A spokeswoman added: \"We do not engage in bulk surveillance, whatever Duncan Campbell says.\"",

He presented a paper at the Academy for the Advancement of Science conference in Washington DC, documenting how the decline in marriage rates in the US led directly to a fall in spousal homicide. While in 1996 (the most recent year for which figures are available) 75% of domestic murder victims in the US were women, overall the rate of murder in American marriages has plummeted 36% since 1976. (By comparison, 50% of domestic murder victims in England and Wales were women, according to the Home Office.)</p> <p>If you did nothing but listen to the broadcast media in America this week, you would think defending the sanctity of marriage was the nation's top priority. But if you noted Rosenfeld's findings, the truth revealed itself to be something quite different. The fact is, Americans are not the great champions of marriage they pretend to be. Marriage rates have never fallen so low, nor is cohabitation filling the void. Americans are choosing to stay single longer and women in particular don't see marriage as an economic or social necessity.</p> <p>\"The marriage rate in America was 8.3 per 1,000 people in 1998, the lowest since 1958,\" Rosenfeld says. \"Fewer marriages means fewer opportunities for spousal violence.\"</p> <p>But the statistics do not mean domestic abuse is no longer a fixture in the American home. While there is a downturn due to fewer marriages and more domestic violence services, it is still an issue with which many married women have to contend. \"It's the proximity of the relationship and the influence of alcohol, handguns [50% of domestic murders here involve a gun] and financial problems that causes homicide.\"</p> <p>Rosenfeld is right, but he is only telling half the story. The other reason marriage rates are falling, why men are killing their wives, is the changing role of women both inside and outside the home. Forty years of feminism have thrown American men into a blind panic. The boundaries that once defined an American marriage are not so much blurred as erased. Women now work and earn their own money. They are not sexual na\u00effs on their wedding day. Inside their marriages, they have redefined the word \"wife\" to mean equal partner, not unpaid housekeeper.</p> <p>Men locked into the idea that marriage means they play the breadwinner and man of the house are in shock. They complain that marriage to the new American woman - educated, financially independent, sexually liberated - emasculates them. As Susan Faludi so aptly titled her new book on the plight of the American male, they feel \"stiffed\".</p> <p>Subsequently, the switch in marriage roles sends them over the edge. As Butterworth says, a lot of domestic abuse is really anger at women leading independent lives within a marriage. \"With the rise of the women's movement, roles changed dramatically. Married men don't 'own' their wives any more. A lot of men would just love to wish away the women's movement but they can't. I think it's fascinating that so many American men today are marrying foreign brides who are much more passive in relationships.\"</p> <p>While some men still seek out women willing to play the traditional wife, others are avoiding marriage. Statistics show children of divorce are less likely to marry and divorced adults are more likely to live together than remarry. For women, there is no fear that without a husband they will become social pariahs, so they opt for what they see as the better bet: permanent singleton status or cohabitation.</p> <p>\"There is a huge psychological difference for Americans between marriage and living together,\" Butterworth says. \"If you are not married, you can change the arrangement any time. If you are a victim of domestic violence, you can walk out. Living together gives women freedom because it allows them to sidestep the stereotypes. A lot of religious denominations say, for instance, that the husband is ruler in the house. Without marriage, there is no battle. Women get to redefine the boundaries.\"</p> <p>So where do all these shifting goalposts leave the once celebrated American marriage? Has feminism killed it? Is it now a television stunt and not a sacred vow? Well, yes and no. Americans will still marry, but the marriage of 50s TV sitcoms, with Mom in the kitchen and Dad at the ad agency, is dead and buried. The more women own their lives, the less they look for men to create a role and lifestyle for them. And, as Butterworth notes, men threatened by the new face of American marriage are heading overseas to find a partner willing to recreate the 50s inside the home.</p> <p>\"The future of American marriage is going to be very interesting,\" he concludes. \"I believe it will continue to decline. And I also believe whoever chooses to get married now understands the roles are interchangeable and nobody will be embedded in stereotypes any more.\" Millionaires who think money, not equality, will buy them love need not apply.</p>",

They were obviously thinking about couples spending long periods of time in space together,\" he reveals in a book on the Mir space station, The Final Mission. </p> <p>Whatever happened to a bit of character-building abstinence? Isn't it possible for these couples to keep their minds off their crotches just this once, for the greater good? </p> <p>Celibacy wasn't a problem for Laura Supra, part of Nasa's longest-duration test team on earth, who says: \"That's one of the things you give up by going up there.\" And Musa Manarov, who spent a year on Mir, agrees: \"A young guy could go for three years without women.\" </p> <p>That's the spirit. Why not send them up together? It would save Nasa the cost of the \"inflatable tunnels and wall-mounted straps\" they found were necessary to keep couples from floating to opposite ends of the spaceship. </p> <p>They did come up with four unspecified positions that could be achieved while drifting untethered, which potentially sounds like fun until you consider what happens when the participants uncouple. Where does what a friend delicately describes as \"the goo\" go? By the same token, those who get their kicks from peeing on other people might find weightlessness gives them a taste of their own medicine and S&amp;M fans will be denied that satisfying crack of whip on flesh, which means space-coitus will pretty much be restricted to the basics. </p> <p>Then there's the nuisance of retrieving bits of your spacesuit from where you've strewn them as you wafted around. No, you'd be smart to opt for the wall straps. In fact, the only advantages of celestial schtupping - and this will be put to the test this century, on a three-year mission to Mars - have nothing to do with the act itself. No tiffs about who sleeps on the wet patch, for example, because it'll be all over the place (see above reference to goo). </p> <p> Whether he'll respect you in the morning is immaterial in the eternal black night of deep space. Morning never comes and neither does the inevitable agonising about who should phone who. Finally, there would be no need, as depicted in countless sci-fi films, to stop at another planet en route to pick up a love interest, and no worries about the alien offspring that might result from such a union. </p> <p>It's interesting that Nasa should find it necessary to carry out the experiment, since space travel has hitherto revelled in its very sexlessness. It's a heroic, ennobling pursuit and those who do it, invariably men until relatively recently, seem to be liberated from fleshly imperatives. Given the Tipper Gore-esque wives waiting for them back in Houston, maybe it's the only chance they get to experience the pleasure of platonic companionship and the bonds formed of being braver and smarter than the rest of us. </p> <p>Certainly there was never anything less than professional in the relationship between Star Trek's Lieutenant Uhura and the men on the Enterprise. And in Lost In Space (the 60s TV version), the harassed mother and father gave the impression sex was the last thing on their minds. </p> <p>But for some, such as cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaia, there will be an illicit thrill to the whole idea. She's rumoured to have bedded, if that's the word, one of her male colleagues on the Salut-7 space station back in 1982. Perhaps it was just a way of venting pent-up energy, but I'll wager the idea of doing it in a spaceship, with others nearby, had a lot to do with it. A similar sense of adolescent naughtiness probably attended the coupling of two strangers on an American Airlines flight from Dallas to Manchester recently. Sometimes it's more tantalising to defer gratification, even - especially? - on a trip to Mars.</p>",

They did come up with four unspecified positions that could be achieved while drifting untethered, which potentially sounds like fun until you consider what happens when the participants uncouple. Where does what a friend delicately describes as \"the goo\" go? By the same token, those who get their kicks from peeing on other people might find weightlessness gives them a taste of their own medicine and S&amp;M fans will be denied that satisfying crack of whip on flesh, which means space-coitus will pretty much be restricted to the basics. Then there's the nuisance of retrieving bits of your spacesuit from where you've strewn them as you wafted around. No, you'd be smart to opt for the wall straps. In fact, the only advantages of celestial schtupping - and this will be put to the test this century, on a three-year mission to Mars - have nothing to do with the act itself. No tiffs about who sleeps on the wet patch, for example, because it'll be all over the place (see above reference to goo). Whether he'll respect you in the morning is immaterial in the eternal black night of deep space. Morning never comes and neither does the inevitable agonising about who should phone who. Finally, there would be no need, as depicted in countless sci-fi films, to stop at another planet en route to pick up a love interest, and no worries about the alien offspring that might result from such a union. It's interesting that Nasa should find it necessary to carry out the experiment, since space travel has hitherto revelled in its very sexlessness. It's a heroic, ennobling pursuit and those who do it, invariably men until relatively recently, seem to be liberated from fleshly imperatives. Given the Tipper Gore-esque wives waiting for them back in Houston, maybe it's the only chance they get to experience the pleasure of platonic companionship and the bonds formed of being braver and smarter than the rest of us. Certainly there was never anything less than professional in the relationship between Star Trek's Lieutenant Uhura and the men on the Enterprise. And in Lost In Space (the 60s TV version), the harassed mother and father gave the impression sex was the last thing on their minds. But for some, such as cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaia, there will be an illicit thrill to the whole idea. She's rumoured to have bedded, if that's the word, one of her male colleagues on the Salut-7 space station back in 1982. Perhaps it was just a way of venting pent-up energy, but I'll wager the idea of doing it in a spaceship, with others nearby, had a lot to do with it. A similar sense of adolescent naughtiness probably attended the coupling of two strangers on an American Airlines flight from Dallas to Manchester recently. Sometimes it's more tantalising to defer gratification, even - especially? - on a trip to Mars.",

And why not? For, as an exuberant Mr McCain said later that evening at his victory rally: \"What a difference a couple of days make.\"</p> <p>What a difference indeed. Over the past few days, the rollercoaster primary struggle has revealed the two sides of the John McCain phenomenon more sharply than ever. There is the man who is splitting his Republican party down the middle in his contest with George W Bush. And there is also the man who promises to unify a new \"McCain majority\" of Republicans, independents and Democrats. Then there are the two sides of the man himself. Impetuous McCain in defeat in South Carolina on Saturday, yet magnanimous McCain in victory in Arizona on Tuesday.</p> <p>On Saturday night in South Carolina the McCain camp were drinking cold revenge not cold beer. Mr McCain was visibly angry in defeat. George W Bush's juggernaut had thumped him 53% to 42%. The Arizona senator had thrown away an opinion poll lead. There was nothing graceful about his concession speech in Charleston.</p> <p>\"I will not take the low road to the highest office in the land,\" Mr McCain said bitterly. \"I want the presidency in the best way, not the worst way.\"</p> <p>Mr McCain came out swinging in Michigan on Sunday and Monday. Campaigning with a new aggression, the Arizona senator knew that Michigan was a win-or-bust effort. His language reflected his gung-ho urgency. It struck some observers as intemperate.</p> <p>\"You saw Star Wars, right?\" Mr McCain told an audience in Saginaw late on the eve of polling in Michigan, using an image he has frequently invoked in the past few weeks. \"I'm like Luke Skywalker trying to get out of the Death Star. They're shooting at me from everywhere.\"</p> <p><b> Turning point</b></p> <p>This time, he went further. \"Everybody's against me. Governor Engler [the Michigan Republican governor], Governor Bush, all the governors, all the senators. But we're going to kill 'em. We're going to win this election.\"</p> <p>Less than 24 hours later, back home by now, a new Mr McCain took the stage in Phoenix to mark his double triumph in Arizona and Michigan. In Arizona, Mr McCain won comfortably by 60% to Mr Bush's 36%. In Michigan, the biggest state to vote in the primary calendar so far and the one that Governor Engler had promised would be \"asbestos\" for Mr Bush against a McCain brush-fire, Mr McCain hit back with a 50% to 44% win.</p> <p>It was a turning point in the campaign for two reasons. First because, from today, the Republican primary battleground shifts from \"open\" to \"closed\" primaries. It shifts from states like New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan, in which independents and Democrats can flood the Republican process, to states like California, New York and Connecticut - all of which vote on March 7 - where only Republicans can vote. Until now, the open primaries have been the McCain campaign's life-support system - Michigan, where only a minority of the voters in the primary were Republicans, was the most spectacular example. Now the battle is for Republican voters alone, terrain on which Mr Bush, the Texas governor, is far stronger than his challenger.</p> <p>The second turning point, though, is that Michigan and Arizona made Mr McCain even more credible than he had been after New Hampshire. Tuesday proved that Mr McCain is not a one-state wonder. It proved that defeat in South Carolina was not a knock-out blow. Tuesday could have ended the McCain insurgency. Instead, it not only kept it alive but also made it a genuine threat to Mr Bush.</p> <p>It gets tougher now for Mr McCain. He has fresh impetus from Michigan and Arizona - and he could win again in Washington state next week - but he must adapt to the new politics of the Super Tuesday campaign on March 7 or perish.</p> <p>That imperative was reflected in his victory speech in Phoenix. Mr McCain had spent much of the day drafting the brief but crucial address with his strategist, Mike Murphy, and his campaign manager, Rick Davis, and the words he used were highly significant. They reflected the McCain campaign's now desperate need to break Mr Bush's continuing grip on the core Republican voters who hold the result of the contest in their hands.</p> <p><b> Teddy's boy</b></p> <p>\"I want to make a special plea tonight to my fellow Republicans,\" Mr McCain began. \"Don't fear this campaign, my fellow Republicans. Join it. Join it.\"</p> <p>In many recent speeches, Mr McCain has often identified himself with Theodore Roosevelt, the swashbuckling military adventurer who took on the \"robber barons\" of America's first industrial revolution. This time he added the name of Ronald Reagan. \"I am a proud Reagan conservative,\" he said. \"I love the Republican party.\"</p> <p>The question, though, is whether the Republican party loves John McCain. The reality is that about a quarter of them do, but most of them don't. A lot of them, the religious right in particular, genuinely hate him. Mr Bush reached out to religious conservatives to save him after New Hampshire. They delivered for him in South Carolina, but their tactics backfired in Michigan, especially among the Catholic voters who are so important in the crucial midwestern states like Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and Ohio where a presidential election is often lost and won.</p> <p>\"We are creating a new majority, my friends,\" Mr McCain concluded on Tuesday night, \"a McCain majority.\" The next three weeks will show whether that claim is, as the senator says, Al Gore's nightmare, or if it is simply John McCain's pipe dream.</p> <p><b>The next round...</b></p> <p>The attention of the Republican presidential contenders now focuses on the next round of contests.</p> <p>This weekend, barely noticed by the media and unvisited by the candidates, there are Republican caucuses in some of the more distant corners of the United States empire.

One is in Washington state, where John McCain hopes to win in a state with 37 convention delegates. Meanwhile, George W Bush is hopeful of winning in Virginia, with 56 delegates.

In the wake of his twin wins in Michigan and Arizona, Republicans across the nation may take a new look at their party's strategy.

The research also looked at the reasons why older people might not take up learning. A quarter of the respondents said they had done enough learning in their life; 22% felt too old. Family responsibilities were a factor, with non-learners likely to be spending free time with grandchildren.",

It must be a tool for inclusion, not a weapon for exclusion.\" Dr Carey also spoke warmly of recent contacts the church had had with government ministers concerning moves to repeal clause 28. Senior Anglicans have had private meetings with ministers to secure a modified statutory framework ensuring the promotion of family values if the clause, forbidding the \"promotion\" of homosexuality, is to be repealed. Signalling a tacit acceptance that the clause will be repealed, church leaders including Dr Carey and the Roman Catholic archbishop-elect of Westminster, Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, have called for children to be given a moral framework based on the family, enshrined in law. Dr Carey said: \"Strong support should be given to promoting marriage as the fundamental building block of family life. \"I am pleased that ministers have been prepared to listen carefully to our views and priorities in considering a statutory framework for future guidance to schools.\"",

      "bodyText": "Three Scottish local authorities are the focus of inquiries into allegations that scores of council staff have been falsely claiming hundreds of thousands of pounds in benefits. Up to 80 staff and former staff of Glasgow city council face prosecution over alleged fraudulent claims worth more than \u00a3500,000. A separate investigation at East Dunbartonshire council has uncovered 50 cases of irregular benefit claims worth around \u00a390,000, and inquiries are under way at North Lanarkshire council into alleged fraud. The investigations are part of joint effort by the benefits agency and the local authorities to crack down on housing and council tax benefits fraud by council workers. In Glasgow 18 employees are facing internal disciplinary action, although no one has yet been suspended, a council spokeswoman said yesterday. The benefits agency, which can refer cases straight to the procurator fiscal recommending criminal prosecutions, said even more cases could come to light. A spokeswoman said. \"We have still got more records to check. All the cases will be considered for prosecution; it depends on individual circumstances.\" Glasgow council, the biggest in Scotland, said 80 full- and part-time staff may have been involved in fraudulent claims over the past seven years. The investigation involved checking the council's payroll records against its own and the benefits agency's payment information. Most alleged fraud claims were for income support, incapacity benefit or job seeker's allowance, said a spokesman. Many were for full housing benefit or council tax benefit. Jimmy Andrews, the council's chief executive, said: \"We are one of the biggest employers in Scotland, with over 36,000 staff, and unfortunately it is a fact of life that a small number of employees are wrongly claiming money from the state or the council.

You don't want to upset them.\" He passed over case details and a list of informants. He said the family had wanted the list \"because it was useful to plug any gaps in leaked intelligence\".</p> <p>Asked by his counsel, Andrew Trollope QC, why he did it, Herbert said: \"Because of the fear I was in. They knew where my fianc\u00e9e lived. They would take drastic measures against us if I refused them.</p> <p>\"If I was not an asset, I would be a liability.\"</p> <p>The prosecution alleges Herbert abused his position out of arrogance and greed. At the time, 1998, he was working on a legal team dealing with investigations into the London-based Adams family, Victor Temple QC, prosecuting, had told the court. Herbert yesterday agreed that by handing over the material he was in breach of the law and had created unknown risks to others.</p> <p>He told the court a \"Gypsy looking\" man approached him and talked to him about his fianc\u00e9e, Sian Williams, and where she lived in Swansea. When he asked whether the man was a friend of hers, he was told they had a mutual friend - Terry Adams.</p> <p>Herbert, from Twickenham in west London, and Kevin Sumer, 41, a nightclub door manager from Brentford in Middlesex, deny a joint charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Herbert alone denies corruption - a \u00a3500 bribe. He also denies two charges of disclosing information without lawful authority, for which Sumer is accused of aiding and abetting.</p> <p>The prosecution has alleged the Adams and their associates formed a feared organisation \"steeped in the highest levels of criminal activity\".</p> <p>Herbert, while working at the prosecution's headquarters in central London, copied computer files and passed them to Sumer, who gave them to Billy Isaacs, a man allegedly connected to the family.</p> <p>Herbert was allegedly in debt and moonlighted as a nightclub bouncer in addition to his \u00a314,000-a-year post. He was taken on by Sumer, the court had heard, who learned where he worked. Herbert got payments of \u00a3500 cash as well as his doorman's wages.</p> <p>He told the court: \"I had to keep the money, for fear of upsetting Sumer.\"</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",

Mark Herbert, 31, a policeman's son who played rugby for London Welsh, said he was warned by the Adams family \"do not mess about\". At the Old Bailey he said he was also told: \"They want to be your friends... You don't want to upset them.\" He passed over case details and a list of informants. He said the family had wanted the list \"because it was useful to plug any gaps in leaked intelligence\". Asked by his counsel, Andrew Trollope QC, why he did it, Herbert said: \"Because of the fear I was in. They knew where my fianc\u00e9e lived. They would take drastic measures against us if I refused them. \"If I was not an asset, I would be a liability.\" The prosecution alleges Herbert abused his position out of arrogance and greed. At the time, 1998, he was working on a legal team dealing with investigations into the London-based Adams family, Victor Temple QC, prosecuting, had told the court. Herbert yesterday agreed that by handing over the material he was in breach of the law and had created unknown risks to others. He told the court a \"Gypsy looking\" man approached him and talked to him about his fianc\u00e9e, Sian Williams, and where she lived in Swansea. When he asked whether the man was a friend of hers, he was told they had a mutual friend - Terry Adams. Herbert, from Twickenham in west London, and Kevin Sumer, 41, a nightclub door manager from Brentford in Middlesex, deny a joint charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Herbert alone denies corruption - a \u00a3500 bribe. He also denies two charges of disclosing information without lawful authority, for which Sumer is accused of aiding and abetting. The prosecution has alleged the Adams and their associates formed a feared organisation \"steeped in the highest levels of criminal activity\". Herbert, while working at the prosecution's headquarters in central London, copied computer files and passed them to Sumer, who gave them to Billy Isaacs, a man allegedly connected to the family. Herbert was allegedly in debt and moonlighted as a nightclub bouncer in addition to his \u00a314,000-a-year post. He was taken on by Sumer, the court had heard, who learned where he worked. Herbert got payments of \u00a3500 cash as well as his doorman's wages. He told the court: \"I had to keep the money, for fear of upsetting Sumer.\" The case continues.",

      "bodyText": "Social workers have reacted furiously to claims by doctors that they are leaving children to be repeatedly abused in order to produce sufficient evidence that they should be taken into care. The claims are made today in an attack on the children act by two leading paediatricians who say that the legislation, and its interpretation by social workers, have set back the battle against child abuse. In an article in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, published by the British Medical Association, the paediatricians Nigel Speight and Jane Wynne say: \"Most paediatricians we have approached who have a special commitment to child protection work admit feelings of near despair about the state of child protection in this country.\" Social work leaders have described the criticism as \"outrageous\" and the doctors' analysis as \"deeply flawed\". The department of health said the act was working well overall. The children act became law in 1989, and took effect in 1990, as part of an overhaul of the child protection system following the Cleveland child abuse controversy. Dr Wynne, of Leeds general infirmary, was caught up in the controversy as a co-inventor of the anal dilation test that was used by Cleveland doctors to diagnose sexual abuse and trigger the removal of children from their families. Dr Wynne and Dr Speight, of Dryburn hospital in Durham, point out that the number of children taken into care dropped by a third, from 60,000 to 40,000, between 1991 and 1995. The doctors say it is unlikely that abused and neglected children were being taken into care unnecessarily before 1991, or that there was an improvement in preventive and therapeutic work that produced such a dramatic effect over the following four years. The reality, they say, is that the act has shifted the emphasis of child protection towards keeping the family unit together. The swift intervention possible before 1990 has been replaced by \"a leisurely assessment process with the child still in the abusive home\". Because the act requires a higher standard of proof of abuse, moreover, \"social workers feel they have to let the child be re-abused to show the judge ... that they are only having recourse to legal proceedings as a last resort.\" The doctors admit that their argument is deliberately unbalanced as a way of stimulating debate. In one case study, they described how a three-year-old girl was left for six months in an abusive home, despite signs \"heavily suggestive\" of penetrative anal abuse, before the local authority's solicitor agreed there was sufficient evidence to test in court. Criticising the idea that social workers should work with abusive or neglectful parents, the paediatricians say: \"You do not enter into partnership with criminals during the investigation of a crime until the crime has stopped and the criminal has confessed and expressed remorse.\" Jo Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said social work had been \"overly adversarial\" before 1990 and there should be no return to the practices of those days. She said that before the children act the principle reasons for taking children into care were behavioural difficulties and family problems. The health department said: \"Rigorous inspection, audits and research carried out through the 1990s show that the children act, in largest part, is serving children well. The act's supporting regulations and guidance are constantly being reviewed.\"",

Which is more or less what he did in ITV's <strong> Blue Murder </strong> : within the first half hour Mavers had taken his clothes off so many times that we could be in no doubt that this was an \"erotic thriller\". </p> <p>Mavers, as Detective Sergeant Adam Ross, started off as a standard-issue semi-bent copper, taking bribes to pacify his lap-dancing ex-girlfriend, but as soon as he met femme tr\u00e8s fatale Gale (Jemma Redgrave) he embraced crime with a passion. Gale and Adam went to it hammer and tongs: all she had to do was smoulder a little and he was ripping off his shirt and hopping on. And if that wasn't enough, Mavers took a gratuitous shower, got pounced on by at least two other women and showed his bottom not once but twice. Let's face it, that's just not going to happen in Peak Practice. </p> <p>Mavers played the confused, horny hunk rather well, which is a relief, as Blue Murder was posited entirely on the thesis that he is a major sex god. The wicked Gale bamboozled him into murdering her abusive husband, secure (she thought) in the knowledge that Adam himself would lead the investigation. But they hadn't reckoned on plucky, intuitive Detective Constable Vanessa Barlow (Emma Cunniffe) who saw through Gale's story and nearly got killed for her troubles. Gale persuaded superstud Adam to seduce the pesky plod, working on the theory that a woman in love is less likely to solve grisly murders than a thwarted spinster. </p> <p>Blue Murder had all the trappings of modern ITV crime dramas: gorgeous urban locations (they even managed to make Adam's block of flats, actually situated in Elephant and Castle, look attractive), wet streets reflecting neon lights, and the inevitable pole-dancing club. Once the plot got underway - and it took a while - it was gripping stuff with a vicious sting in the tale. Redgrave, also tasting freedom after the straitjacket of medical drama (Bramwell), attacked her role with a carnivorous relish, dispatching her spent lover to a suitably bloody death. There was one moment of high, tongue-in-cheek comedy: Emma Cunniffe had just established her character's feminist credentials in a heartfelt speech about women who keep taking off their clothes in order to further their careers - and lo, within a minute Mavers was once again naked and furthering his career. </p> <p>Channel 4's profile of <strong> The Real Lena Zavaroni</strong> formed a heartbreaking centrepiece to the Trouble With Food season. Lena was only 10 when she won Opportunity Knocks, left her home on the Scottish island of Bute and became a star in London. It's easy to forget how big a star she was: for the next six years she was on TV practically all the time, while in America she hobnobbed with President Ford and Frank Sinatra. The enduring image is of an irritating little girl in knee socks making stagey leers at the camera, but on the evidence of last night's show Zavaroni was maturing into a considerable artist when illness struck. Anorexia nervosa kicked in during her teens, and by 1979 the cute little minipop was a haunted waif. Thenceforth there was no reprieve. She retired in the early 80s and set about destroying herself, while her friends and family looked on, helpless. By the mid-90s she weighed three-and-a-half stone and looked like a Belsen victim. </p> <p>It's tempting to blame the pressures of juvenile stardom for Zavaroni's illness, and it's true that she worked hard: agent and manager Dorothy Solomon recalled that she would never say no to work. But the problems, it seems, lay far deeper than that; towards the end, Zavaroni was a haunted figure, desperate for surgery to cut the demons out of her brain. She died last year, of a chest infection, three weeks after her operation. </p> <p>For all the horrors of Zavaroni's mental and physical collapse, the biggest revelation of the night was the magnitude of her talent. Those of us who remember her as a kitsch joke, belting out Ma! (He's Making Eyes at Me) in those awful Shirley Temple dresses, would be surprised by the maturity that she brought to tragic showbiz-is-rough ballad Going Nowhere, performed on her own TV show in 1981. The pain in her voice, and in her eyes, was unbearable.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ah, the mid 90s... A young Chris Farley taught us how to laugh, an ageing OJ Simpson taught us how to drive, and the citizens of Los Angeles taught us how to sack a city. Travelgate hadn't quite died down, Bubba Clinton had only just fired his $200-a-do hairdresser Christophe, and Paula Corbin Jones was still firmly attached to her old nose.</p> <p> After a miserable recession at the turn of the decade, the economy was rising phoenix-like from the toilet, and good times were just around the corner. Ahead lay scandal, outrage, rancid glamour, conspicuous consumption, and the swift and steady lowering of the general public's shockability threshold. </p> <p>And that was just in politics and current affairs. An era like this, however, needed its ur-cultural product, its primetime TV equivalent to the real-life filth and fury erupting at the top of every hour on CNN. The man who beamingly stepped up and provided it was Aaron Spelling. The show was high-school soap opera Beverly Hills 90210, now finally cancelled by Fox. </p> <p>Considered washed up in 1990, Spelling had in the previous 35 years brokered dozens of shotgun-weddings between TV glamour and TV trash, between beauty and bullshit, out there at the crossroads of high-class and tits-and-ass. There was always a great dumbshit hook to hang Spelling's shows on: Mod Squad basically tamed hippies and juvenile delinquents and made them palatable to the 68 audience that had just voted Nixon into office. Starsky and Hutch was blaxploitation for white folks (ie no black names above the credits, please) with a sideways nod to the emerging gay market, intentionally or not (I always assumed David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser slept innocently in the same bed, like Laurel and Hardy). Charlie's Angels (half copped from Ted V Mikkels' rotten 1974 drive-in movie The Doll Squad) was kung-fu hotties in halter-tops. Dynasty was soap on amphetamine overdrive with a movie-sized budget and yards of cleavage, while Hart To Hart was a soulless Thin Man update, with glammy, married private dicks. </p> <p>But 90210 was a little different. Spelling was brought in by Barry Diller, a graduate of Beverly Hills High who'd always wanted to set a TV show there. Having worked in Beverly Hills for several years in the 90s, I can assure you that the school's parking lot - thronging with surgically altered 16-year-olds driving Lexuses and HumVees, half of them on mood-stabilising medication - is one of LA's most disturbing alternative tourist attractions. Spelling, once Diller's boss, now his underling, was much taken by the idea and hired the true architect of 90210, writer Darren Star, a 28-year-old UCLA graduate who, in Spelling's words, \"knew teenagers\". </p> <p>Quite what the teenagers of Beverly Hills, with their liberal parents, ocean-deep trust funds and Rodeo Drive threads, had in common with the teenagers of say, Compton, was always hard to discern. Perhaps that was the point, though, because within a year the stars of the show, especially male leads Luke Perry and Jason Priestley, were being mobbed at malls across the nation (with Perry once having to be smuggled out of a fan-stampede in a laundry hamper). </p> <p>Once the second season was under way and the show moved into its classic incarnation, the cast received America's greatest unofficial accolade. In any mall or drive-in, at any prom or cheerleader audition in America between 1992 and 1995, one could see only six hair-cuts, all of them previously sported by 90210 cast members. </p> <p>Appropriately for a show that styled itself as scandalous and in-your-face, the cast members proved to be tabloid catnip, particularly Shannen Doherty, who was fired after a catalogue of bratty onset misdemeanours (the words \"bitch\" and \"late\" featured prominently in unattributed quotes from her colleagues) and whose career went south immediately thereafter, in a cloud of court cases and anger-management programmes.

      "bodyText": "Ah, the mid 90s... A young Chris Farley taught us how to laugh, an ageing OJ Simpson taught us how to drive, and the citizens of Los Angeles taught us how to sack a city. Travelgate hadn't quite died down, Bubba Clinton had only just fired his $200-a-do hairdresser Christophe, and Paula Corbin Jones was still firmly attached to her old nose. After a miserable recession at the turn of the decade, the economy was rising phoenix-like from the toilet, and good times were just around the corner. Ahead lay scandal, outrage, rancid glamour, conspicuous consumption, and the swift and steady lowering of the general public's shockability threshold. And that was just in politics and current affairs. An era like this, however, needed its ur-cultural product, its primetime TV equivalent to the real-life filth and fury erupting at the top of every hour on CNN. The man who beamingly stepped up and provided it was Aaron Spelling. The show was high-school soap opera Beverly Hills 90210, now finally cancelled by Fox. Considered washed up in 1990, Spelling had in the previous 35 years brokered dozens of shotgun-weddings between TV glamour and TV trash, between beauty and bullshit, out there at the crossroads of high-class and tits-and-ass. There was always a great dumbshit hook to hang Spelling's shows on: Mod Squad basically tamed hippies and juvenile delinquents and made them palatable to the 68 audience that had just voted Nixon into office. Starsky and Hutch was blaxploitation for white folks (ie no black names above the credits, please) with a sideways nod to the emerging gay market, intentionally or not (I always assumed David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser slept innocently in the same bed, like Laurel and Hardy). Charlie's Angels (half copped from Ted V Mikkels' rotten 1974 drive-in movie The Doll Squad) was kung-fu hotties in halter-tops. Dynasty was soap on amphetamine overdrive with a movie-sized budget and yards of cleavage, while Hart To Hart was a soulless Thin Man update, with glammy, married private dicks. But 90210 was a little different. Spelling was brought in by Barry Diller, a graduate of Beverly Hills High who'd always wanted to set a TV show there. Having worked in Beverly Hills for several years in the 90s, I can assure you that the school's parking lot - thronging with surgically altered 16-year-olds driving Lexuses and HumVees, half of them on mood-stabilising medication - is one of LA's most disturbing alternative tourist attractions. Spelling, once Diller's boss, now his underling, was much taken by the idea and hired the true architect of 90210, writer Darren Star, a 28-year-old UCLA graduate who, in Spelling's words, \"knew teenagers\". Quite what the teenagers of Beverly Hills, with their liberal parents, ocean-deep trust funds and Rodeo Drive threads, had in common with the teenagers of say, Compton, was always hard to discern. Perhaps that was the point, though, because within a year the stars of the show, especially male leads Luke Perry and Jason Priestley, were being mobbed at malls across the nation (with Perry once having to be smuggled out of a fan-stampede in a laundry hamper). Once the second season was under way and the show moved into its classic incarnation, the cast received America's greatest unofficial accolade. In any mall or drive-in, at any prom or cheerleader audition in America between 1992 and 1995, one could see only six hair-cuts, all of them previously sported by 90210 cast members. Appropriately for a show that styled itself as scandalous and in-your-face, the cast members proved to be tabloid catnip, particularly Shannen Doherty, who was fired after a catalogue of bratty onset misdemeanours (the words \"bitch\" and \"late\" featured prominently in unattributed quotes from her colleagues) and whose career went south immediately thereafter, in a cloud of court cases and anger-management programmes. Goodie-goodie Jason Priestley had to endure headlines about heroin ODs (false) and drunk driving (true). Spelling's daughter Tori had to deal with accusations of nepotism and rumours of massive taxiderminological intervention in the chest and cheekbone regions. Jenny Garth and Iain Zeiring, meanwhile, only had to cope with rumours that they were too useless to find better jobs. No one was a 90210 fan for the whole 10 years. For me, the glory years were 1994 to 1996. Although I must have seen 60 episodes in that time, I find I'm pressed to recollect a single concrete plot detail. By then Shannen was history, replaced as top bad girl by the insanely voluptuous Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, the best scheming tramp of the whole Spelling-Star universe.

But the slovenly application of the vague rules led to the Romans' dates becoming misaligned with the seasons. Julius Caesar fixed this by having 460 days in 46 BC.

January 1 was always A and the days of the week were lettered up to G. That means that if the first day of the year was a Friday all Fridays in that year would be an A.

The sixth day counted (inclusively) back from March 1 is counted twice.

Thus the days we regard as February 24 and 25 in a leap year were just one day to the Romans. </p> <p>But does this apply to us? Definitely \"yes and no\".

An abomination, but that's what it says. </p> <p>Legally, then, the 29 is the extra day. But historical truth shows that the bissextile day must be the 24.

Disregarding the origin of the bissextile day, the Act also declared that henceforth the day added should be considered to be February 29. An abomination, but that's what it says. Legally, then, the 29 is the extra day. But historical truth shows that the bissextile day must be the 24. And maybe the 25, too. \u0095 Duncan Steel teaches physics at the university of Salford.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Certain humans do the impossible almost every day. They are batsmen facing a fast ball. They do not have enough time to calculate how to hit the ball, and they only just have time to hit it. Robert Adair of Yale university has done the physics to prove that what batsmen do ought to be impossible in a time measured in thousandths of a second. </p> <p>Consider the problem of a man supposed to take a length of timber and swing it in an arc with all his strength to smash into a ball directed towards him from 60 feet away at a speed of 90mph, he told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting which ended in Washington DC on Tuesday. </p> <p>\"When we calculate that the time required for a major league fast ball to travel from pitcher to plate to be about 400 milliseconds, we can see that the batter is faced with a totally impossible problem.\" </p> <p>Yet major league players did it anyhow. The task was theoretically impossible because the minimum muscular response to a visual signal - the blink of an eye in response to a flash of light - was about 150 thousandths of a second. </p> <p>Look at it from a batsman's point of view, he told a seminar on the physics of baseball. Information took about 25 milliseconds to be turned into electrical pulses in the retina. These pulses had to get from the sensory cells in the retina to the bundle of nerve fibres that processed information at the back of the brain. Signals might travel at nearly the speed of light down a copper wire, but they slowed down to 200 mph along the nervous system. So the information took about 20 milliseconds to reach the back of the brain, and about another 30 milliseconds before it could be turned into a picture. </p> <p>But even 75 milliseconds after the ball left the pitcher's hand, the eye needed more data before the brain could calculate the ball's trajectory. </p> <p>At 100 milliseconds, the ball would already have travelled 14 feet, and be one quarter of the way towards the plate. At that point, the batter did not have nearly enough information about the ball's speed. On the other hand, if he left the decision any later, he would not have time to make his swing. </p> <p>\"With 75 milliseconds required to process that last informative picture added to the 100 milliseconds, the brain-computer picture gets to 'think' about the pitch only after 175 milliseconds have elapsed and the fast ball is three eighths of the way through its trip to the plate,\" Dr Adair said. </p> <p>By the time the batter had made the decision, and his brain had begun to send messages to arm and leg muscles, 225 milliseconds had elapsed and a swing which takes 150 milliseconds had begun.

      "bodyText": "Certain humans do the impossible almost every day. They are batsmen facing a fast ball. They do not have enough time to calculate how to hit the ball, and they only just have time to hit it. Robert Adair of Yale university has done the physics to prove that what batsmen do ought to be impossible in a time measured in thousandths of a second. Consider the problem of a man supposed to take a length of timber and swing it in an arc with all his strength to smash into a ball directed towards him from 60 feet away at a speed of 90mph, he told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting which ended in Washington DC on Tuesday. \"When we calculate that the time required for a major league fast ball to travel from pitcher to plate to be about 400 milliseconds, we can see that the batter is faced with a totally impossible problem.\" Yet major league players did it anyhow. The task was theoretically impossible because the minimum muscular response to a visual signal - the blink of an eye in response to a flash of light - was about 150 thousandths of a second. Look at it from a batsman's point of view, he told a seminar on the physics of baseball. Information took about 25 milliseconds to be turned into electrical pulses in the retina. These pulses had to get from the sensory cells in the retina to the bundle of nerve fibres that processed information at the back of the brain. Signals might travel at nearly the speed of light down a copper wire, but they slowed down to 200 mph along the nervous system. So the information took about 20 milliseconds to reach the back of the brain, and about another 30 milliseconds before it could be turned into a picture. But even 75 milliseconds after the ball left the pitcher's hand, the eye needed more data before the brain could calculate the ball's trajectory. At 100 milliseconds, the ball would already have travelled 14 feet, and be one quarter of the way towards the plate. At that point, the batter did not have nearly enough information about the ball's speed. On the other hand, if he left the decision any later, he would not have time to make his swing. \"With 75 milliseconds required to process that last informative picture added to the 100 milliseconds, the brain-computer picture gets to 'think' about the pitch only after 175 milliseconds have elapsed and the fast ball is three eighths of the way through its trip to the plate,\" Dr Adair said. By the time the batter had made the decision, and his brain had begun to send messages to arm and leg muscles, 225 milliseconds had elapsed and a swing which takes 150 milliseconds had begun. It took around 15 milliseconds for a signal to get from brain to thigh and 10 milliseconds to distribute the signal through the muscle fibres. So the swing had to begin a quarter of a second (250 milliseconds) after the ball left the pitcher's hand if the bat was to meet the ball at 400 milliseconds. If the swing by a right handed batter was seven-thousandths of a second too early or late, he would connect but the ball would travel foul. In the first 50 milliseconds of the swing, the batter might be able to adjust the direction. \"At the end of that time, the bat is travelling at about three fourths of its final velocity,\" said Dr Adair. \"Even if the skilled batter can use this late data, none of the subsequent information from seeing the ball over the last half of its flight can be used at all. \"If it weren't psychologically upsetting, the batter could as well close his eyes after the ball is halfway to the plate, or if it were a night game, the management could turn out the lights. The batter would hit the ball just as well.\"",

      "body": "<p>You'll find it hard to avoid Neil MacGregor's vision of Christian art this spring. Seeing Salvation, a survey of representations of Christ over the past 2,000 years, opens at the National Gallery (where MacGregor is the director) on Saturday; a BBC2 tie-in fronted by MacGregor starts in April; the book, co-written by - yes - Neil MacGregor, is published at the end of March. Bibles are available in the National Gallery shop. </p> <p>There's an evangelical fervour to this project: MacGregor calls it \"the campaign\". Free to all, and sponsored by the Jerusalem Trust, a foundation set up \"to promote the Christian religion\", and the Pilgrim Trust, which gives grants for social and educational causes, the exhibition is being promoted as the National Gallery's exploration of the Christian heritage in art at the beginning of a new millennium. </p> <p>\"You can't tell the history of European painting, which is what the National Gallery does, without a large proportion of Christian subject matter,\" MacGregor argues. \"For a lot of people that subject matter is difficult. Most people feel somehow embarrassed talking about it in depth. If they do believe, they're nervous about being seen as proselytising; and if they don't, they feel it's not a subject for them to comment on. That seems to me very sad.\" </p> <p>The trouble with MacGregor's campaign is that it cries out for misunderstanding and misappropriation. He wants to make Christian art accessible to non-Christians, but the rhetoric of Seeing Salvation - not least its title - says the opposite. It looks like a celebration of devotional art that will delight the faithful and alienate everyone else. </p> <p>MacGregor has been acclaimed by sympathetic journalists on precisely those grounds, lauded for spurning political correctness and saying the unsayable, that western high art is Christian through and through. Like Kenneth Clark, a previous director of the National Gallery, in his famous television series Civilisation, he is championing the high art of Europe as a unique moral tradition. Of course, the last thing MacGregor wants to be is exclusive. \"You can't say the tradition is multi-cultural,\" he says, \"but what you can say, and what I believe very strongly, is that people from any culture can ask these pictures certain questions and will find in them very interesting subject matter.\" </p> <p>But is the history of western European art as Christian as Seeing Salvation implies? Michelangelo was accused of \"impiety\" by contemporaries who thought his Sistine Chapel decorations had more to do with showing off than with promulgating the faith. The Jewish population in Rome, according to the 16th century art historian Vasari, used to go regularly to look at Michelangelo's Moses. Where does European art begin and end? Visit the Great Mosque in Cordoba in southern Spain and you can see a Moorish architectural masterpiece vandalised by conquistadors who stuck a gothic cathedral in the middle of it. </p> <p>Christian art can be hypocritical and bigoted; it can exemplify exactly the reasons why most people would rather live in a secular society than in a theocratic state. Dali's vertiginous Christ of St John of the Cross, the poster image for Seeing Salvation, was painted in the early 50s at a time when he was trying to curry favour with the fascist regime of General Franco, whom he praised for \"imposing clarity, truth and order\" in Spain. </p> <p>The more MacGregor talks, the more personal his project feels. Perhaps it is best seen as his own interpretation, his understanding, of the collection he has been in charge of since 1987. Even the poster for Seeing Salvation contains an autobiography. For him, the meaning of Dali's painting has nothing to do with its origins in Franco's Spain but with what it means to Glasgow, where it has been since the city bought it in 1951. MacGregor was born in Glasgow in 1946. After studying in Oxford, Paris and Edinburgh he was called to the Scottish bar in his 20s before studying art history. He enthuses about the way this triumphantly Catholic painting is loved by Protestants too, how it unites Glasgow by transcending religious divisions. </p> <p>MacGregor was brought up a Presbyterian and is today C of E . His personal vision of Christian art is too emotional, too angry, for you not to see it as a declaration of faith. And that faith is very much about the alleviation of human suffering. Christian art is angry, he says. It wants you to act. </p> <p>\"Take the sculpture in the exhibition of the completely naked Christ,\" he says, referring to a late medieval Netherlandish statue, \"sitting, waiting to be nailed to the cross. It's a moment of humiliation, destitution - you can't be near that sculpture without feeling shocked, alarmed, horrified that a human being can be humiliated like this. If you are a believer, then of course there's an extra dimension, but even without being a believer, you go away reminded of the indestructible dignity of every individual and the unacceptability of anybody being humiliated like this.\" </p> <p>MacGregor shows me the space where the naked Christ will be installed. He says it is incredible to see Christ naked, to see his genitals. It's embarrassing. Images like this were made to provoke a visceral response. He thinks they still can if we let them. Seeing Christ as a tortured prisoner under sentence of death, \"you can either respond through tenderness or through acknowledging that your job is to minimise this suffering; and as it is clear that Christ is meant to represent everybody, that means you have to do something to relieve the suffering of the world. You're meant to go away from these pictures about to act differently: that's the purpose of them.\" </p> <p>Changing the world is what all artists worth their salt really want to do, he says, and not just Christian ones. \"If you speak to many contemporary artists it's clear that they hope their work will have a social dimension, a social resonance, and that ultimately people's behaviour will be changed.\" </p> <p>The National Gallery itself was founded on this belief. It was set up in 1824 as a free public gallery \"in the belief that great works of art change people and make them better. You may dispute that, you may feel that's not the case, but that's the assumption on which the whole place was made.\" </p> <p>MacGregor's vision of art is redemptive and radical, but not all great artists believe in God. Not all of them even believe in art. His exhibition does not, for example, include Francis Bacon. Bacon's fame began with his grotesque 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which could easily have been included with the paintings by Stanley Spencer and Graham Sutherland from the same period in the last room of Seeing Salvation. They saw salvation; Bacon didn't. \"I know for religious people, for Christians,\" Bacon said, \"the Crucifixion has a totally different significance. But as a non-believer, it was just an act of man's behaviour, a way of behaviour to another.\" </p> <p>Does Bacon's atheism mean his paintings lack humanity, truth, anger? \"A lot of Christian art is about the role suffering has to play in an ordinary life,\" says MacGregor. \"Francis Bacon's art is in many ways about the same question. I think it's fair to compare a Bacon image of suffering with a traditional Christian one. Which can work more universally? Which is better able to suggest that suffering is something universal in which we all partake?\" It's hard not to get the message of what he says about Bacon - he's not the first critic to be dismayed by the utter abjection of Bacon's art. So does art have to promise redemption to be truly great? </p> <p>MacGregor's passionate belief in art is not something you come across every day, and what he says has a prickly honesty. He is asking big questions, the biggest, about what art can do in the world beyond the gallery. The National Gallery is practically a world unto itself, a city of art, where you can spend hours in different times and places with great artists. But for its director that's not enough. \"When I leave the gallery this evening and walk home,\" MacGregor says, \"how am I meant to behave differently?\" It's just a short stroll from the National Gallery to Bacon's Soho, where you can pass the pub in Old Compton Street where three people were killed last year. The question is whether Christianity has anything to say about this or whether it is better understood, in Bacon's words, as \"an act of man's behaviour, a way of behaviour to another\". </p> <p>Seeing Salvation: The Image of Christ is at the National Gallery, London WC2 (0171-747 2885), from Saturday. Seeing Salvation is on BBC2 from April 2. The book Seeing Salvation: Images of Christ in Art, by Neil MacGregor with Erika Langmuir, is published by BBC Worldwide on March 30, price \u00a325.</p>",

Councils in South Yorkshire, Merseyside and Cornwall, which stand to gain \u00a32bn for six-year programmes designed to revive flagging economies, believe that the European commission is rapidly losing patience with Whitehall. Fears have been reinforced by Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy's claims of a \"real and looming threat\" to the so-called \"objective one\" schemes, designed for EU regions where wealth measured by GDP per head is at least 25% below the EU average. Mr Kennedy, whose party controls councils in the three areas, says is alarmed because he received no assurance that cash would be forthcoming at a recent meeting with Tony Blair. He added: \"The prime minister told me quite directly that the government could not make this commitment until the [next] comprehensive spending review was completed in June or July. I don't buy that. I can't see how the spending review will be disturbed by simply saying we've got objective one status and that support will be forthcoming.\" Agencies co-ordinating programmes in the three areas are concerned because the review will not influence government spending until April 2001 when the programmes should be in full swing. Under new Brussels guidelines, the commission will quickly begin clawing back tranches of aid unless member states show that matching funds are available - \u00a32bn over six years in England's case. Brussels has now written to officials in the three areas pointedly asking them to \"detail more precisely\" how they will provide match funding. But in a letter to the agency co-ordinating the programme in South Yorkshire, the department of trade and industry, says it is the responsibility of local councils, and other bodies, to find the necessary cash - not the government. Geoff Fieldsend, the official co-ordinating South Yorkshire's \u00a3800m programme, said there was a \"massive problem\" in finding funds in a county - one of the poorest areas of Europe - which had been battered by the rundown of the coal and steel industries. The education secretary, David Blunkett, MP for Sheffield Brightside, has faced strong criticism of the government's stand at recent meetings in South Yorkshire. In turn, he has criticised a \"can't do\" attitude in Whitehall. Although the issue of match-funding for a much larger objective one programme in Wales led to the recent resignation of Alun Michael as first secretary, English councils claim Cardiff enjoys far more flexibility in moving cash between departments than Whitehall. Consequently, they argue it should be able to satisfy Brussels initially. Concern is growing in Cornwall, the poorest county in England, where the GDP is 73% of the EU average.

The former Greater London council leader broke his silence to warn that the mayoral election would become a \"referendum on London's right to govern itself\" unless the tube policy - endorsed yesterday by Labour's official candidate, Frank Dobson - was abandoned. Labour's Millbank headquarters feared the statement might be a defining moment and the cabinet office minister Ian McCartney said Mr Livingstone should \"stop playing games\", but other Labour sources believed the declaration was intended to leave a way out of the crisis for both sides. \"There seems to be an absolute panic at Millbank over the opinion polls,\" Mr Livingstone said last night, adding that he had received more than 1,000 emails and 350 letters during the day pressing him to stand. Labour's leadership is understood to be increasingly alarmed by the risks of damage to the party's position in London, with the first signs that an independent Livingstone campaign could potentially lead to union disaffiliations, as well as resignations and expulsions of members. The left-led Rail Maritime and Transport union's London regional council yesterday denounced the Labour mayoral selection as a fix and called on Mr Livingstone to stand as an independent candidate \"based on the massive democratic mandate given him by our movement - we believe it is Ken's duty to do so\". Officials of the Labour-affiliated union said that they planned to censure Vernon Hince, the RMT assistant general secretary and Labour chairman, whose private correspondence with Mr Livingstone was published by the Labour party yesterday and who had claimed the union was backing Mr Dobson. Millbank said trade unions who supported an independent Livingstone campaign against Mr Dobson would not necessarily have to disaffiliate from the party, but with some unions such as the firefighters already toying with a break with Labour, the potential fallout could be far-reaching.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Japanese gamers flocked to a special exhibition in Tokyo at the weekend for their first look at the Sony PlayStation 2. Widely accepted as the best games console produced so far, it will go on sale on March 4 for less than 40,000 yen (about \u00a3250). And it's expected to sell a million units on the first day. </p> <p>But British gamers had different questions, such as: How long will I have to wait? How much will it cost in the UK? And will it really run my old PlayStation games? </p> <p>I went to Sony's offices just off Oxford Street in the centre of London to ask the two men responsible for coming up with the answers: Ray Maguire, UK managing director of Sony Computer Entertainment, the games division, and his director of marketing, Alan Welsman. And while they were still working on the details, the direction was clear. </p> <p>\"Ken Kutaragi, the inventor of the PlayStation, has this dream of computer entertainment,\" says Maguire, \"the device in the front room as the conduit for all forms of entertainment. That's the long-term vision. When there's an infrastructure which can support that, that's what we'll have. The PlayStation 2 is the first product in realising that dream: it has all the connectivity you need for just about all digital inputs and outputs. It will be presented as the world's best games machine, but in time, as the cable infrastructure gets into people's houses, we'll utilise that network in putting other forms of computer entertainment in front of consumers.\" </p> <p>As Kutaragi puts it: \"What we are aiming for is a world of digital entertainment that transcends games. PlayStations will undoubtedly be connected to televisions in the home. We are consciously aiming to integrate games, movies, and music. Add to this a network, and in five or six years, when PlayStation 3 comes out, the door will open to a completely new world.\" </p> <p>The missing word is \"convergence\". A lot of companies are predicting a world where games, music and films will all be purchased and downloaded from the internet, rather than delivered on compact discs. But if it turns out that people want to download content from Sony Music and Sony Pictures and Sony websites to their Sony PlayStations, which are plugged into their Sony television sets and Sony hi-fis, I won't be a bit surprised. </p> <p>To begin with, of course, the PlayStation 2 is based on a DVD drive, so it can be used as a movie player, and a CD audio player, as well as a games console. This should broaden the market and attract older consumers, not just the ones who have grown up with games. </p> <p>It has a Sony i.Link high-speed connection compatible with an industry standard called 1394, which can be used to connect a hard disc drive or a digital video camera. It also has a standard PCMCIA card slot for adding a modem. Unlike Sega's Dreamcast console, the PlayStation 2 doesn't come with one. </p> <p>\"If you specified a modem today,\" says Maguire, \"it would soon be out of date. You should be able to specify the kind of connection you want. We'll be able to use technology as technology advances outside our control.\" In the future, the company may need to support cable, ADSL telephone connections and other types of link, not just dial-up modems. </p> <p>At the same time, the PlayStation 2 looks backwards: it will still play games written for the original version. Console buyers are used to dumping their expensive games when a next-generation machine appears, but backwards compatibility is part of Sony's attempt not just to dominate one generation of games machines - as Atari, Nintendo and Sega have done - but to dominate successive generations. </p> <p>\"In reality, [compatibility] shouldn't even be a consideration,\" says Welsman. \"You should be able to use your old software on your new machine. It's a great thing to show respect for the consumers who've ploughed money into the first one. We're very keen not to lose our core support, and we're very mindful that, as you and others have said, nobody's ever done it twice. The backwards compatibility shows how we're thinking about our core audience. </p> <p>\"The last thing we need is a multimedia machine that no one understands.\" </p> <p>The company also wants to maintain sales of the PlayStation, rather than replace it immediately with the PlayStation 2. Gamers will be encouraged to buy the original knowing they will still be able to play their games when they upgrade to the more expensive model. (Apparently all but 15 third- party games which didn't follow the design rules will run.) And as Maguire points out, PlayStation sales are booming in places like Eastern Europe \"where prices have come down to a more affordable level\". </p> <p>Price and delivery dates for the PlayStation 2 are more difficult. \"In the autumn\" is the company line. \"It will depend on demand in Japan and how many machines are needed to feed that market,\" says Maguire, \"and on the yields in the chip factories. </p> <p>\"There are so many factors it will be quite late in the day before we've got any idea of the actual release date, price or numbers.

      "bodyText": "Japanese gamers flocked to a special exhibition in Tokyo at the weekend for their first look at the Sony PlayStation 2. Widely accepted as the best games console produced so far, it will go on sale on March 4 for less than 40,000 yen (about \u00a3250). And it's expected to sell a million units on the first day. But British gamers had different questions, such as: How long will I have to wait? How much will it cost in the UK? And will it really run my old PlayStation games? I went to Sony's offices just off Oxford Street in the centre of London to ask the two men responsible for coming up with the answers: Ray Maguire, UK managing director of Sony Computer Entertainment, the games division, and his director of marketing, Alan Welsman. And while they were still working on the details, the direction was clear. \"Ken Kutaragi, the inventor of the PlayStation, has this dream of computer entertainment,\" says Maguire, \"the device in the front room as the conduit for all forms of entertainment. That's the long-term vision. When there's an infrastructure which can support that, that's what we'll have. The PlayStation 2 is the first product in realising that dream: it has all the connectivity you need for just about all digital inputs and outputs. It will be presented as the world's best games machine, but in time, as the cable infrastructure gets into people's houses, we'll utilise that network in putting other forms of computer entertainment in front of consumers.\" As Kutaragi puts it: \"What we are aiming for is a world of digital entertainment that transcends games. PlayStations will undoubtedly be connected to televisions in the home. We are consciously aiming to integrate games, movies, and music. Add to this a network, and in five or six years, when PlayStation 3 comes out, the door will open to a completely new world.\" The missing word is \"convergence\". A lot of companies are predicting a world where games, music and films will all be purchased and downloaded from the internet, rather than delivered on compact discs. But if it turns out that people want to download content from Sony Music and Sony Pictures and Sony websites to their Sony PlayStations, which are plugged into their Sony television sets and Sony hi-fis, I won't be a bit surprised. To begin with, of course, the PlayStation 2 is based on a DVD drive, so it can be used as a movie player, and a CD audio player, as well as a games console. This should broaden the market and attract older consumers, not just the ones who have grown up with games. It has a Sony i.Link high-speed connection compatible with an industry standard called 1394, which can be used to connect a hard disc drive or a digital video camera. It also has a standard PCMCIA card slot for adding a modem. Unlike Sega's Dreamcast console, the PlayStation 2 doesn't come with one. \"If you specified a modem today,\" says Maguire, \"it would soon be out of date. You should be able to specify the kind of connection you want. We'll be able to use technology as technology advances outside our control.\" In the future, the company may need to support cable, ADSL telephone connections and other types of link, not just dial-up modems. At the same time, the PlayStation 2 looks backwards: it will still play games written for the original version. Console buyers are used to dumping their expensive games when a next-generation machine appears, but backwards compatibility is part of Sony's attempt not just to dominate one generation of games machines - as Atari, Nintendo and Sega have done - but to dominate successive generations. \"In reality, [compatibility] shouldn't even be a consideration,\" says Welsman. \"You should be able to use your old software on your new machine. It's a great thing to show respect for the consumers who've ploughed money into the first one. We're very keen not to lose our core support, and we're very mindful that, as you and others have said, nobody's ever done it twice. The backwards compatibility shows how we're thinking about our core audience. \"The last thing we need is a multimedia machine that no one understands.\" The company also wants to maintain sales of the PlayStation, rather than replace it immediately with the PlayStation 2. Gamers will be encouraged to buy the original knowing they will still be able to play their games when they upgrade to the more expensive model. (Apparently all but 15 third- party games which didn't follow the design rules will run.) And as Maguire points out, PlayStation sales are booming in places like Eastern Europe \"where prices have come down to a more affordable level\". Price and delivery dates for the PlayStation 2 are more difficult. \"In the autumn\" is the company line. \"It will depend on demand in Japan and how many machines are needed to feed that market,\" says Maguire, \"and on the yields in the chip factories. \"There are so many factors it will be quite late in the day before we've got any idea of the actual release date, price or numbers. But everyone within this office would like to see it no more than the price of the PlayStation when it was launched here: that's what they've done in Japan. A hundred times the machine at the same price.\" At \u00a3299.99, the PlayStation 2 could be considered cheap, since it's based on two massive custom chips that could cost \u00a3300 on their own. However, the games industry has a razor-and-blades business model, where the consoles are sold at the lowest possible price to create a market for profitable games. Maguire even argues that allowing competitors to make rival versions of the PlayStation 2 - which Sega tried with its Saturn console - would lead to higher prices. \"They'd have to make a profit out of it as well, so the price to the consumer would have to be higher. If we look after this ourselves, the hardware price to the consumer can be as low as possible,\" he says. But if there's no money in hardware, why not sell consoles directly to the public, and cut out the retail and distribution overheads and profits? For a second, Maguire's office falls strangely silent. The retail trade, especially the independent dealers, played a big part in the success of the PlayStation, which has now shipped more than 5 million units in the UK, and more than 70 million world wide. \"We're thinking about all routes to market right now,\" says Maguire. \"The PlayStation is sold direct in Japan, and our competitors also sell direct in this country as well. I think it's a natural evolution.\" Selling direct could also make it simpler to cope with supply problems, given that there's already huge demand for the product. \"The hype is extraordinary, but the reality is that we firmly believe we have to earn every single unit out there,\" Maguire says firmly. They certainly had to work their socks off when the first PlayStation came out. Then, Sony had no track record in the games business, which was dominated by Sega's MegaDrive. Now, it should be easy. Sony is the market leader, and the PlayStation had more than 70% of the console games software market in January, on independent ChartTrack figures - roughly 10 times as many as its nearest competitor. However, Sony Computer Entertainment achieved its initial success by operating as a start-up company, an independent republic. With the PlayStation 2 destined to become the focal point for a wide range of Sony products, won't that independence be lost? \"In fact it's the other way around,\" Maguire replies. \"As SCE grows and produces more value to the corporation, we become more independent spirited. We have to have that single focus: presenting our product in the way that consumers want it. I'd hate things to get normalised across the group. Everyone that works in the building - and for Alan and me, that goes back to 1993 - has got the same passion now for the PlayStation 2 launch as we had for the PlayStation 1.

I fear for my family,\" says Tony Carpenter. \"I've got nothing to lose - you can't get any lower than I am.\" </p> <p>That's why Carpenter is organising what he calls a crusade to get a fair deal for people like himself. Like many 21st century crusaders, his chosen weapon is the internet. Unlike them, Carpenter is 71, and is using his role on a website called <a href=\"http://www.vavo.com\">Vavo</a> to bind fellow pensioners into a protest group. His first target: the government's planned 75p increase to the state pension. </p> <p>\"Don't hesitate to write to your MP and tell them how you think they should be doing their job,\" barks Vavo's site, which has 30,000 regular visitors among the UK's over-45s, and has had a total of 550,000 visitors since it launched six months ago. </p> <p>Carpenter's fellow crusaders are right behind him: three MPs have called Carpenter and another eight have emailed him after Vavo's newly-militant pensioners showered them with protest letters. </p> <p>In his politics forum - \"where grey has its say\" - you can find a list of which MPs have agreed to support a higher increase to the state pension, instructions on how to write to the others, even a set of form letters. \"Tony Carpenter's aim is to get millions of people to say, 'if you don't treat us with respect, we will not vote for you again',\" warns Vavo's development director, Richard Spinks. </p> <p>But Carpenter's protest politics is only one aspect of Vavo, one of the newest of the net's online communities. Like web-based social clubs, communities give users the chance to meet in chat rooms, swap information and make friends. It's a model that has worked for twenty- and thirty-somethings, where sites like FortuneCity, a free home site, count their memberships in the hundreds of thousands. Vavo's Spinks was one of the founders of FortuneCity - but being a relative youngster at 33, he had no idea that a European site for \"third-agers\" could work in the same way. </p> <p>He changed his mind after his recently widowed and lonely father-in-law came to live with him. Spinks encouraged him to make friends in US-based senior citizen chatrooms. \"One night I found he'd fallen asleep in front of the computer at 4:30am,\" he says. \"I couldn't get him off the PC.\" </p> <p>Soon afterwards, his father-in-law became the first member of Vavo. There are now 87 forums, but Spinks promises to leave the site's development to the users (they even chose the name, he says, vetoing any mention of age). He sells the advertising that pays for the site - it's sold out three months in advance - recruits the administrative staff and has already raised the capital to expand Vavo to Germany, Spain and Sweden. </p> <p>Spinks is also helping Vavo's members use their power to beat down prices, cutting special deals with the site's advertisers. For example, Vavo members pay no single room supplement at Sheraton hotels. </p> <p>He promises two insurers will launch low-cost health insurance packages for members this spring. His most ambitious stunt yet: organising members to band together and buy discount Volkswagen Polos. \"When I get 100 orders I'm going to Volkswagen's factory to negotiate,\" he says. \"Three months from now, we will have a set of financial products for over-45s that are the best on the market.\" </p> <p>Vavo's weapon is that companies and governments alike would love to be able to sell themselves to a group that numbers 19 million today, and will soon be the majority. According to the Association of Retired and Persons over 50 (ARP), by 2021 half the population of the UK will have celebrated their 50th birthday. While pensioners like Carpenter have no cash to spare, others form a powerful consumer lobby. Retired people spend \u00a325bn annually, ARP says: 84% buy holidays, 72% buy cars, and 43% buy financial packages. </p> <p>But Vavo's members are not there just to be sold to. \"Pensioners were taught to do as they were told. The politician was a man that we respected. That's why we allowed politicians to tread on us. And some of us are getting sick of it,\" says Carpenter. </p> <p>\"Sit in the corner and be quiet? No way,\" adds Helen Irvine, 51, who uses the site mainly for its chatrooms (\"On American sites they are appalling. No etiquette\") and runs a forum for horse-lovers. She's also organising the first Vavo group meeting: on the first weekend of March in a hotel in Nottingham. </p> <p>Making new friends now occupies much of Les Singleton's spare time. \"A mere baby\" at 47, he gets between 12 and 18 emails every day from new friends. \"I'm proud to be part of this. I'm amazed. But I'm not a nethead. I just like to talk to people.\" </p> <p>\"We have never been able to do something like this before because we've never had the means of communication. For the first time we can set up a network to do something for ourselves, and it's free from censorship,\" says Carpenter. </p> <p>\"Don't worry, we're going to make a go of this,\" he jokes. \"Unless MI6 comes around and bumps me off.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p> You're a programmer. Being multilingual means knowing C++ and XML; multi-culturalism means tolerating Windows programmers when you're a Unix devotee. You work long hours, you spend weekends curled up with programming manuals. So when holiday time rolls around, what could be more idyllic than a relaxing Caribbean cruise, talking computers with a few hundred others just like you? </p> <p> If this sounds like a vision of heaven rather than hell, Neil Bauman - or Cap'n Neil, as he signs himself - is prepared to make you a very happy geek. Bauman, operator of a new venture called <a href=\"http://www.Geekcruises.com\" target=\"_new\">Geekcruises.com</a>, is a purveyor of fine programming holidays to those whose motto in life is: \"I code, therefore I am.\" </p> <p>Bauman, a mid-40s self-confessed geek, has lined up computer-oriented seven to 10-day luxury cruises based around the unlikely topic of programming languages. The cruises bear whimsical titles such as Perl Whirl 2000, Java Jam, and XML Excursion. There's a European Linux cruise in the works for 2001. He bills them as \"high tech cruises for geeks and other computer professionals\" - presumably to accommodate those who do not yet feel self-confident enough to calls themselves geeks. </p> <p>Bauman is big on geek pride - and on convincing employers that they should reward hard-working technology employees with, say, a Perl Whirl cruise to Alaska. \"I think geeks have always been looked down upon in the corporate world as the guys with thick glasses and pocket protectors,\" he says, himself the picture of contented geekiness in a plaid shirt, worn corduroy trousers, bare feet - and thick glasses. Bauman works from a home office in geekdom's four star city, Palo Alto, California.</p> <p> \"The geek should be recognised as not just some grunt who sits in a cubicle,\" he argues. \"I think in some way, this elevates the stature of a geek.

      "bodyText": "You're a programmer. Being multilingual means knowing C++ and XML; multi-culturalism means tolerating Windows programmers when you're a Unix devotee. You work long hours, you spend weekends curled up with programming manuals. So when holiday time rolls around, what could be more idyllic than a relaxing Caribbean cruise, talking computers with a few hundred others just like you? If this sounds like a vision of heaven rather than hell, Neil Bauman - or Cap'n Neil, as he signs himself - is prepared to make you a very happy geek. Bauman, operator of a new venture called Geekcruises.com, is a purveyor of fine programming holidays to those whose motto in life is: \"I code, therefore I am.\" Bauman, a mid-40s self-confessed geek, has lined up computer-oriented seven to 10-day luxury cruises based around the unlikely topic of programming languages. The cruises bear whimsical titles such as Perl Whirl 2000, Java Jam, and XML Excursion. There's a European Linux cruise in the works for 2001. He bills them as \"high tech cruises for geeks and other computer professionals\" - presumably to accommodate those who do not yet feel self-confident enough to calls themselves geeks. Bauman is big on geek pride - and on convincing employers that they should reward hard-working technology employees with, say, a Perl Whirl cruise to Alaska. \"I think geeks have always been looked down upon in the corporate world as the guys with thick glasses and pocket protectors,\" he says, himself the picture of contented geekiness in a plaid shirt, worn corduroy trousers, bare feet - and thick glasses. Bauman works from a home office in geekdom's four star city, Palo Alto, California. \"The geek should be recognised as not just some grunt who sits in a cubicle,\" he argues. \"I think in some way, this elevates the stature of a geek. This,\" - he says with emphasis, gesturing at a row of brochures fanned on a sofa - \"is clearly worthy of a geek.\" More than 900 geeks apparently agree. They've sent e-mails asking for more information on the cruises, and Bauman sends out his glossy brochures in response.

      "body": "<p>Nicknamed the Wizard of Dribble in Britain, known abroad as Der Zauberer (the magician), Stanley Matthews, who has died aged 85, was the first ever European Footballer of the Year, and arguably the outstanding British player of his generation. </p> <p>His career stretched from well before the second world war to the 1960s; he was still playing League football at 50. At 41, at Wembley, he was capable of demolishing as famous a left-back as Brazil's Milton Santos. Afterwards, in the England dressing room, in a rare moment of spleen, he said that when he read that he was too old he was sometimes tempted to tear up the paper. </p> <p>But the truth is that throughout his career, Matthews was constantly accused of being too this, that or the other. Too unpredictable. Too individualistic. Too slow to release the ball. In one wartime Wembley international there was a small scandal when it was alleged that he had deliberately been starved of the ball. At the end of the war, when football officially restarted, he was excluded from the England team for most of the 1946-47 season in favour of Tom Finney, an outside-right with almost as remarkable a body swerve - only to return in triumph in Lisbon, Matthews on the right, Finney on the left, Portugal routed, 10-0. </p> <p>As early as November, 1934, when England won the bruising Battle of Highbury against an Italian team which ran amok when its Argentine captain, Luisito Monti, limped early off the field with a broken foot, Matthews was damned in the Daily Mail. Geoffrey Simpson, its sports columnist, wrote: \"I saw Matthews play just as moderately in the recent inter-League match, exhibiting the same slowness and hesitation. Perhaps he lacks the big match temperament.\" </p> <p>Matthews was born at Hanley in the Potteries, the son of a formidable boxer, Jack Matthews, \"the Fighting Barber of Hanley\". Jack encouraged all his children to keep physically fit, doing deep breathing exercises in front of an open window even on the coldest mornings. In later years, Matthews would devise his own regimes based on long runs across the Blackpool beaches. It used to be said that if you passed his house at 9pm, the lights of his bedroom would be out. </p> <p>His swerve was something which defied analysis; just as it defied attempts to counter it. He would take the ball up to the opposing left-back who, even if he were mentally prepared for it, would still \"buy\" the dummy when Matthews swayed slightly to the left, putting the opponent off balance, only to wriggle round to the right, flick the ball up the touchline with the outside of his right foot, and sprint away. Catch him if you could. Over those vital first 10 yards or so, he was beyond pursuit. \"Don't ask me how I do it,\" he once said of the swerve. \"It just comes out of me under pressure.\" </p> <p>He would opine: \"You must have butterflies.\" Butterflies in the stomach, he meant, before a game, building up adrenalin, anticipation. \"I'm not really with you,\" he told a journalist in the Stoke City dressing room immediately before his \"comeback\" game; a mere Second Division match; aged 46! </p> <p>Having sped past his left-back and reached the goal line, Matthews would then pull the ball back into the goalmouth; the most effective pass in the game. He seldom scored himself, but he could do so when necessary. Not least when playing at Tottenham for England against Czechoslovakia in 1937. Injury reduced England to 10 fit men, and their unbeaten home record against foreign teams seemed in jeopardy. But Matthews, moving to inside-right, scored three times, and England won, 5-4. </p> <p>Much later, in the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, when England were struggling in their opening game against Belgium, Matthews moved to inside-forward, galvanised the team, and helped it to gain a 4-4 draw. </p> <p>Over the years he would time and again fall foul of the England selectors, troubled by so maverick a talent. It is true that he began badly, a 19-year-old, in his first two internationals against Wales and Italy, but it wasn't long before the \"big match temperament\" was asserting itself. </p> <p>In May 1939, in the Berlin Olympic Stadium, he had one of his finest games for England just when they needed it most. Forced to give the Nazi salute before they played the German international side, England proceeded to cut them to ribbons, with Matthews rampant, irresistible against a full back who had played him out of the game when last the teams met. Muenzenberg could do nothing with him that day and England won, 6-3. </p> <p>An outstanding schoolboy footballer, he once scored a dozen goals in a game from centre-half. He played for England schoolboys, joined his local club Stoke City straight from school, worked in the office, and made his league debut for them soon after he had turned 17. But even before the war, his relations with the club degenerated with the appointment as manager of Bob McGrory, a former Stoke defender. It has been suggested that McGrory was displeased by the fact that Matthews had replaced his friend, Bobby Liddle, on the right-wing. Relations didn't improve when Matthews returned to Stoke after the second world war. </p> <p>During the war, he had played as a guest for Blackpool, a town where he and his wife, Jean, had opened a small hotel. Things came to a climax early in the 1946-47 season when Matthews was kept out of the Stoke team by the young winger, George Mountford. Eventually Stoke agreed to transfer him to Blackpool, for the sum of \u00a311,500. Matthews would stay there happily, forming famous wing partnerships with Stan Mortensen and Jackie Mudie, until his romantic and belated return to Stoke, in 1961. </p> <p>The war ate up much of his \"official\" career, but he found an ideal partner in the England team in Sunderland's Raich Carter, even though Carter once complained that when he gave Matthews the ball, he never got it back. Tactfully, his captain, Stanley Cullis, responded that having passed he should move into the middle. The England attack, which included Tommy Lawton and Denis Compton, was an outstanding one, with an 8-0 win over Scotland at Maine Road, Manchester, to its credit. </p> <p>Losing, then regaining, his place in the England team in the first official post-war season, 1946-47, Matthews excelled in Lisbon against Portugal and, a year later, in Turin, reduced poor, blond Eliani, standing in as Italy's left-back for Maroso, to tatters. England won 4-0. </p> <p>But when it came to cup finals, a winner's medal persistently eluded Matthews. In the 1948 final, Blackpool lost 4-2 to Manchester United, despite taking the lead through a penalty kick by Eddie Shimwell. In 1951, two spectacular goals by \"Whor\" Jackie Milburn enabled Newcastle United to win 2-0. It seemed that 1953 would almost surely be the last chance. Blackpool were to meet Bolton, and this time, luck favoured them when Bell, left-half - and thus a direct opponent for Matthews - was hurt and had to limp along the left-wing. </p> <p>Even then, Blackpool made very heavy weather of it. They conceded an absurd early goal when their Scottish international keeper, George Farm, pitifully misjudged a shot by Nat Lofthouse after a mere 75 seconds. Lofthouse hit the post, Bell tore a muscle and Bolton were already down to 10 active men. </p> <p>Stan Mortensen would later say that Bolton lost the game when they decided to move their English international left-winger Bobby Langton inside, rather than let him contest space with Matthews, on the wing. Blackpool's equaliser, 10 minutes from the break, was a fluke, the ball going in off their emergency left-half, Harold Hassall. But Bolton gallantly hit back with two goals, one by Moir, with Farm at fault again, the second a brave header by Bell himself. There were only 20 minutes left. </p> <p>It was now that Matthews, strangely obscure till then, at last came into the game. Tommy Banks, Bolton's left-back, was exhausted by his efforts to halt Matthews, contracting cramp in his shins, and four times leaving the field for treatment in the final quarter hour. One more Matthews run, a cross which would have gone out of play had Hanson, Bolton's keeper, not flapped at it, reached Mortensen on the far post and went in; 3-2. Mortensen equalised breathlessly from a free kick. </p> <p>Then, classically, Matthews got away again on the right, beat Banks, took the ball up to the centre-half, Barrass, and pulled back an exquisite cross, not to Mortensen but to the South African left-winger Perry, free on the far post. A right-footed shot and the Matthews final had been won by Blackpool. </p> <p>Would England have prevailed in the most humiliating match of their history, that defeat by the United States at Belo Horizonte in the 1950 World Cup, had Matthews played? Perhaps; but he didn't. Indeed it was only at the last moment that he was grudgingly recalled from an FA XI tour of North America to play in Brazil at all. He did play the last England game, lost against Spain in Rio 1-0, but the die was cast by then. </p> <p>Matthews's long marriage to Betty ended in 1968. He remarried, this time to a Czech linguist, Mila Winter, cultural assistant at the US embassy. </p> <p>He and Betty had two children, Jean and Stanley junior. The latter became three times British junior tennis champion, also won the Wimbledon junior invitation title. He never quite fulfilled his early promise, and eventually turned to coaching in the US. </p> <p>Knighted in 1965, a month before his 50th birthday, Matthews altogether made 698 appearances in the Football League for 71 goals, and played 54 full internationals for England for 11 goals. In 1963, he had the great satisfaction of helping Stoke City regain the First Division. </p> <p>A period as manager of Port Vale, after Stoke had rather sullenly parted company with him, reducing his wages and refusing him complimentary tickets, was ill-starred. The club fell foul of regulations concerning the signing of young players and Matthews was unfairly found culpable. </p> <p>He went on to live in Malta, where he played for the Hibernians team at 55, and to coach widely abroad, especially in South Africa, where he had first worked in 1954, and in Canada. </p> <p>He was to return to the Potteries. His wife Mila died last year. </p> <p>\u0095 Stanley Matthews, footballer, born February 1 1915; died February 23 2000</p>",

Writing in the scientific magazine Nature, the researchers say today that the number of species facing extinction far outstrips the resources needed to preserve them, and the situation is likely to become rapidly worse. By looking after the \"hot spots\" 44 per cent of the world's plants and 35 per cent of animal species would be protected, giving the greatest possible return on investment in conservation. Norman Myers, from Green College, Oxford, describes this as a \"silver bullet\" strategy by conservation planners. On present estimates between one-third and two- thirds of all the world's plants and animals will disappear in the foreseeable future. For \u00a3300 million a year, twice the cost of a single mission to Mars to search for extraterrestrial life, mankind could avoid a huge impoverishment of the earth which would take millions of years to rectify through the evolution of new species.

Silent vigils were held across the country after the Socialist politician Fernando Buesa and his bodyguard were killed in a car bomb attack on Tuesday. Adela Gooch, Madrid Girl held over massacre plot A 16-year-old German girl was last night facing attempted murder charges for allegedly planning a bloodbath at her school on April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine high school massacre in Denver, Colorado, when 12 pupils and a teacher were shot dead. The girl, from Waldsieversdorf, near Berlin, was arrested on Tuesday. AP, Potsdam, Germany New jail term for ex-drug tsar The disgraced former head of Mexico's anti-drug effort yesterday received a new 40-year sentence on drug charges. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, already serving 32 years on firearms charges, was convicted of transporting cocaine, organised crime and bribery. AP, Mexico City Paint victim slams sentence A black man who was painted from head to toe with toxic silver paint by a white South African farmer has criticised the leniency of his attacker's sentence. Frederick de Beer received an 18-month suspended jail term and fined \u00a3320 for kidnapping and assaulting Moses Nkosi near Johannesburg.

      "body": "<p>In 1971, a census was taken of the number of French-born citizens living in Britain. It turned up 21,000 people: a modest number but not altogether surprising to anyone who had lived on both sides of the Channel. Who would move to grotty old London if they had the good fortune to have been born in Paris?</p> <p>That figure is now an astonishing 200,000. The area around Bute Street in west London has long been known as a place where you are more likely to hear French spoken than English and for that reason is one of the most chic quarters of the capital. It is now, however, being talked of as a community of emigr\u00e9s that has grown out of all proportion to the natural ebb and flow of European migration.</p> <p>The French, needless to say, are not coming here for our fine education system. \"It is the flexibility, the quality, the speed - they are all higher here than in Paris,\" says Pascal Aug\u00e9, head of corporate banking at SG, the international arm of the French investment bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. He refers not to the British character, but to the state of the financial markets. Aug\u00e9 moved to London from Paris 18 months ago in recognition of its status as a major financial centre. \"The type of sophisticated deals you can work on here are better and the competition is much more active than in Paris because all the major banks are on the spot.\"</p> <p>There is some 168bn francs of French business invested in Britain, 20bn less than the level of British investment in France, and yet the number of French citizens who have chosen to follow their investments by moving to London is more than treble the traffic going the other way. The British embassy in Paris estimates that there are a mere 65,000 Britons living in France. The reasons for this are partly cultural - how many unilingual Brits could move to a country where they can only just ask for directions to the post office without having to reward themselves with a lie-down? But the primary factor - at least among the large numbers of French businessmen and women - seems to be financial.</p> <p>\"England's definitely the place to go to make money,\" says Bernard Antony. Three years ago, the 37-year-old moved from Paris to Cambridge, where he bought the Varsity Restaurant (est 1954) from his father. He had been working in Paris and the Champagne region, but, as a small business owner, found the cost of social security payments crippling.</p> <p>\"In France, the tax you have to pay when you employ people is horrendous. As a company you pay six or seven company taxes, so you don't have any money at all. It's more difficult to get a loan from the bank - even when you've got the collateral they can still say no.\"</p> <p>Antony employs mostly part-time workers whose salaries come to just over \u00a3500 a month. In France, he estimates, that figure would be nearer \u00a33,000. \"When you pay someone \u00a3600 in France, it will cost you another \u00a3600 on top in taxes.\"</p> <p>According to the financier Pierre Gerbier, a private banker at the Royal Bank of Canada who has helped 50 French millionaires move to Britain in the last year, the first great wave of business exiles from France occurred in 1981. \"When the socialist president was elected a lot of big French families - the old money - upped and left. It calmed down in 1986 when the rightwing government got in.\" In 1995 came the second big wave, when social security payments soared again and hopes, among the rich at least, that Jacques Chirac would bring them down came to nothing. \"A lot of people discovered that whether the government in place was rightwing or leftwing, the system was becoming worse by the day in terms of the tax burden.\"</p> <p>For the past six years, Laure Zaigue has run the French Bookshop in Bute Street. \"In that time,\" she says, \"the number of French people moving over here has definitely increased. People come for tax reasons and to find a job. Unemployment in France is very bad.\" (At 10.4%, unemployment in France is nearly double that of the UK.) If research by Knight Frank, the estate agent, is anything to go by, evidence of a snowballing French invasion is not entirely anecdotal. A recent review of property values concluded that one in seven new homes in London is being bought by Europeans, more than likely French. \"It's been murder on the phones,\" says the receptionist at the Lyc\u00e9e Francais, the French language school in Kensington. \"The number of people trying to enrol their children at the school has been growing steadily since 1995.\"</p> <p>The French embassy is reluctant to encourage this kind of undignified speculation, however. \"No, no it is not the case,\" says Laurent Lemarchand, its spokesman, bridling at the suggestion that growing numbers of his compatriots are chasing tax breaks in Britain. \"Over the last 12 months the number of French people in Britain has not increased. It has stabilised at about 200,000.\"</p> <p>So when was the last big exodus? \"1066,\" he says, drily. It is Lemarchand's opinion that the number of French in London is merely the natural consequence of European Union laws encouraging freedom of circulation. But Pierre Gerbier sees his reticence as an extension of the French government's denial of the brain drain. \"For a long time they tried to deny the fact that a lot of money was leaving the country. But in 1999, they indirectly recognised the movement by introducing three very tough measures which made it more expensive for French entrepreneurs to leave the country.\"</p> <p>This was primarily in the form of an exit tax imposed on unrealised capital gain for anyone who had more than 25% ownership in a business. For those who made the move - and many thought it worthwhile to shoulder the one-off exit tax for a cheaper life in Britain - the benefits have been manifold. \"It is a more relaxed way of life,\" says Pascal Aug\u00e9. \"I have taken to biking, which I never dared do in Paris. I'm even a more relaxed driver.\"</p> <p>\"The labour is cheap, the taxes are low,\" says Bernard Antony. \"We know lots of people who are thinking of moving here now. You have a better lifestyle in France, but who can afford it?\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1971, a census was taken of the number of French-born citizens living in Britain. It turned up 21,000 people: a modest number but not altogether surprising to anyone who had lived on both sides of the Channel. Who would move to grotty old London if they had the good fortune to have been born in Paris? That figure is now an astonishing 200,000. The area around Bute Street in west London has long been known as a place where you are more likely to hear French spoken than English and for that reason is one of the most chic quarters of the capital. It is now, however, being talked of as a community of emigr\u00e9s that has grown out of all proportion to the natural ebb and flow of European migration. The French, needless to say, are not coming here for our fine education system. \"It is the flexibility, the quality, the speed - they are all higher here than in Paris,\" says Pascal Aug\u00e9, head of corporate banking at SG, the international arm of the French investment bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. He refers not to the British character, but to the state of the financial markets. Aug\u00e9 moved to London from Paris 18 months ago in recognition of its status as a major financial centre. \"The type of sophisticated deals you can work on here are better and the competition is much more active than in Paris because all the major banks are on the spot.\" There is some 168bn francs of French business invested in Britain, 20bn less than the level of British investment in France, and yet the number of French citizens who have chosen to follow their investments by moving to London is more than treble the traffic going the other way. The British embassy in Paris estimates that there are a mere 65,000 Britons living in France. The reasons for this are partly cultural - how many unilingual Brits could move to a country where they can only just ask for directions to the post office without having to reward themselves with a lie-down? But the primary factor - at least among the large numbers of French businessmen and women - seems to be financial. \"England's definitely the place to go to make money,\" says Bernard Antony. Three years ago, the 37-year-old moved from Paris to Cambridge, where he bought the Varsity Restaurant (est 1954) from his father. He had been working in Paris and the Champagne region, but, as a small business owner, found the cost of social security payments crippling. \"In France, the tax you have to pay when you employ people is horrendous. As a company you pay six or seven company taxes, so you don't have any money at all. It's more difficult to get a loan from the bank - even when you've got the collateral they can still say no.\" Antony employs mostly part-time workers whose salaries come to just over \u00a3500 a month. In France, he estimates, that figure would be nearer \u00a33,000. \"When you pay someone \u00a3600 in France, it will cost you another \u00a3600 on top in taxes.\" According to the financier Pierre Gerbier, a private banker at the Royal Bank of Canada who has helped 50 French millionaires move to Britain in the last year, the first great wave of business exiles from France occurred in 1981. \"When the socialist president was elected a lot of big French families - the old money - upped and left. It calmed down in 1986 when the rightwing government got in.\" In 1995 came the second big wave, when social security payments soared again and hopes, among the rich at least, that Jacques Chirac would bring them down came to nothing. \"A lot of people discovered that whether the government in place was rightwing or leftwing, the system was becoming worse by the day in terms of the tax burden.\" For the past six years, Laure Zaigue has run the French Bookshop in Bute Street. \"In that time,\" she says, \"the number of French people moving over here has definitely increased. People come for tax reasons and to find a job. Unemployment in France is very bad.\" (At 10.4%, unemployment in France is nearly double that of the UK.) If research by Knight Frank, the estate agent, is anything to go by, evidence of a snowballing French invasion is not entirely anecdotal. A recent review of property values concluded that one in seven new homes in London is being bought by Europeans, more than likely French. \"It's been murder on the phones,\" says the receptionist at the Lyc\u00e9e Francais, the French language school in Kensington. \"The number of people trying to enrol their children at the school has been growing steadily since 1995.\" The French embassy is reluctant to encourage this kind of undignified speculation, however. \"No, no it is not the case,\" says Laurent Lemarchand, its spokesman, bridling at the suggestion that growing numbers of his compatriots are chasing tax breaks in Britain. \"Over the last 12 months the number of French people in Britain has not increased. It has stabilised at about 200,000.\" So when was the last big exodus? \"1066,\" he says, drily. It is Lemarchand's opinion that the number of French in London is merely the natural consequence of European Union laws encouraging freedom of circulation. But Pierre Gerbier sees his reticence as an extension of the French government's denial of the brain drain. \"For a long time they tried to deny the fact that a lot of money was leaving the country. But in 1999, they indirectly recognised the movement by introducing three very tough measures which made it more expensive for French entrepreneurs to leave the country.\" This was primarily in the form of an exit tax imposed on unrealised capital gain for anyone who had more than 25% ownership in a business. For those who made the move - and many thought it worthwhile to shoulder the one-off exit tax for a cheaper life in Britain - the benefits have been manifold. \"It is a more relaxed way of life,\" says Pascal Aug\u00e9. \"I have taken to biking, which I never dared do in Paris. I'm even a more relaxed driver.\" \"The labour is cheap, the taxes are low,\" says Bernard Antony. \"We know lots of people who are thinking of moving here now. You have a better lifestyle in France, but who can afford it?\"",

With imports rising strongly across the board the trade gap in goods and services almost doubled to \u00a315.5bn in 1999 - the second worst performance since 1989. Only Britain's traditional strength in services and the recovery in the global oil price prevented the figures from being even worse - with trade in goods alone showing a record \u00a326.3bn shortfall. The surplus on services stood at \u00a310.9bn, slightly down on 1998, while that on oil rose from \u00a33bn to \u00a34bn. In the past higher trade deficits have been an early warning of inflationary pressure building up in the economy. City analysts said yesterday that domestic demand was boosting imports while exporters faced being squeezed out of overseas markets by the strong exchange rate. The weakening of trade performance was most marked with countries outside the European Union - where the recovery of those affected by the Asian crisis in 1997 and 1998 fed through into rapidly expanding exports to Britain. The latest figures from the office for national statistics suggested that the overall trend has been deteriorating in recent months. The trade deficit in goods and services stood at \u00a34.8bn in the last three months of the year - up from \u00a32.6bn in the previous quarter.

The ONS also released data for non-EU trade in January, which showed the deficit in goods at \u00a32.4bn, up from \u00a32.3bn the previous month and almost double the \u00a31.3bn shortfall in September. For the year as a whole the trade gap in goods rose from \u00a35.3bn to \u00a36bn for EU countries and from \u00a315.2bn to \u00a320.3bn for non-EU nations.

It is also looking forward to promotion to the FTSE 100. </p> <p>The net security firm saw shares dip \u00a313.37 to \u00a3114 - a fall attributed to concerns that it could bite off more than it can chew after comments by chief executive Fran Rooney that Baltimore might look at more mergers and acquisitions. </p> <p>The comments were made as the group revealed losses for 1999 had grown from \u00a318m to \u00a331.4m, in line with analysts' expectations. Turnover rose 28% to \u00a337.6m on better software licensing sales. </p> <p>Analysts held their buy recommendations with Merrill Lynch saying it had a 12-month target of \u00a3145, buoyed up by the product deal with Compaq. </p> <p>The agreement will see Compaq and Baltimore bundling their products. The deal is seen as a way of fast-tracking Baltimore's sales in the US, after the recent hacking of Yahoo, Amazon and CNN which highlighted net security concerns. </p> <p>Last month, to aid this strategy, Baltimore bought American e-commerce security group CyberTrust for $150m. </p> <p>Broker Beeson Gregory is looking for 20% of the company's revenues to be sourced from the US this year, compared with 5% in 1999. </p> <p>\"Sales were lower than I'd expected,\" said David Johnson, analyst at Beeson Gregory. \"I think it's taken them quite a lot of time to build up a sales operation in the US.\" </p> <p>Baltimore's coming entry to the FTSE, with a review due on March 8, has led to the stock's rise over the past few weeks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Dublin-based Baltimore Technologies slipped yesterday despite announcements of a solid 1999 result and an agreement with American PC maker Compaq. It is also looking forward to promotion to the FTSE 100. The net security firm saw shares dip \u00a313.37 to \u00a3114 - a fall attributed to concerns that it could bite off more than it can chew after comments by chief executive Fran Rooney that Baltimore might look at more mergers and acquisitions. The comments were made as the group revealed losses for 1999 had grown from \u00a318m to \u00a331.4m, in line with analysts' expectations. Turnover rose 28% to \u00a337.6m on better software licensing sales. Analysts held their buy recommendations with Merrill Lynch saying it had a 12-month target of \u00a3145, buoyed up by the product deal with Compaq. The agreement will see Compaq and Baltimore bundling their products. The deal is seen as a way of fast-tracking Baltimore's sales in the US, after the recent hacking of Yahoo, Amazon and CNN which highlighted net security concerns. Last month, to aid this strategy, Baltimore bought American e-commerce security group CyberTrust for $150m. Broker Beeson Gregory is looking for 20% of the company's revenues to be sourced from the US this year, compared with 5% in 1999. \"Sales were lower than I'd expected,\" said David Johnson, analyst at Beeson Gregory. \"I think it's taken them quite a lot of time to build up a sales operation in the US.\" Baltimore's coming entry to the FTSE, with a review due on March 8, has led to the stock's rise over the past few weeks.",

These drugs are not licensed for children because they have only been tested on adults, and doctors who prescribe them for minors must do so without guidance from the manufacturers on the dosage or side-effects. </p> <p>So statistics are not kept in an organised way. Only when researchers choose to examine what is going on by asking questions of GPs or hospital doctors does a picture emerge of the use of adult medicines like anti-depressants. </p> <p>One such small study by the drug safety research unit at Southampton university looked at the prescription of SSRIs - the Prozac breed of antidepressants - for children aged 12 and under in 100 general practices. They found just 19 children on SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) - but the average age of these children was six, and they ranged from one year-old to 12. </p> <p>Of 10 children who were given Prozac tablets, three were said to be depressed and two were diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder. Two were anxious, one had febrile convulsion - a condition that affects small children - one had a mental disorder and the condition of one was described as unknown. </p> <p>Of those given Prozac as a liquid, one was constantly soiling, one was bereaved, one had behavioural problems and two were anxious. Among the others was a child with endogenous depression, which conventional wisdom says should not affect anybody under 30 to 40 years old. </p> <p>We know far more about Ritalin because it is licensed for use on children who have attention deficit disorder - hyperactivity.

      "bodyText": "Far less is known than most people imagine about the prescribing of medicines to children in Britain, because many are used in what is known as an \"off-label\" or \"outside the licence\" way. These drugs are not licensed for children because they have only been tested on adults, and doctors who prescribe them for minors must do so without guidance from the manufacturers on the dosage or side-effects. So statistics are not kept in an organised way. Only when researchers choose to examine what is going on by asking questions of GPs or hospital doctors does a picture emerge of the use of adult medicines like anti-depressants. One such small study by the drug safety research unit at Southampton university looked at the prescription of SSRIs - the Prozac breed of antidepressants - for children aged 12 and under in 100 general practices. They found just 19 children on SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) - but the average age of these children was six, and they ranged from one year-old to 12. Of 10 children who were given Prozac tablets, three were said to be depressed and two were diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder. Two were anxious, one had febrile convulsion - a condition that affects small children - one had a mental disorder and the condition of one was described as unknown. Of those given Prozac as a liquid, one was constantly soiling, one was bereaved, one had behavioural problems and two were anxious. Among the others was a child with endogenous depression, which conventional wisdom says should not affect anybody under 30 to 40 years old. We know far more about Ritalin because it is licensed for use on children who have attention deficit disorder - hyperactivity. The vast majority of prescriptions for Ritalin, in fact, will be for children. And the story with Ritalin is a massive surge in use, following the American example, once an initial reluctance to prescribe had been overcome. About five years ago, there were only about 2,000 prescriptions written for the drug and the manufacturers were considering withdrawing it from the UK market. But between 1996 and 1997, the numbers rose to some 92,000. The drug - a stimulant which helps people to focus on what they are doing - undoubtedly benefits some children with a serious case of the disorder. But in the UK, as in the US, there are worries that it is being over-prescribed for any child whose behaviour is causing parents and school serious difficulties.",
