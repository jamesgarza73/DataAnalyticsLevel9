But suffice it to say that Secretaries' Day does not turn over a lot of business here, and Bosses' Day does even worse. But as Britain's bosses face the annual disappointment of the postman passing them by yet again, they can take heart from a survey from DeskDemon, an internet portal for secretaries, which reveals that they are heartily approved of by their PAs. </p> <p>Or at any rate male bosses can: the women do not come out nearly as well. While the vast majority of those working as secretaries are women, when asked which gender they would prefer to work for, 64% said that they would rather work for a man; 30% had no preference, and a depressingly small 6% would rather work for a woman. </p> <p>Such sentiments swim against the tide. Even DeskDemon's CEO Mek Rahmani admits to being \"surprised\". Surprised, that is, and a little relieved: \"Being a male boss myself, it's good to see men receiving acknowledgement for being understanding and approachable bosses.\" </p> <p>It's a truism that in the modern, team-playing office, the ability to listen, to be accessible and to encourage are vital skills for any manager wishing to make his or her mark. It is also often assumed that these abilities come more naturally to women than to men. So what are the qualities that make male bosses so much more appealing? It turns out, according to the survey, that most secretaries believe it is men who are far better at listening, encouraging and being accessible: 42% of secretaries described male bosses as \"pleasant and easygoing\"; 26% described them as more \"approachable and understanding\". </p> <p>As so often happens when drawing out gender differences with a broad brush (or a survey), the sticking point in the all-female relationships is assumed to be jealousy. Nearly one-third of PAs who had worked for a woman claimed that their boss felt undermined by their abilities. Bitchiness ranks a close second, with 28% of PAs claiming to have been undermined in public by a woman boss. </p> <p>These negative reports are not neccessarily supported by outside observers. It has often been noted that in some fields, particularly media and especially public relations, ambitious secretaries are encouraged precisely because so many managers themselves began their careers in administration. But this window of opportunity may be closing, as media increasingly considers itself a more professionalised business, encourages graduate trainees, and draws a firmer line between management and support staff (although these days, of course, many secretaries tend to be graduates, too). </p> <p>All the same, when only 6% of secretaries in the survey claim that a male boss felt threatened by their talents, this may reflect over-confidence on the part of men rather than a selfless impulse to nurture talent. Yet it is disappointing to discover that 42% of secretaries felt they had been underestimated by a woman boss, whereas only 23% (still, admittedly, a sizeable proportion) of secretaries felt unappreciated by their male bosses. </p> <p>And given that women still lag behind in attaining senior management positions - about the only level of management that gets the privilege of a PA these days - it is not a good sign that women do extraordinarily well in \"the worst boss I ever worked for\" stakes: half of all secretaries elect a woman to that role, while 44% choose a man. It's a small gap, admittedly - but disproportionate, considering that women still make up only 22% of managers. </p> <p>Nevertheless, DeskDemon's survey is not an unrelenting condemnation of women's ability to form working relationships with their own sex. The average length of working relationship between female managers and their PAs is in excess of six years. This is almost double the average time that any PA stays in a job, so some women managers must be getting something right. </p> <p>It should also be noted that a couple of years ago Office Angels discovered that what few male secretaries there are tend to work for women managers. Perhaps, given the choice, more men would prefer to work for women.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Ask yourself a few questions about your boss. Does he or she spend the day enmeshed in meetings and only communicate via email and phone? Is your workplace populated with minions whose sole job seems to be to act as corporate bodyguards, blocking all contact between you and the person you work for?</p> <p>If so, you are working for an invisible boss. Supposedly busy, but in reality scared witless by their own lack of the management skills business gurus preach many bosses are currently becoming more remote than a Tibetan hermit. High-profile bullying and harassment court cases being brought against bosses by their staff make them feel less gregarious. </p> <p>Give it a go yourself. Pick your victim and get going on the phone. You will - I promise - get one of three responses:</p> <p>1. Someone you have never heard of before will tell you they are working from home, off sick or at a conference. </p> <p>2. Their PA will say they are in meetings all day, week or decade.</p> <p>3. You will be answered by voice mail.</p> <p>Assuming your boss has a function, though, you may well find yourself with a genuine need to communicate. Empowerment is all very well but sometimes we all need a little steer from above. So how can you cope when your boss has a habit of doing a Pimpernel? </p> <p>\u0095 Track, but do not attack. Stalk your prey out but without being seen. Check for any routines or rotas. Discover busy times and quieter times and plan to approach him/her during the latter.</p> <p>\u0095 Never plan the accidental meeting in anywhere like the lift or toilet, and then start talking business. This makes them nervous or stressed if they cannot even go for a pee alone. Try to make it feel as though they got talking to you, if possible.</p> <p>\u0095 Never get messages passed on unless this is the boss of bosses, someone so remote and omnipotent that face-to-face communication is unheard of in the company. Having said that, though, do not be too fazed by status. If you need to talk to someone you have every right, whatever their job title.</p> <p>If your boss is still unobtainable, book an appointment to speak with him or her. Make it in person, rather than over the phone. If you cannot get an early appointment, book one anyway for whatever date is available. One colleague of mine was offered the second week in January for an appointment to speak to his chief executive on the phone. His problem would not wait that long but he took the date anyway, just so he could tell the CEO that the system was not working. </p> <p>People avoid moaners and whingers, though. If you get the chance to speak, throw in some positives. So be concise and plan your communication in advance - or the heady excitement of having finally cornered your prey might be too much for you and you will start to babble in tongues. Write notes. </p> <p>Finally, make no more than three major points. Most invisible bosses suffer from ADS ( attention deficiency syndrome) and may become more withdrawn if you drown them with your monologue. And once you have made your points always agree on steps for future action. Summarise by re-stating those steps. If no actions are agreed then your hard work will all have been pointless.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ask yourself a few questions about your boss. Does he or she spend the day enmeshed in meetings and only communicate via email and phone? Is your workplace populated with minions whose sole job seems to be to act as corporate bodyguards, blocking all contact between you and the person you work for? If so, you are working for an invisible boss. Supposedly busy, but in reality scared witless by their own lack of the management skills business gurus preach many bosses are currently becoming more remote than a Tibetan hermit. High-profile bullying and harassment court cases being brought against bosses by their staff make them feel less gregarious. Give it a go yourself. Pick your victim and get going on the phone. You will - I promise - get one of three responses: 1. Someone you have never heard of before will tell you they are working from home, off sick or at a conference. 2. Their PA will say they are in meetings all day, week or decade. 3. You will be answered by voice mail. Assuming your boss has a function, though, you may well find yourself with a genuine need to communicate. Empowerment is all very well but sometimes we all need a little steer from above. So how can you cope when your boss has a habit of doing a Pimpernel? \u0095 Track, but do not attack. Stalk your prey out but without being seen. Check for any routines or rotas. Discover busy times and quieter times and plan to approach him/her during the latter. \u0095 Never plan the accidental meeting in anywhere like the lift or toilet, and then start talking business. This makes them nervous or stressed if they cannot even go for a pee alone. Try to make it feel as though they got talking to you, if possible. \u0095 Never get messages passed on unless this is the boss of bosses, someone so remote and omnipotent that face-to-face communication is unheard of in the company. Having said that, though, do not be too fazed by status. If you need to talk to someone you have every right, whatever their job title. If your boss is still unobtainable, book an appointment to speak with him or her. Make it in person, rather than over the phone. If you cannot get an early appointment, book one anyway for whatever date is available. One colleague of mine was offered the second week in January for an appointment to speak to his chief executive on the phone. His problem would not wait that long but he took the date anyway, just so he could tell the CEO that the system was not working. People avoid moaners and whingers, though. If you get the chance to speak, throw in some positives. So be concise and plan your communication in advance - or the heady excitement of having finally cornered your prey might be too much for you and you will start to babble in tongues. Write notes. Finally, make no more than three major points. Most invisible bosses suffer from ADS ( attention deficiency syndrome) and may become more withdrawn if you drown them with your monologue. And once you have made your points always agree on steps for future action. Summarise by re-stating those steps. If no actions are agreed then your hard work will all have been pointless.",

Yet it is one of the main reasons we work at all. And if you're a secretary in search of more of the stuff, the City and West End of London is where you need to be, according to a review carried out by recruitment company Crone Corkill. </p> <p>Surveying the wages of candidates working in Crone Corkill's City, West End and Richmond branches over the first six months of this year, compared with the same period last year, the review shows that junior secretaries are averaging \u00a317,000 with top PAs earning \u00a330,000 to \u00a337,000. They also admit to having placed a director's PA on a salary of \u00a347,000 and a business assistant at \u00a350,000, but those were the exceptions, not the norm, so don't get too excited. </p> <p>So what do we mean when we say City secretaries? \"Traditionally, the City was the finance industry and within one square mile of the Bank of England,\" says director of Crone Corkill Melanie Melrose. \"Now it really has extended, and includes Canary Wharf, and the industries include law, insurance, dot.coms, telecom and property companies. But really, when we talk of the City, we are talking of banking.\" </p> <p>The junior secretary sector has seen the sharpest increase in growth. West End salaries have risen, year on year, by 21%, ranging from \u00a314,000 to \u00a319,000; in the City they have increased by a similarly impressive 18.6%. Increasingly, it is graduates who are entering the market as juniors. But what do they look for? </p> <p>\"We have a higher number of graduates than before and a lot of them take a year out and temp. Not all of them want to go on the milkrounds and become accountants,\" says Melrose. \"Graduates realise that secretarial and administrative positions are a good career option. With keyboard skills, they could be earning a salary of \u00a318,000, which compares favourably with entry positions in other professions.\" </p> <p>Carolyn Asome, a languages graduate from Manchester University, has been temping with Crone Corkill for over a year. \"I've worked for Credit Suisse, First Boston and others, and you have to be very efficient, on the ball, and enthusiastic. Notoriously, banking pays the most. I'm probably earning twice as much in the City as I would working as a waitress,\" she says. </p> <p>And yet still there remains a scarcity of secretaries. \"Our survey reflects a shortage of really good candidates, with good skills and initiative, which is forcing employers to pay more to attract the best,\" says Melrose. So what skills do you need to earn all this cash? Are secretaries in the Smoke really any different from others? \"Technically, no, but you have to make sure your skills are up to scratch. You need to know packages such as Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. </p> <p>\"You also have to be commercially aware. You are entering a very particular culture, so you have to have a 'can do' attitude, be prepared to work very long hours - often you have to work late at a moment's notice. Secretaries who are flexible are the ones who get the most offers,\" says Melrose. </p> <p>So you might not get the time to spend all the money, but it's not just cash that's on offer.

Nobody, after all, seems quite sure if it's the agency or the host employer who is responsible for looking after them. Mel Draper, head of HSE's policy division, argues that \"although most recruitment agencies and host employers claim to exchange information on capabilities, training and health and safety features of the job, the fact remains that a poor level of awareness of health and safety legislation exists.\" </p> <p>As a result, temps may not be issued with safe and comfortable work stations, which are essential in decreasing the risk of ailments including severe back and neck pain and repetitive strain injury (RSI). In addition, they may not be using computers with glare-free screens and adjustable brightness and contrast controls that avoid damaging eye-sight. They may not be warned about fire exits and danger spots around the building, and they may be expected to work in an area surrounded by lethally stacked boxes and cabinets. And, crucially, they may not know at whom to direct their frustration when they find themselves confronted with these situations in an unfamiliar office. </p> <p>Suing a company for damages, now a widely accepted action for any one injured at work if the employer is to blame, is a further grey area for the temp. If they don't know if it's the agency or the hiring employer which is supposed to take reasonable care for their safety - and provide them with safe equipment, plant and premises, adequate supervision and proper training - then they don't know from whom to seek compensation. </p> <p>The HSE's report reveals that around half of all recruitment agencies do not have measures in place to ensure they are fulfilling their health and safety obligations, and that joining a smaller temping agency is particularly risky. In fact, research shows that, whether or not you're a temp, you are twice as likely to be hurt in an industrial accident if you work for a small firm than a large one. According to the Health and Safety Commission (HSC), many smaller businesses \"have greater difficulty understanding their legal duties and are unclear about the action they should take.\" </p> <p>So what's the solution? How can support staff - especially temps - make sure they're safeguarded in the future? According to Belinda Brooke, legal adviser for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), a good start would be for agencies, host employers and temps themselves to learn the facts about the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. \"In fact,\" she argues, \"we believe most agencies already know them.\" </p> <p>It works like this. There are two types of agencies: those, such as Manpower, where the temp is fully employed by the agency; and the majority, including Adecco, where the temp is engaged by the agency under a \"contract for services\". \"You'll only know which kind you belong to by asking,\" advises Brooke. \"In the first case, it's the agency that is the employer and health and safety is therefore its responsibility. </p> <p>\"In the second case, the responsibility is split. Before you go to any assignment, the agency has a duty to advise you of any accident or health-risk that could occur as a result of the type of work. Say you're doing a copytyping job, you could expect the agency to warn you that there'll be a lot of typing - so if you suffer from RSI, you would have the chance to refuse the job. Additionally, it must tell you who to approach within the host company to inform you about health and safety issues related to the premises.\" </p> <p>In both cases, adds Brooke, the employer has a general duty of care for anybody - even if they are self-employed - who is on their premises, but that is legally \"weaker\" than the Health and Safety at Work Act. \"It's complicated,\" she acknowledges, \"but worth getting your head round so that you can make sure you have minimised all risks before you begin any assignment.\" </p> <p>So complicated has the legislation become, admits the government, that over the past 18 months, it has, through the HSC, been looking at ways to simplify it. Revamping the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 could, for instance, be something of a solution itself. The problem is that the original act presumed that companies would continue directly to employ most of their workforce. It did not envisage large numbers of people being self-employed, part-timers or sub-contractors. And it certainly didn't envisage the fact that the majority of the secretarial sector would be temping. This means that the supply chain among businesses has become complex, once again leaving ambiguity about who is responsible for health and safety. </p> <p>A further way forward for secretarial staff may be to introduce tougher legislation that protects workers from violence at work. According to the HSE, there has been a significant increase in the number of violent attacks by colleagues and clients. And while the British Crime Survey does not have a specific category for workplace violence - making figures hard to come by - it does note \"acquaintance violence\" which accounts for about half of all attacks on men and a third of all attacks on women. An incredible 23% of these incidents involve a customer or client, and around 20% occur at work. </p> <p>\"Receptionists and other secretarial staff who deal with the public may be particularly at risk because they're often the first point of contact for aggressive customers or clients,\" stresses Sarah Simpson, training director for the Suzy Lamplugh Trust. \"There are, in fact, five pieces of legislation relevant to violence at work including, above all, the good old Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. But many employers think health and safety has nothing to do with personal safety. In consequence, a lot don't react until something terrible happens.\" </p> <p>Andrew Pemberton, director of Human Focus, a company helping employers to reduce accidents and health risks, is, however, resolutely positive about the future. \"We have opened the first UK centre aimed solely at helping employees with neck and spinal pain back to normal work duties, and it has been enormously popular. I'm the first to admit that I don't believe that's because companies are increasingly caring towards their staff. I believe it's because they are finally becoming more financially aware of health and safety. </p> <p>\"Health and safety failures cost Great Britain up to \u00a318bn per year. More and more companies are learning this by the day and if that's not a good enough reason to start protecting staff, I don't know what is.\"</p>",

In a genre marked by mawkish addiction to despair, she and older sister Shelby Lynne understand genuine tragedy. Fourteen years ago, when Moorer was herself 14, her father shot and killed her mother and then himself. Her current album, The Hardest Part, charts a relationship not dissimilar to that of her parents. However, Moorer sings directly of the murderous evening only once, in the harrowing Cold Cold Earth, which she performs alone. Extraordinarily raw and almost too close to home for public airing, when she whispers the \"two daughters he treated so terribly\" line, watching her feels like intruding upon the private grief of those 14 years. </p> <p>Moorer's rich voice has an authentic twang, more Billie Jo Spears than Faith Hill, but with the help of a sympathetic five-piece band she keeps it both country and universally accessible. As with the best of her peers and predecessors, Moorer - black vest, jeans, effective pout - presents her heartbreak in flirtatious fashion. \"Have you got your swollen organ?\" she teases keyboardist Michael Webb. He blushes underneath his beard. </p> <p>When Moorer transports herself into the centre of a song such as No Next Time though, the frisky mood alters. This nasty tale of a betrayed wife taunting her philandering husband with his own excuses is standard country fare, but in these assured hands its naked emotion transcends genre. Similarly the Oscar-nominated A Soft Place to Fall, taken from Robert Redford's flaccid film The Horse Whisperer: again, its lyrical sophistication (\"ask me anything but where I've been\") isn't sacrificed on the altar of porch homily. Is It Worth It, \"a song which makes me feel like my insides are on the outside\", is another divorce saga. Moorer plays the sultry, wounded siren in a manner that would scare the lights out of husband and producer Butch Primm, were he here and not back in Nashville. </p> <p>She can rock out, too. Long Black Train and the anthemic Send Down an Angel roar along like a less stodgy Pretenders, while her glorious wailing on guitarist Will Kimbrough III's broody showcase Don't Have a Gun suggests that if it went belly up today, she would conquer the backing vocalist circuit tomorrow.

      "byline": "Andrew Clements",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There's something about Herbert Wernicke's staging of Tristan und Isolde, the first of the Royal Opera's new productions this season, that reminds me irresistibly of hamsters. Breeding the rodents is a tricky business; they don't get on very well, and getting a pair to mate has to be approached carefully, bringing them together just for a few minutes to do the business and then separating them before they can kill each other. Wernicke treats these most famous of operatic lovers like that too: his set (he's done everything, including the lighting) consists of two colour-coded boxes - blue for the boy, blood red for the girl - and Tristan and Isolde are never allowed to leave these domains, as if close contact would cause them to tear each other limb from limb. Even in the second act the hamsters - sorry, the lovers - never approach within 10 yards of each other, never exchange glances; their boxes move suggestively together and the lighting becomes more elaborate as they get worked up, but that's about it. </p> <p>The director may be making the valid point that Tristan and Isolde's love is not only artificial (triggered by the love potion that Brangaene administers at the end of the first act), but also a self-centered emotion; that they are in love with the idea of being in love rather than with each other. But that is a very cerebral reading, and when it is combined with wooden acting from the two principals - their risible gestures should have gone out with Victorian melodrama - the result is desperately vapid. </p> <p>There are pitifully few other dramatic ideas: sailors in blazers and puttees greet King Marke's first appearance through megaphones and Tristan pulls himself on to Melot's sword at the end of Act 1; Brangaene's warnings in the second act are signalled by a wandering torch beam, for all the world like Tinkerbell in Peter Pan, and she takes poison just before Isolde launches into her Liebestod.

      "bodyText": "There's something about Herbert Wernicke's staging of Tristan und Isolde, the first of the Royal Opera's new productions this season, that reminds me irresistibly of hamsters. Breeding the rodents is a tricky business; they don't get on very well, and getting a pair to mate has to be approached carefully, bringing them together just for a few minutes to do the business and then separating them before they can kill each other. Wernicke treats these most famous of operatic lovers like that too: his set (he's done everything, including the lighting) consists of two colour-coded boxes - blue for the boy, blood red for the girl - and Tristan and Isolde are never allowed to leave these domains, as if close contact would cause them to tear each other limb from limb. Even in the second act the hamsters - sorry, the lovers - never approach within 10 yards of each other, never exchange glances; their boxes move suggestively together and the lighting becomes more elaborate as they get worked up, but that's about it. The director may be making the valid point that Tristan and Isolde's love is not only artificial (triggered by the love potion that Brangaene administers at the end of the first act), but also a self-centered emotion; that they are in love with the idea of being in love rather than with each other. But that is a very cerebral reading, and when it is combined with wooden acting from the two principals - their risible gestures should have gone out with Victorian melodrama - the result is desperately vapid. There are pitifully few other dramatic ideas: sailors in blazers and puttees greet King Marke's first appearance through megaphones and Tristan pulls himself on to Melot's sword at the end of Act 1; Brangaene's warnings in the second act are signalled by a wandering torch beam, for all the world like Tinkerbell in Peter Pan, and she takes poison just before Isolde launches into her Liebestod. It's not enough. The protagonists sound as if they are singing through megaphones. The Isolde, Gabriele Schnaut, seems incapable of anything less than fortissimo, and if the Tristan, Jon Frederic West, cannot quite match her volume he certainly equals the unpleasant acidity of her tone; they make an uningratiating couple. Even the Kurwenal, Alan Titus, barks rather than sings his lines; there was no chance of respite, so that at the end of the first act my ears were ringing as if I'd just sat through a Metallica concert.

      "body": "<p>England head for Pakistan a chastened side after Nairobi and their wretched performance against the South Africans in the quarter-final of the ICC Knockout Trophy - but heartened by yesterday's withdrawl of Shoaib Akhtar from the upcoming series. </p> <p>Akhtar, the 24-year-old paceman, was treated by specialists in Australia after being hampered by injury in recent seasons, and he will need to rest for at least a month before returning to full fitness. He misses all three Tests and the three one-day internationals. </p> <p>He said: 'I'm feeling pain in my shoulder but my knee and ankle are far better. It will take me another month to play at the highest level. I hope to play in England next year when Pakistan tour there and hope to play county cricket in 2002.' </p> <p>Akhtar or no Akhtar, England are playing against the big boys now. In the summer of 2000, they were able to overwhelm Zimbabwe and a West Indian team who are still in freefall, but when they came across a quality team they were found to be rusty and woefully inadequate. By the look on Nasser Hussain's face at the conclusion of the match in Nairobi, he would probably regard this as a charitable assessment. It won't be any easier in Pakistan. </p> <p>The defeat against South Africa was not unexpected but the ease with which England were overcome was mildly alarming. There were one or two tactical errors; it was an indulgence for Hussain to bat himself at three in that game, although I doubt whether this made any difference to the outcome. However, in the long term, Hussain's limitations in one-day cricket could become a problem. </p> <p>In the short term, Hussain has revealed how consuming the skipper's job has become. At the end of the domestic summer, he admits he was drained - despite the success against the West Indies: 'I was tired at the end of the season,' he says. 'The job is on my mind all the time. I'm constantly thinking about selection. I try to switch off but it's difficult especially in England because I'm surrounded by cricket. I find it easier abroad.' </p> <p>Pakistan, however, presents a real challenge to Hussain. England land there tomorrow in the knowledge that they have only ever won one Test match on Pakistan soil and that was almost 40 years ago. Ted Dexter's side won by five wickets in Lahore in October 1961 in the first of a three-match series, which was interrupted by a five-Test rubber in India. They have not threatened to win there since. Just before you decide that it might be more rewarding to support the national soccer side, perhaps we should also point out that England have only lost twice in Pakistan. On both occasions in 1984 and 1987 they were undone by the magical wrist spin of Abdul Qadir. The other 15 matches have all been drawn. </p> <p>There are several reasons for the high proportion of draws. The pitches have often been flat and grassless. Rain, mist and fog can sometimes intervene in Pakistan. Moreover, on the hastily-arranged 1968-69 tour, riots curtailed two of the matches; the only one that was not interrupted was in Dacca where there was no police or army presence and the student leaders controlled the crowds far more successfully. </p> <p>Colin Milburn, who had been playing in Western Australia, joined that party as a reinforcement. The Surrey off-spinner Pat Pocock was dispatched to the airport and mischievously arranged to take him straight to the grottiest resthouse he could find in Karachi as if this was England's Test base. Milburn was suitably aghast but not too dispirited since he went on to score his final century for England before losing an eye in a car crash in Northampton a few weeks later. In those days, food and accommodation could be a problem. Now the players will stay in international hotels almost indistinguishable from those in Sydney or Cape Town. This makes touring Pakistan more comfortable, but less of an adventure. </p> <p>There were no victories on the next two tours either, led by Tony Lewis in 1972-73 and Mike Brearley, whose broken arm allowed Geoff Boycott to take charge for the final Test in 1977-78. In that match in Karachi, I can't help noticing that Mike Gatting made his debut; in the first innings England suffered a world record of lbws (six), including Gatting, who was also leg before in the second innings. One of the umpires happened to be named Shakoor Rana, who was also in situ when England lost in Karachi in 1984. All of which seems of minor significance until we recall that memorable altercation in 1987 in Faisalabad as the second day of the Test was limping to a close. </p> <p>England have not played a Test match in Pakistan since that tour and inevitably, Shakoor Rana, who lives in Lahore, has been tracked down and it seems that the incident still represents the pinnacle of his career. 'How can I regret?' he told the Guardian last week. 'It made me the most famous umpire.' </p> <p>Given the 1987-88 tour and all the recent betting scandals this latest expedition may require a wee bit of diplomacy as well as cricketing resolve and patience. Despite the records, I would not bank on three draws in Pakistan this time. The nature of the Pakistan bowling attack has changed since England were last there - although Akhtar's absence will make a difference. They have always possessed capable spinners, but over the past decade they have had some of the most potent pace bowlers in the world (not just an Imran Khan in isolation). In fact, England's best chance of success will come if the wickets offer some assistance to the pacemen. Hussain's team would love to see a bit of grass and moisture in Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi since they have some confidence in their own pace attack, but it is a forlorn hope. </p> <p>None of the England players has ever played a Test in Pakistan, and they will have to overcome a trial by spin. The bowling of Saqlain Mushtaq and whoever is chosen to accompany him will be an ordeal for all the England batsmen. England counter with an unproven duo. Ashley Giles, provided he recovers fitness, has just one Test to his name and Ian Salisbury has so far faltered whenever he has been promoted to the Test arena. If England leave Karachi in December after another trio of draws, they will have not done too badly.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Just over three years ago, I walked into an office at Harrods for a meeting with Mohamed al-Fayed and Kevin Keegan, who told me: 'People may laugh at us but Fulham will be in the Premiership within five years.' </p> <p>That was in September 1997, when Fulham had just won promotion from the Third Division. Today, as leaders of the First Division with a 100 per cent League record, I have no doubt that they will be a Premiership club next season. </p> <p>Today Fulham are playing Blackburn - interesting because Fayed is aiming to emulate the rapid rise Rovers enjoyed from the lower half of the old Second Division to Premiership champions in the space of five years. </p> <p>Using Jack Walker's millions, Kenny Dalglish - like Keegan, a former Liverpool legend - had assembled a top-class side who became champions and were regulars in Europe when Fulham were floundering in the Third Division. </p> <p>I was at that meeting in Knightsbridge because I'd been recommended to them as the man to set up and run the youth academy at Fulham, and, coincidentally, I'd once turned down the chance to do a similar thing at Ewood Park. </p> <p>But what sold me on Fulham, quite apart from the fact that I grew up supporting them and have always had a soft spot for the club, was the absolute clarity of Fayed's vision. </p> <p>He had a five-year plan, along with Keegan, although it looks like Jean Tigana will carry it through to fruition. </p> <p>Barring a disastrous downturn in fortune, which I simply cannot envisage, Fulham will go up next May and, I believe, prosper in the Premiership. I do not, however, think they can go all the way and emulate Blackburn in winning the title, nor sustain a long-term challenge to the top-six elite because they will never be able to establish regular crowds of 50,000 or so. </p> <p>But they should be able to get 25,000 every week in the Premiership and comfortably compete with the likes of Leicester and West Ham. A big issue is whether they can redevelop their stadium to increase its capacity or have to move away from Craven Cottage, which would be a great shame when you consider its history and traditions. </p> <p>Fulham have always been a special club in many ways, but I would say they are now unique in the way they are organised. For a start, the HQ and power base is in Knightsbridge, SW3 rather than Craven Cottage. The club is run like a department of Harrods rather than a separate business and in this scheme of things, being manager of Fulham is barely different from running the food hall or menswear department. </p> <p>The staff and players have Harrods discount cards and are paid on Harrods payslips, and if you are considered to be doing a good job you are very well rewarded. </p> <p>But there is another side - and it can be ruthless. A good number of heads have rolled in the past three or four years. It is not just managers and players who have come and gone - the head of security and finance director were dismissed almost without warning. It is the sort of place where both on and off the field you have to perform ... or you will be out. </p> <p>When I arrived, Ray Wilkins was manager but he paid the price for failing to win promotion in his first season.

      "bodyText": "Just over three years ago, I walked into an office at Harrods for a meeting with Mohamed al-Fayed and Kevin Keegan, who told me: 'People may laugh at us but Fulham will be in the Premiership within five years.' That was in September 1997, when Fulham had just won promotion from the Third Division. Today, as leaders of the First Division with a 100 per cent League record, I have no doubt that they will be a Premiership club next season. Today Fulham are playing Blackburn - interesting because Fayed is aiming to emulate the rapid rise Rovers enjoyed from the lower half of the old Second Division to Premiership champions in the space of five years. Using Jack Walker's millions, Kenny Dalglish - like Keegan, a former Liverpool legend - had assembled a top-class side who became champions and were regulars in Europe when Fulham were floundering in the Third Division. I was at that meeting in Knightsbridge because I'd been recommended to them as the man to set up and run the youth academy at Fulham, and, coincidentally, I'd once turned down the chance to do a similar thing at Ewood Park. But what sold me on Fulham, quite apart from the fact that I grew up supporting them and have always had a soft spot for the club, was the absolute clarity of Fayed's vision. He had a five-year plan, along with Keegan, although it looks like Jean Tigana will carry it through to fruition. Barring a disastrous downturn in fortune, which I simply cannot envisage, Fulham will go up next May and, I believe, prosper in the Premiership. I do not, however, think they can go all the way and emulate Blackburn in winning the title, nor sustain a long-term challenge to the top-six elite because they will never be able to establish regular crowds of 50,000 or so. But they should be able to get 25,000 every week in the Premiership and comfortably compete with the likes of Leicester and West Ham. A big issue is whether they can redevelop their stadium to increase its capacity or have to move away from Craven Cottage, which would be a great shame when you consider its history and traditions. Fulham have always been a special club in many ways, but I would say they are now unique in the way they are organised. For a start, the HQ and power base is in Knightsbridge, SW3 rather than Craven Cottage. The club is run like a department of Harrods rather than a separate business and in this scheme of things, being manager of Fulham is barely different from running the food hall or menswear department. The staff and players have Harrods discount cards and are paid on Harrods payslips, and if you are considered to be doing a good job you are very well rewarded. But there is another side - and it can be ruthless. A good number of heads have rolled in the past three or four years. It is not just managers and players who have come and gone - the head of security and finance director were dismissed almost without warning. It is the sort of place where both on and off the field you have to perform ... or you will be out. When I arrived, Ray Wilkins was manager but he paid the price for failing to win promotion in his first season. Kevin Keegan got Fulham into the First Division but then left for England, and Paul Bracewell did not last a season. I do think, however, it was an excellent idea to make Tigana's appointment before the end of the season so he had those final seven games - when I was in charge along with Karlheinz Riedle and Roy Evans - to see what he needed to do. He came along in the summer with his own ideas and staff, and has been fantastic - perhaps the best signing Fulham have made. Certainly I can never remember a stronger or more consistent side than this one, where they have, in each area, the best players by far in the division, in Maik Taylor, Chris Coleman, John Collins and Louis Saha. Tigana has an excellent knowledge of French football from his time as a coach and an agent there, and he has two other excellent young Frenchmen in Fabrice Fernandes and Nicholas Sahoun. But he has also been as good as his word in blooding youngsters who have come through the academy and is very keen to build for the future with homegrown talent too. Tigana already has seven or eight players who can thrive in the Premiership, and will have no problem recruiting another four or five when they go up. He has the resources to do that without having to sell - indeed this year's reserves are almost the same as last year's first team. Tigana also has the cachet to attract very good players to the club, just as Keegan did. Whenever I spent time in Europe for Fulham, people who had never previously heard of the club knew about them because of the manager. Keegan understood the importance of marketing, and that is another reason why Fulham stand out - their marketing philosophy is the same as Harrods', and indeed a lot of club merchandise is on sale there. But I do wonder what would happen if Fayed left for any reason. Walker left a lot of money in trust funds so that Blackburn will remain wealthy for years to come. I don't know if that would be the case at Fulham. I'm more concerned that my Crystal Palace team are playing them this week. They are a frightening prospect for any club, and I suspect could give a few Premiership teams a run for their money.

The feeling grew in the second half when Hendrie shot lamely across goal after Julian Joachim had slipped him through and Tay lor missed his kick on the six-yard line. </p> <p>And so it happened. Pires pushed the ball forward to Henry in the inside-right channel and he swivelled to send a low shot through Alpay's legs and into James's far corner.

'It's not the easiest period for us, but we will have to try and overcome these little problems. Actually, they're big problems!' </p> <p>They would have been one point bigger had it not been for an inexplicable foul from behind by Kevin Davies on Alex Nyarko that presented Michael Ball with an 80th-minute penalty equaliser. </p> <p>That cancelled out the one moment of rare quality in an appalling game, five minutes earlier, when Southampton full-back Jason Dodd opened the scoring with a tremendous 25-yard volley after Steve Watson's headed clearance had fallen to him. </p> <p>The goal capped a workmanlike, if uninspired, South-ampton performance with a lone striker, Marian Pahars, operating with Hassan Kachloul and Davies making supporting runs from deep. Had defender Tahar El Khalej succeeded with a header that struck the bar in the dying seconds of the first half, the remainder of the game may have been transformed. </p> <p>Instead, the second period followed the same monotonous pattern. Mis-hit passes, poor use of the ball by Everton, the occasional South-ampton counter-attack that all too often led to nothing. </p> <p>The most promising, in the 58th minute, required Paul Gerrard to sprint off his line and beat Pahars to a superbly judged Kachloul through-ball. </p> <p>'It's that cutting edge that's missing,' said manager Glenn Hoddle. 'But sometimes that's a \u00a310 million player you're talking about and we don't have those resources at the moment. </p> <p>'We're improving as a team, coming away and dominating games like this.

      "bodyText": "A game that did nothing to support the Premiership propagandists who would have us believe this is the world's best domestic product did, however, add to Everton's growing problems. One victory in eight league and cup games, including the embarrassing Worthington Cup exit to Bristol Rovers, allied with seven potential starters on the treatment table, have Everton casting a glance at the relegation places with a degree of mild concern. 'We could certainly do with a win,' said manager Walter Smith. 'It's not the easiest period for us, but we will have to try and overcome these little problems. Actually, they're big problems!' They would have been one point bigger had it not been for an inexplicable foul from behind by Kevin Davies on Alex Nyarko that presented Michael Ball with an 80th-minute penalty equaliser. That cancelled out the one moment of rare quality in an appalling game, five minutes earlier, when Southampton full-back Jason Dodd opened the scoring with a tremendous 25-yard volley after Steve Watson's headed clearance had fallen to him. The goal capped a workmanlike, if uninspired, South-ampton performance with a lone striker, Marian Pahars, operating with Hassan Kachloul and Davies making supporting runs from deep. Had defender Tahar El Khalej succeeded with a header that struck the bar in the dying seconds of the first half, the remainder of the game may have been transformed. Instead, the second period followed the same monotonous pattern. Mis-hit passes, poor use of the ball by Everton, the occasional South-ampton counter-attack that all too often led to nothing. The most promising, in the 58th minute, required Paul Gerrard to sprint off his line and beat Pahars to a superbly judged Kachloul through-ball. 'It's that cutting edge that's missing,' said manager Glenn Hoddle. 'But sometimes that's a \u00a310 million player you're talking about and we don't have those resources at the moment. 'We're improving as a team, coming away and dominating games like this. But with the way we're playing we should be picking up more points.'",

Even more so when, within seconds of the restart, Peter Beagrie's cross found Ashley Ward six yards from goal but, with the away fans already celebrating, his header bounced wide. </p> <p>'If that goes in it gives you half a chance to get back in the game,' said the Bradford manager, Chris Hutchings. But it wasn't the worst of Bradford's misses. 'We probably had about five headers but the keeper never had to make a save.' </p> <p>The worst miss came courtesy of Dean Windass, who raced into the area to meet Benito Carbone's cross only to miscue his header wide. 'If there's anyone in the club you want coming in on a cross, it's Windass,' said Hutchings, 'but he scuffed it.' </p> <p>The home side also missed chances, but they could afford to. 'We've had chances in all the games we've played,' said Hutchings, 'We've just got to keep plugging away, and hopefully we can turn the tide.' For now, though, Bradford look all at sea.</p>",

Sky's morning news headlines two days before the match led the portents: 'Trouble in Middle East' (image of violence in Palestine); 'Scientists say they can revive dinosaurs' (image of dinosaur); 'Wilkinson to lead England in Helsinki' (image of dinosaur). A day before kick-off Fins began unfurling banners like the one above as fans made their own entertainment. Adam Crozier revealed his vision of a brighter future for England by leading the attack as England's press team beat the Fins 3-1 thanks to goals from a three-man, all Scottish strikeforce. So when the 0-0 happened, no-one minded too much. The trip's most diverting off-field incident came at the end, though, in Wilkinson's putting-things-in-perspective post-game post-mortem. 'I tried to give them a shape and a plan,' he explained. 'But God got seven days, I got three.' </p> <p> <strong> World news</strong> </p> <p>BRAZIL: Brazilian league referees have been equipped with new high-tech aerosol sprays to mark the distance between ball and wall at free-kicks. New this season in all official matches, the dye evaporates from the grass within 60 seconds, but makes spotting encroachments easier. If the device works, the Brazilian FA hope Fifa will approve the scheme worldwide. </p> <p>NIGERIA: Kwara United fans have mounted a fierce prayer-led attack on the referees they say brought about their relegation last season. 'Lord humiliate them,' chanted 250 last week. 'Lord punish those who punish us and Lord shame those who put us to shame.' The prayers followed days of riots during the Pepsi Professional League season, seven days of fasting and attacks on adminsitrators homes. A fans spokesman explained they would only stop when they saw 'divine wrath' inflicted on all officials. </p> <p>PERU: Official reports that Newcastle's Nolberto Solano was stripped of the Peruvian captaincy after a poor performance in the recent defeat by Bolivia don't square with reports from Lima. According to the Peruvian press, Solano was in fact demoted for playing a prominent part in smuggling 'many drunken women' into the squad's training camp for pre-match 'entertainment'. 'The press are following me everywhere,' Solano said. 'I'm persecuted.' </p> <p> <strong> Competition winners</strong> </p> <p>Last week's winners: 54,075 surfers visited euro200.org instead of Sportal's euro2000.org website during the summer - Julie McCarthy of Hackney, London, wins two tickets for AC Milan v Juventus, including flights and hotels. The \u00a33,000 tickets for the AXA final ball Wembley showpiece on 2 November were won by Carl Leppard of Eastbourne - the White Horse Cup final horse was called Billie, not Alf. Tickets for the event are available on 020 8947 1881. </p> <p><strong> Tales from the Tabs</strong> </p> <p>PHILLIPS WANTS OUT: England reject Kevin Phillips has sparked a massive \u00a315m transfer scramble by revealing he wants to swap Sunderland for a bigger club in an effort to win caps. 'Deep down, you have to start thinking it's your club, not your form that's the problem,' says the striker. 'I love Sunderland, but I feel like an England outcast.' </p> <p>VIALLI: I'M STAYING Gianluca Vialli is ready to return to Premiership management after missing out on a move to Inter Milan last week - but only if the job's in London. 'I love the city,' says Vialli. 'There's no reason for me to move away just because I'm not at Chelsea anymore. Managing a top club is very stressful, I do miss it.'</p> <p>GIGGS PAY HITS \u00a312m Ryan Giggs' new four-year Manchester United contract is set to earn him \u00a312m - \u00a352,000 a week plus a \u00a31m testimonial - after agents upped the pressure on Old Trafford bosses. 'I think it'll all be agreed fairly soon,' says Giggs, 'hopefully by Christmas.'

Adam Crozier revealed his vision of a brighter future for England by leading the attack as England's press team beat the Fins 3-1 thanks to goals from a three-man, all Scottish strikeforce. So when the 0-0 happened, no-one minded too much. The trip's most diverting off-field incident came at the end, though, in Wilkinson's putting-things-in-perspective post-game post-mortem. 'I tried to give them a shape and a plan,' he explained. 'But God got seven days, I got three.' World news BRAZIL: Brazilian league referees have been equipped with new high-tech aerosol sprays to mark the distance between ball and wall at free-kicks. New this season in all official matches, the dye evaporates from the grass within 60 seconds, but makes spotting encroachments easier. If the device works, the Brazilian FA hope Fifa will approve the scheme worldwide. NIGERIA: Kwara United fans have mounted a fierce prayer-led attack on the referees they say brought about their relegation last season. 'Lord humiliate them,' chanted 250 last week. 'Lord punish those who punish us and Lord shame those who put us to shame.' The prayers followed days of riots during the Pepsi Professional League season, seven days of fasting and attacks on adminsitrators homes. A fans spokesman explained they would only stop when they saw 'divine wrath' inflicted on all officials. PERU: Official reports that Newcastle's Nolberto Solano was stripped of the Peruvian captaincy after a poor performance in the recent defeat by Bolivia don't square with reports from Lima. According to the Peruvian press, Solano was in fact demoted for playing a prominent part in smuggling 'many drunken women' into the squad's training camp for pre-match 'entertainment'. 'The press are following me everywhere,' Solano said. 'I'm persecuted.'

Tales from the Tabs PHILLIPS WANTS OUT: England reject Kevin Phillips has sparked a massive \u00a315m transfer scramble by revealing he wants to swap Sunderland for a bigger club in an effort to win caps. 'Deep down, you have to start thinking it's your club, not your form that's the problem,' says the striker. 'I love Sunderland, but I feel like an England outcast.' VIALLI: I'M STAYING Gianluca Vialli is ready to return to Premiership management after missing out on a move to Inter Milan last week - but only if the job's in London. 'I love the city,' says Vialli. 'There's no reason for me to move away just because I'm not at Chelsea anymore. Managing a top club is very stressful, I do miss it.'

Not only did the goals from Andrei Kanchelskis and Giovanni van Bronckhorst expose Galatasaray's previously unsuspected nervousness, but they had other scoring opportunities during those frantic closing minutes. </p> <p>But closer scrutiny of the circumstances in which the Scottish champions rattled the home side tends to reveal that the form is not entirely trustworthy. </p> <p>Galatasaray started that game without four first picks, the Brazilian defender Capone and the three most influential midfielders in the side, Gheorghe Hagi, Buruk Okan and Kaya Suat were missing because of a combination of illness, injury and suspension. </p> <p>In addition, the outstanding player on the field, Emre Belozoglu, had to leave because of ankle damage just two minutes after Rangers had scored their first goal. Emre had virtually controlled the game single-handed, an impression confirmed by Advocaat on Friday, when he agreed that his departure had caused virtual disintegration among the Turks. </p> <p>'He was the best player, all right,' said the Rangers manager. 'We had our own Turk, Tugay, marking him, but Tugay never got near him. It was no coincidence that we came more into the game after Emre left.' </p> <p>At that point, Galatasaray were effectively without five of their best players. Four of them are expected to be in Glasgow this week - Emre is said to be still unavailable because of his injury - and it was no surprise to hear their coach, Mircea Lucescu, offer a rather chilling observation at the Ali Sami Yen Stadium a few minutes after he had concluded the official press conference. </p> <p>Standing in a corner of the media room, Lucescu, who had been extremely personable when talking to the assembled corps - answering questions from the locals in French through an inter preter and switching to polite English for the benefit of the visiting journalists - became very serious when it was suggested that he would have a much stronger team for the visit to Scotland. 'Oh, yes,' said the Romanian, 'Rangers should be very scared of us in Glasgow.' </p> <p>It would be an exaggeration to claim that Advocaat and his players will be cowering at the mention of Lucescu's warning, but the little Dutchman is realistic enough to know that a reversal of fortunes will be no formality. Especially as Rangers themselves will be without seven players who could have been called probable starters. </p> <p>Lorenzo Amoruso, the central defender and captain, is suspended and the others - fellow central defender Craig Moore, full-backs Arthur Numan and Fernando Ricksen and forwards Michael Mols, Rod Wallace and Neil McCann - are incapacitated by injury. The goalkeeper, Stefan Klos, is no certain runner, troubled by ankle damage that has required painkilling injections to allow him to play for the past five weeks. His deputy, Lionel Charbonnier, is also unavailable, and Rangers could yet be forced to field the inexperienced 19-year-old, Mark Brown. </p> <p>Advocaat, mustering all of his force ful self-belief, almost bridled at the suggestion that he was in charge of a weakened team, perhaps an attempt to stoke the confidence of the likely stand-ins, strip them of any possible apprehension. </p> <p>'If you're a member of Rangers' squad,' he said, 'you have to be a good player, able to do the job. They've done it in the past, so I'm not concerned about the players who are likely to come in.

The Rangers coach emphasises they play with an extra man in the middle to accommodate the luxury known as Gheorghe Hagi. </p> <p>'He is 35 and still one of the best players in the world with the ball,' said Advocaat of the celebrated Romanian. 'Without it, he is not too interested in defending. That's why they have that extra man. Yes, it will be difficult to break them down, but we will get chances in the match, that is for sure.

Perhaps the only surprise was that the player who did most of the damage to the QPR defence was a defender, Neil Cox. The full-back, not known for his scoring prowess, scored their first two goals. Although Karl Ready replied to give the visitors a glimmer of hope, Gifton Noel-Williams made it 3-1. </p> <p>As Watford manager Graham Taylor pointed out: 'Our lead might only last for 24 hours, but you cannot dismiss the sort of start we have had.' </p> <p>QPR's manager, Gerry Francis, did not disagree. At the same time, though, he suggested that Watford had been fortunate that QPR's striker Chris Kiwomya had not been fit to play. He explained: 'The Watford defence can be upset, as we saw today, and I think his pace would have caused them problems.' </p> <p>The other leading teams to collect maximum points were Bolton, Birmingham and Pre ston. Birmingham recovered from a penalty miss by their captain, Martin O'Connor, and Crystal Palace taking the lead through Andy Morrison, to win 2-1. Their goals came from substitutes Mark Burchill and Dele Adebola. </p> <p>Preston owed their 1-0 win over Tranmere to a Steve Basham goal. But the afternoon ended in misery for Basham, who suffered a broken leg in a 50-50 challenge with Jason Koumas. </p> <p>At the other end, Sheffield Wednesday slumped to their seventh successive league defeat in going down 2-1 at Portsmouth. It was quite a day for Steve Claridge, who marked his first match as Portsmouth's player-manager by playing a big part in their first goal from Thomas Thorgersen, and grabbing the other. </p> <p>Wednesday's manager, Paul Jewell, said: 'We are lacking in confidence at the moment and it showed today. The one thing I was pleased about was that the players did not succumb to a heavier defeat after going 2-0 down.' </p> <p>The most exciting match was unquestionably the eight-goal thriller at Wimbledon, where the home team twice came from behind to lead 4-3 but eventually had to settle for a draw through a Carl Asaba goal. </p> <p>Another contest to satisfy goal gluttons was Nottingham Forest's 4-3 win at Barnsley. The fact that two of Forest's goals came from their captain, Chris Bart-Williams, must have been bad news for Forest's first-team coach, Steve Wigley. According to Bart-Williams, Wigley has promised him a new shirt from Harrods every time he scores and Forest go on to win. </p> <p>As a former striker, Millwall's new manager, Mark McGhee, says that he is particularly excited about working with the club's 23-year-old centre-forward, Neil Harris. </p> <p>'What I like about him is his movement, his ability with the ball at his feet and his back to the goal,' he explains. 'If I'd had him with me at Wolves in the season that we finished third in the First Division, we would have won the title. He is a cut above the other strikers in this division.' Harris was the star of Millwall's match at home to Bury, scoring two of the goals in their 4-0 win. </p> <p>Another scorer in the spotlight was Notts County's Andy Hughes in the 2-2 draw against Wigan.

Prior to this game Leicester had conceded only two goals all season, though 34-year-old Sheringham could easily have had a hat-trick, shooting over in the second half and going close with a header from a corner before coming off after 70 minutes. The player so mystifyingly withdrawn in Helsinki also played his usual supporting role, most notably in setting up Dwight Yorke for a shot which brought the save of the game from Tim Flowers. 'He's having a great season,' Sir Alex Ferguson said. 'I only brought him off because he has a slight calf strain and I want him for PSV on Wednesday' </p> <p>Considering Ole Gunnar Solskjaer added a third in stoppage time, City must have been glad they were playing only half the champions. Andy Cole, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs were rested, but the player United missed most was the injured David Beckham. Suddenly the visitors needed two or three passes to transfer the ball across the pitch instead of just the one, and too many failed to find intended targets. </p> <p>The home side were guilty of the same offence in a scrappy and forgettable first half-hour, and would ordinarily have been punished. But when Matt Elliott leant on Quinton Fortune to give away a free-kick on the edge of the penalty area, there was no Beckham to bend a shot over the wall and consequently little danger. Leicester did better with one of their own midway through the half, when Neil Lennon's free-kick found Gary Rowett at the far post. But he missed from close range with a side-foot volley. </p> <p>That was as close as Leicester came before half-time, by which stage they were grateful to be just one goal down. Their defensive concentration wavered in the 36th minute when Sheringham rose in front of Rowett to glance in Denis Irwin's cross for the breakthrough, then three minutes later Solskjaer supplied a low centre which Fortune was only inches from turning in. </p> <p>Leicester had a couple of chances to equalise right at the start of the second half, but Rowett hit the side netting and Darren Eadie's weakly-hit effort was smothered by Fabien Barthez. Leicester had to chase the game and they were hit by a classic United counter-attack. Leicester claimed a penalty when Wes Brown and Robbie Savage went for the same ball, but though the United player made contact with the man, he could not possibly have predicted Savage's arrival and Paul Durkin's corner verdict was probably correct. Predictably Leicester sent Elliott and Co forward, only to be caught when Fortune raced 60 yards almost unchallenged to supply Roy Keane. His first effort was blocked, but he found Irwin, and Sheringham pounced again when Tim Flowers failed to hold the Irishman's thunderous drive. </p> <p>Giggs came on for the last 20 minutes, in time to see Flowers fingertip a Solskjaer header over the bar and Nicky Butt hit a post, though Leicester refused to give up and could have had something out of the game with better finishing in the final minutes. Savage shot wide when Barthez was caught out of his ground, but when Richard Cresswell rounded the goalkeeper from Lennon's defence-splitting pass in the 81st minute, there was less excuse for the substitute missing an empty net. </p> <p>There was very little chance of Solskjaer missing when Yorke gave him an opportunity in the closing seconds. Leicester will need to get sharper if they are really going to challenge for honours, especially as they don't have Beckham, Cole and Scholes to come back. </p> <p>'I was criticised for my last selection against PSV, and it would have been the same had we lost here,' Ferguson said.

      "body": "<p> It's a hot autumn day in the North End of Boston, and a group of us are loitering sheepishly on the narrow pavement while Michele Topor dives into a greengrocer's. The shop is too small for us to follow her, so she bobs back outside waving a pair of aubergines - which she proceeds to sex for us. The one with the line mark opposite the stem is female; the one with a dot is male. The male of the species is superior, she explains: it's less bitter. </p> <p>It's one of many new things I learned during Topor's three-hour culinary tour. A passionate guide, she marched us in and out of specialist stores, introducing chefs, shopkeepers and characters while producing a continuous stream of recipes and anecdotes. The North End is Boston's oldest neighbourhood, dating back to 1630 when the first English Puritans settled. A first stop for many European immigrants, it became Jewish, then Irish. By 1910, however, the area was 90 per cent Italian - which is how it stayed until recently, when developers began turning run-down buildings into luxury flats and young professionals began making their homes here. More change looms as harbourside redevelopment marches on. </p> <p>But the shops are still defiantly small, local and Italian. You can still buy fresh-filled cannoli (a Sicilian dessert) at Maria's Bakery on Cross Street and sticks of liquorice root in Polcari's Coffee on Salem Street - a shop opened in 1932, which is probably also when it was last decorated. Almost everywhere we visited produced something for us to try - delicious pumpkin fudge, cheeses, biscuits, marzipan, balsamic vinegar, slivers of ham. </p> <p>Across the Charles River in Cambridge, the shops and caf\u00e9s clustered around Harvard Square give a taste of what may be to come for the North End. Over a huge breakfast at Henrietta's Table in the Charles Hotel, the restaurant's director Tom Daley says that many locals are unhappy with the way the area is changing. The university owns most of the property, and many leases came up for renewal at the start of this year. Rents went up and some of the oldest retailers moved out, letting the big chain stores in. For now most of the shops are still small and funky, with pricey but interesting clothes and shoe shops as well as the highest concentration of bookshops in the world. </p> <p> Proof that not all change need be bad can be found back across the river in the Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall area, where 10 million tourists shop every year. It was redeveloped in the 1970s at the same time as London's Covent Garden, with much the same aim: to reinvent the grand buildings of the main produce market. A food court now runs down the centre of Quincy Market selling seafood and every kind of ethnic cuisine imaginable: a great place for a pit-stop on the retail trail. The stalls of the North Market are a great source of unusual toys and trinkets. </p> <p>Across town, Newbury Street is Boston's equivalent to the King's Road. Posh designer stores are clustered at one end by the Public Gardens, and the shops on this long tree-lined street get smaller and more innovative as it heads west. It's a great place for people-watching and at Christmas the lights make it a magical walk, but this street, too, is losing its capacity to surprise. </p> <p>It seems like only yesterday (1992 in fact) when I walked into a Starbucks, ordered a frappuccino and thought it was the coolest caffeine hit I'd ever experienced. Now you can get this frozen coffee confection on almost any UK high street, in a Starbucks with the same pictures on the walls as in Boston. Sunglasses Hut, Baby Gap, Niketown and Foot Locker have similarly lost their power to thrill the visitor. </p> <p>Those determined to hunt out bargains will have to make a 40-minute car ride or a $33 return coach trip out of town to the Wrentham Village premium outlet mall, where 130 designer stores sell at discount prices. For those in love with their logos, there were bargains galore. But wandering round this vast place, something strange happened. I lost the will to shop. I sat on a bench watching bag-laden consumers shuffling through the centre as if drugged. It was a clear, sunny autumn day in New England. If I'd hired a car that morning, I could have been gazing out to sea on Cape Cod. That afternoon I gave my credit card a rest and explored some sites on the Freedom Trail and Black Heritage Trail, two enjoyable, well-marked walks which reflect both Boston's human, walkable scale and its place in American history. To miss that in order to buy a cheaper Gap T-shirt seemed criminal.</p> <p><strong>Birth of a nation: Historic landmarks </strong></p> <p><strong> Plimoth Plantation </strong><br> In 1620 a group of religious dissenters called the Pilgrims sailed from Plymouth on The Mayflower to start a new life. They landed at Cape Cod, finally settling in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and founding the first British colony. There is a recreation of the settlement at Plimoth Plantation.</p> <p><strong> Boston Tea Party </strong><br> In protest against crippling taxes by the British government, colonists emptied the cargo of three tea ships into Boston Harbour in 1773, igniting the revolution. The Boston Tea Party Ship and Museum tell the story.</p> <p><strong> Declaration of Independence </strong><br> Colonial leaders met in Philadelphia to sign the Declaration of Independence on 4 July 1776, leading to the Revolutionary War.

      "body": "<p> Leaving Boston's inner harbour, you get a fine view of the Custom House clock tower, its oldest skyscraper. A pair of endangered peregrine falcons have made their home on its peak, a fitting symbol of the way America's oldest city has blended its modernity with New England's natural beauty. </p> <p>It was one of many sights pointed out in a breezy, informative commentary as our whale-watching boat left on its hour-long journey to Stellwagen Bank, a shallow, plankton-rich area of water that provides a feeding ground for so much marine life it's been made a nature sanctuary. It is home to both humpback and minke whales, and sightings are guaranteed from April to November. Then the animals show their intelligence by migrating to the Caribbean for winter. </p> <p>As we neared the bank, our guide's commentary was interrupted by two large, black shapes rising out of the sea surprisingly close to the boat. They were humpbacks. When one dived giving a clear view of the distinctive markings on the underside of its tail, our guide identified her as a female known as Tornado, accompanied by her young calf. The pair went into a deep dive leaving a 'whale footprint' - a still, glassy circle on the choppy sea. The boat moved on, heading for one of the many sets of breathing spouts we could see on the horizon. (The spout is not, as I'd assumed, sea water. It is condensation made as the whale exhales, its warm breath showing in the air as our own does on a cold day.) </p> <p>As the whales dived and resurfaced around us, our guide explained what we were seeing: from spectacular tail-flips and kicks on the surface perhaps to get rid of barnacles and parasites, to feeding activity and dives both shallow and deep. What struck me most was the apparent indifference these mighty animals had to human activity: great for those of us wanting to see them, but no so good for the whales themselves - even in these protected waters they are often fatally injured in tangles with trawlers' fishing nets. </p> <p>As we moved away, our guide said it had been one of the best sightings for weeks. But up on the surface, you never get a real sense of these huge sea mammals. Just a tiny, humbling and exhilarating glimpse into an existence completely apart from our own.</p> <p>\u0095 New England Aquarium Whale Watches cost $26.50 for adults, $19 for youths (12-18) and $16.50 for children (up to 11). For reservations call 00 1 617 973 5281. They run every weekend until November 5, and begin again in April next year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leaving Boston's inner harbour, you get a fine view of the Custom House clock tower, its oldest skyscraper. A pair of endangered peregrine falcons have made their home on its peak, a fitting symbol of the way America's oldest city has blended its modernity with New England's natural beauty. It was one of many sights pointed out in a breezy, informative commentary as our whale-watching boat left on its hour-long journey to Stellwagen Bank, a shallow, plankton-rich area of water that provides a feeding ground for so much marine life it's been made a nature sanctuary. It is home to both humpback and minke whales, and sightings are guaranteed from April to November. Then the animals show their intelligence by migrating to the Caribbean for winter. As we neared the bank, our guide's commentary was interrupted by two large, black shapes rising out of the sea surprisingly close to the boat. They were humpbacks. When one dived giving a clear view of the distinctive markings on the underside of its tail, our guide identified her as a female known as Tornado, accompanied by her young calf. The pair went into a deep dive leaving a 'whale footprint' - a still, glassy circle on the choppy sea. The boat moved on, heading for one of the many sets of breathing spouts we could see on the horizon. (The spout is not, as I'd assumed, sea water. It is condensation made as the whale exhales, its warm breath showing in the air as our own does on a cold day.) As the whales dived and resurfaced around us, our guide explained what we were seeing: from spectacular tail-flips and kicks on the surface perhaps to get rid of barnacles and parasites, to feeding activity and dives both shallow and deep. What struck me most was the apparent indifference these mighty animals had to human activity: great for those of us wanting to see them, but no so good for the whales themselves - even in these protected waters they are often fatally injured in tangles with trawlers' fishing nets. As we moved away, our guide said it had been one of the best sightings for weeks. But up on the surface, you never get a real sense of these huge sea mammals. Just a tiny, humbling and exhilarating glimpse into an existence completely apart from our own. \u0095 New England Aquarium Whale Watches cost $26.50 for adults, $19 for youths (12-18) and $16.50 for children (up to 11). For reservations call 00 1 617 973 5281. They run every weekend until November 5, and begin again in April next year.",

'You would have to be an idiot not to believe it is now a very different game.'</p> <p>At 12.18pm last Wednesday, the moment Dewar was pronounced dead, the whole of the UK, not only Scotland, entered uncharted and perilous constitutional waters.

Open conflict between Holyrood and Westminster has been almost non-existent. But with Dewar's passing, the realities of dividing power between two different parliaments will quickly become apparent.</p> <p>For whoever takes over from Dewar will immediately be confronted with the unenviable task of moving the Parliament out from beneath the late First Minister's shadow. To do so, they will almost certainly have to adopt a more nationalistic agenda.</p> <p>According to recent polls, fewer than one in four Scots want independence, while more than half support devolution. But at the same time, the SNP has established a fairly solid lead over Labour when it comes to Holyrood voting intentions. The implication is clear: voters might not want to break up the UK but they want a Scottish Executive ready to rough it up with Downing Street.</p> <p>'The idea that the British state has ever been homogeneous is flawed, but never more so than now,' said James Mitchell, professor of politics at Strathclyde University. 'The real test of devolution was always going to come post-Dewar, and we are now moving into a much more realistic phase for the Scottish Parliament.</p> <p>'Without Dewar, it is going to have to stand up, establish itself and work.'</p> <p>So McLeish or McConnell will have to be prepared to break away from the path dictated by London party policy, a task that may come more naturally to McConnell. He was a founder of the Scottish Labour Action group in the 1980s and represented Labour on the Constitutional Convention. McLeish, by contrast, was a Westminster MP for 13 years, during which time he served as a UK Minister. But even he will want to start thumping a more overtly Scottish tub if he wins. One minefield the new First Minister will almost certainly have to cross involves the question of greater powers for Holyrood, in particular over raising its own finances.</p> <p>More importantly, Dewar's successor will have to be seen to secure a few victories against London. And that may create further problems for Labour in Scotland. There are fears in some quarters that neither man has the stature to take on Downing Street over a major issue of policy and win. 'The relationship between London and Edinburgh is going to be much more fluid,' said Mitchell. 'Dewar was somebody who could go to Blair, if not as an equal, then damn near it, and the loss of somebody who was such a big player on the British field is going to have a serious effect. Dewar was able to smooth things over, and none of the potential candidates is going to be able to do that.'</p> <p>Some leading Labour MSPs agree. One told The Observer : 'Downing Street will be concerned because Tony Blair knew Donald well and so did Gordon Brown. Whatever relationship they have with whoever takes over will not be the same.'</p> <p>All this will make life difficult for Downing Street. The movement of power away from London fits in with Blair's philosophical support for decentralisation. But it runs counter to his centralising instincts that the 'only way to get things done' is for him and his staff to get involved. He has had to learn, from the debacle of Ken Livingstone's successful campaign to be Mayor of London to the mess over Alun Michael in Wales, that devolving power means losing power.</p> <p>In an interview with The Observer in the spring, he admitted that he had to learn to let go.</p> <p>That decision will be tested now. Much like Margaret Thatcher, Blair has never really 'got' Scotland. He left it to the likes of Dewar, one of the few people he felt politically in awe of. Now he no longer has that luxury. 'The best way to describe it is that devolution is a big juggernaut Blair could live with so long as Donald was driving,' said a senior Scottish Labour MP. 'He knew its path would be predictable and it would only really have one gear. But now the fear is the juggernaut will run out of control.'</p> <p>A senior Labour Party figure with close connections to Downing Street said Blair was 'totally relaxed' about leaving the decision to Scotland.

In the next few months, Scotland and the rest of the UK will find out how deep that change will run.",

Alan Clark has been lunching with Frank Johnson, then, and now again, a parliamentary sketch writer. Johnson seems to be less interested in talking about the Conservative Party than in Clark's views about the Nazis. 'Yes, I told him, I was a Nazi; I really believed it to be the ideal system, and that it was a disaster for the Anglo-Saxon races and for the world that it was extinguished.' Johnson, by Clark's account, gulps and grins and suggests he can't really mean it. </p> <p>'Oh yes, I told him, I was completely committed to the whole philosophy. The blood and violence was an essential ingredient of its strength, the heroic tradition of cruelty every bit as powerful and a thousand times more ancient than the Judaeo-Christian ethic.' Johnson persists in disbelieving Clark. And what does he confide to his diary? That it was, indeed, a bit of a joke? No. He complains that Johnson and others take 'refuge in the convention that Alan-doesn't-really-mean-it. He-only-says-it-to-shock, etc. Frank said that people simply will not allow the reality that a \"toff\" could be serious about these views...'</p> <p>Alan doesn't really mean it. There is the nub of the problem. At some level, he clearly did mean it and this selection of his earlier diaries, running from 1972-1982 when his famous Diaries begins, makes Clark's fascist views very clear. On several occasions, he toys with the idea of defecting to the National Front. Two NF members come to his constituency surgery; he chats to them and muses: 'How good they were, and how brave is the minority, in a once great country who keep alive the tribal essence.' </p> <p>The NF won't stand against him, he reassures his Tory Plymouth officials 'because they know I'm the nearest thing they're likely to get to an MP'. He frequently compares his personal situation with Hitler's, recording, for instance, in 1976: 'Obsessed with the fall of the Reich. This is 1944, one year left.' He fantasises about being called to lead the country at a moment of collapse. </p> <p>So what are we to make of it all? Was Alan Clark sinister, despite his brilliant prose talent and his irresistible wit? For those who never knew him, the best clue comes in a passage from 1979, when he is intriguing to become a Tory whip which, he concedes, would be 'second best from the original concept of galloping across the countryside on a white horse, drawn sword in hand, rousing the populace - but I would settle for it'. </p> <p>Yes, it is Mr Pooter. If he can't be a darkly handsome Nazi leader, he would settle for the Conservative whips' office. In the end, Alan Clark and his diaries are engaging and tolerable because we will not, cannot, grant him the thing he most wants from his audience - we cannot take him seriously. </p> <p>This is Pooter with a castle, a collection of cars straight from Toad's garage, a ferocious sexual urge and a deep strain of hypochondria. We laugh with him, some of the time, but more often we laugh at him. He came to realise it, which must have been almost intolerable. For all the swagger and swish, the style and the curled lip, he was a comic figure and knew it. </p> <p>The comedy, as with other comic diarists, depends heavily on the repetition of key themes. He is constantly giving up backgammon and just as constantly, a few days later, losing yet more money at it. He is always on the sexual prowl, generally unsuccessfully, and finds the oddest things provoke his turbulent libido. </p> <p>To my eye, one of the least explicable, funniest moments comes during an assessment of his bodily decay ('eyes puffy' etc): 'A bit stiff, can get quite unpleasant twinges from shoulder if, eg, turning round while holding up phone.' And then, apropos of nothing: 'Being 51 makes me feel quite lecherous.' What? Run that past us again? </p> <p>Similarly, below the show-off remarks, his politics are simply incoherent. He is pro-Nazi but also proud of the 'Spitfire summer'. He is violently anti-European but entranced by that original Europeanist, Harold Macmillan. He is utterly committed to Margaret Thatcher and the Tory right wing except when he is buttering up her sworn Cabinet enemy and leading 'wet', Francis Pym, telling him he'll be Prime Minister in two years if he resigns and takes her on. Does this seem just a little odd, even to him? It does. </p> <p>'What a rich, endlessly varied and exciting world politics is for those who are addicted to it,' he gushes. 'And how inextricably woven are the different strands of greed, ambition, cowardice and idealism. No one's motives are pure; certainly not mine.' Yes, it's that man again - Mr Pooter goes to Parliament. </p> <p>Perhaps it is impossible to be a great diarist without being enough of a fool to play Everyman at his weakest moments as well as at the tender ones. Clark's desperate lechery, repeatedly broken promises to himself to reform, his snobbery, his political inanities, his low moments of self-rebuke and even his hypochondria are all very reminiscent of that great diarist, James Boswell and, at times, of Samuel Pepys himself. The diaries of the high-minded and consistent cannot be nearly as amusing. </p> <p>This volume is duller than the first, later one, simply because less happens to Clark during it; he is not so central to political life and has less to reveal. Debts, health, his lack of real political success and his gloom about his children and properties produce a whining note at times which grates. The high comedy is here - his buying-off of a former mistress with the help of Jonathan Aitken and a briefcase with a bugging device is one for the anthologies - but it is less rich than the previous volume. </p> <p>Alan Clark wanted to make the world gasp and tremble. In the end, he made it gasp and giggle instead. The answer to the 'Nazi question' was less that Alan-didn't-really-believe-it, more that no-one-really-believed-in-him. </p> <p>That, I suspect, was a source of real private pain, too private, even, to be recorded in his diaries. Good news for the rest of us, though.</p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Marr is political editor of the BBC</p>",

      "body": "<p>As the ferry steams out of the tiny New England harbour of Wood's Hole, it takes less than an hour's sailing through the choppy Atlantic waters to have a first sight of the island of Martha's Vineyard, which along with its neighbour, Nantucket, is one of the most sought-after holiday destinations in North America. These islands have hardly changed since the first colonial settlers arrived 350 years ago, the architecture preserved, the natural landscapes protected from any kind of development. </p> <p>These wild, out-of-the-way isles adapt to the seasons like chameleons. In spring and autumn they are peaceful, perfect for walking and cycling through wetlands and miles of silvery beaches and sandy dunes. There will be plenty of room at the picturesque 'country inns', refined guesthouses oozing traditional New England style, generous hospitality and attractive prices. There is never any problem booking a table at gourmet restaurants, and this is a great time for being casual, with nothing better than a famous 'clambake' at the beach, a feast of locally-caught clams, mussels and lobsters. </p> <p>In midsummer the islands are transformed into an exclusive playground for the rich and famous. Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket are the long-time vacation home of the Kennedys and more recently the favourite escape for Bill Clinton and his family, and in July and August, half of Hollywood - from Sylvester Stallone and Dustin Hoffman, to Sharon Stone and Cameron Diaz - descends. There is a price to pay for rubbing shoulders with movie stars at the bar of the renowned Black Dog Tavern, or waiting in line next to a famous rock singer to choose an exotic sorbet at Mad Martha's ice cream parlour. </p> <p>The population of the islands grows 10-fold in summer, accommodation rates double, and suddenly everyone is vying to get dinner reservations at exclusive dining spots such as L'Etoile on Martha's Vineyard or the Chanticleer in Nantucket, where the bill will come to a lot more than one for the clambake. Whenever you decide to visit - and the islands are ideally situated between New York and Boston - a detour takes you to a different world, a different pace of life, where there's no crime, no traffic lights, no stress, and just lots of laid-back entertain ment, with regular music, art and cinema festivals, farmers markets, bargain antique stores, and village fairs. </p> <p>Outside the peak summer period, hotels on the island offer deals - lower midweek prices, large off-season discounts. Try to negotiate the best price when making a reservation. Although you will discover some of the most luxurious 'country inns' in the US, there is a range of reasonably priced accommodation too. There are few modern hotels thanks to a strict environmental policy: the historical eighteenth and nineteenth-century clapboard wooden houses have been renovated for today's visitor. </p> <p>Here are some addresses to suit different pockets. The prices quoted are for a double room, from low to high season. Most include a traditional American breakfast, so large you can usually forget about lunch. There are also recommendations for the best evening dining on both islands </p> <p><strong> Martha's Vineyard</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Hob Knob Inn</strong> <br> 128 Main Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 9510, fax 00 1 508 627 4560, email: <a href=\"mailto:hobknob@vineyard.net\">hobknob@vineyard.net</a>).<br> $100-500<br> Ultra-luxury country inn, where John Kennedy once stayed. Sumptuous rooms, gourmet breakfast and traditional afternoon tea - including freshly squeezed lemonade. There is also a spa and fitness centre, and organised boat trips for sports fishing. </p> <p><strong> Tuscany Inn</strong> <br>22 North water Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 5999, fax 627 6605, email: <a href=\"mailto:tuscany@vineyard.net\">tuscany@vineyard.net</a>).<br>$100-395<br> Perhaps the most beautiful inn on the island, a Tuscan villa style transplanted into a traditional wooden Vineyard cottage. Chic Italian Laura Sbrana presides as guests enjoy frittata, homemade biscotti and strong espresso for breakfast. On some weekends she runs a gastronomic cooking school. </p> <p><strong> Daggett House</strong> <br> 59 North Water Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 4600, fax 627 4611, <a href=\"http://www.mvweb.com/daggett\">www.mvweb.com/daggett</a><br> $100-155<br> Built in 1660 as the first tavern on Martha's Vineyard, the Daggett House has some intriguing rooms, including one in the attic reached by a secret passage. It is just off the busy part of Edgartown, overlooking the harbour, and has a fine restaurant. </p> <p><strong>Charlotte House</strong><br>27 South Summer Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 458, fax 627 4652, <a href=\"mailto:charlotte@relaischateaux\">charlotte@relaischateaux</a>)<br> $200-400<br> The ultimate address for stars and celebrities to escape the crowds, the Charlotte Inn is a beautifully restored white clapboard house, whose opulent interiors resemble an English country manor. </p> <p><strong> The Colonial Inn</strong><br> North Water Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 4711, fax 627 5904, <a href=\"http://www.colonialinnmvy.com\">www.colonialinnmvy.com</a> <br>$100-150 <br> More like a hotel than the island's classic country inns, the turn-of-the-century Colonial Inn is reasonably priced, and there is a delightful top floor terrace for sunset drinks overlooking the harbour of Edgartown. </p> <p><strong> The Edgartown Inn</strong> <br>56 North Water Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 4794, fax 693 9420, <a href=\"http://www.edgartowninn.com\">www.edgartowninn.com</a>). <br> $70-120<br> Built 200 years ago as a whaling captain's residence, this charming inn retains the feel of a private home. The living room is filled with sailing mementos or the snug kitchen with checked tablecloths and vases of freshly cut flowers </p> <p><strong> The Oak House<br></strong> Seaview Avenue, Oak Bluffs (00 1 508 693 4187, fax 696 7385, <a href=\"http://www.vineyard.net/inns\">www.vineyard.net/inns</a>). <br> $120-180<br> A spectacular wooden mansion overlooking the ocean and sandy beach at Oak Bluffs, this is slightly expensive, but each room is individually decorated in quaint, kitsch style. Lovely seaview porch with rattan rocking chairs. </p> <p><strong> The Oak Bluffs Inn<br></strong> Pequot Avenue, Oak Bluffs (00 1 508 693 7171, fax 693 8787, <a href=\"mailto:bmyguest@oakbluffsinn.com\">bmyguest@oakbluffsinn.com</a>). <br> $120-150 <br> Recently renovated by a friendly young couple, this picturesque, brightly painted bed and breakfast has nine charming rooms, mixing Victorian style with modern amenities. Looks out over the famous Gingerbread houses of the Tabernacle. </p> <p><strong> The Ship's Inn</strong> <br> 18 Kennebec Avenue, Oak Bluffs (00 1 508 693 2760). <br> $65-100<br> On a popular back road, squeezed between a Mexican restaurant and the popular Offshore Ale Brewery, this simple, but comfortable inn offers economical prices, though for once, breakfast is not included in the room rate. </p> <p><strong> Vineyard Harbor Motel</strong><br> Beach Road, Vineyard Haven (00 1 508 693 3334, fax 693 0320, <a href=\"http://www.mvy.com/vharbor\">www.mvy.com/vharbor</a>). <br>$65-100 <br> Vineyard Haven may be the most exclusive resort on this island, but it also has some of the cheaper accommodation too, especially this old-fashioned motel with harbour views . </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat and drink </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Black Dog Tavern</strong><br> Beach Street Extension, Vineyard Haven (00 1 508 693 9223). <br> The most famous bar and restaurant on the Vineyard, where all the celebrities, Bill and Hillary Clinton included, come to hang out and supposedly be ignored by the rest of the summer tourists. So the staff have attitude, and there's a lengthy queue to get a table. But not to be missed. </p> <p><strong> The Offshore Ale Brewery<br></strong> Kennebec Avenue, Oak Bluffs (00 1 508 693 2626). <br> Best spot on the island, a vast barn whose first floor has been converted into a microbrewery, brewing excellent beer, while the downstairs is an eclectic mix of noisy pub, hearty restaurant and late-night live venue for local blues, funk and rock bands. </p> <p><strong> Seasons</strong> <br> 19 Circuit Avenue, Oak Bluffs (00 1 508 693 7129).<br> Cheap and friendly bar and restaurant where the portions - especially the spare ribs - are enormous. Not the most stylish venue, but good fun. You might even see local resident singer Carly Simon, and friends like Billy Joel, come in to check out the band. </p> <p><strong> L'Etoile</strong> <br> 27 South Summer Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 4751). <br> Definitely the most fashionable - and expensive - restaurant on Martha's Vineyard. The cuisine is an interesting mix of French, Italian and native American influences, especially dishes featuring pheasant, lobster and crab. If cost is no problem, this is the place to sample some of the finest American wines. </p> <p><strong> The Newes from America Pub</strong> <br> 23 Kelley Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 4397).<br> Many Americans eat early in the evening - even at 5pm - and this packed pub down by the waterfront is one of the few spots serving up until midnight. Classic deli dishes - pastrami on rye, oyster 'po'boy' sandwiches, clam chowder - and they serve lethal cocktails. </p> <p><strong> Nantucket</strong></p> <p> <strong> Where to stay </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Jared Coffin House</strong> <br> 29 Broad Street (00 1 508 228 2400, fax 228 8549, <a href=\"mailto:jchouse@nantucket.net\">jchouse@nantucket.net</a>).<br> $115-160<br> This is the leading luxury inn on Nantucket, and also has one of the island's most elegant restaurants. For once, this historic stately home is redbrick rather than wooden, and the 'country inn breakfast' of dishes like eggs benedict or light fish cakes is exceptional. There are 60 rooms in all. </p> <p><strong> Roberts House</strong> <br> 11 India Street (00 1 508 228 0600, fax 325 4046, <a href=\"mailto:RHInn@aol.com\">RHInn@aol.com</a>).<br> $100-200<br> The grand white colonial fa\u00e7ade of this ancient lodging house, with the US flag flying above the porch, hides a very laid-back place. Covering a whole block, with lovely gardens, the Roberts House consists of four different inns, with different price ranges. </p> <p><strong> Cliff Lodge</strong><br> 9 Cliff Road (00 1 508 228 9480, <a href=\"http://www.cliff_lodge.com\">www.cliff_lodge.com</a>).<br> $105-150<br> A great discovery, this converted 1771 whaling master's home is on a high road out of town with spectacular views over the busy harbour and ocean. Breakfast is served in the flower-filled gardens. Book early - there are only 13 rooms. </p> <p><strong> The Nesbitt Inn</strong> <br> 21 Broad Street (00 1 508 228 0156). <br> $65-95<br> The best bargain spot on Nantucket. Run by the homely Dolly Noblit, whose family have owned the inn for a century, the Victorian house is filled with authentic antique furnishings.

      "bodyText": "As the ferry steams out of the tiny New England harbour of Wood's Hole, it takes less than an hour's sailing through the choppy Atlantic waters to have a first sight of the island of Martha's Vineyard, which along with its neighbour, Nantucket, is one of the most sought-after holiday destinations in North America. These islands have hardly changed since the first colonial settlers arrived 350 years ago, the architecture preserved, the natural landscapes protected from any kind of development. These wild, out-of-the-way isles adapt to the seasons like chameleons. In spring and autumn they are peaceful, perfect for walking and cycling through wetlands and miles of silvery beaches and sandy dunes. There will be plenty of room at the picturesque 'country inns', refined guesthouses oozing traditional New England style, generous hospitality and attractive prices. There is never any problem booking a table at gourmet restaurants, and this is a great time for being casual, with nothing better than a famous 'clambake' at the beach, a feast of locally-caught clams, mussels and lobsters. In midsummer the islands are transformed into an exclusive playground for the rich and famous. Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket are the long-time vacation home of the Kennedys and more recently the favourite escape for Bill Clinton and his family, and in July and August, half of Hollywood - from Sylvester Stallone and Dustin Hoffman, to Sharon Stone and Cameron Diaz - descends. There is a price to pay for rubbing shoulders with movie stars at the bar of the renowned Black Dog Tavern, or waiting in line next to a famous rock singer to choose an exotic sorbet at Mad Martha's ice cream parlour. The population of the islands grows 10-fold in summer, accommodation rates double, and suddenly everyone is vying to get dinner reservations at exclusive dining spots such as L'Etoile on Martha's Vineyard or the Chanticleer in Nantucket, where the bill will come to a lot more than one for the clambake. Whenever you decide to visit - and the islands are ideally situated between New York and Boston - a detour takes you to a different world, a different pace of life, where there's no crime, no traffic lights, no stress, and just lots of laid-back entertain ment, with regular music, art and cinema festivals, farmers markets, bargain antique stores, and village fairs. Outside the peak summer period, hotels on the island offer deals - lower midweek prices, large off-season discounts. Try to negotiate the best price when making a reservation. Although you will discover some of the most luxurious 'country inns' in the US, there is a range of reasonably priced accommodation too. There are few modern hotels thanks to a strict environmental policy: the historical eighteenth and nineteenth-century clapboard wooden houses have been renovated for today's visitor. Here are some addresses to suit different pockets. The prices quoted are for a double room, from low to high season. Most include a traditional American breakfast, so large you can usually forget about lunch. There are also recommendations for the best evening dining on both islands Martha's Vineyard Where to stay Hob Knob Inn 128 Main Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 9510, fax 00 1 508 627 4560, email: hobknob@vineyard.net). $100-500 Ultra-luxury country inn, where John Kennedy once stayed. Sumptuous rooms, gourmet breakfast and traditional afternoon tea - including freshly squeezed lemonade. There is also a spa and fitness centre, and organised boat trips for sports fishing. Tuscany Inn 22 North water Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 5999, fax 627 6605, email: tuscany@vineyard.net). $100-395 Perhaps the most beautiful inn on the island, a Tuscan villa style transplanted into a traditional wooden Vineyard cottage. Chic Italian Laura Sbrana presides as guests enjoy frittata, homemade biscotti and strong espresso for breakfast. On some weekends she runs a gastronomic cooking school. Daggett House 59 North Water Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 4600, fax 627 4611, www.mvweb.com/daggett $100-155 Built in 1660 as the first tavern on Martha's Vineyard, the Daggett House has some intriguing rooms, including one in the attic reached by a secret passage. It is just off the busy part of Edgartown, overlooking the harbour, and has a fine restaurant. Charlotte House 27 South Summer Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 458, fax 627 4652, charlotte@relaischateaux) $200-400 The ultimate address for stars and celebrities to escape the crowds, the Charlotte Inn is a beautifully restored white clapboard house, whose opulent interiors resemble an English country manor. The Colonial Inn North Water Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 4711, fax 627 5904, www.colonialinnmvy.com $100-150 More like a hotel than the island's classic country inns, the turn-of-the-century Colonial Inn is reasonably priced, and there is a delightful top floor terrace for sunset drinks overlooking the harbour of Edgartown. The Edgartown Inn 56 North Water Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 4794, fax 693 9420, www.edgartowninn.com). $70-120 Built 200 years ago as a whaling captain's residence, this charming inn retains the feel of a private home. The living room is filled with sailing mementos or the snug kitchen with checked tablecloths and vases of freshly cut flowers The Oak House Seaview Avenue, Oak Bluffs (00 1 508 693 4187, fax 696 7385, www.vineyard.net/inns). $120-180 A spectacular wooden mansion overlooking the ocean and sandy beach at Oak Bluffs, this is slightly expensive, but each room is individually decorated in quaint, kitsch style. Lovely seaview porch with rattan rocking chairs. The Oak Bluffs Inn Pequot Avenue, Oak Bluffs (00 1 508 693 7171, fax 693 8787, bmyguest@oakbluffsinn.com). $120-150 Recently renovated by a friendly young couple, this picturesque, brightly painted bed and breakfast has nine charming rooms, mixing Victorian style with modern amenities. Looks out over the famous Gingerbread houses of the Tabernacle. The Ship's Inn 18 Kennebec Avenue, Oak Bluffs (00 1 508 693 2760). $65-100 On a popular back road, squeezed between a Mexican restaurant and the popular Offshore Ale Brewery, this simple, but comfortable inn offers economical prices, though for once, breakfast is not included in the room rate. Vineyard Harbor Motel Beach Road, Vineyard Haven (00 1 508 693 3334, fax 693 0320, www.mvy.com/vharbor). $65-100 Vineyard Haven may be the most exclusive resort on this island, but it also has some of the cheaper accommodation too, especially this old-fashioned motel with harbour views . Where to eat and drink Black Dog Tavern Beach Street Extension, Vineyard Haven (00 1 508 693 9223). The most famous bar and restaurant on the Vineyard, where all the celebrities, Bill and Hillary Clinton included, come to hang out and supposedly be ignored by the rest of the summer tourists. So the staff have attitude, and there's a lengthy queue to get a table. But not to be missed. The Offshore Ale Brewery Kennebec Avenue, Oak Bluffs (00 1 508 693 2626). Best spot on the island, a vast barn whose first floor has been converted into a microbrewery, brewing excellent beer, while the downstairs is an eclectic mix of noisy pub, hearty restaurant and late-night live venue for local blues, funk and rock bands. Seasons 19 Circuit Avenue, Oak Bluffs (00 1 508 693 7129). Cheap and friendly bar and restaurant where the portions - especially the spare ribs - are enormous. Not the most stylish venue, but good fun. You might even see local resident singer Carly Simon, and friends like Billy Joel, come in to check out the band. L'Etoile 27 South Summer Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 4751). Definitely the most fashionable - and expensive - restaurant on Martha's Vineyard. The cuisine is an interesting mix of French, Italian and native American influences, especially dishes featuring pheasant, lobster and crab. If cost is no problem, this is the place to sample some of the finest American wines. The Newes from America Pub 23 Kelley Street, Edgartown (00 1 508 627 4397). Many Americans eat early in the evening - even at 5pm - and this packed pub down by the waterfront is one of the few spots serving up until midnight. Classic deli dishes - pastrami on rye, oyster 'po'boy' sandwiches, clam chowder - and they serve lethal cocktails. Nantucket Where to stay Jared Coffin House 29 Broad Street (00 1 508 228 2400, fax 228 8549, jchouse@nantucket.net). $115-160 This is the leading luxury inn on Nantucket, and also has one of the island's most elegant restaurants. For once, this historic stately home is redbrick rather than wooden, and the 'country inn breakfast' of dishes like eggs benedict or light fish cakes is exceptional. There are 60 rooms in all. Roberts House 11 India Street (00 1 508 228 0600, fax 325 4046, RHInn@aol.com). $100-200 The grand white colonial fa\u00e7ade of this ancient lodging house, with the US flag flying above the porch, hides a very laid-back place. Covering a whole block, with lovely gardens, the Roberts House consists of four different inns, with different price ranges. Cliff Lodge 9 Cliff Road (00 1 508 228 9480, www.cliff_lodge.com). $105-150 A great discovery, this converted 1771 whaling master's home is on a high road out of town with spectacular views over the busy harbour and ocean. Breakfast is served in the flower-filled gardens. Book early - there are only 13 rooms. The Nesbitt Inn 21 Broad Street (00 1 508 228 0156). $65-95 The best bargain spot on Nantucket. Run by the homely Dolly Noblit, whose family have owned the inn for a century, the Victorian house is filled with authentic antique furnishings. Just remember that bathrooms are shared and breakfast is 'Continental' rather than hearty 'American'. Centerboard Guest House 8 Chester Street (00 1 508 228 9696, fax 325 4798, centerbo@nantucket.net). $110-185 Only six rooms, all beautifully decorated, in this tiny wooden guesthouse just out of the town, must book well in advance. Periwinkle Guest House 9 North Water Street (00 1 508 228 9267, fax 325 4046, www.oneweb.com/nantucket/). $75-125 Its wooden walls painted a beautiful pastel yellow, the friendly Periwinkle has a wide range of rooms to suite different budgets, and a smaller cottage next door.It is just behind the Whaling Museum. Centre Street Inn 78 Centre Street (00 1 508 228 0199, fax 228 8676, inn@nantucket.net). $75-150 Dating back to 1742, this is one of the oldest houses on Nantucket, perfectly preserved today. The 13 guest rooms cover a wide price range, and there's a lovely summer patio and lounge. The Inn at Captain's Corner 89 Easton Street (00 1 508 228 1692, captainscorner@nii.net). $60-100 The Captain's Corner is just five minutes walk away on the outskirts of the main town, which explains its moderate room rates. Feels as if you're really staying in a friendly family home. Le Languedoc 24 Broad Street (00 1 508 228 4298, fax 228 4682, www.lelanguedoc.com $60-150 Just as well-known for its gourmet French restaurant as its comfortable rooms, the Languedoc spreads over two adjoining houses, just off the water front. Martin House Inn 61 Centre Street (00 1 508 228 0678, martinn@nantucket.net). $65-150 Originally a mariner's home, built in 1804, this romantic spot has grand bedrooms with lace curtains and four-poster canopy beds, and also cosy, lower priced rooms. Where to eat and drink Nantucket Tapas 15 South Beach Street (00 1 508 228 2033). Original designer restaurant on the waterfront, where young chef Terry Noyes creates dishes that mix Spanish tapas with sushi, Chinese wok-fried vegetables with fresh Nantucket seafood - tuna carpaccio, shrimp dim sum, lobster ravioli, steamed clams and mussels, cold smoked scallops. The Chanticleer Sconset Village (00 1 508 257 6231). Hidden in the idyllic village of Sconset, the Chanticleer is in a different league from other island eateries. French chef Jean-Charles Berruet has lived in Nantucket for more than 20 years, and his cuisine attracts the likes of Michael Douglas and Henry Kissinger. In summer, there is the most beautiful flower garden imaginable. The Brotherhood of Thieves 25 Broad Street (00 1 508 228 2400) Atmospheric bar echoing the colourful past of Nantucket, serving inexpensive meals. Pretty garden in summer, often with live music at night. The Tap Room 29 Broad Street. In the basement of the Jared House, this all-wood tavern could be inside an ancient whaling ship. Tourists sit round dark tables while colourful locals crowd round the long bar, noisily discussing the season's fishing. Dave's Soda Fountain 47 Main Street. Inside the quaint Congdon's Pharmacy, step into America's past with red plastic swivel stools round the old fashioned soda fountain. All of town stops off for morning coffee and a gossip update.",

      "body": "<p> You approach East Hampton from the west, from New York. There are slow trains and, for the endemic rich, their own fast planes - a local form of pollution - but it's part of the ritual to go by road on the atrocious Long Island Expressway. The suffering turns a simple 100-mile journey into a rite of passage for true believers. It's a brutal and unedifying experience: as the traffic swarms out of the sewer-like Midtown Tunnel there are two hours of bottleneck and bad tempered graunching and parping before the surly bonds of NYC let go, releasing the traveller into a landscape of farms, shingle houses and oceanic skies. </p> <p>Most people go by car, although there is a bus: the famous Hampton Jitney. Only in such an absurd principality of privilege as East Hampton would the logic of inverted snobbismo turn a very ordinary motor coach into cult transport. Paul McCartney was seen getting off recently. Jitney is old Jewish slang for nickel, hence any thing cheap. But that's changed: it's now $43, yet they nicely maintain the ethnic association with a complimentary bag of pretzels to help fill the great vacancies of a journey that follows a perverse reverse migration with Manhattan as the old country, and East Hampton as the beckoning New World. </p> <p>East Hampton is not a resort, it's a dormitory. So it's a bit like a mirror image Ellis Island, although - it must be said - rather more exclusive. There are few hotels as these would encourage non-members. The Maidstone Arms, smugly claustrophobic in a Home Counties way, is an exception. It was run by Gordon Campbell Gray before he returned to London to create the quintessentially urban hotel, Number One Aldwych. Yet although East Hampton's summer population swells enormously, few of the local property owners holiday there. No, they are in France or Italy leaving $50m houses empty during August. Instead, East Hampton is for weekenders. </p> <p>An East Hampton weekend goes like this. It begins in Manhattan half way through Friday when Mr Millionaire leaves his Manhattan office in his limo. This takes him to JFK where his Gulfstream jet is waiting for the 15-minute journey to East Hampton Airport where another limo whooshes him to the security of his own property. Once safely on his estate our millionaire changes into shorts, and sits it out on his deck entertain ing other celebrities who have undertaken similar journeys. The socialising complete, the process is repeated in reverse on Monday morning : limo, jet, limo, long trousers. Capitalism refreshes itself and moves on. </p> <p> This weekending has been going on since the Fifties, when the distinction between 'drifts' and 'bumpkins', as the demotics were uncharitably described, was established. An early drift was abstract expressionist painter Jackson Pollock - Jack the Dripper - who borrowed $5,000 from Peggy Guggenheim to buy a small house on Fireplace Road up in Springs and then gracelessly killed himself in a 1956 drunk car wreck outside the front door. Another aspiring drift was Jimmy Kirkwood, author of A Chorus Line. </p> <p>Figures like this helped establish an extraordinary reputation for East Hampton, a place different from Eastbourne in the same way that New York is different from London. Each city is big, busy and successful, but only New Yorkers have that insufferable air of self-congratulation. God we're clever to be here! They bring this choking smugness with them to the dorm, making East Hampton perhaps the most self-conscious place on the entire planet. In so doing, they have turned a wince-makingly pretty village into a journalistic obsession: celebrity voyeurism and the appetites of the eccentric rich make great copy. This came to its moment critique in the giddy Eighties when the village was known as Cash Hampton. Hamptonites like playing it down, saying no it's not smart, it's just, like, the place we chill out. We kick back, hang loose, don't care. If only. </p> <p>This is disingenuous: they love saying, 'You'll never see Steven Spielberg, he's just a regular guy' (with a regular $64m house on West End Road). Although, naturally, they are pleased to be able to tell you this. Artifice and dissimulation are everywhere. People struggle to maintain unnatural gardens: they import things and maintain monsoon sprinklers at Wall Street only knows what cost. If grass won't grow, why not try something else? But the extreme cost of the fastidious gardens is the point: to be effective, conspicuous consumption must tread the line between obscure reticence and vulgar display. Pets have personal trainers. Feel my Saab. Not another Porsche. </p> <p>The Hamptons is more than one particular village. It's a generic term for the eastern part of Long Island, but there are important qualifications. No one does snobbery quite as well as the Americans and geographic signifiers are very specific: to qualify for membership as a Hamptonite you have to be on the South Fork of the island and, not only that, you have to be south of the very noisy Route 27. Within the Hamptons, there are further nuances. Bridgehampton just about qualifies, but is contaminated by a large shopping mall (Hamptonites much prefer cuteness). Continuing east you get to Sagaponack. Kurt Vonnegut lives here, so this is very smart. Southampton follows. This is old money: Tom Wolfe, always much more a conservative southern gent than a hip new journalist, has a house on South Main Street. Diverting briefly north, there is Sag Harbor with its boaty flavour and annoying shops. Then comes East Hampton, pretty near the centre of the area, the distillation of its essence, and very much new money (even if it was founded by travellers from Kent in the 1640s). Continuing east you come to Amagansett, more rustic, less fraught. Last, at the most oriental extremity of the Island, is Montauk: rougher, wilder and more maritime. </p> <p> East Hampton operates an exclusion policy. Most obviously, this finds expression in parking. There are no parking garages and, unless you have a resident's permit or are renting for the season, you cannot leave your car for more than two hours. This discriminates against visitors so the Hamptonites have the place to themselves. Compare with St Tropez where anybody bold enough can park his 15-year-old motor-home smack in front of La Pin\u00e8de at no cost and no risk. </p> <p>On the streets a sort of communism de luxe operates in a mysteriously orchestrated dress-down operation. Everyone is in shorts. Only the police wear long trousers. Trainers with white socks are universal. While Ralph Lauren's Polo Country store is busy selling used Levi jackets for $595 and paint-spattered Wrangler jeans (Style of Pollock) for $795, people don't wear them. At least, not in public. Instead, the weekend street is both sartorially and socially an extension of the gym, sweaty rich people in athletic apparel mill about or do stretch exercises against trees. It is horrible. </p> <p>The arrangement of East Hampton's shops is like a diagram of America in the same way as Dante's Circles of Hell was a diagram of late medieval cosmology. On the two main shopping streets, Newtown Lane and Main Street itself, there are modest fa\u00e7ades, but cavernous back-of-house operations stuffed with merchandise and staffed by tanned and toned girls or preening preppy boys. Thus the Polo, DKNY and Banana Republic shops are a symbol of East Hampton itself: effacing on the surface, but in substance very showy. Yet this twee perfection gives way a block back to a different sort of retail experience: here white trailer trash, temporarily imported during working hours as gastarbeiten, work in grim copy shops, dry cleaners and liquor stores which would not look out of place in Fort Wayne, Indiana. </p> <p>The defining shop in East Hampton is, of course, a deli. In this case, The Barefoot Contessa, a continuous cauldron of social activity and you wonder: what sort of strange compulsion to be humiliated makes millionaires wear silly clothes and stand in line for half an hour to buy a coffee? It suddenly becomes evident that one of the biggest distinctions between Europe and the US is America's lack of caf\u00e9 life. It is a measure of the suffocating atmosphere that Ina - Barefoot - Garten's plan to put tables on the streets so millionaires can sit down with their lattes is considered revolutionary. The East Hampton Beaches - with their remarkable light, vast extent, clean sand and Atlantic rollers - are among the finest in the world and anywhere else would have charming bars and seafood restaurants. Here they do not. A remarkable transformation takes place when the lifeguards go off duty at five. Slowly and gingerly, like wild animals tentatively emerging from the jungle, 4wds - headlights on even in the sunshine - step on to the beach (permits required!) with the sophisticated load of equipment required for a primitive clambake. Pits are dug. Easy light charcoal is lit. Corn is roasted. Clams are baked. The music plays. Wine is drunk (in flagrant contravention of the prissy East Hampton Village Beach Rules). One Saturday night I saw in quick succession, Salman Rushdie (alarming in shorts), Stella McCartney, Kim Basinger and Christy Turlington. </p> <p> The houses of the Hamptons are a unique phenomenon: imagine Virginia Water with a magnification of x100. Harper's reports that 0.93 new ones are built every day. The convention among local realtors is that the hierarchy goes cottage, house, estate and, beautifully, an estate becomes a 'compound' if it has guest cabanas. The most sophisticated have up to 12 different heating and air-con zones, so as to complete the entirely hermetic effect the very rich seem to want. Hamptons Online presents the following league table: </p> <p> Adelaide de Menil, oil heiress, 56 acres on Further Lane: $136m <br> Carl Icahn, corporate raider, 8 acres on Lily Pond Road: $99m <br> Bruce Wasserstein, banker, 26 acres on Further Lane: $98m <br> Lary Gagosian, art dealer, 18 acres on Further Lane: $41m </p> <p>And the pitiable: Howard Schultz, Starbucks, 4 acres on Lily Pond Lane: $17.5m </p> <p>East Hampton is irresistibly reminiscent of Ira Levin's 1972 horror classic, The Stepford Wives . From under a surface of fatiguing perfection, terrible currents and tensions threaten to emerge. It is in a luxury coma. Here are the noises of the village, heard solo or in concert: a bizjet on final approach, the thwush-thwush of lawn sprinklers, the bark of an oversized rotary mower handled by a bad tempered Chicano, a strimmer, the rumble of a passing V-8, air-con, the pool pump, a chopper, the penetrating ring of an American phone, a distant television. Here are some of the sights: in the rear view mirror - a matt salmon pink '57 Plymouth Savoy (with roof-mounted surfboard); the car park of the Catholic (ie poor people's) Church egregiously lacking standard-issue luxury 4wds; pale bankers from Paine Webber and Merril Lynch queuing up in the archaic stationery shop to send faxes back to Money HQ; arthritic joggers; parking attendants in day-glo battle fatigues; middle-aged polychromed Lycra-clad Manhattanites over-doing it on carbon-framed racing bikes. </p> <p>The Pleasantville flawlessness and ease is not comforting, it puts you on edge. East Hampton has none of the gradations, sex and style of Europe: there is only one way to fit in and that is to have lots of money. And even that is not enough: you have to abandon all independent thought and expression. Then, enjoy! </p> <p>The excess is nauseating and so is the territorialism. When Time Warner's Steve Ross died in 1992 his widow bought 110 burial plots around the grave, so he wouldn't feel crowded. Martha Stewart, a scary mixture of Richard Branson, Terence Conran, Delia Smith and Mr Motivator, who is Earth Mother around here, petulantly abandoned a landmark house project when a neighbour built a fence and threatened intrusion. </p> <p>There is something infinitely melancholy about being in America, and typical is the haunting, lowing sound of a goods train at night. This you get in the Hamptons as drivers on the quiet Long Island Rail Road respond sympathetically to Hamptonites' sentimental longing for kitsch Americana. No matter how mature US civilization becomes, it never acquires depth. Charles Dickens said in 1834 that it all looked as though it had been built yesterday. Now it just looks as though it was bought yesterday. A vengeful God, cross about complacent consumerism, could do worse than start here. </p> <p>I expressed my distaste to a frequent English visitor, sitting on the swing chair on the stoop one sunny evening, glass of Sag Pond Chardonnay and $40 cheese straws to hand. He said, 'You're either an East Hampton person or you're a Rome person. You get it or you don't.' I said, 'Ciao.' </p> <p>\u0095 'General Knowledge' by Stephen Bayley is published by Booth-Clibborn Editions, \u00a319.95.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You approach East Hampton from the west, from New York. There are slow trains and, for the endemic rich, their own fast planes - a local form of pollution - but it's part of the ritual to go by road on the atrocious Long Island Expressway. The suffering turns a simple 100-mile journey into a rite of passage for true believers. It's a brutal and unedifying experience: as the traffic swarms out of the sewer-like Midtown Tunnel there are two hours of bottleneck and bad tempered graunching and parping before the surly bonds of NYC let go, releasing the traveller into a landscape of farms, shingle houses and oceanic skies. Most people go by car, although there is a bus: the famous Hampton Jitney. Only in such an absurd principality of privilege as East Hampton would the logic of inverted snobbismo turn a very ordinary motor coach into cult transport. Paul McCartney was seen getting off recently. Jitney is old Jewish slang for nickel, hence any thing cheap. But that's changed: it's now $43, yet they nicely maintain the ethnic association with a complimentary bag of pretzels to help fill the great vacancies of a journey that follows a perverse reverse migration with Manhattan as the old country, and East Hampton as the beckoning New World. East Hampton is not a resort, it's a dormitory. So it's a bit like a mirror image Ellis Island, although - it must be said - rather more exclusive. There are few hotels as these would encourage non-members. The Maidstone Arms, smugly claustrophobic in a Home Counties way, is an exception. It was run by Gordon Campbell Gray before he returned to London to create the quintessentially urban hotel, Number One Aldwych. Yet although East Hampton's summer population swells enormously, few of the local property owners holiday there. No, they are in France or Italy leaving $50m houses empty during August. Instead, East Hampton is for weekenders. An East Hampton weekend goes like this. It begins in Manhattan half way through Friday when Mr Millionaire leaves his Manhattan office in his limo. This takes him to JFK where his Gulfstream jet is waiting for the 15-minute journey to East Hampton Airport where another limo whooshes him to the security of his own property. Once safely on his estate our millionaire changes into shorts, and sits it out on his deck entertain ing other celebrities who have undertaken similar journeys. The socialising complete, the process is repeated in reverse on Monday morning : limo, jet, limo, long trousers. Capitalism refreshes itself and moves on. This weekending has been going on since the Fifties, when the distinction between 'drifts' and 'bumpkins', as the demotics were uncharitably described, was established. An early drift was abstract expressionist painter Jackson Pollock - Jack the Dripper - who borrowed $5,000 from Peggy Guggenheim to buy a small house on Fireplace Road up in Springs and then gracelessly killed himself in a 1956 drunk car wreck outside the front door. Another aspiring drift was Jimmy Kirkwood, author of A Chorus Line. Figures like this helped establish an extraordinary reputation for East Hampton, a place different from Eastbourne in the same way that New York is different from London. Each city is big, busy and successful, but only New Yorkers have that insufferable air of self-congratulation. God we're clever to be here! They bring this choking smugness with them to the dorm, making East Hampton perhaps the most self-conscious place on the entire planet. In so doing, they have turned a wince-makingly pretty village into a journalistic obsession: celebrity voyeurism and the appetites of the eccentric rich make great copy. This came to its moment critique in the giddy Eighties when the village was known as Cash Hampton. Hamptonites like playing it down, saying no it's not smart, it's just, like, the place we chill out. We kick back, hang loose, don't care. If only. This is disingenuous: they love saying, 'You'll never see Steven Spielberg, he's just a regular guy' (with a regular $64m house on West End Road). Although, naturally, they are pleased to be able to tell you this. Artifice and dissimulation are everywhere.

      "body": "<b> 26 It's like blue eyes or black hair - something you get from your parents</b> <p>Sometimes, yes, but mostly, no. The best evidence comes from a giant twin study - 44,000 pairs of them. Done by the AICR and published in July, it found that even identical twins have only a 10 per cent chance of developing the same cancer. The study estimated that '60 to 70 per cent of all cancers can be avoided by making small, ongoing changes in what we eat and how we live'. Smoking was said to be the number one cause - 35 per cent. In second place was diet, with 30. The accepted genetic element across all cancers is no more than 10 per cent. Within that figure, though, are three cancers with a strong heritable (the word scientists prefer to genetic) component. The twin study gave prostate at 42 per cent, colorectal at 35, and breast at 27. Although there seems to be general agreement about prostate cancer, other researchers disagree on the heritable level of both colorectal and breast. A common figure given for colorectal is 10, but Colon Cancer Concern gives just 6 per cent. And, according to Professor Alan Ashworth of the Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre, London, only 5 to 10 per cent of breast cancers are familial. These are caused by mutation in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. If a woman has either of those, 'it is 85 per cent likely she will develop breast cancer by the age of 70'. </p> <p>What you really want to know, of course, is whether you'll get it. If your parents had cancer, the thing to look out for is if they got it before they were 55 - after that, you're just dealing with the ravages of life. If either parent got colon cancer before they were 55, for example, your odds of getting it are twice what they would have been if your parents had waited until after their 55th birthday - though your odds are still markedly worse than for someone whose parents didn't get it. Even if your family does have a cancer gene, it doesn't mean you're certain to get it. Like blue eyes or colour blindness, it follows the laws of Mendelian genetics What is genetic is your response to drugs. Soon, a simple DNA test - via a finger prick or mouthwash - may make it possible to match the patient to the drug which will be most effective and least unpleasant.</p> <p><b> 27 Most heavy smokers will die of lung cancer</b></p> <p>No. According to US figures, a surprising 85 to 90 per cent of the top risk 20/20s (20 or more gaspers a day for 20 or more years) will not get lung cancer, though they'll probably die younger anyway of a stroke or a heart attack. But the fact is that even the link between smoking and lung cancer is not 100 per cent: something else must be going on - probably a combination of genetics and diet. But - and it's an enormous but - lung cancer has a terrifyingly low survival rate, just 5 per cent. It is the third commonest form of death in the UK. Also, according to the CRC, one-third of all cancers are linked to smoking and it's a major factor in at least 12 different ones. The ICRF adds that 90 per cent of all lung cancers are caused by smoking and that 50 per cent of all persistent cigarette smokers will eventually be killed by their habit. Which also means, of course, that 50 per cent won't. Evens ain't great odds, though, is it.</p> <p><b> 28 Antioxidant supplements accelerate lung cancer in smokers</b></p> <p>The experts are deeply divided on this. Yes, say a pair of trials conducted by the CRC, which showed betacarotene increasing the risk. Yes, says the AICR. No, says Professor Sir Richard Peto. He points to a third trial conducted over a much longer period which showed no such association. A big study run by a Boston hospital, it involved 22,000 American doctors - half took 50mg doses of betacarotene, half took a placebo. Its conclusion: 'Twelve years of supplementation with betacarotene produced neither benefit nor harm in terms of death from all causes.'</p> <p><b> 29 People who smoke only one or two cigarettes a day have nothing to worry about</b></p> <p>No, but the risk is what scientists call 'linear'. Smoking 20 a day gives you an overall 50 per cent chance of dying from the effect - not just cancers but heart and lung disease, too. Smoking two a day brings that risk down to 5 per cent - still the most dangerous thing smokers do in their lives. Scientists are also sceptical about people's ability to stick to two a day. According to ICRF, smokers who stop in middle age avoid most of their later risk of being killed by tobacco, and those who stop before middle age avoid nearly all the risk. People giving up is the main reason lung cancer is dropping faster here than anywhere else in the world. Are cigars safer? Yes, but only if you don't inhale. Also, you run a higher risk of mouth and throat cancer. Is passive smoking really that dangerous? Officially, yes. The estimate is that it kills 300 a year in the UK - the cancer risk is probably 2 per cent of the active smoking risk. Some researchers are still not convinced, though, about the seriousness of the risk. Dr Ken Denson of the Thame Thrombois and Haemostosis Research Foundation says 10 cigarettes a day is fine, that passive smoking is not a problem but that smokers get lung cancer because of their poor diet. Others say that the Thame Thrombois and Haemostosis Research Foundation is a tobacco industry apologist.</p> <p><b> 30 I've got a cough, therefore I haven't got lung cancer</b></p> <p>Er, no. A cough occurs in 80 per cent of lung cancers. </p> <p><b> 31 Not all lung cancer is caused by smoking</b></p> <p>True. According to the ICRF, one in 20 UK cases is caused by radon, the natural gas which leaks up from the earth, particularly in the West Country, and accumulates in houses. However, says an epidemiologist, these 'findings are just at the border or what can be detected in epidemiologic studies. It's actually a pretty small number of lung cancers, particularly in non-smokers.'</p> <p><b> 32 Infertility treatment increases your risk of ovarian cancer</b></p> <p>Sadly, probably so. Basically, it seems that the more eggs a woman produces, the higher her risk. So pregnancy and the pill both reduce that risk, while women who start menstruating early and finish late face an increased chance of getting it. It's as if, over millions of years, women developed reproductive systems that were balanced around their reality of their lives - late puberty because of bad diet, followed by lots of pregnancies (if not always live children) and then an early death. Modern life not being like that, the system is out of whack - and prone to cancer.</p> <p><b> 33 You're more likely to die of it here than in Europe or the US</b></p> <p>True - probably. Cancer researchers are wary of making direct comparisons, but there does seem to be a clear difference. The best comparison is what statisticians call 'age-standardised death rates per million' - that means there is no bias against countries with an ageing population. According to the ONS, for England and Wales, a male figure of 2,674 is slightly worse than Europe's 2,432. When it comes to women, though, the difference is startling - 2,464 to 1,672. It's also widely accepted that our overall survival rate is 40 per cent compared with some of Europe's 50 per cent. In the US, 60 per cent of patients now survive at least five years. For colorectal cancer, the UK survival rate is around 40 per cent compared to Europe's 45 and 60 in the US.</p> <p><b> 34 Loads of children get it and they invariably die</b></p> <p>Not at all. Cancer is overwhelmingly a disease of age. Look at the very latest figures, in the autumn 2000 edition of Health Statistics Quarterly. The peak for both men and women comes at 70 to 74 years of age. Just 5 per cent of male cancers and 9 per cent of female cancers occur in under-45s. And children? Under-15s account for just 0.6 per cent of all cancers - though that's still 1,200 to 1,300 cases a year. A third of those are leukaemia (which is not particularly heritable, by the way) but even there the outlook is neither as it was nor as bleak as people think. Improved chemo routines and refinement of bone-marrow transplants have cut childhood leukaemia deaths by 57 per cent in the US and 50 per cent here. The UK recovery rate for childhood cancers is 60 per cent overall, 90 per cent for some. That's why there are 18,000 survivors out there. On the other hand, it's still the most common cause of death from illness in children.</p> <p><b> 35 Only humans get it</b></p> <p>Not true. Domestic and farm animals and birds and fish all get it. Wild animals? Mostly, no. They don't live long enough to get it - because they don't have the antibiotics and medical care we give to our pets and prospective dinners. Recent US research, though, suggests those other top-of-the-food-chainers, sharks, do get it.</p> <p><b> 36 You can get it from the barbie</b></p> <p>Maybe, but unlikely. The blackened crust on a piece of BBQed meat or fish contains heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), which are certainly carcinogenic. The same applies to grilling and frying in very hot oil. In fact, no one has actually been able to implicate barbecuing in cancers. Also, according to the ICRF, lab tests that showed the DNA damage, which is central to the cancer process, used much higher doses of the chemicals than humans consume - though it still recommends not eating large quantities of charred food. The AICR also issues an annual warning at the start of the summer grilling season. It recommends avoiding charred food and eating grilled meat and fish only occasionally. If you must, it advises using lean meat (bye bye ribs, so long bangers), cutting the fat and skin off, removing any charred sections and using tongs - puncturing the surface allows fat to drip down and cause flame-ups, which produce another kind of carcinogen, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However - and it's a big, happy however - you can cut the risk by marinating the meat or fish. Lab tests produced a 99 per cent reduction in HCA and even brief baths in the marinade 'produced significant reductions'. Why? Scientists guess it's because typical marinade ingredients - vinegar, citrus juice, herbs, spices, olive oil - are famously full of the anti-cancer good stuff. Would that then mean that barbied fruit and veg aren't a problem? It would. They pose no known health risk, according to AICR director of nutrition education, Melanie Polk. 'And if you're looking for an exciting but healthy summertime dessert, try grilled fruit. The grill's heat caramelises the fruit's sugar and lends a more intense and deliciously sweet flavour.'</p> <p><b> 37 Scotland is the cancer capital of the world</b></p> <p>There's some truth in that. Scottish cancer rates have been steadily increasing for years, particularly among poor men. The guess is that they are slower in seeing a doctor - and early diagnosis is closely linked to survival. The Scottish Cancer Intelligence Unit made international comparisons, with the US and a range of European countries, including England and Wales (still a unit, as far as statisticians are concerned). It reported: 'In both sexes, incidence and mortality rates were among the highest, whereas survival was the lowest.' Though perhaps no worse than England and Wales, according to the report.</p> <p><b> 38 High-earning whites are more likely to get testicular cancer than black men</b></p> <p>Odd but true, according to the CRC.</p> <p><b> 39 Cancer is caused by stress</b></p> <p>Doesn't seem so. There is, however, some evidence that stress may trigger relapses. A late-80s study by Professor Amanda Ramirez of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Psychosocial Oncology Group compared female breast cancer victims who'd had a relapse with those who hadn't. Those who got it again were significantly more likely to have suffered traumatic life events - divorce, bereavement, bankruptcy, etc. Professor Ramirez thinks any potential link here is hormonal - oestrogen levels in the case of breast cancer. </p> <p><b> 40 Too many kippers will give you stomach cancer</b></p> <p>Yes and no. While it's true that there is an established link between stomach cancer and a diet heavy in smoked and/or pickled foods, you have to eat them in quite un-British quantities. 'The cause of the association is not clear, however,' said David Forman, professor of cancer epidemiology at the University of Leeds and honorary consultant to the ICRF. 'Preserved foods of this kind are often consumed as part of a poor diet, deficient in fresh fruit and veg. So it is unclear whether it is something in the smoked/pickled foods themselves or the lack of fresh food - or both - which increases the risk.' The classic example is Japan, where even now they don't eat much fruit and veg. Stomach cancer is closely linked to the bacterium Helicobacter pylori - according to an international study led by Dr David Forman, those infected are six times more likely to develop it.</p> <p><b> 41 The sun gives you skin cancer</b></p> <p>Ish. The fairness of your skin is the crucial factor. The paler it is, the greater the risk. The highest incidence of melanomas is in Queensland, Australia, the lowest is in Bombay - not exactly a sun-free spot. </p> <p><b> 42 Selenium protects against cancer, and therefore I should take it as a supplement</b></p> <p>Respectively, yes and no. Selenium does seem to help with lung, colon, oesophagal and prostate cancers - heart disease, too. 'It's a potent antioxidant which can block cell DNA damage,' says Dr Peter E Newburger of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. It helps the enzymes which break down the free radicals that damage cells. But you almost certainly already get enough selenium in your diet - 55 micrograms a day for women, 70 for men. Too much can have serious side effects, from nausea up to cirrhosis of the liver. 'It's toxic when taken at high levels,' says Dr Newburger. 'This is not a case of: if a little is good, a lot is better.'</p> <p><b> 43 Children who live near nuclear power plants get more cancer</b></p> <p>Probably not. Despite extensive and continuing investigations of links between childhood cancers and nuclear installations, no clear clear risk difference has yet been established. Childhood leukaemia is caused by a mix of genetics and environment, it seems. A child is born with leukaemic cells but doesn't develop the disease until three or four years later. What happens? Well, childhood leukaemia seems to be linked with affluence, though that influence levels off. It is still rising here, but has levelled off in Sweden, which is more affluent. Also, clusters occur in large new residential areas. New people bring in new bugs, which trigger the abnormal reaction which kicks off the leukaemia.</p> <p><b> 44 Untreated, all cancers will eventually kill</b></p> <p>No. Occasionally, tumours disappear by themselves.</p> <p><b> 45 Survival rates vary across the regions according to wealth</b></p> <p>Yes, for nearly all cancerselves.</p> <p><b> 46 Aspirin stops you getting cancer</b></p> <p>It certainly seems to do something. The CRC is running tests to see if it prevents further polyps in people who have had cancerous colorectal polyps removed. It has also been linked with hindering prostate cancer.</p> <p><b> 47 Expensive anti-cancer drugs are the major part of NHS care costs</b></p> <p>No. The drugs bill is probably around 6 per cent of the total care cost. Most of the money goes on looking after hospitalised patients. Also, though some drugs are very expensive, not all are. Tamoxifen, for example, is out of patent and therefore cheap, just \u00a310 a month. </p> <p><b> 48 I've survived one year, therefore I'll be OK</b></p> <p>It depends on the cancer. Your prospects are modest after a year. They are 'reasonably favourable' after five years, though, for most cancers. Particularly so, according to Trends in Cancer Survival in Scotland, 1971-1995, if you're young and not poor. </p> <p><b> 49 Scientists still don't know what cancer is and how it works</b></p> <p>Wrong. As Dr John Potter said in his keynote address at the AICR annual conference in September, 'In the last decade particularly, our knowledge of the cancer process itself has significantly deepened.' They now have a thorough understanding of what goes inside a cancer cell. Multiple faults in the cell's DNA - at least more than three - are required to turn a normal healthy cell into a cancerous, 'immortal' one. What kicks this process off? Probably things such as radiation and stuff in the food we eat, but the key thing is the general ageing process. Anything particular scientists are paying close attention to? The tumour-suppressor P-53 is thought to be a prime suspect in 50 per cent of cases. Cancer kills because it metastasises - spreads. The 'immortal' cells break off from their original base and migrate through the body, setting up new colonies. Sometimes they base themselves on other organs and stop them working. Other times, the simple alienness of their presence just throws the body's system for a loop, smashing into the immune and endocrine systems, knocking their settings to hell. Too much or too little of the body's regulatory chemicals are released. Patients stop being able to absorb nutrients. So that means scientists have a full understanding of human cancer? Er, no. 'In the laboratory,' adds Dr Potter, 'the cancer process from healthy cell to cancerous tumour is relatively well worked out. In the human body, however, it is much less clear.'</p> <p><b> 50 There's a cure round the corner</b></p> <p>Probably not. Cancer is more than 200 cancers - so a single cure is very unlikely. To mix up the clich\u00e9s, there have been a lot of false dawns and great white hopes. Anti-angiogenesis medications, for example, were big in 1998. Now some say that initial promise has not been fulfilled, though the ICRF disagrees, saying it is 'an exciting area of research'. There are hopes, though. Researchers at Imperial College and the Royal Free Hospital have found stem cells in the bone marrow that can turn into liver cells. The idea would be that a damaged liver could be reconstructed out of new, healthy, cancer-free stem cells. Dr Malcolm Alison of Imperial College says: 'Adult stem cells offer great promise... as they may generate the full spectrum of cell types needed to repair a damaged organ.' Geron Corporation and Duke University have recently come up with the enticing notion of a universal (and patentable) vaccine for cancer, based on the enzyme telomerase, which is found at high levels in tumour cells. Unfortunately for Geron and Duke, it's also found at similar levels elsewhere in the body - bone marrow stem cells, for example. Using it to zap sick cells might also wipe out healthy cells. Another possible advance is making targeted vaccine from the RNA of tumour cells. 'This is quite neat,' says Professor Nick Lemoine of the ICRF, but it's very much a top-dollar option - each patient will have to have a tailor-made vaccine. 'Many oncologists now believe we are entering a golden age of drug discovery,' says the ICRF, pointing to the potential spin-offs from the human genome project. 'I am more sceptical,' says an epidemiologist. 'All genetically engineered drugs are ridiculously expensive, as the biotech companies pay off their investors who took a beating for so many start-up years.'</p> <p>And finally: what do cancer experts have for lunch? On 1 September, at the Renaissance Mayflower Hotel, Washington DC, many of the world's leading experts were gathered for the Tenth Annual Research Conference of the AICR, which focused on 'The role of nutrition in preventing and treating breast and prostate cancer'. Dr Ritva Butrum, an AICR VP, organised the catering for lunch. Chef Norman Wade actually did the cooking.

The vegetables in the couscous salad are heavy on 'cancer-protective phytochemicals': asparagus has saponins and tomatoes have lycopene - which are linked to reduced prostate cancer risk.

      "bodyText": "26 It's like blue eyes or black hair - something you get from your parents Sometimes, yes, but mostly, no. The best evidence comes from a giant twin study - 44,000 pairs of them. Done by the AICR and published in July, it found that even identical twins have only a 10 per cent chance of developing the same cancer. The study estimated that '60 to 70 per cent of all cancers can be avoided by making small, ongoing changes in what we eat and how we live'. Smoking was said to be the number one cause - 35 per cent. In second place was diet, with 30. The accepted genetic element across all cancers is no more than 10 per cent. Within that figure, though, are three cancers with a strong heritable (the word scientists prefer to genetic) component. The twin study gave prostate at 42 per cent, colorectal at 35, and breast at 27. Although there seems to be general agreement about prostate cancer, other researchers disagree on the heritable level of both colorectal and breast. A common figure given for colorectal is 10, but Colon Cancer Concern gives just 6 per cent. And, according to Professor Alan Ashworth of the Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre, London, only 5 to 10 per cent of breast cancers are familial. These are caused by mutation in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. If a woman has either of those, 'it is 85 per cent likely she will develop breast cancer by the age of 70'. What you really want to know, of course, is whether you'll get it. If your parents had cancer, the thing to look out for is if they got it before they were 55 - after that, you're just dealing with the ravages of life. If either parent got colon cancer before they were 55, for example, your odds of getting it are twice what they would have been if your parents had waited until after their 55th birthday - though your odds are still markedly worse than for someone whose parents didn't get it. Even if your family does have a cancer gene, it doesn't mean you're certain to get it. Like blue eyes or colour blindness, it follows the laws of Mendelian genetics What is genetic is your response to drugs. Soon, a simple DNA test - via a finger prick or mouthwash - may make it possible to match the patient to the drug which will be most effective and least unpleasant. 27 Most heavy smokers will die of lung cancer No. According to US figures, a surprising 85 to 90 per cent of the top risk 20/20s (20 or more gaspers a day for 20 or more years) will not get lung cancer, though they'll probably die younger anyway of a stroke or a heart attack. But the fact is that even the link between smoking and lung cancer is not 100 per cent: something else must be going on - probably a combination of genetics and diet. But - and it's an enormous but - lung cancer has a terrifyingly low survival rate, just 5 per cent. It is the third commonest form of death in the UK. Also, according to the CRC, one-third of all cancers are linked to smoking and it's a major factor in at least 12 different ones. The ICRF adds that 90 per cent of all lung cancers are caused by smoking and that 50 per cent of all persistent cigarette smokers will eventually be killed by their habit. Which also means, of course, that 50 per cent won't. Evens ain't great odds, though, is it. 28 Antioxidant supplements accelerate lung cancer in smokers The experts are deeply divided on this. Yes, say a pair of trials conducted by the CRC, which showed betacarotene increasing the risk. Yes, says the AICR. No, says Professor Sir Richard Peto. He points to a third trial conducted over a much longer period which showed no such association. A big study run by a Boston hospital, it involved 22,000 American doctors - half took 50mg doses of betacarotene, half took a placebo. Its conclusion: 'Twelve years of supplementation with betacarotene produced neither benefit nor harm in terms of death from all causes.' 29 People who smoke only one or two cigarettes a day have nothing to worry about No, but the risk is what scientists call 'linear'. Smoking 20 a day gives you an overall 50 per cent chance of dying from the effect - not just cancers but heart and lung disease, too. Smoking two a day brings that risk down to 5 per cent - still the most dangerous thing smokers do in their lives. Scientists are also sceptical about people's ability to stick to two a day. According to ICRF, smokers who stop in middle age avoid most of their later risk of being killed by tobacco, and those who stop before middle age avoid nearly all the risk. People giving up is the main reason lung cancer is dropping faster here than anywhere else in the world. Are cigars safer? Yes, but only if you don't inhale. Also, you run a higher risk of mouth and throat cancer. Is passive smoking really that dangerous? Officially, yes. The estimate is that it kills 300 a year in the UK - the cancer risk is probably 2 per cent of the active smoking risk. Some researchers are still not convinced, though, about the seriousness of the risk. Dr Ken Denson of the Thame Thrombois and Haemostosis Research Foundation says 10 cigarettes a day is fine, that passive smoking is not a problem but that smokers get lung cancer because of their poor diet. Others say that the Thame Thrombois and Haemostosis Research Foundation is a tobacco industry apologist. 30 I've got a cough, therefore I haven't got lung cancer Er, no. A cough occurs in 80 per cent of lung cancers. 31 Not all lung cancer is caused by smoking True. According to the ICRF, one in 20 UK cases is caused by radon, the natural gas which leaks up from the earth, particularly in the West Country, and accumulates in houses. However, says an epidemiologist, these 'findings are just at the border or what can be detected in epidemiologic studies. It's actually a pretty small number of lung cancers, particularly in non-smokers.' 32 Infertility treatment increases your risk of ovarian cancer Sadly, probably so. Basically, it seems that the more eggs a woman produces, the higher her risk. So pregnancy and the pill both reduce that risk, while women who start menstruating early and finish late face an increased chance of getting it. It's as if, over millions of years, women developed reproductive systems that were balanced around their reality of their lives - late puberty because of bad diet, followed by lots of pregnancies (if not always live children) and then an early death. Modern life not being like that, the system is out of whack - and prone to cancer. 33 You're more likely to die of it here than in Europe or the US True - probably. Cancer researchers are wary of making direct comparisons, but there does seem to be a clear difference. The best comparison is what statisticians call 'age-standardised death rates per million' - that means there is no bias against countries with an ageing population. According to the ONS, for England and Wales, a male figure of 2,674 is slightly worse than Europe's 2,432. When it comes to women, though, the difference is startling - 2,464 to 1,672. It's also widely accepted that our overall survival rate is 40 per cent compared with some of Europe's 50 per cent. In the US, 60 per cent of patients now survive at least five years. For colorectal cancer, the UK survival rate is around 40 per cent compared to Europe's 45 and 60 in the US. 34 Loads of children get it and they invariably die Not at all. Cancer is overwhelmingly a disease of age. Look at the very latest figures, in the autumn 2000 edition of Health Statistics Quarterly. The peak for both men and women comes at 70 to 74 years of age. Just 5 per cent of male cancers and 9 per cent of female cancers occur in under-45s. And children? Under-15s account for just 0.6 per cent of all cancers - though that's still 1,200 to 1,300 cases a year. A third of those are leukaemia (which is not particularly heritable, by the way) but even there the outlook is neither as it was nor as bleak as people think. Improved chemo routines and refinement of bone-marrow transplants have cut childhood leukaemia deaths by 57 per cent in the US and 50 per cent here. The UK recovery rate for childhood cancers is 60 per cent overall, 90 per cent for some. That's why there are 18,000 survivors out there. On the other hand, it's still the most common cause of death from illness in children. 35 Only humans get it Not true. Domestic and farm animals and birds and fish all get it. Wild animals? Mostly, no. They don't live long enough to get it - because they don't have the antibiotics and medical care we give to our pets and prospective dinners. Recent US research, though, suggests those other top-of-the-food-chainers, sharks, do get it. 36 You can get it from the barbie Maybe, but unlikely.

      "body": "<b> Philip McQueen (\u00a350,000)</b> <br> 43, divorced, service manager of pharmaceuticals company, lives in Manchester When Philip McQueen was divorced last year, he banked \u00a316,000 - his share of the profit from the sale of the marital home. In less than 12 months, he'd spent it all, along with his regular salary, on going out, clothes, records, books, and holidays. Especially holidays. 'I've never saved money, and in the past 10 years there's never been a single month when I haven't been overdrawn. I just believe \u00ba \u00aa that it's there to be spent. But it would be true to say that I went even more overboard than usual last year. I was fairly miserable, so I spent money on trying to feel better. To a certain extent it worked.' <p>Since his divorce, Philip has rented a two-bedroom flat in the middle of Manchester, which costs \u00a3700 a month. 'I spend about \u00a3100 on petrol, \u00a338 monthly gym membership, \u00a330-40 on records, and the same again for books and magazines.' Food isn't a big priority. 'I spend about \u00a33 a day for a lunch from Marks &amp; Spencer, and maybe \u00a330-40 a week on the rest.' But clothes are important. 'I buy them all the time, and I don't like cheap clothes. If a shirt is \u00a3150, and I like it, I'll have it. I go to the gym all the time, so I have a new pair of trainers every other month at about \u00a370 a time.'</p> <p>Sport is his passion. 'I'm a season-ticket holder at Burnley which is \u00a3320. Plus another \u00a31,000 for away games over the season, including petrol. I love ice hockey and go to see Manchester Storm as often as possible. I go about 25 times in a season, which costs about \u00a3400.'</p> <p>He doesn't save. 'Every now and again I feel guilty about that. I set up a standing order to pay \u00a3350 a month into a high interest savings account. But when I get to \u00a3900 I think: \"Great. That's enough for a skiing holiday.\"' Holidays take a large, regular chunk of his income. 'Three a year, at least. Two skiing trips, which I love, and at least one visit to the US.' The rest goes on socialising and trying to make a dent in his \u00a38,000 Visa bill. </p> <p>Life, Philip believes, is for living. And money is for spending. 'If I had a family, I'd have to behave differently, but I don't, so I don't see that it's a problem. My dad's generation would have scrimped and saved - had half a pint instead of a pint in the pub, or whatever. But where does all that denial and sacrifice get you? An extra 50 quid in the bank when you die.'</p> <p> <b>Nicola Evans (\u00a360,000)</b><br> 31, single, IT service delivery manager, lives in Manchester</p> <p>Nicola Evans's father spent 38 years working for one company - a prospect that seems Jurassically outmoded in her world. At the age of 31, she has already worked for five major companies - in London, in Manchester, and 18 months in Belgium - in her chosen field of information technology. That's the way it works.</p> <p>'I didn't plan this. Every time I join somewhere, I hope that it's going to be forever, but everybody moves around in IT. It's not just about money. I have to love what I do - I've actually taken a pay cut for a job I really wanted.' As well as moving jobs, she travels a lot even when she's settled at one place, and when she's not travelling she puts in long hours. 'It's a work-hard, play-hard life.' It's also an earn-big life - Nicola's salary has bought her a flat in London's Docklands, worth around \u00a3200, which she rents out, and a three-bedroom detached house in Manchester worth \u00a3120k. The rental income in London means that the flat pays for itself. Once she's paid the mortgage on her house, she spends the rest of her monthly salary. </p> <p>'I don't save, apart from the investment in the properties. Not a penny. I just can't.'</p> <p>Nicola is part of a new wave of entirely different householders - the young, affluent single who delay or decide against marriage and family life and buy houses to live in by themselves. Paul Webley has studied attitudes to money across different countries, and he notes that Britain, like the USA, is a very individualistic society. 'In Italy, young people who aren't married tend to stay in the family home. Our singles move out and live by themselves. We're very independent, which has a big effect on the way we live and spend our money in lots of ways.'</p> <p>One effect is that nobody young, single and well off wants to sit in their house by themselves every night. So Nicola goes out. About \u00a3200 per week of her income is spent on socialising. 'I'm out and about five nights a week. I go to bars and restaurants with friends. I spend freely, but I'm not madly extravagant. It galls me to pay more just because the restaurant has a flash name. But then sometimes I'll splash out on a really good bottle of wine.' For her 30th birthday, she hired Old Trafford football club and threw a party for 120 people at \u00a312 a head. 'I just thought - why not?' She's not a label queen - jeans and jumpers are as good at it gets at weekends, but she likes to dress well for work. 'I'll spend up to \u00a3500 on a suit.' </p> <p>Like all high earners, Nicola pays for her time with money. 'I have a lady who does my ironing for \u00a315 a week, and a gardener who costs me \u00a312 a fortnight.' She drives a soft-top Saab - worth about \u00a325,000, which the company buys, but which costs her \u00a36,000 a year in tax, plus 'God knows how much in petrol - I don't even want to think about it.' Most weekends, she drives to London or Bedfordshire, where her family lives. Her other big expense is holidays. 'As many and as often as I can. I'm spending a month in Thailand and Australia at Christmas.' </p> <p>In many ways, it sounds like a model of new economy living. 'In some ways it is, but I can't work at this level, earning this much money, forever. One day I want a family, and then this will have to stop. I'm enjoying it while it lasts. But one of the reasons I'm still single is because of how much I've put into work, and in the end no salary is enough to replace a good relationship and a family.' She knows how hard it will be to downgrade her lifestyle. 'But I've learned from some of the men I work with. They get the big salary and then they get trapped into having to earn at that level. They don't see their kids; their marriages suffer. I don't want it to happen to me.'</p> <p> <b>Paul Gattaora (\u00a3100,000)</b><br> 32, married, headhunter with two children, lives in Buckinghamshire</p> <p>Paul Webley's description of family-centred cultures and their differing attitudes to money is embodied in Paul Gattaora. An Asian man, he spent his childhood weekends and holidays working in his Dad's garage, or in the family shop. 'It taught me discipline and a good work ethic. It's just the Asian way.' He skipped university in favour of 'getting out there into the real world', and had a very successful career in magazine sales before starting his own business - the IT division of Portfolio Recruitment at Stockley Park. 'I got flash out of my system young. </p> <p>I wore the labels and drove the cars, all of that. But I was more or less over it by the time I was in my mid twenties.' These days he spends his money on his family house, where he lives with his wife, children and mother. 'That takes about 50 per cent of my regular income, and I don't mind that at all.'</p> <p>A good chunk of the remaining 50 per cent is also spent on the house. At the moment he's having a conservatory built. 'It's costing about \u00a335,000, without all the finishing off. I've had to order some tiles from France especially.' He never minds, he says, paying for quality. 'Something beautiful, hand-made and one-off? No problem. A great bottle of wine? I'll spend the money with pleasure. What I resent is the \u00a3200 a week we get through in Tesco. Basics in Britain are so overpriced. And don't even get me started on petrol.' The rest of his money goes on clothes - 'I'm not bothered about labels so much, but I have my suits made for work' - and, when he can find the time, on meals out with his wife and family. And, of course, on his pension. 'I've been building that up since I was 21. I've always planned ahead. It will give me a good income from the age of about 50.'</p> <p>Paul works very long hours: '16-hour days are common, and it's pretty much 24/7.' It's for money, of course, but mainly it's for himself. 'I always wanted my own business. I suppose it's in the blood. I'd done well in sales and I turned 30 and thought - right time for me. It's about self-esteem and self-determination.' The financial rewards are high, but he doesn't waste money. 'I don't spoil the kids or buy flash cars - I've got an old Jeep. I won't scrimp on quality, but I know the value of money, and how hard I work for it.' </p> <p>He's playing a long game. 'I don't think anyone could work at this pace and level for too long without keeling over and dying. The plan is to give it my all until I'm 40, make my money, and get out. I'll have paid off the mortgage, got the children sorted out. Then I'll open my own scrap-metal dealership and wear overalls, like my dad. That wouldn't pay me enough to do it now, but that's what I'd love. I'll be the ultimate 21st-century scrap merchant with my own website, selling all around the world!' And he won't miss the big money. 'I'll be fine by then. You should never chase money. If you do, it always eludes you. It has to be a consequence of your work and your life, not your guiding principle.'</p> <p> <b>David Cooper (\u00a31 million)</b><br> 58, married, commercial lawyer with four children and three step-children, lives in London</p> <p>David Cooper is famous for his big income and his enviable lifestyle. Home is a big house in Belgravia. 'It's worth about \u00a38 million. There's no point having a repayment mortgage on that kind of sum, so it's interest only.' The house is decorated with his collection of beautiful antiques, fine rugs and original paintings. He drives an Aston Martin, but there's several other equally juicy motor cars in his collection. His suits are bespoke, his shoes hand-made. There's another flat in Eaton Square. He drinks only good wine, and eats at only the best restaurants.</p> <p>His friends tend to be his clients, rich men like the biotech entrepreneur Chris Evans, or the late Matthew Harding. But he'd rather not talk about all of that. 'Not because I don't like talking about money in the British way, but because I'm bored with it. It's my own fault. I've spent years amusing myself by portraying myself as this big earning lawyer, but the truth is - and I know people won't believe this - I've never really been all that bothered about the money.'</p> <p>I believe him. David Cooper is a totally self-made man, having grown up as a Jewish working-class boy in Manchester. His father was a market stall trader. David was bright, and studied law at Birmingham but, more importantly, he was driven. </p> <p>In his early years, earning big was 'part of the game. I needed to get it just to show that I could and get it out of my system.' But the real point of it all has always been winning. 'I love what I do. I love the competition, and the challenges. I love meeting clients, mixing with all kinds of people. And that is what matters long after you've made all the money.' Paul Webley believes that money is a side issue for the very wealthy. 'There are lots of people with more money than they could spend in several lifetimes, still working as hard as ever. Achievement is a human impulse, and some people just have it to a very great degree.'</p> <p>His salary isn't the whole story. 'I don't think I could actually sustain my current lifestyle on that.' His 'real money' comes from business interests and investments. </p> <p>'I spend most of it on the mortgage and pensions, and over the years on building up the art and antiques collection. But I'm sick of that now. Past a certain point money becomes a burden. I can't go on holiday unless I hire house sitters because of the insurance. So much time is spent maintaining and administrating big sums of money or valuable things. I've lost my spontaneity.' He dreams of downshifting - not from work, which he still loves, but from his fabulous lifestyle. 'I'd rather like a smaller flat in Eaton Square. I'd fill it with Habitat furniture and leave all the doors unlocked. If somebody came and nicked it. I wouldn't care. I'd just buy the whole lot again the next day.'</p> <p>In spite of his wealth, David Cooper would not describe himself as financially secure. 'I am, of course, but that's not the same as feeling it. Every now and again I have a minor anxiety attack. Suppose the bottom fell out of the housing market completely? And if it did, the antiques market would follow suit. And then suppose that inflation ran riot, like in the days of Nazi Germany? It could happen. It's my background. I know that you can never really say: 'this is it. Now I'm safe.'</p> <p>David still insists on value for money. </p> <p>'I wouldn't buy a new, regular car. They're the biggest rip-off imaginable.' And he doesn't care for hotels. 'Almost all of them are overpriced and second-rate.' He can't stand, he says, being taken for a ride. 'I'm not mean. I'm actually rather generous. But I do hate paying \u00a380 for \u00a320 wine.' </p> <p>Having a lot of money isn't enough for a successful life, he insists. 'What's the point of being wealthy if you have no taste? Or if you don't know how to spend it well? It's very important to move in the right circles, and to develop an appreciation of what you can do with money.' In his own circles, he's barely even rich. 'I'm a member at Annabel's nightclub, where the Sultan of Brunei is also a member. I'm probably in the bottom 20 per cent of wealth as far as their member's list goes. But I'm in the top five per cent for popularity, because I can get tickets for Chelsea games.' At the smart, London school his younger children attend, the people he notices who flash the cash openly are 'not old hands like me. It tends to be the 30-something yuppies.'</p> <p>Having lots of money, he says, can enrich your life immeasurably. 'I'm not going to be a hypocrite and say I'd be happier poor.' But, he says, money can only bring happiness if you're in control of it, and not the other way around. 'And I'll tell you something else you won't believe. I'm permanently overdrawn. That's the truth.' </p> <p><b>Net profits</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fool.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">www.fool.co.uk</a><br> Provides a range of information: from experienced investors to people in debt.

I love ice hockey and go to see Manchester Storm as often as possible. I go about 25 times in a season, which costs about \u00a3400.' He doesn't save. 'Every now and again I feel guilty about that. I set up a standing order to pay \u00a3350 a month into a high interest savings account. But when I get to \u00a3900 I think: \"Great. That's enough for a skiing holiday.\"' Holidays take a large, regular chunk of his income. 'Three a year, at least. Two skiing trips, which I love, and at least one visit to the US.' The rest goes on socialising and trying to make a dent in his \u00a38,000 Visa bill. Life, Philip believes, is for living. And money is for spending. 'If I had a family, I'd have to behave differently, but I don't, so I don't see that it's a problem. My dad's generation would have scrimped and saved - had half a pint instead of a pint in the pub, or whatever. But where does all that denial and sacrifice get you? An extra 50 quid in the bank when you die.' Nicola Evans (\u00a360,000) 31, single, IT service delivery manager, lives in Manchester Nicola Evans's father spent 38 years working for one company - a prospect that seems Jurassically outmoded in her world. At the age of 31, she has already worked for five major companies - in London, in Manchester, and 18 months in Belgium - in her chosen field of information technology. That's the way it works. 'I didn't plan this. Every time I join somewhere, I hope that it's going to be forever, but everybody moves around in IT. It's not just about money. I have to love what I do - I've actually taken a pay cut for a job I really wanted.' As well as moving jobs, she travels a lot even when she's settled at one place, and when she's not travelling she puts in long hours. 'It's a work-hard, play-hard life.' It's also an earn-big life - Nicola's salary has bought her a flat in London's Docklands, worth around \u00a3200, which she rents out, and a three-bedroom detached house in Manchester worth \u00a3120k. The rental income in London means that the flat pays for itself. Once she's paid the mortgage on her house, she spends the rest of her monthly salary. 'I don't save, apart from the investment in the properties. Not a penny. I just can't.' Nicola is part of a new wave of entirely different householders - the young, affluent single who delay or decide against marriage and family life and buy houses to live in by themselves. Paul Webley has studied attitudes to money across different countries, and he notes that Britain, like the USA, is a very individualistic society. 'In Italy, young people who aren't married tend to stay in the family home. Our singles move out and live by themselves. We're very independent, which has a big effect on the way we live and spend our money in lots of ways.' One effect is that nobody young, single and well off wants to sit in their house by themselves every night. So Nicola goes out. About \u00a3200 per week of her income is spent on socialising. 'I'm out and about five nights a week. I go to bars and restaurants with friends. I spend freely, but I'm not madly extravagant. It galls me to pay more just because the restaurant has a flash name. But then sometimes I'll splash out on a really good bottle of wine.' For her 30th birthday, she hired Old Trafford football club and threw a party for 120 people at \u00a312 a head. 'I just thought - why not?' She's not a label queen - jeans and jumpers are as good at it gets at weekends, but she likes to dress well for work. 'I'll spend up to \u00a3500 on a suit.' Like all high earners, Nicola pays for her time with money. 'I have a lady who does my ironing for \u00a315 a week, and a gardener who costs me \u00a312 a fortnight.' She drives a soft-top Saab - worth about \u00a325,000, which the company buys, but which costs her \u00a36,000 a year in tax, plus 'God knows how much in petrol - I don't even want to think about it.' Most weekends, she drives to London or Bedfordshire, where her family lives. Her other big expense is holidays. 'As many and as often as I can. I'm spending a month in Thailand and Australia at Christmas.' In many ways, it sounds like a model of new economy living. 'In some ways it is, but I can't work at this level, earning this much money, forever. One day I want a family, and then this will have to stop. I'm enjoying it while it lasts. But one of the reasons I'm still single is because of how much I've put into work, and in the end no salary is enough to replace a good relationship and a family.' She knows how hard it will be to downgrade her lifestyle. 'But I've learned from some of the men I work with. They get the big salary and then they get trapped into having to earn at that level. They don't see their kids; their marriages suffer. I don't want it to happen to me.' Paul Gattaora (\u00a3100,000) 32, married, headhunter with two children, lives in Buckinghamshire Paul Webley's description of family-centred cultures and their differing attitudes to money is embodied in Paul Gattaora. An Asian man, he spent his childhood weekends and holidays working in his Dad's garage, or in the family shop. 'It taught me discipline and a good work ethic. It's just the Asian way.' He skipped university in favour of 'getting out there into the real world', and had a very successful career in magazine sales before starting his own business - the IT division of Portfolio Recruitment at Stockley Park. 'I got flash out of my system young. I wore the labels and drove the cars, all of that. But I was more or less over it by the time I was in my mid twenties.' These days he spends his money on his family house, where he lives with his wife, children and mother. 'That takes about 50 per cent of my regular income, and I don't mind that at all.' A good chunk of the remaining 50 per cent is also spent on the house. At the moment he's having a conservatory built. 'It's costing about \u00a335,000, without all the finishing off. I've had to order some tiles from France especially.' He never minds, he says, paying for quality. 'Something beautiful, hand-made and one-off? No problem. A great bottle of wine? I'll spend the money with pleasure. What I resent is the \u00a3200 a week we get through in Tesco. Basics in Britain are so overpriced. And don't even get me started on petrol.' The rest of his money goes on clothes - 'I'm not bothered about labels so much, but I have my suits made for work' - and, when he can find the time, on meals out with his wife and family. And, of course, on his pension. 'I've been building that up since I was 21. I've always planned ahead. It will give me a good income from the age of about 50.' Paul works very long hours: '16-hour days are common, and it's pretty much 24/7.' It's for money, of course, but mainly it's for himself. 'I always wanted my own business. I suppose it's in the blood. I'd done well in sales and I turned 30 and thought - right time for me. It's about self-esteem and self-determination.' The financial rewards are high, but he doesn't waste money. 'I don't spoil the kids or buy flash cars - I've got an old Jeep. I won't scrimp on quality, but I know the value of money, and how hard I work for it.' He's playing a long game. 'I don't think anyone could work at this pace and level for too long without keeling over and dying. The plan is to give it my all until I'm 40, make my money, and get out. I'll have paid off the mortgage, got the children sorted out. Then I'll open my own scrap-metal dealership and wear overalls, like my dad. That wouldn't pay me enough to do it now, but that's what I'd love. I'll be the ultimate 21st-century scrap merchant with my own website, selling all around the world!' And he won't miss the big money. 'I'll be fine by then. You should never chase money. If you do, it always eludes you. It has to be a consequence of your work and your life, not your guiding principle.' David Cooper (\u00a31 million) 58, married, commercial lawyer with four children and three step-children, lives in London David Cooper is famous for his big income and his enviable lifestyle. Home is a big house in Belgravia. 'It's worth about \u00a38 million. There's no point having a repayment mortgage on that kind of sum, so it's interest only.' The house is decorated with his collection of beautiful antiques, fine rugs and original paintings. He drives an Aston Martin, but there's several other equally juicy motor cars in his collection. His suits are bespoke, his shoes hand-made. There's another flat in Eaton Square. He drinks only good wine, and eats at only the best restaurants. His friends tend to be his clients, rich men like the biotech entrepreneur Chris Evans, or the late Matthew Harding. But he'd rather not talk about all of that. 'Not because I don't like talking about money in the British way, but because I'm bored with it. It's my own fault. I've spent years amusing myself by portraying myself as this big earning lawyer, but the truth is - and I know people won't believe this - I've never really been all that bothered about the money.' I believe him. David Cooper is a totally self-made man, having grown up as a Jewish working-class boy in Manchester. His father was a market stall trader. David was bright, and studied law at Birmingham but, more importantly, he was driven. In his early years, earning big was 'part of the game. I needed to get it just to show that I could and get it out of my system.' But the real point of it all has always been winning. 'I love what I do. I love the competition, and the challenges. I love meeting clients, mixing with all kinds of people. And that is what matters long after you've made all the money.' Paul Webley believes that money is a side issue for the very wealthy. 'There are lots of people with more money than they could spend in several lifetimes, still working as hard as ever. Achievement is a human impulse, and some people just have it to a very great degree.' His salary isn't the whole story. 'I don't think I could actually sustain my current lifestyle on that.' His 'real money' comes from business interests and investments. 'I spend most of it on the mortgage and pensions, and over the years on building up the art and antiques collection. But I'm sick of that now. Past a certain point money becomes a burden. I can't go on holiday unless I hire house sitters because of the insurance. So much time is spent maintaining and administrating big sums of money or valuable things. I've lost my spontaneity.' He dreams of downshifting - not from work, which he still loves, but from his fabulous lifestyle. 'I'd rather like a smaller flat in Eaton Square. I'd fill it with Habitat furniture and leave all the doors unlocked. If somebody came and nicked it. I wouldn't care. I'd just buy the whole lot again the next day.' In spite of his wealth, David Cooper would not describe himself as financially secure. 'I am, of course, but that's not the same as feeling it. Every now and again I have a minor anxiety attack. Suppose the bottom fell out of the housing market completely? And if it did, the antiques market would follow suit. And then suppose that inflation ran riot, like in the days of Nazi Germany? It could happen. It's my background. I know that you can never really say: 'this is it. Now I'm safe.' David still insists on value for money. 'I wouldn't buy a new, regular car. They're the biggest rip-off imaginable.' And he doesn't care for hotels. 'Almost all of them are overpriced and second-rate.' He can't stand, he says, being taken for a ride. 'I'm not mean. I'm actually rather generous. But I do hate paying \u00a380 for \u00a320 wine.' Having a lot of money isn't enough for a successful life, he insists. 'What's the point of being wealthy if you have no taste? Or if you don't know how to spend it well? It's very important to move in the right circles, and to develop an appreciation of what you can do with money.' In his own circles, he's barely even rich. 'I'm a member at Annabel's nightclub, where the Sultan of Brunei is also a member. I'm probably in the bottom 20 per cent of wealth as far as their member's list goes. But I'm in the top five per cent for popularity, because I can get tickets for Chelsea games.' At the smart, London school his younger children attend, the people he notices who flash the cash openly are 'not old hands like me. It tends to be the 30-something yuppies.' Having lots of money, he says, can enrich your life immeasurably. 'I'm not going to be a hypocrite and say I'd be happier poor.' But, he says, money can only bring happiness if you're in control of it, and not the other way around. 'And I'll tell you something else you won't believe. I'm permanently overdrawn.

      "body": "<p>In October 1991, the pop charts were awash with cheesy rave anthems based on themes from popular TV shows. Most would be forgotten the moment they spluttered out of the Top 40, but, even at the time, 'Go' seemed different. It was artfully constructed around the looming signature chords from David Lynch's Twin Peaks series, and on Top of the Pops its author threw himself about like a small, white, bald maniac. Soon a disbelieving music press was reporting on this vegan, Christian, teetotal, car-hating New York raver with intense eyes that betrayed such a disquieting mix of challenge and apology. Over the next three years, a string of euphoric hit singles followed. Then things got really strange.</p> <p>Moby's friends will tell you that he lives in the same spartan Manhattan apartment as he did when he made 'Go'. He will tell you that he lives in his tour bus, because when his current travels end in December, he and his party will have been on the road for 21 consecutive months - during which time the material circumstances of his life have altered little, but the context has changed beyond all recognition. When he set out, Moby was considered yesterday's man, a talented musician with a penchant for aggravating others and shooting himself in the foot. When he released his latest album, Play, in May last year, the reviews were grudgingly favourable, but small. The US record labels which had turned him down seemed vindicated: Mute, the British independent which is his real home, watched as Play 'flatlined', shifting a meagre 10,000 copies in six months.</p> <p>A year on, Play has sold more than 5 million, going platinum in 17 countries and topping the charts in seven. Few Britons will get through an entire day without hearing at least one piece of Moby music, as he finds himself re-cast as the world's pop star du jour, a phenomenon he likes to refer to as 'obviously a clerical error'. More peculiar still, we should find this comforting. For his is an extraordinary story.</p> <p>Moby looks fit and fresh, but his mostly Brit crew look worn. 'Did you bring any British newspapers with you?' they ask with a hint of desperation as you're introduced backstage at the soon-to-be-rammed Bronco Bowl in Dallas, Texas. For the past few months, he's been treating his audience to some thoughts on the desirability of voting Al Gore for President, but this is very definitely George W Bush country, and last night in Houston, he forgot. I wonder whether this might have been an unconscious survival instinct, and Moby smiles and leads me to his preferred lair at the rear of his massive bronze bus. I'll be amused to note that he 'forgets' tonight, too.</p> <p>We've met before over the years, and I find him little changed on the surface: the same bald head and alert but strangely neutral features. He's always been good company, talking fast, listening well, engaging in conversation with the whole of his being, ever straining to reach the essence of whatever it is you're talking about, even if it's only tape recorders or socks. He's 35 now and claims to have gradually retreated from his formerly dogmatic approach to life and morality. These days, he even gets pissed sometimes. He's relaxed. He's having fun. I was recently with some musicians who complain bitterly about touring the way he is. I ask how he finds the experience.</p> <p>'I love touring because you never really get bored, and if you do get bored, your circumstances are always changing. Even a lot of the little irritants are addictive. Like, the other day, on our way from Albuquerque to Houston, we had a day off in Wichita Falls, Texas, which is officially the middle of nowhere. So you find yourselves walking through desolate places. And especially out west, America is full of them. There's so much space and so few people. Just standing in a parking lot in the middle of nowhere with a warm breeze blowing. You understand why film-makers are so drawn to making movies about the West - the weird guy sitting behind the counter selling cigars, the old lady on the porch\u0085 I love it.'</p> <p>The name began as a kind of joke, almost from the moment Richard Hall was born. He was so small, so frail, that calling him after the fictional scion of his great-great-great grandfather, Herman Melville, seemed to carry hope, to provide a kind of grand raft for the little boy to cling to. His father, an academic chemist, died in a car crash when his son was two, and his mother, Elizabeth, was a hippy artist who smoked pot and hung out with musicians and struggled, with the help of welfare, food stamps, social security, to make ends meet. Both sets of grandparents were wealthy - mother and son were never going to starve - but in the affluent hamlet of Darien, Connecticut, only 15 minutes distant from the neighbourhood Moby's pal Rick Moody was writing about in his novel/film The Ice Storm, they were apart, other.</p> <p>'The more I travel and see, the more I realise how conventional my upbringing was. But at the time, all my friends seemed to have stable, traditional, affluent homes. Now it turns out that lots of Americans were raised under similar circumstances to me, the difference being that they grew up in communities where everyone had messed-up home lives. I had new clothes, but from bargain shops, not Adidas and Levi's like my peers, and I'm sure a lot of people can relate to the sense of inadequacy that gives you. There was this sense of wanting to fit in and not fitting in, even if it was by no means unique to me. Every time I left the house, I was aware of those feelings.'</p> <p>In retrospect, there were silver linings. The number of pop stars who had hippy parents is high: Beck, PJ Harvey and Jarvis Cocker being but three obvious examples (Moby has noticed this, too). A beardy, bead-wearing friend of Elizabeth's tutored the 13-year-old boy in classical guitar and jazz theory. Through examining his mother's book collection, he came to realise that 'most of the heroes of the 20th century had made a virtue of feeling inadequate or displaced'. He read Rambeau, Faulkner and Bukowski ('not my favourite writer, but\u0085') and felt better. He went to study philosophy at Connecticut University, then transferred to New York, where he was disappointed by the inconsequentiality of the syllabus and directed most of his energy towards music. He played guitar with the punky Vatican Commandos and Flipper before graduating to the briefly wonderful New York psychedelicists Ultra Vivid Scene. Then he left for the visceral joys of rave.</p> <p>He'd picked up his Christianity while at school, but dates the rigidity that came to characterise it from the punk period. He can laugh at it now. 'It lasted till 1996 - from the ages of 16 to 30, basically, which is a long time. First I was a rigid punk-rock Marxist. Then I was a rigid vegan dance-music Christian guy\u0085'</p> <p>And what ended those things, I ask.</p> <p>'Empiricism. Going out and looking at the world and realising that fixed orthodoxies make sense on the printed page and in your head when your eyes are closed and you're going to sleep, but they don't make sense when you walk around and look at the world.' What did he want from the doctrines?</p> <p>'Very simply, what I think motivates people to want to hold on to rigid orthodoxies is the simple desire to see the world as a simple, understandable place. The only epiphany I ever had was being able to say that the world is not a simple and understandable place and people who try to make it so are... jerks. They're unpleasant, and no one wants to hang out with them. They're fundamentalists. That's why the first essay in the Play sleeve is specifically about that. What I found was that people were looking to me to be a rigid vegan fundamentalist or dance fundamentalist or Christian fundamentalist, and I find that to be distasteful.'</p> <p>Is he simply saying that Ewan McGregor won't hang with you if you have convictions? 'No. I think those beliefs and ways of living are erroneous as well. The thing is that I was proved wrong so many times that to try and insist that I know better than everyone else is just stupid.'</p> <p>So the end of ideology has worked for Moby, just like the rest of us. Actually, more than the rest of us. Noticing with humility yet an unmistakable frisson of glee that women fancy famous blokes, he has used the belated realisation that his old semi-celibacy was 'erroneous' as a springboard to discovery. Remembering that when Moby goes for something, he really goes for it, you can't help but feel pleased for him. There was the reported romance with Star Wars actress Natalie Portman, a toe dipped into the world of a dominatrix, the games of 'touch knob' (don't even ask) at celebrity parties, even the tawdry affairs of rock'n'roll legend.</p> <p>His most recent foray into the world of Big Celebrity was attending US R'n'B \u00fcbermeister Sean 'Puffy' Combs's lavish ball in the Hamptons. There's a rare grin on Moby's face as he recounts this.</p> <p>'I went mainly to see what it was like - I mean, that sort of ostentation. So you get there and it's this huge house right on the ocean. And his driveway is filled with Bentleys and Mercedes and Porsches and Jaguars\u0085 it's interesting. I can't judge that kind of consumerism, because I don't come from the same kind of cultural place that he comes from, but it was the weirdest mix.</p> <p>I mean, the Hamptons is horrifying. Really horrifying. It's so much money, so much wealth, so much opulence. You go to these parties and its basically just people figuring out what they can get from each other.</p> <p>'So the interesting thing about Puffy's party is that he wants to be part of that, so he'll go to the Hamptons' invitational polo matches, meaning that half the people at the party were moneyed old conservative WASPs, and the other half were homeboys who he grew up with, people from his record company, Bad Boy. And Salman Rushdie and members of boy bands. And everyone had to wear all white, so it was almost as though you couldn't tell who was who. Leo DiCaprio was turned away because he wasn't wearing white. He had to go buy something! The whole thing was just\u0085 interesting.</p> <p>'What I've come to understand is that indulgence can lead to epiphanies more times that abstinence,' he declares. 'My old quasi-celibacy is a good example. I was celibate for the wrong reasons. I was celibate for the same reasons as I was a vegan and didn't drink - because it made me feel superior.'</p> <p>It seems to me that Moby's being a little hard on himself here. The need to place himself beyond criticism surely stemmed from an underlying feeling that he deserved criticism. I suggest this, but he's having none of it.</p> <p>'Well, I could have been criticised for being a rigid, uptight asshole. And then I found myself suddenly being drunk and occasionally having tawdry one-night stands and affairs. And at times it was wonderful, at times sordid and dumb. But it didn't fit any generalisations, and that was the lesson.'</p> <p>At this juncture, I find myself wondering how Moby defines his Christianity these days. He has a problem with that title, he explains, because he thinks it implies self-righteousness. He became a lover of Christ ('in the Platonic sense,' he giggles) when he came across the Gospel according to Matthew at school, which 'just struck me as right'. Soon, church and Bible studies became a refuge from the alienation he felt elsewhere, fitting neatly into the strictured universe he was trying to construct for himself. In his newly chilled mode, he aspires to live according to the teachings of Christ, he says, adding as a casual rejoinder, 'at least some of them, because unfortunately, I have to be a bit selective'.</p> <p>Intriguingly, Moby's personal and musical evolution has mirrored, and in many respects presaged, developments within British culture during the 90s. Just as political ideology appeared to wither away in those years, so did the tribes and factions that had always defined pop culture. Someone once noted that Britain was the only country in the world where someone might ask, 'So what's he like?' and be told, 'Oh, he's a skinhead.'</p> <p>By the decade's end, the style tribes had dissolved, but when Moby released his debut album, Everything is Wrong, in 1995, minds had not yet been fully prised open. This was a couple of years before the Prodigy, Fatboy Slim or Tony Blair and when Moby, with his outsider's disregard for political or aesthetic correctness, released Everything is Wrong, which veered between swirling club anthems, punk thrashes and ambient torch music, it was met mostly with a mixture of disbelief and consternation. Some excited new listeners were won, but at the expense of fashionability: Moby was ahead of his time. Then, a year later, he tested his audience to destruction with a furious, hardcore punk album, Animal Rights, which very few people bought outside of Greece and Germany.</p> <p>Shortly after its release, his mother was diagnosed with cancer and died in 1998, at the age of 54. A friend has referred to this period as Moby's 'dark night of the soul', and he has wondered at the conjunction of that truculent record and his mother's illness.</p> <p>'You hear stories of farm animals getting jittery and running around before earthquakes,' he says. 'Maybe I was anticipating something.'</p> <p>In the event, what followed bore no relation to what anyone expected. Moby scrapped early sessions for a new album, spooked by the vivid rock/dance crossover success of the Prodigy's Fat of the Land. 'It got very distressing, going to expensive recording studios and continually coming out with results I hated,' he confessed shortly afterwards. 'In the end, I went back to my bedroom and made an album full of flaws, quirks and brilliant idiosyncrasies.'</p> <p>The turning point came when he stumbled across a series of recordings made by a couple of amateur American folk-music archivists named John and Alan Lomax. In the 30s, this father-and-son team had toured the South with a primitive 300lb tape recorder in the boot of their car, recording for posterity the gospel and blues sounds they heard at a time when no one else was. Moby found them inspirational and began to experiment with sampling segments of performance by the likes of the Shining Light Gospel Choir, Boy Blue, Bill Landford &amp; The Landfordaires and Bessie Smith, re-situating them in his modern electronic arrangements. It is tribute to the sensitivity with which he did this that tunes such as the now uniquitous breakthrough single 'Natural Blues' and the rippling 'Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?' sound as soulful as they do.</p> <p>Interspersed with the usual eclectic and emotive range of his original compositions, they came to form the spine of Play. And that's why we're here.</p> <p>Some people are asking whether Moby has relaxed his standards too much. As Play has grown in popularity, so have allegations that making money out of the mostly impoverished black artists recorded by the Lomaxes amounts to nothing more nor less than exploitation. Moby's heard the arguments and treats the issue gingerly, pointing out that his motives were sound; he never expected Play to be successful and has tried to make sure that the money generated has gone to the right people.

He suggests that in the future we will be purchasing experiences rather than ownership and that this form of exchange will seep into every area of our lives ('We're moving from commodifying goods and services to commodifying culture').

      "bodyText": "In October 1991, the pop charts were awash with cheesy rave anthems based on themes from popular TV shows. Most would be forgotten the moment they spluttered out of the Top 40, but, even at the time, 'Go' seemed different. It was artfully constructed around the looming signature chords from David Lynch's Twin Peaks series, and on Top of the Pops its author threw himself about like a small, white, bald maniac. Soon a disbelieving music press was reporting on this vegan, Christian, teetotal, car-hating New York raver with intense eyes that betrayed such a disquieting mix of challenge and apology. Over the next three years, a string of euphoric hit singles followed. Then things got really strange. Moby's friends will tell you that he lives in the same spartan Manhattan apartment as he did when he made 'Go'. He will tell you that he lives in his tour bus, because when his current travels end in December, he and his party will have been on the road for 21 consecutive months - during which time the material circumstances of his life have altered little, but the context has changed beyond all recognition. When he set out, Moby was considered yesterday's man, a talented musician with a penchant for aggravating others and shooting himself in the foot. When he released his latest album, Play, in May last year, the reviews were grudgingly favourable, but small. The US record labels which had turned him down seemed vindicated: Mute, the British independent which is his real home, watched as Play 'flatlined', shifting a meagre 10,000 copies in six months. A year on, Play has sold more than 5 million, going platinum in 17 countries and topping the charts in seven. Few Britons will get through an entire day without hearing at least one piece of Moby music, as he finds himself re-cast as the world's pop star du jour, a phenomenon he likes to refer to as 'obviously a clerical error'. More peculiar still, we should find this comforting. For his is an extraordinary story. Moby looks fit and fresh, but his mostly Brit crew look worn. 'Did you bring any British newspapers with you?' they ask with a hint of desperation as you're introduced backstage at the soon-to-be-rammed Bronco Bowl in Dallas, Texas. For the past few months, he's been treating his audience to some thoughts on the desirability of voting Al Gore for President, but this is very definitely George W Bush country, and last night in Houston, he forgot. I wonder whether this might have been an unconscious survival instinct, and Moby smiles and leads me to his preferred lair at the rear of his massive bronze bus. I'll be amused to note that he 'forgets' tonight, too. We've met before over the years, and I find him little changed on the surface: the same bald head and alert but strangely neutral features. He's always been good company, talking fast, listening well, engaging in conversation with the whole of his being, ever straining to reach the essence of whatever it is you're talking about, even if it's only tape recorders or socks. He's 35 now and claims to have gradually retreated from his formerly dogmatic approach to life and morality. These days, he even gets pissed sometimes. He's relaxed. He's having fun. I was recently with some musicians who complain bitterly about touring the way he is. I ask how he finds the experience. 'I love touring because you never really get bored, and if you do get bored, your circumstances are always changing. Even a lot of the little irritants are addictive. Like, the other day, on our way from Albuquerque to Houston, we had a day off in Wichita Falls, Texas, which is officially the middle of nowhere. So you find yourselves walking through desolate places. And especially out west, America is full of them. There's so much space and so few people. Just standing in a parking lot in the middle of nowhere with a warm breeze blowing. You understand why film-makers are so drawn to making movies about the West - the weird guy sitting behind the counter selling cigars, the old lady on the porch\u0085 I love it.' The name began as a kind of joke, almost from the moment Richard Hall was born. He was so small, so frail, that calling him after the fictional scion of his great-great-great grandfather, Herman Melville, seemed to carry hope, to provide a kind of grand raft for the little boy to cling to. His father, an academic chemist, died in a car crash when his son was two, and his mother, Elizabeth, was a hippy artist who smoked pot and hung out with musicians and struggled, with the help of welfare, food stamps, social security, to make ends meet. Both sets of grandparents were wealthy - mother and son were never going to starve - but in the affluent hamlet of Darien, Connecticut, only 15 minutes distant from the neighbourhood Moby's pal Rick Moody was writing about in his novel/film The Ice Storm, they were apart, other. 'The more I travel and see, the more I realise how conventional my upbringing was. But at the time, all my friends seemed to have stable, traditional, affluent homes. Now it turns out that lots of Americans were raised under similar circumstances to me, the difference being that they grew up in communities where everyone had messed-up home lives. I had new clothes, but from bargain shops, not Adidas and Levi's like my peers, and I'm sure a lot of people can relate to the sense of inadequacy that gives you. There was this sense of wanting to fit in and not fitting in, even if it was by no means unique to me. Every time I left the house, I was aware of those feelings.' In retrospect, there were silver linings. The number of pop stars who had hippy parents is high: Beck, PJ Harvey and Jarvis Cocker being but three obvious examples (Moby has noticed this, too). A beardy, bead-wearing friend of Elizabeth's tutored the 13-year-old boy in classical guitar and jazz theory. Through examining his mother's book collection, he came to realise that 'most of the heroes of the 20th century had made a virtue of feeling inadequate or displaced'. He read Rambeau, Faulkner and Bukowski ('not my favourite writer, but\u0085') and felt better. He went to study philosophy at Connecticut University, then transferred to New York, where he was disappointed by the inconsequentiality of the syllabus and directed most of his energy towards music. He played guitar with the punky Vatican Commandos and Flipper before graduating to the briefly wonderful New York psychedelicists Ultra Vivid Scene. Then he left for the visceral joys of rave. He'd picked up his Christianity while at school, but dates the rigidity that came to characterise it from the punk period. He can laugh at it now. 'It lasted till 1996 - from the ages of 16 to 30, basically, which is a long time. First I was a rigid punk-rock Marxist. Then I was a rigid vegan dance-music Christian guy\u0085' And what ended those things, I ask. 'Empiricism. Going out and looking at the world and realising that fixed orthodoxies make sense on the printed page and in your head when your eyes are closed and you're going to sleep, but they don't make sense when you walk around and look at the world.' What did he want from the doctrines? 'Very simply, what I think motivates people to want to hold on to rigid orthodoxies is the simple desire to see the world as a simple, understandable place. The only epiphany I ever had was being able to say that the world is not a simple and understandable place and people who try to make it so are... jerks. They're unpleasant, and no one wants to hang out with them. They're fundamentalists. That's why the first essay in the Play sleeve is specifically about that. What I found was that people were looking to me to be a rigid vegan fundamentalist or dance fundamentalist or Christian fundamentalist, and I find that to be distasteful.' Is he simply saying that Ewan McGregor won't hang with you if you have convictions? 'No. I think those beliefs and ways of living are erroneous as well. The thing is that I was proved wrong so many times that to try and insist that I know better than everyone else is just stupid.' So the end of ideology has worked for Moby, just like the rest of us. Actually, more than the rest of us. Noticing with humility yet an unmistakable frisson of glee that women fancy famous blokes, he has used the belated realisation that his old semi-celibacy was 'erroneous' as a springboard to discovery. Remembering that when Moby goes for something, he really goes for it, you can't help but feel pleased for him. There was the reported romance with Star Wars actress Natalie Portman, a toe dipped into the world of a dominatrix, the games of 'touch knob' (don't even ask) at celebrity parties, even the tawdry affairs of rock'n'roll legend. His most recent foray into the world of Big Celebrity was attending US R'n'B \u00fcbermeister Sean 'Puffy' Combs's lavish ball in the Hamptons. There's a rare grin on Moby's face as he recounts this. 'I went mainly to see what it was like - I mean, that sort of ostentation. So you get there and it's this huge house right on the ocean. And his driveway is filled with Bentleys and Mercedes and Porsches and Jaguars\u0085 it's interesting. I can't judge that kind of consumerism, because I don't come from the same kind of cultural place that he comes from, but it was the weirdest mix. I mean, the Hamptons is horrifying. Really horrifying. It's so much money, so much wealth, so much opulence. You go to these parties and its basically just people figuring out what they can get from each other. 'So the interesting thing about Puffy's party is that he wants to be part of that, so he'll go to the Hamptons' invitational polo matches, meaning that half the people at the party were moneyed old conservative WASPs, and the other half were homeboys who he grew up with, people from his record company, Bad Boy. And Salman Rushdie and members of boy bands. And everyone had to wear all white, so it was almost as though you couldn't tell who was who. Leo DiCaprio was turned away because he wasn't wearing white. He had to go buy something! The whole thing was just\u0085 interesting. 'What I've come to understand is that indulgence can lead to epiphanies more times that abstinence,' he declares. 'My old quasi-celibacy is a good example. I was celibate for the wrong reasons. I was celibate for the same reasons as I was a vegan and didn't drink - because it made me feel superior.' It seems to me that Moby's being a little hard on himself here. The need to place himself beyond criticism surely stemmed from an underlying feeling that he deserved criticism. I suggest this, but he's having none of it. 'Well, I could have been criticised for being a rigid, uptight asshole. And then I found myself suddenly being drunk and occasionally having tawdry one-night stands and affairs. And at times it was wonderful, at times sordid and dumb. But it didn't fit any generalisations, and that was the lesson.' At this juncture, I find myself wondering how Moby defines his Christianity these days. He has a problem with that title, he explains, because he thinks it implies self-righteousness. He became a lover of Christ ('in the Platonic sense,' he giggles) when he came across the Gospel according to Matthew at school, which 'just struck me as right'. Soon, church and Bible studies became a refuge from the alienation he felt elsewhere, fitting neatly into the strictured universe he was trying to construct for himself. In his newly chilled mode, he aspires to live according to the teachings of Christ, he says, adding as a casual rejoinder, 'at least some of them, because unfortunately, I have to be a bit selective'. Intriguingly, Moby's personal and musical evolution has mirrored, and in many respects presaged, developments within British culture during the 90s. Just as political ideology appeared to wither away in those years, so did the tribes and factions that had always defined pop culture. Someone once noted that Britain was the only country in the world where someone might ask, 'So what's he like?' and be told, 'Oh, he's a skinhead.' By the decade's end, the style tribes had dissolved, but when Moby released his debut album, Everything is Wrong, in 1995, minds had not yet been fully prised open. This was a couple of years before the Prodigy, Fatboy Slim or Tony Blair and when Moby, with his outsider's disregard for political or aesthetic correctness, released Everything is Wrong, which veered between swirling club anthems, punk thrashes and ambient torch music, it was met mostly with a mixture of disbelief and consternation. Some excited new listeners were won, but at the expense of fashionability: Moby was ahead of his time. Then, a year later, he tested his audience to destruction with a furious, hardcore punk album, Animal Rights, which very few people bought outside of Greece and Germany. Shortly after its release, his mother was diagnosed with cancer and died in 1998, at the age of 54. A friend has referred to this period as Moby's 'dark night of the soul', and he has wondered at the conjunction of that truculent record and his mother's illness. 'You hear stories of farm animals getting jittery and running around before earthquakes,' he says. 'Maybe I was anticipating something.' In the event, what followed bore no relation to what anyone expected. Moby scrapped early sessions for a new album, spooked by the vivid rock/dance crossover success of the Prodigy's Fat of the Land. 'It got very distressing, going to expensive recording studios and continually coming out with results I hated,' he confessed shortly afterwards. 'In the end, I went back to my bedroom and made an album full of flaws, quirks and brilliant idiosyncrasies.' The turning point came when he stumbled across a series of recordings made by a couple of amateur American folk-music archivists named John and Alan Lomax. In the 30s, this father-and-son team had toured the South with a primitive 300lb tape recorder in the boot of their car, recording for posterity the gospel and blues sounds they heard at a time when no one else was. Moby found them inspirational and began to experiment with sampling segments of performance by the likes of the Shining Light Gospel Choir, Boy Blue, Bill Landford &amp; The Landfordaires and Bessie Smith, re-situating them in his modern electronic arrangements. It is tribute to the sensitivity with which he did this that tunes such as the now uniquitous breakthrough single 'Natural Blues' and the rippling 'Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?' sound as soulful as they do. Interspersed with the usual eclectic and emotive range of his original compositions, they came to form the spine of Play. And that's why we're here. Some people are asking whether Moby has relaxed his standards too much. As Play has grown in popularity, so have allegations that making money out of the mostly impoverished black artists recorded by the Lomaxes amounts to nothing more nor less than exploitation. Moby's heard the arguments and treats the issue gingerly, pointing out that his motives were sound; he never expected Play to be successful and has tried to make sure that the money generated has gone to the right people. He further posits 'collage and assemblage' as 'one of the dominant creative motifs of the 20th century', adding that most of the compositional elements are generated by him. He is right on all counts, but on the plane to Texas, I came across a more sophisticated argument, which could be seen as applying to modern dance music generally. Boiled down to essentials, the American business academic Jeremy Rifkin claims in a new book that the days of the property-based capitalist economy are numbered. Companies such as Nike, he notes, own little other than a concept, a lifestyle, and more and more people are leasing large items like cars in preference to buying. He suggests that in the future we will be purchasing experiences rather than ownership and that this form of exchange will seep into every area of our lives ('We're moving from commodifying goods and services to commodifying culture'). He claims fusion music is a good example of this process: corporations scour the globe for culture to mine, just as their precursors mined copper or coal. In the process, they tear them from their roots. 'When you take a culture and homogenise it, transform it, package it and sell it back to people as paid-for experience, then it is just as possible to deplete cultural diversity as bio-diversity,' Rifkin concludes. Dance music has been doing this, or something very like it, for years. Moby comes to terms with the thesis with impressive speed, but takes a moment to work out what he thinks about it. 'When I hear people saying stuff like that, I want to sit them down and give them some nice warm soya milk and cookies and tell them everything's going to be OK. I want to tell them, \"Just because we don't fully understand the complexities of the contemporary world doesn't mean that it's wrong or on the brink of collapse.\" You know, this idea that to remove something from its original context is contrary to contemporary life\u0085 everything is removed from its original context.

Worth \u00a320bn and trading at a discount to its peers, Texaco is one of the few attractive targets left in the industry. However, an intervention by Shell would lead to fears of closure at the huge Texaco refinery at Milford Haven, the mainstay of the south-west Wales economy. The sector has seen a whirlwind of deals, prompted by the previously low oil price, over recent years. First BP merged with Amoco, then it took over smaller US rival Atlantic Richfield (Arco). Then Exxon swallowed Mobil to reclaim the number one slot. Last year, too, French and Belgian groups Elf and Totalfina merged to create the number four behind Shell. Recently, Chevron was understood to be in exploratory talks with Phillips, a smaller US rival. The main attraction of Texaco , however, is that both are involved in Caltex, a successful refining and petrol station joint venture in Asia Pacific, Africa and the Middle East.",

      "body": "<p>When Sean Hayes won an Emmy for his role in American TV's Will &amp; Grace, it signalled more than the show's rise to the top tier of US network programmes. Hayes's win, for his hilarious portrayal of the flamboyantly funny Jack McFarland, was an actor standing out - and standing up for the gay community.</p> <p>NBC's Will &amp; Grace - a sitcom about a gay man - happened to be the most nominated comedy at the Emmys. The same Emmys where Vanessa Redgrave won for her portrayal of an ageing lesbian in If These Walls Could Talk 2.</p> <p>And 22 million viewers didn't bat an eyelid. As Entertainment Weekly noted, 'Nobody cared. And that's because today, gay characters are so common on television, so unexotic, that their sexual orientation has become all but invisible to viewers.' David Kohan, the creator of Will &amp; Grace said, 'That's how far we've come. The question networks used to ask was whether their shows had too many episodes with gay plotlines in them. Today, they ask whether they have too many gay shows.'</p> <p>It's a mark of the ordinariness of these shows that Will &amp; Grace has been moved to NBC's prime weekly slot, Thursday at 9pm, replacing Frasier. And coming soon from Fox Television, Normal Ohio, a sitcom starring John Goodman as a divorced gay dad. Not to be outdone, CBS is working on two gay-related TV shows.</p> <p>And it's not just shows, the number of gay characters on TV has increased exponentially, both in numbers and type - US viewers can now see gay killers, gay students, gay TV executives, gay TV doctors, gay teens and even, on South Park, gay cartoon dogs.</p> <p>This year has been a major one for gays and lesbians,' says Nick Adams, entertainment media manager of the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD).</p> <p>Adams traces a shift in the business. 'As gay-themed films continue to make money, it gets easier to get more made. Hollywood operates on a profitablity basis, obviously, so the more successful films with gay themes, the better.' But, he adds, all this 'doesn't change the fact that in 39 states, people can still be fired for being gay.'</p> <p>However, being gay - or at least, playing gay - is no longer unusual on American screens. Just ask the winner of Survivor, Richard Hatch, who walked into America's living rooms every week, let it all hang out, and walked away a millionaire.</p> <p>Hatch, 39, never hid his homosexuality, and it caused some of the most colourful exchanges with his fellow contestant Rudy Boesch, an older ex-Navy man who disapproved of Hatch's lifestyle but allied himself with him anyway. The two forged an odd-couple partnership that speaks volumes about America's acceptance of gay personalities.</p> <p>Survivor regularly attracted 15 millions viewers, Will &amp; Grace gets 10 million. As Entertainment Weekly said, 'There you have it - the real reason for the increasing number of gay shows on TV. They're starting to make money.' More importantly, advertisers have identified a key demographic audience - 18-49-year-olds who, with plenty of disposable income, are a highly sought after group.</p> <p>'It's always a good thing when anything in film or TV gets an enormous approval and gets a mass viewership, because this means it's making money for the network and sponsors,' says Judy Wieder of Advocate, a leading gay magazine. 'And it also means that it's changing attitudes enough that the audience's fear level is going down and they can enjoy various things about gay life.</p> <p>'But even though progress is being made, I think that - like in every other industry - if you are gay and behind the scenes and have a good track record for making money, you won't have people get in your way and you won't be held back, but if you're an actor or an actress and out there in front, you have to be very careful.'</p> <p>Though there seem to be an abundance of gay storylines in Hollywood, like everything in the entertainment world, looks can be deceiving. Certainly, gay characters are cropping up with more regularity on TV. And movies that address gay themes are guaranteed a slot on the schedule of any self-respecting independent film company. The last few film seasons alone have produced such critics' darlings as Go Fish, High Art, and The Opposite of Sex.</p> <p>Coming this autumn is the much-anticipated film Before Night Falls, starring Johnny Depp as the transvestite lover of a gay Cuban poet, and The Broken Hearts Club, an ensemble gay buddies comedy. Yet many feel that Hollywood is still most comfortable with gay characters when they stay 'in their place'.</p> <p>Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office performance of movies, says there are issues that define gay-themed indie films. 'Usually there's a more realistic portrayal of gay in indie films than in bigger Hollywood films - indie films address the issues and lifestyles of gays more directly. In major Hollywood films gay characters are sidekicks, or as in The Birdcage, it's sort of a fantasy vision of gay life, a more packaged version of gay life, with big stars like Robin Williams playing wacky gay characters. That's where indie films are probably truer to the gay experience.</p> <p>'With someone like Rupert Everett,' Dergarabedian continues, 'when The Next Best Thing didn't do well, it wasn't a bias from audiences against his character (Madonna's pal and father to her child). It just wasn't a good film. But in My Best Friend's Wedding, the studio added more scenes of him, he was a terrific character, and that worked so well for the movie. But remember, you didn't see his lifestyle at home - he was just a pal of Julia Roberts.'</p> <p>Bill Condon, writer-director of Gods and Monsters, thinks touchy-feely gay films might be on their way out and that the transplanting of Britain's Queer As Folk TV series to the States as a cable show, might offer a glimmer of reality. 'I believe there's about to be less emphasis on sentimentalism, on gay people as role models as it were. Having been demonised, either as silly sidekicks, villains or tragic figures, we've now become these angelised-yet-tiresome figures in films. It will be interesting to see how Queer as Folk translates over here, since in Britain there's a more unblinking, more adventurous, edgy quality to gay-themed projects, dating back to My Beautiful Laundrette. Queer as Folk is in-your-face, but it's really more honest, in ways that are not just about sex.'</p> <p>In the past Hollywood would shroud its gay references in humour and innuendo, sneaking a wink-wink past the censor board to those audience members who were 'with the programme'. There were actors like William Haines, a star at Metro-Goldwyn Mayer in the 1920s, who was dropped by the studio in 1933 because he refused to hide his homosexuality. The early character actor Franklin Painborne was flighty, fey, funny, and obviously playing gay if you were paying attention, according to Sikov, author of a forthcoming biography of Peter Sellers.</p> <p>'When it's so close to the surface of the text it's not that hard to decipher,' Sikov notes. 'In Charlie Chaplin's City Lights, there's a whole scene where Charlie has a very peculiar relationship with a drunken millionaire. They sleep in the same bed, Chaplin gives him a little love pat before he goes to sleep - and this is 1931. Clearly the joke is as conscious as it can be without being stated. Today, because the subject is so on people's minds, there's more paranoia - you would never see that kind of anything-goes behaviour.'</p> <p>In the Fifties and Sixties, Rock Hudson's comedies with Doris Day layered subtext upon subtext, which Sikov feels was intentional. 'In Pillow Talk there's some possibility of Hudson being pregnant - I mean, oh my God! Some people clearly got the joke, and I think every gay person in America knew Hudson was gay for a very long time. Those films all dealt in subtext.'</p> <p>Groundbreaking Sixties American films such as The Children's Hour and Midnight Cowboy (starring Jon Voight) alluded to their main character's gayness without really saying it. Later, films such as The Boys in the Band, Cruising, and Victor/Victoria placed gay characters in specific easy-to-spot realms (queeny, dangerous, period pieces), or, in the case of Making Love, neutered them and defined their existence through a wife's point of view.</p> <p>In the Nineties gay-themed films became the province of independent cinema, as Torch Song Trilogy, Longtime Companion, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, The Crying Game, Jeffrey, and Love! Valour! Compassion! created an entire subgenre of gay cinema, and outwardly gay producers (such as Scott Rudin) became some of Hollywood's biggest players, with their sexuality not being an issue.</p> <p>On TV there were tentative moves with Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City and an adaptation of Randy Shilts's book And the Band Played On. By the end of the decade gay writer-director Kevin Williamson had added a major gay character to his teen-angst drama Dawson's Creek, and Will &amp; Grace put the subject matter at the centre.</p> <p>Condon thinks there are still limits to how gays are portrayed in different media. 'All of television is based upon people you invite into your living room and feel comfortable with week after week,' he says. 'Movies, I think, are different. Blacks on TV are Cosby, whereas blacks in the movies are Big Momma's House, or something equally outrageous. There's a big difference. With movies, people are paying to see something more rude than on TV. And, for TV, gay people are pithy, entertaining, funny - people you'd want in your home.'</p> <p>'There is more acceptance on television,' adds Sikov, 'but I've never had a conversation about Will &amp; Grace with a straight person that didn't begin, \"Eric McCormack (Will on the show) isn't gay, right?\" Well, Anthony Hopkins doesn't really eat people, does he? He's playing a role. Statements like that essentially reveal that people want to watch it and give it credit, but they want to make sure it's not hitting too close to home.'</p>",

'There is more acceptance on television,' adds Sikov, 'but I've never had a conversation about Will &amp; Grace with a straight person that didn't begin, \"Eric McCormack (Will on the show) isn't gay, right?\" Well, Anthony Hopkins doesn't really eat people, does he? He's playing a role. Statements like that essentially reveal that people want to watch it and give it credit, but they want to make sure it's not hitting too close to home.'",

      "body": "<p>This year's Venice Film Festival did not boast a hugely impressive selection of films. Tellingly, the opening film was Clint Eastwood's OAP odyssey Space Cowboys. Standing out among the other entries, however, was Memento, a film by a young UK director named Christopher Nolan, and if you hadn't seen his low-budget debut, a thriller called Following, you could be forgiven for thinking this was just another worthy British corset-and-bonnet drama. But Memento turned out to be something very different. Its roots are in film noir, but it also harks back to the darker classics, like Josef Von Sternberg's The Blue Angel, in which human will is revealed to be grim, flawed and perversely inevitable. It stars Guy Pearce as Leonard, a man with no short-term memory, an affliction that is apparently the result of the shock he experienced when seeing his wife raped and killed by an intruder. The killer's name is John G, as Leonard knows all too well, since his name is tattooed across his chest, surrounded by various clues to the killer's habitat and identity. But unusually for a film of this type, Memento begins with the final judgment and then tells the story backwards. </p> <p>Leonard has John G at gunpoint, and wastes no time in killing him. But how did Leonard get here? It's a question that Memento skirts around with admirable dexterity; because of Leonard's 'condition', the film only tells us what he knows, when he knows it, and teases us with the circumstances. There's the sultry Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who bonds with Leonard because she's lost a lover too and sympathises (or does she?). And there's his irritating friend Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), another shifty character. And for a while it simply seems that Memento is taking us nowhere in particular, just backwards, until it suddenly pans out to reveal its carefully hidden agenda. And if you make it that far (no one's saying it will be easy), this imaginative and daring film turns into a thrilling mystery. </p> <p>Twist follows twist, and the final, subtle revelation lingers long in the mind, a startling piece of double-think that trumps The Usual Suspects's surprise denouement. </p> <p>Pearce, of course, should be used to this kind of stuff, having co-starred as upright cop Ed Exley in the adaptation of James Ellroy's brain-aching novel LA Confidential. Even so, he admits on the sun-drenched terrace of the Excelsior Hotel on the Venice Lido, it wasn't exactly immediate. So how did he take it? 'Probably similar to you, when you watched the film,' he grins, 'in that there's a lot of specific detail about the character and a lot of ambiguity about what he's going through as well as a great deal of confusion. I really had to break the script down and try to look at it as a more logical set of circumstances. Because at the end of every scene, you're not really satisfied like you are when you're watching a normal film. You're desperate to see the next scene to have it make sense.' </p> <p>Nolan, the brains behind this extraordinary film, is a nonchalant 30-year-old. His rapid career rise has occurred with apparent ease. He simply stuck to his studies at college in London and made films in his spare time. He has, he says, made films since he was eight years old, when he and his brother made 8mm war movies starring their Action Man figures, although the arrival of Star Wars sent him off briefly into the realm of science fiction. </p> <p>Asked how he got into making films on a more serious level, Nolan says simply that he did it 'by making a film. Kubrick was asked this once,' he says, 'and he said exactly the same thing. You only learn by doing it.' </p> <p> Following, the micro-budget British thriller he released last year, had some of Memento 's panache, if not its production values. But sensing a way forward, Nolan pushed the film through a series of film festivals, starting with San Francisco. The attention brought him the deal to make Memento, which was inspired by a short story his brother was writing about a killer suffering an identity crisis. Nolan borrowed the story and ran with it, but far from being aggrieved, his brother helped him construct the film's elaborate and ingenious website at <a href=\"http://www.otnemem.com\">www.otnemem.com</a> (memento backwards). </p> <p>The film went on to become a hit at three of the summer's major festivals. In Venice, Nolan says the subtitles didn't carry all of the film's jet-black humour and the fraught silence perturbed him, he really didn't know whether the notoriously fickle crowd would cheer or boo. Needless to say, he was astounded when he received a five-minute ovation, and yet again the following week when Memento won three major awards at the Deauville festival in France. The screening at the Toronto festival caused a major buzz, too, and Nolan is having a hard time adjusting. </p> <p>Without even trying, Nolan has effortlessly broken away from the rash of Britpack gangster films. His vision goes back to the more surreal and stately likes of Nicolas Roeg and Lindsay Anderson, who revolutionised our movie style (if not our industry) in the Seventies. There is, however, a catch to all this: we can only lay claim to half of Christopher Nolan when we try to set Memento against the Britfilm failures of the past 12 months. </p> <p>'My mother's American,' he says, 'so I've got both passports and I can work in both places. I've lived a bit in the States, but I've spent most of my life in England, so I always knew I had this great opportunity to work in both places.' </p> <p>And for the moment, he's staying in LA, where he moved with his wife when she landed a new job with British production company Working Title. In fact, he's just got back from Alaska, where he's been scouting locations for his next film, a remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller Insomnia, which starred Stellan Skarsgard as a crack detective who accidentally kills his partner. </p> <p>'To tell you the truth, I first had the idea when I saw the movie two years ago,' he says. 'I thought it could have been a much bigger movie - it had such a great central premise. But I thought it would be really interesting to take it in a slightly different direction, make it slightly more expansive. Make it different by Americanising it.' </p> <p>And if Memento is anything to go by, the chances are Nolan should do an impressive job. And at a time when the British movie industry is low, gloomy and fatalistic, we need a director like that - a new Ridley Scott, to lift us out of the doldrums. So what if we can only claim half? On current form, it's got to be better than nothing.'</p> <p><strong>Carrie-Anne Moss, the star of Memento</strong><br>Interview by Mark Morris</p> <p>Carrie-Anne Moss is trying to talk about Memento, but it's hard. Not because she doesn't like the film (she loves it) or because it was a tough experience. The problem is a little more immediate: it's the five puppies that are scrabbling all over her. 'I have a slew of animals,' she explains out of breath. 'It's my final puppy day: they are going to their new homes at the weekend.' </p> <p>So it turns out that the 33-year-old Moss isn't quite the icy figure that her role in The Matrix suggested. But that remains the only place most us will have seen her.

      "bodyText": "Bitter feuds at the heart of Tony Blair's Government are set to resurface this week with publication of a book describing Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, as a destabilising force. The book, by former Paymaster-General Geoffrey Robinson, reveals stand-up rows over the Government's political direction and blames Mandelson for many of Blair's difficulties in keeping his warring Cabinet together. The book will describe Mandelson as a divisive force who let the rift between Blair and Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, grow wider. The book will also reveal damaging details about the \u00a3373,000 home loan Robinson gave to the Northern Ireland Secretary before the last general election. It is also expected to show that Brown, once a close friend of Robinson, hated the way Mandelson was constantly building and breaking alliances in order to gain more power for himself. Robinson's book, The Unconventional Minister, is the latest in a long line of publications that have rocked Blair's administration. Both Brown and officials at Number 10 tried to get Robinson to abandon the project. Last month Servants of the People, by The Observer's chief political commentator, Andrew Rawnsley, revealed similar bad blood between some of the most powerful people in the country. Dismissed by the Government as 'tittle tattle', privately it was admitted that the book had cast an embarrassing light on government in-fighting. The book also claimed that Brown and Blair had lied over the \u00a31 million loan by Bernie Ecclestone, the F1 tycoon. A week after Rawnsley's book was reported in The Observer, a biography of Mo Mowlam by Julia Langdon uncovered further anger among Ministers over their treatment by Blair and other leading Cabinet members. The Government is now braced for bad publicity over Robinson's book, expected to reveal that Mandelson pleaded for the money to buy a home in Notting Hill, west London. He would not have been able to afford the house on his ministerial salary. When the loan became public in Christmas 1998, Mandelson, then head of the Department of Trade and Industry, had to resign, as did Robinson, who was being investigated by the DTI. Robinson has never detailed his version of events, which is expected to differ markedly from Mandelson's. He is thought to be angry that Mandelson was rehabilitated by Blair while he was left in the political wilderness. The book will also say that Blair told Robinson that he believed Brown would succeed him. This will delight Brown supporters who say the Chancellor still wants to lead the country. 'Peter is the cause of a lot of the problems and I don't think he has to be,' Robinson said in an interview with the Daily Mail yesterday. 'He is a big enough figure in his own right to have his say without becoming the divisive and destabilising influence he is. 'The consequences of saying that will not be pleasant, but it needs to be said.' Asked if Brown 'loathed' Mandelson, he answered: 'I wouldn't necessarily use such an emotive word. I think Gordon feels very sorry that we are in this situation. The prime cause is Peter. I'm sure that otherwise Tony and Gordon could work out a modus operandi.' Robinson will reveal Brown's anger when he felt that Mandelson was trying to undermine his 'wait and see' policy on the euro. 'Yes, there were rows and swearing,' Robinson said. 'It's a release valve. But Peter is the cause of many of those problems. I don't believe Gordon initiates it. Peter knows exactly what he is doing.' Blair defended Mandelson yesterday against the Robinson allegations. 'The Prime Minister has to put together the Government. The people he puts into government are those he believes who do a good job. Peter is doing a difficult job and doing it well in Northern Ireland,' Blair's spokesman said. Asked whether Robinson had helped his own cause by writing the book, the spokesman said that was 'a matter for him'.",

      "body": "<p>'I don't have any friends who are girls.' He sniggers. 'I've got about 20 girlfriends though.' Several people laugh at this and a grin of triumph spreads over his face. He's got cropped hair and a practised air of urban cool, leaning back in his chair in his grungy clothes and mud-spattered, unlaced boots, smirking, casting amused and complicit glances at his neighbours, acting tough. He's skinny, 11 years old, a little boy wanting to be the centre of attention, playing it for laughs. </p> <p>'I just want to talk about sex,' says another boy, under his breath but wanting to be heard. </p> <p>I am sitting in a circle of 29 Year Seven girls and boys at King Edward VII lower school in Sheffield, for what's called 'Personal, Social and Health Education'. Dot Kesterton, one of the few full-time PSHE teachers in the country, remains impeccably cool as she 'climate sets' for the discussions they will have over the next few terms. </p> <p>Not far from this 1,600-strong comprehensive, an 11-year-old boy got his 14-year-old girlfriend pregnant last year and was splashed all over the tabloids (one gave him a BMX in return for his story). The baby has now been born and the boy says he is proud to be a father. He claims it was sex education that was to blame - the words put ideas into his head. Until then, he says he was an innocent child. </p> <p>And in Rotherham, a few miles away, an 11-year-old girl gave birth to her baby without even realising she was pregnant. Not far away, West Yorkshire, an area of great beauty, closed mines, high poverty and lost hopes, has the highest teenage pregnancy records in the UK. </p> <p>Everyone in the class has written private statements for Dot Kesterton, setting out what they want and do not want from their peers, from which she has extrapolated a list. It is a litany of curiosity, fear and secret desires. What they want is what they often don't have, and what they fear is what they often get. More than anything, they want people to listen to them, not to laugh at them. They want people to try to understand them and not to bully them, ignore them, tease and torment them; to be friendly, calm, attentive. </p> <p>They don't want people to embarrass them or talk about them behind their back, to snigger, sneer or make them feel sad, alone, ignorant, different and ashamed. They want to know about sex education, drugs, disease, homosexuality, bisexuality, sexual intercourse, Aids, sexism, alcohol, peer pressure, child abuse, friendships... </p> <p>In private, they are eager, uncertain and anxious about these things. In public, they sit in a fidgeting, self-conscious circle, whispering, snickering, giggling, frowning, smiling in a knowing way, tapping their feet, playing with their hair, doodling on their folders, looking down at their laps. There's a great divide between how young people feel and how they behave. Their soft, inner self is kept separate from the hardened self they present to the outside world. It's cool to be cool; cool to be tough; cool to be sexy; cool to pretend you're an adult. The dreamy, curious world of childhood gets hidden away. </p> <p>'You can't say to teenagers, \"Don't do that\",' says a 16-year-old girl, speaking at a meeting of the National Children's Bureau's Sex Education Forum, an umbrella body that promotes effective sex education. 'There's a difference between education and promotion,' says another. 'There's too much focus on sex and not enough on what leads to sex; there's not enough about relationships.' 'Why aren't we asked what we feel? Adults think they have the right to tell us what things we should hear. We should have input. We should grow up realising it's not a subject to be scared of, so that when we grow up we can sit down and talk to our own children.' </p> <p>These teenagers are articulate, composed and show emotional intelligence. All but one of those who speak are girls. Adults speak but don't listen, they say. They all say that they want their voices and their views to be heard. </p> <p>The Government has just launched a new advertising campaign to encourage teenagers to abstain from early sex. 'It's OK to be a virgin,' said one headline. Yvette Cooper, the Public Health Minister, has encouraged the advertising agency to use a 'hip' and 'groovy' tone, rather than a forbidding or embarrassed one. So a poster that reads 'Sex: Are You Thinking About It Enough?' captures young people's attention, while the small print encourages them to think it's cool to say no. Critics of the scheme have already drawn parallels between this scheme and the attempt earlier in the year to lessen the use of waif models in magazines. They accuse the Government of interference, bossiness and irrelevance. </p> <p>It's the irrelevance that really mat ters, the belief that a poster can prevent at a glance what young people have learnt over years. Young people embark on their first sexual relationships because of their confidence and lack of it, their self-esteem and lack of it, their fear, their curiosity, their ignorance; because of peer pressure, the need for affection, the terror of being different; because they are in love; because they want a lift home; because it's fun; because hormones are surging round their bodies; because their dad's run off, their mum's run off; because they are mature enough; because they are immature; because they want to say yes; because they can't say no; because they don't feel loved in the rest of their life; because it's what they think they're expected to do; because they are bombarded in all directions by sexualised images; because why not, because what the hell, because they are ignorant about the consequences and think that if you do it standing up you're not going to have a baby; because adults are hypocritical about sex; because they are told not to; because it is risky and reckless; because Aids and syphilis won't happen to them; because nobody talks about it; because nobody listens; because they are 14, 15, 16, 17; because they want to, need to. </p> <p>And because of desire, which, put in the scale against all the epic cons, can tip it. So much of the way we think about sex in the UK is in terms of disease and dysfunction, blisters and babies. Sex education is often framed in ideology and measured by how successful it is in limiting teenage pregnancy. Young people are told by their parents and figures of authority how it happens, but why it shouldn't ('it' being one of the most common ways of not saying the word). Sex becomes smutty and forbidden, titillating and trashy. Desire, pleasure and respect are off the agenda. Nor is there any evidence that simply telling young people to abstain has any effect, rather the reverse. More knowledge means less early sex. More talk means less action. </p> <p>Yet among many people, there is still considerable resistance to a coherent sex-education policy and a belief that to provide sex education is to promote sexual activity. The media still blames liberal teachers and parents for lower ages of first sexual experiences. Education as corruption: the 11-year-old boy becoming a father because of what he heard in the classroom. </p> <p>Sex as smut, the ultimate British joke - silly and tacky. Sex as hypocrisy - it sells newspapers, TV programmes. It saturates our culture and jumps out at us from billboards, yet it is still a forbidden subject of serious debate. Sex as a double standard - boys are taught about masturbation and wet dreams; girls are taught about periods and pregnancy. Sex as something separate from relationships, and the world in which we live now. </p> <p>The needs of children are so dramatic and yet nobody is really talking. For many young people, sex is not a rebellion but a way of belonging, not a pleasure but a trap and a nightmare. </p> <p> <strong> Children</strong> </p> <p> 'Children are sexually educated anyway,' says Simon Blake of Sex Education Forum who on 31 October chairs a conference, 'Taking the Initiative', which will explore effective sex education. 'Whether we like it or not, they learn. They learn from all around them - from TV, newspapers and magazines, other children. Myths are ingrained and children live in a deeply sexualised culture. Even very young children are encouraged to behave in a sexual way.' </p> <p>The rituals of the playground have changed. Pre-teen boys and girls used to play at mummies and daddies. Now they play at going out, complicated mimicries of dating, kissing, flirting and dumping. A boy will ask a girl out, or at least his mates will ask her out for him, for this is nothing to do with friendship. 'Going out' may consist of a circuit of a playground; dumping means ignoring them the next day. Whereas Dutch children tend to have friends of both sexes, in Britain boys and girls live in parallel worlds. </p> <p> <strong> Girls</strong> </p> <p> The majority of teenage girls say they regret their first sexual encounters. Most say they first have sex because pressure is put on them by boys. Although the teenage pregnancy rate across all groups is higher than in other countries, it is much higher for those girls who don't see a future for themselves - who have academically failed, who are poor, or who are the children of very young parents. 'It is too easy just to say that sex education is a simple social exclusion issue,' says Gill Frances of the National Children's Bureau. </p> <p>'But it is true that teenage pregnancy rates are up to nine times higher in poorer areas. Sex and relationship education should be an entitlement, but it won't cure the problem of social exclusion and poverty. It works the other way round. Put yourself into the mind of a young girl of 15, living in a run-down estate; she's never known what it is to feel secure, her dad's somewhere else, she's never fitted into her school, she's lonely, scared, unconfident. You can understand, can't you, why she'd have a baby.' </p> <p>When girls are asked why they first have sex, says Jo Adams of the Sheffield Centre of Aids and Sexual Health, they answer, \"To keep my boyfriend, to get a cuddle, to know I'm attractive, because I loved him, to get a lift home\". These reasons do not necessarily have anything to do with sex, particularly not with depressing bad sex with a partner who may not be well chosen. </p> <p>'It's like looking in the fridge for feelings. You don't find out that you're attractive, intelligent or beloved in the back seat of a car or in rapid, fumbling sex behind the youth centre. Girls can get into a downward spiral of self-esteem and diminishing returns. </p> <p>In Jo Adams's groups of girls, the focus is on assertiveness and self-esteem. 'Which bit of no didn't you understand?' is one of the catch- phrases of the group which calls itself Girls on a Mission. Lots of the young people she works with come from poor and fractured families; they are bored, frustrated and undermined. 'One of my colleagues said that if you gave everyone a bike, there'd be a lot less sex. There's something in that.' If girls are encouraged to go cycling, play the guitar, write poetry, do yoga, practical things where they can feel successful and empowered, then they feel more in control of their lives and their futures. Horizons, which had been blotted out, open up. Success breeds success; assertiveness assertiveness. Saying no once means that it is easier to say no the second time. </p> <p>When teenage girls were asked how they felt after not saying no to sex when they wanted to say no, the replies were: 'Angry... anxious... despairing... resentful... tired... annoyed with myself... irritated... uncomfortable... disappointed... frustrated_ fed-up.' And after managing to say no: 'Not so scared... pleased with myself... more open with the other person... strong... satisfied...less anxious... relieved... proud of myself... lighter.' </p> <p> <strong> Boys</strong> </p> <p> Most teenage boys first have sex because pressure is put on them by other boys. </p> <p> 'Many boys don't report regret,' says Gill Frances, 'which doesn't mean they don't feel it. But they are under huge pressure, and frequently they wish it hadn't happened. They live in a culture in which early sexual experience is glorified. Young boys posture in front of each other. But they have real anxieties about sex.' She and Simon Blake talk of things that teenage boys have said to them: 'I was right in the middle of it, and I thought, \"What will my friends think of me now?\" I wondered what on earth I was doing and then I remembered that my friends would cheer when I walked out of the door\".' They talk about the great divide between the tough, swaggering, posturing public persona of boys in particular and the scared, unready private one: 'Culture rewards them for the public persona. These teenagers know the trap they are in and still they can't get out of it. It is too dangerous for them. Think of all the bullying and the homophobia.' </p> <p>Jo Adams agrees. 'Boys present a cool and streetwise image, effing and blinding and talking about girls being up for it. Conquest is part of their status. I've heard teenage boys, say: \"What's the matter with you; haven't you got a kid yet? Some kind of poofter?\" The way they talk, you'd think they were Warren Beatty, but we get them to write down in private the questions they want asked, and these great, strapping lads of 15 and 16 ask: is it all right to have wet dreams, or how long should an erect penis be? They are marshmallows inside, anxious, frightened, excited, the way we all feel when we start out on a relationship. </p> <p>'What often worries me is that a lot of professionals who should know better - doctors, teachers, nurses - believe the image these lads present. They don't see beneath the surface. We've got to explore behind the fa\u00e7ade.' </p> <p>'But what we need to ask,' says Gill Frances, 'is how do we talk to that private, vulnerable, tender, needy boy? How do we reach him, rather than the swaggering, cocky persona he is hiding behind? The socialisation of boys here,' she continues, 'is vile . It is very different in Scandinavia and Holland. There, there is not the same division between genders. In Holland, as many boys as girls say they have sex for love. Here, they do it because of what their mates will think. In Holland, they talk to their mother or father, go to the clinic with their partner.' </p> <p>Boys are more homophobic than girls. If boys are not good enough at being 'male', this has a huge and horrible impact on them at school and among their peers. By being anti-gay, they are proving their own masculinity. Boys who are clever, good at school, into certain types of music, who are too small, too pretty, whose voices are not deep enough, who like the company of girls, these are the boys who are going to have a tough time. Jo Adams thinks that while feminism has given girls a way of thinking about their sexuality, there's no equivalent for boys: 'Just Iron John beating his chest in the woods, or Wet New Man. Feminists had to slog; they took risks. There are some boys taking risks now, and they are vilified.' </p> <p> <strong> Parents</strong> </p> <p> Most children say that they want to learn about sex from their parents first, but a lot of adults are ignorant about sex themselves. Simon Blake says that adults often ask questions like: 'How do I know if I've had an orgasm? Am I putting it in the right hole? Where does a period come from? Will I get pregnant if I swallow sperm?' </p> <p>One of the reasons that Holland and Scandinavia are so much more successful in their sex education than we are is because parents talk more and more openly to their children. Here, even when we are reasonably confident with the biology, we are inadequate with the relationships. Yet all the research shows that children want the facts to come out of talking through feelings. They want to talk about sex as important and connected with the rest of their life, not just as a mechanical act but an emotional one, as something that is special and prized. 'If you talk about it as mucky and round the back, you do it mucky and round the back,' says Gill Frances. </p> <p>'Don't talk to them about your own sex lives or ask directly about theirs,' says Simon Blake. 'Talk generally; come at the matter sideways. Discuss sexual relationships in general. It's tough to talk about our own sex lives, but it's easy and safe and not embarrassing to think about other people's lives and problems, or chat about dilemmas facing characters in soap operas.' </p> <p>He describes a recent confrontation between a mother and son. Son (genuinely wanting to initiate a debate): 'When do you think you're old enough to have sex?' Mother (terrified): ' I hope you're not doing it .' Son (who wasn't) probably goes out and does 'it'. </p> <p>It is often preferable for fathers to talk to sons, mothers to daughters. 'Women don't necessarily understand male sexuality,' says Gill Frances, 'so they often pitch it wrong. If a boy says, \"I keep having erections\" the mother might say, \"That's disgusting, you should show more respect\", whereas the father's more likely to say, \"Only 10 a day!\" He would normalise it, take away the anxiety and the shame. </p> <p>Liz Wilson works with a group in Sheffield called Parents Together Project; her official title is 'voluntary parent peer educator'. She has been trained as an educator and now works with parent groups, either for a single, two-hour session or over four week, to help them feel more confident about the way they are talking to and listening to their children. 'It's really about enabling better communication between parents and kids,' she says, 'but focusing on sexual relationships.' </p> <p>Her own children are seven, 10 and 13. She has conversations with each of them, from the 'Where do I come from' questions, through to puberty, wet dreams, being gay. 'Before I did the training,' she says, 'my approach was that I would always answer any questions that they asked me openly, honestly, without embarrassment. But, you know, there are loads of questions they simply don't ask, and we need to encourage parents to bring up the subject, but in a natural kind of way.' </p> <p>She gives as an example a situation with her 13-year-old son: 'We were watching a TV drama and everyone was leaping in and out of bed with each other, and I asked, \"What do you think about that? Should they have had sex with each other so quickly?\" I'm not saying, \"What's going on in your sex life?\" but rather trying to look with him at issues around sex and relationships. </p> <p>'Young people are entitled to their secrets and parents need to respect that, just as I wouldn't tell my children about my own sexual practices. We should go at things obliquely - it's often better to talk while not looking at each other. Talk when you're cooking, walking, driving along in a car. And,' she adds, 'talk about sex as something that can be wonderful, pleasurable, important.' </p> <p>She says she thinks boys have a raw deal. 'Mums and daughters talk more, and they have more starting points, like the start of menstruation, obviously. Boys have no real starting point. And they have much more pressure. There are lots of ways for a girl to be a girl, but only one way for a boy to be a boy. I think it's rotten for them.' </p> <p> <strong> Schools</strong> </p> <p> Sex education is on the national curriculum in secondary schools now, but only the reproductive and hormonal parts - 'The stuff about making babies,' as Gill Frances puts it. All the rest - friendship, self-esteem, desire, disease, everything that may enable a child to think about becoming an adult, everything that may give children pause - is taught under PSHE and is voluntary. In a strange way, we are moralistic about sex, and yet in sex education we take it out of its moral context, making it clinical and alien. </p> <p>'Too little, too late, too biological,' says Jo Adams. 'Not enough about emotions, which is what all young people say they need and want. Not about being jealous, getting dumped, being scared, body-image, rage, shame, guilt, being laughed at.' </p> <p>Gill Frances talks about the school as the place where the 'jigsaw' that the parents have started gets filled in, and where skills must be developed and practised with a peer group. 'We need to get to kids before the rest of the world gets to them. Of course,' she adds, 'the pre-giggle stage is younger and younger. Teachers, who are often untrained and squeeze PSHE into \"guidance\" sessions and circle time, remain anxious about sex education because they are often operating on the blurred line of the law. One hard-pressed teacher told me that at her school of course they hardly teach any sex education at all.' </p> <p>John Tripp of Exeter University has a more behaviourist approach to sex education. 'Knowledge is simply not enough. We need a kind of social learning.' He is the founder of A Pause (Added Power and Understanding in Sex Education), whose programme is to be delivered to all secondary schools in north and east Devon. He believes that abstaining from sexual activity, even for a few months, is extremely beneficial to young people. </p> <p>Traditional sex education, he says, is bound to be problematic. Teachers have not had the training, have no methodology to deal with it confidently. The clich\u00e9 of the young female teacher in a class full of snickering teenage boys is often also the truth. Also, he says, schools are largely 'places of fact. Teachers are not usually required to deal with relationships and feelings'. </p> <p>He also claims that there is no evidence that the plain facts influence teenagers' behaviour one way or the other. 'Behaviour is largely dependent on what you see around you. What you see,' he adds, 'is often not the truth - young people often think that everyone except them is having sex, because they say that they are, whereas, of course, most of them aren't. Part of A Pause's work is to demolish the myths.' </p> <p>A Pause uses out-of-school professionals (they have more credibility than teachers) and 16- to-19-year-olds to deliver sex education. The class becomes more collaborative and open. It is split into small groups; role-plays are encouraged. Tripp has even coined the term 'outercourse' (as opposed to intercourse), as a way of encouraging young people to hold off from early and unhappy sex. </p> <p>'We are not trying to make them toe the line. We're not indoctrinating young people against sexual activity. We are trying to help their self-efficacy skills, so that they actually do what they want and believe in, rather than become swamped by social pressure. It is tragic how few girls actually enjoy their first sexual experiences. We want people to have have successful, long-term sexual careers.' </p> <p> <strong> Talking</strong> </p> <p> 'We live in a country of prudery and pornography,' says Jo Adams. 'We are struggling with a tabloid culture. The very people who are really trying to develop a strategy for helping young people are peddled as the people who are irresponsible, and who are blamed for adolescent behaviour. Why should we expect young people to be responsible, when they've got us as role models? Sex isn't scandalous or dirty. Take it out from behind the bike sheds. Take it out from under the proscriptions of religious leaders.' </p> <p>'We aren't honest with young people,' says Gill Frances. 'We tell them to say no, but we don't tell them that sex is far more difficult to refuse than chocolate. We say: watch out! Be careful. We say it's dangerous. We don't say it's fun, pleasurable, lovely, important, but there are problems. Sex education is not just about knowledge and finding information; it's about finding ways of talking to children and listening to them.' </p> <p>'But it's hard to talk about sex,' says Jo Adams. 'We talk about emotions, we talk about family, work, food, holidays and verrucas... there's a great silence surrounding sex. We don't even talk with our partners - we have sex with them, but we can't say the words. </p> <p>'And one of the things we struggle with is that sex does need to be risky in some ways. So how do we create a context in sex education that enables a young person to take risks safely.' </p> <p>'It's about emotional intelligence,' says Gill Frances, 'and the power to name feelings, to be able to say, \"I'm scared and in need. I'm lonely. Please help\".' </p> <p>'It's about talking,' says Jo Adams. 'Start with talking.' </p> <p>'And,' says Gill Frances, 'it's about saying we have to change the world.' </p> <p><strong> Sextistics</strong><br> </p> <p>Britain has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Europe, and one of the highest of any developed country.

      "bodyText": "'I don't have any friends who are girls.' He sniggers. 'I've got about 20 girlfriends though.' Several people laugh at this and a grin of triumph spreads over his face. He's got cropped hair and a practised air of urban cool, leaning back in his chair in his grungy clothes and mud-spattered, unlaced boots, smirking, casting amused and complicit glances at his neighbours, acting tough. He's skinny, 11 years old, a little boy wanting to be the centre of attention, playing it for laughs. 'I just want to talk about sex,' says another boy, under his breath but wanting to be heard. I am sitting in a circle of 29 Year Seven girls and boys at King Edward VII lower school in Sheffield, for what's called 'Personal, Social and Health Education'. Dot Kesterton, one of the few full-time PSHE teachers in the country, remains impeccably cool as she 'climate sets' for the discussions they will have over the next few terms. Not far from this 1,600-strong comprehensive, an 11-year-old boy got his 14-year-old girlfriend pregnant last year and was splashed all over the tabloids (one gave him a BMX in return for his story). The baby has now been born and the boy says he is proud to be a father. He claims it was sex education that was to blame - the words put ideas into his head. Until then, he says he was an innocent child. And in Rotherham, a few miles away, an 11-year-old girl gave birth to her baby without even realising she was pregnant. Not far away, West Yorkshire, an area of great beauty, closed mines, high poverty and lost hopes, has the highest teenage pregnancy records in the UK. Everyone in the class has written private statements for Dot Kesterton, setting out what they want and do not want from their peers, from which she has extrapolated a list. It is a litany of curiosity, fear and secret desires. What they want is what they often don't have, and what they fear is what they often get. More than anything, they want people to listen to them, not to laugh at them. They want people to try to understand them and not to bully them, ignore them, tease and torment them; to be friendly, calm, attentive. They don't want people to embarrass them or talk about them behind their back, to snigger, sneer or make them feel sad, alone, ignorant, different and ashamed. They want to know about sex education, drugs, disease, homosexuality, bisexuality, sexual intercourse, Aids, sexism, alcohol, peer pressure, child abuse, friendships... In private, they are eager, uncertain and anxious about these things. In public, they sit in a fidgeting, self-conscious circle, whispering, snickering, giggling, frowning, smiling in a knowing way, tapping their feet, playing with their hair, doodling on their folders, looking down at their laps. There's a great divide between how young people feel and how they behave. Their soft, inner self is kept separate from the hardened self they present to the outside world. It's cool to be cool; cool to be tough; cool to be sexy; cool to pretend you're an adult. The dreamy, curious world of childhood gets hidden away. 'You can't say to teenagers, \"Don't do that\",' says a 16-year-old girl, speaking at a meeting of the National Children's Bureau's Sex Education Forum, an umbrella body that promotes effective sex education. 'There's a difference between education and promotion,' says another. 'There's too much focus on sex and not enough on what leads to sex; there's not enough about relationships.' 'Why aren't we asked what we feel? Adults think they have the right to tell us what things we should hear. We should have input. We should grow up realising it's not a subject to be scared of, so that when we grow up we can sit down and talk to our own children.' These teenagers are articulate, composed and show emotional intelligence. All but one of those who speak are girls. Adults speak but don't listen, they say. They all say that they want their voices and their views to be heard. The Government has just launched a new advertising campaign to encourage teenagers to abstain from early sex. 'It's OK to be a virgin,' said one headline. Yvette Cooper, the Public Health Minister, has encouraged the advertising agency to use a 'hip' and 'groovy' tone, rather than a forbidding or embarrassed one. So a poster that reads 'Sex: Are You Thinking About It Enough?' captures young people's attention, while the small print encourages them to think it's cool to say no. Critics of the scheme have already drawn parallels between this scheme and the attempt earlier in the year to lessen the use of waif models in magazines. They accuse the Government of interference, bossiness and irrelevance. It's the irrelevance that really mat ters, the belief that a poster can prevent at a glance what young people have learnt over years. Young people embark on their first sexual relationships because of their confidence and lack of it, their self-esteem and lack of it, their fear, their curiosity, their ignorance; because of peer pressure, the need for affection, the terror of being different; because they are in love; because they want a lift home; because it's fun; because hormones are surging round their bodies; because their dad's run off, their mum's run off; because they are mature enough; because they are immature; because they want to say yes; because they can't say no; because they don't feel loved in the rest of their life; because it's what they think they're expected to do; because they are bombarded in all directions by sexualised images; because why not, because what the hell, because they are ignorant about the consequences and think that if you do it standing up you're not going to have a baby; because adults are hypocritical about sex; because they are told not to; because it is risky and reckless; because Aids and syphilis won't happen to them; because nobody talks about it; because nobody listens; because they are 14, 15, 16, 17; because they want to, need to. And because of desire, which, put in the scale against all the epic cons, can tip it. So much of the way we think about sex in the UK is in terms of disease and dysfunction, blisters and babies. Sex education is often framed in ideology and measured by how successful it is in limiting teenage pregnancy. Young people are told by their parents and figures of authority how it happens, but why it shouldn't ('it' being one of the most common ways of not saying the word). Sex becomes smutty and forbidden, titillating and trashy. Desire, pleasure and respect are off the agenda. Nor is there any evidence that simply telling young people to abstain has any effect, rather the reverse. More knowledge means less early sex. More talk means less action. Yet among many people, there is still considerable resistance to a coherent sex-education policy and a belief that to provide sex education is to promote sexual activity. The media still blames liberal teachers and parents for lower ages of first sexual experiences. Education as corruption: the 11-year-old boy becoming a father because of what he heard in the classroom. Sex as smut, the ultimate British joke - silly and tacky. Sex as hypocrisy - it sells newspapers, TV programmes. It saturates our culture and jumps out at us from billboards, yet it is still a forbidden subject of serious debate. Sex as a double standard - boys are taught about masturbation and wet dreams; girls are taught about periods and pregnancy. Sex as something separate from relationships, and the world in which we live now. The needs of children are so dramatic and yet nobody is really talking. For many young people, sex is not a rebellion but a way of belonging, not a pleasure but a trap and a nightmare. Children 'Children are sexually educated anyway,' says Simon Blake of Sex Education Forum who on 31 October chairs a conference, 'Taking the Initiative', which will explore effective sex education. 'Whether we like it or not, they learn. They learn from all around them - from TV, newspapers and magazines, other children. Myths are ingrained and children live in a deeply sexualised culture. Even very young children are encouraged to behave in a sexual way.' The rituals of the playground have changed. Pre-teen boys and girls used to play at mummies and daddies. Now they play at going out, complicated mimicries of dating, kissing, flirting and dumping. A boy will ask a girl out, or at least his mates will ask her out for him, for this is nothing to do with friendship. 'Going out' may consist of a circuit of a playground; dumping means ignoring them the next day. Whereas Dutch children tend to have friends of both sexes, in Britain boys and girls live in parallel worlds. Girls The majority of teenage girls say they regret their first sexual encounters. Most say they first have sex because pressure is put on them by boys. Although the teenage pregnancy rate across all groups is higher than in other countries, it is much higher for those girls who don't see a future for themselves - who have academically failed, who are poor, or who are the children of very young parents. 'It is too easy just to say that sex education is a simple social exclusion issue,' says Gill Frances of the National Children's Bureau. 'But it is true that teenage pregnancy rates are up to nine times higher in poorer areas. Sex and relationship education should be an entitlement, but it won't cure the problem of social exclusion and poverty. It works the other way round. Put yourself into the mind of a young girl of 15, living in a run-down estate; she's never known what it is to feel secure, her dad's somewhere else, she's never fitted into her school, she's lonely, scared, unconfident. You can understand, can't you, why she'd have a baby.' When girls are asked why they first have sex, says Jo Adams of the Sheffield Centre of Aids and Sexual Health, they answer, \"To keep my boyfriend, to get a cuddle, to know I'm attractive, because I loved him, to get a lift home\". These reasons do not necessarily have anything to do with sex, particularly not with depressing bad sex with a partner who may not be well chosen. 'It's like looking in the fridge for feelings. You don't find out that you're attractive, intelligent or beloved in the back seat of a car or in rapid, fumbling sex behind the youth centre. Girls can get into a downward spiral of self-esteem and diminishing returns. In Jo Adams's groups of girls, the focus is on assertiveness and self-esteem. 'Which bit of no didn't you understand?' is one of the catch- phrases of the group which calls itself Girls on a Mission. Lots of the young people she works with come from poor and fractured families; they are bored, frustrated and undermined. 'One of my colleagues said that if you gave everyone a bike, there'd be a lot less sex. There's something in that.' If girls are encouraged to go cycling, play the guitar, write poetry, do yoga, practical things where they can feel successful and empowered, then they feel more in control of their lives and their futures. Horizons, which had been blotted out, open up. Success breeds success; assertiveness assertiveness. Saying no once means that it is easier to say no the second time. When teenage girls were asked how they felt after not saying no to sex when they wanted to say no, the replies were: 'Angry... anxious... despairing... resentful... tired... annoyed with myself... irritated... uncomfortable... disappointed... frustrated_ fed-up.' And after managing to say no: 'Not so scared... pleased with myself... more open with the other person... strong... satisfied...less anxious... relieved... proud of myself... lighter.' Boys Most teenage boys first have sex because pressure is put on them by other boys. 'Many boys don't report regret,' says Gill Frances, 'which doesn't mean they don't feel it. But they are under huge pressure, and frequently they wish it hadn't happened. They live in a culture in which early sexual experience is glorified. Young boys posture in front of each other. But they have real anxieties about sex.' She and Simon Blake talk of things that teenage boys have said to them: 'I was right in the middle of it, and I thought, \"What will my friends think of me now?\" I wondered what on earth I was doing and then I remembered that my friends would cheer when I walked out of the door\".' They talk about the great divide between the tough, swaggering, posturing public persona of boys in particular and the scared, unready private one: 'Culture rewards them for the public persona. These teenagers know the trap they are in and still they can't get out of it. It is too dangerous for them. Think of all the bullying and the homophobia.' Jo Adams agrees. 'Boys present a cool and streetwise image, effing and blinding and talking about girls being up for it. Conquest is part of their status. I've heard teenage boys, say: \"What's the matter with you; haven't you got a kid yet? Some kind of poofter?\" The way they talk, you'd think they were Warren Beatty, but we get them to write down in private the questions they want asked, and these great, strapping lads of 15 and 16 ask: is it all right to have wet dreams, or how long should an erect penis be? They are marshmallows inside, anxious, frightened, excited, the way we all feel when we start out on a relationship. 'What often worries me is that a lot of professionals who should know better - doctors, teachers, nurses - believe the image these lads present. They don't see beneath the surface. We've got to explore behind the fa\u00e7ade.' 'But what we need to ask,' says Gill Frances, 'is how do we talk to that private, vulnerable, tender, needy boy? How do we reach him, rather than the swaggering, cocky persona he is hiding behind? The socialisation of boys here,' she continues, 'is vile . It is very different in Scandinavia and Holland. There, there is not the same division between genders. In Holland, as many boys as girls say they have sex for love. Here, they do it because of what their mates will think. In Holland, they talk to their mother or father, go to the clinic with their partner.' Boys are more homophobic than girls. If boys are not good enough at being 'male', this has a huge and horrible impact on them at school and among their peers. By being anti-gay, they are proving their own masculinity. Boys who are clever, good at school, into certain types of music, who are too small, too pretty, whose voices are not deep enough, who like the company of girls, these are the boys who are going to have a tough time. Jo Adams thinks that while feminism has given girls a way of thinking about their sexuality, there's no equivalent for boys: 'Just Iron John beating his chest in the woods, or Wet New Man. Feminists had to slog; they took risks. There are some boys taking risks now, and they are vilified.' Parents Most children say that they want to learn about sex from their parents first, but a lot of adults are ignorant about sex themselves. Simon Blake says that adults often ask questions like: 'How do I know if I've had an orgasm? Am I putting it in the right hole? Where does a period come from? Will I get pregnant if I swallow sperm?' One of the reasons that Holland and Scandinavia are so much more successful in their sex education than we are is because parents talk more and more openly to their children. Here, even when we are reasonably confident with the biology, we are inadequate with the relationships. Yet all the research shows that children want the facts to come out of talking through feelings. They want to talk about sex as important and connected with the rest of their life, not just as a mechanical act but an emotional one, as something that is special and prized. 'If you talk about it as mucky and round the back, you do it mucky and round the back,' says Gill Frances. 'Don't talk to them about your own sex lives or ask directly about theirs,' says Simon Blake. 'Talk generally; come at the matter sideways. Discuss sexual relationships in general. It's tough to talk about our own sex lives, but it's easy and safe and not embarrassing to think about other people's lives and problems, or chat about dilemmas facing characters in soap operas.' He describes a recent confrontation between a mother and son. Son (genuinely wanting to initiate a debate): 'When do you think you're old enough to have sex?' Mother (terrified): ' I hope you're not doing it .' Son (who wasn't) probably goes out and does 'it'. It is often preferable for fathers to talk to sons, mothers to daughters. 'Women don't necessarily understand male sexuality,' says Gill Frances, 'so they often pitch it wrong. If a boy says, \"I keep having erections\" the mother might say, \"That's disgusting, you should show more respect\", whereas the father's more likely to say, \"Only 10 a day!\" He would normalise it, take away the anxiety and the shame. Liz Wilson works with a group in Sheffield called Parents Together Project; her official title is 'voluntary parent peer educator'. She has been trained as an educator and now works with parent groups, either for a single, two-hour session or over four week, to help them feel more confident about the way they are talking to and listening to their children. 'It's really about enabling better communication between parents and kids,' she says, 'but focusing on sexual relationships.' Her own children are seven, 10 and 13. She has conversations with each of them, from the 'Where do I come from' questions, through to puberty, wet dreams, being gay. 'Before I did the training,' she says, 'my approach was that I would always answer any questions that they asked me openly, honestly, without embarrassment. But, you know, there are loads of questions they simply don't ask, and we need to encourage parents to bring up the subject, but in a natural kind of way.' She gives as an example a situation with her 13-year-old son: 'We were watching a TV drama and everyone was leaping in and out of bed with each other, and I asked, \"What do you think about that? Should they have had sex with each other so quickly?\" I'm not saying, \"What's going on in your sex life?\" but rather trying to look with him at issues around sex and relationships. 'Young people are entitled to their secrets and parents need to respect that, just as I wouldn't tell my children about my own sexual practices. We should go at things obliquely - it's often better to talk while not looking at each other. Talk when you're cooking, walking, driving along in a car. And,' she adds, 'talk about sex as something that can be wonderful, pleasurable, important.' She says she thinks boys have a raw deal. 'Mums and daughters talk more, and they have more starting points, like the start of menstruation, obviously. Boys have no real starting point. And they have much more pressure. There are lots of ways for a girl to be a girl, but only one way for a boy to be a boy. I think it's rotten for them.' Schools Sex education is on the national curriculum in secondary schools now, but only the reproductive and hormonal parts - 'The stuff about making babies,' as Gill Frances puts it. All the rest - friendship, self-esteem, desire, disease, everything that may enable a child to think about becoming an adult, everything that may give children pause - is taught under PSHE and is voluntary. In a strange way, we are moralistic about sex, and yet in sex education we take it out of its moral context, making it clinical and alien. 'Too little, too late, too biological,' says Jo Adams. 'Not enough about emotions, which is what all young people say they need and want. Not about being jealous, getting dumped, being scared, body-image, rage, shame, guilt, being laughed at.' Gill Frances talks about the school as the place where the 'jigsaw' that the parents have started gets filled in, and where skills must be developed and practised with a peer group. 'We need to get to kids before the rest of the world gets to them. Of course,' she adds, 'the pre-giggle stage is younger and younger. Teachers, who are often untrained and squeeze PSHE into \"guidance\" sessions and circle time, remain anxious about sex education because they are often operating on the blurred line of the law. One hard-pressed teacher told me that at her school of course they hardly teach any sex education at all.' John Tripp of Exeter University has a more behaviourist approach to sex education. 'Knowledge is simply not enough. We need a kind of social learning.' He is the founder of A Pause (Added Power and Understanding in Sex Education), whose programme is to be delivered to all secondary schools in north and east Devon. He believes that abstaining from sexual activity, even for a few months, is extremely beneficial to young people. Traditional sex education, he says, is bound to be problematic. Teachers have not had the training, have no methodology to deal with it confidently. The clich\u00e9 of the young female teacher in a class full of snickering teenage boys is often also the truth. Also, he says, schools are largely 'places of fact. Teachers are not usually required to deal with relationships and feelings'. He also claims that there is no evidence that the plain facts influence teenagers' behaviour one way or the other. 'Behaviour is largely dependent on what you see around you. What you see,' he adds, 'is often not the truth - young people often think that everyone except them is having sex, because they say that they are, whereas, of course, most of them aren't. Part of A Pause's work is to demolish the myths.' A Pause uses out-of-school professionals (they have more credibility than teachers) and 16- to-19-year-olds to deliver sex education. The class becomes more collaborative and open. It is split into small groups; role-plays are encouraged. Tripp has even coined the term 'outercourse' (as opposed to intercourse), as a way of encouraging young people to hold off from early and unhappy sex. 'We are not trying to make them toe the line. We're not indoctrinating young people against sexual activity. We are trying to help their self-efficacy skills, so that they actually do what they want and believe in, rather than become swamped by social pressure.

Take it out from under the proscriptions of religious leaders.' 'We aren't honest with young people,' says Gill Frances. 'We tell them to say no, but we don't tell them that sex is far more difficult to refuse than chocolate. We say: watch out! Be careful. We say it's dangerous. We don't say it's fun, pleasurable, lovely, important, but there are problems. Sex education is not just about knowledge and finding information; it's about finding ways of talking to children and listening to them.' 'But it's hard to talk about sex,' says Jo Adams. 'We talk about emotions, we talk about family, work, food, holidays and verrucas... there's a great silence surrounding sex. We don't even talk with our partners - we have sex with them, but we can't say the words. 'And one of the things we struggle with is that sex does need to be risky in some ways. So how do we create a context in sex education that enables a young person to take risks safely.' 'It's about emotional intelligence,' says Gill Frances, 'and the power to name feelings, to be able to say, \"I'm scared and in need. I'm lonely. Please help\".' 'It's about talking,' says Jo Adams. 'Start with talking.' 'And,' says Gill Frances, 'it's about saying we have to change the world.'

Between a third and a half of sexually active teenagers do not use contraceptives during first sexual intercourse. There is less syphilis in Sweden than in a single STD clinic in London. In Holland, 40 per cent of boys discuss contraception with their girlfriends before sex; in UK, it's 15 per cent. More than 50 per cent of 14- to 15-year-olds are not taught anatomy fully, despite many of them being sexually active already. A recent survey showed teenagers think there is too much emphasis in sex education on the 'mechanics' and not enough on emotions In Britain, there seems to be a strange disconnection between sex and pleasure: in most first sexual experiences, either the girl (two or three in every four), or both the girl and boy regret the encounter.

'As a team, if we felt there was genuinely someone with a conflicting edge, we would conflict them out, just like with a board of directors. It is quite normal.' Couldn't that mean that all six could find themselves leaving a meeting at some point. 'In theory I suppose that is correct but I don't think that will happen,' Crozier adds. </p> <p>He insists that the FA - he and 'one or two' members of the panel - will be taking professional advice over the next 10 days to two weeks. 'We want to go out and get expert advice,' he says. 'We talk a lot about public opinion and, yes, that is one thing and I wouldn't decry it, but what is more important is expert opinion. We will talk to people in the game and say, \"You have been England manager before...\", \"some of you may have managed top clubs and players...\". We need to understand what they think. We are not saying, \"Make the decision for us\", we are just asking their opinions.' </p> <p>Crozier says that the process will then involve reporting back to the panel as a whole and coming up with a short list - of two or three names, he expects. He will then approach the men named. It will avoid, he says, the confusion of some five years ago when the then chief executive Graham Kelly's emissary, Jimmy Armfield, canvassed opinion, and 'four or five people thought they had been offered the job'. </p> <p>It is a start, and Crozier is to be commended for insisting that this time the FA will put their foot on the ball rather than react with a jerk of the knee as they did a year before his own appointment and the result was the knee-jerk management of Keegan. The current approach smacks of fudging and expediency, however. </p> <p>Now Crozier may be young, Scottish and from a non-football background, but his instincts and utterances seem sound.

Crozier probably meant nothing of the sort, except that he would be the one who finally settled the contract. More probably, he wanted to facilitate the appointment being made more professionally by people with insider knowledge. Take these statements. </p> <p>'I don't think in the past people have put enough thought into talking to the individual about what their philosophy is, how they would handle the job, who they might have with them, their experience, how they feel about outside pressures, the difference between club and international management.' </p> <p>And: 'What was interesting when I arrived was how little time people spent talking about football.

      "body": "<p>Winning the World Cup is not down to chance, it's the result of hard work, a will to follow a strong policy, a search for superior football. If somebody wants to copy our system they must start by developing the blueprint, developing the coaches, and developing the players. These are the essentials. Today my role involves supervising the education of tomorrow's coaches, then they form the players. This is what technical direction is. We are the only ones in Europe to do this and it was started by Gerard Houllier. He created a special diploma for youth coaches called formateurs. They number 80 to 100 and every year they come back to the Federation to learn more. It's an ongoing thing. </p> <p>The main reason we won the World Cup is we had an exceptional generation of players and they are the fruits of a policy that was put together more than 30 years ago by the French Football Federation. We were very lucky to have had a group of people in charge who projected a great view of the future, knowing that if we wanted to be competitive we had to be organised. </p> <p>Georges Boulogne [national coach from 1969-73] had the idea to create a national technical direction. At the time, French football wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. He put the structures in place, and developed a whole line of thinking, a philosophy. He recently died, and thank God he saw France become world champions. </p> <p>He created what we call the formation , the development of young players - an enormous revolution. At the time, people didn't understand because the clubs were obliged to take it on and suddenly they had to find people to look after the kids and wondered what to do about school. </p> <p>Today we have very well prepared new young players. We are under-18 world champions. With the growing influence of agents, huge contracts and star lifestyles, it is increasingly difficult to ensure the boys sustain a sporting attitude. But the beauty of our way of working is that even if you are a young star, if you don't have the will to work properly you are dismissed immediately without the possibility of returning. For me, football is a way of life. You have to be very professional: you can't just do it lightly. </p> <p>Our help in this way doesn't stop once the players become professional. Imagine, for example, the potential for Patrick Vieira. I hope, if he continues his progression, in two years he will be the best player in Europe, or even the world. It's all in his head. If he keeps his ambition, enthusiasm, will power, he will do that. If he stops, he goes down. It's our role, and that's where we come in, to tell them to be very demanding of themselves. </p> <p>At the heart of the French system is Clairfontaine, our base in a chateau outside Paris. It was a great decision to create a home for football, from the kids to the professionals. Clairfontaine helps to bring everyone together and unites the work and the philosophy of French football. It's a meeting place for the football family. Even the referees go there for a get-together every year. At the FFF, we put the collective ideal first. That was the hardest thing to put together. The French are well known for being individual, egotistical, Latin blooded. But football showed us victory is a collective effort. </p> <p>The day will come when England have to kick start themselves, when they realise things can't carry on as they are. Maybe you need to change some views, as we did. The job was so enormous it took us more than 10 years to do it. It takes about eight to 10 years to bring a player to maturity in football. </p> <p>I am not worried about England. It's a football country, the roots of football. I can't see why it couldn't quickly put together its own formula. It doesn't have to be like the French. One of our biggest mistakes was that we tried to copy what happened elsewhere. You have to take what's good for you but not an entire system. </p> <p>But first of all you have to want to do it. Everyone in football's family has to agree in this. Even in France we still have to fight every day to keep developing. Howard Wilkinson - a good friend of Gerard Houllier - knows how it works in France. But he may put something together that is even better than our system. </p> <p>Since I began to work here in 1992, we have benefited from what was done before. What we missed was to be winners. I arrived at a crossroads. The players coming through the system were well groomed, educated and - crucially - increasingly competitive. This is why in the Nineties we've improved, because French people are not naturally competitive. </p> <p>Our football was already moving in the right direction but there was a major setback in 1993, the famous elimination from the World Cup when Bulgaria stopped us from qualifying in the last minute. It put a stop to everything. I was part of that mission and I thought it was finished for me. We had lost, the coach and main man, Gerard Houllier, stepped down, we were really disappointed. But it helped us in the end, that defeat. We could sit down, understand and go forward. </p> <p>Sometimes you have to accept missing a big tournament to ensure a stronger long-term future. Sometimes you have to be more realistic. Your goals shouldn't be sky high straight away. In order to create the right dynamic between players and coaches you need to lower your immediate goals, to make sure everybody is working together. In our sport we need solidarity. You can't do it on your own. </p> <p>People were sceptical when I took over, because I was part of the team that lost. We learned from our errors, the mistakes we made preparing the team, relating to the players, in the way people were living day to day in the French team. Rather than look at winning the World Cup straight away you have to learn the basics, and do the basics. That's what we did. We did it when the press was really against us, even not very honest at times, but we never changed our route. </p> <p>People like Kevin Keegan, Franz Beckenbauer, all the greats, they are doubted all the time. But thank God for that, because it helps you to go forward. Doubts should be a positive not a negative thing. Positive doubts make us think about how to improve. </p> <p>You need patience, but you know for a fact that when you are at a high level nobody is prepared to wait. The only people who were ready to be patient were people from the football world, who appreciated what I was doing. Nobody else believed in us, that we could do something massive. The fans and the media didn't understand, which is normal. What I needed, and got, was the support and means to do my job properly. I did exactly what I wanted to do. All we knew was that we shouldn't waste time - we had a main goal, which was the World Cup coming to France. We always remained focused but it was hard because we had Euro 96 before the World Cup. </p> <p>First, I wanted to create a group dynamic to take to the European championship. I wanted to finish in the top four of Europe. We did that, and then we realised we had great players in the team. Seventeen of that team played in big European teams, but we had to make them play together and give them a style of play. That was really difficult between 1996 and 1998 because we didn't have any competitive games as World Cup hosts. </p> <p>Strength, enthusiasm, conviction. These are the fundamental qualities a coach requires if he aims to win the World Cup. If you don't have these three things then you can't go beyond yourself, which is what you must do to win something big. </p> <p>Last summer I had no frustrations watching the team win the European championship from the background. I was so happy that the players I put together achieved this amazing thing. It was wonderful. I lived the tournament much better than 98 because I was more of a fan, a friend, than the decision maker. Seeing the fruition of what I worked with since 1993 was an extreme satisfaction and happiness, probably more than if I was manager. </p> <p>Now we have big responsibilities to prepare for tomorrow and we have new ideas - essential if we need to progress. It's easier to get to the top than to stay there. Motivation hasn't stopped because we want to keep our World Cup in 2002. You always need new goals. We never think about the past, we think about the future because football is constantly progressing. Think about African football, Asian football, it's formidable. If we think in Europe we are the best, we are not going to be the best forever. It's like us being world champions - if we believe that we'll stand still and we want to win it again. </p> <p><em>Aim\u00e9 Jacquet was talking to Amy Lawrence</em>.</p>",

First, I wanted to create a group dynamic to take to the European championship. I wanted to finish in the top four of Europe. We did that, and then we realised we had great players in the team. Seventeen of that team played in big European teams, but we had to make them play together and give them a style of play. That was really difficult between 1996 and 1998 because we didn't have any competitive games as World Cup hosts. Strength, enthusiasm, conviction. These are the fundamental qualities a coach requires if he aims to win the World Cup. If you don't have these three things then you can't go beyond yourself, which is what you must do to win something big. Last summer I had no frustrations watching the team win the European championship from the background. I was so happy that the players I put together achieved this amazing thing. It was wonderful. I lived the tournament much better than 98 because I was more of a fan, a friend, than the decision maker. Seeing the fruition of what I worked with since 1993 was an extreme satisfaction and happiness, probably more than if I was manager. Now we have big responsibilities to prepare for tomorrow and we have new ideas - essential if we need to progress. It's easier to get to the top than to stay there. Motivation hasn't stopped because we want to keep our World Cup in 2002. You always need new goals. We never think about the past, we think about the future because football is constantly progressing. Think about African football, Asian football, it's formidable. If we think in Europe we are the best, we are not going to be the best forever. It's like us being world champions - if we believe that we'll stand still and we want to win it again.

He also happens to be the FA's technical director - a leading coach acknowledged and respected by most of the European names being bandied about as contenders for the England job - and as such deserves a big say in the debate about who follows Kevin Keegan. </p> <p>As even a little say from Wilkinson tends to be interminable many will be reluctant to grant him this, but there is no point having a technical director if his views on the coaching structure are ignored. Now is the time for the FA either to listen to what Wilkinson has to say, or come clean and admit they only appointed him because the job title sounded trendy. </p> <p>The early signs are that Wilkinson is whistling in the wind. After the uninspiring draw in Finland on Wednesday night, he suggested the two most important requirements for the next England manager were a) availability, and b) a 'deep, deep wish to take on the challenge'. A couple of days later, the FA let it be known that it might be the end of the season before an appointment is made, which immediately suggests two things: first, that 'available' candidates such as Terry Venables are not being considered, and secondly that the manager they have in mind may currently be far more committed to his club. </p> <p>Wilkinson himself falls into the category of 'available', of course, having not yet realised that he will never be taken completely seriously until he has dropped his all too apparent ambition of managing England full-time. There are dozens of reasons why Wilkinson should never manage England again, even in an emergency, from the ludicrous decision that Emile Heskey with a bad back was somehow preferable to the fresh legs of Michael Owen against Finland, to the fiasco of last season's under-21 international at Fulham when thousands of young fans were invited to come to watch Joe Cole only for Wilkinson to keep him on the bench until the second half. More seriously, the ousting of the promising Peter Taylor as under-21 coach now looks an even poorer piece of judgment than it did at the time, especially from a man espousing the need for continuity and a system where junior coaches can be promoted from within. </p> <p>For all these reasons, it is easy to laugh at Wilkinson, and for the past few days that is what his shriller critics have been doing. There was a particular feeding-frenzy when Wilkinson surprisingly admitted it might be necessary to be realistic about 2002 World Cup hopes (ie write them off) in order to get a new team and a coherent system in place for the 2006 event. Surprisingly because those words immediately translated into 'Let's surrender' type headlines, not because his thought process was faulty. </p> <p>This is a point of view that has been put to the past two or three England managers, and Wilkinson deserves credit for being brave enough to admit the truth instead of hiding behind wishful patriotism. </p> <p>When the question was put to Keegan, for instance, his reaction was to turn on the questioner, defend his players, and declare that England would be sending out a team to win Euro 2000. From that point on (a couple of days after the miserable defeat by Scotland in the second leg of the play-off) Keegan's days were numbered. It might be argued such a public statement of belief in his team's ability was motivational or confidence-building, but the effect was simply to pile more pressure on players who already knew they were under-performing. </p> <p>The last thing England need is another manager to arrive and say we have the players to win in Japan and Korea. Because we don't. Results like Wednesday's in Helsinki are not disappointing aberrations, they are the norm. Impressions gathered from the past few days that England are not as good as Germany, about level with Finland and worried about Albania picking up more points are not misleading. England fans know this and many of them would like to see what some of our better young players can do. Foreign coaches, not blinded by the false lustre of the Premiership, have no difficulty perceiving that England managers have to struggle along with hardly any players, which is why so few are beating a path to the FA's door. </p> <p>On the whole it was encouraging to see the FA admit the time might have come for foreign assistance, since that in itself is a huge step towards dismantling our absurdly arrogant world view and placing English football more realistically within the global game, though there are reasons why this may not be the right time to embrace overseas aid. One is that the vast majority of people calling for a foreign coach have in mind one of the outstanding examples already in the Premiership - Sir Alex Ferguson or Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.</p> <p>If either of those two can be prevailed upon to take the job then fine, England will be in good hands. If not, and both men have distanced themselves from the speculation, there is considerably less enthusiasm for the sort of foreign coach who might actually come from abroad and therefore need maybe a season or so to familiarise himself with the language and the location of Premiership grounds. If England want to qualify for 2002 they need a coach, of whatever nationality, who can hit the ground running. If they are going to take Wilkinson's advice and make rebuilding a priority, there are English coaches who can perform the task. 'The perception is that English coaches are nowhere near as good as their French, Dutch and Italian counterparts,' Wilkinson said. 'We have to address that - and the crop of youngsters we have at the moment is a big bonus, and one that reflects well on English coaching.' </p> <p>The second problem with the foreign option is that it is based on the same woolly thinking that got Keegan the job: the dangerous idea that one man with his clipboard, his charisma or his superior grasp of tactics can lead England into the light. One man is not going to change anything. The FA will obviously try to compensate for the Keegan blunder by bringing in a coldly analytical coach with a professorship in tactics, but there seems little point in persuading Sven-Goran Eriksson to leave Lazio, for example, without putting a structure in place to support him. International coaches can only use the players they have, and England's present squad are patently not good enough. </p> <p>Even Venables, on paper the obvious choice, would notice the difference between now and 1996. The foreign invasion of the Premiership only really started after Euro 96, with Chelsea and Middlesbrough leading the way. When Tel was last selecting his England sides, between 1994 and 1996, Blackburn were winning the Premiership with a largely homespun team and Bruce Rioch was manager of Arsenal. Now, apart from David Beckham and Michael Owen, all the top acts are from overseas. Since England's success in Euro 96 gave the Premiership a crucial boost, the domestic league has been unable to return the favour and for some time now its bought-in glamour has persuaded people to overlook our shortcomings at international level. This is not to say Venables should not be given the job - in my view he should have had it since Glenn Hoddle's departure - just to point out it is a trifle simplistic to expect him to snap his fingers and restore normality. </p> <p>The best plan would be to listen to Wilkinson and use the next two or three years wisely. England are already struggling to qualify for 2002 - no one in their right mind imagines we are going to impress anyone even if we get there - so what is there to lose by being realistic? 'We've got to stop this knee-jerk business,' Wilkinson said. 'It doesn't help when coaches come in and make rash boasts, but a lot of them are scared to paint a realistic picture. They would only get panned in the press for being defeatist anyway. There would be a lot of that too if we picked a team for four years ahead and didn't do too well in the intervening competitions, but if it is the right thing to do the press and the public will just have to stand for it. What is the alternative, to just keep riding this roller-coaster and getting nowhere?' </p> <p>This might be the most sensible thing an England manager has said since Bobby Robson confided that Paul Gascoigne was daft as a brush. The managerial succession is not really the issue here. Get a good old 'un, and Robson himself springs to mind, to work with a good young 'un like Taylor or Alan Curbishley, and make the future the priority instead of the present. It is possible to argue that players like Owen and Rio Ferdinand have actually gone backwards since France 98. The FA's first duty is not to find a new manager. It is to make sure the same thing does not happen to Joe Cole, Steve Gerrard, Kieron Dyer, Gareth Barry, Wes Brown and Richard Wright, all of whom should join Beckham, Owen and Ferdinand in the team to face Italy next month.</p>",

In its first five years it received grants of \u00a310,000 from the Irish government and \u00a340,000 from the British government, but it has been very hard to carry on. A group comprising members of parliament in London and Dublin held a meeting with David Blunkett and, as a result, the Secretary of State for Education agreed to allocate \u00a3150,000 to the Warrington Project. The group has been asked to put forward proposals that might be incorporated into a new Citizenship Course in secondary schools which is due to start in two years time. The importance of the Ireland in Schools scheme and the possibility of applying it much more widely to promote understanding between different racial groups has already been recognised outside Warrington. Several universities have already incorporated the programme into teacher-training courses. The work of these teachers and academics has particular resonances in the week when the Runnymede Trust published the report of its Commission on the Future of Multi Ethnic Britain. The report argues that the whole concept of Britishness needs to be rethought in a way which takes account of enormous range of races, accents and attitudes in the UK.

      "bodyText": "The case of lecturer Richard Griffiths, cleared last week of raping a student in what seemed a classic example of date rape, proves just how dangerous the amorphous relationship between lecturers and students can be. We will probably never know what really happened that night but the intimate manner in which the two were socialising throws up questions about the delicate relationship between lecturers and students ignored for far too long already. There are no national guidelines covering such friendships. Teachers jeopardise their careers if they have affairs with schoolchildren, and doctors risk being struck off, but lecturers are subject only to the idiosyncratic rules of their employers. At first glance, this might seem reasonable: undergraduates are not underage schoolchildren after all and nor do they physically and mentally depend on their lecturers as patients do upon doctors. On the contrary, undergraduates are among the most intelligent members of society. They are mature enough to choose an academic discipline to inform their future and are free to choose their lifestyle, their politics and their friends. They wear clothes in which the majority of the population wouldn't be seen dead and abuse their health in ways they will struggle to recall for the rest of their lives. Surely, such paragons of empowerment and independence can choose who will share their bed? Well, yes and no. Undergraduates may give the impression that they are waterproof, bulletproof and bombproof but in reality, they are often the most vulnerable members of society. Undergraduates are told again and again that their college years will be - must be - the best of their lives. They expect to spend their days entangled in passionate and erudite debates and their nights in decadent transportations of delight. They expect to wade knee-deep in kindred spirits from freshers' week on and take it as read that they will discover the love of their life shortly afterwards. The reality is sharply and depressingly different. A study released last month found that one university student in six suffers from chronic loneliness during his or her first year, causing at least one quarter to consider leaving. Loneliness is the root cause of problems including self-doubt, poor physical health (exacerbated by being responsible for one's diet in an atmosphere where beer has precedence over bread) and depression. Take the typical female student then, isolated and upset and place her in a position of surprising intimacy - one to one in a small room, week after week and often late at night - with a male tutor who appears mature, concerned and in control. It should be no surprise to anyone that female undergraduates fall for their tutors in droves. Sometimes, of course, genuine relationships can blossom but even these must struggle to overcome the initial inequality where all power rested in the hands of the older man. At the moment, universities risk the ire of their staff if they attempt to dictate the type of relationship they can and cannot enter into with their students. The introduction of national guidelines, however, would give them the confidence and authority to stand their ground while ringfencing their right to interpret each case individually. Because it is not just students who would benefit from national guidelines: if a student accuses a tutor of abuse in the wake of a messy end to a genuine relationship, for example, the slur can devastate his career. Griffiths, unpleasant as he may be, has been found innocent but his days of teaching were over the moment his name hit the headlines. Whatever the truth of the tale, two lives have been ruined in the past week. National guidelines would have protected all of those involved as well as the thousands of students and lecturers who continue to tred the knife edge.

      "body": "<p>Those three little words no one wants to hear: you have cancer. The depth of the dread is probably why so many of us know so little about it, preferring to muck around with myths and half-truths. Both my parents had it. My wife is fully recovered from a skin melanoma. One of my best friends survived bowel cancer in his mid-twenties. And still my ignorance was wilfully deep.</p> <p>Nor is it just us civilians who feel that way. \"Even the medical profession hides from the truth,\" the doctor in our family told me. </p> <p>\"I had an old and highly respected Harley Street specialist come to me and say he'd had bleeding from his rectum for some time - what might be wrong? Of course he knew it was colorectal cancer. He just didn't want to know. And when you tell people they have cancer, they ask as few questions as possible.\"</p> <p>So let's tackle the questions we all find so hard to ask - and uncover the truth behind some of our myths.</p> <p><strong> 1 You can catch it just like you catch a cold </strong></p> <p>No, it's not a droplet disease. Nor is it water-borne like, say, cholera. But it's possible to catch diseases and viruses which can lead to it. Around 15% of cancers worldwide are caused this way. Cervical cancer, for example, is virtually always (99.7%) a consequence of HPV, a sexually transmitted infection. Liver cancer is 100 times more likely in hepatitis B victims - which is why it's one of the few cancers where the Third World has a lead over us. The major risk factor is that babies are infected by their mothers. </p> <p><strong> 2 Flying gives you leukaemia</strong></p> <p>Only if you are a long-term commercial pilot - in which case you are five times more likely to get it. The effect is related to the high number of hours flown and only applies to those who have put in more than 5,000 hours. Even serial business flyers like Rupert Murdoch don't rack up hours like that, so it's a purely professional risk. It's most likely caused by cosmic radiation which increases with altitude. So the higher you fly, the more marked the effect - presumably Concorde pilots ran (or flew) the greatest risk. The link was established by Dr Hans Storm of the Institute of Epidemiology, Copenhagen. \"The only way to avoid it,\" he said, \"would be to limit the number of hours pilots are allowed to fly, just as they do with nuclear workers.\" Airline pilots are also three times as likely to get skin cancer, but that's because they take more holidays in the sun.</p> <p><strong> 3 City life gives you cancer</strong></p> <p>No, there is no difference in incidence rate between our towns and our countryside. The same doesn't seem to be true, though, for survival rates. An Aberdeen University study found that rural Scots with stomach cancer were four times more likely to die before it was diagnosed. For breast cancer, it's three times. Why? Because country dwellers have worse access to specialist care than their town cousins.</p> <p><strong> 4 It's man-made chemicals that are to blame</strong></p> <p>Not really. Epidemiologists look elsewhere for the causes, by and large. The BMA estimates that 1 per cent of cancers are caused by food additives. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) says no more than 1% of all cancers are a result of man-made chemicals. It's true that a 1999 German report and a more recent one by the US Environmental Protection Agency pointed the finger at dioxins, even coming up with a figure of their being responsible for 12% of human cancers in industrialised countries. Other scientists, while not disputing that dioxins are poisonous, doubt that they are ingested in sufficient quantities and point out that there is no causal link evidence. There is no real evidence of increased cancers in Seveso, site of the worst dioxin exposure and the much-vaunted leukaemia link with water pollution in Worcester, Massachusetts - as recounted in the movie A Civil Action - is almost certainly false. Staggeringly, a majority of US citizens, when polled by the Discovery Channel, said they thought air pollution carried as big a cancer risk as heavy smoking. That's pretty much on a level with thinking the moon's made of green cheese. Still, maybe it's no coincidence. Believing some nasty big business out there is to blame for cancer has two advantages - it stops being your responsibility and, perhaps more importantly in the lawyer-heavy US, it affords you the opportunity to sue the bejaysus out of them. </p> <p><strong> 5 There is more and more and more of it around</strong></p> <p>Well, yes, but this is mostly because more of us live longer. It's overwhelmingly a disease of age - nearly two-thirds of all cancers occur in the over-65s. Also, fewer of us are dying of other diseases - and, death being death, we've all got to die of something. Still, even the age-standardised rates have risen. From 1971 to 1997, levels rose 13% in men and 34% in women. More recently, though, there has been a significant decline in male cancer - down 5.75% since 1994. This is probably because of the long-term drop in lung cancer rates - down 33% from 1986 to 1997. Female cancers, though, have risen a little recently, but they're still below their 1992 peak. In the US, by the way, it's fallen even faster - 10% down overall since the 1992 peak. </p> <p><strong> 6 Every second person seems to have it</strong></p> <p>Almost. In the US, 48% of men and 37% of women will get cancer at some point during their life. The UK figure is a little lower. According to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF), just over one in three will get it, one in four will die of it. Currently, the male five-year survival rate is just 31%, while the female is 43%. Five years is the cancer experts' preferred definition of \"survival\".</p> <p><strong> 7 There was some blood in my stools for a bit, but then it stopped, so I haven't got cancer</strong></p> <p>Maybe, maybe not. Cancerous polyps do bleed intermittently. </p> <p><strong> 8 Cervical cancer is a promiscuity thing</strong></p> <p>Afraid so. The younger a woman is when she first has sex and the more sexual partners she has in her lifetime, the greater her chance of getting cervical cancer. That's because it's one of the few cancers caused by something you can catch. More than 99% of women who get it have the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Male promiscuity is also a major cause - women who've only had one partner also get HPV. Male promiscuity, combined with lower hygiene levels, is often the problem in the Third World - men catch HPV from prostitutes and infect their wives and lovers. Colombia, for example, has the world's highest rate. There is an HPV test, but trials have had varying results. In some, it's proved accurate. In others, it has produced a number of both false-positives and false-negatives - though the trials weren't large enough to establish whether the numbers were unacceptably large. As recently as September 1999, Dr Peter Sasieni of the ICRF said that adding it routinely \"would certainly lead to greatly increased costs without necessarily significantly decreasing the amount of cancers\". However, both he and the ICRF now believe \"that HPV testing holds great promise as a primary screening method. It has an abnormality detection rate of about 90%, compared with 75 or less for a smear test.\" Currently, it's being tested on borderline cases - still 250,000 a year. Cervical screening is already working. It cut cases by 42% between 1988 and 1997, and deaths have fallen by 50% in the last 15 years.</p> <p><strong> 9 Male circumcision prevents cervical cancer</strong></p> <p>There is some evidence for this. In India, Muslim women have a lower rate of cervical cancer than Hindus and Christians. It certainly seems to prevent penile cancer, which is virtually never seen in circumcised men.</p> <p><strong> 10 I've got genital warts: that means cervical cancer somewhere down the line, right?</strong></p> <p>Almost certainly not. When it comes to cervical cancer, if you can see the problem with the naked eye, it means you haven't got a problem. Nasty but true. More than 60 variants of HPV have been identified. Genital warts are produced by HPV Types 6 and 11, which have no link with cervical cancer. The danger ones are HPV 16, 18, 33, 35 and 45. The big problem is they're mostly \"silent\". Many of us have these HPVs, very few of us know it - a big deal when your chances with cervical cancer are directly related to the disease's progress by the time of diagnosis. Have a pap smear, basically. Because, in the words of the American National Cancer Institute, \"properly treated, tumour control of cervical cancer should be nearly 100%\".</p> <p><strong> 11 Extremely overweight people are more likely to develop it</strong></p> <p>Some American sources say there is a connection between obesity and cancer. The ICRF says the link is not clear. There are two exceptions, though. Obese women are three to five times more likely to get endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer and obese post-menopausal women run an increased risk of breast cancer.</p> <p><strong> 12 More men die of testicular cancer than women do of breast cancer</strong></p> <p>Not so. Testicular cancer is a very rare disease. It accounts for just one per cent of male cancers - in England and Wales in 1999, 71 died of it, compared with the 11,548 women who died of breast cancer. Incidence has doubled over the last 20 years - though it may now be on the decline since a 1996 peak. It is one of the few cancers that attacks the young. Nine out of 10 cases are in under-55s - and non-descended testicles by the age of seven is a strong indicator for it. The survival rate is excellent, however - almost 95%.</p> <p><strong> 13 OK then, more men die of prostate cancer than women of breast cancer</strong></p> <p>Wrong again, though the figures are a little closer. Breast cancer is the leading killer disease for women between 35 and 54. According to the Office for National Statistics, the lifetime risk is one in nine. Prostate cancer, by contrast, is a one in 14 shot - still 10,000 deaths a year, with a 41% survival rate. Breast cancer survival rates are rapidly improving, though. It kills some 13,000 British women a year, of the 35,000 who develop it. But that is far better than it was. Since the late 80s, when we had one of the lowest survival rates in Europe, deaths have fallen by 30%, faster than anywhere else in the world. That was from a very high starting point, though, so more women are still dying in Britain than in America, Australia and some of Europe.</p> <p><strong> 14 Breast cancer is killing more and more young women</strong></p> <p>Definitely not. Death rates have been reduced by 30% in young and middle-aged victims - mostly because of the efficacy of tamoxifen, a cheap and effective drug which blocks hormone receptors on cancer cells, interfering with their growth. It probably saves more lives than any other form of non-surgical cancer treatment. In younger women, chemotherapy after surgery has made a big difference to death rates.</p> <p><strong> 15 Left-handers are more likely to get breast cancer, so are virgins</strong></p> <p>Yes and yes. The left-hand difference - which is \"modest\" - was reported in the journal Epidemiology. A suggestion is that there is a link to the hypothesis that intrauterine exposure to steroid hormones may play a role in the development of breast cancer, as well as influencing handedness. Virgins are more likely to get it because they don't have children. Breast cancer is closely linked to oestrogen levels. Asian women in Asia, for example, have low levels of both - and British women high ones. Having babies, particularly when you're young, lowers the risk. By contrast, the fewer children you have, the greater your risk. Other risks are late menopause and having a first child after 30 - the older you are, the greater the danger. According to Dr Hilakivi-Clarke of the AICR, it now seems that the impact of high oestrogen levels varies through a woman's life. In the reproductive years, they have no effect at all. In the womb and after menopause, they increase the risk. During childhood, they now appear to play a \"powerful protective role\". </p> <p><strong> 16 Routine mammograms are a waste of time for over-65s</strong></p> <p>No, says the US. Yes, said the ICRF till just the other week - \"There is no good medical reason to justify the decision.\" No, it now says. In the last week of September, the government announced that routine screening would be extended to 65- to 70-year-olds by 2004.</p> <p><strong> 17 I've got a painful lump in my breast, so I must have cancer</strong></p> <p>Most likely not - 90% of breast cancer tumours are not painful, according to a clinician. It is far more likely to be an abscess, which is then always painful.</p> <p><strong> 18 Every man, if he lived long enough, would eventually get prostate cancer</strong></p> <p>Probably. The death toll has doubled over the last 20 years, and in 20 years' time, 50,000 men a year will get it. According to Dr Peter Sasieni, statistician for the ICRF, 40% of all 80-year-old men have it - this was established through post-mortems. Many won't know they've got it, as it develops slowly and they'll die of something else first. \"You can assume that the incidence increases with age. So if men lived to over 120 or so, it is possible they would all get prostate cancer.\" But not necessarily die of it. It looks as if there could well be a form of prostate cancer that just sits there and grows very slowly.</p> <p><strong> 19 The PSA test has transformed the survival rate for prostate cancer</strong></p> <p>The jury's out on this. In the US, prostate cancer deaths have dropped 10% since the early 90s - both experts and patient groups attribute this to the prostate-specific antigen test (PSA) which is a simple blood test. Experts here are nowhere near as convinced, pointing out the test's low accuracy level - it produces an unacceptable number of both false-positives and false-negatives. One of the big problems is figuring out whether a tumour is aggressive or not. New research seems to have pinpointed the eight genes which are responsible for the disease.</p> <p><strong> 20 Black Americans are more likely to get prostate cancer than whites</strong></p> <p> True. No one knows why. </p> <p><strong> 21 There's this Chinese herb stuff which really zaps prostate cancer</strong></p> <p>Absolutely. Western researchers call it PC-SPES. It's an over-the-counter powder supplement with eight different plants in it: isatis, liquorice, lucid ganoderma, pseudo-ginseng, rubescens, saw palmetto and scute. Research is at an early stage, but when rats on PC-SPES were injected with cancer cells, only 60% of them got tumours - compared to the usual 99. Lab tests by Dr Jan Geliebter of New York Medical College further showed that PC-SPES \"strongly inhibits\" the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture.</p> <p><strong> 22 So vegetarians get less cancer</strong></p> <p>No. Eating five portions of fruit and veg a day - whether you're a carnivore, a vegetarian or a vegan - is the thing that could keep Mr C away, or at least make him less likely to come calling. For 20 years, experts have pointed out that red meat and saturated fats are laden with the bad stuff - the chemicals that kick off the process which leads to cancer - while the good stuff is in fruit and vegetables: phytochemicals and antioxidants which fight it. The conclusion propounded was that meat-eating was the problem. Not so. A recent piece of research by the ICRF found that vegetarians are just as likely to die of bowel cancer as meat eaters. Nor was there any difference in breast, prostate, lung or stomach cancer. \"Our analysis suggests that meat itself may have little effect on the development of the disease,\" says the ICRF's Dr Timothy Key - a fairly categorical statement by scientific standards. Another study, by the US National Cancer Institute, found that people on a low-fat, high-fibre diet seemed to stand as much chance of developing pre-cancerous growths in their colons as those who steaked up and burgered out. But it's hard to know what to read into that. Questions are definitely begged. What do pre-cancerous growths, for example, have to say about cancerous ones? And what about cancers outside the colon? Still, a recent AICR expert review of 247 studies found that 78% showed that vegetables and fruit protected against cancer. So best keep having salad with those chips.</p> <p><strong> 23 Garlic beats cancer</strong></p> <p>A recent study-review by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) suggests that those who regularly eat garlic - raw or cooked - run half the risk of stomach cancer and two-thirds the risk of colon cancer. The AICR recommends eating two to five cloves a week or taking garlic supplements, though the UNC-CH found no benefit in supplements. Why does garlic help? The suggestion is it's because it attacks helicobacter pylori which is closely linked to stomach cancer.</p> <p><strong> 24 Fruit juice stops you getting cancer </strong></p> <p>It probably helps. A glass of juice counts as one portion of the five a day of fruit and vegetables that the WHO and other experts say will lower your risk. For these purposes, by the way, potatoes and nuts don't count as vegetables.</p> <p><strong> 25 Vegans, then. They get less cancer</strong></p> <p>They certainly have lower levels of IGF-I - Insulin-like Growth Factor-I - which increases the risk of prostate cancer. \"Even small differences are predictive,\" says Dr Timothy Key. Low levels are found in places where little meat or dairy products are eaten. An ICRF study revealed that IGF-I levels are 9% lower in vegans than in meat eaters. However, says an epidemiologist, \"studies with big leaps of faith - the technical term is 'proxy outcomes' - from a chemical to a disease don't get me too excited\".</p>",

Staggeringly, a majority of US citizens, when polled by the Discovery Channel, said they thought air pollution carried as big a cancer risk as heavy smoking. That's pretty much on a level with thinking the moon's made of green cheese. Still, maybe it's no coincidence. Believing some nasty big business out there is to blame for cancer has two advantages - it stops being your responsibility and, perhaps more importantly in the lawyer-heavy US, it affords you the opportunity to sue the bejaysus out of them. 5 There is more and more and more of it around Well, yes, but this is mostly because more of us live longer. It's overwhelmingly a disease of age - nearly two-thirds of all cancers occur in the over-65s. Also, fewer of us are dying of other diseases - and, death being death, we've all got to die of something. Still, even the age-standardised rates have risen. From 1971 to 1997, levels rose 13% in men and 34% in women. More recently, though, there has been a significant decline in male cancer - down 5.75% since 1994. This is probably because of the long-term drop in lung cancer rates - down 33% from 1986 to 1997. Female cancers, though, have risen a little recently, but they're still below their 1992 peak. In the US, by the way, it's fallen even faster - 10% down overall since the 1992 peak. 6 Every second person seems to have it Almost. In the US, 48% of men and 37% of women will get cancer at some point during their life. The UK figure is a little lower. According to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF), just over one in three will get it, one in four will die of it. Currently, the male five-year survival rate is just 31%, while the female is 43%. Five years is the cancer experts' preferred definition of \"survival\". 7 There was some blood in my stools for a bit, but then it stopped, so I haven't got cancer Maybe, maybe not. Cancerous polyps do bleed intermittently. 8 Cervical cancer is a promiscuity thing Afraid so. The younger a woman is when she first has sex and the more sexual partners she has in her lifetime, the greater her chance of getting cervical cancer. That's because it's one of the few cancers caused by something you can catch. More than 99% of women who get it have the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Male promiscuity is also a major cause - women who've only had one partner also get HPV. Male promiscuity, combined with lower hygiene levels, is often the problem in the Third World - men catch HPV from prostitutes and infect their wives and lovers. Colombia, for example, has the world's highest rate. There is an HPV test, but trials have had varying results. In some, it's proved accurate. In others, it has produced a number of both false-positives and false-negatives - though the trials weren't large enough to establish whether the numbers were unacceptably large. As recently as September 1999, Dr Peter Sasieni of the ICRF said that adding it routinely \"would certainly lead to greatly increased costs without necessarily significantly decreasing the amount of cancers\". However, both he and the ICRF now believe \"that HPV testing holds great promise as a primary screening method. It has an abnormality detection rate of about 90%, compared with 75 or less for a smear test.\" Currently, it's being tested on borderline cases - still 250,000 a year. Cervical screening is already working. It cut cases by 42% between 1988 and 1997, and deaths have fallen by 50% in the last 15 years. 9 Male circumcision prevents cervical cancer There is some evidence for this. In India, Muslim women have a lower rate of cervical cancer than Hindus and Christians. It certainly seems to prevent penile cancer, which is virtually never seen in circumcised men. 10 I've got genital warts: that means cervical cancer somewhere down the line, right? Almost certainly not. When it comes to cervical cancer, if you can see the problem with the naked eye, it means you haven't got a problem. Nasty but true. More than 60 variants of HPV have been identified. Genital warts are produced by HPV Types 6 and 11, which have no link with cervical cancer. The danger ones are HPV 16, 18, 33, 35 and 45. The big problem is they're mostly \"silent\". Many of us have these HPVs, very few of us know it - a big deal when your chances with cervical cancer are directly related to the disease's progress by the time of diagnosis. Have a pap smear, basically. Because, in the words of the American National Cancer Institute, \"properly treated, tumour control of cervical cancer should be nearly 100%\". 11 Extremely overweight people are more likely to develop it Some American sources say there is a connection between obesity and cancer. The ICRF says the link is not clear. There are two exceptions, though. Obese women are three to five times more likely to get endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer and obese post-menopausal women run an increased risk of breast cancer. 12 More men die of testicular cancer than women do of breast cancer Not so. Testicular cancer is a very rare disease. It accounts for just one per cent of male cancers - in England and Wales in 1999, 71 died of it, compared with the 11,548 women who died of breast cancer. Incidence has doubled over the last 20 years - though it may now be on the decline since a 1996 peak. It is one of the few cancers that attacks the young. Nine out of 10 cases are in under-55s - and non-descended testicles by the age of seven is a strong indicator for it. The survival rate is excellent, however - almost 95%. 13 OK then, more men die of prostate cancer than women of breast cancer Wrong again, though the figures are a little closer. Breast cancer is the leading killer disease for women between 35 and 54. According to the Office for National Statistics, the lifetime risk is one in nine. Prostate cancer, by contrast, is a one in 14 shot - still 10,000 deaths a year, with a 41% survival rate. Breast cancer survival rates are rapidly improving, though. It kills some 13,000 British women a year, of the 35,000 who develop it. But that is far better than it was. Since the late 80s, when we had one of the lowest survival rates in Europe, deaths have fallen by 30%, faster than anywhere else in the world. That was from a very high starting point, though, so more women are still dying in Britain than in America, Australia and some of Europe. 14 Breast cancer is killing more and more young women Definitely not. Death rates have been reduced by 30% in young and middle-aged victims - mostly because of the efficacy of tamoxifen, a cheap and effective drug which blocks hormone receptors on cancer cells, interfering with their growth. It probably saves more lives than any other form of non-surgical cancer treatment. In younger women, chemotherapy after surgery has made a big difference to death rates. 15 Left-handers are more likely to get breast cancer, so are virgins Yes and yes. The left-hand difference - which is \"modest\" - was reported in the journal Epidemiology. A suggestion is that there is a link to the hypothesis that intrauterine exposure to steroid hormones may play a role in the development of breast cancer, as well as influencing handedness. Virgins are more likely to get it because they don't have children. Breast cancer is closely linked to oestrogen levels. Asian women in Asia, for example, have low levels of both - and British women high ones. Having babies, particularly when you're young, lowers the risk. By contrast, the fewer children you have, the greater your risk. Other risks are late menopause and having a first child after 30 - the older you are, the greater the danger. According to Dr Hilakivi-Clarke of the AICR, it now seems that the impact of high oestrogen levels varies through a woman's life. In the reproductive years, they have no effect at all. In the womb and after menopause, they increase the risk. During childhood, they now appear to play a \"powerful protective role\". 16 Routine mammograms are a waste of time for over-65s No, says the US. Yes, said the ICRF till just the other week - \"There is no good medical reason to justify the decision.\" No, it now says. In the last week of September, the government announced that routine screening would be extended to 65- to 70-year-olds by 2004. 17 I've got a painful lump in my breast, so I must have cancer Most likely not - 90% of breast cancer tumours are not painful, according to a clinician. It is far more likely to be an abscess, which is then always painful. 18 Every man, if he lived long enough, would eventually get prostate cancer Probably. The death toll has doubled over the last 20 years, and in 20 years' time, 50,000 men a year will get it. According to Dr Peter Sasieni, statistician for the ICRF, 40% of all 80-year-old men have it - this was established through post-mortems. Many won't know they've got it, as it develops slowly and they'll die of something else first. \"You can assume that the incidence increases with age. So if men lived to over 120 or so, it is possible they would all get prostate cancer.\" But not necessarily die of it. It looks as if there could well be a form of prostate cancer that just sits there and grows very slowly. 19 The PSA test has transformed the survival rate for prostate cancer The jury's out on this. In the US, prostate cancer deaths have dropped 10% since the early 90s - both experts and patient groups attribute this to the prostate-specific antigen test (PSA) which is a simple blood test. Experts here are nowhere near as convinced, pointing out the test's low accuracy level - it produces an unacceptable number of both false-positives and false-negatives. One of the big problems is figuring out whether a tumour is aggressive or not. New research seems to have pinpointed the eight genes which are responsible for the disease. 20 Black Americans are more likely to get prostate cancer than whites True. No one knows why. 21 There's this Chinese herb stuff which really zaps prostate cancer Absolutely. Western researchers call it PC-SPES. It's an over-the-counter powder supplement with eight different plants in it: isatis, liquorice, lucid ganoderma, pseudo-ginseng, rubescens, saw palmetto and scute. Research is at an early stage, but when rats on PC-SPES were injected with cancer cells, only 60% of them got tumours - compared to the usual 99. Lab tests by Dr Jan Geliebter of New York Medical College further showed that PC-SPES \"strongly inhibits\" the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture. 22 So vegetarians get less cancer No. Eating five portions of fruit and veg a day - whether you're a carnivore, a vegetarian or a vegan - is the thing that could keep Mr C away, or at least make him less likely to come calling. For 20 years, experts have pointed out that red meat and saturated fats are laden with the bad stuff - the chemicals that kick off the process which leads to cancer - while the good stuff is in fruit and vegetables: phytochemicals and antioxidants which fight it. The conclusion propounded was that meat-eating was the problem. Not so. A recent piece of research by the ICRF found that vegetarians are just as likely to die of bowel cancer as meat eaters. Nor was there any difference in breast, prostate, lung or stomach cancer. \"Our analysis suggests that meat itself may have little effect on the development of the disease,\" says the ICRF's Dr Timothy Key - a fairly categorical statement by scientific standards. Another study, by the US National Cancer Institute, found that people on a low-fat, high-fibre diet seemed to stand as much chance of developing pre-cancerous growths in their colons as those who steaked up and burgered out. But it's hard to know what to read into that. Questions are definitely begged. What do pre-cancerous growths, for example, have to say about cancerous ones? And what about cancers outside the colon? Still, a recent AICR expert review of 247 studies found that 78% showed that vegetables and fruit protected against cancer. So best keep having salad with those chips. 23 Garlic beats cancer A recent study-review by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) suggests that those who regularly eat garlic - raw or cooked - run half the risk of stomach cancer and two-thirds the risk of colon cancer. The AICR recommends eating two to five cloves a week or taking garlic supplements, though the UNC-CH found no benefit in supplements. Why does garlic help? The suggestion is it's because it attacks helicobacter pylori which is closely linked to stomach cancer. 24 Fruit juice stops you getting cancer It probably helps. A glass of juice counts as one portion of the five a day of fruit and vegetables that the WHO and other experts say will lower your risk. For these purposes, by the way, potatoes and nuts don't count as vegetables. 25 Vegans, then. They get less cancer They certainly have lower levels of IGF-I - Insulin-like Growth Factor-I - which increases the risk of prostate cancer. \"Even small differences are predictive,\" says Dr Timothy Key. Low levels are found in places where little meat or dairy products are eaten. An ICRF study revealed that IGF-I levels are 9% lower in vegans than in meat eaters. However, says an epidemiologist, \"studies with big leaps of faith - the technical term is 'proxy outcomes' - from a chemical to a disease don't get me too excited\".",

      "body": "<p><strong> 26 It's like blue eyes or black hair - something you get from your parents</strong></p> <p>Sometimes, yes, but mostly, no. The best evidence comes from a giant twin study - 44,000 pairs of them. Done by the AICR and published in July, it found that even identical twins have only a 10% chance of developing the same cancer. The study estimated that \"60 to 70% of all cancers can be avoided by making small, ongoing changes in what we eat and how we live\". Smoking was said to be the number one cause - 35%. In second place was diet, with 30. The accepted genetic element across all cancers is no more than 10%. Within that figure, though, are three cancers with a strong heritable (the word scientists prefer to genetic) component. The twin study gave prostate at 42%, colorectal at 35, and breast at 27. Although there seems to be general agreement about prostate cancer, other researchers disagree on the heritable level of both colorectal and breast. A common figure given for colorectal is 10, but Colon Cancer Concern gives just 6%. And, according to Professor Alan Ashworth of the Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre, London, only 5 to 10% of breast cancers are familial. These are caused by mutation in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. If a woman has either of those, \"it is 85% likely she will develop breast cancer by the age of 70\". </p> <p>What you really want to know, of course, is whether you'll get it. If your parents had cancer, the thing to look out for is if they got it before they were 55 - after that, you're just dealing with the ravages of life. If either parent got colon cancer before they were 55, for example, your odds of getting it are twice what they would have been if your parents had waited until after their 55th birthday - though your odds are still markedly worse than for someone whose parents didn't get it. Even if your family does have a cancer gene, it doesn't mean you're certain to get it. Like blue eyes or colour blindness, it follows the laws of Mendelian genetics What is genetic is your response to drugs. Soon, a simple DNA test - via a finger prick or mouthwash - may make it possible to match the patient to the drug which will be most effective and least unpleasant.</p> <p><strong> 27 Most heavy smokers will die of lung cancer</strong></p> <p>No. According to US figures, a surprising 85 to 90% of the top risk 20/20s (20 or more gaspers a day for 20 or more years) will not get lung cancer, though they'll probably die younger anyway of a stroke or a heart attack. But the fact is that even the link between smoking and lung cancer is not 100%: something else must be going on - probably a combination of genetics and diet. But - and it's an enormous but - lung cancer has a terrifyingly low survival rate, just 5%. It is the third commonest form of death in the UK. Also, according to the CRC, one-third of all cancers are linked to smoking and it's a major factor in at least 12 different ones. The ICRF adds that 90% of all lung cancers are caused by smoking and that 50% of all persistent cigarette smokers will eventually be killed by their habit. Which also means, of course, that 50% won't. Evens ain't great odds, though, is it?</p> <p><strong> 28 Antioxidant supplements accelerate lung cancer in smokers</strong></p> <p>The experts are deeply divided on this. Yes, say a pair of trials conducted by the CRC, which showed betacarotene increasing the risk. Yes, says the AICR. No, says Professor Sir Richard Peto. He points to a third trial conducted over a much longer period which showed no such association. A big study run by a Boston hospital, it involved 22,000 American doctors - half took 50mg doses of betacarotene, half took a placebo. Its conclusion: \"Twelve years of supplementation with betacarotene produced neither benefit nor harm in terms of death from all causes.\"</p> <p><strong> 29 People who smoke only one or two cigarettes a day have nothing to worry about</strong></p> <p>No, but the risk is what scientists call \"linear\". Smoking 20 a day gives you an overall 50% chance of dying from the effect - not just cancers but heart and lung disease, too. Smoking two a day brings that risk down to 5% - still the most dangerous thing smokers do in their lives. Scientists are also sceptical about people's ability to stick to two a day. According to ICRF, smokers who stop in middle age avoid most of their later risk of being killed by tobacco, and those who stop before middle age avoid nearly all the risk. People giving up is the main reason lung cancer is dropping faster here than anywhere else in the world. Are cigars safer? Yes, but only if you don't inhale. Also, you run a higher risk of mouth and throat cancer. Is passive smoking really that dangerous? Officially, yes. The estimate is that it kills 300 a year in the UK - the cancer risk is probably 2% of the active smoking risk. Some researchers are still not convinced, though, about the seriousness of the risk. Dr Ken Denson of the Thame Thrombois and Haemostosis Research Foundation says 10 cigarettes a day is fine, that passive smoking is not a problem but that smokers get lung cancer because of their poor diet. Others say that the Thame Thrombois and Haemostosis Research Foundation is a tobacco industry apologist.</p> <p><strong> 30 I've got a cough, therefore I haven't got lung cancer</strong></p> <p>Er, no. A cough occurs in 80% of lung cancers. </p> <p><strong> 31 Not all lung cancer is caused by smoking</strong></p> <p>True. According to the ICRF, one in 20 UK cases is caused by radon, the natural gas which leaks up from the earth, particularly in the West Country, and accumulates in houses. However, says an epidemiologist, these \"findings are just at the border or what can be detected in epidemiologic studies. It's actually a pretty small number of lung cancers, particularly in non-smokers.\"</p> <p><strong> 32 Infertility treatment increases your risk of ovarian cancer</strong></p> <p>Sadly, probably so. Basically, it seems that the more eggs a woman produces, the higher her risk. So pregnancy and the pill both reduce that risk, while women who start menstruating early and finish late face an increased chance of getting it. It's as if, over millions of years, women developed reproductive systems that were balanced around their reality of their lives - late puberty because of bad diet, followed by lots of pregnancies (if not always live children) and then an early death. Modern life not being like that, the system is out of whack - and prone to cancer.</p> <p><strong> 33 You're more likely to die of it here than in Europe or the US</strong></p> <p>True - probably. Cancer researchers are wary of making direct comparisons, but there does seem to be a clear difference. The best comparison is what statisticians call \"age-standardised death rates per million\" - that means there is no bias against countries with an ageing population. According to the ONS, for England and Wales, a male figure of 2,674 is slightly worse than Europe's 2,432. When it comes to women, though, the difference is startling - 2,464 to 1,672. It's also widely accepted that our overall survival rate is 40%, compared with some of Europe's 50%. In the US, 60% of patients now survive at least five years. For colorectal cancer, the UK survival rate is around 40%, compared with Europe's 45 and 60 in the US.</p> <p><strong> 34 Loads of children get it and they invariably die</strong></p> <p>Not at all. Cancer is overwhelmingly a disease of age. Look at the very latest figures, in the autumn 2000 edition of Health Statistics Quarterly. The peak for both men and women comes at 70 to 74 years of age. Just 5% of male cancers and 9% of female cancers occur in under-45s. And children? Under-15s account for just 0.6% of all cancers - though that's still 1,200 to 1,300 cases a year. A third of those are leukaemia (which is not particularly heritable, by the way) but even there the outlook is neither as it was nor as bleak as people think. Improved chemo routines and refinement of bone-marrow transplants have cut childhood leukaemia deaths by 57% in the US and 50% here. The UK recovery rate for childhood cancers is 60% overall, 90% for some. That's why there are 18,000 survivors out there. On the other hand, it's still the most common cause of death from illness in children.</p> <p><strong> 35 Only humans get it</strong></p> <p>Not true. Domestic and farm animals and birds and fish all get it. Wild animals? Mostly, no. They don't live long enough to get it - because they don't have the antibiotics and medical care we give to our pets and prospective dinners. Recent US research, though, suggests those other top-of-the-food-chainers, sharks, do get it.</p> <p><strong> 36 You can get it from the barbie</strong></p> <p>Maybe, but unlikely. The blackened crust on a piece of BBQed meat or fish contains heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), which are certainly carcinogenic. The same applies to grilling and frying in very hot oil. In fact, no one has actually been able to implicate barbecuing in cancers. Also, according to the ICRF, lab tests that showed the DNA damage, which is central to the cancer process, used much higher doses of the chemicals than humans consume - though it still recommends not eating large quantities of charred food. The AICR also issues an annual warning at the start of the summer grilling season. It recommends avoiding charred food and eating grilled meat and fish only occasionally. If you must, it advises using lean meat (bye bye ribs, so long bangers), cutting the fat and skin off, removing any charred sections and using tongs - puncturing the surface allows fat to drip down and cause flame-ups, which produce another kind of carcinogen, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However - and it's a big, happy however - you can cut the risk by marinating the meat or fish. Lab tests produced a 99% reduction in HCA and even brief baths in the marinade \"produced significant reductions\". Why? Scientists guess it's because typical marinade ingredients - vinegar, citrus juice, herbs, spices, olive oil - are famously full of the anti-cancer good stuff. Would that then mean that barbied fruit and veg aren't a problem? It would. They pose no known health risk, according to AICR director of nutrition education, Melanie Polk. \"And if you're looking for an exciting but healthy summertime dessert, try grilled fruit. The grill's heat caramelises the fruit's sugar and lends a more intense and deliciously sweet flavour.\"</p> <p><strong> 37 Scotland is the cancer capital of the world</strong></p> <p>There's some truth in that. Scottish cancer rates have been steadily increasing for years, particularly among poor men. The guess is that they are slower in seeing a doctor - and early diagnosis is closely linked to survival. The Scottish Cancer Intelligence Unit made international comparisons, with the US and a range of European countries, including England and Wales (still a unit, as far as statisticians are concerned). It reported: \"In both sexes, incidence and mortality rates were among the highest, whereas survival was the lowest.\" Though perhaps no worse than England and Wales, according to the report.</p> <p><strong> 38 High-earning whites are more likely to get testicular cancer than black men</strong></p> <p>Odd but true, according to the CRC.</p> <p><strong> 39 Cancer is caused by stress</strong></p> <p>Doesn't seem so. There is, however, some evidence that stress may trigger relapses. A late-80s study by Professor Amanda Ramirez of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Psychosocial Oncology Group compared female breast cancer victims who'd had a relapse with those who hadn't. Those who got it again were significantly more likely to have suffered traumatic life events - divorce, bereavement, bankruptcy, etc. Professor Ramirez thinks any potential link here is hormonal - oestrogen levels in the case of breast cancer. </p> <p><strong> 40 Too many kippers will give you stomach cancer</strong></p> <p>Yes and no. While it's true that there is an established link between stomach cancer and a diet heavy in smoked and/or pickled foods, you have to eat them in quite un-British quantities. \"The cause of the association is not clear, however,\" said David Forman, professor of cancer epidemiology at the University of Leeds and honorary consultant to the ICRF. \"Preserved foods of this kind are often consumed as part of a poor diet, deficient in fresh fruit and veg. So it is unclear whether it is something in the smoked/pickled foods themselves or the lack of fresh food - or both - which increases the risk.\" The classic example is Japan, where even now they don't eat much fruit and veg. Stomach cancer is closely linked to the bacterium Helicobacter pylori - according to an international study led by Dr David Forman, those infected are six times more likely to develop it.</p> <p><strong> 41 The sun gives you skin cancer</strong></p> <p>Ish. The fairness of your skin is the crucial factor. The paler it is, the greater the risk. The highest incidence of melanomas is in Queensland, Australia, the lowest is in Bombay - not exactly a sun-free spot. </p> <p><strong> 42 Selenium protects against cancer, and therefore I should take it as a supplement</strong></p> <p>Respectively, yes and no. Selenium does seem to help with lung, colon, oesophagal and prostate cancers - heart disease, too. \"It's a potent antioxidant which can block cell DNA damage,\" says Dr Peter E Newburger of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. It helps the enzymes which break down the free radicals that damage cells. But you almost certainly already get enough selenium in your diet - 55 micrograms a day for women, 70 for men. Too much can have serious side effects, from nausea up to cirrhosis of the liver. \"It's toxic when taken at high levels,\" says Dr Newburger. \"This is not a case of: if a little is good, a lot is better.\"</p> <p><strong> 43 Children who live near nuclear power plants get more cancer</strong></p> <p>Probably not. Despite extensive and continuing investigations of links between childhood cancers and nuclear installations, no clear clear risk difference has yet been established. Childhood leukaemia is caused by a mix of genetics and environment, it seems. A child is born with leukaemic cells but doesn't develop the disease until three or four years later. What happens? Well, childhood leukaemia seems to be linked with affluence, though that influence levels off. It is still rising here, but has levelled off in Sweden, which is more affluent. Also, clusters occur in large new residential areas. New people bring in new bugs, which trigger the abnormal reaction which kicks off the leukaemia.</p> <p><strong> 44 Untreated, all cancers will eventually kill</strong></p> <p>No. Occasionally, tumours disappear by themselves.</p> <p><strong> 45 Survival rates vary across the regions according to wealth</strong></p> <p>Yes, for nearly all cancers.</p> <p><strong> 46 Aspirin stops you getting cancer</strong></p> <p>It certainly seems to do something. The CRC is running tests to see if it prevents further polyps in people who have had cancerous colorectal polyps removed. It has also been linked with hindering prostate cancer.</p> <p><strong> 47 Expensive anti-cancer drugs are the major part of NHS care costs</strong></p> <p>No. The drugs bill is probably around 6% of the total care cost. Most of the money goes on looking after hospitalised patients. Also, though some drugs are very expensive, not all are. Tamoxifen, for example, is out of patent and therefore cheap, just \u00a310 a month. </p> <p><strong> 48 I've survived one year, therefore I'll be OK</strong></p> <p>It depends on the cancer. Your prospects are modest after a year. They are \"reasonably favourable\" after five years, though, for most cancers. Particularly so, according to Trends in Cancer Survival in Scotland, 1971-1995, if you're young and not poor. </p> <p><strong> 49 Scientists still don't know what cancer is and how it works</strong></p> <p>Wrong. As Dr John Potter said in his keynote address at the AICR annual conference in September: \"In the last decade particularly, our knowledge of the cancer process itself has significantly deepened.\" They now have a thorough understanding of what goes inside a cancer cell. Multiple faults in the cell's DNA - at least more than three - are required to turn a normal healthy cell into a cancerous, \"immortal\" one. What kicks this process off? Probably things such as radiation and stuff in the food we eat, but the key thing is the general ageing process. Anything particular scientists are paying close attention to? The tumour-suppressor P-53 is thought to be a prime suspect in 50% of cases. Cancer kills because it metastasises - spreads. The \"immortal\" cells break off from their original base and migrate through the body, setting up new colonies. Sometimes they base themselves on other organs and stop them working. Other times, the simple alienness of their presence just throws the body's system for a loop, smashing into the immune and endocrine systems, knocking their settings to hell. Too much or too little of the body's regulatory chemicals are released. Patients stop being able to absorb nutrients. So that means scientists have a full understanding of human cancer? Er, no. 2In the laboratory,\" added Dr Potter, \"the cancer process from healthy cell to cancerous tumour is relatively well worked out. In the human body, however, it is much less clear.\"</p> <p><strong> 50 There's a cure round the corner</strong></p> <p>Probably not. Cancer is more than 200 cancers - so a single cure is very unlikely. To mix up the clich\u00e9s, there have been a lot of false dawns and great white hopes. Anti-angiogenesis medications, for example, were big in 1998. Now some say that initial promise has not been fulfilled, though the ICRF disagrees, saying it is \"an exciting area of research\". There are hopes, though. Researchers at Imperial College and the Royal Free Hospital have found stem cells in the bone marrow that can turn into liver cells. The idea would be that a damaged liver could be reconstructed out of new, healthy, cancer-free stem cells. Dr Malcolm Alison of Imperial College said: \"Adult stem cells offer great promise... as they may generate the full spectrum of cell types needed to repair a damaged organ.\" Geron Corporation and Duke University have recently come up with the enticing notion of a universal (and patentable) vaccine for cancer, based on the enzyme telomerase, which is found at high levels in tumour cells. Unfortunately for Geron and Duke, it's also found at similar levels elsewhere in the body - bone marrow stem cells, for example. Using it to zap sick cells might also wipe out healthy cells. Another possible advance is making targeted vaccine from the RNA of tumour cells. \"This is quite neat,\" said Professor Nick Lemoine of the ICRF, but it's very much a top-dollar option - each patient will have to have a tailor-made vaccine. \"Many oncologists now believe we are entering a golden age of drug discovery,\" said the ICRF, pointing to the potential spin-offs from the human genome project. \"I am more sceptical,\" said an epidemiologist. \"All genetically engineered drugs are ridiculously expensive, as the biotech companies pay off their investors who took a beating for so many start-up years.\"</p> <p>And finally: what do cancer experts have for lunch? On 1 September, at the Renaissance Mayflower Hotel, Washington DC, many of the world's leading experts were gathered for the Tenth Annual Research Conference of the AICR, which focused on the role of nutrition in preventing and treating breast and prostate cancer. Dr Ritva Butrum, an AICR VP, organised the catering for lunch. Chef Norman Wade actually did the cooking. This is what they gave the experts: Grilled tuna ni\u00e7oise; Israeli couscous salad with asparagus and tomato; cucumber salad with onions and tomatoes; wild and brown rice salad; fresh fruit tartlets with low-fat pastry cream. </p> <p>Tuna is high in omega-3 fatty acids - it may fight breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers. The vegetables in the couscous salad are heavy on \"cancer-protective phytochemicals\": asparagus has saponins and tomatoes have lycopene - which are linked to reduced prostate cancer risk. Cherries have quercetin, \"an even more potent antioxidant than vitamin E\", which actually blocks carcinogens. Strawberries contain both ellagic and ferulic acids. Grapes have flavonoids. \"We successfully combined science savvy with gourmet quality,\" said Dr Butrum.</p> <p>\u0095 Sources: information and answers provided by Imperial Cancer Research Fund; American Institute of Cancer Research; National Institute of Health (US); Cancer Research Campaign; Colon Cancer Concern; Bacup; Breast Cancer Awareness; Scottish Cancer Intelligence Unit; National Cancer Institute (US); General Clinical Research Center (US); BMJ; New England Journal of Medicine; American Journal of Clinical Nutrition; Office for National Statistics, Information and Statistics Division, Scotland; Northern Ireland Cancer Registry; Dr Paul Brass; Dr Nigel Paneth</p>",

      "bodyText": "26 It's like blue eyes or black hair - something you get from your parents Sometimes, yes, but mostly, no. The best evidence comes from a giant twin study - 44,000 pairs of them. Done by the AICR and published in July, it found that even identical twins have only a 10% chance of developing the same cancer. The study estimated that \"60 to 70% of all cancers can be avoided by making small, ongoing changes in what we eat and how we live\". Smoking was said to be the number one cause - 35%. In second place was diet, with 30. The accepted genetic element across all cancers is no more than 10%. Within that figure, though, are three cancers with a strong heritable (the word scientists prefer to genetic) component. The twin study gave prostate at 42%, colorectal at 35, and breast at 27. Although there seems to be general agreement about prostate cancer, other researchers disagree on the heritable level of both colorectal and breast. A common figure given for colorectal is 10, but Colon Cancer Concern gives just 6%. And, according to Professor Alan Ashworth of the Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre, London, only 5 to 10% of breast cancers are familial. These are caused by mutation in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. If a woman has either of those, \"it is 85% likely she will develop breast cancer by the age of 70\". What you really want to know, of course, is whether you'll get it. If your parents had cancer, the thing to look out for is if they got it before they were 55 - after that, you're just dealing with the ravages of life. If either parent got colon cancer before they were 55, for example, your odds of getting it are twice what they would have been if your parents had waited until after their 55th birthday - though your odds are still markedly worse than for someone whose parents didn't get it. Even if your family does have a cancer gene, it doesn't mean you're certain to get it. Like blue eyes or colour blindness, it follows the laws of Mendelian genetics What is genetic is your response to drugs. Soon, a simple DNA test - via a finger prick or mouthwash - may make it possible to match the patient to the drug which will be most effective and least unpleasant. 27 Most heavy smokers will die of lung cancer No. According to US figures, a surprising 85 to 90% of the top risk 20/20s (20 or more gaspers a day for 20 or more years) will not get lung cancer, though they'll probably die younger anyway of a stroke or a heart attack. But the fact is that even the link between smoking and lung cancer is not 100%: something else must be going on - probably a combination of genetics and diet. But - and it's an enormous but - lung cancer has a terrifyingly low survival rate, just 5%. It is the third commonest form of death in the UK. Also, according to the CRC, one-third of all cancers are linked to smoking and it's a major factor in at least 12 different ones. The ICRF adds that 90% of all lung cancers are caused by smoking and that 50% of all persistent cigarette smokers will eventually be killed by their habit. Which also means, of course, that 50% won't. Evens ain't great odds, though, is it? 28 Antioxidant supplements accelerate lung cancer in smokers The experts are deeply divided on this. Yes, say a pair of trials conducted by the CRC, which showed betacarotene increasing the risk. Yes, says the AICR. No, says Professor Sir Richard Peto. He points to a third trial conducted over a much longer period which showed no such association. A big study run by a Boston hospital, it involved 22,000 American doctors - half took 50mg doses of betacarotene, half took a placebo. Its conclusion: \"Twelve years of supplementation with betacarotene produced neither benefit nor harm in terms of death from all causes.\" 29 People who smoke only one or two cigarettes a day have nothing to worry about No, but the risk is what scientists call \"linear\". Smoking 20 a day gives you an overall 50% chance of dying from the effect - not just cancers but heart and lung disease, too. Smoking two a day brings that risk down to 5% - still the most dangerous thing smokers do in their lives. Scientists are also sceptical about people's ability to stick to two a day. According to ICRF, smokers who stop in middle age avoid most of their later risk of being killed by tobacco, and those who stop before middle age avoid nearly all the risk. People giving up is the main reason lung cancer is dropping faster here than anywhere else in the world. Are cigars safer? Yes, but only if you don't inhale. Also, you run a higher risk of mouth and throat cancer. Is passive smoking really that dangerous? Officially, yes. The estimate is that it kills 300 a year in the UK - the cancer risk is probably 2% of the active smoking risk. Some researchers are still not convinced, though, about the seriousness of the risk. Dr Ken Denson of the Thame Thrombois and Haemostosis Research Foundation says 10 cigarettes a day is fine, that passive smoking is not a problem but that smokers get lung cancer because of their poor diet. Others say that the Thame Thrombois and Haemostosis Research Foundation is a tobacco industry apologist. 30 I've got a cough, therefore I haven't got lung cancer Er, no. A cough occurs in 80% of lung cancers. 31 Not all lung cancer is caused by smoking True. According to the ICRF, one in 20 UK cases is caused by radon, the natural gas which leaks up from the earth, particularly in the West Country, and accumulates in houses. However, says an epidemiologist, these \"findings are just at the border or what can be detected in epidemiologic studies. It's actually a pretty small number of lung cancers, particularly in non-smokers.\" 32 Infertility treatment increases your risk of ovarian cancer Sadly, probably so. Basically, it seems that the more eggs a woman produces, the higher her risk. So pregnancy and the pill both reduce that risk, while women who start menstruating early and finish late face an increased chance of getting it. It's as if, over millions of years, women developed reproductive systems that were balanced around their reality of their lives - late puberty because of bad diet, followed by lots of pregnancies (if not always live children) and then an early death. Modern life not being like that, the system is out of whack - and prone to cancer. 33 You're more likely to die of it here than in Europe or the US True - probably. Cancer researchers are wary of making direct comparisons, but there does seem to be a clear difference. The best comparison is what statisticians call \"age-standardised death rates per million\" - that means there is no bias against countries with an ageing population. According to the ONS, for England and Wales, a male figure of 2,674 is slightly worse than Europe's 2,432. When it comes to women, though, the difference is startling - 2,464 to 1,672. It's also widely accepted that our overall survival rate is 40%, compared with some of Europe's 50%. In the US, 60% of patients now survive at least five years. For colorectal cancer, the UK survival rate is around 40%, compared with Europe's 45 and 60 in the US. 34 Loads of children get it and they invariably die Not at all. Cancer is overwhelmingly a disease of age. Look at the very latest figures, in the autumn 2000 edition of Health Statistics Quarterly. The peak for both men and women comes at 70 to 74 years of age. Just 5% of male cancers and 9% of female cancers occur in under-45s. And children? Under-15s account for just 0.6% of all cancers - though that's still 1,200 to 1,300 cases a year. A third of those are leukaemia (which is not particularly heritable, by the way) but even there the outlook is neither as it was nor as bleak as people think. Improved chemo routines and refinement of bone-marrow transplants have cut childhood leukaemia deaths by 57% in the US and 50% here. The UK recovery rate for childhood cancers is 60% overall, 90% for some. That's why there are 18,000 survivors out there. On the other hand, it's still the most common cause of death from illness in children. 35 Only humans get it Not true. Domestic and farm animals and birds and fish all get it. Wild animals? Mostly, no. They don't live long enough to get it - because they don't have the antibiotics and medical care we give to our pets and prospective dinners. Recent US research, though, suggests those other top-of-the-food-chainers, sharks, do get it. 36 You can get it from the barbie Maybe, but unlikely. The blackened crust on a piece of BBQed meat or fish contains heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), which are certainly carcinogenic. The same applies to grilling and frying in very hot oil. In fact, no one has actually been able to implicate barbecuing in cancers. Also, according to the ICRF, lab tests that showed the DNA damage, which is central to the cancer process, used much higher doses of the chemicals than humans consume - though it still recommends not eating large quantities of charred food. The AICR also issues an annual warning at the start of the summer grilling season. It recommends avoiding charred food and eating grilled meat and fish only occasionally. If you must, it advises using lean meat (bye bye ribs, so long bangers), cutting the fat and skin off, removing any charred sections and using tongs - puncturing the surface allows fat to drip down and cause flame-ups, which produce another kind of carcinogen, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However - and it's a big, happy however - you can cut the risk by marinating the meat or fish. Lab tests produced a 99% reduction in HCA and even brief baths in the marinade \"produced significant reductions\". Why? Scientists guess it's because typical marinade ingredients - vinegar, citrus juice, herbs, spices, olive oil - are famously full of the anti-cancer good stuff. Would that then mean that barbied fruit and veg aren't a problem? It would. They pose no known health risk, according to AICR director of nutrition education, Melanie Polk. \"And if you're looking for an exciting but healthy summertime dessert, try grilled fruit. The grill's heat caramelises the fruit's sugar and lends a more intense and deliciously sweet flavour.\" 37 Scotland is the cancer capital of the world There's some truth in that. Scottish cancer rates have been steadily increasing for years, particularly among poor men. The guess is that they are slower in seeing a doctor - and early diagnosis is closely linked to survival. The Scottish Cancer Intelligence Unit made international comparisons, with the US and a range of European countries, including England and Wales (still a unit, as far as statisticians are concerned). It reported: \"In both sexes, incidence and mortality rates were among the highest, whereas survival was the lowest.\" Though perhaps no worse than England and Wales, according to the report. 38 High-earning whites are more likely to get testicular cancer than black men Odd but true, according to the CRC. 39 Cancer is caused by stress Doesn't seem so. There is, however, some evidence that stress may trigger relapses. A late-80s study by Professor Amanda Ramirez of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Psychosocial Oncology Group compared female breast cancer victims who'd had a relapse with those who hadn't. Those who got it again were significantly more likely to have suffered traumatic life events - divorce, bereavement, bankruptcy, etc. Professor Ramirez thinks any potential link here is hormonal - oestrogen levels in the case of breast cancer. 40 Too many kippers will give you stomach cancer Yes and no. While it's true that there is an established link between stomach cancer and a diet heavy in smoked and/or pickled foods, you have to eat them in quite un-British quantities. \"The cause of the association is not clear, however,\" said David Forman, professor of cancer epidemiology at the University of Leeds and honorary consultant to the ICRF. \"Preserved foods of this kind are often consumed as part of a poor diet, deficient in fresh fruit and veg. So it is unclear whether it is something in the smoked/pickled foods themselves or the lack of fresh food - or both - which increases the risk.\" The classic example is Japan, where even now they don't eat much fruit and veg. Stomach cancer is closely linked to the bacterium Helicobacter pylori - according to an international study led by Dr David Forman, those infected are six times more likely to develop it. 41 The sun gives you skin cancer Ish. The fairness of your skin is the crucial factor. The paler it is, the greater the risk. The highest incidence of melanomas is in Queensland, Australia, the lowest is in Bombay - not exactly a sun-free spot. 42 Selenium protects against cancer, and therefore I should take it as a supplement Respectively, yes and no. Selenium does seem to help with lung, colon, oesophagal and prostate cancers - heart disease, too. \"It's a potent antioxidant which can block cell DNA damage,\" says Dr Peter E Newburger of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. It helps the enzymes which break down the free radicals that damage cells. But you almost certainly already get enough selenium in your diet - 55 micrograms a day for women, 70 for men. Too much can have serious side effects, from nausea up to cirrhosis of the liver. \"It's toxic when taken at high levels,\" says Dr Newburger. \"This is not a case of: if a little is good, a lot is better.\" 43 Children who live near nuclear power plants get more cancer Probably not. Despite extensive and continuing investigations of links between childhood cancers and nuclear installations, no clear clear risk difference has yet been established. Childhood leukaemia is caused by a mix of genetics and environment, it seems. A child is born with leukaemic cells but doesn't develop the disease until three or four years later. What happens? Well, childhood leukaemia seems to be linked with affluence, though that influence levels off. It is still rising here, but has levelled off in Sweden, which is more affluent. Also, clusters occur in large new residential areas. New people bring in new bugs, which trigger the abnormal reaction which kicks off the leukaemia. 44 Untreated, all cancers will eventually kill No. Occasionally, tumours disappear by themselves. 45 Survival rates vary across the regions according to wealth Yes, for nearly all cancers. 46 Aspirin stops you getting cancer It certainly seems to do something. The CRC is running tests to see if it prevents further polyps in people who have had cancerous colorectal polyps removed. It has also been linked with hindering prostate cancer. 47 Expensive anti-cancer drugs are the major part of NHS care costs No. The drugs bill is probably around 6% of the total care cost. Most of the money goes on looking after hospitalised patients. Also, though some drugs are very expensive, not all are. Tamoxifen, for example, is out of patent and therefore cheap, just \u00a310 a month. 48 I've survived one year, therefore I'll be OK It depends on the cancer. Your prospects are modest after a year. They are \"reasonably favourable\" after five years, though, for most cancers. Particularly so, according to Trends in Cancer Survival in Scotland, 1971-1995, if you're young and not poor. 49 Scientists still don't know what cancer is and how it works Wrong. As Dr John Potter said in his keynote address at the AICR annual conference in September: \"In the last decade particularly, our knowledge of the cancer process itself has significantly deepened.\" They now have a thorough understanding of what goes inside a cancer cell. Multiple faults in the cell's DNA - at least more than three - are required to turn a normal healthy cell into a cancerous, \"immortal\" one. What kicks this process off? Probably things such as radiation and stuff in the food we eat, but the key thing is the general ageing process. Anything particular scientists are paying close attention to? The tumour-suppressor P-53 is thought to be a prime suspect in 50% of cases. Cancer kills because it metastasises - spreads. The \"immortal\" cells break off from their original base and migrate through the body, setting up new colonies. Sometimes they base themselves on other organs and stop them working. Other times, the simple alienness of their presence just throws the body's system for a loop, smashing into the immune and endocrine systems, knocking their settings to hell. Too much or too little of the body's regulatory chemicals are released. Patients stop being able to absorb nutrients. So that means scientists have a full understanding of human cancer? Er, no. 2In the laboratory,\" added Dr Potter, \"the cancer process from healthy cell to cancerous tumour is relatively well worked out. In the human body, however, it is much less clear.\" 50 There's a cure round the corner Probably not. Cancer is more than 200 cancers - so a single cure is very unlikely. To mix up the clich\u00e9s, there have been a lot of false dawns and great white hopes. Anti-angiogenesis medications, for example, were big in 1998. Now some say that initial promise has not been fulfilled, though the ICRF disagrees, saying it is \"an exciting area of research\". There are hopes, though.

If the BBC is going to behave like ITV, say the critics, it needs to be regulated in the same way. 'Senior government sources' are quoted as saying that the governors have signed their own death warrant. It's all nonsense, but the argument suits a lot of people (and a lot of self-interests).

They are in decline, for any number of reasons from the availability of more channels and news sources to more populist competition and less interest in the world around us. Where 10 or even five years ago, average audiences for the BBC 9pm bulletin would hover around 6.5 million, today it is lucky to achieve 6 million; it sometimes falls below 5 million. Of course, delaying the news by an hour, won't increase audiences, but it may halt the decline. More importantly, it opens up a three-hour slot for the BBC to schedule a mix of the popular, the risky and the serious. </p> <p>Perhaps the BBC hasn't helped its case by appearing to argue for a purely entertainment-based BBC1. Yet its consultation document on new services says explicitly that current services 'will continue substantially unchanged'. So, we're talking about a BBC that still has very different priorities from commercial channels, but is allowing itself the freedom to be ratings-conscious (as opposed to ratings-dominated) on its flagship channel in order to cement its role in licence-payers' lives. There must be - and will be - popular programmes on BBC1 that simply would never appear on a commercial channel between 7 and 10pm. Moving the news helps the BBC to fulfil that objective. </p> <p>Then there's the issue of ITV and its belated attempt to claw back the 10pm slot. Remember that the 20-minute Nightly News at 11 o'clock was never designed to be a later version of News at Ten. Its length, agenda and figurehead were brought forward to 6.30pm. Had ITV been prepared to install another serious half-hour bulletin, guaranteed every night, there would have been no case to answer. Unfortunately, an earlier version of the Nightly News three days a week is not a serious news proposition. </p> <p>Those who worry about the consequences of news bulletins going head-to-head need have no fears. The chances of ITV sticking to its plan - or being held to it by the Independent Television Commission - are remote given the certain pasting it will receive in direct competition with the BBC. ITV's news will stay at 11pm - and will probably fade from sight altogether as its public service requirement reduces to a single, substantial bulletin. </p> <p>Finally, there's the tricky question of the governors' death warrant. If you believe the hype, senior civil servants and Ministers have suddenly resolved to do away with the governors and hand power over the BBC to a single industry regulator. </p> <p>In truth, the commercial sector has been lobbying for formal BBC regulation for years and is increasingly frustrated at its commercial freedom being restricted by a well-funded competitor subject only to very general public service obligations. An umbrella regulator would be more sympathetic to the commercial cause. </p> <p>It would also be a most sinister development, giving enormous power to a single body of government-appointed overseers and making any attempt by the BBC to shore up its own popularity virtually impossible. For that reason it was probably not the most diplomatic of moves for the BBC chairman to dismiss the Secretary of State as merely a licence-fee payer. </p> <p>But the die was cast some time ago, and shifting the news may be one of the last significant decisions the BBC can make without reference to the interests of its commercial competitors. Ultimately, it is viewers who will lose out.</p>",

So, we're talking about a BBC that still has very different priorities from commercial channels, but is allowing itself the freedom to be ratings-conscious (as opposed to ratings-dominated) on its flagship channel in order to cement its role in licence-payers' lives. There must be - and will be - popular programmes on BBC1 that simply would never appear on a commercial channel between 7 and 10pm. Moving the news helps the BBC to fulfil that objective. Then there's the issue of ITV and its belated attempt to claw back the 10pm slot. Remember that the 20-minute Nightly News at 11 o'clock was never designed to be a later version of News at Ten. Its length, agenda and figurehead were brought forward to 6.30pm. Had ITV been prepared to install another serious half-hour bulletin, guaranteed every night, there would have been no case to answer. Unfortunately, an earlier version of the Nightly News three days a week is not a serious news proposition. Those who worry about the consequences of news bulletins going head-to-head need have no fears. The chances of ITV sticking to its plan - or being held to it by the Independent Television Commission - are remote given the certain pasting it will receive in direct competition with the BBC. ITV's news will stay at 11pm - and will probably fade from sight altogether as its public service requirement reduces to a single, substantial bulletin. Finally, there's the tricky question of the governors' death warrant. If you believe the hype, senior civil servants and Ministers have suddenly resolved to do away with the governors and hand power over the BBC to a single industry regulator. In truth, the commercial sector has been lobbying for formal BBC regulation for years and is increasingly frustrated at its commercial freedom being restricted by a well-funded competitor subject only to very general public service obligations. An umbrella regulator would be more sympathetic to the commercial cause. It would also be a most sinister development, giving enormous power to a single body of government-appointed overseers and making any attempt by the BBC to shore up its own popularity virtually impossible. For that reason it was probably not the most diplomatic of moves for the BBC chairman to dismiss the Secretary of State as merely a licence-fee payer. But the die was cast some time ago, and shifting the news may be one of the last significant decisions the BBC can make without reference to the interests of its commercial competitors. Ultimately, it is viewers who will lose out.",

Only last week-end all must have seemed well. Home Office Ministers Jack Straw and Mike O'Brien were welcoming his report as timely, and he must have felt that his fair-minded document had pulled off the difficult balancing act between recognising how far Britain had advanced in constructing a multi-ethnic society, and how deeply embedded racial attitudes remained. But in a 400-page book on page 38, paragraph 3.30 - and unnoticed by the civil servants who had written pro-briefing papers for Straw and O'Brien - he had dared to write: </p> <p>'However there is one major and so far insuperable barrier. Britishness, as much as Englishness, has systematic, largely unspoken racial connotations. Whiteness nowhere features as an explicit condition of being British, but it is widely understood that Englishness, and therefore by extension Britishness, is racially coded. \"There ain't no black in the Union Jack,\" it has been said...Unless these deep-rooted antagonisms to racial and cultural differences can be defeated in practice, as well as symbolically written out of the national story, the idea of a multicultural post-nation remains an empty promise.' </p> <p>Lord Parekh was silly, and his last sentence - although he does not recognise it - contains an implicit reverse racial connotation; namely that the host nation's values are no more than equal to those of some incoming cultures, whose attachment to some values like arranged marriages and gross sexism correctly (in my view) raises objections from the 'British'. For that his Commission warranted a sharp rebuke. </p> <p>But - and this is fundamental - he did not write that to be British was to be 'racist' (as claimed in the Daily Telegraph ) or was a tag for 'coded racism'. There is a world of difference between Britishness having 'largely unspoken racial connotations' and 'a wide understanding... that Britishness is racially coded', which sadly is probably true, and an accusation of racism. Parekh, like Hoddle and Keegan, was in part an author of his own misfortunes, but by pushing the story beyond what the report actually said, latching on to the British-as-racist angle and then massively over-projecting it, the media succeeded in creating an overheated atmosphere that the report only partially justified. Instead of opening up a vital discussion, it was closed down with most people - and I include myself - rallying to the Sun 's 12 reasons to be proud of being British. </p> <p>Accuracy is becoming the slave of the need to create news events that are sufficiently arresting to shock us with their hypocrisy or silliness. Thus the Government may be trying to launch a carefully crafted and cheap campaign to slow down the growth of teenage pregnancies, but to make a story the campaign needs to be expensive and stupid. So last week a \u00a32-million campaign that goes out of its way to avoid lecturing teenage girls to say 'No' was headlined by the Daily Mail as a \u00a360-million campaign to do just that. One tabloid, going for the hypocrisy angle, began a ring-round to ask Labour's women Ministers when they had lost their virginity. Unlike Parekh and Keegan, the Ministers had gone out of their way to play safe - but, whatever the facts, got bile poured over their heads as bossy, interfering, out-of-touch, amoral nannies wasting tens of millions on a purposeless exercise. </p> <p>And yet. The obsession with the personal can throw up important news dividends. As a growing number of both front benches concede they once smoked dope as they answer personal questions, there is now no chance of a Widdecombe-inspired clamp down on cannabis use. Indeed there is a growing possibility that one day some government will consider reclassifying it as a class C drug, as the Police Foundation recommended earlier this year. But this is only a possibility. The risk for any government, given our current journalistic culture, is that if it does propose something sane it will get the treatment meted out to Parekh, Keegan and the pregnancy campaign. Alastair Campbell or his successor will insist the game is just not worth the candle. </p> <p>Which is why all this matters so much. To protect themselves, public and private decision-makers place ever higher barriers between themselves and the press, fighting spin with spin and a growing army of public relations consultants. Proper journalistic access gets ever harder. Governments shrink from opening up controversial arguments, with Europe a classic example of hysterical misreporting. A fiercely independent media is the guarantor of democracy. The British media, paradoxically, may be beginning to endanger it.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Earlier this year the good citizens of various French cities, all of which were in the middle of being cabled up, were treated to a new kind of roadshow. Universal Studios Networks was doing the rounds to promote its horror channel and, somewhat bizarrely, had teamed up with Heinz to do this. </p> <p>The ketchup company was looking to target a younger audience, and linking its most famous product to a channel dedicated to dripping fangs was seen as the perfect vehicle for the product reorientation. The local press and radio stations loved the roadshow and gave it huge coverage. The marketing teams from Universal and Heinz went away well pleased. </p> <p>A gimmick, perhaps. But it is also symptomatic of the malaise at the heart of commercial television. The new dynamics affecting the industry are forcing advertisers to invent new ways of reaching consumers. </p> <p>The explosion of channels, coupled with new technologies such as video-on-demand - which whizzes what you want to watch down your phone line at the click of a remote - and Personal Video Recorders (PVRs) - set-top boxes which record your favourite programmes on a hard drive and have the ability to let you skip the ads - mean fewer and fewer people are going to watch television as they used to. </p> <p>Viewers will be able to build their own virtual television network instead, as new software works out what they like and records it for them to watch at their convenience. The Simpsons at 3:30am? No problem. </p> <p>'Television schedules will shift from a time-based paradigm to one based purely on content,' says Tim Fern, engineering director of Pace, a UK company which is set to launch its own PVR built into a set-top box next year. 'People will operate channels according to their own interests. It will have a dramatic effect on those general channels which are ad funded. Maybe this is the end for scheduling.' </p> <p>Another firm, US-based TiVo, has already launched its own PVR over here in conjunction with BSkyB. </p> <p>The television industry has been slow to wake up to what Jerel Whittingham, senior consultant with technology investment bank Durlacher, describes as an 'earthquake' or, in more prosaic terms, the shift from linear to non-linear TV. 'It was a struggle to get people to take it seriously,' Whittingham says. 'Many in the industry had no idea that people will record and watch the majority of their programmes in the future. It's such a different model that it takes a while for it to sink in.' </p> <p>The most dramatic consequence of this fragmentation of scheduling is the impending demise of mass-market advertising. 'It's the death of the channel. If most people are watching at different times, the channel is irrelevant,' Whittingham says. </p> <p>This means that those mainstream commercial channels which don't adapt to the non-linear world face major problems. 'Linear TV channels funded by conventional advertising will die,' says Stephen Adshead, of research firm Datamonitor. 'It's not going to happen overnight, but the conventional TV channels will lose out.' Datamonitor is soon to publish a report predicting that by 2005, some 21 million households in Europe will have video-on-demand, while 31 million will have PVRs. </p> <p>The PVR's ability to distinguish between programmes and ads poses serious problems for the conventional commercial broadcasting model which builds audiences around popular shows screened at key times of the day. The impact of technology that allows viewers to skip commercials will be greatest on the most popular shows. </p> <p>'These are the programmes that are most likely to be TiVo'd. It's appointment viewing,' says Tony Garland, president of Universal Studios Networks. </p> <p>But the broadcasters will find alternative revenues to compensate for the rise of the virtual television network. 'We've brought in a number of different types of control,' says Richard Cross, vice president of Interactive TV at NDS, the company that is cre ating the software for Pace's new range of set-top boxes. 'In some cases you will be able to skip the ads, perhaps if you pay a premium. In other cases you won't.' </p> <p>Fern paints a future in which viewers pay \u00a32.99 to watch a film without ads, or 99p to take it with commercials every 15 minutes. Or viewers could, for example, count the number of times the Budweiser logo features in a particular ad and, by getting it right at the end in a multi-choice quiz, win a free film-on-demand. 'In future you are effectively going to have to pay people to watch the ads,' Fern says. </p> <p>This may not be as difficult as it sounds. The new generation of devices will learn from their users' viewing habits, a process which will allow advertisers to target specific audiences because the boxes help build socio-demographic profiles of their viewers. </p> <p>Thus, the argument runs, viewers may end up watching only ads that are relevant to their lifestyles. 'If you don't have kids under the age of three, what's the point of watching an ad for nappies?' Fern asks. </p> <p>Garland argues that the complexity of programming following the death of the conventional TV channel paves the way for branded, niche, TV channels - such as Universal's horror channel. These would allow broadcasters 'to own an audience's heart rather than its eyeballs', creating loyalty ties which offer advertisers new ways of targeting discrete audiences. </p> <p>'For channels, victory is no longer in the volume of eyeballs,' says Garland. 'If your revenue is 100 per cent dependent on being able to deliver eyeballs at a particular time, then new technology is a threat. Audiences are going to fragment.' </p> <p>For commercial channels, this argument is nothing new. ITV (along with BBC1 and BBC2) has seen its market share slip as new chan nels have emerged over the past 20 years. Back in 1982, ITV (including GMTV) had a 50 per cent share of the viewing market. Last year the figure had plunged to 31 per cent, according to Barb - the British Audience Research Bureau. </p> <p>But this decline in eyeballs will increase dramatically as future generations of PVRs become ever more powerful. Currently they are capable of storing up to 60 hours of television; in five years' time they will store hundreds of hours. </p> <p>Analysts confidently predict the development of 'broadcasting portals' - themed menus which tell you where and when to find a particular programme. Fan of John Cleese? Check out the comedy portal - and the ads that go with it. </p> <p>This is known in the trade as 'disintermediation' - new technology allowing other businesses to step in between viewers and broadcasters. Commercial channels now need ensure that their programmes don't get lost in the virtual networks confusion, otherwise the advertisers will look elsewhere. </p> <p>As Cross put it: 'If you're a channel, the question you now have to ask is 'how do I get on the hard drive?' Advertisers will be asking them the same question.</p>",

The ketchup company was looking to target a younger audience, and linking its most famous product to a channel dedicated to dripping fangs was seen as the perfect vehicle for the product reorientation. The local press and radio stations loved the roadshow and gave it huge coverage. The marketing teams from Universal and Heinz went away well pleased. A gimmick, perhaps. But it is also symptomatic of the malaise at the heart of commercial television. The new dynamics affecting the industry are forcing advertisers to invent new ways of reaching consumers. The explosion of channels, coupled with new technologies such as video-on-demand - which whizzes what you want to watch down your phone line at the click of a remote - and Personal Video Recorders (PVRs) - set-top boxes which record your favourite programmes on a hard drive and have the ability to let you skip the ads - mean fewer and fewer people are going to watch television as they used to. Viewers will be able to build their own virtual television network instead, as new software works out what they like and records it for them to watch at their convenience. The Simpsons at 3:30am? No problem. 'Television schedules will shift from a time-based paradigm to one based purely on content,' says Tim Fern, engineering director of Pace, a UK company which is set to launch its own PVR built into a set-top box next year. 'People will operate channels according to their own interests. It will have a dramatic effect on those general channels which are ad funded. Maybe this is the end for scheduling.' Another firm, US-based TiVo, has already launched its own PVR over here in conjunction with BSkyB. The television industry has been slow to wake up to what Jerel Whittingham, senior consultant with technology investment bank Durlacher, describes as an 'earthquake' or, in more prosaic terms, the shift from linear to non-linear TV. 'It was a struggle to get people to take it seriously,' Whittingham says. 'Many in the industry had no idea that people will record and watch the majority of their programmes in the future. It's such a different model that it takes a while for it to sink in.' The most dramatic consequence of this fragmentation of scheduling is the impending demise of mass-market advertising. 'It's the death of the channel. If most people are watching at different times, the channel is irrelevant,' Whittingham says. This means that those mainstream commercial channels which don't adapt to the non-linear world face major problems. 'Linear TV channels funded by conventional advertising will die,' says Stephen Adshead, of research firm Datamonitor. 'It's not going to happen overnight, but the conventional TV channels will lose out.' Datamonitor is soon to publish a report predicting that by 2005, some 21 million households in Europe will have video-on-demand, while 31 million will have PVRs. The PVR's ability to distinguish between programmes and ads poses serious problems for the conventional commercial broadcasting model which builds audiences around popular shows screened at key times of the day. The impact of technology that allows viewers to skip commercials will be greatest on the most popular shows. 'These are the programmes that are most likely to be TiVo'd. It's appointment viewing,' says Tony Garland, president of Universal Studios Networks. But the broadcasters will find alternative revenues to compensate for the rise of the virtual television network. 'We've brought in a number of different types of control,' says Richard Cross, vice president of Interactive TV at NDS, the company that is cre ating the software for Pace's new range of set-top boxes. 'In some cases you will be able to skip the ads, perhaps if you pay a premium. In other cases you won't.' Fern paints a future in which viewers pay \u00a32.99 to watch a film without ads, or 99p to take it with commercials every 15 minutes. Or viewers could, for example, count the number of times the Budweiser logo features in a particular ad and, by getting it right at the end in a multi-choice quiz, win a free film-on-demand. 'In future you are effectively going to have to pay people to watch the ads,' Fern says. This may not be as difficult as it sounds. The new generation of devices will learn from their users' viewing habits, a process which will allow advertisers to target specific audiences because the boxes help build socio-demographic profiles of their viewers. Thus, the argument runs, viewers may end up watching only ads that are relevant to their lifestyles. 'If you don't have kids under the age of three, what's the point of watching an ad for nappies?' Fern asks. Garland argues that the complexity of programming following the death of the conventional TV channel paves the way for branded, niche, TV channels - such as Universal's horror channel. These would allow broadcasters 'to own an audience's heart rather than its eyeballs', creating loyalty ties which offer advertisers new ways of targeting discrete audiences. 'For channels, victory is no longer in the volume of eyeballs,' says Garland. 'If your revenue is 100 per cent dependent on being able to deliver eyeballs at a particular time, then new technology is a threat. Audiences are going to fragment.' For commercial channels, this argument is nothing new. ITV (along with BBC1 and BBC2) has seen its market share slip as new chan nels have emerged over the past 20 years. Back in 1982, ITV (including GMTV) had a 50 per cent share of the viewing market. Last year the figure had plunged to 31 per cent, according to Barb - the British Audience Research Bureau. But this decline in eyeballs will increase dramatically as future generations of PVRs become ever more powerful. Currently they are capable of storing up to 60 hours of television; in five years' time they will store hundreds of hours. Analysts confidently predict the development of 'broadcasting portals' - themed menus which tell you where and when to find a particular programme. Fan of John Cleese? Check out the comedy portal - and the ads that go with it. This is known in the trade as 'disintermediation' - new technology allowing other businesses to step in between viewers and broadcasters. Commercial channels now need ensure that their programmes don't get lost in the virtual networks confusion, otherwise the advertisers will look elsewhere. As Cross put it: 'If you're a channel, the question you now have to ask is 'how do I get on the hard drive?' Advertisers will be asking them the same question.",

He conceded that in The House of Mirth she 'made what in its day [1905] seemed a daringly realistic study of high society'. But after finding a few words of praise for Ethan Frome, her single excursion into working-class life, Muller declared that 'the bulk of her work concerns the doings of pallid gentlefolk and soon acquires the mustiness that has already sent The House of Mirth to the attic'. </p> <p>Well, Wharton and her books have long been recovered from the attic and the two most famous of them have been filmed with great distinction by Martin Scorsese and Terence Davies, blue-collar Catholics far removed from the patrician, Wasp world of Edith Wharton. Both have seen in her books the subtle perception and unflinching honesty of a writer who, from a position of confident success and social acceptance, could observe the hypocrisy, false values and cruelty of her own class. To write trenchantly, vividly on one society is to illuminate the idea of society in general. </p> <p>As he's demonstrated in the movies inspired by his Liverpool childhood and the non-autobiographical Neon Bible, Davies has a tragic, or at least stoical, view of life, and it was clearly not to escape from his customary gloom that he chose to film The House of Mirth. </p> <p>The title, which misleadingly suggests a funfair attraction, comes from Ecclesiastes ('The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; the heart of fools is in the house of mirth') and Edith Wharton regretted having adapted her first major literary success for the stage. 'I now doubt if that kind of a play, with a \"sad\" ending and a negative hero, could ever get a hearing from an American audience,' she wrote during its very brief Broadway run. In consoling her as they left the theatre, the critic and novelist William Dean Howells famously remarked: 'What the American public always wants is a tragedy with a happy ending.' </p> <p>The 29-year-old Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) follows on from Emma Bovary, Anna Karenina and Isobel Archer in the nineteenth-century tradition of self-deceiving heroines destroyed through a combination of oppressive social conventions and their own wilfulness. Lily is a 29-year-old orphan, beautiful, intelligent, witty, but dependent upon an allowance from a rich aunt and expected to secure her place in upper-class New York through marrying a rich man. </p> <p>This is a society in transition (old money is being challenged, or inveigled, by the nouveaux riches) that plays a deadly game with complex, unwritten rules which have nothing to do with ethics or morality. The consequences for losers are ostracism and banishment. </p> <p>Following Wharton's book with intelligent fidelity, the film goes to the heart of the matter with a superb opening encounter between Lily and her confidant, Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz), a hard-working lawyer with no inherited money. Like her, he lives through the hospitality of the rich. They love each other, but her ambition and his diffidence keep them apart. This lean sequence, which establishes character, milieu and values, concludes with Lily leaving Selden's apartment block and lying to its owner, the suave financier Rosedale (Anthony LaPaglia), that she's been seeing her dressmaker. </p> <p>This is the first of several hostages to fortune. As Davies forgoes an authorial commentary (one of the strengths of Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence, where Joanne Woodward spoke for Wharton), we are not told that Rosedale is a Jew. Viewers who haven't read the book may think him merely an edgily ambitious arriviste and not be aware that Lily shares the conventional anti-Semitism of her class. </p> <p>Though both Lily and Selden see through, and wittily mock, this society, they're trapped within it, in Lily's case because she lacks the skills and the political vision to break away. Ultimately, she's brought down and sent to an early grave by her decency, her vulnerability and her honesty. She rejects several wealthy suitors, falls into the hands of the blackmailing would-be seducer, Gus Trenor (Dan Aykroyd), is manipulated by a treacherous friend, the adulterous Bertha Dorset (Laura Linney) and cheated by a hypocritical cousin, (Jodhi May). </p> <p>To tell this complex story, Davies steers a course somewhere between the luxurious explicitness of Merchant-Ivory - whose admirable, not dissimilar, The Golden Bowl opens next month - and the metaphoric, elliptical, expressionist style of his previous pictures. The action proceeds through a succession of dialogues where, except in the exchanges between Lily and Selden, the real subject under discussion only occasionally disrupts the polite surface. The truth is to be found in glances and a shift in the eyes, and his whole cast serve Davies admirably. </p> <p>The movie draws for its visual style on the contemporary paintings of John Singer Sargent and James Tissot (whose work is used for the covers of several Virago editions of Wharton), but Davies, who shot all the American material on artfully dressed Scottish locations, doesn't parade the period detail. The decor is always in the background. </p> <p>The eclectic use of music is typical of Davies, but the most obviously characteristic sequence is a transition from the States to the Mediterranean where Lily is to be undone. It begins with a series of tracking shots though the dust-sheet-covered furniture of a mansion, followed by the camera moving rapidly over a rain-splattered lake that gives way to the sun catching smooth, sun-dappled water as the prow of a yacht breaks through the sea, and finally the camera pans up to buildings on the cliffs of Monte Carlo.

      "body": "<p><strong> When did you realise you wanted to get involved in film?</strong> </p> <p>After I graduated from high school I was studying writing at the New School for Social Research in New York. But I kept skipping classes. So I dropped out and went to a local community college in New Jersey. I had already worked at a string of convenience stores, and then I saw a listing in the paper for a video store clerk. And I thought, 'God, that I would love to do! What a great job sitting there controlling the ebb and flow of movies in this region, making sure the right people get the right movies.' </p> <p><strong> Was there a particular epiphany for you?</strong> </p> <p>My interest in film developed at the video shop. I starting going to film festivals and at one of those I saw Richard Linklater's film Slacker. It inspired me, not least because it was an ultra low-budget film made by someone like me. Then I looked at films by Hal Hartley and Jim Jarmusch which had a similar effect. So then I started looking at film schools because I knew that I needed to learn some technical skills. I saw an advert in the Village Voice for the Vancouver Film School. It had a 0800 number so it was worth a call - and they told me it was an eight-month programme that cost $9,000. They said: 'What we do is teach you hands-on; you get your hands on the equipment, you make films. We skip the theory element of most film schools.' That sounded good to me. </p> <p><strong> Did you make any films while you were at this school?</strong> </p> <p>Just one documentary. The course wasn't all it was cracked up to be and I went home after four months. The best thing that happened there was that I met my future producer, Scott Mosier, and my cinematographer, David Klein. </p> <p>I had to be resourceful if I wanted to be a filmmaker. So I followed the example of guerrilla filmmaker Robert Rodriguez who made El Mariachi for $7,000. He'd said: 'Take stock of what you have and work with that. I had a bus and I had a turtle, so I worked them both into the script!' I thought, I can get my hands on a convenience store. I went home, and got my job back at the convenience store, fully intending to shoot the film there. </p> <p><strong> What did you do about raising money?</strong> </p> <p>I certainly didn't want to take my 164-page script to potential investors and say, 'Do you have any cash?' I mean, 164 pages of dick jokes at a convenience store? Luckily, I had secured about a dozen credit cards over the last couple of years. I would apply saying that I was manager of RST Video and I made $50,000 a year. They'd call the video store to check. I would answer the phone: 'Yeah?' 'We're checking out a credit loan for Kevin Smith, the manager.' 'Oh. He makes $50,000 a year.' They'd say, 'Excellent!' and hang up. But suddenly I looked at these cards as a means of financing Clerks . </p> <p><strong> How did you find your camera equipment?</strong> </p> <p>Kodak had a programme for film school students where you were given 15 per cent off your film stock. Unfortunately, they only accepted people from the city so our Vancouver IDs weren't valid. Undeterred, we went down to the New School for Social Research and enrolled on a one-day course so we could get an ID card. It was called 'Roasting Suckling Pig' and the fee was $50. I signed on, and bought the film while the card was still warm from the laminating machine! Then we went back and I took my name off the course. We couldn't afford to spend $50. We rented an old clunky Arriflex SR camera. It was so loud we had to throw a leather jacket on it during filming. The shop wouldn't take credit cards, only cash. So I told my parents, 'We need $3,000 now, otherwise we can't get the equipment.' They were not well off, but somehow managed to put together some cash they had saved. </p> <p><strong> Did you have much technical knowledge?</strong> </p> <p>I hadn't stayed long enough to learn any technical knowledge at Vancouver. Thankfully Scott and David had, so David handled the camera and Scott operated the sound. Periodically David would set up the frame and ask, 'What do you think of this?' And I'd look through the lens and go, 'It looks wonderful.' Originally, I had wanted to shoot in colour, but Scott told me that we would have to rent an entire light package. If we shot in black and white we could use the store's fluorescent lights. </p> <p><strong> Were you working at the same time?</strong> </p> <p>Scott and I worked in the convenience store and the video store during the entire shoot. I would work the six till 11am shift. From 11 to five we were either sleeping or preparing for the next night's shooting. From five or six till 10.30 at night I was working again. Then from 10.30 till six in the morning we would shoot the movie. And then the day would begin again. Sometimes we would end a little earlier than 6am and we would go and sleep next door in the video store. We had pillows and some blankets and went and slept on the floor in the video store. We brought an editing unit into the video store so we could film and edit simultaneously. Scott would edit while I worked in the convenience store and vice versa. </p> <p><strong> What was the hardest thing about the shoot for you?</strong> </p> <p>At the start we had a crew of 10 people working for nothing. By the end of the first week, though, we were down to four people as the process was so boring. But the hardest thing was finding people to fill the small roles. In the final version, my friend Walter plays four roles; in the first cut he played five! We just kept changing his appearance. He just kept on popping up in the movie because he was around. Walter didn't go to sleep until early in the morning, about four or five or something. And every time somebody didn't show up for one of the roles, we were like, 'Walter, throw this jacket on.' </p> <p><strong> Was it exciting to see your film take shape and see the reactions?</strong> </p> <p>I loved the first cut of the movie. We made a poor quality video copy of it and watched it at my friend Ed's house. Just really revelled in it! The feeling was 'Wow! We made a flick! That's kind of cool!' I wanted to screen at the IFFM [Independent Feature Film Market]. That's where Richard Linklater had initially taken Slackers . We were given the Sunday morning graveyard slot. There were about 10 people in the theatre and most of them were the cast and crew! I was distraught. I couldn't believe I had spent 27 grand and nobody turned up. But Bob Hawke, one of the leading lights of the independent scene, was present. He liked the film and told a number of his contacts in the film world. Through him we got in contact with filmmakers' agent John Pierson, who had previously sold She's Gotta Have It and Roger and Me. He watched the film and agreed to represent us. </p> <p>Then we got accepted into the Sundance Film Festival, beating 600 other movies. The ending posed a problem, though. In the original a guy comes into the store and shoots Dante [the lead character] dead and robs the store. John said, 'You can't grow to love this character and then kill him because you didn't know how to end the movie.' He was insistent so we cut it before Sundance. </p> <p><strong> How did it go at Sundance?</strong> </p> <p>We had four successful screenings. It was the first time we saw the movie with a full audience and to hear the cacophonous laughter, the roaring, was a deeply satisfying feeling. But still no distributors were interested in buying the film. Then Harvey Weinstein saw it and loved it. John arranged a meeting with Harvey. He said, 'You made a fucking funny movie. I'll take it and put it on a bunch of fucking screens, show it to the right fucking people, put a fucking soundtrack in there_' Scott and I were impressed. He was our kind of guy: very blunt and very frank. So he made us an offer. The sum was very low, only $227,000. Twenty-seven grand would cover the hard cost of the movie, not the interest on the credit cards. And then we were left with a $100,000 to split between us and all the people on the cast. John said: 'We could really push for more cash but is this how you want to enter into a relationship with these people? This way we go in low. If the movie breaks out they will love you for the rest of your lives.'

      "bodyText": "When did you realise you wanted to get involved in film? After I graduated from high school I was studying writing at the New School for Social Research in New York. But I kept skipping classes. So I dropped out and went to a local community college in New Jersey. I had already worked at a string of convenience stores, and then I saw a listing in the paper for a video store clerk. And I thought, 'God, that I would love to do! What a great job sitting there controlling the ebb and flow of movies in this region, making sure the right people get the right movies.' Was there a particular epiphany for you? My interest in film developed at the video shop. I starting going to film festivals and at one of those I saw Richard Linklater's film Slacker. It inspired me, not least because it was an ultra low-budget film made by someone like me. Then I looked at films by Hal Hartley and Jim Jarmusch which had a similar effect. So then I started looking at film schools because I knew that I needed to learn some technical skills. I saw an advert in the Village Voice for the Vancouver Film School. It had a 0800 number so it was worth a call - and they told me it was an eight-month programme that cost $9,000. They said: 'What we do is teach you hands-on; you get your hands on the equipment, you make films. We skip the theory element of most film schools.' That sounded good to me. Did you make any films while you were at this school? Just one documentary. The course wasn't all it was cracked up to be and I went home after four months. The best thing that happened there was that I met my future producer, Scott Mosier, and my cinematographer, David Klein. I had to be resourceful if I wanted to be a filmmaker. So I followed the example of guerrilla filmmaker Robert Rodriguez who made El Mariachi for $7,000. He'd said: 'Take stock of what you have and work with that. I had a bus and I had a turtle, so I worked them both into the script!' I thought, I can get my hands on a convenience store. I went home, and got my job back at the convenience store, fully intending to shoot the film there. What did you do about raising money? I certainly didn't want to take my 164-page script to potential investors and say, 'Do you have any cash?' I mean, 164 pages of dick jokes at a convenience store? Luckily, I had secured about a dozen credit cards over the last couple of years. I would apply saying that I was manager of RST Video and I made $50,000 a year. They'd call the video store to check. I would answer the phone: 'Yeah?' 'We're checking out a credit loan for Kevin Smith, the manager.' 'Oh. He makes $50,000 a year.' They'd say, 'Excellent!' and hang up. But suddenly I looked at these cards as a means of financing Clerks . How did you find your camera equipment? Kodak had a programme for film school students where you were given 15 per cent off your film stock. Unfortunately, they only accepted people from the city so our Vancouver IDs weren't valid. Undeterred, we went down to the New School for Social Research and enrolled on a one-day course so we could get an ID card. It was called 'Roasting Suckling Pig' and the fee was $50. I signed on, and bought the film while the card was still warm from the laminating machine! Then we went back and I took my name off the course. We couldn't afford to spend $50. We rented an old clunky Arriflex SR camera. It was so loud we had to throw a leather jacket on it during filming. The shop wouldn't take credit cards, only cash.

      "body": "<p>The surprise winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature sat on the edge of a friend's bed in Paris and reflected on the journey that had brought him from China to France, from the obscurity of being a playwright and novelist known only to a small number of critics and intellectuals.</p> <p>There's a little party of admirers and critics in the living room, but Gao Xingjian, 60, his eyes a little tired, keeps getting dragged away to do interviews with journalists who had never heard of him before Thursday.</p> <p>He says that the Nobel Prize is 'something that falls on you from the sky like a miracle. It's a total surprise'.</p> <p>Gao, the first Chinese-language winner of the prize, is a political refugee from Communist China who has embraced France, its language and its culture, yet remains in China a potent, and proscribed, figure of dissent.</p> <p>To explain his spiritual journey he describes a dream he had when he was 15. 'I was sleeping with a marble woman. She was beautiful and cold - a statue that had fallen into the grass, and I was lost in an exuberant freedom. It was that freedom, that we call decadent, that brought me to France.'</p> <p>Of course, it is more complicated than that. His early life was difficult. He was born under the sign of chaos, his mother giving birth while bombs fell during the Sino-Japanese war.</p> <p>When he was young he developed a taste for the French surrealists like Ionesco, several of whom he later translated into Chinese. They influenced his own writing, which offended the Chinese authorities who regarded the genre as decadent and worthless.</p> <p>During the Cultural Revolution he was forced to burn much of his early work, attended re-education camps and did hard labour in the fields for six years.</p> <p>It was a terrible time, Gao recalls. His wife denounced him and he burned 'kilos and kilos' of novels, plays and articles.</p> <p>But writing was a compulsion, an obsession, and he carried on in secret. But when in 1979 he was allowed to publish, he ran into trouble again. A work of criticism was damned as 'spiritual pollution and connivance with Western literature'.</p> <p>And his plays, such as Bus Stop (1983), a kind of Zen theatre of the absurd heavily influenced by Beckett and Artaud, though performed at the Beijing Popular Theatre, were officially regarded as too decadent.</p> <p>In 1987, he left China and settled in Paris. 'I love Paris - it's the best city in the world for artists.' After the Tiananmen Square riots of 1989, his flat in Beijing was seized by the authorities.</p> <p>The massacre formed the backdrop of his most overtly political play, Fugitives, a love story. Its publication caused his work to be banned in China.</p> <p>Gao lives in a two-room apartment on the 19th floor of a tower block in Bagnolet, a tough suburb in the east of Paris. He spends 16 hours a day writing or painting. He listens to Mozart, and Messiaen. He became a French citizen in 1998 and does not consort with the Chinese community. He gets a little cross when I suggest that, like the 1994 Nobel laureate Kenzaburo Oe, his work is little known and may well benefit from the exposure the award will give him. 'No, that's not true. I am well known. Not well known among the public, but the professors and theatre people know me well.</p> <p>'In Europe, my plays are performed a lot. In the past 10 years more than 30 of my plays have been produced. But these are not plays for a big audience.' But his work is not popular - even in France where it has been extensively translated. I asked for his books at four Parisian bookshops on Friday, but they were unavailable. 'Try Tuesday,' said one proprietor. 'We've ordered a few because he's won the prize.'</p> <p>And yet, in making their award, the Swedish Academy said Gao had produced 'an oeuvre of universal validity, bitter insights and linguistic ingenuity'.</p> <p>They singled out his 1989 novel Soul Mountain for particular praise, calling it 'one of those singular literary creations that seem impossible to compare with anything but themselves'.</p> <p>Based on a 10-month walking tour Gao took along the Yangtze River, Soul Mountain uses several narrative voices, interweaving tales of people Gao met on his journey. At one point, one of these narrators criticises the novel's author: 'You've slapped together travel notes, moralistic ramblings, notes, jottings, untheoretical discussions, unfable-like fables, copied some folk songs, added some legend-like nonsense of your own, and call it fiction!'</p> <p>I ask Gao if he wants to become popular or if the prospect worries him. 'These things are not in my power. They just happen.' Is he happy about winning the \u00a3625,000 award? 'Obviously! It's the greatest prize. But I wasn't waiting for this.

      "bodyText": "The surprise winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature sat on the edge of a friend's bed in Paris and reflected on the journey that had brought him from China to France, from the obscurity of being a playwright and novelist known only to a small number of critics and intellectuals. There's a little party of admirers and critics in the living room, but Gao Xingjian, 60, his eyes a little tired, keeps getting dragged away to do interviews with journalists who had never heard of him before Thursday. He says that the Nobel Prize is 'something that falls on you from the sky like a miracle. It's a total surprise'. Gao, the first Chinese-language winner of the prize, is a political refugee from Communist China who has embraced France, its language and its culture, yet remains in China a potent, and proscribed, figure of dissent. To explain his spiritual journey he describes a dream he had when he was 15. 'I was sleeping with a marble woman. She was beautiful and cold - a statue that had fallen into the grass, and I was lost in an exuberant freedom. It was that freedom, that we call decadent, that brought me to France.' Of course, it is more complicated than that. His early life was difficult. He was born under the sign of chaos, his mother giving birth while bombs fell during the Sino-Japanese war. When he was young he developed a taste for the French surrealists like Ionesco, several of whom he later translated into Chinese. They influenced his own writing, which offended the Chinese authorities who regarded the genre as decadent and worthless. During the Cultural Revolution he was forced to burn much of his early work, attended re-education camps and did hard labour in the fields for six years. It was a terrible time, Gao recalls. His wife denounced him and he burned 'kilos and kilos' of novels, plays and articles. But writing was a compulsion, an obsession, and he carried on in secret. But when in 1979 he was allowed to publish, he ran into trouble again. A work of criticism was damned as 'spiritual pollution and connivance with Western literature'. And his plays, such as Bus Stop (1983), a kind of Zen theatre of the absurd heavily influenced by Beckett and Artaud, though performed at the Beijing Popular Theatre, were officially regarded as too decadent. In 1987, he left China and settled in Paris. 'I love Paris - it's the best city in the world for artists.' After the Tiananmen Square riots of 1989, his flat in Beijing was seized by the authorities. The massacre formed the backdrop of his most overtly political play, Fugitives, a love story. Its publication caused his work to be banned in China. Gao lives in a two-room apartment on the 19th floor of a tower block in Bagnolet, a tough suburb in the east of Paris. He spends 16 hours a day writing or painting. He listens to Mozart, and Messiaen. He became a French citizen in 1998 and does not consort with the Chinese community. He gets a little cross when I suggest that, like the 1994 Nobel laureate Kenzaburo Oe, his work is little known and may well benefit from the exposure the award will give him. 'No, that's not true. I am well known. Not well known among the public, but the professors and theatre people know me well. 'In Europe, my plays are performed a lot. In the past 10 years more than 30 of my plays have been produced. But these are not plays for a big audience.' But his work is not popular - even in France where it has been extensively translated. I asked for his books at four Parisian bookshops on Friday, but they were unavailable. 'Try Tuesday,' said one proprietor. 'We've ordered a few because he's won the prize.' And yet, in making their award, the Swedish Academy said Gao had produced 'an oeuvre of universal validity, bitter insights and linguistic ingenuity'. They singled out his 1989 novel Soul Mountain for particular praise, calling it 'one of those singular literary creations that seem impossible to compare with anything but themselves'. Based on a 10-month walking tour Gao took along the Yangtze River, Soul Mountain uses several narrative voices, interweaving tales of people Gao met on his journey. At one point, one of these narrators criticises the novel's author: 'You've slapped together travel notes, moralistic ramblings, notes, jottings, untheoretical discussions, unfable-like fables, copied some folk songs, added some legend-like nonsense of your own, and call it fiction!' I ask Gao if he wants to become popular or if the prospect worries him. 'These things are not in my power. They just happen.' Is he happy about winning the \u00a3625,000 award? 'Obviously! It's the greatest prize. But I wasn't waiting for this. It's something that falls on you from the sky like a miracle. It's a surprise. And, while this prize guarantees my independence, I don't think it will make my work better known in China. 'The award expresses a friendship which I find very moving,' says Gao. 'Because I write mostly in Chinese and yet I am not published in China, the support of my translators, critics, even journalists has been very important in getting my work known around the world. The prize, then, honours these people as well as me.' The Chinese reaction was sour. Jin Jianfan of the Chinese Writers' Association said: 'He is French and not Chinese. The reason he won it is more political than literary.'",

This is why he has taken his subtitles from Aristotle. The first volume was about Hitler's hubris - that sublime arrogance which prompted Agamemnon to step on the red carpet. Now follows nemesis, the downfall decreed for all such proud over-reachers.</p> <p>In effect, it's not much more than a structural conceit. Nemesis needs a god of unchallenged power to enforce it, and just who decreed Hitler's defeat? In the telling, Kershaw's story turns out to be much less cloudily supernatural, with no presiding metaphysical justice. Hitler survived as long as he did thanks to luck, and to the succession of minute mischances which baffled a series of would-be assassins. He made up military strategy as he went along and may have lost the war because of muddled tactics: if the Germans had reacted more swiftly on the Normandy beaches, Kershaw reckons, they might have beaten back the Allied invasion. </p> <p>This was no apocalyptic combat between good and evil. After all, as Hannah Arendt pointed out after listening to the shabby, incoherent testimony of Eichmann at his trial in Jerusalem, the Nazis deprived evil of its infernal allure and made it banal, bureaucratic, officious. </p> <p>Kershaw's Hitler is therefore mediocre, not monstrous, a blundering amateur rather than the malevolent genius of Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus or Klaus Mann's Mephisto. With his braggatry and his tantrums, Kershaw finds him pitiably infantile, 'the spoilt child turned into the would-be macho man'.</p> <p>Along with a capacity to unleash violence on a global scale, he possessed faults which were only too shamingly ordinary. He was vain, and because he refused to wear spectacles, he insisted that memoranda should be printed out in banner headlines which required the invention of a 'F\u00fchrer typewriter' with preposterously over-sized keys. He was lazy, with little patience for detailed planning, hence the reckless, ludic reliance on improvisation which made him provoke the Czech crisis in 1938. He absented himself from Berlin during the war and preferred to brood on his aquiline perch in the mountains above Salzburg. Above all, he was boring, to the point of stupefaction for those courtiers who had to sit through his all-night rigmaroles and chuckle at his sadistic whimsies in the bleary dawn. </p> <p>Despite Hitler's phobias and his carpet-biting hysterics when crossed, Kershaw refuses to declare him clinically insane. That would be an easy way out. If arraigned in an American court today, he might claim an extenuating addiction to prescribed medicines and blame the quacks who dosed him with anti-gas pills containing strychnine and belladonna, ophthalmic drops laced with cocaine and the smorgasbord of several dozen assorted tablets that he gobbled every day. It's a wonder that his arteriosclerosis, or the Parkinson's disease which involuntarily agitated his limbs, didn't make a premature end of him. </p> <p>So how did this puffed-up pub orator, virtually indistinguishable from Chaplin's caricature of him in The Great Dictator, acquire such absolute dominance of a modern, supposedly civilised state? Hitler had no ideas beyond a rabid hatred of Bolsheviks, though even this maniacal crusade was compromised when he signed his non-aggression pact with Stalin (and he soon contradicted his own contradiction by turning on Russia). His ideology was a farrago of mythical nonsense. But he understood publicity and propaganda, which can augment the individual's power by magnifying his image and making him omnipresent.</p> <p>The radio took his harangues into every German household and ensured that all his subjects were attuned to the frenzies he incited. Rehearsing his speeches in front of a mirror in order to fine-tune his gesticulation, he was the first politician for whom performance mattered more than policy. After him come Reagan, folksily ingratiating rather than nightmarish, or Tony Blair with his play-acted air of commiseration whenever a son keels over drunk in public. At least we are now merely force-fed soundbites instead of having to listen to tirades like those at the Nuremberg rallies, which lasted an average of two hours. </p> <p>Kershaw has written two huge books about Hitler. But the man inside them is dismayingly small - a hollow, self-deluding fantasist. At the end of Nemesis, we watch him decompose. A guard in the Chancellery garden nudged Hitler's incinerated corpse with his boot and it collapsed into ashes. A dental bridge was picked out of the grimy debris for purposes of identification; the rest of the F\u00fchrer, who considered himself the greatest man in history, was scooped up and sifted into a cigar box.</p> <p>Hitler has always been terrifying, but Kershaw makes him more intimately repellent. During the seizure of Poland, the Swedish industrialist Birger Dahlerus found him in a nervous funk: 'The odour from his mouth was so strong that Dahlerus was tempted to move back a step or two.' Instead of the stench of brimstone from the pit, Kershaw's Hitler exudes halitosis. It's a useful and vindictive reminder that he too, like the fellow beings he excoriated as subhuman and set out to exterminate, was little better than a bacillus.</p>",

After all, as Hannah Arendt pointed out after listening to the shabby, incoherent testimony of Eichmann at his trial in Jerusalem, the Nazis deprived evil of its infernal allure and made it banal, bureaucratic, officious. Kershaw's Hitler is therefore mediocre, not monstrous, a blundering amateur rather than the malevolent genius of Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus or Klaus Mann's Mephisto. With his braggatry and his tantrums, Kershaw finds him pitiably infantile, 'the spoilt child turned into the would-be macho man'. Along with a capacity to unleash violence on a global scale, he possessed faults which were only too shamingly ordinary. He was vain, and because he refused to wear spectacles, he insisted that memoranda should be printed out in banner headlines which required the invention of a 'F\u00fchrer typewriter' with preposterously over-sized keys. He was lazy, with little patience for detailed planning, hence the reckless, ludic reliance on improvisation which made him provoke the Czech crisis in 1938. He absented himself from Berlin during the war and preferred to brood on his aquiline perch in the mountains above Salzburg. Above all, he was boring, to the point of stupefaction for those courtiers who had to sit through his all-night rigmaroles and chuckle at his sadistic whimsies in the bleary dawn. Despite Hitler's phobias and his carpet-biting hysterics when crossed, Kershaw refuses to declare him clinically insane. That would be an easy way out. If arraigned in an American court today, he might claim an extenuating addiction to prescribed medicines and blame the quacks who dosed him with anti-gas pills containing strychnine and belladonna, ophthalmic drops laced with cocaine and the smorgasbord of several dozen assorted tablets that he gobbled every day. It's a wonder that his arteriosclerosis, or the Parkinson's disease which involuntarily agitated his limbs, didn't make a premature end of him. So how did this puffed-up pub orator, virtually indistinguishable from Chaplin's caricature of him in The Great Dictator, acquire such absolute dominance of a modern, supposedly civilised state? Hitler had no ideas beyond a rabid hatred of Bolsheviks, though even this maniacal crusade was compromised when he signed his non-aggression pact with Stalin (and he soon contradicted his own contradiction by turning on Russia). His ideology was a farrago of mythical nonsense. But he understood publicity and propaganda, which can augment the individual's power by magnifying his image and making him omnipresent. The radio took his harangues into every German household and ensured that all his subjects were attuned to the frenzies he incited. Rehearsing his speeches in front of a mirror in order to fine-tune his gesticulation, he was the first politician for whom performance mattered more than policy. After him come Reagan, folksily ingratiating rather than nightmarish, or Tony Blair with his play-acted air of commiseration whenever a son keels over drunk in public. At least we are now merely force-fed soundbites instead of having to listen to tirades like those at the Nuremberg rallies, which lasted an average of two hours. Kershaw has written two huge books about Hitler. But the man inside them is dismayingly small - a hollow, self-deluding fantasist. At the end of Nemesis, we watch him decompose. A guard in the Chancellery garden nudged Hitler's incinerated corpse with his boot and it collapsed into ashes. A dental bridge was picked out of the grimy debris for purposes of identification; the rest of the F\u00fchrer, who considered himself the greatest man in history, was scooped up and sifted into a cigar box. Hitler has always been terrifying, but Kershaw makes him more intimately repellent. During the seizure of Poland, the Swedish industrialist Birger Dahlerus found him in a nervous funk: 'The odour from his mouth was so strong that Dahlerus was tempted to move back a step or two.' Instead of the stench of brimstone from the pit, Kershaw's Hitler exudes halitosis. It's a useful and vindictive reminder that he too, like the fellow beings he excoriated as subhuman and set out to exterminate, was little better than a bacillus.",

He can follow her movements (she has gone to Portugal, a place of memory for them both), although she doesn't communicate directly. It's as if she's sending him clues, in the unusual medium of credit card records, about a mysterious crisis of which he had no inkling. </p> <p>Tim Winton, in The Riders, his Booker-shortlisted novel of five years ago, used a similar situation as his starting point, but what he was writing was a sort of adventure thriller, whose Holy Grail was the female heart. The more cerebral, unnamed narrator of Silence in October doesn't set off in pursuit of the missing Astrid. He fulfils his professional and social engagements, a trip to New York, a party, his monstrous actress mother's latest premiere. But all the time he obsessively mulls over his emotional history. </p> <p>Both he and Astrid are in their mid-forties, their two children (one Astrid's by a previous marriage) now independent. It's a tribute to Gr\u00f8ndahl's rigorous imagination that the story should have so little in common with banal narratives of mid-life crisis or empty-nest syndrome. His narrator may be an art historian, but his broodings have a philosophical force for all their fluency. </p> <p>The narrator particularly admires the work of the New York school of painters (Rothko and Pollock among them). When he stands before their work, he feels that 'their absolute presence, devoid of references, demanded my own presence, a concentration without thought, resting in the centre of the eye's gravity, precisely here, exactly now'. Here, as so often, Anne Born's translation seems to render more than the bare bones of a style, its flesh tones, even. </p> <p>The narrator acknowledges that in a certain sense he has gone missing from his marriage long before Astrid made her move, but he isn't naive enough to inhabit some ideal of 'being here now' - that's the privilege of art exclusively. As Astrid's job announces perhaps a little obtrusively (she's a film editor), the stories we tell ourselves about our choices and where they have brought us owe their coherence to everything we snip out. The continuity of our selves is just that, continuity in the cinematic sense, a suppression of discrepancies. Love discovers its reasons only retrospectively. Earlier personalities nevertheless persist within both husband and wife, but what is their status - fossils, ghosts, hostages? </p> <p>One of Gr\u00f8ndahl's recurring quirks is to resist, in his phrasing, the conventional attribution of cause and effect. The narrator describes his excitement at seeing 'the words pull themselves out of the chink at the end of my fountain pen in long, vibrating, wavy blue ribbons of damp signs that dried into the paper'. He remembers watching Astrid 'as the glow ate its way through the cigarette between her lips'. Casting a cold eye on his mother, he notices 'the hanging corners of her mouth around the lips that had kissed so many men and allowed the words of so many writers to pass through her mouth'. The words do the writing, a cigarette smokes itself, the script delivers the actress. These games echo the novel's larger unpicking of the apparently self-evident. </p> <p>There's a definite whiff of existentialism about the narrator's attempts to root out the bad faith he brought to his marriage along with the good, and to re-establish himself in authenticity of feeling. Perhaps it's only a northern-European Protestant tradition of self-scrutiny - the tradition which threw up Denmark's proto-existentialist theologian Kierkegaard.</p> <p>That the obligation to know yourself is the deflection of a religious imperative is shown by one sentence in particular. The narrator is troubled by an old girlfriend's apparently straightforward question - is he happy? - and teases out its implications. Was the source of his upset 'that I was neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm, and so spat the question out of my mouth instead of answering?' In Revelations III: 15 it is God, confronted with one who is 'lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot', who does the spitting ('I will spue thee out of my mouth'). </p> <p>So much more of Silence In October is made up of memory and introspection than action that the transitions back to the present tense are sometimes awkward. Around the three-quarters mark, the book converges on the more standard territory of the novel of adultery, without ever quite sacrificing its analytical intensity. There is no shortage of details, evocations of mood and sensation, but Gr\u00f8ndahl seems most in his element extrapolating from them. </p> <p>Michel Tournier, describing his own transformation from philosopher to novelist, wrote that it was like a munitions works having to retool at the end of hostilities to make fridges.

For Baddiel, it was the death of Diana that instigated a new era of seriousness. Vic and Emma's affair began the same day and its consequences occasion a meditation on the durability, indeed the very existence, of romance. Baddiel's style is superficially sillier than life, but ultimately sadder. The biggest questions - Can we cure Aids? Who killed Diana? - allude to our triviality and the scale of our tragedies. Such is the web-like intricacy of the plot that it is almost ephemeral until you're caught in it, grimly enthralled. </p> <p> <strong> A Good Place to Die</strong><br>James Buchan<br>Harvill \u00a36.99, pp343<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000240090,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>While every other book nowadays is described loosely as an 'odyssey' of some kind, A Good Place to Die attempts to rewrite the Iliad, Odyssey and the Aeneid, setting them further east and couching them in the style of an anglicised Omar Khayyam. John Pitt, a naive English teacher, is separated from his wife during Iran's revolution, and after a decade of torture and incarceration, enlists to fight for his adopted country in the turbulent Eighties.</p> <p>Orphaned and perennially exiled, but never believing himself a widower, he rejects hippie hedonism for the strictures of Islam, finally surrendering to the Divine Will when he walks into a minefield to rescue a peasant girl. Eventually, of course, Pitt finds his Penelope and his Latium - his new spiritual homeland - after Iran has been all but sacked, yet Buchan has the talent to maintain tension to the last.</p> <p> <strong> My Movie Business</strong><br>John Irving<br>Black Swan \u00a36.99, pp158<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000093613,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Few writers have seen their work translated from paper to celluloid as successfully as John Irving. The bulk of this memoir is a re-telling of the (production of the) Oscar-winning The Cider House Rules, but there is also a minute history of America's policy on abortion. As it happens, Irving's grandfather, a great surgeon immortalised for his authorship of a ribald drinking song, was his literary inspiration, for his ability to inject humour into the most unlikely subjects. My Movie Business touches on the relationships between biography and fiction, form and content, humour and horror, literature and film. Although this is too slight to appeal to non-completists, it's a worthy addition to the oeuvre. Now that he's a full-time writer, at the peak of his powers, Irving's next real novel should be spectacular. </p> <p> <strong> La Grande Th\u00e9r\u00e8se</strong> <br>Hilary Spurling<br>Profile Books \u00a35.99, pp134<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502451808,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Spurling's last three biographies have been so highly lauded, it's strange to find her fourth so skeletal. Short on analysis and short of breath, the extravagance of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Humbert is unfortunately not matched by the style of her life story. La Grande Th\u00e9r\u00e8se had the audacity to borrow the millions needed to purchase a chateau she never lived in, because it never occurred to anyone that they wouldn't be reimbursed.</p> <p>That wasn't her greatest coup, though; it was more like a publicity stunt to launch her career as a swindler. Imaginary suitor, an imaginary inheritance and an oversized strongbox were all part of the ploy. This bodes well for the story's TV adaptation, but its present form is frustrating in its brevity and disengagement. </p> <p> <strong> On the Move: Feminism for a New Generation</strong><br>edited by Natasha Walter<br>Virago \u00a37.99, pp186<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502453145,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>'Unless we create a new kind of sisterhood... we are in danger of [concluding] that middle-class women have the luxury... of deciding that the movement has had its day.' Although a sizeable but unsatisfactory proportion of (mostly Western) women have parity with men, they account for only three per cent of women worldwide.</p> <p>The cynical view would be that feminism enabled women to be exploited on male terms, and yet the writers here never quite discredit such a view. Feminism, it seems, has lost the thrill of discovery, the momentum of revolution, and the overriding tone of this accessible, varied and articulate collection verges on pessimism. The incontestable essays by teenagers prove how glaringly obvious the continuing inequality is.

      "bodyText": "Whatever Love Means David Baddiel Abacus \u00a36.99, pp310 Buy it at BOL It all stopped being funny when every last comic tried to cash in and turn to writing, which is perhaps why the more astute social commentators (and Baddiel is easily the equal of Sean Hughes) have turned to darker matters. For Baddiel, it was the death of Diana that instigated a new era of seriousness. Vic and Emma's affair began the same day and its consequences occasion a meditation on the durability, indeed the very existence, of romance. Baddiel's style is superficially sillier than life, but ultimately sadder. The biggest questions - Can we cure Aids? Who killed Diana? - allude to our triviality and the scale of our tragedies. Such is the web-like intricacy of the plot that it is almost ephemeral until you're caught in it, grimly enthralled. A Good Place to Die James Buchan Harvill \u00a36.99, pp343 Buy it at BOL While every other book nowadays is described loosely as an 'odyssey' of some kind, A Good Place to Die attempts to rewrite the Iliad, Odyssey and the Aeneid, setting them further east and couching them in the style of an anglicised Omar Khayyam. John Pitt, a naive English teacher, is separated from his wife during Iran's revolution, and after a decade of torture and incarceration, enlists to fight for his adopted country in the turbulent Eighties. Orphaned and perennially exiled, but never believing himself a widower, he rejects hippie hedonism for the strictures of Islam, finally surrendering to the Divine Will when he walks into a minefield to rescue a peasant girl. Eventually, of course, Pitt finds his Penelope and his Latium - his new spiritual homeland - after Iran has been all but sacked, yet Buchan has the talent to maintain tension to the last. My Movie Business John Irving Black Swan \u00a36.99, pp158 Buy it at BOL Few writers have seen their work translated from paper to celluloid as successfully as John Irving. The bulk of this memoir is a re-telling of the (production of the) Oscar-winning The Cider House Rules, but there is also a minute history of America's policy on abortion. As it happens, Irving's grandfather, a great surgeon immortalised for his authorship of a ribald drinking song, was his literary inspiration, for his ability to inject humour into the most unlikely subjects. My Movie Business touches on the relationships between biography and fiction, form and content, humour and horror, literature and film. Although this is too slight to appeal to non-completists, it's a worthy addition to the oeuvre. Now that he's a full-time writer, at the peak of his powers, Irving's next real novel should be spectacular. La Grande Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Hilary Spurling Profile Books \u00a35.99, pp134 Buy it at BOL Spurling's last three biographies have been so highly lauded, it's strange to find her fourth so skeletal. Short on analysis and short of breath, the extravagance of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Humbert is unfortunately not matched by the style of her life story. La Grande Th\u00e9r\u00e8se had the audacity to borrow the millions needed to purchase a chateau she never lived in, because it never occurred to anyone that they wouldn't be reimbursed. That wasn't her greatest coup, though; it was more like a publicity stunt to launch her career as a swindler. Imaginary suitor, an imaginary inheritance and an oversized strongbox were all part of the ploy. This bodes well for the story's TV adaptation, but its present form is frustrating in its brevity and disengagement. On the Move: Feminism for a New Generation edited by Natasha Walter Virago \u00a37.99, pp186 Buy it at BOL 'Unless we create a new kind of sisterhood... we are in danger of [concluding] that middle-class women have the luxury... of deciding that the movement has had its day.' Although a sizeable but unsatisfactory proportion of (mostly Western) women have parity with men, they account for only three per cent of women worldwide. The cynical view would be that feminism enabled women to be exploited on male terms, and yet the writers here never quite discredit such a view. Feminism, it seems, has lost the thrill of discovery, the momentum of revolution, and the overriding tone of this accessible, varied and articulate collection verges on pessimism. The incontestable essays by teenagers prove how glaringly obvious the continuing inequality is. There is no more required reading, just action. \u0095 Michael Mellor Gore Vidal Fred Kaplan Bloomsbury \u00a38.99, pp850 Buy it at BOL Fred Kaplan has previously produced biographies of Dickens, Henry James and Thomas Carlyle, and includes in this expansive and fascinating book a story about standing with his present subject in a graveyard and explaining how he usually prefers his writers dead.

He has managed to escape from Prague, with the help of his magic teacher, Bernard Kornblum, but has had to leave his family behind after the German occupation of the city. Chabon brings Jewish mysticism from Prague to Brooklyn in the form of the Golem.</p> <p>The Golem is 'Rabbi Loew's mysterious automaton', whom, centuries back, Rabbi Loew conjured out of mud to save the Jewish people from destruction. As the story goes, after the Golem begins to cause his own forms of destruction, Rabbi Loew buries the Golem's clay body in case he is ever needed again. When the Germans occupy Prague in the Thirties, a committee of Jewish elders decides that the Golem's body must be sent away to protect it and his coffin becomes the means of departure for Josef. Stashed in the bottom, Josef escapes to his aunt's home in Brooklyn. </p> <p>Josef and Sammy discover their compatible artistic and narrative talents and convince Sammy's boss, Sheldon Anapol - head of Empire Novelty, soon to become Empire Comics - to start distributing comic books, which Josef and Sammy will create. Desperate to help his own family escape, Josef hits upon an idea for a new superhero with Sammy. Their hero is the Escapist, a masked man in tights who can perform daring acts of chain-breaking, lock-loosening and other feats of liberation. The Escapist, while a typical superhero in appearance, serves an additional purpose: he fights Hitler and the Nazis to liberate the Jews and other oppressed peoples. The Escapist takes off - and Josef and Sammy become Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay, Americanising their names to become a great comic book team. </p> <p>Best known for Wonder Boys, his novel turned film, Chabon's greatest skill lies in his combination of imaginative fiction and practical research. His prose, however, is neither fluid nor flawless. Joe's faltering English often seems unrealistically so; some of Chabon's secondary characters blur in the background of comic-book action heroes and artists. </p> <p>But what does make his novel an adventure wholly worth undertaking is the endearing and mysterious Joe, the misunderstood Sam, and their own personal and professional journeys. You read through Joe's angry anti-German stage, where he deliberately picks fights with any German-sounding or Nazi-thinking person he meets. You read eagerly as Joe falls in love with Rosa Saks, daughter of art magnate Longman Harkoo, and as she turns him into a softer man who puts all of his preciously saved salary (the comic business has been lucrative) into an account for his family. You read on as Sam falls for Tracy Bacon, an actor who plays the Escapist in the radio version of the story, and as Sammy realises that he is afraid to admit his love for another man </p> <p>To divulge any more would be cruel. Suffice to say that Joe and Sam and Rosa retain their own demons; the war takes its toll on all of them. But what remains impressive about this novel is Chabon's ability to find a comic book character who so describes the time and place about which he writes. And in telling all of this, he's written an adventure story that keeps you up until 4am with the bedside lamp on, eager to learn if the Escapist, and Chabon himself, can free the enslaved and lead them home.</p>",

Desperate to help his own family escape, Josef hits upon an idea for a new superhero with Sammy. Their hero is the Escapist, a masked man in tights who can perform daring acts of chain-breaking, lock-loosening and other feats of liberation. The Escapist, while a typical superhero in appearance, serves an additional purpose: he fights Hitler and the Nazis to liberate the Jews and other oppressed peoples. The Escapist takes off - and Josef and Sammy become Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay, Americanising their names to become a great comic book team. Best known for Wonder Boys, his novel turned film, Chabon's greatest skill lies in his combination of imaginative fiction and practical research. His prose, however, is neither fluid nor flawless. Joe's faltering English often seems unrealistically so; some of Chabon's secondary characters blur in the background of comic-book action heroes and artists. But what does make his novel an adventure wholly worth undertaking is the endearing and mysterious Joe, the misunderstood Sam, and their own personal and professional journeys. You read through Joe's angry anti-German stage, where he deliberately picks fights with any German-sounding or Nazi-thinking person he meets. You read eagerly as Joe falls in love with Rosa Saks, daughter of art magnate Longman Harkoo, and as she turns him into a softer man who puts all of his preciously saved salary (the comic business has been lucrative) into an account for his family. You read on as Sam falls for Tracy Bacon, an actor who plays the Escapist in the radio version of the story, and as Sammy realises that he is afraid to admit his love for another man To divulge any more would be cruel. Suffice to say that Joe and Sam and Rosa retain their own demons; the war takes its toll on all of them. But what remains impressive about this novel is Chabon's ability to find a comic book character who so describes the time and place about which he writes. And in telling all of this, he's written an adventure story that keeps you up until 4am with the bedside lamp on, eager to learn if the Escapist, and Chabon himself, can free the enslaved and lead them home.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Vogue Women </strong><br>Georgina Howell<br>Pavilion \u00a325, pp192</p> <p>Georgina Howell's Vogue Women is a coffee-table book with a message. It claims to show, in nearly 200 pages of glamorous portraits, how the place of women in society has altered over the past century. Not ordinary women, you understand - only, as it were, society women in society. These are photographs taken for the pages of Vogue magazine: politics has no place, and those of less fortunate physique must be 'edited', as Howell explains, before they are ready for their close-up. Whatever else these people may have done, the camera has already loved them. </p> <p>The aim of Vogue, Howell writes, has always been to 'induce aspiration', which sounds more like a painful medical procedure than a wistful daydream. The women in this book reflect not just fashion, it is supposed, but the changing shape of who we have wanted to be. This sounds a rather promising thought: might some new information be revealed by leafing through a series of over-familiar images of Coco Chanel, Princess Diana, Josephine Baker and Vivien Leigh? </p> <p>The answer, inevitably, is no. The hypothetical 'we' of the aspiring public must, for the most part, be a fallacy. No matter what decade or century they live in, some people will always wish they looked more like Grace Kelly, while others prefer Stella Tennant. Even Edith Sitwell has had her fashionable followers. Aspiring to be Jackie Kennedy was not the same as aspiring to be Marilyn Monroe, at exactly the same moment in history. Generalisations simply cannot be made. 'We opened the century wanting to look like aristocrats or actresses,' Howell proclaims, 'and ended it wanting to look like television presenters and the wives of football stars.' Is there a little snobbery to be detected in the comment, a sniffy woe at the extinction of the British aristocracy and its replacement by Victoria Beckham? </p> <p>Howell, a distinguished fashion editor and journalist, seems quite attached to the days when debutantes were 'backed like racehorses'. At one time, she suggests, the purpose of beauty was to attract a husband, and so good looks 'cultivated happy families'; now beauty only leads to depression - she cites Monroe and Diana as evidence. The stories Howell appears to cherish most are those of high-class unions - who married Aly Khan or the Marquis de la Falaise; who snapped up a count or a duke.</p> <p>The way she tells it, you could be forgiven for thinking that women's aspirations haven't changed at all: the time-honoured ambition to ensnare a rich man cuts right across the century - so much so that one wonders where the Sixties went. Elizabeth Taylor, an icon of more tucked-in times, memorably illustrates the point when she is quoted as saying, 'I don't think you have to burn bras. I like bras, and I love lace underwear!' </p> <p>The book contains a token section on women who have actually done things - Bridget Riley and Martha Graham are here, along with Marina Warner and Rebecca West - but in the main it is filled with women famous for being 'beauties'. As if to prove that it would not otherwise be a pleasant viewing experience, Vogue Women bundles the unbeautiful into a double-page spread so horrific it should be preceded by a warning: don't look now, it's Margaret Thatcher and Mother Teresa. A 'beauty' in Vogue terms is not just someone who is beautiful. She is, Howell explains, 'a recognised phenomenon', a person seen in the right places with the right people. This is beauty as conspiracy theory; it is in the eye of the beholder, and not just any beholder will do. </p> <p>Of course, the author is faithfully representing the ethos of the magazine, and her familiarity with its history yields some good anecdotes. Mrs Exeter, for example, was a fictional character invented by the editors in the Sixties, who was designed to prevent the alienation of older readers at a time when all was bent on youth. While David Bailey shot Jean Shrimpton sprawling on the floor, while sex was plastered over every fashion page, Mrs Exeter went to christenings in sombre suits. Howell also quotes a wonderful coverline from an old back issue: 'Is Ageing Really Necessary?' - a phrase which combines the narcissistic anxiety of the society girl with the indomitable impatience of the British schoolmistress. </p> <p>But this book is really about the pictures. Many are familiar old favourites, but some are startling. There is a shot of Uma Thurman's mother, Nena, a favourite model of Norman Parkinson, leaning against a white sports car in 1958, looking like a thin sliver of her daughter. There is Lee Radziwill, more perfect than Jackie; Jeanne Moreau, close up with a cigarette; Gwyneth Paltrow, looking modern, healthy and much less prim then usual. </p> <p>Some of the most beautiful shots in the book are barely photographs of women at all: they are fashion pictures, portraits of a line, a look, a colour scheme. Parkinson photographed Adele Collins at the end of the Fifties, in front of an antique embroidered wall-hanging; the background is in focus, in all its shabby luxury, and in the foreground is a blur, a swathe of vivid red from a hat, a spot of lipstick in the same colour and, in between, on a powder-pale face, the soft black outlines of two eyes. It is as if the girl had been painted in watercolour and was now drowning somewhere, her contours wearing off. Or maybe that's just what happens to women when they aspire too much.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>The Prime Minister: the Office and its Holders since 1945</strong><br>Peter Hennessy<br>Allen Lane/ Penguin Press \u00a325, pp704<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501839233,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>'Have you got a copy of the British constitution?' Woodrow Wyatt wrote to Margaret Thatcher at the height of the Westland crisis. 'I would like to see one.' The question was ironic: we do not have a written constitution. In our system, the Prime Minister can do what he or she likes, for as long as he or she can get away with it. Or, as Asquith put it: 'The office of the Prime Minister is what the holder chooses and is able to make of it.' </p> <p>Peter Hennessy's new book examines how the 11 holders of the office since 1945 have interpreted their powers. At one extreme, the Prime Minister is simply primus inter pares, chairman of the Cabinet; at the other (as many people complain about the present incumbent), he is virtually a President. </p> <p>The determining factor is the relationship between the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. The usual practice has been that important policies are endorsed by Cabinet, with Ministers taking collective responsibility for decisions reached there. (Sometimes it has proved impossible to reach a consensus; in the mid-1970s, for example, Labour Ministers 'agreed to disagree' about continued membership of the Common Market.) But there is no constitutional obligation on a Prime Minister to consult his Cabinet colleagues, or to take a vote in Cabinet to determine majority opinion on any issue. </p> <p>Prime Ministers have varied greatly in their conduct of Cabinet. Harold Wilson let his colleagues ramble on, while Thatcher made her opinions known at the start, pre-empting free debate. Macmillan encouraged wide-ranging discussion on broad themes, using the Cabinet as a sounding-board; James Callaghan, preoccupied with trying to hold together a divided party, allowed his Ministers to 'talk and talk and talk as long as they liked'.</p> <p>The present Prime Minister is impatient of protracted Cabinets; meetings nowadays seldom last more than an hour, and have been known to be as short as 30 minutes. Under Blair, there are fewer than half the number of Cabinet meetings that there were under Attlee, and far fewer papers circulated beforehand. Policy is determined by the Prime Minister and Ministers individually, and rubber-stamped by Cabinet afterwards. Indeed, says Hennessy, by the end of the twentieth century it was clear that 'the system of Cabinet government was, for all practical purposes, dead'.</p> <p>Of course, there are dangers for a Prime Minister who adopts too presidential an approach. Argument within Cabinet acts as a safety-valve, releasing pressures building up within the party; if discussion is stifled, this pressure mounts. Without the consensus achieved in Cabinet, Ministers are free to disclaim responsibility for unpopular policies. In Hennessy's view, Thatcher effectively suspended the system of Cabinet government. In the end, she found that her dictatorial methods had made her too many enemies and she was rejected by her own party. </p> <p>Hennessy makes it clear that the powers of the Prime Minister have been 'stretched' by the development of nuclear weapons. Churchill decided (together with the US President) to build the bomb and to use it against the Japanese without consulting his Ministers.

      "bodyText": "The Prime Minister: the Office and its Holders since 1945 Peter Hennessy Allen Lane/ Penguin Press \u00a325, pp704 Buy it at BOL 'Have you got a copy of the British constitution?' Woodrow Wyatt wrote to Margaret Thatcher at the height of the Westland crisis. 'I would like to see one.' The question was ironic: we do not have a written constitution. In our system, the Prime Minister can do what he or she likes, for as long as he or she can get away with it. Or, as Asquith put it: 'The office of the Prime Minister is what the holder chooses and is able to make of it.' Peter Hennessy's new book examines how the 11 holders of the office since 1945 have interpreted their powers. At one extreme, the Prime Minister is simply primus inter pares, chairman of the Cabinet; at the other (as many people complain about the present incumbent), he is virtually a President. The determining factor is the relationship between the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. The usual practice has been that important policies are endorsed by Cabinet, with Ministers taking collective responsibility for decisions reached there. (Sometimes it has proved impossible to reach a consensus; in the mid-1970s, for example, Labour Ministers 'agreed to disagree' about continued membership of the Common Market.) But there is no constitutional obligation on a Prime Minister to consult his Cabinet colleagues, or to take a vote in Cabinet to determine majority opinion on any issue. Prime Ministers have varied greatly in their conduct of Cabinet. Harold Wilson let his colleagues ramble on, while Thatcher made her opinions known at the start, pre-empting free debate. Macmillan encouraged wide-ranging discussion on broad themes, using the Cabinet as a sounding-board; James Callaghan, preoccupied with trying to hold together a divided party, allowed his Ministers to 'talk and talk and talk as long as they liked'. The present Prime Minister is impatient of protracted Cabinets; meetings nowadays seldom last more than an hour, and have been known to be as short as 30 minutes. Under Blair, there are fewer than half the number of Cabinet meetings that there were under Attlee, and far fewer papers circulated beforehand. Policy is determined by the Prime Minister and Ministers individually, and rubber-stamped by Cabinet afterwards. Indeed, says Hennessy, by the end of the twentieth century it was clear that 'the system of Cabinet government was, for all practical purposes, dead'. Of course, there are dangers for a Prime Minister who adopts too presidential an approach. Argument within Cabinet acts as a safety-valve, releasing pressures building up within the party; if discussion is stifled, this pressure mounts. Without the consensus achieved in Cabinet, Ministers are free to disclaim responsibility for unpopular policies. In Hennessy's view, Thatcher effectively suspended the system of Cabinet government. In the end, she found that her dictatorial methods had made her too many enemies and she was rejected by her own party. Hennessy makes it clear that the powers of the Prime Minister have been 'stretched' by the development of nuclear weapons. Churchill decided (together with the US President) to build the bomb and to use it against the Japanese without consulting his Ministers. In 1954, he informed the Cabinet that a decision to build a British bomb had been taken, leading to a vigorous protest against such a cavalier announcement. The awesome power to launch a nuclear attack within minutes has been at the disposal of every Prime Minister since Macmillan, marking them out still further from their colleagues. Another distinguishing factor stressed by Hennessy is the Prime Minister's access to secret information provided by the security services. Peter Hennessy was a journalist before he became a historian, and he remains a hybrid, combining meticulous scholarship with proximity to those he is studying. For many years, he has presided over seminars in which recently retired politicians and civil servants are encouraged to share their secrets. In a series of scholarly works, he has established himself as the most authoritative exponent of that oxymoron, 'contemporary history'.

The beginnings of scepticism, of doubting what had previously seemed obvious to the smallest child, were marked in Newton and Descartes, and by the eighteenth century, nothing seemed certain any longer. Everything was up for grabs and the demolition of scientific, moral and political certainties which took place in the course of 100 years seems, in retrospect, like the beginning of maturity. </p> <p>The Enlightenment is customarily thought of as a European phenomenon. Some historians, indeed, have gone as far as to think that the idea of an 'English Enlightenment' is a paradoxical or even an absurd one. But the eighteenth century itself did not think of it that way. After Voltaire's Lettres Philosophiques, England was a by-word in Europe for an ideal, free and politically liberal society, where men could speak their minds. Thanks to Newton, who was revered to the point of idolatry, English science was the most brilliant in Europe. Literature thrived in the atmosphere of freedom; painting, in the course of the century, produced a lively and inventive native school. </p> <p>The great contribution of the age, however, was to undermine religious belief. It was often remarked that faith was not a matter of furious national debate, due to its permitted variety; as Voltaire said, England was a nation of many faiths but only one sauce. And within this wild variety ('Arminians, Socinians, Baxterians, Presbyterians, New Americans, Sabellians') there were some genuinely durable ideas being quietly worked out. Deism and even atheism were not forbidden and disgraceful intellectual positions, but the professed conclusions of some of the most admired minds of the age. </p> <p>If there was no English Voltaire to cry: '\u00c9crasez l'inf\u00e2me', the age thought that was largely because there was no infamy to crush, no burning of heretics. The archbishops might be powerful and admired, but they did not run the country, and soon would not rule men's minds. Religious belief would not disappear overnight and, indeed, it has proved surprisingly durable, but the assaults of Hume and Gibbon on Christianity were something from which it would never quite recover. There were plenty of people who were starting to realise that, in the words of the lampoon, 'What the devil spoke, Sir/ 'Twas nothing but a joke, Sir,/ And well invented flam'. At the beginning of the century, Swift was writing an 'Argument Against the Abolition of Christianity' as a joke; by the end, that would not seem so funny any longer. </p> <p>The English Enlightenment was, above all, a worldly age, one deeply interested in the world, and one to which nothing human was alien or automatically to be condemned. Roy Porter remarks that its 'great historical watershed lay in the validation of pleasure'. That seems absolutely right; the uses of pleasure, the purpose and meaning of pleasure started to be understood, and not just automatically condemned. The economist Mandeville's argument, in The Fable of the Bees, that public benefits could flow from private vices seemed alarmingly cynical at first, but by the end of the century, as Adam Smith pursued his notion of the 'invisible hand', a large part of human existence seemed an inappropriate subject to expound moralising reflections on. </p> <p>And, in a more general sense, the indulgence of pleasure enriched national life. London was extremely relaxed about the notion of idling away a day in the coffee houses, to the astonishment of continental visitors; the moral they always drew from it was that it had indirectly given rise to the peculiar nature of national life. If Londoners were, to an unmatched degree, egalitarian, that was because tradesmen and noblemen frequented the same places. If they were philosophical, sceptical, wildly argumentative, that was because they did not worry about wasting hours on end and had to find something to talk about. </p> <p>Roy Porter has written a superb guide to the intellectual life of the period, which gets almost everything right and conveys an enormous amount of learned information lightly. It is firmly focused on the prime movers - Locke, Hume, Hartley and Mandeville - which is probably right in this context. It is true that the fascination of the age lies largely in the uses and misuses to which Enlightenment was put, by the great creative figures - Swift, Pope, Hogarth, Reynolds, Johnson and Fielding. But that is really another book, and we have to admit that Pope for one, supremely great as he is, usually got things wrong. The age cannot be seen, in any sense, as one in which 'Universal Darkness Buries All'. Quite the reverse, and Pope knew that perfectly well; yet his perverse spirit is at the heart of the English Enlightenment. </p> <p>There are a couple of quibbles. I would have liked much more about Gibbon, whose account of the rise of Christianity did most to change the collective mind. It would have been nice, too, to have heard something substantial about Empire, which is not just a historical adventure, but a significant topic in the Enlightenment mind. And there are occasional oddities; it is curious to describe a group portrait by Hogarth as demonstrating that 'polite society liked to be painted in informal groups, playing with children and pets', when one of the figures in the painting is a mythological creature, the wife is actually dead and the children are destroying the library. </p> <p>But overwhelmingly, this is a book which has understood the age, which sees it clearly and, a surprisingly rare virtue, loves and sympathises with its dashing, dazzling spirit. </p> <p>Locke, one of many presiding geniuses of the age, had long before suggested that an individual man learns by progressing through experience from ignorance to knowledge. The century increasingly thought that what was true of a man might also be true of a society, and they took the first step towards wisdom. They realised that they were ignorant and set themselves to inquiry. </p> <p>The result was the most brilliant intellectual moment in European history, and it has inspired a brilliant, lucid and admirable book.</p>",

      "bodyText": "President Bill Clinton yesterday announced that he will fly to Egypt tomorrow in a desperate bid to end two weeks of Israeli-Palestinian violence that threatens to plunge the region into full-scale conflict. Clinton said he would attend the emergency summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik, following confirmation from both Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that they would meet face to face in an attempt to negotiate a ceasefire in the violence that has claimed more than 100 largely Palestinian lives and seen thousands injured. A grim-faced president told a hastily convened White House press conference that he 'would do everything to minimise the violence and to do all the preparation necessary to maximise the chances of a successful meeting'. The announcement that both sides were prepared to attend the summit comes after furious efforts by the US president and other senior international figures over the past eight days to end the crisis in the Middle East, where a lasting peace has been a priority for his administration. As violence continued across Israel and the Palestinian Territories the question being asked was whether either Barak or Arafat was in a position to control extremists in their numbers. And in one of the biggest gambles of his long leadership of the Palestinian people Yasser Arafat agreed yesterday that he would attend despite Israel's refusal to accede to his demand that an independent international commission of inquiry into the violence be established. Arafat's agreement to talk peace without conditions is a highly risky strategy as mood among Palestinians appears to be hardening against any hint of concessions to Israel whose forces have been responsible for the vast majority of the fatalities. Many now believe that Arafat has been too hasty already in his negotiations with Israel both in the Oslo Peace deal in 1993 and in the Wye Valley agreement that saw the PLO abandon its commitment to destroying the Israeli state. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, who has been in the region for a week brokering an end to the bloodshed, said the summit would take place in Egypt today or tomorrow, and without preconditions. Speaking yesterday Annan said: 'There were no preconditions. There were suggestions.' Each side was quick to name those 'suggestions'. Nabil Shaath, a senior Arafat aide, said the Palestinians expected an Israeli retreat from the edge of Palestinian-controlled towns, and the loosening of a closure that would allow medicine and food into the Palestinian areas. Not appearing on anyone's list was the Palestinian demand to convene an international inquiry into the reasons for the violence. Barak had adamantly rejected that condition, saying that he only trusted the United States to lead such an inquiry. Barak's office said the summit would not treat the substantive peace issues that have been all but waylaid by the violence. Instead, he suggested the summit would formalise a ceasefire. The announcement came as Annan said he had called on both sides to cease shooting, which was yesterday being ignored. 'I have asked both sides to stop firing until the summit,\" he said. Annan said he expected Clinton and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to work out the details. In Washington, a White House spokesman said Clinton was awaiting word from President Mubarak 'as to whether he feels the conditions are in place to convene a summit'.",

      "bodyText": "The Middle East crisis took a sinister new twist yesterday when a London-bound Saudi jet carrying 95 passengers, mostly Britons, was seized by a hijacker armed with high explosives. The plane, which was also carrying a Saudi prince, had taken off from Jeddah yesterday afternoon. It is reported to have stopped off in Damascus briefly before heading for Baghdad last night. The hijacker was thought to be operating alone on the plane, and while in Damascus had threatened to blow it up if he was not allowed to fly on to Iraq. The dangerous ratcheting up of tension came as President Clinton launched a desperate bid to rein in the violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by announcing that he would fly to Cairo today for a summit, bringing together Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Flight SV115 from Jeddah, with a crew of 17, had been due to land at Heathrow at 5.40pm yesterday, but at 1.55pm, as the Boeing 777-200 left Egyptian air space, the pilot told the control tower at Cairo airport he was being forced to fly to Baghdad by a hijacker. 'The plane had entered Cypriot airspace, and radio contact was lost after that,' said an Egyptian civil aviation authority official. Later the captain told the control tower at Larnaca, Cyprus: 'The hijacker is saying that he has TNT [explosives] on board and he might blow the aircraft, and we have passengers from all kinds of nationalities.' Syrian authorities had initially denied the plane permission to land, forcing it and its passengers into an agonising holding position above the eastern Mediterranean. The plane was reported to have been on the tarmac at Damascus for about an hour before heading for Iraq, where it landed at about 6pm (GMT). The Saudi Aviation Minister said last night that most of the passengers were Britons but some were from South Africa and Yemen. Heathrow authorities had last night set up an emergency room in Terminal Three for families and friends who had come to greet the passengers off the plane. Saudi Arabian Airlines were unable to say how many terrorists were involved in the hijack plot or what their demands were. There was speculation last night that the hijackers were Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the Saudi stance in the Middle East crisis, and could be linked to the terrorist Osama bin Laden. As the hijack drama unfolded, Clinton announced he would attend an emergency summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik, following confirmation from both Barak and Arafat that they would meet face to face to attempt to negotiate a ceasefire to end the fighting that has claimed more than 100 lives in recent weeks. As violence continued across Israel and the Palestinian Territories the question being asked was whether either Barak or Arafat was in a position to control extremists in their numbers. And in one of the biggest gambles of his long leadership Arafat agreed yesterday to attend the summit despite Israel's refusal to accede to his demand that an independent international commission of inquiry into the violence be established. Arafat's agreement to talk peace without conditions is a highly risky strategy as the mood among Palestinians appears to be hardening against any hint of concessions to Israel whose forces have been responsible for the vast majority of the fatalities. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been in the region for a week brokering an end to the bloodshed, said that the summit would take place today or tomorrow, and without preconditions. He called on both sides to cease shooting. Arafat's announcement is in sharp contradiction to comments made yesterday to a funeral crowd of several thousand in the Palestinian-controlled town of Hebron where Fatah fighters closely associated with his regime called for new attacks on Israeli settlers and the Israeli armed forces. The comments also suggested that Barak has little chance of seeing his demand met that Arafat re-arrest dozens of Hamas militants released from Palestinian detention in the last week. Yesterday clashes continued between Palestinians and the Israeli Defence Force. In Hebron Palestinian youths stoned Israeli soldiers in the centre of the town, drawing fire from the soldiers.",

      "bodyText": "The new President of Yugoslavia, Vojislav Kostunica, promised yesterday to co-operate with the drive to try his predecessor for war crimes but also made it clear it was not a priority. He spoke after an emotional meeting with Javier Solana, the former Nato secretary general who sanctioned the bombing of his country during the Kosovo war. The two men shook hands as Kostunica was ceremonially welcomed into the European fold at the close of an informal EU summit in Biarritz. The EU has agreed an initial \u00a3120 million emergency aid package for heating oil, medicines and essential supplies this winter but diplomats have privately made clear future cash will depend on Serbia's progress down a democratic path, including co-operating with attempts to make Milosevic stand trial for war crimes in The Hague. Kostunica said he had met Solana but added: 'There is a lot of work to be done to repair the damage that was done by Nato. It is difficult to forget but we must also look at the future.' He signalled he would co-operate with the international war crimes tribunal as 'this is an obligation' but added: 'Co-operation with the Hague tribunal is not our number one priority.' Western leaders accept Kostunica's need to shore up his own position before beginnning the sensitive task of dealing with his predecessor, whose influence Kostunica said was waning 'as every minute and hour is ticking away'. He also promised a referendum on the future governance of Montenegro and confirmed his wish to rename it Serbia-Montenegro. EU heads of state took a 'softly softly' approach on the Milosevic question yesterday, with Tony Blair insisting the aim of the meeting was to 'extend the hand of partnership and friendship to the new president and the Serbian people.' He added there was now a chance of a new beginning: 'That the new President of Serbia is coming today to a European Council is a huge signal of progress in the Balkans and throughout the entirety of Europe.' But foreign secretary Robin Cook added the EU would expect the new regime in Serbia 'to fulfil its international obligations'. Kostunica left Belgrade as talks with the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), still led by Milosevic, were scheduled to resume to complete plans for a transitional government for Serbia before new elections, which are expected to be held on 24 December. The fact that Kostunica felt able to travel to Biarritz indicated his growing confidence that there was now no chance of the former President's forces making a comeback.

They tortured and shot him, then dumped his body.</p> <p>On Wednesday they buried Lieberman, and by the time the settlers burnt the mosque, two young Palestinian men were also dead: Mahar Ismail, aged 20, and Natheer Naif, 22, from the village of Jammain.</p> <p>So it goes: the terrifying and disproportionate cycle of violence between Arab and Jew in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. After a fortnight of clashes that have seen more than 100 die - the majority stone-throwing Palestinian youths cut down by Israeli soldiers - a calculus of Old Testament vengeance is being drawn up by the extremists of both sides. A mosque for a shrine is what it demands. A life for a life.</p> <p>The tensions laid bare in Nablus and its outlying communities - both Jewish settler and Palestinian - reveal in microcosm the fracture lines that are threatening to rip apart the peace process and plunge the region into war.</p> <p>For the events of the past two weeks beg Basil Odeh's bleak but simple question: can, after all the years of promised peace talks, of wrangling and negotiation, the people of the West Bank and Gaza and their cousins, the Israeli Arabs, ever co-exist with the Jews of Israel?</p> <p>Seven years after the Oslo Peace Accord - and two years after the agreement at Wye Valley that saw the PLO remove the promise from its covenant to destroy the State of Israel - the prospect of peace looks more distant now than ever. And in Nablus the communities are on the verge of guerrilla war.</p> <p>An hour after visiting the mosque of Houwara al Kabir we trudged through the dust of Jammain village a few kilometres away as the corpses of Mahar Ismail and Natheer Naif were carried amid a crowd of several thousand to the cemetery.</p> <p>'Mahar was bending down to pick up olives,' says one of his friends pointing towards the groves where Mahar died. 'Perhaps the Israelis thought he was picking up a stone.'</p> <p>Or perhaps the soldiers who killed them believed the men were among Palestinians who that afternoon had fired on the funeral procession of Rabbi Hillel Lieber man from among these trees.</p> <p>What is beyond dispute is that in the past few days both sides have been organising into their own militias. In a dangerous development that is being repeated across the Palestinian Territories, a chilling new expression is coming into currency inspired by the experience of Israel's northern neighbour in its long civil war. 'Lebanonisation' is the slow, vicious fracturing of society into militias under the pressure of sectarian violence.</p> <p>'You know, I think the Palestinians in general are not killers,' my companion says as we walk beside the corpses being carried shoulder high among the chanting of Hizbollah slogans. He is a middle-class professional Palestinian who speaks good English, declining to give his name. 'But we are fighting for our lives. It is clear that the Israelis are not prepared to give us anything. They want to treat all Arabs as slaves and second-class citizens. And under attack we have the right to defend ourselves. We have to have militias. We have to gather arms where we can find them.'</p> <p>The promise of a comprehensive Middle East peace was contracting last week into two closed worlds, implacable in their hostility to one another. The efforts of the international community, and of the Palestinian and Israeli leaders, to bring the peace process back on track will come to nothing if they cannot carry their increasingly distrustful communities.</p> <p>Now it is the very polarisation of the two communities that appears to be driving the political process itself. On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been forced to accommodate his right-wing Likud opponent Ariel Sharon, whose visit to the Haram al Sharif mosque two weeks ago triggered the killing, by offering a place in a 'unity' administration. Pressure on Yasser Arafat has seen him free Hamas militants from detention.</p> <p>On Thursday the latest multiplier in the escalating crisis was the 'lynching' of two young Israeli reservists in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Arrested as they lost their way, they were murdered by a mob who entered a police station and - unhindered by policemen of the Palestinian authority - stabbed, shot, kicked and burnt to death.</p> <p>Israel's response - firing missiles into the town centre - was swift and out of proportion.</p> <p>The two closing worlds are crucially different in important aspects. The world of the settlers and their right-wing Jewish allies is self-interested, exclusive and driven by a religious and ideological extremism that refuses to accept that Palestinians and Israeli Arabs have any right to their own land, regardless of the commitments that Israel has signed.</p> <p>On the side of the young Palestinian and Israeli Arab rock throwers of the shabab - and the gunmen emerging to support them - the alienation is driven by the harsh reality of day-to-day existence and half a century of discrimination in their own land.</p> <p>Critical in undermining the peace process on the Palestinian side has been its failure to improve the lives of ordinary Palestinians. Since Oslo, as the Palestinian commentator Edward Said points out in his new collection of essays on the peace process, unemployment among Palestinians has risen dramatically. Gross domestic product has been halved and movement from one side of Palestine to the other (guaranteed under the Wye Valley agreement) is as difficult as ever.</p> <p>It is not all the Israelis' fault. The corruption and incompetence of the Arafat regime in the Palestinian-administered areas, as Said points out, has exacerbated the hardship of Palestinians.</p> <p>But for all the failings of the Arafat administration, the central responsibilty for the Palestinians' problems rests with Israel's failure to abide by the Oslo and Wye agreements over free movement of people within the Palestinian Territories, and its failure to curb settlement building that continues to deepen already appalling social and economic problems. These disappointments at the lack of the fruits of peace were the backdrop to attempts to settle the final status for a putative Palestinian State. It was the stalled issue of the future of Arab east Jerusalem as capital of that state that sparked the latest wave of violence and which remains non-negotiable for Barak.</p> <p>For, if the peace process is failing, it is failing on the central assumption of its US and European backers: that as the peace process raised the quality of Palestinian life, the hardest issues of final status would become more manageable. In seven years, it is the reverse that has become the case.</p> <p>These are the complaints rehearsed by the men gathered at Nablus's burned mosque.</p> <p>'Do I believe the peace negotiations have a future?' asks Tael Farraj. 'The answer is no. The Israelis do not want to give us anything. We are getting nothing from the peace process. We know now that there is only one answer and that is an independent Palestinian State with its capital in Jerusalem.'</p> <p>Nor is this sense of disappointment with the peace process unique to the Palestinian Territories. If anything has shocked ordinary Israelis in the past two weeks, it has been the common cause made by so many of their Israeli Arab neighbours with the Palestinian rioters.</p> <p>'The fact is,' says Nabila Espanioly, human rights director of the Al Tafula centre in Nazareth, 'that the situation of Arabs in Israel is that we are second-class citizens in every respect - in education, housing, health and infrastructure. Those Palestinians among us who were made Israeli citizens in 1966 by virtue of where we lived, are discriminated against in every aspect.</p> <p>What is most shocking is revealed in the social-economic scales for all villages and towns which are graded from one to 10 on quality of life.</p> <p>'All Arab villages - save one - are below the fourth scale. The first scale is exclusively Arab. There is not a single Jewish village.'</p> <p>In the current climate of fear Espanioly's work on Palestinian and Arab Israeli human rights has marked her out for right-wing Jews as worthy of anonymous death threats. 'It is so depressing. I have spent my whole life working with Jewish peace campaigners to try and build something between us.'</p> <p>And it is a sign of the tensions between the two communities that even a woman like Espanioly, who has spent years working for peace, cannot unequivocally condemn the mob that murdered the two soldiers in Ramallah. 'It was very bad. Very bad. And I condemn their killing. But Israeli soldiers have killed over 100 Palestinians. That is why a group of people lost control.'</p> <p>She paused. 'I'm going to cry now... you build and build and build and then... this takes us back years.'</p> <p>At Eilan Moreh, the settlement home of the murdered Rabbi Lieberman near Nablus, the troubles of the Palestinians, whose land they have taken, is the last thing on the Jewish settlers' minds. 'I don't care what happens to the Palestinians,' says Sara Gelbard, a 36-year-old religious Jew from London who moved to Israel at 18.</p> <p>'It is not my problem. I don't think there is a peace process. It has been blown up by the Arabs. The diplomatic efforts to save it are just upsetting people here. It is going to happen: we are moving towards war. We are ready. We are prepared to be shut up in our homes for the few days until it is over. God will give us a miracle again, like 1967.'</p> <p>Gelbard's voice is moderate within the settler communities. 'They are cowards all of them. The Arabs, even our own soldiers,' says Rosalie Lasher, an ageing American Jew. 'I was a volunteer in 1967 but I have never known a problem like we have now. I have never known the Israeli Arabs want to fight. It is because we have given them more and more. But we have our own groups. Radical groups. Our young people will protect us.'</p> <p>\u0095 <b>Chronology</b></p> <p><b>28 September: Sharon sets off an explosion</b><br></p> <p>A visit by Israeli right-wing opposition leader Ariel Sharon to Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque compound, Islam's third holiest shrine, sparks the spiral of violence.</p> <p><b> 30 September: Death that shocked the world</b><br></p> <p>A terrified Mohammed al-Durrah, aged 12, shelters beneath his father's arm from crossfire in Netzarim Junction.

On the side of the young Palestinian and Israeli Arab rock throwers of the shabab - and the gunmen emerging to support them - the alienation is driven by the harsh reality of day-to-day existence and half a century of discrimination in their own land. Critical in undermining the peace process on the Palestinian side has been its failure to improve the lives of ordinary Palestinians. Since Oslo, as the Palestinian commentator Edward Said points out in his new collection of essays on the peace process, unemployment among Palestinians has risen dramatically. Gross domestic product has been halved and movement from one side of Palestine to the other (guaranteed under the Wye Valley agreement) is as difficult as ever. It is not all the Israelis' fault. The corruption and incompetence of the Arafat regime in the Palestinian-administered areas, as Said points out, has exacerbated the hardship of Palestinians. But for all the failings of the Arafat administration, the central responsibilty for the Palestinians' problems rests with Israel's failure to abide by the Oslo and Wye agreements over free movement of people within the Palestinian Territories, and its failure to curb settlement building that continues to deepen already appalling social and economic problems. These disappointments at the lack of the fruits of peace were the backdrop to attempts to settle the final status for a putative Palestinian State. It was the stalled issue of the future of Arab east Jerusalem as capital of that state that sparked the latest wave of violence and which remains non-negotiable for Barak. For, if the peace process is failing, it is failing on the central assumption of its US and European backers: that as the peace process raised the quality of Palestinian life, the hardest issues of final status would become more manageable. In seven years, it is the reverse that has become the case. These are the complaints rehearsed by the men gathered at Nablus's burned mosque. 'Do I believe the peace negotiations have a future?' asks Tael Farraj. 'The answer is no. The Israelis do not want to give us anything. We are getting nothing from the peace process. We know now that there is only one answer and that is an independent Palestinian State with its capital in Jerusalem.' Nor is this sense of disappointment with the peace process unique to the Palestinian Territories. If anything has shocked ordinary Israelis in the past two weeks, it has been the common cause made by so many of their Israeli Arab neighbours with the Palestinian rioters. 'The fact is,' says Nabila Espanioly, human rights director of the Al Tafula centre in Nazareth, 'that the situation of Arabs in Israel is that we are second-class citizens in every respect - in education, housing, health and infrastructure. Those Palestinians among us who were made Israeli citizens in 1966 by virtue of where we lived, are discriminated against in every aspect. What is most shocking is revealed in the social-economic scales for all villages and towns which are graded from one to 10 on quality of life. 'All Arab villages - save one - are below the fourth scale. The first scale is exclusively Arab. There is not a single Jewish village.' In the current climate of fear Espanioly's work on Palestinian and Arab Israeli human rights has marked her out for right-wing Jews as worthy of anonymous death threats. 'It is so depressing. I have spent my whole life working with Jewish peace campaigners to try and build something between us.' And it is a sign of the tensions between the two communities that even a woman like Espanioly, who has spent years working for peace, cannot unequivocally condemn the mob that murdered the two soldiers in Ramallah. 'It was very bad. Very bad. And I condemn their killing. But Israeli soldiers have killed over 100 Palestinians. That is why a group of people lost control.' She paused. 'I'm going to cry now... you build and build and build and then... this takes us back years.' At Eilan Moreh, the settlement home of the murdered Rabbi Lieberman near Nablus, the troubles of the Palestinians, whose land they have taken, is the last thing on the Jewish settlers' minds. 'I don't care what happens to the Palestinians,' says Sara Gelbard, a 36-year-old religious Jew from London who moved to Israel at 18. 'It is not my problem. I don't think there is a peace process. It has been blown up by the Arabs. The diplomatic efforts to save it are just upsetting people here. It is going to happen: we are moving towards war. We are ready. We are prepared to be shut up in our homes for the few days until it is over. God will give us a miracle again, like 1967.' Gelbard's voice is moderate within the settler communities. 'They are cowards all of them. The Arabs, even our own soldiers,' says Rosalie Lasher, an ageing American Jew. 'I was a volunteer in 1967 but I have never known a problem like we have now. I have never known the Israeli Arabs want to fight. It is because we have given them more and more. But we have our own groups. Radical groups. Our young people will protect us.' \u0095 Chronology 28 September: Sharon sets off an explosion A visit by Israeli right-wing opposition leader Ariel Sharon to Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque compound, Islam's third holiest shrine, sparks the spiral of violence. 30 September: Death that shocked the world A terrified Mohammed al-Durrah, aged 12, shelters beneath his father's arm from crossfire in Netzarim Junction. Moments later, the boy lay dead. 5 October: Leaders meet to halt the bloodshed Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, right, and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, left, agree in talks in Paris with world leaders on steps to halt the escalating conflict. 10 October: Arafat blasts Israeli deadline A Palestinian boy hurls stones at soldiers in Rafah after Yasser Arafat derided as an empty gesture Israel's decision to extend its deadline for him to halt the violence. 12 October: The bloody hands of death A youth displays his hands stained with the blood of two Israeli soliders killed by fellow protesters in a frenzied attack at a Palestinian police station in Ramallah. 12 October: Israelis send in the gunships An Israeli army helicopter fires missiles towards targets in the centre of Ramallah in retaliation for the mob killing of the two soldiers at the police station. 12 October: Direct hit signals Israeli resolve A police station in Ramallah, the West Bank town that has come to symbolise the escalating violence engulfing the region, is smashed to rubble by an Israeli missile. 12 October: UN tries to avert catastrophe ... Secretary-General Kofi Annan flew straight to Israel on being told of Israeli rocket strikes on Ramallah, in retaliation for the brutal murders of Israeli soldiers there. 13 October : ... but the bloodshed continues Shot in the head by a rubber-coated bullet, a Palestinian protester is carried away during a battle with Israeli troops at Hebron on the West Bank. 13 October: Staring destruction in the face An Israeli policeman and a Palestinian scream hatred at each other over the right for Muslims to pray in the Old City of Jerusalem as tensions reach flashpoint. \u0095 The rocky road to war and peace - and back again 1948 : Israel founded.

Party sources revealed that Jack McConnell, the finance minister, intends to stand for the leadership, resisting pressure for him to allow enterprise minister Henry McLeish to be elected unopposed. McConnell, 40, has refused to reveal whether he will stand because he feels that the focus should be on mourning Dewar's death from a brain haemorrhage on Wednesday, which left Scotland deeply shocked. But The Observer understands that McConnell will announce on Thursday or Friday that he will run against McLeish. Dewar will be buried in a private ceremony on Wednesday after a public service at Glasgow Cathedral. 'Jack is not going to say anything until after Donald's funeral, but he is going to stand,' one insider said last night.

With speculation about the late first minister's successor threatening to spin out of control, the Labour leadership in Scotland revealed yesterday that an interim leader will be elected by secret ballot at an executive meeting in Stirling on Saturday. Under party rules, the leader is selected by an electoral college of MSPs, trade unions and individual members. But the 28-day deadline written into the Scotland Act by Dewar for selecting a new first minister has forced the party to speed up the process. Lesley Quinn, the party's Scottish general secretary, promised yesterday that the full electoral college would be used later to elect the leader, although the hope must be that the interim leader would go forward unopposed. The post of deputy leader, never filled by Dewar because he did not want to anoint a successor, will also be elected by the full electoral college. The decision to adopt the truncated procedures indicates that Labour is desperate to avoid allegations of a backroom stitch-up in the selection of Dewar's successor. To the fury of senior Labour figures at Holyrood, it was suggested - with prompting from London - that McLeish be handed the job of leader to avoid the need for a time-consuming and divisive succession battle. McConnell will be taking a major gamble if he stands. The former Scottish general secretary has come under intense pressure to back off and give McLeish a free run and, by standing, he risks creating deep divisions within the party.

But his supporters believe that he will have a far stronger chance of success under the new process - the electorate will be made up of 54 MSPs and 27 members of the Scottish executive - than the full electoral college. They hope to capitalise on the resentment among MSPs at the McLeish camp's bid to 'bounce' their man into the job, and a backlash against perceived Downing Street interference amid reports that Gordon Brown endorsed McLeish's campaign. The enterprise minister, serving as Labour's senior spokesman in the cabinet until a new leader is elected, is also likely to suffer from accusations that his supporters did not allow a dignified mourning period before they pushed for his election. 'The way the numbers break down, it is wide open,' the insider said. 'But Jack wouldn't be standing if he didn't think he had a serious chance.' Details of the election were released as the Prime Minister's spokesman denied that Blair was taking sides. 'What he wants is people to pay due respect to somebody who was a close personal friend of his and who is also somebody for whom the people of Scotland have massive affection,' Alastair Campbell said. 'The Prime Minister is not a member of the Scottish Labour Party, and the Scottish party will address this in due course.' Asked if the prime minister was wary of interfering after the backlash over the Welsh leadership battle, Campbell said: 'He is leaving it to the Scots, but I do emphasise that even a few years ago if somebody like Donald had died there would be a little bit of breathing space before normal politics resumed. There's not even been a funeral yet. I think people should wait.' Invitations to the rest of the Cabinet to attend the funeral were still being decided, he added. 'The family feel that Donald would not have wanted a massive thing but our sense is that the country would like a really big send off.' Labour is also considering a permanent memorial to the late first minister.",

An independent study by the Advisory Committee on Animal Feeding Stuffs reveals that alien genes used by scientists to modify crops are surviving the manufacturing process which turns GM crops into animal food. The report heightens fears that products such as chicken, turkey, beef and pork may be contaminated with modified genes if the animals they are from were raised on GM feed.

Another concern is that farmworkers inhaling the dust from GM feed could be affected. Environmentalists further fear that humans eating meat or dairy products from livestock fed on GM crops could be at risk, although so far there is no evidence that bacteria in human guts have been affected. However, earlier this year, The Observer revealed the work of a German scientist who had found that genes from GM crops could be found in bacteria in the guts of bees. Fears of this kind led the Government's independent advisory committee - which reports to the Food Standards Agency - to commission the consultants ADAS to monitor the manufacturing of animal feed. The draft minutes of the committee, seen by this newspaper, state: 'The results indicate that DNA fragments large enough to contain potentially functional genes survived processing in many of the samples studied.' Members of the committee had 'expressed surprise that so much DNA survived processing', the minutes add. Greenpeace has called on the Government to take immediate steps to stop the continuing import of GM crops from the US for use in animal feed. A spokesman for the environmental group, Andy Tait, said: 'It is beyond belief that even in the wake of the BSE crisis, independent research into the potential for GM to cross into the guts of animals was not done before these crops were allowed to market.' The GM firm Monsanto has always said the genes used in its soya crops are 'inactivated' by heat processing during animal feed manufacture. Biotech companies argue that Britons have been happily eating and drinking milk, chicken, pork and beef from livestock raised on GM-rich diets since the early Nineties and shown no ill effects.

The agency would go on pressing for the compulsory labelling of food from animals raised on GM feed, she added.

      "bodyText": "Northern Ireland's power-sharing government faces a new crisis after the family of a murdered republican dissident last night claimed the Provisional IRA killed him. The allegation calls into question the Provisionals' ceasefire and puts further pressure on First Minister David Trimble to resign from the Executive with Sinn Fein. The shooting of Real IRA man Joe O'Connor, 26, in West Belfast last Friday could also spark a bloody feud between mainstream republicans and dissidents. The father of three was shot seven times in the head outside his mother's home in Whitecliff Parade, only yards from where his grandfather, Francisco Notarantonio, was killed by loyalists 13 years ago this week. His mother, Margaret O'Connor told The Observer of the minutes leading up to the killing. Two masked gunmen, backed by look-outs with two-way radios at either end to her son's car as he pulled up to visit her. 'One of them put his foot against the door to prevent him getting out. He then fired into the car at Joe. They also tried to shoot my brother, Anthony, who was in the car with my son, but he got away. They fired seven shots into Joe, five in his head and two in his face. 'I know it was the Provisional IRA because up to 20 people said they saw who it was as they took their masks off before getting away. They killed Joe because he would not toe their line and opposed them going into Stormont.' The murdered man's sister, Margaret Lennon, claimed the Provos had tried to shoot O'Connor in a bar on the Poleglass estate in West Belfast the previous week. But when the IRA gang arrived, the dissident had just left. Mrs Lennon said that last March one of her brothers had been abducted and questioned by the IRA over his support for republican dissident groups. The kidnappers hijacked a bus belonging to the Catholic Church to transport her brother to a 'safe house' in the nearby Beechmount area, where he was stripped naked, beaten and questioned about dissident republican activity, she said. Her brother would have keen killed then, but for Real IRA gunmen, who went to IRA supporters' homes in Ballymurphy to demandhis release. She added: 'I heard the shots that killed my brother. At first I thought they were fireworks. Joe was killed because he was a true republican and did not agree with the Provos going into Stormont. He died because he spoke out. If this is the new police force on offer, then God help us.' Mrs O'Connor said her entire family had voted for Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams for almost two decades. Her brother, Victor Notarantonio, added: 'We were always for Adams, but never again.' He criticised claims in some national newspapers that the other dissident group, the Continuity IRA, carried out the murder. 'Everybody in this area knows that is a lie,' he said, 'They [the Provisionals] thought they could get away with this killing. They thought it would be no claim, no blame, that people would think it was the loyalists. But now the people know that the Provisional IRA did this to a fellow republican.' Victor Notarantonio's father was killed in disputed circumstances in 1987 when Ulster Defence Association gunmen entered his home and shot him dead as he slept. Last month the Government attempted to gag newspapers allegations that Francisco Notarantonio was set up by British agents to save a top IRA informer. It is alleged that UDA mole Brian Nelson - an agent for the Army's Force Research Unit - had unwittingly found information about a spy inside the IRA, codenamed Steak Knife.

Ballymurphy is a stronghold for mainstream republicans. But there is a sign of dissent just yards from where O'Connor died.

      "body": "<p>Next Saturday, 81 senior members of the Scottish Labour Party will convene at Viewforth, the baronial-style headquarters of Stirling council. There, in the shadow of Stirling Castle, the 53 MSPs and 27 members of the party's Scottish executive will deal with one item of business: the election of Donald Dewar's successor as party leader and First Minister of Scotland.</p> <p>It is a near certainty that two candidates - Henry McLeish, the Enterprise Minister, and Jack McConnell, the Finance Minister - will be nominated from the floor. But whichever man emerges from that room as the victor, one outcome is guaranteed. The tragic events of last week mean the United Kingdom is about to experience the most profound shift in its constitutional settlement since the Scots voted to establish the Holyrood Parliament in 1997.</p> <p>'Donald's death is going to have a huge impact on the relationship between Edinburgh and London,' said one senior Labour MP at Westminster. 'You would have to be an idiot not to believe it is now a very different game.'</p> <p>At 12.18pm last Wednesday, the moment Dewar was pronounced dead, the whole of the UK, not only Scotland, entered uncharted and perilous constitutional waters. While Dewar was at the helm, the transition to devolved government had been relatively smooth and unthreatening. With his Westminster pedigree and Cabinet big-hitter status, he formed the crucial bridge between the old, unitary UK and the new, devolved system.</p> <p>In Scotland, he was respected as the driving force behind change; in Downing Street, he was trusted as the safe pair of hands to keep that change firmly anchored in the wider Labour vision of Britain. Open conflict between Holyrood and Westminster has been almost non-existent. But with Dewar's passing, the realities of dividing power between two different parliaments will quickly become apparent.</p> <p>For whoever takes over from Dewar will immediately be confronted with the unenviable task of moving the Parliament out from beneath the late First Minister's shadow. To do so, they will almost certainly have to adopt a more nationalistic agenda.</p> <p>According to recent polls, fewer than one in four Scots want independence, while more than half support devolution. But at the same time, the SNP has established a fairly solid lead over Labour when it comes to Holyrood voting intentions. The implication is clear: voters might not want to break up the UK but they want a Scottish Executive ready to rough it up with Downing Street.</p> <p>'The idea that the British state has ever been homogeneous is flawed, but never more so than now,' said James Mitchell, professor of politics at Strathclyde University. 'The real test of devolution was always going to come post-Dewar, and we are now moving into a much more realistic phase for the Scottish Parliament.</p> <p>'Without Dewar, it is going to have to stand up, establish itself and work.'</p> <p>So McLeish or McConnell will have to be prepared to break away from the path dictated by London party policy, a task that may come more naturally to McConnell. He was a founder of the Scottish Labour Action group in the 1980s and represented Labour on the Constitutional Convention. McLeish, by contrast, was a Westminster MP for 13 years, during which time he served as a UK Minister. But even he will want to start thumping a more overtly Scottish tub if he wins. One minefield the new First Minister will almost certainly have to cross involves the question of greater powers for Holyrood, in particular over raising its own finances.</p> <p>More importantly, Dewar's successor will have to be seen to secure a few victories against London. And that may create further problems for Labour in Scotland. There are fears in some quarters that neither man has the stature to take on Downing Street over a major issue of policy and win. 'The relationship between London and Edinburgh is going to be much more fluid,' said Mitchell. 'Dewar was somebody who could go to Blair, if not as an equal, then damn near it, and the loss of somebody who was such a big player on the British field is going to have a serious effect. Dewar was able to smooth things over, and none of the potential candidates is going to be able to do that.'</p> <p>Some leading Labour MSPs agree. One told The Observer : 'Downing Street will be concerned because Tony Blair knew Donald well and so did Gordon Brown. Whatever relationship they have with whoever takes over will not be the same.'</p> <p>All this will make life difficult for Downing Street. The movement of power away from London fits in with Blair's philosophical support for decentralisation. But it runs counter to his centralising instincts that the 'only way to get things done' is for him and his staff to get involved. He has had to learn, from the debacle of Ken Livingstone's successful campaign to be Mayor of London to the mess over Alun Michael in Wales, that devolving power means losing power.</p> <p>In an interview with The Observer in the spring, he admitted that he had to learn to let go.</p> <p>That decision will be tested now. Much like Margaret Thatcher, Blair has never really 'got' Scotland. He left it to the likes of Dewar, one of the few people he felt politically in awe of. Now he no longer has that luxury. 'The best way to describe it is that devolution is a big juggernaut Blair could live with so long as Donald was driving,' said a senior Scottish Labour MP. 'He knew its path would be predictable and it would only really have one gear. But now the fear is the juggernaut will run out of control.'</p> <p>A senior Labour Party figure with close connections to Downing Street said Blair was 'totally relaxed' about leaving the decision to Scotland. Downing Street has poured cold water on claims it intended to parachute in a senior Cabinet figure - names mooted included that of Alistair Darling, the Social Security Secretary, and John Reid, the Scottish Secretary - to take Dewar's old job.</p> <p>The fact is the potential Scottish front-runners do not fill Blair with the dread with which he greeted the news of Livingstone running for London and Rhodri Morgan running for Wales. A Downing Street source said a decision had been taken that Scotland and Wales should be left to their own devices.</p> <p>Many in Scotland are not convinced by these protestations. 'Tony Blair's problem is he doesn't have much understanding of the rest of the UK, which is surprising given that he spent time at school in Edinburgh,' said Mitchell. 'He has devolved institutions, but he still has a unitary state mindset.'</p> <p>Even taking a back seat may turn out to be a dangerous strategy. Blair, if his majority is cut drastically at the next election, will still be relying on Westminster MPs from north of the border to keep him in power. If Labour at Holyrood suffers a meltdown, there would be a knock-on effect on the UK-wide elections.</p> <p>That is why Blair will ensure Gordon Brown has a key role. The Chancellor, who enjoys enormous influence in Scotland, will step in to ensure the handover is smooth. 'Nobody with an English accent in Downing Street will get involved in this, but Brown will still be pulling strings,' said a Scottish MP.</p> <p>The potential pitfalls of this tactic were already emerging within 36 hours of Dewar's death. Supporters of McLeish were spinning that Brown had endorsed their man's bid to be anointed as party leader without a contest in the interests of party unity. The reaction from other Labour politicians and the Scottish media was predictable outrage. Yet again, Downing Street was implicated in a botched attempt to stitch up the contest.</p> <p>But the implications of Dewar's death are not limited to the Executive benches. Three weeks ago, the SNP's own big-hitting frontman, Alex Salmond, stepped aside after 10 years at the helm.</p> <p>The SNP, too, is adjusting to having a new, relatively inexperienced and untested leader in John Swinney.

      "bodyText": "Next Saturday, 81 senior members of the Scottish Labour Party will convene at Viewforth, the baronial-style headquarters of Stirling council. There, in the shadow of Stirling Castle, the 53 MSPs and 27 members of the party's Scottish executive will deal with one item of business: the election of Donald Dewar's successor as party leader and First Minister of Scotland. It is a near certainty that two candidates - Henry McLeish, the Enterprise Minister, and Jack McConnell, the Finance Minister - will be nominated from the floor. But whichever man emerges from that room as the victor, one outcome is guaranteed. The tragic events of last week mean the United Kingdom is about to experience the most profound shift in its constitutional settlement since the Scots voted to establish the Holyrood Parliament in 1997. 'Donald's death is going to have a huge impact on the relationship between Edinburgh and London,' said one senior Labour MP at Westminster. 'You would have to be an idiot not to believe it is now a very different game.' At 12.18pm last Wednesday, the moment Dewar was pronounced dead, the whole of the UK, not only Scotland, entered uncharted and perilous constitutional waters. While Dewar was at the helm, the transition to devolved government had been relatively smooth and unthreatening. With his Westminster pedigree and Cabinet big-hitter status, he formed the crucial bridge between the old, unitary UK and the new, devolved system. In Scotland, he was respected as the driving force behind change; in Downing Street, he was trusted as the safe pair of hands to keep that change firmly anchored in the wider Labour vision of Britain. Open conflict between Holyrood and Westminster has been almost non-existent. But with Dewar's passing, the realities of dividing power between two different parliaments will quickly become apparent. For whoever takes over from Dewar will immediately be confronted with the unenviable task of moving the Parliament out from beneath the late First Minister's shadow. To do so, they will almost certainly have to adopt a more nationalistic agenda. According to recent polls, fewer than one in four Scots want independence, while more than half support devolution. But at the same time, the SNP has established a fairly solid lead over Labour when it comes to Holyrood voting intentions. The implication is clear: voters might not want to break up the UK but they want a Scottish Executive ready to rough it up with Downing Street. 'The idea that the British state has ever been homogeneous is flawed, but never more so than now,' said James Mitchell, professor of politics at Strathclyde University. 'The real test of devolution was always going to come post-Dewar, and we are now moving into a much more realistic phase for the Scottish Parliament. 'Without Dewar, it is going to have to stand up, establish itself and work.' So McLeish or McConnell will have to be prepared to break away from the path dictated by London party policy, a task that may come more naturally to McConnell. He was a founder of the Scottish Labour Action group in the 1980s and represented Labour on the Constitutional Convention. McLeish, by contrast, was a Westminster MP for 13 years, during which time he served as a UK Minister. But even he will want to start thumping a more overtly Scottish tub if he wins. One minefield the new First Minister will almost certainly have to cross involves the question of greater powers for Holyrood, in particular over raising its own finances. More importantly, Dewar's successor will have to be seen to secure a few victories against London. And that may create further problems for Labour in Scotland. There are fears in some quarters that neither man has the stature to take on Downing Street over a major issue of policy and win. 'The relationship between London and Edinburgh is going to be much more fluid,' said Mitchell. 'Dewar was somebody who could go to Blair, if not as an equal, then damn near it, and the loss of somebody who was such a big player on the British field is going to have a serious effect. Dewar was able to smooth things over, and none of the potential candidates is going to be able to do that.' Some leading Labour MSPs agree. One told The Observer : 'Downing Street will be concerned because Tony Blair knew Donald well and so did Gordon Brown. Whatever relationship they have with whoever takes over will not be the same.' All this will make life difficult for Downing Street. The movement of power away from London fits in with Blair's philosophical support for decentralisation. But it runs counter to his centralising instincts that the 'only way to get things done' is for him and his staff to get involved. He has had to learn, from the debacle of Ken Livingstone's successful campaign to be Mayor of London to the mess over Alun Michael in Wales, that devolving power means losing power. In an interview with The Observer in the spring, he admitted that he had to learn to let go. That decision will be tested now. Much like Margaret Thatcher, Blair has never really 'got' Scotland. He left it to the likes of Dewar, one of the few people he felt politically in awe of. Now he no longer has that luxury. 'The best way to describe it is that devolution is a big juggernaut Blair could live with so long as Donald was driving,' said a senior Scottish Labour MP. 'He knew its path would be predictable and it would only really have one gear. But now the fear is the juggernaut will run out of control.' A senior Labour Party figure with close connections to Downing Street said Blair was 'totally relaxed' about leaving the decision to Scotland. Downing Street has poured cold water on claims it intended to parachute in a senior Cabinet figure - names mooted included that of Alistair Darling, the Social Security Secretary, and John Reid, the Scottish Secretary - to take Dewar's old job. The fact is the potential Scottish front-runners do not fill Blair with the dread with which he greeted the news of Livingstone running for London and Rhodri Morgan running for Wales. A Downing Street source said a decision had been taken that Scotland and Wales should be left to their own devices. Many in Scotland are not convinced by these protestations. 'Tony Blair's problem is he doesn't have much understanding of the rest of the UK, which is surprising given that he spent time at school in Edinburgh,' said Mitchell. 'He has devolved institutions, but he still has a unitary state mindset.' Even taking a back seat may turn out to be a dangerous strategy. Blair, if his majority is cut drastically at the next election, will still be relying on Westminster MPs from north of the border to keep him in power. If Labour at Holyrood suffers a meltdown, there would be a knock-on effect on the UK-wide elections. That is why Blair will ensure Gordon Brown has a key role. The Chancellor, who enjoys enormous influence in Scotland, will step in to ensure the handover is smooth. 'Nobody with an English accent in Downing Street will get involved in this, but Brown will still be pulling strings,' said a Scottish MP. The potential pitfalls of this tactic were already emerging within 36 hours of Dewar's death. Supporters of McLeish were spinning that Brown had endorsed their man's bid to be anointed as party leader without a contest in the interests of party unity. The reaction from other Labour politicians and the Scottish media was predictable outrage. Yet again, Downing Street was implicated in a botched attempt to stitch up the contest. But the implications of Dewar's death are not limited to the Executive benches. Three weeks ago, the SNP's own big-hitting frontman, Alex Salmond, stepped aside after 10 years at the helm. The SNP, too, is adjusting to having a new, relatively inexperienced and untested leader in John Swinney. 'We used to have two real heavyweights slugging it out,' one MSP said last week. 'Now it is going to be two featherweights.' And if the new First Minister does pull off a few victories against London, the nationalists may well see their opinion poll leads evaporate. 'It is just too early to say what sort of effect this will have on the Parliament and on our strategy,' said Swinney, who was able to take on Dewar at question time only once since being installed as leader. 'Obviously, I had not expected to be facing a new Labour leader this quickly, although I thought there was a possibility there would be a new one by the time of the Scottish general election in 2004. The one thing I would say is that political culture is shaped by people and the way people interrelate within institutions.' In the next few months, Scotland and the rest of the UK will find out how deep that change will run.",

The 8,600-ton ship is the length of a football field and carries long-range cruise missiles and air-defence weapons. Not long after its unannounced arrival at 8.45am, it was surrounded by vessels involved in mooring, refuelling and waste removal. Another small boat approached from across the harbour, a motorised rubber dinghy. Witnesses saw two men standing in it, as if in salute. Seconds later they died as an explosion blew a 40ft by 40ft hole in the Cole, killing 17 American sailors and injuring 37. The attack was the latest example of what defence experts call 'asymmetrical warfare' where instead of fighting the mighty US on its own terms, its enemies have gone for its Achilles' heel. Their weapons are harbour boats and truck-bombs, their targets military compounds and support facilities. The terrorists who found the Cole's weakness had advance knowledge of the ship's stop in Aden and an intimate understanding of refuelling procedures. Yemen has been seriously embarrassed by the attack, and annoyed the US by claiming it was an accident. Security in the port area is not particularly tight. It is likely the suicide bombers were employed somewhere in the port area and could have obtained jobs there specifically to carry out the attack. In any case, the operation would have taken some time to prepare - which suggests that it was anti-American and not specifically connected to the current Israeli-Palestinian situation. The attackers could have received advance warning of the warship's arrival from within the port, though it is equally possible that they got the information about its movements from watching shipping elsewhere. FBI agents arrived in Aden yesterday to investigate the deadliest attack on the US military since the 1996 bombing of Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia that killed 19. Last week an organisation calling itself the Army of Mohammed - an extremist group previously known to be active only in Chechnya and Dagestan - claimed responsibility for the attacks on the Cole and on the British embassy in the Yemen capital of Sana'a, about 200 miles from Aden, on Friday.

      "body": "<p>At the height of the fuel crisis, Margaret Beckett denounced that part of conservative Britain which tolerated elections only when they brought victories to the Right. 'There is a group of people in this country who passionately believe... that there is something terribly, terribly wrong about having a Labour government,' she said. 'Labour ought never to be in power and if we are we ought to fail.' She was ridiculed as a barking conspiracy theorist by those who forgot the plots of MI5, retired colonels and Napoleonic tycoons against the Wilson administrations, but not by those who have been keeping an eye on the Countryside Alliance.</p> <p>The Alliance's fight to save hunting is no longer being waged with vaguely rational arguments. Enter its collective mind and you are in a war of national liberation against an alien and depraved dictatorship. If you think I'm exaggerating, ask how Sam Butler, the Alliance's chairman, could bellow without a blush to a demonstration outside the Labour Party Conference: 'Our forefathers didn't fight Hitler to have this lot take away our liberties.' One of Butler's forefathers was 'Rab' Butler. He didn't fight Hitler, he appeased him throughout the Thirties and then aided Lord Halifax's manoeuvres to force Churchill to come to terms with the Nazi in 1940. His grandson cannot spot the difference between a Government which is reluctantly allowing a free vote on hunting in response to overwhelming public and backbench pressure, and a totalitarian invader.</p> <p>Because Parliament will sooner or later ban hunting with dogs, the MPs who support the new Hitler must be presented as human filth; unnatural and unEnglish politicians who have forfeited the right to legislate.</p> <p>The magazine Earth Dog, Running Dog, for example, which carries the Countryside Alliance's logo, said of Ben Bradshaw, the gay Labour MP for Exeter: 'Fortunately most people are still totally revolted by such lifestyles. Let us not forget the money the health service is forced to spend on the treatment of Aids - the gay plague.<i>Do we really deserve to have such people rule us and tell us what to do ?'</i> Bradshaw's black colleague, Oona King, meanwhile was 'typical of her species'. She was told to 'direct her talents to advising her scrounging supporters on how to claim more handouts [the editorialist means the London poor King represents, not farmers]. <i>She has no right to interfere in my life or anybody else's, apart from the deadbeats who helped send her to Parliament.'</i> Butler has told his troops that the Government's record was one of 'terrorists released, rioters allowed to roam the streets wreaking havoc and destruction, whilst the authorities look on'. The Alliance 'has made it clear to Parliament and public alike that we have been resolute in our determination to conduct our protests within the law.<i> However, should Parliament act perversely on the issue of personal freedom, then it will only have itself to blame for what may follow.'</i> (My italics throughout).</p> <p>As you can see, the anti-hunting campaign isn't only about hunting. The Alliance is a porte-manteau stuffed with every rage against women, gays, blacks, the poor, the Good Friday Agreement ... a damnable modern world turned upside down.</p> <p>Butler's prediction that hunters will take the law into their own hands if the deviants in Parliament 'act perversely' is already being realised. The provisional wing of the Countryside Alliance is the Rural Action Group. It affects an air of conspiratorial secrecy, while neglecting to take elementary precautions to protect its emails. The most recent warns of the need to 'keep quiet' about its plans for tractor and Land Rover owners to blockade Parliament Square (on 23 October, traffic wardens should note).</p> <p>If this sounds like an imitation of the tactics of the flying fuel pickets, then the resemblance may be more than coincidental. You do not have to go all the way with Beckett's notion that the oil refinery protests were a plot to be struck by the overlap between the demonstrators, the Countryside Alliance and the Conservative Party. Protesters' cars at the Stanlow oil refinery bore Alliance stickers. Where Tony Blair was confronted with demonstrators in Hull they carried banners crying 'No Hunting, No Petrol'. Liberal commentators responded by dissecting the hypocrisy of supportive Conservative politicians and newspapers who usually demand punitive sanctions against greedy strikers 'holding the country ransom'. But in truth their double-standard charge cut both ways. If Lefties believe urban workers are entitled to take action to protect their livelihoods, how can they criticise farmers suffering in the wors agricultural depression since the Thirties for following suit?</p> <p>Honest critics would be forced to hold their tongues if the Alliance and its fellow travellers represented the countryside. Predictably, they do nothing of the sort. Sam Butler isn't a persecuted yeoman, but a millionaire estate agent who has made his fortune by selling Cotswold property to the commuters and second-home owners who price the local peasantry out of the market. Britain's biggest builders - Robert McAlpine, Sunley Holdings, Persimmon Homes - are among his backers. So too is the Duke of Devonshire who wants to bring open-cast mining to his Derbyshire estate. These are 'countrymen' who are 'for field sports, not fields', as the International Fund for Animal Welfare neatly put it.</p> <p>They are also the Tory party on horseback. The Alliance offices are filled with ex-Conservative officials and MPs who lost their jobs in the 1997 massacre. Conservative councillors joined the refinery picket lines. My guess is that the Government's attempts to strike a deal with fuel blockaders before their deadline runs out in 28 days will be futile. Their Tory wing may find it hard to see the political mileage in compromise.</p> <p>The losers from the hijacking of rural grievance by the estate agents and developers are poor farmers. The best hope for an agricultural industry being crucified by a high pound is early entry to the European monetary union. The Alliance will no more support scrapping the pound than gay marriage or a windfall tax on the oil cartel.</p> <p>Hunters themselves have respectable arguments against the faux humanitarianism of prohibiting hunting with dogs but not with guns. They might ask that if the language of socialism is the language of priorities, what seriously radical Labour Party would waste a moment on fox hunting after 18 years in opposition? They could, and indeed have, concluded that their opponents are more concerned with persecuting hunters than saving foxes.</p> <p>For all that, the reasons to tolerate hunting have been destroyed by the hunting lobby. Any civilised person who has gaped at its bigotry can only shrug and mutter: all persecution is fine by me.</p> <p>\u0095 <b>And the biggest criminal is ... the governor, apparently</b></p> <p>As our politicians are meant to be eager to save us from crime, you might have thought that a prison governor who managed to turn criminals into law-abiding citizens would be f\u00eated.</p> <p>Yet Eoin McLellan-Murray, the governor of Blantyre House, was loathed. He ran a prison with the lowest number of positive drug tests of any jail in Britain. It didn't help him.</p> <p>Just 8 per cent of his inmates reoffended on release. The achievement served only to goad his enemies. In April they organised a raid by 80 officers dressed as if they were a Swat team breaking up a terrorist cell. McLellan-Murray was suspended and his jail was ransacked.</p> <p>His offence was to run a liberal prison which prepared inmates for release by letting them work for Kent employers and charities.</p> <p>Given the jail's success, reasons had to be found for destroying its regime. Martin Narey, the Director General of the Prison Service, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee in May that he had confidential intelligence of villainy in the jail which he couldn't discuss for fear of prejudicing criminal investigations. Kent Police said there were no criminal investigations.</p> <p>His officers had uncovered stolen goods and escape equipment as they tore through the cells, Narey continued. He did not tell MPs that 'stolen' bank cards were the legally held property of working prisoners and the escape equipment was the tools of a prisoner who was repairing a Mencap charity shop.</p> <p>This week the Home Affairs Committee will call Narey back to explain himself. Understandably, he has asked to give his evidence in secret. I hope the MPs will turn him down and ask why they were spun dark tales of criminal conspiracy and contraband which cannot be substantiated.</p> <p>They should also inquire about the fate of the governor. Since the biggest raid in the recent history of the Prison Service failed to find anything McLellan-Murray need be ashamed of, he has been subjected to months of interrogation by Home Office hardliners desperate to find a justification for zero tolerance reduced to absurdity.</p> <p>Last week, they gave us their best shot. Harry Fletcher, the spokesman for the probation officers union, reports McLellan-Murray will face disciplinary charges of failing to account for the purchase of a gas cylinder worth \u00a3110, two electric sockets priced at \u00a38.56 and a \u00a3500 donation to the mentally ill from the prison's charitable funds.</p> <p>He is not being accused of pocketing the money. It is merely that he or one of his subordinates didn't fill out the right forms when they dealt with the paperwork. For these terrible sins, one of the finest public servants in the Home Office will see his career wrecked while Narey's flourishes. 'Scandal' is an overused word by hacks, but in this instance no other will do.</p>",

The Alliance 'has made it clear to Parliament and public alike that we have been resolute in our determination to conduct our protests within the law. However, should Parliament act perversely on the issue of personal freedom, then it will only have itself to blame for what may follow.' (My italics throughout). As you can see, the anti-hunting campaign isn't only about hunting. The Alliance is a porte-manteau stuffed with every rage against women, gays, blacks, the poor, the Good Friday Agreement ... a damnable modern world turned upside down. Butler's prediction that hunters will take the law into their own hands if the deviants in Parliament 'act perversely' is already being realised. The provisional wing of the Countryside Alliance is the Rural Action Group. It affects an air of conspiratorial secrecy, while neglecting to take elementary precautions to protect its emails. The most recent warns of the need to 'keep quiet' about its plans for tractor and Land Rover owners to blockade Parliament Square (on 23 October, traffic wardens should note). If this sounds like an imitation of the tactics of the flying fuel pickets, then the resemblance may be more than coincidental. You do not have to go all the way with Beckett's notion that the oil refinery protests were a plot to be struck by the overlap between the demonstrators, the Countryside Alliance and the Conservative Party. Protesters' cars at the Stanlow oil refinery bore Alliance stickers. Where Tony Blair was confronted with demonstrators in Hull they carried banners crying 'No Hunting, No Petrol'. Liberal commentators responded by dissecting the hypocrisy of supportive Conservative politicians and newspapers who usually demand punitive sanctions against greedy strikers 'holding the country ransom'. But in truth their double-standard charge cut both ways. If Lefties believe urban workers are entitled to take action to protect their livelihoods, how can they criticise farmers suffering in the wors agricultural depression since the Thirties for following suit? Honest critics would be forced to hold their tongues if the Alliance and its fellow travellers represented the countryside. Predictably, they do nothing of the sort. Sam Butler isn't a persecuted yeoman, but a millionaire estate agent who has made his fortune by selling Cotswold property to the commuters and second-home owners who price the local peasantry out of the market. Britain's biggest builders - Robert McAlpine, Sunley Holdings, Persimmon Homes - are among his backers. So too is the Duke of Devonshire who wants to bring open-cast mining to his Derbyshire estate. These are 'countrymen' who are 'for field sports, not fields', as the International Fund for Animal Welfare neatly put it. They are also the Tory party on horseback. The Alliance offices are filled with ex-Conservative officials and MPs who lost their jobs in the 1997 massacre. Conservative councillors joined the refinery picket lines. My guess is that the Government's attempts to strike a deal with fuel blockaders before their deadline runs out in 28 days will be futile. Their Tory wing may find it hard to see the political mileage in compromise. The losers from the hijacking of rural grievance by the estate agents and developers are poor farmers. The best hope for an agricultural industry being crucified by a high pound is early entry to the European monetary union. The Alliance will no more support scrapping the pound than gay marriage or a windfall tax on the oil cartel. Hunters themselves have respectable arguments against the faux humanitarianism of prohibiting hunting with dogs but not with guns. They might ask that if the language of socialism is the language of priorities, what seriously radical Labour Party would waste a moment on fox hunting after 18 years in opposition? They could, and indeed have, concluded that their opponents are more concerned with persecuting hunters than saving foxes. For all that, the reasons to tolerate hunting have been destroyed by the hunting lobby. Any civilised person who has gaped at its bigotry can only shrug and mutter: all persecution is fine by me. \u0095 And the biggest criminal is ... the governor, apparently As our politicians are meant to be eager to save us from crime, you might have thought that a prison governor who managed to turn criminals into law-abiding citizens would be f\u00eated. Yet Eoin McLellan-Murray, the governor of Blantyre House, was loathed. He ran a prison with the lowest number of positive drug tests of any jail in Britain. It didn't help him. Just 8 per cent of his inmates reoffended on release. The achievement served only to goad his enemies. In April they organised a raid by 80 officers dressed as if they were a Swat team breaking up a terrorist cell. McLellan-Murray was suspended and his jail was ransacked. His offence was to run a liberal prison which prepared inmates for release by letting them work for Kent employers and charities. Given the jail's success, reasons had to be found for destroying its regime. Martin Narey, the Director General of the Prison Service, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee in May that he had confidential intelligence of villainy in the jail which he couldn't discuss for fear of prejudicing criminal investigations. Kent Police said there were no criminal investigations. His officers had uncovered stolen goods and escape equipment as they tore through the cells, Narey continued. He did not tell MPs that 'stolen' bank cards were the legally held property of working prisoners and the escape equipment was the tools of a prisoner who was repairing a Mencap charity shop. This week the Home Affairs Committee will call Narey back to explain himself. Understandably, he has asked to give his evidence in secret. I hope the MPs will turn him down and ask why they were spun dark tales of criminal conspiracy and contraband which cannot be substantiated. They should also inquire about the fate of the governor. Since the biggest raid in the recent history of the Prison Service failed to find anything McLellan-Murray need be ashamed of, he has been subjected to months of interrogation by Home Office hardliners desperate to find a justification for zero tolerance reduced to absurdity. Last week, they gave us their best shot. Harry Fletcher, the spokesman for the probation officers union, reports McLellan-Murray will face disciplinary charges of failing to account for the purchase of a gas cylinder worth \u00a3110, two electric sockets priced at \u00a38.56 and a \u00a3500 donation to the mentally ill from the prison's charitable funds. He is not being accused of pocketing the money. It is merely that he or one of his subordinates didn't fill out the right forms when they dealt with the paperwork. For these terrible sins, one of the finest public servants in the Home Office will see his career wrecked while Narey's flourishes. 'Scandal' is an overused word by hacks, but in this instance no other will do.",

Alternatively, perhaps his long shadow had simply kept others in the dark, unable or unwilling to grow properly themselves.</p> <p>Those questions will be answered before very long. Like many others, I felt sick when I heard that Donald Dewar was now the subject of that universal, inexplicable slide of the tense from 'is'; to 'was'. But the one person not to feel sorry for is the man himself. He was assailed from all sides in his final weeks. But he changed the world around him, stamped himself on his country's imagination and then died quickly from his chosen addiction, which was politics.</p>",

So there is an inner contradiction in the 'father of the nation' and 'who can replace him?' reaction to Dewar's death, which he would have been the first to seize upon and pick away at. If the Scottish Parliament is really a solid achievement, putting to sleep the nationalist threat, then why is the accident of his removal from the scene such a blow to it? Alternatively, perhaps his long shadow had simply kept others in the dark, unable or unwilling to grow properly themselves. Those questions will be answered before very long. Like many others, I felt sick when I heard that Donald Dewar was now the subject of that universal, inexplicable slide of the tense from 'is'; to 'was'. But the one person not to feel sorry for is the man himself. He was assailed from all sides in his final weeks. But he changed the world around him, stamped himself on his country's imagination and then died quickly from his chosen addiction, which was politics.",

To them, and to their millions of compatriots, the state of siege the Palestinians found themselves in and the underlying vitriolic hatreds released by the events of the previous weeks more than justified such an horrific act, an understandable reprisal, as one of them put it, by a resistance movement fighting against military occupation.</p> <p>It is not surprising, this outpouring of hate, this bloodstained Schadenfreude, fuelled as it is by 52 years of Palestinian dispossession, 33 years of military occupation and the callous disregard for Arab lives shown by Israel's security forces and politicians and its many friends abroad.

Yet it has been one they and their leader played out in mainly peaceful compliance until the beginning of the end of the whole affair at Camp David this summer. Then, the long-delayed but crucial issues of Jerusalem and refugees, Israel-Palestine borders and Jewish settlements, were finally addressed, with formidable pressure on Yasser Arafat to concede the match and yield any further claims against Israel, a pressure he successfully resisted with the reward of Arab accolade and American-Israeli contumely.</p> <p>Now it is the end, the bitter end, manifested in the physical explosion of Arab resentment, frustration and loss of hope inside the Occupied Territories and inside Israel proper - among its one million (second-class) Palestinian citizens - during the past 17 days.</p> <p>The essential flaw in the peace process is not just the vagueness of the original Oslo project, by which the Israelis were able to delay their staged military withdrawals from or redeployments in the Occupied Territories of the West Bank and Gaza to the extent that they are in possession of 60 per cent of the former and 20 per cent of the latter to this day, and still, as we see daily, effectively command and control the rest.</p> <p>It is not just that in the seven years of this process, against the spirit but not the letter, of Oslo, Israel's illegal settler population in the West Bank and Gaza (not counting the Jerusalem settlers) has expanded from 110,000 to 195,000.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Not one of the 100-plus recommendations in the Runnymede Trust's report on The Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain attracted media comment last week. Instead, the report was swamped by a tide of criticism. It was said to have argued that 'to be British is racist' and that therefore the term 'Britain' should be 'consigned to the dustbin of history'.</p> <p>It would indeed be presumptuous to propose writing Britain out of history and, in fact, the report did no such thing. We did say that, historically, the idea of Britishness carried 'largely unspoken racial connotations' - meaning that, in common understanding, the nation is usually imagined as white. Given the history of these islands, this seemed to us an incontrovertible statement of fact. Perhaps unwisely, the report expected journalists to understand the distinction between 'racial' (as in a 'racial group') and 'racist' (as in 'a racist group').</p> <p>We nowhere suggested that this was destined to remain so until the end of time. Indeed, we acknowledged that ideas of national belonging change, that new versions are emerging. Growing inclusiveness is already one positive result of the increasingly multicultural character of society. However, we were not prepared to say that the process had gone far enough and that everyone now felt equally included since, as the many direct quotations in the report show, this is manifestly not the case.</p> <p>That great patriot Enoch Powell once remarked that 'the life of nations is lived largely in the imagination'. It is worth continuing to ask the awkward question, how is the nation imagined? What pops into the mind's eye, when people say 'Britain' or 'British'? By now, few people can imagine the British Olympic team without a black face. On the other hand, during the recent celebration of 'Britain's Finest Hour', it was not the faces of Asian and Caribbean World War II volunteers which automatically first came to mind. Where were they in the fly-past?</p> <p>Far from suggesting that 'British' be dropped, we described the growing tendency for ethnic minority people to identify themselves as Black-British or British-Asian as a positive sign of their 'claim to belong'. But belonging is a tricky concept, requiring both identification and recognition. If people from ethnic minorities are to become not only citizens with equal rights but also an integral part of the national culture, then the meanings of the term 'British' will have to become more inclusive of their experiences, values and aspirations. Otherwise Britain will be a multi-ethnic, mono-cultural society, which is a contradiction in terms. The binding function of national identity only works if individuals can somehow see themselves reflected in the culture. Otherwise, they may feel British, but will not be publicly recognised to be so. Since the routes by which the minorities have travelled to this identity are different in some crucial respects from that taken by native people, they are unlikely to feel 'British' in exactly the same way. That is why the hyphen - Black-British, British-Asian - persists. Does the idea of 'Britishness' have room to accommodate these differences?</p> <p>It is really a visceral objection to this very question that motivated the torrent of misquotation and abuse. At times this week I longed to hear how this debate would be conducted in Edinburgh or Cardiff, let alone Haringey or Moss Side. Britain always was and really is now a nation of nations. It cannot continue to conflate 'Englishness' with 'Britishness'. Some commentators really do suppose that Britain will obliterate all trace of its imperial history, devolve government, integrate with the global economy, play an active role in Europe, treat all minority peoples as equal citizens - and retain its self-understanding intact since Magna Carta! This is not serious analysis, it is cloud-cuckoo land.</p> <p>As the coincidence of the Windrush celebrations and the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry showed, it is perfectly possible for multiculturalism and racism to coexist. The country is divided into three rough groups. Some think that Britain's multicultural character gives vibrancy and cultural energy to life and wouldn't have it any other way. Others tolerate 'multicultural drift', but are not passionately committed to it and hope, if they keep out of the great urban areas, it will leave them alone. Others are passionately hostile to the idea and feel threatened and culturally undermined by it. A minority of these are prepared to stick knives into it or set it alight when they encounter it on the streets.</p> <p>Only deep and rigorous measures to end discrimination can help us navigate these treacherous waters. I regret that the report's many important proposals were temporarily eclipsed by the debate about 'Britishness' but I don't regret the debate about identity has been engaged.</p> <p>\u0095 Stuart Hall was a Runnymede report commissioner.</p> <p>\u0095 Useful link: <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/racism/\">Special report: race issues in the UK</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Not one of the 100-plus recommendations in the Runnymede Trust's report on The Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain attracted media comment last week. Instead, the report was swamped by a tide of criticism. It was said to have argued that 'to be British is racist' and that therefore the term 'Britain' should be 'consigned to the dustbin of history'. It would indeed be presumptuous to propose writing Britain out of history and, in fact, the report did no such thing. We did say that, historically, the idea of Britishness carried 'largely unspoken racial connotations' - meaning that, in common understanding, the nation is usually imagined as white. Given the history of these islands, this seemed to us an incontrovertible statement of fact. Perhaps unwisely, the report expected journalists to understand the distinction between 'racial' (as in a 'racial group') and 'racist' (as in 'a racist group'). We nowhere suggested that this was destined to remain so until the end of time. Indeed, we acknowledged that ideas of national belonging change, that new versions are emerging. Growing inclusiveness is already one positive result of the increasingly multicultural character of society. However, we were not prepared to say that the process had gone far enough and that everyone now felt equally included since, as the many direct quotations in the report show, this is manifestly not the case. That great patriot Enoch Powell once remarked that 'the life of nations is lived largely in the imagination'. It is worth continuing to ask the awkward question, how is the nation imagined? What pops into the mind's eye, when people say 'Britain' or 'British'? By now, few people can imagine the British Olympic team without a black face. On the other hand, during the recent celebration of 'Britain's Finest Hour', it was not the faces of Asian and Caribbean World War II volunteers which automatically first came to mind. Where were they in the fly-past? Far from suggesting that 'British' be dropped, we described the growing tendency for ethnic minority people to identify themselves as Black-British or British-Asian as a positive sign of their 'claim to belong'. But belonging is a tricky concept, requiring both identification and recognition. If people from ethnic minorities are to become not only citizens with equal rights but also an integral part of the national culture, then the meanings of the term 'British' will have to become more inclusive of their experiences, values and aspirations. Otherwise Britain will be a multi-ethnic, mono-cultural society, which is a contradiction in terms. The binding function of national identity only works if individuals can somehow see themselves reflected in the culture. Otherwise, they may feel British, but will not be publicly recognised to be so. Since the routes by which the minorities have travelled to this identity are different in some crucial respects from that taken by native people, they are unlikely to feel 'British' in exactly the same way. That is why the hyphen - Black-British, British-Asian - persists. Does the idea of 'Britishness' have room to accommodate these differences? It is really a visceral objection to this very question that motivated the torrent of misquotation and abuse. At times this week I longed to hear how this debate would be conducted in Edinburgh or Cardiff, let alone Haringey or Moss Side. Britain always was and really is now a nation of nations. It cannot continue to conflate 'Englishness' with 'Britishness'. Some commentators really do suppose that Britain will obliterate all trace of its imperial history, devolve government, integrate with the global economy, play an active role in Europe, treat all minority peoples as equal citizens - and retain its self-understanding intact since Magna Carta! This is not serious analysis, it is cloud-cuckoo land. As the coincidence of the Windrush celebrations and the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry showed, it is perfectly possible for multiculturalism and racism to coexist. The country is divided into three rough groups. Some think that Britain's multicultural character gives vibrancy and cultural energy to life and wouldn't have it any other way. Others tolerate 'multicultural drift', but are not passionately committed to it and hope, if they keep out of the great urban areas, it will leave them alone. Others are passionately hostile to the idea and feel threatened and culturally undermined by it. A minority of these are prepared to stick knives into it or set it alight when they encounter it on the streets. Only deep and rigorous measures to end discrimination can help us navigate these treacherous waters. I regret that the report's many important proposals were temporarily eclipsed by the debate about 'Britishness' but I don't regret the debate about identity has been engaged. \u0095 Stuart Hall was a Runnymede report commissioner. \u0095 Useful link: Special report: race issues in the UK",

The truth is that many Britons feel entirely comfortable defining themselves as Black British, Chinese British or Indian British. Our history and, therefore, our identity has been shaped since our earliest days by immigration. The first people to come here were Germans - the Angles who arrived in the middle of fifth century. And down the centuries others have added to the mix, from the Normans to the Huguenots, to the Irish, Italians, Poles, Jamaicans and Bangladeshis. It is this diversity of backgrounds and experience which has defined us. Far from being a weakness, it is one of our great strengths. So I do not accept the argument that Britain or Britishness is dead. On the contrary, both are now receiving a new lease of life. Enduring British values of fairness, tolerance and decency are at the heart of the Government's reforms to build a more inclusive, stronger society. Three Labour government Race Relations Acts in the 1960s and 1970s helped create a moral as well as a legal regime in which racist actions and words were put beyond the pale. And since 1997 we have been able to build on those foundations through the first new race relations legislation in 25 years, the inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence which is leading to a sea change in attitudes in the police service and new laws to tackle racist violence and harassment. By embracing diversity, we can help build a Britain we can all be proud of - wherever we are from. Far from returning to the past, standing up for Britain means building a stronger society for all.",

This, too, leaked and she had to undergo a third open-heart operation.

      "body": "<p>Three Dublin criminals with close links to the Real IRA are believed by Irish police to have vital evidence that could convict the Omagh bombers. But political pressure from Dublin has prevented police use of the potential supergrasses' evidence.</p> <p>The Observer has learned that the trio, part of a North Dublin gang, were regarded by the Garda (Irish police) as potential vital state witnesses on the Real IRA unit behind the atrocity. The Omagh bomb, which killed 29 men, women and children, was the mass murder in British criminal history.</p> <p>Dublin government advisers were concerned that the use of evidence from criminals working with the Real IRA would alienate mainstream republicans opposed to a 'supergrass' system. The Irish government was also warned that Sinn Fein would oppose extradition of Real IRA suspects, on the word of such informants, to Northern Ireland and RUC custody.</p> <p>John Bruton, the Republic's opposition leader, said yesterday he would raise the allegations of political interference in the Omagh inquiry in the Dail (Irish parliament) later this week. 'The Omagh bombing was the biggest single crime committed in Ireland in the twentieth century,' he said. 'If these claims are true then it will turn into the biggest blot on law enforcement in this country.'</p> <p>Security sources on both sides of the border told The Observer that three men helped gardai foil several bomb plots prior to the Omagh massacre. Senior officers regarded them as potential witnesses for that crime.</p> <p>The Garda wants to use the same methods that led to the conviction of the killers of Dublin journalist Veronica Guerin in 1996. In that inquiry the 'accomplice evidence' or 'supergrasses', were prepared to give evidence against former criminal colleagues in return for protection. A protection scheme was set up by the Irish government in that case, but no such scheme was devised for Omagh.</p> <p>The use of such witnesses helped convict Paul Ward and Brian Meehan, the Dublin criminals who carried out the murder of Guerin.</p> <p>Sources point to the success of the Garda against the Real IRA before Omagh. Several bombs and caches of explosive were intercepted in early 1998. According to security sources, three criminal informants working with the Real IRA were vital to these successes. They had helped steal cars for the terror group, Pajero jeeps and BMWs for planned bomb attacks. The Real IRA, however, identified the source of the leaks and moved operations north of the border in early summer.</p> <p>In both the Republic and Northern Ireland police forces there is 'deep anger' over inability to use these informants against the Real IRA after Omagh. Three months after the atrocity the Irish police probe was wound down. Pat Byrne, head of the Garda Siochana, this year admitted that those behind the bomb would never be convicted. The names of the chief suspects, including two women, are known to both the Gardai and the RUC.</p> <p>Last Monday the BBC's Panorama programme named Colm Murphy, Liam Campbell, Seamus Daly and Oliver Trainor as possible Omagh bomb suspects.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Three Dublin criminals with close links to the Real IRA are believed by Irish police to have vital evidence that could convict the Omagh bombers. But political pressure from Dublin has prevented police use of the potential supergrasses' evidence. The Observer has learned that the trio, part of a North Dublin gang, were regarded by the Garda (Irish police) as potential vital state witnesses on the Real IRA unit behind the atrocity. The Omagh bomb, which killed 29 men, women and children, was the mass murder in British criminal history. Dublin government advisers were concerned that the use of evidence from criminals working with the Real IRA would alienate mainstream republicans opposed to a 'supergrass' system. The Irish government was also warned that Sinn Fein would oppose extradition of Real IRA suspects, on the word of such informants, to Northern Ireland and RUC custody. John Bruton, the Republic's opposition leader, said yesterday he would raise the allegations of political interference in the Omagh inquiry in the Dail (Irish parliament) later this week. 'The Omagh bombing was the biggest single crime committed in Ireland in the twentieth century,' he said. 'If these claims are true then it will turn into the biggest blot on law enforcement in this country.' Security sources on both sides of the border told The Observer that three men helped gardai foil several bomb plots prior to the Omagh massacre. Senior officers regarded them as potential witnesses for that crime. The Garda wants to use the same methods that led to the conviction of the killers of Dublin journalist Veronica Guerin in 1996. In that inquiry the 'accomplice evidence' or 'supergrasses', were prepared to give evidence against former criminal colleagues in return for protection. A protection scheme was set up by the Irish government in that case, but no such scheme was devised for Omagh. The use of such witnesses helped convict Paul Ward and Brian Meehan, the Dublin criminals who carried out the murder of Guerin. Sources point to the success of the Garda against the Real IRA before Omagh. Several bombs and caches of explosive were intercepted in early 1998. According to security sources, three criminal informants working with the Real IRA were vital to these successes. They had helped steal cars for the terror group, Pajero jeeps and BMWs for planned bomb attacks. The Real IRA, however, identified the source of the leaks and moved operations north of the border in early summer. In both the Republic and Northern Ireland police forces there is 'deep anger' over inability to use these informants against the Real IRA after Omagh. Three months after the atrocity the Irish police probe was wound down. Pat Byrne, head of the Garda Siochana, this year admitted that those behind the bomb would never be convicted. The names of the chief suspects, including two women, are known to both the Gardai and the RUC. Last Monday the BBC's Panorama programme named Colm Murphy, Liam Campbell, Seamus Daly and Oliver Trainor as possible Omagh bomb suspects.",

Jack Straw is to be formally asked by the Welsh Assembly to investigate the action of South Wales Police, which for almost two decades has been at the centre of allegations that at least 19 people have been wrongfully imprisoned. Nine murders remain unsolved after those originally charged walked free amid accusations of faked police interview notes, false or missing evidence, bribes and intimidation. The estimated cost to the taxpayer of 10 cases highlighted by campaigners, in court costs and probable compensation payouts, is \u00a320 million.

Production lines in Siberia, which once spewed out sparkling fountains of Coke, have been converted to make a new line of traditional Russian soft drinks - like kvas, a cloudy brown, alcohol-free yeast drink flavoured with the peculiar aroma of fermented stale rye bread. In a reverse of the cultural imperialism of Coca-Cola's aggressive invasion of Russia in the early Nineties, the firm has been forced to make concessions to local demand as it struggles to recoup huge losses in the region.

      "body": "<p>There is just no pleasing some people. After receiving a tentative email from a 'boy' I went to school with, I instantly and efficiently responded by demanding the contact details of everyone he's kept in touch with, and then firing off 10,000-word epics to all four corners of the globe.</p> <p>'Let's have a school reunion,' I say. 'Come on, it'll be fun. You find that person, you find the others. Somebody (not me, I'm too busy) should sort out the time and venue, and rustle up some free booze. Look, maybe it would be for the best if everybody (bar me) gave up their jobs temporarily to accommodate my vision of how this reunion should be. I'll just sit here and oversee things. I'll be the mastermind, the boss, the one everyone applauds at the end of the evening with tears of gratitude in their eyes. Yes, yes, nice to hear what you've been up to (all very fascinating if I happened to be your mother). Now do please get a move on, as I'm already excited about my plan, and all the glory coming my way.' </p> <p>And what I do get for all this effort, all this inspired brainstorming and selfless chivvying? Attitude, that's what I get. Attitude and mutiny. </p> <p>Of course, I'm into the idea of a reunion. I was drop-dead popular at school. Everyone loved me, everyone thought I was incredibly pretty and clever. I was forever fighting off suitors with hockey sticks and being walked around the sports field by eager young lads with shining eyes and blushing cheeks. Oh no, hang on a minute, that was my friends. But at least I was there when it happened to them. Sometimes, I got to hold their satchels as they counted their valentine cards. </p> <p>It wasn't my fault I was ugly, or, as local parlance had it, 'grim'. To be honest, it took me a while to notice. That's my advice to 'unpretty' young girls - blithely ignore your physical shortcomings, make ugliness your friend. More importantly, make friends with people who aren't ugly because that way, you spend your life, wading through a sea of boys who'd all like to get to know your friends better. A simple strategy, and not without pathos, but it definitely worked for me.</p> <p>There's always some people who try to spoil the party. When I spoke of my plan, a friend retorted that school reunions were a cruel bourgeois convention, all the more unkind because certain people might have fallen on hard times - lost their jobs, looks or health, or have just generally been crushed by life. The rest, he seemed to think, would be swanning around, bragging and posing about how well they'd all done, and patronising the masses. All melodramatic rot, if you ask me. We're talking about a Rutland comp, not Gordonstoun. </p> <p>Moreover, anybody trying to swan around on the back of attending our local sixth-form college (a low-rise monument to the cowboy building industry) would look very foolish indeed. I also take exception to the assumption that people I went to school with would have it in them to be vile braggarts and spiteful bullies. That was always my department.

      "bodyText": "There is just no pleasing some people. After receiving a tentative email from a 'boy' I went to school with, I instantly and efficiently responded by demanding the contact details of everyone he's kept in touch with, and then firing off 10,000-word epics to all four corners of the globe. 'Let's have a school reunion,' I say. 'Come on, it'll be fun. You find that person, you find the others. Somebody (not me, I'm too busy) should sort out the time and venue, and rustle up some free booze. Look, maybe it would be for the best if everybody (bar me) gave up their jobs temporarily to accommodate my vision of how this reunion should be. I'll just sit here and oversee things. I'll be the mastermind, the boss, the one everyone applauds at the end of the evening with tears of gratitude in their eyes. Yes, yes, nice to hear what you've been up to (all very fascinating if I happened to be your mother). Now do please get a move on, as I'm already excited about my plan, and all the glory coming my way.' And what I do get for all this effort, all this inspired brainstorming and selfless chivvying? Attitude, that's what I get. Attitude and mutiny. Of course, I'm into the idea of a reunion. I was drop-dead popular at school. Everyone loved me, everyone thought I was incredibly pretty and clever. I was forever fighting off suitors with hockey sticks and being walked around the sports field by eager young lads with shining eyes and blushing cheeks. Oh no, hang on a minute, that was my friends. But at least I was there when it happened to them. Sometimes, I got to hold their satchels as they counted their valentine cards. It wasn't my fault I was ugly, or, as local parlance had it, 'grim'. To be honest, it took me a while to notice. That's my advice to 'unpretty' young girls - blithely ignore your physical shortcomings, make ugliness your friend. More importantly, make friends with people who aren't ugly because that way, you spend your life, wading through a sea of boys who'd all like to get to know your friends better. A simple strategy, and not without pathos, but it definitely worked for me. There's always some people who try to spoil the party. When I spoke of my plan, a friend retorted that school reunions were a cruel bourgeois convention, all the more unkind because certain people might have fallen on hard times - lost their jobs, looks or health, or have just generally been crushed by life. The rest, he seemed to think, would be swanning around, bragging and posing about how well they'd all done, and patronising the masses. All melodramatic rot, if you ask me. We're talking about a Rutland comp, not Gordonstoun. Moreover, anybody trying to swan around on the back of attending our local sixth-form college (a low-rise monument to the cowboy building industry) would look very foolish indeed. I also take exception to the assumption that people I went to school with would have it in them to be vile braggarts and spiteful bullies. That was always my department. Everyone else seemed pretty nice. Saying that, I would concede that school reunions are little more than a communal explosion of egomania masquerading as affectionate nostalgia. You assume that people want to see you again. You assume that people wanted to see you in the first place. The fact that you might be forgotten doesn't enter your head. Even considering the possibility is painful - it means that you have to confront your own irrelevance, it means they were lying in It's A Wonderful Life. Anyway, nothing ventured, nothing gained.

      "body": "<p>The most intriguing question about the internet is whether it will turn out to be a genuinely subversive technology or whether en-trenched power structures - governments, transnational corporations, cultural establishments - will eventually get a grip on it and subvert it to their own ends. </p> <p>Cyber-libertarians have never been in any doubt. Their view was summed up in John Gilmore's dictum that 'the internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it'. Libertarian suspicion of the evil establishments of the 'real' world was tempered by the consoling thought that these institutions were also irredeemably stupid. </p> <p>The collective IQ of the net was always going to be greater than anything the FBI, GCHQ, Microsoft or the legal profession could muster. And whatever the forces of darkness came up with, the net community could easily circumvent, disrupt or subvert. The balance of power between freedom and control had been irrevocably shifted - and so the internet became a uniquely subversive technology. </p> <p>In principle, this argument remains valid. The technology of the net, and the fact that software is pure 'thought-stuff', means that the subversive creativity of the internet community cannot be snuffed out. There will always be 16-year-old hackers capable of inventing ingenious mouse-traps which can be distributed globally within minutes. Short of banning the use of computers, shutting down the global telephone network and shooting all 16-year-olds on sight, there is little any authority structure can do about it. </p> <p>Where the libertarian com munity errs is in thinking that this is all that matters. So long as the internet remained a virtual playground for geeks, Gilmore's mantra did indeed apply. It still does. </p> <p>But once the net became a mass medium, accessed and used by hundreds of millions of 'ordinary' people and firms - for email, entertainment and commerce - the complacent optimism of the libertarian position began to look like a philosophy of denial. </p> <p>The difference is that established power structures are able to exert much more leverage on a mass medium than they could on a geek playground. Most internet users now are 'ordinary' folk, who lack both the talent and the motivation to cock a snook at authority. They access the net through internet service providers, companies run by accountants who carry no torches for liberty or anarchy. </p> <p>And e-commerce companies aspire to the same status: they are after profits, stability, and the protection of their intellectual property.

      "bodyText": "The most intriguing question about the internet is whether it will turn out to be a genuinely subversive technology or whether en-trenched power structures - governments, transnational corporations, cultural establishments - will eventually get a grip on it and subvert it to their own ends. Cyber-libertarians have never been in any doubt. Their view was summed up in John Gilmore's dictum that 'the internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it'. Libertarian suspicion of the evil establishments of the 'real' world was tempered by the consoling thought that these institutions were also irredeemably stupid. The collective IQ of the net was always going to be greater than anything the FBI, GCHQ, Microsoft or the legal profession could muster. And whatever the forces of darkness came up with, the net community could easily circumvent, disrupt or subvert. The balance of power between freedom and control had been irrevocably shifted - and so the internet became a uniquely subversive technology. In principle, this argument remains valid. The technology of the net, and the fact that software is pure 'thought-stuff', means that the subversive creativity of the internet community cannot be snuffed out. There will always be 16-year-old hackers capable of inventing ingenious mouse-traps which can be distributed globally within minutes. Short of banning the use of computers, shutting down the global telephone network and shooting all 16-year-olds on sight, there is little any authority structure can do about it. Where the libertarian com munity errs is in thinking that this is all that matters. So long as the internet remained a virtual playground for geeks, Gilmore's mantra did indeed apply. It still does. But once the net became a mass medium, accessed and used by hundreds of millions of 'ordinary' people and firms - for email, entertainment and commerce - the complacent optimism of the libertarian position began to look like a philosophy of denial. The difference is that established power structures are able to exert much more leverage on a mass medium than they could on a geek playground. Most internet users now are 'ordinary' folk, who lack both the talent and the motivation to cock a snook at authority. They access the net through internet service providers, companies run by accountants who carry no torches for liberty or anarchy. And e-commerce companies aspire to the same status: they are after profits, stability, and the protection of their intellectual property. Few of the key players in the mass-internet want trouble with the established order; in a way they want to be part of it. The Napster case illustrates this. The libertarian position is that it doesn't matter what happens to Napster in the courts because the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking genie is out of the bottle. This is true but beside the point, which is that the moment somebody runs away with these subversive technologies they become something different - and are suddenly more vulnerable to legal attack. The thing about Napster, remember, is not so much that it had zillions of users, but that it wanted to become a billion-dollar company on the backs of those users. This is why the recording companies are so interested in it. 'File-sharing means we have to think about a fundamental change of the business model,' Sony's chairman and chief executive told the Financial Times recently. The companies want to destroy Napster not because they desire to stamp out its disruptive technology, but because they want to deploy it for their own ends. Who are the real subversives now? john.naughton@observer.co.uk",

When the US government wanted to take on the corporate behemoth of Microsoft in the anti-trust trial, it hired Boies. And after a few lengthy stints before the judge, he caused the biggest company in the world to consider breaking up. </p> <p>But he could have been forgiven for thinking this airport delay was just another sign that his luck was turning. His current client, Napster, the internet company that invented a piece of software so powerful it threatened to swamp the world with pirated music, was being sued by the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA). </p> <p>The case was not going well. Boies had lost the first court battle, and, with this huge challenge in the balance, he was stuck in a departure lounge. The flight was blighted by one mechanical problem after another, and they were paying people not to board. </p> <p>Once finally on the plane, Boies became aware of a man repeatedly turning to look at him. Eventually, the stranger asked: 'Hey, aren't you the Napster lawyer?' Boies assented, and then his inquisitor stood up and announced: 'Napster's lawyer is on the plane.' A cheer rose among the tired crowd of passengers. For the first time that day, perhaps, Boies knew that, even if not in the legal sense, he was backing the winning side. </p> <p>The court battle between the reactionary RIAA and the copyright-insolent Napster is set to reach its climax within the next couple of weeks. Whichever way the judgment goes, though, Boies's airborne experience is as clear a sign as any that the war is already lost for the RIAA. </p> <p>Three things are clear about Napster. The first is that it lets anyone copy and share MP3 files - files that use special compression techniques to digitise music so that it can be downloaded over the internet - with alarming ease and at virtually no cost. The second is that many of these duplications or 'exchanges' break time-honoured copyright rules, the laws that ensured the artists got their royalties when the record company sold their music. The third is that people love it. More than 35 million people are now fully fledged converts to the church of Napster. And, after years of paying through the nose for CDs, they don't mind breaking the law to visit it. </p> <p>It has divided some of the biggest names in the music world. Anti-Napster band Metallica have criticised their fans for enjoying the service too much. The Corrs are also in the anti-Napster camp. Radiohead, however, were far more sanguine when their latest album, Kid A , popped up on Napster prior to its massively hyped launch. Perhaps Radiohead's stoicism is the best way to deal with Napster. </p> <p>The court case may eventually force Napster to shut down, but it has spawned a host of imitators who are not going to disappear. In fact, the International Federation of Phonographic Industries estimates that there are currently at least 25 million illegal music files on the internet, producing up to 5 million downloads every year. </p> <p>Take Gnutella, for example. Gnutella is basically the internet's answer to Frankenstein's monster. It was developed as an unofficial project by a team of programmers at America Online who released it onto their website in March, only to realise the consequences of what they were doing and shut it down 24 hours later. </p> <p>Too late: the Gnutella code was out in the wild wild web and significantly it was a serious improvement on Napster. Unlike its predecessor, Gnutella doesn't have a central data base. This is crucial. Napster's central catalogue of music directs users to various sites where they can download records of their choice. Gnutella, however, constructs a labyrinth of virtual private networks which means there is no one point of reference - making it almost impossible for the music industry to kill it via legal action. </p> <p>'There's no one body hosting the index, so there's nobody the industry can sue. It's extremely difficult to prevent Gnutella from existing,' said Jay Marathe, head of consulting with technology investment firm Durlacher. </p> <p>Significantly, Napster, too, is using the index argument as a defence. The company no longer pools music on a centralised database, only directions as to where to find different artists located on various servers in cyberspace. Napster's critics, however, argue that this index is clearly designed to enable people to pirate music. </p> <p>The music industry is not the only business sector that is watching the Napster case with great interest. Scour.net and DIVX, two daring deviants to Napster which allow users to download film and video clips, are currently attracting an enormous following. </p> <p>The music industry now tacitly accepts that, if Boies has to retire a beaten man, another Napster variant is likely to spring up and take over the mantle. In a sign of weary recognition, Paul Russell, head of Sony Music Europe, conceded that it would be possible to accept the likes of Napster - if it used its online advertising revenues to pay and promote artists. </p> <p>'If they came along and said, \"We are smarter than you. We are going to sign up artists and we are going to invest in their careers and we are going to put their music up and invest in their careers\" I could live with that,' Russell said earlier this year. </p> <p>But the real challenge for the record labels is to create a viable online alternative to the likes of Napster which, while never being able to kill online piracy, will prevent it from dominating the industry. </p> <p>The future is not totally gloomy. After all, the record able audio cassette didn't kill the LP or the CD. For similar reasons the online pirates might not end up ruining the music industry. </p> <p>'At present it's very difficult to find the tracks that you want using Napster. It's often very slow, the names of the artists are sometimes wrong, it sends you to hard drives that are not that reliable. If I wanted to create my own compilation of tracks it's a long, hard slog. If the music industry could offer these sort of improved services, I believe that people would be willing to pay for the service,' Marathe said. </p> <p>But so far the music industry has been slow to react, choosing simply to swat the pirates with legal action. This is not a viable strategy for the future. The major record labels know that, whatever the Napster court case ruling, the judgment will ultimately change nothing.

      "bodyText": "Insurers may be smarting from unhappy homeowners' refusal to be cowed over the endowments scandal, but overall the industry must be feeling smug about its tussles with consumers and the Government. Successful lobbying must have helped to limit the nature of the endowments clean-up, and now insurers are getting their own way over genetic testing. They have the Government's blessing to demand that customers tell them the results of the first of what is likely to become a string of genetic tests. The insurers, of course, are keen to put forward the idea that someone who can show a negative result will be able to get cover without difficulty. True, but it is ques tionable that this will be a sustained advantage to potential sufferers of hereditary illnesses because those who have not already had tests may be deterred from doing so. A delicious irony would be to see genetic testing become so widespread that companies destroyed their market by rejecting virtually all potential customers, but we are a long way from that. The insurers must now prove themselves worthy of their latest lobbying victory by seeking ways to insure individuals with risky genetic backgrounds at reasonable rates, and dealing with them sensitively. If they are unwilling or unable to do so, they must make this clear so that alternative forms of protection, perhaps backed by the Government, can be set up. Start an early New Year's resolution list with the words, 'change bank'. From January the banks will streamline systems for switching accounts, and Halifax plans a high-paying current account. Consumers can finally shake the monopoly of the high street dinosaurs.",

I hoped very much that Kevin, who might have got even squelchier under the full glare of the studio lights, would put the Moon, the Earth, Jupiter and the Sun into the ascending order, sizewise, in the fastest time and thus make it into the hot seat, but he didn't. </p> <p>Shame - Chris Tarrant would surely have enjoyed a Kevin Squelch, the best character Martin Amis never created. And a glance at my local phone directory revealed that he wasn't necessarily a pesudonymous would-be stand-up comedian, either, for here were two more real Squelches a mere postcode away, sandwiched squidgily between a Squarenina and a Squibb.</p> <p> It's been a very fleshly, slightly squelchy sort of week. I squirmed for Jamie Oliver, a guest on <strong>The Frank Skinner Show</strong> on Monday night, when the wardrobe door from his childhood bedroom was wheeled on so that Frank could recreate, for a wider audience, the humiliation of Oliver's recent wedding reception, when his dad had done the same thing. The door was daubed with the young Oliver's drawings of Empire State penises and female pudenda imagined from a gynaecological perspective. 'You bastard,' muttered the Naked Chef, pinkly, struggling to retain his cool as Skinner refused to let it lie. Oliver's face said it all: I wonder what Sainsbury's will think . It wasn't very funny, but then Skinner rarely is. </p> <p>And then, of course, there came the squelchiest moment of the television week, year, decade, millennium, whatever. I had dutifully tuned in to <strong>The National Television Awards</strong>, because it was live and one could only hope that Michael Barrymore might get even more tired and emotional than he had last year... but Judy Finnigan accidentally flashing her foundations?</p> <p>This is the kind of event that TV critics think they dream of, except that when it happens, in all its awesome cringefulness, there isn't much to say aside from 'Bra! Blimey! On live TV! Didn't she handle it like a trouper?!' - and everybody has been saying that all week so I hardly need bother.</p> <p>'You've got a place in TV history now,' observed guest Phill Jupitus on Wednesday's This Morning . Sobering news for Judy that, despite a hugely successful TV career, this was probably her defining professional moment and when it comes to the obituary it will be her breasts that bear the burden of her celebrity. </p> <p>On Thursday, right after Kevin Squelch, we had Kay Mellor's new comedy drama,<strong> Fat Friends</strong>. Earlier in the day, a magazine survey of 5,000 women had revealed that one in 100 women is satisfied with her body (as many as that? Who did they interview - supermodels?) and that 85 per cent admit they worry about their body every day (could be worse, I suppose. Could be 95 per cent worrying every hour, on the hour), so I think Kay Mellor will find her audience. </p> <p>Set among the members of a northern slimming club run by diet guru Julia Fleshman (a slightly overwrought Josie Lawrence), the show wasted no time setting its agenda: Fat May Be A Feminist Issue, But If It's On ITV At 9pm It's Still Quite Funny. Alison Steadman, as Betty Simpson, had lost five-and-a-half stone on the Fleshman diet and was up for a regional slimmer of the year award. 'I bet you feel like a different person!' she was asked. 'Yeah, she used to be happy and always laughing and now she's a bloody misery!' interjected her size-22 daughter, Kelly (Ruth Jones). Kelly was very big, but - hurrah! - happy with her body, though still attempting to fit into a wedding dress two sizes too small (to the skinny, disapproving shop assistant: 'Don't suppose you get much call for fat girls getting wed'), while Betty thought being thinner would change her life but, confusingly, her husband treated her exactly the same as he ever had. </p> <p>Mellor gives good one-liners: 'She's been up and down that many times her fat thinks it's got d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu ' and 'If I'm ever on a life-support machine, don't turn it off until I'm a size 10', but the plot swiftly sacrificed anything it might have craved to say about rampant body fascism, or women's warped self-esteem, for out-and-out prime-time, feel-good ratings-grabbing sentimentality. It will be an enormous hit, even without Dawn French. </p> <p>The first episode of the long-awaited second series of <strong>The Sopranos</strong> opened with an elegiac series of vignettes revealing that Tony Soprano's stomach is spreading comfortably, his midlife crisis is still in full swing (conducted by Nelson Riddle) and he remains overly nostalgic for the days when a man could slip unselfconsciously into a pair of two-tone brogues, polish off a business rival, sleep with a mighty beautiful woman and down three martinis, all before lunch.</p> <p> The series kicked off not with a bang, but with that dangerously sentimental Sinatra croon - 'When I was 35/ It was a very good year/ For blue-blooded girls of independent means/ We'd ride in limousines (etc)...' - so it was a good few minutes before the first shockingly cold-blooded execution and wincingly gratuitous beating, by which time I was leafing through my vinyl in search of Sinatra's Songs for Swingin' Lovers while Tony was suffering from paranoid delusions and panic attacks, or perhaps indigestion. Brilliant, brutal business as usual in New Jersey, then. </p> <p>Despite the violence, The Sopranos couldn't compete with the week's scariest programme, <strong>Hidden Love</strong>. 'Living in a world totally bereft of intimacy and closeness is for most of us intolerable and a small number of people move into delusion,' we were told. A small number? I don't think I know anybody who hasn't teetered close to the edge of De Clerambault's syndrome, which is when ordinary, lovesick souls make the leap to become obsessive, fixated stalkers: erotomaniacs.

      "bodyText": "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ITV The Frank Skinner Show ITV The National Television Awards ITV Fat Friends ITV The Sopranos C4 Hidden Love C4 Black Books C4 On last Thursday's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, there was a delightfully rounded contestant called Kevin Squelch. I hoped very much that Kevin, who might have got even squelchier under the full glare of the studio lights, would put the Moon, the Earth, Jupiter and the Sun into the ascending order, sizewise, in the fastest time and thus make it into the hot seat, but he didn't. Shame - Chris Tarrant would surely have enjoyed a Kevin Squelch, the best character Martin Amis never created. And a glance at my local phone directory revealed that he wasn't necessarily a pesudonymous would-be stand-up comedian, either, for here were two more real Squelches a mere postcode away, sandwiched squidgily between a Squarenina and a Squibb. It's been a very fleshly, slightly squelchy sort of week. I squirmed for Jamie Oliver, a guest on The Frank Skinner Show on Monday night, when the wardrobe door from his childhood bedroom was wheeled on so that Frank could recreate, for a wider audience, the humiliation of Oliver's recent wedding reception, when his dad had done the same thing. The door was daubed with the young Oliver's drawings of Empire State penises and female pudenda imagined from a gynaecological perspective. 'You bastard,' muttered the Naked Chef, pinkly, struggling to retain his cool as Skinner refused to let it lie. Oliver's face said it all: I wonder what Sainsbury's will think . It wasn't very funny, but then Skinner rarely is. And then, of course, there came the squelchiest moment of the television week, year, decade, millennium, whatever. I had dutifully tuned in to The National Television Awards, because it was live and one could only hope that Michael Barrymore might get even more tired and emotional than he had last year... but Judy Finnigan accidentally flashing her foundations? This is the kind of event that TV critics think they dream of, except that when it happens, in all its awesome cringefulness, there isn't much to say aside from 'Bra! Blimey! On live TV! Didn't she handle it like a trouper?!' - and everybody has been saying that all week so I hardly need bother. 'You've got a place in TV history now,' observed guest Phill Jupitus on Wednesday's This Morning . Sobering news for Judy that, despite a hugely successful TV career, this was probably her defining professional moment and when it comes to the obituary it will be her breasts that bear the burden of her celebrity. On Thursday, right after Kevin Squelch, we had Kay Mellor's new comedy drama, Fat Friends. Earlier in the day, a magazine survey of 5,000 women had revealed that one in 100 women is satisfied with her body (as many as that? Who did they interview - supermodels?) and that 85 per cent admit they worry about their body every day (could be worse, I suppose. Could be 95 per cent worrying every hour, on the hour), so I think Kay Mellor will find her audience. Set among the members of a northern slimming club run by diet guru Julia Fleshman (a slightly overwrought Josie Lawrence), the show wasted no time setting its agenda: Fat May Be A Feminist Issue, But If It's On ITV At 9pm It's Still Quite Funny. Alison Steadman, as Betty Simpson, had lost five-and-a-half stone on the Fleshman diet and was up for a regional slimmer of the year award. 'I bet you feel like a different person!' she was asked. 'Yeah, she used to be happy and always laughing and now she's a bloody misery!' interjected her size-22 daughter, Kelly (Ruth Jones). Kelly was very big, but - hurrah! - happy with her body, though still attempting to fit into a wedding dress two sizes too small (to the skinny, disapproving shop assistant: 'Don't suppose you get much call for fat girls getting wed'), while Betty thought being thinner would change her life but, confusingly, her husband treated her exactly the same as he ever had. Mellor gives good one-liners: 'She's been up and down that many times her fat thinks it's got d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu ' and 'If I'm ever on a life-support machine, don't turn it off until I'm a size 10', but the plot swiftly sacrificed anything it might have craved to say about rampant body fascism, or women's warped self-esteem, for out-and-out prime-time, feel-good ratings-grabbing sentimentality. It will be an enormous hit, even without Dawn French. The first episode of the long-awaited second series of The Sopranos opened with an elegiac series of vignettes revealing that Tony Soprano's stomach is spreading comfortably, his midlife crisis is still in full swing (conducted by Nelson Riddle) and he remains overly nostalgic for the days when a man could slip unselfconsciously into a pair of two-tone brogues, polish off a business rival, sleep with a mighty beautiful woman and down three martinis, all before lunch. The series kicked off not with a bang, but with that dangerously sentimental Sinatra croon - 'When I was 35/ It was a very good year/ For blue-blooded girls of independent means/ We'd ride in limousines (etc)...' - so it was a good few minutes before the first shockingly cold-blooded execution and wincingly gratuitous beating, by which time I was leafing through my vinyl in search of Sinatra's Songs for Swingin' Lovers while Tony was suffering from paranoid delusions and panic attacks, or perhaps indigestion. Brilliant, brutal business as usual in New Jersey, then. Despite the violence, The Sopranos couldn't compete with the week's scariest programme, Hidden Love. 'Living in a world totally bereft of intimacy and closeness is for most of us intolerable and a small number of people move into delusion,' we were told. A small number? I don't think I know anybody who hasn't teetered close to the edge of De Clerambault's syndrome, which is when ordinary, lovesick souls make the leap to become obsessive, fixated stalkers: erotomaniacs. As Ian McEwan, who wrote about the subject in his novel Enduring Love, observed: '[De Clerambault's] just turned the heat up under a number of things that were common to all of us.' In other words, the truly scary thing about the illness is the thinness of the line that separates the near- madness of ordinary, acceptable lovesickness from the sheer madness of obsession. Trevor is the star of his own Play Misty For Me , fixated on a radio DJ whom he believes loves him and sends messages via her show. But while Trevor is obviously, recognisably and sadly disurbed, fellow-sufferer Karen was somehow even more unsettling because she looked and sounded perfectly normal even when she was saying, earnestly: 'There's an affinity between us', of a man she has seen only once, nine years ago. Caught in a world they see as riddled with signs and portents, the tiniest of coincidences (car number plates, overheard conversations) are all fuel for the un-extinguishable flames of obsessively unrequited love, even when court orders are in place and prison terms are being served. But then something odd happens - a weird coincidence, A Sign - and you find yourself suddenly sucked into A Syndrome. It happened to me while watching Black Books, the funniest programme on TV. I nearly wrote about it last week and the week before but, for some reason, I waited. Now I know why. Now I know that its star, Dylan Moran, is trying to tell me that, yes, he loves me as much as I love him, maybe even more, despite the obstacles that stand in our way - which include not having met, stuff like that. Last week's painfully hilarious episode (Plot? Oh, if you must: a \u00a37,000 bottle of Bordeaux, destined for the Pope but drunk in error by Moran and sidekick, Bill Bailey) finished with Moran reading The Observer. I'm not stupid, Dylan. You don't imagine I'd miss A Sign as blindingly obvious as that, do you? Do you...?",

The city already has a force of nearly 1,800. Zero tolerance, says Shakar, as practised in New York, has targeted immigrant communities.</p> <p>'We'll all be suspects,' he says. 'One handbag will be stolen and 100 Moroccan youths will be arrested.

'You have an interview with DeWinter?', asks Fatah Hajaj. He laughs: 'Make sure you bomb that building.'</p> <p>Hajaj and his three friends could barely wait to finish school. Earlier in the day, Shakar had described the city's ethnic teenagers as 'the no-future generation'.</p> <p>Only 10 per cent of the Moroccan children opt for further education. 'There are no jobs for us, so why should we study?' asks Hajaj. 'There is very little for us to do. With Vlaams Blok in power, there will be even less for us to do.'</p> <p>Vlaams Blok has exploited the fear of immigrant crime.

She worked as an au pair in London - 'I liked the city,' she says. 'Every part is so different'. Asked to translate some posters on the walls, she is sheepish. 'You don't understand,' she says. 'Some of these Moroccans are like terrorists. We find them very threatening.'</p> <p>Does Vlaams Blok have any Asian members? 'Yes,' she says.

In the city centre, only streets away from the city's halal butchers, staff at the Federation of Moroccan Organisations still struggle to digest last Sunday's election results. The group represents 50 ethnic welfare organisations. 'How do you think we feel,' says Muhammad Shakar, the director. 'We're living in a city where almost a third of the population voted for Vlaams Blok. Imagine a Turkish child at school being taught by a teacher who has voted for DeWinter. Do you think that teacher will have a clear head when it comes to marking that boy's exams?' Shakar's primary concern is Vlaams Blok's calls for an extra 600 police in Antwerp. The city already has a force of nearly 1,800. Zero tolerance, says Shakar, as practised in New York, has targeted immigrant communities. 'We'll all be suspects,' he says. 'One handbag will be stolen and 100 Moroccan youths will be arrested. DeWinter is always talking about New York as a blueprint, but look at the civil rights abuses committed by the police there.' Later on Wednesday, a group of Moroccan teenagers stand sharing cigarettes outside a sweet shop in Amerikalie Street. Dressed in the international urban uniform - baggy jeans and throwover anoraks - they huddle together against a chilly wind. The Vlaams Blok office can be seen down the street. 'You have an interview with DeWinter?', asks Fatah Hajaj. He laughs: 'Make sure you bomb that building.' Hajaj and his three friends could barely wait to finish school. Earlier in the day, Shakar had described the city's ethnic teenagers as 'the no-future generation'. Only 10 per cent of the Moroccan children opt for further education. 'There are no jobs for us, so why should we study?' asks Hajaj. 'There is very little for us to do. With Vlaams Blok in power, there will be even less for us to do.' Vlaams Blok has exploited the fear of immigrant crime. A recent pamphlet depicts a city overrun by immigrants - a cartoon depicts an Arab restaurant whose speciality is a bombe surprise . A city-centre gun battle between the Eastern European mafia and the police two weeks ago provided vital votes for Vlaams Blok at the council elections. After the interview with DeWinter, his secretary calls The Observer a taxi. She worked as an au pair in London - 'I liked the city,' she says. 'Every part is so different'. Asked to translate some posters on the walls, she is sheepish. 'You don't understand,' she says. 'Some of these Moroccans are like terrorists. We find them very threatening.' Does Vlaams Blok have any Asian members? 'Yes,' she says. She pauses: 'No.' Useful Links: Institute of Race Relations Guardian special report: the Austrian far right in power",

Last month Michel Auger, one of Canada's top investigative journalists, was climbing out of his car at the office of Le Journal de Montreal when a man in a balaclava came up behind him and shot him five times with a handgun. Two weeks ago, antiques dealer Alan Decabral, the man who helped put road-rage killer Kenneth Noye behind bars, was sitting in his son's car outside Halfords in Ashford, Kent, when a man appeared at his window and shot him once in the side of the head.</p> <p>The two incidents were thousands of miles apart and had different outcomes - Auger is still alive, whereas Decabral died instantly - but detectives believe the attacks could be linked to a rapidly escalating war between biker gangs, fighting for control of a lucrative drug trade. The Canadian Hell's Angels have been linked to a string of murders and police are investigating a theory that Decabral, a member of a British biker gang, may have crossed them over a drugs deal - and paid the price.</p> <p>Initially, the finger of suspicion in the Decabral murder pointed at Noye, who is one of Britain's most dangerous men and a serial bearer of grudges. Decabral had given evidence at the Old Bailey trial into the murder of Stephen Cameron that Noye had stabbed Cameron and then walked nonchalantly back to his Range Rover. Decabral dialled 999 and gave chase in his Rolls Royce before losing Noye. There were reports that he received death threats shortly before taking the stand; that three bullets were pushed through his letter box.</p> <p>The stress of playing a key role in Noye's downfall was said to be so great that Decabral's wife left him. He was forced to shut his business and moved to the quiet village of Pluckley in Kent. Eight weeks before he was killed, he told a newspaper that he spent all his time looking over his shoulder.</p> <p>For a man supposedly living in fear, Decabral took few precautions. He had been offered, but refused, police protection. He had continued using his own name and made little attempt to blend into the shadows. Weighing more than 20 stone with a distinctive beard and hair, Decabral was well-known in his village and beyond. His notoriety grew further after he was banned from his local pub after fighting with another customer.</p> <p>Far from being an innocent victim of the underworld, Decabral was closely allied with some of Britain's most powerful villains.

His \u00a3350,000 house in Pluckley was bought without a mortgage, he owned a number of vehicles including a Rolls-Royce and a Jaguar and, when his house was raided a few months before his death, police found a \u00a3100,000 stash of \u00a350 notes. There had been three raids on the home in the 18 months before his death.

For maximum street cred last week, the hottest ticket was not a rock concert but a daring new Glyndebourne production featuring impoverished students snorting cocaine.</p> <p>Puccini's nineteenth century hit, La Boh\u00e8me, has been thrilling Glyndebourne audiences in an updated version of the story of a group of artists starving together in a Parisian garret in the 1830s. Gone are the frockcoats, easels and berets. Instead the two heroes, writer Rodolfo and painter Marcello, share a squalid bedsit in modern London and are shown taking drugs together - a first for Glyndebourne and an artistic decision that has upset some of the regulars at the Sussex opera house.</p> <p>'I love the music and the story - it always makes me so sad,' said regular opera-goer Isobel Carter, who is in her seventies. 'But why do they have to put in a nasty thing like that? I just can't understand it.'</p> <p>So far, critics have been more welcoming of David McVicar's radical rethink of the opera and have praised his cast of attractive, twenty-something unknowns. 'This is a story about young people, and audiences are responding to seeing it played by young people,' said a spokeswoman for Glyndebourne Touring Opera.</p> <p>Commentators who have worked in opera production have noted wryly that drugs are not quite such a novelty backstage. 'In my experience of the opera houses of the world, most shows would never be ready in time for curtain up if the crew did not indulge,' said a stagehand in the West End.</p> <p>'The singers don't take any because it ruins the voice,' said one former director, who went on to concede that opera crews might take drugs to cope with their late-night schedules.</p> <p>The change in opera's potential audience is the result of an outcrop of imaginative new productions all aimed at proving how entertaining and relevant opera can be. The tragic La Boh\u00e8me, first performed in Turin in 1896, is one of the most romantic works in the classical canon but until now had few points of reference for younger people. The central love story concerns Rodolfo's chance encounter with a consumptive neighbour called Mimi. In the original libretto she comes to ask him for a light for her candle. In the new production she makes the request because the electric lights in their block of flats have fused.</p> <p>In the final scene, a dying Mimi returns to Rodolfo's door. Conventionally the boys and their two friends, Schaunard, a musician, and Colline, a philosopher, have been dancing in a frantic effort to cheer up the dejected Rodolfo and to celebrate the purchase of a large fish for supper. In the new production a packet of drugs is fetched, along with the fish, and lines of cocaine are passed around. Only Rodolfo, who is pining for Mimi, does not partake.</p> <p>'The director could not see how young men in this day and age could be expected to get excited about a wet fish,' explained Mandy Chang, who is making a film for Channel 4 about the new production.

      "bodyText": "Loud music, sex and fast living have long been seen as teenage territory. Opera-goers have a fustier, more \u00e9litist image. But all that is changing. For maximum street cred last week, the hottest ticket was not a rock concert but a daring new Glyndebourne production featuring impoverished students snorting cocaine. Puccini's nineteenth century hit, La Boh\u00e8me, has been thrilling Glyndebourne audiences in an updated version of the story of a group of artists starving together in a Parisian garret in the 1830s. Gone are the frockcoats, easels and berets. Instead the two heroes, writer Rodolfo and painter Marcello, share a squalid bedsit in modern London and are shown taking drugs together - a first for Glyndebourne and an artistic decision that has upset some of the regulars at the Sussex opera house. 'I love the music and the story - it always makes me so sad,' said regular opera-goer Isobel Carter, who is in her seventies. 'But why do they have to put in a nasty thing like that? I just can't understand it.' So far, critics have been more welcoming of David McVicar's radical rethink of the opera and have praised his cast of attractive, twenty-something unknowns. 'This is a story about young people, and audiences are responding to seeing it played by young people,' said a spokeswoman for Glyndebourne Touring Opera. Commentators who have worked in opera production have noted wryly that drugs are not quite such a novelty backstage. 'In my experience of the opera houses of the world, most shows would never be ready in time for curtain up if the crew did not indulge,' said a stagehand in the West End. 'The singers don't take any because it ruins the voice,' said one former director, who went on to concede that opera crews might take drugs to cope with their late-night schedules. The change in opera's potential audience is the result of an outcrop of imaginative new productions all aimed at proving how entertaining and relevant opera can be. The tragic La Boh\u00e8me, first performed in Turin in 1896, is one of the most romantic works in the classical canon but until now had few points of reference for younger people. The central love story concerns Rodolfo's chance encounter with a consumptive neighbour called Mimi. In the original libretto she comes to ask him for a light for her candle. In the new production she makes the request because the electric lights in their block of flats have fused. In the final scene, a dying Mimi returns to Rodolfo's door. Conventionally the boys and their two friends, Schaunard, a musician, and Colline, a philosopher, have been dancing in a frantic effort to cheer up the dejected Rodolfo and to celebrate the purchase of a large fish for supper. In the new production a packet of drugs is fetched, along with the fish, and lines of cocaine are passed around. Only Rodolfo, who is pining for Mimi, does not partake. 'The director could not see how young men in this day and age could be expected to get excited about a wet fish,' explained Mandy Chang, who is making a film for Channel 4 about the new production. It will show both the documentary and the opera on Christmas Day and is happy to promote the new wave of operas. Last year it screened Powder Her Face by Thomas Ades and Phillip Hensher, an opera about the scandalous Duchess of Argyll which featured simulated scenes of fellatio. In December the youth opera Zoe, by John Lunn, will also be broadcast. This is a story which combines teacher/pupil sex, death, cloning and GM science and was written by Stephen Plaice, a regular writer on ITV drama series The Bill , who has also worked with inmates at Lewes Prison. The opera, which premiered to rave reviews this spring, was the result of a collaboration between professional and youth singers in Sussex. 'The students came from all over Sussex and had no interest in opera,' said Teresa Griffiths, who has just finished directing the film version of Zoe. 'But they are all stars now, and several of them are going on to drama school in London.' Plaice has gone on to work on a collaboration with the Royal Opera House on a youth opera for 13- and 14-year-olds involving schools in Croydon. A new English National Opera production of a little-known opera by Rossini, The Turk in Italy, which opened this week at The Coliseum in London, is further evidence of opera's fashionability.

My first memory of Johnny is going to a barbecue in a nearby village and this immensely scruffy little redheaded boy saying to me, 'Do you want to see my ferrets?' We banded together, roaming about the countryside and going to parties. I didn't have a crush on him, neither of us were each other's type, but I had a touch of hero worship - he could ride anything. <p>He went off to some strange places, jackerooing in Australia, while I went to university to study law. When he came back I had graduated and he started farming in Sussex and Kent, then moved north. About this time my drinking was kicking in.</p> <p>I isolated myself. Johnny saw me at the height of my drinking and was really sad about the state I'd got myself into. When I got sober, I didn't make much effort to get back in touch. I moved to Scotland about seven years ago, and one day Henry, my partner in the bookshop, told me we had a mutual friend. He dialled a number and handed me the telephone. I said, 'Hello, this is Clarissa, who is that?' and the other person, in a distinctive butterscotch voice said, 'Hello Petal.' Nobody else has ever called me Petal.</p> <p>Johnny was living about 20 minutes away from me on an 8,000-acre hill farm with 1,500 sheep, a wife Mary and two children. Johnny and I just picked up from where we left off as the closest of friends. When the BBC approached me about doing a countryside programme, I told them that I couldn't do it without Johnny. If he didn't translate well to camera, I wanted him as a consultant because he is the best countryman I know. Just as well, because I needed his support during filming. </p> <p>About a month before filming started last December, I was in Spain on holiday and my hernia tore. When we filmed the first day, I'd literally had stitches out the day before and I was feeling like shit. </p> <p>One of the first things that I was required to do for the show was walk six miles across a salt marsh in wellington boots, and Johnny was a brick. He just kept me laughing with his wonderfully witty sense of humour. </p> <p>Jennifer Paterson and I were brought together like the Spice Girls. I was fond of her but there were great difficulties working with her, especially in the afternoon. She liked to drink and it was hard representing a friendship that wasn't there. With Clarissa and the Countryman [BBC2, 8pm, starting Friday] it's the real thing.</p> <p><b>Johnny Scott:</b> The countryside was a Pandora's box of treasures for Clarissa. My upbringing was completely rural and I had all the things in life that she didn't. She was the most exuberant person I knew, so it was particularly sad to see her become so ill. Alcoholism is such a powerful illness and what causes it is terribly complex. In Clarissa's case, she was dreadfully upset at the death of her mother. Clarissa never married although she lived with someone for a number of years. He died tragically. </p> <p>Things were going desperately wrong for her - she'd given up a brilliant career as a barrister, she had terrible money problems and the last time I saw her before she got sober she was unrecognisable. I did fear she wasn't going to make it. Her courage saved her. When she called me a few years later, it was the same exuberant voice on the telephone telling me she was in Edinburgh. It was wonderful to have such a dear old friend living so close by. She had dried out and started to rebuild her life.</p> <p>She'd always had an interest in food and that led her to The Cooks Bookshop in Edinburgh. She soon became an authority on cooking. Anything she does with seafood is wonderful, and we share a love of British beef and game. Some time later came Two Fat Ladies.</p> <p>Clarissa has always been an enormously supportive friend and has the ability to think laterally. We often eat together, and go to the theatre.

      "byline": "William Leith",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A year ago, I read an article in the men's magazine GQ by the magazine's sex columnist, Kate Taylor. 'The editor called me into his office,' wrote Taylor, 'and said, \"Katy, this month your column goes dirty.\"'</p> <p>This was interesting, partly because I was fascinated to know how Kate Taylor felt about doing something that was sexually dirty, or, at any rate, dirtier than she would normally do, and partly because reading the article made me want to meet her and find out what kind of person she was. And, perhaps more importantly, something new seemed to be happening in the world of sex. Women were addressing men directly about their desires and experiences, in mainstream magazines. For years, if you wanted to read about women's intimate sexual feelings, you had to read books aimed at women, by authors such as Nancy Friday. Or you had to go to the top shelf, where you could find saucy articles purportedly written by women, but which had actually been written by men - pure fiction, in other words.</p> <p>But perhaps things were more complicated than they seemed. Were women really writing about their desires and experiences? Or were they writing about desires and experiences that men might enjoy reading about? Was this a good thing or a bad thing? Were they telling the truth? Here was Dylan Jones, a male editor, asking a female writer to have a certain type of sex. He wanted hard facts. 'It's totally legitimate, because that's something that personally I want to read about,' he tells me. 'And I hope our readers do, too.'</p> <p>The sex columns, which have been around for a handful of years, reflect a change in both men and women. There are four or five regularly covered topics: the fact that women like plenty of foreplay and have many erogenous zones; the fact that cunnilingus virtually guarantees an orgasm; the fact that having sex in unusual places, or in unusual positions, can be a turn on; the fact that illicit affairs are exciting; and the fact that anal sex, in the right circumstances, can be more than a remote fantasy. 'Six years ago,' says Anthony Noguera, editor of FHM, 'you wouldn't have seen a men's magazine covering anything to do with sex, because the whole point of men's magazines was to say, \"You're a \u00ba \u00aa great guy.\" The magazines didn't challenge their readers.'</p> <p>If something was happening to men, something was happening to women, too. They were becoming less reserved. In Sky magazine, you could read 'High priestess of perv' Karen Krizanovich. In Later, you could read Tracey Cox, the bestselling author of Hot Sex: How To Do It, and Rachel Lewis, who writes this month about 'The U Spot', which 'was discovered in 1988 by a research team at Northwestern University in Chicago'.</p> <p>Oliver James, the clinical psychologist and author of Britain on the Couch, says, 'The evidence is all there that woman are far more liberated than they ever were.' He believes that 'throughout the developed world, the number of partners of young women has been steadily increasing and the age at which they first have sex has decreased'. He also adds, 'It's quite obvious to me, from talking to younger women, that they are more libidinous, less hung up, and they don't see sex as this critical issue, like their grandmothers or their aunts did.' On the other hand, the negative conditioning, built up over centuries, has not disappeared overnight; according to research, women still 'fantasise less about sex' than men, they 'are less sexually explicit in their fantasies', and they 'focus more on the build-up than the climax'.</p> <p>Rowan Pelling, editor of The Erotic Review, writes her own column in GQ, under the heading Erotica. 'The thing about the lads' mags,' says Pelling, 'is they gave men a freedom to say, \"I no longer have to have an appropriate response.\" And that was a great freedom.' When magazines such as FHM and Loaded were launched, in other words, men were no longer expected to hide their lust. What had once been private had become public. Men could look at pictures of unclothed women on trains and buses.</p> <p>Pelling is not anti-pornography. 'Most standard pornography,' she says, 'is people having sex, and I just don't think sex is corrupting.' She sees herself as a member of an in-between generation of women - not an old-style feminist, and not part of 'the Ibiza generation'. She is 32, and comes across as a bit posh and old fashioned. She is not what you'd expect. She talks about sex with unjaded enthusiasm, as if she's a student writing a thesis on it. She's a libertarian, as long as people do whatever they do behind closed doors. At one point, she says, 'I pretty much subscribe to the argument that it's better to have sex with a sheep, probably, than to kill it and have it end up as mutton on your plate. I mean, from the sheep's point of view.' She thinks we should be more forgiving about affairs, like the French, and enjoyed the movies Showgirls and Romance. She says she found Romance, in which a girl has rape fantasies, 'all very psychologically accurate'. </p> <p>We meet in the West End offices of The Erotic Review, where a female editorial assistant is photocopying black-and-white illustrations of a woman baring her naked hindquarters to be spanked. Pelling says, 'Pornography, which is still made largely by men for men, still contains stuff that women don't find particularly interesting - massive orgies, baby oil. It's all about the thrust. There's very little foreplay. Most pornography is not tactile.'</p> <p>The Erotic Review is a journal of highbrow smut with quaintly lewd illustrations. There is a story in the summer issue by Gavanndra Hodge which goes, 'For me the library has always been one of the most erotically charged public spaces.' There is a cartoon strip featuring Egyptologists and frolicking lesbians. Politically, it is absolutely incorrect. </p> <p>Pelling's column, she tells me, is quite different from Taylor's. She says, 'I think Kate's column is practical and hands on. It's much more about sex that she has. There's an obvious difference with me, because I'm married. I think my column is written as a persona. I wouldn't be able to talk about my private life in the way that Kate does. Some people can and some people can't.'</p> <p>The Erotica column, she says, she would call 'advisory', while Taylor's is 'adventuresome'. Pelling says, 'You can only go two ways if you talk about your own experience. Either you write about disastrous stuff, which is necessarily embarrassing and humiliating for someone, or you write about something that's totally wonderful, and then you not only make people want to puke, but you also jeopardise something. It's the Hello! factor. If you say anything is good, I think you jeopardise it immediately.'</p> <p>In other words, it's hard to write the truth. The gay novelist Edmund White once told me that, whereas gay writers find it relatively easy to write about their sexual exploits, heterosexuals are always worried about embarrassing and shaming their sexual partners. Pelling tells me that she would never reveal anything about her own sex life with her husband Angus McKinnon, ex-editor of GQ. Her mother, she says, is broadly supportive of her career, but 'in the best possible scenario, she'd probably prefer it if I were doing something that wasn't so preoccupied with sex. She likes the fact that I write for The Spectator as well. That sort of cheers her up.'</p> <p>Pelling has no moral view on monogamy. She has just written a column on love triangles, which she thinks are prevalent, at least in people's minds. She says, 'If somebody asks, \"Is that true?\" the correct response is, \"Well, yes, of course it's true. It just may not have happened where I said it did, at that time, in that place, or in that order.\" I think the interesting thing about sex is that even if you said, \"I'm so frank, I write absolutely the truth,\" who's going to know unless they were in the bedroom? I wouldn't be surprised if what I wrote in a more veiled way weren't more truthful than the people writing total self-exposition.'</p> <p>She is from Kent, where her parents ran a pub. She has raunchily sensible attitudes to everything. She thinks people would benefit if their first sexual experience was with someone older and more experienced. She once wrote robustly about roaming around London looking for a brothel with Malcolm MacLaren. There are many problems facing the female sex columnist. First, you are dealing with a delicate subject, with gynaecology on one side and innuendo on the other. What will your partner think? Your ex-partners? Your parents? Also: will you be in some way tainted by the experience? </p> <p>Bibi Lynch, who writes for various publications, including Fiesta, says she'd like to referred to as a 'journalist and broadcaster'. Her days in the salt mines of writing sex columns are over, or at least numbered. These days, she is working on several TV pilots as a presenter. Her break came when she was reporting a comic item on a Radio 5 programme about orgasms on pop songs. Lynch persuaded Claire Rayner to rate the orgasms. An editor at Risque magazine heard the item, and Lynch's career as a sex writer was launched. She was, she was told, someone 'who could call a vagina a vagina'.</p> <p>But she didn't always write about her own experiences. 'If I fell out with people I'd certainly make sure they were in the features,' she says. Then she says, 'I'm joking.' At parties, she gets a bit sick of people who say, 'Here's Bibi - she's a porn queen.' She once covered a story for more! magazine on orgasm classes. 'It was horrific - a house in Norwood in south London, with social misfits talking about how to have orgasms for England.' For Lynch, writing about sex was a rung on the ladder. Now, like Krizanovich, she does not want to be too strongly identified as a sex writer. Lynch says, 'You do get sick of that sticky sex brush.'</p> <p>Anne Hooper, who has written 23 books about sex, including The Ultimate Sex Guide, tells me that, while 'women are discovering the ability to be free about sex for the first time, it's partly inhibition that's driving them to be so feisty'. Perhaps, having been repressed for centuries, women are going too far the other way. Hooper, who has also worked as a sex therapist, says, 'I probably know more about sex than any other writer in the country.' She's an expert on female anatomy. When she first began to write about the subject, there was 'shock and horror within my family. My father was a very straight British individual, a major in British intelligence during the war. But when The Ultimate Sex Guide became a bestseller, he was as pleased as anybody.'</p> <p>It is possible, Hooper believes, for women to write about sex in a way that is too feisty, too coarse. 'The minute things are only suggested or hinted at,' she says, 'that's more erotic. It's a mystery, a kind of labyrinth of sexuality you have to negotiate to find out what lies at the end.'</p> <p>What has happened, it seems, is something very simple. Women now feel free to tell men, in mainstream British publications, that they enjoy sex, that they fantasise about it, albeit in slightly different ways. They want to tell men about these different ways. And men like reading about it. Rachel Lewis, whose advice to men in this month's Later is, 'She'll be expecting you to start driving full pelt towards the main event by now, but instead of stamping on the accelerator, take a bit of time', says men respond to visual stimulation, whereas women are turned on by a more complex array of things. As Oliver James puts it in Britain on the Couch: 'Men are more explicit about sexual acts during fantasies.' And as Lewis adds, 'You wouldn't illustrate a women's sex article with pictures of naked men.'</p> <p>Tracey Cox, who was born in England but grew up in Australia, says, 'Men and women are similar in sex drive. But a woman's body is more complicated. It's harder to play. You've got to turn us on in so many different ways before it'll happen for us.' Cox is 38 and divorced. 'If I'd met and married Mr Wonderful at 21, what would I know about relationships?' she asks. 'My family,' she says, 'is fine about me writing about sex because I don't just write about sex.'</p> <p>Cox says, 'I thought Australia was uptight - until I came here.' In Australia, she tells me, the expression 'nice girls don't' refers to kinky things - it's assumed that everybody enjoys sex. 'We should all just relax about sex,' she says. She believes that women, as well as men, can have 'the best sex of your life' with 'somebody you couldn't care less about, because it doesn't matter if they judge you'.</p> <p>Her first sexual experience was disappointing. She was 16. 'I had it all organised,' she says. 'I had condoms. I knew about clitorises and orgasms, which most people don't at that age.' But sex education let her down. 'What I didn't realise is that people actually moved when they had intercourse. A year later I discovered sex properly.'</p> <p>Cox is forthright and sensible. She thinks we should be more like the Swedes, who are franker about sex, and have lower rates of sexually transmitted disease and unwanted pregnancy. She reckons that the ladette culture is silly: 'What's she proving? We know she can go down the pub and drink and bonk as many men as she wants. What's the point?' </p> <p>Talking about her column, Kate Taylor says, 'I was given a brief when I started. You've got to make them laugh. You've got to make them think. And you've got to give them a bit of a tingle.'</p> <p>We are in a wine bar. Taylor comes across as being a journalist who drifted into writing about sex, rather than a sex professional. 'It was never anything I planned to do,' she says. 'But I've got a smutty sense of humour. I haven't gone into it very professionally.' She started writing the column a couple of years ago, when James Brown was editing GQ. </p> <p>'I wrote a style piece on what men should wear in bed,' she says. In the piece, she wrote: </p> <p>'They should keep their pants on, because an unharnessed willy really makes its presence felt.' </p> <p>She could hear Brown laughing from his office, and the column was born.</p> <p>Taylor, who is not currently in a relationship, is 29. She says she sometimes writes about things that have happened to her, and sometimes about things that have happened to friends. 'I suppose it's like being this fantasy girlfriend, where I'm up for everything, and nothing's taboo,' she says. When she first tried to have sex as a teenager, 'I remember lying back and thinking, \"They write poems about this!\" But it got better.' Her mother, she says, likes her column 'when it's funny and about relationships. Dad doesn't read it'. </p> <p>Like all the other columnists, Taylor believes that women are fundamentally different from men. They may be just as horny, but 'I see it again and again, girlfriends saying, \"It was only a one-night stand, but he hasn't called.\" I think women pursuing men doesn't work. I think sex is one thing. Being feisty and up for it, that's fine. But I think relationships work out better still when the man pursues the woman.'</p> <p>When Dylan Jones asked her to have anal sex and write about it, he was asking her to do something much less dangerous and frightening than an editor who asks a reporter to cover a war or a riot. But this was not an example of a woman responding to her desires. It was an example of a woman being pursued. As it turned out, it was a legitimate exercise - the reader was made to think, to laugh and to tingle, and the reporter, as it turned out, enjoyed the assignment. </p> <p>What the female sex columnists are telling us is pretty clear. Nice girls do. And they like to do it in all sorts of ways. On top of this, though, men must listen to what women want and be gentle with them. Meeting Taylor, I find that she is not what I expected - she's nicer. She appears vulnerable. She does not, in some indefinable way, seem like someone who would write, 'I can orgasm on a pogo stick.' Which demonstrates the level of my prejudice. Like several of the others, Taylor doesn't expect to be a sex columnist for-ever. 'I've got an idea for a novel,' she says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A year ago, I read an article in the men's magazine GQ by the magazine's sex columnist, Kate Taylor. 'The editor called me into his office,' wrote Taylor, 'and said, \"Katy, this month your column goes dirty.\"' This was interesting, partly because I was fascinated to know how Kate Taylor felt about doing something that was sexually dirty, or, at any rate, dirtier than she would normally do, and partly because reading the article made me want to meet her and find out what kind of person she was. And, perhaps more importantly, something new seemed to be happening in the world of sex. Women were addressing men directly about their desires and experiences, in mainstream magazines. For years, if you wanted to read about women's intimate sexual feelings, you had to read books aimed at women, by authors such as Nancy Friday. Or you had to go to the top shelf, where you could find saucy articles purportedly written by women, but which had actually been written by men - pure fiction, in other words. But perhaps things were more complicated than they seemed. Were women really writing about their desires and experiences? Or were they writing about desires and experiences that men might enjoy reading about? Was this a good thing or a bad thing? Were they telling the truth? Here was Dylan Jones, a male editor, asking a female writer to have a certain type of sex. He wanted hard facts. 'It's totally legitimate, because that's something that personally I want to read about,' he tells me. 'And I hope our readers do, too.' The sex columns, which have been around for a handful of years, reflect a change in both men and women. There are four or five regularly covered topics: the fact that women like plenty of foreplay and have many erogenous zones; the fact that cunnilingus virtually guarantees an orgasm; the fact that having sex in unusual places, or in unusual positions, can be a turn on; the fact that illicit affairs are exciting; and the fact that anal sex, in the right circumstances, can be more than a remote fantasy. 'Six years ago,' says Anthony Noguera, editor of FHM, 'you wouldn't have seen a men's magazine covering anything to do with sex, because the whole point of men's magazines was to say, \"You're a \u00ba \u00aa great guy.\" The magazines didn't challenge their readers.' If something was happening to men, something was happening to women, too. They were becoming less reserved. In Sky magazine, you could read 'High priestess of perv' Karen Krizanovich. In Later, you could read Tracey Cox, the bestselling author of Hot Sex: How To Do It, and Rachel Lewis, who writes this month about 'The U Spot', which 'was discovered in 1988 by a research team at Northwestern University in Chicago'. Oliver James, the clinical psychologist and author of Britain on the Couch, says, 'The evidence is all there that woman are far more liberated than they ever were.' He believes that 'throughout the developed world, the number of partners of young women has been steadily increasing and the age at which they first have sex has decreased'. He also adds, 'It's quite obvious to me, from talking to younger women, that they are more libidinous, less hung up, and they don't see sex as this critical issue, like their grandmothers or their aunts did.' On the other hand, the negative conditioning, built up over centuries, has not disappeared overnight; according to research, women still 'fantasise less about sex' than men, they 'are less sexually explicit in their fantasies', and they 'focus more on the build-up than the climax'. Rowan Pelling, editor of The Erotic Review, writes her own column in GQ, under the heading Erotica. 'The thing about the lads' mags,' says Pelling, 'is they gave men a freedom to say, \"I no longer have to have an appropriate response.\" And that was a great freedom.' When magazines such as FHM and Loaded were launched, in other words, men were no longer expected to hide their lust. What had once been private had become public. Men could look at pictures of unclothed women on trains and buses. Pelling is not anti-pornography. 'Most standard pornography,' she says, 'is people having sex, and I just don't think sex is corrupting.' She sees herself as a member of an in-between generation of women - not an old-style feminist, and not part of 'the Ibiza generation'. She is 32, and comes across as a bit posh and old fashioned. She is not what you'd expect. She talks about sex with unjaded enthusiasm, as if she's a student writing a thesis on it. She's a libertarian, as long as people do whatever they do behind closed doors. At one point, she says, 'I pretty much subscribe to the argument that it's better to have sex with a sheep, probably, than to kill it and have it end up as mutton on your plate. I mean, from the sheep's point of view.' She thinks we should be more forgiving about affairs, like the French, and enjoyed the movies Showgirls and Romance. She says she found Romance, in which a girl has rape fantasies, 'all very psychologically accurate'. We meet in the West End offices of The Erotic Review, where a female editorial assistant is photocopying black-and-white illustrations of a woman baring her naked hindquarters to be spanked. Pelling says, 'Pornography, which is still made largely by men for men, still contains stuff that women don't find particularly interesting - massive orgies, baby oil. It's all about the thrust. There's very little foreplay. Most pornography is not tactile.' The Erotic Review is a journal of highbrow smut with quaintly lewd illustrations. There is a story in the summer issue by Gavanndra Hodge which goes, 'For me the library has always been one of the most erotically charged public spaces.' There is a cartoon strip featuring Egyptologists and frolicking lesbians. Politically, it is absolutely incorrect. Pelling's column, she tells me, is quite different from Taylor's. She says, 'I think Kate's column is practical and hands on. It's much more about sex that she has. There's an obvious difference with me, because I'm married. I think my column is written as a persona. I wouldn't be able to talk about my private life in the way that Kate does. Some people can and some people can't.' The Erotica column, she says, she would call 'advisory', while Taylor's is 'adventuresome'. Pelling says, 'You can only go two ways if you talk about your own experience. Either you write about disastrous stuff, which is necessarily embarrassing and humiliating for someone, or you write about something that's totally wonderful, and then you not only make people want to puke, but you also jeopardise something. It's the Hello! factor. If you say anything is good, I think you jeopardise it immediately.' In other words, it's hard to write the truth.

      "body": "<p>Those three little words no one wants to hear: you have cancer. The depth of the dread is probably why so many of us know so little about it, preferring to muck around with myths and half-truths. Both my parents had it. My wife is fully recovered from a skin melanoma. One of my best friends survived bowel cancer in his mid-twenties. And still my ignorance was wilfully deep.</p> <p>Nor is it just us civilians who feel that way. 'Even the medical profession hides from the truth,' the doctor in our family told me.</p> <p>'I had an old and highly respected Harley Street specialist come to me and say he'd had bleeding from his rectum for some time - what might be wrong? Of course he knew it was colorectal cancer. He just didn't want to know. And when you tell people they have cancer, they ask as few questions as possible.'</p> <p>So let's tackle the questions we all find so hard to ask - and uncover the truth behind some of our myths.</p> <p><b> 1 You can catch it just like you catch a cold </b></p> <p>No, it's not a droplet disease. Nor is it water-borne like, say, cholera. But it's possible to catch diseases and viruses which can lead to it. Around 15 per cent of cancers worldwide are caused this way. Cervical cancer, for example, is virtually always (99.7 per cent) a consequence of HPV, a sexually transmitted infection. Liver cancer is 100 times more likely in hepatitis B victims - which is why it's one of the few cancers where the Third World has a lead over us. The major risk factor is that babies are infected by their mothers.</p> <p><b> 2 Flying gives you leukaemia</b></p> <p>Only if you are a long-term commercial pilot - in which case you are five times more likely to get it. The effect is related to the high number of hours flown and only applies to those who have put in more than 5,000 hours. Even serial business flyers like Rupert Murdoch don't rack up hours like that, so it's a purely professional risk. It's most likely caused by cosmic radiation which increases with altitude. So the higher you fly, the more marked the effect - presumably Concorde pilots ran (or flew) the greatest risk. The link was established by Dr Hans Storm of the Institute of Epidemiology, Copenhagen. 'The only way to avoid it,' he said, 'would be to limit the number of hours pilots are allowed to fly, just as they do with nuclear workers.' Airline pilots are also three times as likely to get skin cancer, but that's because they take more holidays in the sun.</p> <p><b> 3 City life gives you cancer</b></p> <p>No, there is no difference in incidence rate between our towns and our countryside. The same doesn't seem to be true, though, for survival rates. An Aberdeen University study found that rural Scots with stomach cancer were four times more likely to die before it was diagnosed. For breast cancer, it's three times. Why? Because country dwellers have worse access to specialist care than their town cousins.</p> <p><b> 4 It's man-made chemicals that are to blame</b></p> <p>Not really. Epidemiologists look elsewhere for the causes, by and large. The BMA estimates that 1 per cent of cancers are caused by food additives. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) says no more than 1 per cent of all cancers are a result of man-made chemicals. It's true that a 1999 German report and a more recent one by the US Environmental Protection Agency pointed the finger at dioxins, even coming up with a figure of their being responsible for 12 per cent of human cancers in industrialised countries. Other scientists, while not disputing that dioxins are poisonous, doubt that they are ingested in sufficient quantities and point out that there is no causal link evidence. There is no real evidence of increased cancers in Seveso, site of the worst dioxin exposure and the much-vaunted leukaemia link with water pollution in Worcester, Massachusetts - as recounted in the movie A Civil Action - is almost certainly false. Staggeringly, a majority of US citizens, when polled by the Discovery Channel, said they thought air pollution carried as big a cancer risk as heavy smoking. That's pretty much on a level with thinking the moon's made of green cheese. Still, maybe it's no coincidence. Believing some nasty big business out there is to blame for cancer has two advantages - it stops being your responsibility and, perhaps more importantly in the lawyer-heavy US, it affords you the opportunity to sue the bejaysus out of them.</p> <p><b> 5 There is more and more and more of it around</b></p> <p>Well, yes, but this is mostly because more of us live longer. It's overwhelmingly a disease of age - nearly two-thirds of all cancers occur in the over-65s. Also, fewer of us are dying of other diseases - and, death being death, we've all got to die of something. Still, even the age-standardised rates have risen. From 1971 to 1997, levels rose 13 per cent in men and 34 per cent in women. More recently, though, there has been a significant decline in male cancer - down 5.75 per cent since 1994. This is probably because of the long-term drop in lung- cancer rates - down 33 per cent from 1986 to 1997. Female cancers, though, have risen a little recently, but they're still below their 1992 peak. In the US, by the way, it's fallen even faster - 10 per cent down overall since the 1992 peak.</p> <p><b> 6 Every second person seems to have it</b></p> <p>Almost. In the US, 48 per cent and 37 per cent of women will get cancer at some point during their life. The UK figure is a little lower. According to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF), just over one in three will get it, one in four will die of it. Currently, the male five-year survival rate is just 31 per cent, while the female is 43 per cent. Five years is the cancer experts' preferred definition of 'survival'.</p> <p><b> 7 There was some blood in my stools for a bit, but then it stopped, so I haven't got cancer</b></p> <p>Maybe, maybe not. Cancerous polyps do bleed intermittently.</p> <p><b> 8 Cervical cancer is a promiscuity thing</b></p> <p>Afraid so. The younger a woman is when she first has sex and the more sexual partners she has in her lifetime, the greater her chance of getting cervical cancer. That's because it's one of the few cancers caused by something you can catch. More than 99 per cent of women who get it have the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Male promiscuity is also a major cause - women who've only had one partner also get HPV. Male promiscuity, combined with lower hygiene levels, is often the problem in the Third World - men catch HPV from prostitutes and infect their wives and lovers. Colombia, for example, has the world's highest rate. There is an HPV test, but trials have had varying results. In some, it's proved accurate. In others, it has produced a number of both false-positives and false-negatives - though the trials weren't large enough to establish whether the numbers were unacceptably large. As recently as September 1999, Dr Peter Sasieni of the ICRF said that adding it routinely 'would certainly lead to greatly increased costs without necessarily significantly decreasing the amount of cancers'. However, both he and the ICRF now believe 'that HPV testing holds great promise as a primary screening method. It has an abnormality detection rate of about 90 per cent compared to 75 or less for a smear test.' Currently, it's being tested on borderline cases - still 250,000 a year. Cervical screening is already working. It cut cases by 42 per cent between 1988 and 1997, and deaths have fallen by 50 per cent in the last 15 years.</p> <p><b> 9 Male circumcision prevents cervical cancer</b></p> <p>There is some evidence for this. In India, Muslim women have a lower rate of cervical cancer than Hindus and Christians. It certainly seems to prevent penile cancer, which is virtually never seen in circumcised men.</p> <p><b> 10 I've got genital warts: that means cervical cancer somewhere down the line, right?</b></p> <p>Almost certainly not. When it comes to cervical cancer, if you can see the problem with the naked eye, it means you haven't got a problem. Nasty but true. More than 60 variants of HPV have been identified. Genital warts are produced by HPV Types 6 and 11, which have no link with cervical cancer. The danger ones are HPV 16, 18, 33, 35 and 45. The big problem is they're mostly 'silent'. Many of us have these HPVs, very few of us know it - a big deal when your chances with cervical cancer are directly related to the disease's progress by the time of diagnosis. Have a pap smear, basically. Because, in the words of the American National Cancer Institute, 'properly treated, tumour control of cervical cancer should be nearly 100 per cent.'</p> <p><b> 11 Extremely overweight people are more likely to develop it</b></p> <p>Some American sources say there is a connection between obesity and cancer. The ICRF says the link is not clear. There are two exceptions, though. Obese women are three to five times more likely to get endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer and obese post-menopausal women run an increased risk of breast cancer.</p> <p><b> 12 More men die of testicular cancer than women do of breast cancer</b></p> <p>Not so. Testicular cancer is a very rare disease. It accounts for just one per cent of male cancers - in England and Wales in 1999, 71 died of it, compared to the 11,548 women who died of breast cancer. Incidence has doubled over the last 20 years - though it may now be on the decline since a 1996 peak. It is one of the few cancers that attacks the young. Nine out of 10 cases are in under-55s - and non-descended testicles by the age of seven is a strong indicator for it. The survival rate is excellent, however - almost 95 per cent.</p> <p><b> 13 OK then, more men die of prostate cancer than women of breast cancer</b></p> <p>Wrong again, though the figures are a little closer. Breast cancer is the leading killer disease for women between 35 and 54. According to the Office for National Statistics, the lifetime risk is one in nine. Prostate cancer, by contrast, is a one in 14 shot - still 10,000 deaths a year, with a 41 per cent survival rate. Breast cancer survival rates are rapidly improving, though. It kills some 13,000 British women a year, of the 35,000 who develop it. But that is far better than it was. Since the late 80s, when we had one of the lowest survival rates in Europe, deaths have fallen by 30 per cent, faster than anywhere else in the world. That was from a very high starting point, though, so more women are still dying in Britain than in America, Australia and some of Europe.</p> <p><b> 14 Breast cancer is killing more and more young women</b></p> <p>Definitely not. Death rates have been reduced by 30 per cent in young and middle-aged victims - mostly because of the efficacy of tamoxifen, a cheap and effective drug which blocks hormone receptors on cancer cells, interfering with their growth. It probably saves more lives than any other form of non-surgical cancer treatment. In younger women, chemotherapy after surgery has made a bid difference to death rates.</p> <p><b> 15 Left-handers are more likely to get breast cancer, so are virgins</b></p> <p>Yes and yes. The left-hand difference - which is 'modest' - was reported in the journal Epidemiology. A suggestion is that there is a link to the hypothesis that intrauterine exposure to steroid hormones may play a role in the development of breast cancer, as well as influencing handedness. Virgins are more likely to get it because they don't have children. Breast cancer is closely linked to oestrogen levels. Asian women in Asia, for example, have low levels of both -and British women high ones. Having babies, particularly when you're young, lowers the risk. By contrast, the fewer children you have, the greater your risk. Other risks are late menopause and having a first child after 30 - the older you are, the greater the danger. According to Dr Hilakivi-Clarke of the AICR, it now seems that the impact of high oestrogen levels varies through a woman's life. In the reproductive years, they have no effect at all. In the womb and after menopause, they increase the risk. During childhood, they now appear to play a 'powerful protective role'.</p> <p><b> 16 Routine mammograms are a waste of time for over-65s</b></p> <p>No, says the US. Yes, said the ICRF till just the other week - 'There is no good medical reason to justify the decision.' No, it now says. In the last week of September, the government announced that routine screening would be extended to 65- to 70-year-olds by 2004.</p> <p><b> 17 I've got a painful lump in my breast, so I must have cancer</b></p> <p>Most likely not - 90 per cent of breast cancer tumours are not painful, according to a clinician. It is far more likely to be an abscess, which is then always painful.</p> <p><b> 18 Every man, if he lived long enough, would eventually get prostate cancer</b></p> <p>Probably. The death toll has doubled over the last 20 years, and in 20 years' time, 50,000 men a year will get it. According to Dr Peter Sasieni, statistician for the ICRF, 40 per cent of all 80-year-old men have it - this was established through post-mortems. Many won't know they've got it, as it develops slowly and they'll die of something else first. 'You can assume that the incidence increases with age. So if men lived to over 120 or so, it is possible they would all get prostate cancer.' But not necessarily die of it. It looks as if there could well be a form of prostate cancer that just sits there and grows very slowly.</p> <p><b> 19 The PSA test has transformed the survival rate for prostate cancer</b></p> <p>The jury's out on this. In the US, prostate cancer deaths have dropped 10 per cent since the early 90s - both experts and patient groups attribute this to the prostate-specific antigen test (PSA) which is a simple blood test. Experts here are nowhere near as convinced, pointing out the test's low accuracy level - it produces an unacceptable number of both false-positives and false-negatives. One of the big problems is figuring out whether a tumour is aggressive or not. New research seems to have pinpointed the eight genes which are responsible for the disease.</p> <p><b> 20 Black Americans are more likely to get prostate cancer than whites</b></p> <p>True. No one knows why.</p> <p><b> 21 There's this Chinese herb stuff which really zaps prostate cancer</b></p> <p>Absolutely. Western researchers call it PC-SPES. It's an over-the-counter powder supplement with eight different plants in it: isatis, liquorice, lucid ganoderma, pseudo-ginseng, rubescens, saw palmetto and scute. Research is at an early stage, but when rats on PC-SPES were injected with cancer cells, only 60 per cent of them got tumours - compared to the usual 99. Lab tests by Dr Jan Geliebter of New York Medical College further showed that PC-SPES 'strongly inhibits' the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture.</p> <p><b> 22 So vegetarians get less cancer</b></p> <p>No. Eating five portions of fruit and veg a day - whether you're a carnivore, a vegetarian or a vegan - is the thing that could keep Mr C away, or at least make him less likely to come calling. For 20 years, experts have pointed out that red meat and saturated fats are laden with the bad stuff - the chemicals that kick off the process which leads to cancer - while the good stuff is in fruit and vegetables: phytochemicals and antioxidants which fight it. The conclusion propounded was that meat-eating was the problem. Not so. A recent piece of research by the ICRF found that vegetarians are just as likely to die of bowel cancer as meat eaters. Nor was there any difference in breast, prostate, lung or stomach cancer. 'Our analysis suggests that meat itself may have little effect on the development of the disease,' says the ICRF's Dr Timothy Key - a fairly categorical statement by scientific standards. Another study, by the US National Cancer Institute, found that people on a low-fat, high-fibre diet seemed to stand as much chance of developing pre-cancerous growths in their colons as those who steaked up and burgered out. But it's hard to know what to read into that. Questions are definitely begged. What do pre-cancerous growths, for example, have to say about cancerous ones? And what about cancers outside the colon? Still, a recent AICR expert review of 247 studies found that 78 per cent showed that vegetables and fruit protected against cancer. So best keep having salad with those chips.</p> <p><b> 23 Garlic beats cancer</b></p> <p>A recent study-review by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) suggests that those who regularly eat garlic - raw or cooked - run half the risk of stomach cancer and two-thirds the risk of colon cancer. The AICR recommends eating two to five cloves a week or taking garlic supplements, though the UNC-CH found no benefit in supplements. Why does garlic help? The suggestion is it's because it attacks helicobacter pylori which is closely linked to stomach cancer.</p> <p><b> 24 Fruit juice stops you getting cancer </b></p> <p>It probably helps. A glass of juice counts as one portion of the five a day of fruit and vegetables that the WHO and other experts say will lower your risk. For these purposes, by the way, potatoes and nuts don't count as vegetables.</p> <p><b> 25 Vegans, then. They get less cancer</b></p> <p>They certainly have lower levels of IGF-I - Insulin-like Growth Factor-I - which increases the risk of prostate cancer. 'Even small differences are predictive,' says Dr Timothy Key. Low levels are found in places where little meat or dairy products are eaten. An ICRF study revealed that IGF-I levels are 9 per cent lower in vegans than in meat eaters. However, says an epidemiologist, 'studies with big leaps of faith - the technical term is \"proxy outcomes\" - from a chemical to a disease don't get me too excited.'</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,382676,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Read the second part of Truths and myths here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Those three little words no one wants to hear: you have cancer. The depth of the dread is probably why so many of us know so little about it, preferring to muck around with myths and half-truths. Both my parents had it. My wife is fully recovered from a skin melanoma. One of my best friends survived bowel cancer in his mid-twenties. And still my ignorance was wilfully deep. Nor is it just us civilians who feel that way. 'Even the medical profession hides from the truth,' the doctor in our family told me. 'I had an old and highly respected Harley Street specialist come to me and say he'd had bleeding from his rectum for some time - what might be wrong? Of course he knew it was colorectal cancer. He just didn't want to know. And when you tell people they have cancer, they ask as few questions as possible.' So let's tackle the questions we all find so hard to ask - and uncover the truth behind some of our myths. 1 You can catch it just like you catch a cold No, it's not a droplet disease. Nor is it water-borne like, say, cholera. But it's possible to catch diseases and viruses which can lead to it. Around 15 per cent of cancers worldwide are caused this way. Cervical cancer, for example, is virtually always (99.7 per cent) a consequence of HPV, a sexually transmitted infection. Liver cancer is 100 times more likely in hepatitis B victims - which is why it's one of the few cancers where the Third World has a lead over us. The major risk factor is that babies are infected by their mothers. 2 Flying gives you leukaemia Only if you are a long-term commercial pilot - in which case you are five times more likely to get it. The effect is related to the high number of hours flown and only applies to those who have put in more than 5,000 hours. Even serial business flyers like Rupert Murdoch don't rack up hours like that, so it's a purely professional risk. It's most likely caused by cosmic radiation which increases with altitude. So the higher you fly, the more marked the effect - presumably Concorde pilots ran (or flew) the greatest risk. The link was established by Dr Hans Storm of the Institute of Epidemiology, Copenhagen. 'The only way to avoid it,' he said, 'would be to limit the number of hours pilots are allowed to fly, just as they do with nuclear workers.' Airline pilots are also three times as likely to get skin cancer, but that's because they take more holidays in the sun. 3 City life gives you cancer No, there is no difference in incidence rate between our towns and our countryside. The same doesn't seem to be true, though, for survival rates. An Aberdeen University study found that rural Scots with stomach cancer were four times more likely to die before it was diagnosed. For breast cancer, it's three times. Why? Because country dwellers have worse access to specialist care than their town cousins. 4 It's man-made chemicals that are to blame Not really. Epidemiologists look elsewhere for the causes, by and large. The BMA estimates that 1 per cent of cancers are caused by food additives. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) says no more than 1 per cent of all cancers are a result of man-made chemicals. It's true that a 1999 German report and a more recent one by the US Environmental Protection Agency pointed the finger at dioxins, even coming up with a figure of their being responsible for 12 per cent of human cancers in industrialised countries. Other scientists, while not disputing that dioxins are poisonous, doubt that they are ingested in sufficient quantities and point out that there is no causal link evidence.

It's overwhelmingly a disease of age - nearly two-thirds of all cancers occur in the over-65s. Also, fewer of us are dying of other diseases - and, death being death, we've all got to die of something. Still, even the age-standardised rates have risen. From 1971 to 1997, levels rose 13 per cent in men and 34 per cent in women. More recently, though, there has been a significant decline in male cancer - down 5.75 per cent since 1994. This is probably because of the long-term drop in lung- cancer rates - down 33 per cent from 1986 to 1997. Female cancers, though, have risen a little recently, but they're still below their 1992 peak. In the US, by the way, it's fallen even faster - 10 per cent down overall since the 1992 peak. 6 Every second person seems to have it Almost. In the US, 48 per cent and 37 per cent of women will get cancer at some point during their life. The UK figure is a little lower. According to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF), just over one in three will get it, one in four will die of it. Currently, the male five-year survival rate is just 31 per cent, while the female is 43 per cent. Five years is the cancer experts' preferred definition of 'survival'. 7 There was some blood in my stools for a bit, but then it stopped, so I haven't got cancer Maybe, maybe not. Cancerous polyps do bleed intermittently. 8 Cervical cancer is a promiscuity thing Afraid so. The younger a woman is when she first has sex and the more sexual partners she has in her lifetime, the greater her chance of getting cervical cancer. That's because it's one of the few cancers caused by something you can catch. More than 99 per cent of women who get it have the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Male promiscuity is also a major cause - women who've only had one partner also get HPV. Male promiscuity, combined with lower hygiene levels, is often the problem in the Third World - men catch HPV from prostitutes and infect their wives and lovers. Colombia, for example, has the world's highest rate. There is an HPV test, but trials have had varying results. In some, it's proved accurate. In others, it has produced a number of both false-positives and false-negatives - though the trials weren't large enough to establish whether the numbers were unacceptably large.

However, both he and the ICRF now believe 'that HPV testing holds great promise as a primary screening method. It has an abnormality detection rate of about 90 per cent compared to 75 or less for a smear test.' Currently, it's being tested on borderline cases - still 250,000 a year. Cervical screening is already working. It cut cases by 42 per cent between 1988 and 1997, and deaths have fallen by 50 per cent in the last 15 years. 9 Male circumcision prevents cervical cancer There is some evidence for this. In India, Muslim women have a lower rate of cervical cancer than Hindus and Christians. It certainly seems to prevent penile cancer, which is virtually never seen in circumcised men. 10 I've got genital warts: that means cervical cancer somewhere down the line, right? Almost certainly not. When it comes to cervical cancer, if you can see the problem with the naked eye, it means you haven't got a problem. Nasty but true. More than 60 variants of HPV have been identified. Genital warts are produced by HPV Types 6 and 11, which have no link with cervical cancer. The danger ones are HPV 16, 18, 33, 35 and 45. The big problem is they're mostly 'silent'. Many of us have these HPVs, very few of us know it - a big deal when your chances with cervical cancer are directly related to the disease's progress by the time of diagnosis. Have a pap smear, basically. Because, in the words of the American National Cancer Institute, 'properly treated, tumour control of cervical cancer should be nearly 100 per cent.' 11 Extremely overweight people are more likely to develop it Some American sources say there is a connection between obesity and cancer. The ICRF says the link is not clear. There are two exceptions, though. Obese women are three to five times more likely to get endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer and obese post-menopausal women run an increased risk of breast cancer. 12 More men die of testicular cancer than women do of breast cancer Not so. Testicular cancer is a very rare disease. It accounts for just one per cent of male cancers - in England and Wales in 1999, 71 died of it, compared to the 11,548 women who died of breast cancer.

The conclusion propounded was that meat-eating was the problem. Not so. A recent piece of research by the ICRF found that vegetarians are just as likely to die of bowel cancer as meat eaters. Nor was there any difference in breast, prostate, lung or stomach cancer. 'Our analysis suggests that meat itself may have little effect on the development of the disease,' says the ICRF's Dr Timothy Key - a fairly categorical statement by scientific standards. Another study, by the US National Cancer Institute, found that people on a low-fat, high-fibre diet seemed to stand as much chance of developing pre-cancerous growths in their colons as those who steaked up and burgered out. But it's hard to know what to read into that. Questions are definitely begged. What do pre-cancerous growths, for example, have to say about cancerous ones? And what about cancers outside the colon? Still, a recent AICR expert review of 247 studies found that 78 per cent showed that vegetables and fruit protected against cancer. So best keep having salad with those chips. 23 Garlic beats cancer A recent study-review by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) suggests that those who regularly eat garlic - raw or cooked - run half the risk of stomach cancer and two-thirds the risk of colon cancer. The AICR recommends eating two to five cloves a week or taking garlic supplements, though the UNC-CH found no benefit in supplements. Why does garlic help? The suggestion is it's because it attacks helicobacter pylori which is closely linked to stomach cancer. 24 Fruit juice stops you getting cancer It probably helps. A glass of juice counts as one portion of the five a day of fruit and vegetables that the WHO and other experts say will lower your risk. For these purposes, by the way, potatoes and nuts don't count as vegetables. 25 Vegans, then. They get less cancer They certainly have lower levels of IGF-I - Insulin-like Growth Factor-I - which increases the risk of prostate cancer. 'Even small differences are predictive,' says Dr Timothy Key. Low levels are found in places where little meat or dairy products are eaten. An ICRF study revealed that IGF-I levels are 9 per cent lower in vegans than in meat eaters. However, says an epidemiologist, 'studies with big leaps of faith - the technical term is \"proxy outcomes\" - from a chemical to a disease don't get me too excited.'

      "body": "<p>My grandmother never set foot in a bank in her entire life. Living in rural Ireland on next to nothing, it was never really an issue. By the next generation down, my family had migrated up the social scale as far as central heating and a colour telly, but not so far as home ownership or bank accounts. Anything beyond the basics was acquired slowly ('85 weeks at 50p!') and paid for in cash out of weekly brown envelopes.</p> <p>Definitions of affluence are always relative, but in recent history we've used the previous generation as the benchmark. By that definition, I'm doing just fine. I have a nice house, a people-carrier car and multiple bank accounts. I often have money left over when my bills have been paid, which I spend on taxis and restaurants and a cleaner. But the nice house comes with a big mortgage, the people carrier is six years old, and the multiple bank accounts are a necessity for moving debt around rather than paying it off.</p> <p>I earn a professional-level salary - more in one year than my dad earned in five - and I never have enough money. Right now the things I can't afford include: a new computer for my self, a flute (\u00a3400) for my daughter, an extra bedroom, an extra bathroom, and one of those fabulous walk-in wardrobes. It's an extravagant list of things I want rather than need, but what does 'need' mean after an eight-year economic boom, and five decades in which the whole country has grown steadily richer?</p> <p>Between the 40s and the 90s, incomes in the UK have almost trebled in real terms, but we don't feel richer. The overheated housing market, student fees, the vagaries of 'rip-off Britain' and the audacious cost of designer trainers for 11-year-olds conspire to keep us on the wrong side of solvent. For the past four years, we've been spending more than we earn, drawing heavily on savings and share income to keep up, while the amount of consumer credit outstanding is currently around \u00a3600 billion - equivalent to more than \u00a310,000 for every adult in the country.</p> <p>Nor do we feel happier. Research by Andrew Oswald, professor of economics at Warwick University, shows that our reported levels of happiness are remarkably unaffected by our affluence, and lower than in many less well-off countries. So, how much do we need to earn to feel comfortably off? And why are we knocking ourselves out with the longest working week in Europe if the money it makes us doesn't even cheer us up?</p> <p>Part of the problem is that most of this new affluence is increasingly weighted towards a very small proportion of the population - the already rich. According to research carried out by John Hills from the London School of Economics, income became more unevenly distributed during the 90s than at any time since the Second World War. While fat cats and dot.com squillionaires are apparently multiplying at a depressing rate, they form only a tiny elite. My inadequate professional income puts me in the top 20 per cent of wage earners in the country. The average household income in the UK is only just over \u00a320,000 (and that's income, including benefits, investments and pensions, not just salary), and one in five working-age people live on less than half of that. Many of us don't feel richer because we aren't.</p> <p>But the rest of us don't have that excuse. We know that we're living lives of unprecedented affluence, even as we struggle to keep up with our desires and aspirations. I have more money than my dad ever did, but nowhere near as much as my sister, and that's the problem. The generational benchmark no longer applies. Instead, according to Oswald, we look over our shoulders at our neighbours, friends and colleagues. How are we doing compared to them? If we're satisfied there, we scale up, comparing ourselves to the characters in films and on TV, or to Posh and Becks. When Wallace Simpson said that you couldn't be too rich or too thin, she hit on a bitter, bitter truth. There's always someone who is richer or thinner.</p> <p>But even that doesn't fully explain our odd disaffection with our finances. Fifty years of growing affluence has precipitated and mirrored 50 years of the fastest and most far-reaching social and cultural change in history. Our attitudes to fundamentals like saving and debt have been transformed in the space of a single generation. New ways of working, living and thinking have created new economic models and attitudes.</p> <p>The new economy is still more hype and hypothesis than it is reality, but it's a stone in a pond, and the ripples are spreading. New, technology-driven occupations are producing a working model where old career and pay structures don't apply. Like Nicola Evans, who works in IT, and headhunter Paul Gattaora, (interviewed below,) young people can head companies, run teams, be promoted three times and earn huge salaries, all within a few years of leaving college. All they have to do in return is work themselves into the ground.</p> <p>This creates new social and spending models of its own. The hundreds of thousands of homes that need to be built over the next decade are not for families, but for young professional singles like Nicola and Philip McQueen, who works in the pharmaceuticals industry (see below). The huge boom in domestic labour - cleaners, gardeners, caterers and concierge services who will water your plants and pick up your dry cleaning - is being fed by a rising tide of cash-rich, time-poor professionals, not by ladies who lunch.</p> <p>It's a high-pressure life, and even the high salaries aren't always enough to sustain it. Paul, Nicola and Philip all talked about working hard now and getting out early. They may be fooling themselves - pension planning and saving remain woefully inadequate in the UK, and a high-income life can be an inescapable trap. But in their life plans, the old pattern of 40-year careers is being condensed into half that. What happens to them - and the wider economy - if they all bow out of the labour market at 45 or 50 is a script that's still being written.</p> <p>Those with average salaries or more traditional careers aren't exempt from the long-hours culture, or from the relentless need to spend to keep up. The large number of mothers in the workforce, and the rise of the two-career couple, means we're all caught in the same time-squeeze.</p> <p>All of which creates a totally new kind of consumer, and a new raft of sales opportunities in the global shopping mall. In the marketing departments of every major 'brand' on earth, budgets are being doubled and strategies created specifically to target this new consumer group with enough clothes, records and techie toys to last them a lifetime, and who really need never buy anything much again. They are cynical about advertising, don't like being sold to and don't have time to shop. So the marketeers don't sell them things, but experiences and time. That bubble bath isn't a glass jar full of water and chemicals, it's an hour of precious downtime. Those walking boots aren't boots, they're an alternative identity as a free, country dwelling, outdoors man-of-action. Exhausted, tunnel-visioned and isolated, the new consumers spend money like water, buying a facsimile of everything they're missing while they spend all those hours at work - like time, nurture, and fresh air.</p> <p>And even if you can remain immune to the lure of labels and 'experience marketing', your kids will succumb on your behalf. As parents Janet Whitton and John Kelleher attest, having children changes everything, and not just because they cost a lot and give you new and previously unimagined things to worry about. Providing what they want now is only the start of it. Deposits for houses (because no one can afford one without parental help), the cost of higher education, and planning for your own retirement so as not to become a financial burden, put even good incomes under an impossible strain. I'd like to retire at 50 myself, but my daughter will only be 20 then and hopefully spending my money on text books and student accommodation.</p> <p>Many parents are now looking at supporting their children, at least partially, well into their twenties or even thirties. This may explain the rising tide of national debt, our new-found tolerance for it, and the parallel rise in the number of couples electing to skip those 30 years of anguish and expense all together and remain childless. The way we spend our money reveals not just our lifestyles, but our natures, our values, our fears, and our national identity. Money has become the way we express ourselves, demonstrate love, and compensate ourselves for the high price of achieving it. No wonder we feel as if we've never got enough of it.</p> <p><b>Janet Whitton (\u00a319,000)</b><br> 45, married, teacher with three children (husband owns his own business), lives in Berkshire</p> <p>When Janet Whitton had her first child 14 years ago, she gave up her job as an air stewardess to be a full-time mother. It was a privilege - her husband earned enough to support them all - and her choice. It was also one of the hardest things she'd ever done.</p> <p>'I loved being with the baby, but I had a hard time not having my own income. For my generation of women, economic independence was a guiding principle. I found that I felt completely differently about myself. I've never been very money-orientated or materialistic, but for the first time I began to think about money a lot.' Four years ago, with her children growing up, she trained as a teacher. 'It's not a huge salary, obviously, but it makes an enormous difference to me.' Her husband pays the mortgage and the bills, while Janet buys the family's food 'about \u00a3400 a month'.</p> <p>When she was younger 'and miserable', she ran up her credit cards to a point where things got painful. 'I realised I was trying to salve my misery with shopping.' These days, she's happy, and a model of financial propriety. Credit cards are paid off every month, and although she sometimes makes it to payday by the skin of her teeth, she doesn't get overdrawn. 'My salary is adequate because my husband can afford to pay the biggest bills, but I feel for my fellow teachers. The young ones are paying off student loans, and will be for years.'</p> <p>A significant proportion of Janet's salary goes on buying teaching materials for her class. 'I spent about \u00a360 in August on maths sets, models, all that kind of stuff. Nobody makes me do it, but I want the kids to have the best resources, and I don't want to put the school under an impossible strain. I don't resent it at all. That's my choice.' She also buys bits and pieces for the house. 'I'm paying \u00a345 a month for two leather sofas'; '\u00a3210 a month for a year-old Rover 200'; and she buys clothes for the children.</p> <p>'That's my biggest financial headache. I buy my own clothes from Gap or Laura Ashley, but my daughter only wants designer labels.' Like all children, Janet's are sophisticated and relentless consumers, 'they are so susceptible to advertising and peer pressure, and they put enormous pressure on their parents in turn. It's all Calvin Klein and DKNY, and I really resent it.' But she does give in. 'More than I should. It becomes so important to them.'</p> <p>Andrew Oswald's reflection on all definitions of affluence being relative is completely realised in Janet's situation. 'We live in Berkshire. I can drive a couple of miles in one direction to the school where I work, and see people who are genuinely in need. One child won a merit badge for sports, and we asked the parents to contribute 75p for the cost of the badge. I had a note sent back explaining that they couldn't afford it.' But she can drive a few miles in the opposite direction and she's bang in the middle of the Home Counties commuter belt. 'The houses are worth five, six million. And then I suddenly feel quite poor.'</p> <p>According to Karen Rowlingson, a lecturer in social policy at the University of Bath, this 360-degree vision makes Janet unusually well balanced. 'Most of us tend to mix only with our own peer group, and that's how we decide if we're financially comfortable or not. Some people are very well off by national standards and just don't feel it, because they've got no idea of how the rest of the country lives.' Janet agrees. 'I think we're fine. We're about the right-sized fish for our own pond. In an ideal world, I'd like \u00a320k a year without having to work for it, but that's just dreaming. My neighbour won \u00a3120,000 on the Lottery and I wasn't remotely jealous - just delighted for them. But I've started doing the Lottery now.'</p> <p>When Janet worries about money, it's about the future, not the present. 'I want for both my husband and I to retire young - early fifties - and then have time and money to travel. But I don't know whether we'll be able to; we don't really save, apart from pensions.' Like most people in the South East, she's invested her hopes in the runaway housing market. 'I'm hoping we'll have enough equity in the house to help.' She already has money put aside for the children's education. 'Otherwise I'd be worried sick. We're reaching a point with loans and fees where working-class kids will be barred from higher education again. That is desperately sad.'</p> <p><b>John Kelleher (\u00a335,000 + bonus )</b><br>53, married, shopping-centre manager with one son aged 24, lives in Birmingham</p> <p>At 53, John Kelleher is perfectly placed to see just how much change one generation has made to our attitudes to money. 'When I first started work, I was an apprentice at a local light engineering factory. My father believed that if I got an apprenticeship to a proper trade I'd be financially secure for life. He was completely wrong.' John has been paying into a pension since his twenties. But, unlike many younger people, he never expected to retire at 50. 'I've never been a get-rich-quick person. It's been slow and steady for me, and it's only in the past 10 years that I've begun to feel less financially anxious and more secure.' Apart from his pension, John has gradually made money - at least on paper - through his house. 'My wife Maureen and I bought our first house in our twenties for \u00a34,750.</p> <p>In the early days, he had sleepless nights worrying about money. 'Of course I did. Suppose I'd lost my job? Suppose we couldn't quite make all the payments one month?' After a couple of years, things got easier. The mortgage got more manageable and John and Maureen traded up. 'We've always had this strategy of buying the worst possible house in the best possible location, and doing it up.'</p> <p>Slow but steady, they now live in a 'very nice, big house'. Maureen's adding an extension this year, which will set them back \u00a335,000. 'But that's also our future. We'll sell and move somewhere smaller when we retire.' John has always been a saver and a financial planner, a comparative rarity in Britain where one in four adults has no pension provision at all, and where we currently save less than we have since the boom spending years of Nigel Lawson's 80s. According to Professor Paul Webley, an economics psychologist at the University of Exeter, our poor saving record generally is another indication of our increasingly individualistic society. 'Saving behaviour is long-term behaviour. People do it when they think 10 years and more ahead. And the people who do that tend to be family or community orientated, which gives them a long-term perspective - they know what and who they are saving for.'</p> <p>Managing a shopping centre has made John a jaded consumer. 'As you get older, the fog lifts. You start thinking how much surplus stuff everyone has, and how so much of it is basically pricey rubbish.' These days, about 50 per cent of his salary goes on the mortgage and essential bills. The other half is spent on the house, meals out, the musicals he loves and on golf, his big passion that costs about \u00a330 a round. He likes to spoil the family at Christmas and birthdays, 'but I can still get shocked at the price of things for children. My nephew and niece wear shoes that cost \u00a3150 just for school.' He wouldn't spend that on himself ('Kids are the label obsessives'), and buys his suits at a discount retailer.</p> <p>John's 24-year-old son still lives at home. 'He has no choice. All his friends are the same. It's virtually impossible for young people to get on to the housing ladder now. I worry about them. There's so much pressure on them financially, and to work and earn more and more. If I won the Lottery tomorrow, I'd love to start a business of my own. Partly for my sake, but partly so that I could leave something to my son to get him established in life.'</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,382674,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Read part two of 21st century money herrehere</a></p>",

She also buys bits and pieces for the house. 'I'm paying \u00a345 a month for two leather sofas'; '\u00a3210 a month for a year-old Rover 200'; and she buys clothes for the children. 'That's my biggest financial headache. I buy my own clothes from Gap or Laura Ashley, but my daughter only wants designer labels.' Like all children, Janet's are sophisticated and relentless consumers, 'they are so susceptible to advertising and peer pressure, and they put enormous pressure on their parents in turn. It's all Calvin Klein and DKNY, and I really resent it.' But she does give in. 'More than I should. It becomes so important to them.' Andrew Oswald's reflection on all definitions of affluence being relative is completely realised in Janet's situation. 'We live in Berkshire. I can drive a couple of miles in one direction to the school where I work, and see people who are genuinely in need. One child won a merit badge for sports, and we asked the parents to contribute 75p for the cost of the badge. I had a note sent back explaining that they couldn't afford it.' But she can drive a few miles in the opposite direction and she's bang in the middle of the Home Counties commuter belt. 'The houses are worth five, six million. And then I suddenly feel quite poor.' According to Karen Rowlingson, a lecturer in social policy at the University of Bath, this 360-degree vision makes Janet unusually well balanced. 'Most of us tend to mix only with our own peer group, and that's how we decide if we're financially comfortable or not. Some people are very well off by national standards and just don't feel it, because they've got no idea of how the rest of the country lives.' Janet agrees. 'I think we're fine. We're about the right-sized fish for our own pond. In an ideal world, I'd like \u00a320k a year without having to work for it, but that's just dreaming. My neighbour won \u00a3120,000 on the Lottery and I wasn't remotely jealous - just delighted for them. But I've started doing the Lottery now.' When Janet worries about money, it's about the future, not the present. 'I want for both my husband and I to retire young - early fifties - and then have time and money to travel. But I don't know whether we'll be able to; we don't really save, apart from pensions.' Like most people in the South East, she's invested her hopes in the runaway housing market. 'I'm hoping we'll have enough equity in the house to help.' She already has money put aside for the children's education. 'Otherwise I'd be worried sick. We're reaching a point with loans and fees where working-class kids will be barred from higher education again. That is desperately sad.' John Kelleher (\u00a335,000 + bonus ) 53, married, shopping-centre manager with one son aged 24, lives in Birmingham At 53, John Kelleher is perfectly placed to see just how much change one generation has made to our attitudes to money. 'When I first started work, I was an apprentice at a local light engineering factory. My father believed that if I got an apprenticeship to a proper trade I'd be financially secure for life. He was completely wrong.' John has been paying into a pension since his twenties. But, unlike many younger people, he never expected to retire at 50. 'I've never been a get-rich-quick person. It's been slow and steady for me, and it's only in the past 10 years that I've begun to feel less financially anxious and more secure.' Apart from his pension, John has gradually made money - at least on paper - through his house. 'My wife Maureen and I bought our first house in our twenties for \u00a34,750. In the early days, he had sleepless nights worrying about money. 'Of course I did. Suppose I'd lost my job? Suppose we couldn't quite make all the payments one month?' After a couple of years, things got easier. The mortgage got more manageable and John and Maureen traded up. 'We've always had this strategy of buying the worst possible house in the best possible location, and doing it up.' Slow but steady, they now live in a 'very nice, big house'. Maureen's adding an extension this year, which will set them back \u00a335,000. 'But that's also our future. We'll sell and move somewhere smaller when we retire.' John has always been a saver and a financial planner, a comparative rarity in Britain where one in four adults has no pension provision at all, and where we currently save less than we have since the boom spending years of Nigel Lawson's 80s. According to Professor Paul Webley, an economics psychologist at the University of Exeter, our poor saving record generally is another indication of our increasingly individualistic society. 'Saving behaviour is long-term behaviour. People do it when they think 10 years and more ahead. And the people who do that tend to be family or community orientated, which gives them a long-term perspective - they know what and who they are saving for.' Managing a shopping centre has made John a jaded consumer. 'As you get older, the fog lifts. You start thinking how much surplus stuff everyone has, and how so much of it is basically pricey rubbish.' These days, about 50 per cent of his salary goes on the mortgage and essential bills. The other half is spent on the house, meals out, the musicals he loves and on golf, his big passion that costs about \u00a330 a round. He likes to spoil the family at Christmas and birthdays, 'but I can still get shocked at the price of things for children. My nephew and niece wear shoes that cost \u00a3150 just for school.' He wouldn't spend that on himself ('Kids are the label obsessives'), and buys his suits at a discount retailer. John's 24-year-old son still lives at home. 'He has no choice. All his friends are the same. It's virtually impossible for young people to get on to the housing ladder now. I worry about them. There's so much pressure on them financially, and to work and earn more and more. If I won the Lottery tomorrow, I'd love to start a business of my own. Partly for my sake, but partly so that I could leave something to my son to get him established in life.' Read part two of 21st century money herrehere",

      "body": "<p>It was around the time of our daughter's third birthday that things began to get competitive. It started innocently enough, when the parents of a child besotted with Peter Pan decided to hire an actor to arrive at his party dressed as Captain Hook. Two guests peed their pants in fear and a third refused to come out from behind the sofa, but once the actor had sacrificed his wig, his sword and his dignity to win them over, it was a roaring success. So the next birthday party a few weeks later took their pirate and raised it with an actor, a face-painter and a jolly man in dungarees who could make swords from balloons.</p> <p>That was March. By June, if you hadn't booked the Golden Hinde for your child's pirate party you felt that social services might be calling any second to prosecute you for neglect, and my daughter's face had been decorated with a moustache so often she was beginning to sport a permanent five-o'clock shadow (face paint doesn't wash off easily, especially when it's on a tired, overstimulated kid wired on birthday cake). No one wants their child to miss out, and each successive party seemed to have a more novel venue or more elaborate entertainment.</p> <p>My daughter is six now, and she and her four-year-old brother have a social diary that would be the envy of any It Girl. Scrooge picked the wrong celebration to get stressed about: Christmas comes but once a year, but birthdays seem to crop up weekly. Usually on the same day, and in far-flung locations that each need a parent to act as chaperone. We've been to parties in parks and play centres, in museums and theatres, on ships and steam trains. As well as seen what seems like every children's entertainer in the south of England. Several times.</p> <p>There was the alternative entertainer who tried - unsuccessfully - to get 20 sugar-dosed four-year-olds to sit quietly on the floor while she strummed her guitar and sang them politically correct nursery rhymes. There were the two students who'd thought kids parties would be an easy way to supplement their grant: they came with a set of complicated games that went way over the audience's heads, and left an hour later pale and shaken, saying they'd never realised people so small could hit so hard, or make so much noise.</p> <p>There was the pretty puppeteer in the rather tight pyjamas who was such a hit with the dads that she was booked for four parties before the children announced that they were sick of her. And there was the very aware, caring but overworked black Londoner who, realising rather late that entertainers were expected, panic-booked a magician - any magician - for his twin boys' fourth birthday. It was only when the man arrived and began setting up that the ugly pun in his name sank in. Wally Gog played to an audience of delighted children and embarrassed adults while the twins' mum loudly berated their dad in the kitchen. Send in the clowns.</p> <p>It could be worse, of course. It could be America. The New York Times recently reported on the trend for little girls' birthday parties in beauty parlours: the guests have their hair done, their nails painted, get a full makeover and are then given modelling lessons. With tea shops springing up in every store front not already colonised by Starbucks, there's also a fad for junior tea parties: the guests dress up in hats, gloves and beads and enjoy tea and cakes while learning etiquette: how to take gloves off correctly, where to put a napkin, and how to hold your little finger in the air while sipping.

      "bodyText": "It was around the time of our daughter's third birthday that things began to get competitive. It started innocently enough, when the parents of a child besotted with Peter Pan decided to hire an actor to arrive at his party dressed as Captain Hook. Two guests peed their pants in fear and a third refused to come out from behind the sofa, but once the actor had sacrificed his wig, his sword and his dignity to win them over, it was a roaring success. So the next birthday party a few weeks later took their pirate and raised it with an actor, a face-painter and a jolly man in dungarees who could make swords from balloons. That was March. By June, if you hadn't booked the Golden Hinde for your child's pirate party you felt that social services might be calling any second to prosecute you for neglect, and my daughter's face had been decorated with a moustache so often she was beginning to sport a permanent five-o'clock shadow (face paint doesn't wash off easily, especially when it's on a tired, overstimulated kid wired on birthday cake). No one wants their child to miss out, and each successive party seemed to have a more novel venue or more elaborate entertainment. My daughter is six now, and she and her four-year-old brother have a social diary that would be the envy of any It Girl. Scrooge picked the wrong celebration to get stressed about: Christmas comes but once a year, but birthdays seem to crop up weekly. Usually on the same day, and in far-flung locations that each need a parent to act as chaperone. We've been to parties in parks and play centres, in museums and theatres, on ships and steam trains. As well as seen what seems like every children's entertainer in the south of England. Several times. There was the alternative entertainer who tried - unsuccessfully - to get 20 sugar-dosed four-year-olds to sit quietly on the floor while she strummed her guitar and sang them politically correct nursery rhymes. There were the two students who'd thought kids parties would be an easy way to supplement their grant: they came with a set of complicated games that went way over the audience's heads, and left an hour later pale and shaken, saying they'd never realised people so small could hit so hard, or make so much noise. There was the pretty puppeteer in the rather tight pyjamas who was such a hit with the dads that she was booked for four parties before the children announced that they were sick of her. And there was the very aware, caring but overworked black Londoner who, realising rather late that entertainers were expected, panic-booked a magician - any magician - for his twin boys' fourth birthday. It was only when the man arrived and began setting up that the ugly pun in his name sank in. Wally Gog played to an audience of delighted children and embarrassed adults while the twins' mum loudly berated their dad in the kitchen. Send in the clowns. It could be worse, of course. It could be America. The New York Times recently reported on the trend for little girls' birthday parties in beauty parlours: the guests have their hair done, their nails painted, get a full makeover and are then given modelling lessons. With tea shops springing up in every store front not already colonised by Starbucks, there's also a fad for junior tea parties: the guests dress up in hats, gloves and beads and enjoy tea and cakes while learning etiquette: how to take gloves off correctly, where to put a napkin, and how to hold your little finger in the air while sipping. 'You'd be amazed how many don't know,' said the owner of one shop, Special Teas. Me, I'm happy if my youngest remembers where his mouth is: he often gets so excited that his juice ends up all over the table, his lap and half the other guests. In New York, wealthy parents seem to compensate for never seeing their children with evermore lavish celebrations. Professional party organiser Chuck Santoro told the Times about a birthday he arranged in a Park Avenue penthouse. The furniture was cleared and a funfair moved in, with a mini-motorcycle ride, since the guest of honour loved them. He was three. Santoro arranges $4,000 brunches for kids at the swanky Four Seasons Hotel, but his most regular gig is at the giant Fifth Avenue toy store FAO Schwarz, which holds Saturday-night sleepover parties. The 15 young guests get to raid the sweet shop, play games, dress up in the shop's clothes and sleep there till breakfast time, after which they're given $100 vouchers to spend in the shop before it reopens to the public.

The royal family continue to sink, with both the Queen and Prince Charles ranking below the new royals - David and Victoria Beckham. No fewer than 16 Americans figured in the top 100 names, reflecting the growing importance of US power. But there were only eight women - and of those, two, the Queen and Cherie Booth, can hardly be regarded as normal candidates. The powerful are male, middle-aged and white. </p> <p>Despite the rise of the corporate and private sectors, the two most powerful white, middle-aged males in Britain are politicians, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. Brown has won the No 2 spot that two years ago was held by Rupert Murdoch and last year by Bill Gates. It has become ever clearer that the Chancellor is the animating intellectual, economic and political force behind New Labour, and the judges seriously discussed whether he even deserved to be No 1. It is Brown, after all, who has designed every significant New Labour economic and social policy, and it is his judgment that will settle the key political decisions on the euro and the timing of the next general election. On the other hand, it is the Prime Minister who has last say over patronage and appointment, over which Blair retains a tight control; it is Blair who decides on policy towards, say, the House of Lords; he also led the war in Kosovo. On those grounds he deserves (just) to be No 1. </p> <p>But if Blair and Brown are powerful, it is a power more constrained and limited than ever before. There is the awesome and rising power of the right-wing tabloid press, reflected in the upward move in the rankings for the third successive year of David Yelland, editor of the Sun (34) and the ever-high position of Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of the Daily Mail (23), that together aggressively articulate the still dominant conservative ascendancy. The leader of the petrol protest, Brynle Williams, enters the list (254), along with the Countryside Alliance's chief executive, Richard Burge (197), as exponents of conservative direct activism - while William Hague has jumped to 50, a tribute to the Tory leader's capacity to exploit (until this month's debacle over on-the-spot fines for cannabis possession) populism to serve his cause. </p> <p>Those forces represent but one constraint on New Labour's power. There is the sheer weight of corporate power, with Sir John Browne of BP and Chris Gent of Vodafone (10 and 12 respectively). Independent central bankers Alan Greenspan (president of the US Federal Reserve) and Sir Eddie George (3 and 6) pay tribute to the power of the financial markets and their crucial role in determining interest rates. Steve Case, the architect of the AOL-Time Warner merger creating the world's largest corporation, Bill Gates and John Chambers, the president of Cisco Systems, (4, 8 and 11) represent not only the extraordinary transformatory dynamism of the new economy but their pivotal role as developers and gatekeepers of the new networks. Indeed, IT companies and the brains behind the hi-tech revolution are even better represented than last year. Two politicians may top the list, but the world they rule is a conservative business civilisation moving from being organised around factories and offices to one organised around networks - and which has a momentum and force independent of government. </p> <p>Indeed the powerful grip of not just the internet but the entire information revolution extends across the entire 300 names. The explosion of mobile-phone use is not only represented by Vodafone, but by Hans Snook of Orange (58). Shawn Fanning, the 19-year-old who invented Napster, which allows downloading of music from the net, enters the list at 189, and Professor Manuel Castells, dubbed the 'first great philosopher of cyberspace', is ranked at 139. Novelist William Gibson, the man whocoined the term cyberspace, joins the ranking at 288 - and the massive growth of computer games is reflected in the No 15 position of Nobuyuki Idei as head of Sony, which has sold 4 million PlayStations in Britain. Satosha Tajiri, who invented Pok\u00e9mon, is a new entry at 123. Many of the scientists in the list are closely connected to IT - or like the architects of genomics, John Sulston (116) and Craig Ventor (117), have made their advances in disciplines that are closely related. </p> <p>But in a world in which the capacity to digitalise, network and download is becoming ever more important and transformatory - so accelerating a bewildering new volatility and pace of change - people still need durable landmarks around which to organise themselves. They look less to religion - the only representative of organised religion, Pope John Paul II, ranks at 262, falling for the third successive year - but to the certainties provided by solid branding, a surrogate for community membership. The phenomenon is multi-faced. It lies behind the entry into the list at 203 of advertising guru Trevor Beattie, the man who gave us the Wonderbra ads and fcuk. McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Pret A Manger and Nike are all brand names that have made it to the list before, but Howard Schultz, the originator of Starbucks and cappuccino capitalism, is a new entry at 100. As is Frenchman Bernard Arnault (104), the architect of Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, a company that lives by its luxury brands ranging from Dior to Louis Vuitton. Stelios Haji-Ioannou (79) is the entrepreneur behind easyJet, and even Tiger Woods's entry into the list at 224 is in part because he has rebranded golf. </p> <p>The media, the vehicle by which brands and imagery are promoted, is as heavily represented as ever - although this year, reflecting the power of clubbing and dance music, Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong has made the list at 146. </p> <p>Indeed, if the list is any indicator, the British are growing more fun-loving and interested in culture and sport.

      "body": "<p>Russian market researcher Sergei Yashko sees hope in the Fairy washing-up liquid and Comet washing powder he found in a \u00a312-a-month household in a tiny village outside Samara, on the Volga river. 'This confirms that even in extremely poor rural areas, people have tried out western brands - and there is future potential,' he said. </p> <p>The growth of Russia's gigantic consumer market is one of the key drivers of economic recovery, Yashko insists. And most pundits agree. Domestic producers of value-for-money goods are doing a roaring trade and, aided by the fourfold rouble devaluation in 1998, are threatening to drive foreign companies from the market. </p> <p>Poverty remains a formidable obstacle to the market's growth. Average wages were 1,520 roubles (\u00a338) a month in 1999, according to state statistics. People below the official poverty line of 900 roubles a month include teachers, engineers, state-sector scientists and nurses. </p> <p>A survey by GfK, the Moscow marketing company for which Yashko works, showed that poor Russians typically supplement their monthly earnings of between \u00a38 and \u00a39 per person with between \u00a32 and \u00a33 from the 'grey' (unofficial) economy, and often grow some of their food on their country allotments (dachas). </p> <p>Their staple diet includes potatoes, bread, cheap vegetables, macaroni and porridge. They strictly limit consumption of meat, fish, fruits, cheese and sweets. Fairy Liquid, or a rival Russian brand, is measured out a drop at a time. </p> <p>The survey found that furniture and electrical appliances are mostly of Seventies vintage; holidays are usually with relatives or at the family dacha; and outings to the theatre or cinema rare. </p> <p>Where, then, is the scope for branded products? Yashko said: 'The possibilities in the consumer market are part of overall economic recovery. GDP has been increasing, and we expect it to rise by between 5 and 6 per cent in 2000. </p> <p>'Real incomes are increasing; the government has just put up the pensions and the pay of many state employees. There has been a substantial decline of unemployment.' Then there is the grey economy, which adds between a third and two-thirds. </p> <p>What cash consumers have is most likely to be spent on value-for-money goods churned out by the rising domestic producers - many of them learnt, but not necessarily copied, from western importers who made the running until the 1998 crash. </p> <p>So when that rural Samara household finally uses its last drop of Fairy Liquid, it may replace it with a domestically produced one. GfK says that before the 1998 meltdown, Fairy manufacturer Procter &amp; Gamble had 36 per cent (by volume) of the Russian detergents market; that fell to 14 per cent last April. </p> <p>In the same period the share of the detergents market held by all foreign manufacturers together fell from 71 per cent to 43 per cent by volume. </p> <p>They have also taken a pounding in the markets for shampoo (68 per cent down to 38 per cent by volume) and toothpaste (77 per cent to 49 per cent).

      "bodyText": "Russian market researcher Sergei Yashko sees hope in the Fairy washing-up liquid and Comet washing powder he found in a \u00a312-a-month household in a tiny village outside Samara, on the Volga river. 'This confirms that even in extremely poor rural areas, people have tried out western brands - and there is future potential,' he said. The growth of Russia's gigantic consumer market is one of the key drivers of economic recovery, Yashko insists. And most pundits agree. Domestic producers of value-for-money goods are doing a roaring trade and, aided by the fourfold rouble devaluation in 1998, are threatening to drive foreign companies from the market. Poverty remains a formidable obstacle to the market's growth. Average wages were 1,520 roubles (\u00a338) a month in 1999, according to state statistics. People below the official poverty line of 900 roubles a month include teachers, engineers, state-sector scientists and nurses. A survey by GfK, the Moscow marketing company for which Yashko works, showed that poor Russians typically supplement their monthly earnings of between \u00a38 and \u00a39 per person with between \u00a32 and \u00a33 from the 'grey' (unofficial) economy, and often grow some of their food on their country allotments (dachas). Their staple diet includes potatoes, bread, cheap vegetables, macaroni and porridge. They strictly limit consumption of meat, fish, fruits, cheese and sweets. Fairy Liquid, or a rival Russian brand, is measured out a drop at a time. The survey found that furniture and electrical appliances are mostly of Seventies vintage; holidays are usually with relatives or at the family dacha; and outings to the theatre or cinema rare. Where, then, is the scope for branded products? Yashko said: 'The possibilities in the consumer market are part of overall economic recovery. GDP has been increasing, and we expect it to rise by between 5 and 6 per cent in 2000. 'Real incomes are increasing; the government has just put up the pensions and the pay of many state employees. There has been a substantial decline of unemployment.' Then there is the grey economy, which adds between a third and two-thirds. What cash consumers have is most likely to be spent on value-for-money goods churned out by the rising domestic producers - many of them learnt, but not necessarily copied, from western importers who made the running until the 1998 crash. So when that rural Samara household finally uses its last drop of Fairy Liquid, it may replace it with a domestically produced one. GfK says that before the 1998 meltdown, Fairy manufacturer Procter &amp; Gamble had 36 per cent (by volume) of the Russian detergents market; that fell to 14 per cent last April. In the same period the share of the detergents market held by all foreign manufacturers together fell from 71 per cent to 43 per cent by volume. They have also taken a pounding in the markets for shampoo (68 per cent down to 38 per cent by volume) and toothpaste (77 per cent to 49 per cent). The international producers' encroachment into the yellow fats market has been reversed, from 41 per cent back down to 23 per cent by volume. Domestic producers, such as Nevskaya Kosmetika of St Petersburg, have moved into the deodorants market, hitherto a foreigners' preserve.

After all, autumnal routs of the Nasdaq, the US stock market for hi-tech shares, are nothing new.

Seven per cent was wiped off Nasdaq's value in a week. </p> <p>But that slump was quickly turned around. Towards the end of last October, strong earnings from Microsoft helped send the Nasdaq on a gravity-defying surge.

But it was not enough to disguise the fact that over the past six weeks the Nasdaq has shed some 1,200 points, about 30 per cent of its value. Now it stands barely above its position 12 months ago.

      "body": "<p>It was one of the most high-profile competition inquiries ever - and, at an estimated cost of \u00a320 million, one of the most expensive. The main tenet was unashamedly populist: the big supermarket groups are conspiring to rip off customers and bankrupt suppliers to keep their profit margins high. </p> <p>All the more embarrassing then that the industry has been so comprehensively let off the hook. As The Observer revealed last month, while the Commission found evidence of unfair competition and restrictive practices, which acted against the public interest, it is not recommending any major changes to address this. </p> <p>The supermarkets have es-caped unscathed. Their relief could, however, be short-lived. For the last two years the big food retailers have been paralysed by uncertainty. No one was brave enough to launch bids, engineer mergers or agree the alliances that have long been talked about, because of the risk that the Competition Commissioners would rule them out. </p> <p>Now that the final report has been made public, all that will change. The industry will be able to switch its attention from shouting about how competitive it is, to engineering deals to reduce the intensity of that competition. In-deed, some believe the report effectively gives the green light to any combination of the major companies, regardless of how large their share of shoppers' purses. The commissioners conclude that the supermarket industry is local: how many of us would drive more than 20 minutes to get to a supermarket, never mind travel to a different part of the country? </p> <p>Some analysts believe that means Tesco could, in theory, bid for Sainsbury, even though it would have more than 30 per cent of the national market, provided Tesco could demonstrate that it does not have a monopoly in any local area or was willing to sell stores where that could be a problem. </p> <p>In practice, however, Tesco would find it hard to do a deal with any of its British rivals. It is, by some way, the largest of the four big chains, with a share of over 17 per cent. Even Safeway, the smallest of the big four, has more than 10 per cent of the market so a bid would take it over the 25 per cent trigger for a competition referral. More worrying, however, is Tesco's dominance in the South of England. The Commissioners report that there are five areas, including Cambridge and Salisbury, where it has more than half the market, and some estimate that there are at least 70 areas where it has a 40 per cent share.

      "bodyText": "It was one of the most high-profile competition inquiries ever - and, at an estimated cost of \u00a320 million, one of the most expensive. The main tenet was unashamedly populist: the big supermarket groups are conspiring to rip off customers and bankrupt suppliers to keep their profit margins high. All the more embarrassing then that the industry has been so comprehensively let off the hook. As The Observer revealed last month, while the Commission found evidence of unfair competition and restrictive practices, which acted against the public interest, it is not recommending any major changes to address this. The supermarkets have es-caped unscathed. Their relief could, however, be short-lived. For the last two years the big food retailers have been paralysed by uncertainty. No one was brave enough to launch bids, engineer mergers or agree the alliances that have long been talked about, because of the risk that the Competition Commissioners would rule them out. Now that the final report has been made public, all that will change. The industry will be able to switch its attention from shouting about how competitive it is, to engineering deals to reduce the intensity of that competition. In-deed, some believe the report effectively gives the green light to any combination of the major companies, regardless of how large their share of shoppers' purses. The commissioners conclude that the supermarket industry is local: how many of us would drive more than 20 minutes to get to a supermarket, never mind travel to a different part of the country? Some analysts believe that means Tesco could, in theory, bid for Sainsbury, even though it would have more than 30 per cent of the national market, provided Tesco could demonstrate that it does not have a monopoly in any local area or was willing to sell stores where that could be a problem. In practice, however, Tesco would find it hard to do a deal with any of its British rivals. It is, by some way, the largest of the four big chains, with a share of over 17 per cent. Even Safeway, the smallest of the big four, has more than 10 per cent of the market so a bid would take it over the 25 per cent trigger for a competition referral. More worrying, however, is Tesco's dominance in the South of England. The Commissioners report that there are five areas, including Cambridge and Salisbury, where it has more than half the market, and some estimate that there are at least 70 areas where it has a 40 per cent share. Add in virtually any of the other majors and Tesco would end up having to sell so many sites that it would make the deal pointless.

The FTSE 100 Index has been going roughly nowhere for the last three years, the longest sideways spell since the crash in October 1987. Chartist William Adlard is drawing lines and diamonds all over graphs of the main stock market indices, and warning of further stock market weakness. </p> <p>But no one, not even Adlard or Tony Jackson, the equity strategist at Charterhouse Securities who highlighted the FTSE trends, is predicting that this October will bring another crash. </p> <p>That may be partly because, as one strategist put it, the bears have been wrong for so long that they no longer have any credibility. 'If I say to my clients that prices could actually fall sharply, they do not want to know,' he said. 'They say \"unless you can tell me what is going to cause it, or when it is going to happen, we are not interested\".' </p> <p>But it may be because, for many investors, the crash has already happened. The stock market is more or less where it was two years ago, but that surface calm disguises huge swings in individual shares and sectors. </p> <p>For a start, take the behaviour of technology stocks over the last two months. Both Nasdaq and its British equivalent, the Techmark 100, have lost around a fifth of their value since the start of September. Taken from their peaks in March, the slide has been an even more dramatic 40 per cent. That may not quite rival 1973-74, when the All-Share dropped by two thirds in a year, or 1929, when US prices fell by 87 per cent over three years, but it is roughly the same as the fall in British shares between October and December 1987. That may, with hindsight, look like just a brief correction but it felt like a crash at the time. </p> <p>The key difference is the speed of the fall. This time round, the decline has been gradual. While there have been bad days, the falls have generally been of 100 points or so - bad, but not that significant in percentage terms. In 1929, by contrast, US shares fell by 13.5 per cent on 28 October and a further 11.7 per cent the following day. In 1987, the All-Share dropped 9.7 per cent on Black Monday - 19 October - and a further 11 per cent the following day. If markets were to fall by a similar percentage now, it would mean a fall of more than 1,200 points in the FTSE 100 index. </p> <p>But 1987 has taught us that what Alan Greenspan of the US Federal Reserve calls 'irrational exuberance' must be paid for. The crash then came after a period of sharply rising prices - the Dow, for example, gained 44 per cent between January and October. The falls that followed simply corrected much of that excess. </p> <p>So, too, with recent falls. Most investors agree that the dramatic rise in technology shares between November last year and March 2000 was excessive. The Techmark 100 may have been in the doldrums since March, but it is still more than 40 per cent above its level when it launched in October 1999. Some of the riskier technology stocks - like 365 Corporation or QXL - are standing below the prices at which they were floated. However, the shares of many companies that are already profiting from the new economy - including software suppliers such as CMG or service companies such as Capita - have risen sharply in the last two years. </p> <p>But what about those unfortunate companies that the market has decided are not part of the bright new technological future? They did not share in the big spring bounce but are still out of favour even though investors are being more realistic about the technology miracle. Their performance has been painful for those unlucky enough to be stuck with them. Companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Imperial Chemical Industries and Whitbread are 60 per cent or more below the highs of the past two years. </p> <p>Swathes of the stock market - food manufacturers, retailers, cigarette makers and water and electricity companies - have been in decline for much of the last two years. Value investors, who have traditionally made a living from buying such cheap stocks and waiting for them to recover, have joined the bears in hibernation. Growth, it seems, is all investors are looking for these days. </p> <p>However, the falls in old economy stocks are becoming less indiscriminate. Companies such as Next and Tesco, which are prospering despite the depressed high street, or Royal Bank of Scotland, which is expected to grow strongly following its acquisition of NatWest, have all seen their shares marked up sharply in the last few months. It is those that have not yet shown that they can prosper in a low-inflation, highly competitive environment that are being shunned. </p> <p>The trouble is that, even after the falls of the last six months, the growth stocks that investors want are still not coming cheap. The telecoms sector is priced at 78 times last year's earnings, software groups such as Sage and Logica are on similar multiples. That can only be justified if the growth at least meets, and ideally beats, market expectations. But there are increasing signs that the technology miracle may not be quite what it was cracked up to be. </p> <p>Company after company - Lucent, Apple, Yahoo, Motorola, Dell - have disappointed the market. Revenge has been swift. Yahoo, for example, plunged 17.5 per cent, despite reporting record profits in line with expectations, because it admitted that advertising from dotcom companies was slowing. </p> <p>So far, however, the bad news has largely been confined to the other side of the Atlantic. Over here, the news has generally been positive. That is encouraging for Michael O'Sullivan, equity strategist at Commerzbank. </p> <p>'People have been selling technology stocks in the indiscriminate way they were buying last autumn. The euro tech baby is being thrown out with the US bath water. But our message is \"don't panic\". Europe is holding up. ARM's results were good, Alcatel has made a positive statement and Misys, too.' </p> <p>He pointed out that the US technology industry relies heavily on personal computers while in Europe there is a bias towards mobile and digital technology. That, he believes, should shield us from the US market's troubles. </p> <p>Others are less convinced. One strategist pointed to the telecoms sector, where debts have raced ahead even faster than share prices, as particularly vulnerable. Its inflated valuations are predicated on mobiles taking over from PCs as the preferred method of accessing the internet. But the technology is so new that it is impossible to judge whether that will be true. </p> <p>Banking regulators and corporate bond holders are starting to get nervous about the amount of money being gambled on the theory. The drop in the price of companies such as Vodafone suggests that investors are not quite as certain about it as they were. That does not mean they are baling out completely but they are keeping an eye on the calender and will breathe a sigh of relief when October ends.</p>",

Value investors, who have traditionally made a living from buying such cheap stocks and waiting for them to recover, have joined the bears in hibernation. Growth, it seems, is all investors are looking for these days. However, the falls in old economy stocks are becoming less indiscriminate. Companies such as Next and Tesco, which are prospering despite the depressed high street, or Royal Bank of Scotland, which is expected to grow strongly following its acquisition of NatWest, have all seen their shares marked up sharply in the last few months. It is those that have not yet shown that they can prosper in a low-inflation, highly competitive environment that are being shunned. The trouble is that, even after the falls of the last six months, the growth stocks that investors want are still not coming cheap. The telecoms sector is priced at 78 times last year's earnings, software groups such as Sage and Logica are on similar multiples. That can only be justified if the growth at least meets, and ideally beats, market expectations. But there are increasing signs that the technology miracle may not be quite what it was cracked up to be. Company after company - Lucent, Apple, Yahoo, Motorola, Dell - have disappointed the market. Revenge has been swift. Yahoo, for example, plunged 17.5 per cent, despite reporting record profits in line with expectations, because it admitted that advertising from dotcom companies was slowing. So far, however, the bad news has largely been confined to the other side of the Atlantic. Over here, the news has generally been positive. That is encouraging for Michael O'Sullivan, equity strategist at Commerzbank. 'People have been selling technology stocks in the indiscriminate way they were buying last autumn. The euro tech baby is being thrown out with the US bath water. But our message is \"don't panic\". Europe is holding up. ARM's results were good, Alcatel has made a positive statement and Misys, too.' He pointed out that the US technology industry relies heavily on personal computers while in Europe there is a bias towards mobile and digital technology. That, he believes, should shield us from the US market's troubles. Others are less convinced. One strategist pointed to the telecoms sector, where debts have raced ahead even faster than share prices, as particularly vulnerable. Its inflated valuations are predicated on mobiles taking over from PCs as the preferred method of accessing the internet. But the technology is so new that it is impossible to judge whether that will be true. Banking regulators and corporate bond holders are starting to get nervous about the amount of money being gambled on the theory. The drop in the price of companies such as Vodafone suggests that investors are not quite as certain about it as they were. That does not mean they are baling out completely but they are keeping an eye on the calender and will breathe a sigh of relief when October ends.",

A man who knows how to make things run on budget and on time. </p> <p>But the oddest thing about 'Red Ken' appointing Kiley is that he was a senior CIA officer between 1963 and 1970. The CIA during the Sixties spent time destabilising Latin America, thwarting communism in the Third World and spying on students. Kiley had been a leader of the US equivalent of the National Union of Students - a notorious CIA front - for two years until 1960. He went on to be active in student politics in Europe. </p> <p>Kiley prefers not to dwell on his CIA days. Peter Goldmark, now publisher of the International Herald Tribune and former leader of the New York Port Authority when Kiley was heading up New York's Metropolitan Transport Authority, says Kiley's CIA experience taught him how to navigate complicated bureaucracies. 'But he's no spook,' he said. </p> <p>Those close to Kiley describe him as honest and a superb transport 'architect': not prone to grand gestures or fanfare but adept at 'springing an offside trap' on his opponents.

'The Government will be having the screaming abdabs about this,' he said. </p> <p>The reasons for that are clear. The 1997 landslide-winning election manifesto carried a commitment to revitalise the Tube. The capital turned red partly thanks to this commitment. Next year Labour will ask the electorate for another term, but since they won office, the Underground system has deteriorated to the point where major delays and chronic overcrowding are taken for granted. It's among the most expensive systems in the world, yet on one line - the Central - more trains ran per hour in the Fifties than they do now. So much for progress. </p> <p>The Government's solution is the public-private partnership - Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott's baby. The PPP is a financing method through which private sector consortia carve up the network into three bundles and effectively own and run it for 30 years. </p> <p>Under PPP the system is in danger of 'dying by a thousand cuts', said a top Livingstone adviser last week. The PPP is the subject of an unprecedented review by the National Audit office, under fire from the Health and Safety Executive for possibly compromising safety and severely criticised by the Industrial Society in an independent report. The principal underground unions, the RMT and Aslef, are implacably opposed to PPP. Industrial action as the election looms is a strong possibility. </p> <p>The arrival of Kiley, who will make his first appearance in the capital next weekend, has made potential PPP bidders edgy. 'We welcome his appointment. It's tremendous news. His job is to ensure we run on time. Our reservation is that he'll involve himself in the PPP argument. That's not his job,' said one consortium leader. </p> <p>Speaking from New York, Kiley insists he will wade in if he feels the PPP financing system is not in the interests of passengers. The Government ' is clearly committed to this process. I hope it's not a blind commitment', he said. 'There's bound to be some tension, some bumping in the night. That's just human nature. It's politics at work. </p> <p>'One very big question in my mind about both the bus operations which have been privatised and the Underground is whether the public will get what it needs through contract management and enforcement, because you could argue that it has a very limited amount of leverage - and that becomes a great playing field for the lawyers and the accountants but not for the people who are really charged with operating and delivering a quality service.' </p> <p>Kiley will adopt a forensic line in ensuring the PPP suits London. 'How well drafted are these contracts? How transparent are they? How realistic are the goals? What are the actual financing arrangements? Who will end up paying if the economics turn out to be underestimated?' </p> <p>A major part of Kiley's appeal to Livingstone, who's paying him \u00a3500,000 per annum for four years if he delivers, was that he was responsible for issuing billions of dollars worth of bonds for New York's Metropolitan Transport Authority which allowed him to refurbish the whole system. This is how Livingstone wants the Tube to be financed. </p> <p>The scene is set for a fascinating dual between central and devolved local government if, as expected, Kiley finds enough holes in the PPP system to cause him to oppose it. 'Critical to this working over time will be the ability of local officials, local governments to raise revenue on their own. National Government will always be the parent, but the more freedom there can be to experiment and try different things at local level the better off everyone is going to be.' </p> <p>Kiley said that as Commissioner of Transport for London he will work in totally new premises. There'll be no sharing space with London Underground or bus managers - devastatingly described by Livingstone as 'dullards'. He is clearly enthused with being part of a new dawn in local democracy and says how the Government reacts to him will be a test of its mettle. </p> <p>Kiley's priority will be to reorganise the privatised bus services' contracts, which according to Livingstone serve as little more than a 'cartel' for the six companies that run the capital's routes. More bus lanes and conductors will be a priority. </p> <p>As for the Tube, the New Yorker who likes to 'leap out of bed and hit the floor running' - despite suffering from a pinched nerve in his back - will have to increase capacity on existing lines by overhauling the maintenance and breakdown services as well as replacing antique signalling, points and tracks. </p> <p>Kiley's new job is a mighty challenge for someone old enough to be eligible for free travel on London's public transport system. </p> <p>If he succeeds you feel almost anything is possible.

'One very big question in my mind about both the bus operations which have been privatised and the Underground is whether the public will get what it needs through contract management and enforcement, because you could argue that it has a very limited amount of leverage - and that becomes a great playing field for the lawyers and the accountants but not for the people who are really charged with operating and delivering a quality service.' Kiley will adopt a forensic line in ensuring the PPP suits London. 'How well drafted are these contracts? How transparent are they? How realistic are the goals? What are the actual financing arrangements? Who will end up paying if the economics turn out to be underestimated?' A major part of Kiley's appeal to Livingstone, who's paying him \u00a3500,000 per annum for four years if he delivers, was that he was responsible for issuing billions of dollars worth of bonds for New York's Metropolitan Transport Authority which allowed him to refurbish the whole system. This is how Livingstone wants the Tube to be financed. The scene is set for a fascinating dual between central and devolved local government if, as expected, Kiley finds enough holes in the PPP system to cause him to oppose it. 'Critical to this working over time will be the ability of local officials, local governments to raise revenue on their own. National Government will always be the parent, but the more freedom there can be to experiment and try different things at local level the better off everyone is going to be.' Kiley said that as Commissioner of Transport for London he will work in totally new premises. There'll be no sharing space with London Underground or bus managers - devastatingly described by Livingstone as 'dullards'. He is clearly enthused with being part of a new dawn in local democracy and says how the Government reacts to him will be a test of its mettle. Kiley's priority will be to reorganise the privatised bus services' contracts, which according to Livingstone serve as little more than a 'cartel' for the six companies that run the capital's routes. More bus lanes and conductors will be a priority. As for the Tube, the New Yorker who likes to 'leap out of bed and hit the floor running' - despite suffering from a pinched nerve in his back - will have to increase capacity on existing lines by overhauling the maintenance and breakdown services as well as replacing antique signalling, points and tracks. Kiley's new job is a mighty challenge for someone old enough to be eligible for free travel on London's public transport system. If he succeeds you feel almost anything is possible. Perhaps a grateful Prime Minister will point him at the NHS.

      "body": "<p>If you were looking for the best way to make Britain's railways safer you would not start from here. Desperate efforts to improve safety and restore credibility in train travel a year after the Paddington disaster have uncovered a system racked with confusion and neglect. </p> <p>All the technological solutions currently on offer to stop trains shooting red signals are flawed, and the 1 billion passengers that use the network every year have been left without the fullest possible protection as wrangling continues. </p> <p>Tomorrow, Railtrack, which owns the lines, signalling and stations, will respond to a legal challenge by the train drivers' union Aslef calling on the company to scrap its plans to install an inferior safety system. Railtrack will tell the official inquiry investigating safety in the wake of Paddington, and the Southall crash of 1997, that it is pressing ahead with the project to install a non-computerised device called TPWS, with government backing. </p> <p>Britain already lags far behind its principal European neighbours with their state-of-the-art, high-speed, double-deck or tilting trains, newly-built lines, and automatic signalling and accident prevention systems. </p> <p>Successive UK governments and the rail industry have dragged their heels for so long that the computerised Automatic Train Protection (ATP) equipment they were expected to fit a decade ago is now out of date. </p> <p>Safety campaigners and the unions are at loggerheads with Railtrack, the train operators, the safety authorities and the Government. </p> <p>A new generation of technology called the European Train Control System (ETCS) is being furiously developed on the Continent and Britain is involved, but it is not yet ready to be installed. Railtrack and the engineering firm Alstom have been working on ETCS with Siemens of Germany, France's Alcatel, Italy's Ansaldo and various European Union national railway companies. The new system will be compatible across Europe but adapted to fit each national network. Many continental operators are busy signing up for it. </p> <p>Railtrack is poised to sign a \u00a31 billion contract with Alstom later this year for new signalling on the West Coast mainline that will provide new-generation train safety between London, the Midlands and Glasgow by 2005. </p> <p>But beyond the West Coast line there are currently no definite plans or a timetable to order this technology for the rest of the UK network or even just its mainlines. </p> <p>Robin Gisby, Railtrack's network development director, said: 'After West Coast, the East Coast [line] would be next. We are maybe looking at 2006/7, then Great Western, if they are [due for] the next big upgrades. </p> <p>'It is very difficult to build this new system into the existing patchwork of signalling.' </p> <p>Gisby said the company would 'think carefully' about possibly 'retro-fitting' the new system on the existing London-Brighton route or the Midland mainline, which runs via the East Midlands to Yorkshire, 'if we were not going to be upgrading them in the next couple of years'. </p> <p>Words like that prompt industry observers to warn it will be at least a decade before Britain has a decent high speed rail network with automatic safety systems. </p> <p>The Hidden Inquiry into the 1988 Clapham crash, which killed 35 people, recommended that ATP be fitted within five years to eliminate the high number of signals passed at danger (spads). The then Transport Secretary, Cecil Parkinson - a railwayman's son - promised the House of Commons in November 1989: 'Finance will not stand in the way of the implementation of the report.' He was backed by his Labour Shadow, John Prescott. </p> <p>But Parkinson, who called for speedy action, had moved to another job by the time his Conservative government colleagues and British Rail shelved the plans in 1994 - on financial grounds. </p> <p>They calculated that, with a \u00a3550 million price tag, ATP would cost up to \u00a314m for each potential life it saved. Investment on the railways is usually limited to \u00a32m per saved life. Safety spending on the roads, where more than 3,400 people are killed annually, is around \u00a3750,000 per life. </p> <p>While other EU states were modernising their railways in the Nineties, building new high-speed lines and fitting them with ATP, Britain limited its work to the Heathrow Express and the Channel Tunnel, and pushed through privatisation while the bulk of the network crumbled. </p> <p>Only limited ATP pilot schemes were ever introduced. Great Western notoriously had the system installed but not working, because of reliability problems, when its Swansea to London train went through a red light and smashed into a freight train at Southall, killing seven people. </p> <p>Carol Bell, who was injured and traumatised in that crash and is now a safety campaigner, is convinced that existing versions of ATP in use in Britain, other parts of Europe and the US should have been fitted throughout this country a long time ago - and still could be. She is supported by Mick Rix, general secretary of Aslef, which has launched the legal challenge to TPWS currently being aired at the inquiry. </p> <p>Bell is dismayed at the failure to fit ATP, compounded by the distinct lack of commitment to signing up for the new European system for the whole network. </p> <p>Campaigners dread that once TPWS is fitted, the industry will try to wriggle out of upgrading to the European system - even if the Cullen Inquiry into Paddington recommends it, European law encourages it and the Government provides cash towards the \u00a32bn cost. </p> <p>'The sad thing is that \"only\" seven people died at Southall and although 31 deaths at Paddington was dreadful, if it had been the 200 feared at one point then I think there would have been drastic action on safety systems by now,' said Bell. </p> <p>Louise Christian, the solicitor leading the legal battle for the victims of both crashes, said TPWS should be scrapped in order to ensure the most expedient installation of the new European systems. </p> <p>But Sir David Davies, whose report on safety written earlier this year for the Government and accepted by Prescott as Deputy Prime Minister, said: 'The European system for the whole country would take at least nine years to fit, and most people say 15. TPWS can save lives sooner.' </p> <p>Safety campaigners warn there will have to be another crash before the warring parties agree about the best solution, let alone implement it. </p> <p><strong>How the train protection systems compare</strong></p> <p><strong> Automatic Train Protection (ATP)</strong> </p> <p><strong> How it works</strong><br>Generic term for computer-based automatic system. </p> <p>UK version consists of electronic messages from signalling system sent via cables in track or lineside unit to computer on train. Computer tells driver maximum safe speed based on route, speed limits, red signal ahead, etc. If permitted speed is exceeded, brakes are applied automatically. </p> <p><strong> Up and running?</strong> <br>Some form of ATP operating in most EU states. UK has ATP on part of Great Western and Chiltern lines, Heathrow Express and Eurostar trains in Channel Tunnel. </p> <p><strong> Pros</strong><br>98 per cent prevention of accidents caused by signals passed at red. </p> <p><strong> Cons</strong><br>Existing ATP in UK cannot be upgraded to match forthcoming European systems. Difficult and expensive to<strong> </strong> fit to old trains, less reliable. Could take five-15 years. </p> <p><strong> Cost</strong><br>Estimated between \u00a3550 million and \u00a32 billion to fit whole network. </p> <p><strong> European Train Control System (ECTS)</strong> </p> <p><strong> How it works</strong><br>Three levels of fully automatic system linking signalling system to onboard computer. Level One overlays existing signals and transmits data to train giving full ATP up to 180mph. Level Two has improved radio communications capability. </p> <p>Level Three does away with lineside signal and data kit. Train controlled via secure, digital radio links. Line capacity increased as trains can run closer together. </p> <p><strong> Up and running?</strong> <br>Level two currently being fitted to Vienna-Budapest line. Planned for UK West Coast Line by 2005. Further testing planned in Switzerland, France, Italy, Germany and Spain. </p> <p><strong> Pros</strong><br>State of the art train protection and communications. Complies with new EU laws. </p> <p><strong> Cons</strong><br>Difficult to retro-fit, therefore usually installed only when lines upgraded. </p> <p><strong> Cost</strong><br>Estimated \u00a31.1billion-\u00a32bn. </p> <p><strong> Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS)</strong> </p> <p><strong> How it works</strong><br>Cable loops in track transmit radio signals to unit in driver's cab. Brakes are automatically applied if train shoots red signal or goes too fast through speed trap set in advance of signal. Enhances existing UK Automatic Warning System (AWS) that rings bell in cab for green signal, sounds horn for yellow or red, applying brakes if driver does not respond. </p> <p><strong> Up and running?</strong><br>Small-scale trials on part of Thameslink line since 1997. Plans to fit TPWS to all signals at junctions by the end of 2002, and to virtually all rolling stock by the end of 2003. Proposals to trial enhanced system for speeds up to 100mph. </p> <p><strong> Pros</strong><br>Quicker, easier and cheaper to fit than ATP. Reasonably reliable. </p> <p><strong> Cons</strong><br>Current system only effective up to 75mph. TPWS cannot be upgraded to meet new European standards. </p> <p><strong> Cost</strong><br>\u00a3330m</p>",

Robin Gisby, Railtrack's network development director, said: 'After West Coast, the East Coast [line] would be next. We are maybe looking at 2006/7, then Great Western, if they are [due for] the next big upgrades. 'It is very difficult to build this new system into the existing patchwork of signalling.' Gisby said the company would 'think carefully' about possibly 'retro-fitting' the new system on the existing London-Brighton route or the Midland mainline, which runs via the East Midlands to Yorkshire, 'if we were not going to be upgrading them in the next couple of years'. Words like that prompt industry observers to warn it will be at least a decade before Britain has a decent high speed rail network with automatic safety systems. The Hidden Inquiry into the 1988 Clapham crash, which killed 35 people, recommended that ATP be fitted within five years to eliminate the high number of signals passed at danger (spads). The then Transport Secretary, Cecil Parkinson - a railwayman's son - promised the House of Commons in November 1989: 'Finance will not stand in the way of the implementation of the report.' He was backed by his Labour Shadow, John Prescott. But Parkinson, who called for speedy action, had moved to another job by the time his Conservative government colleagues and British Rail shelved the plans in 1994 - on financial grounds. They calculated that, with a \u00a3550 million price tag, ATP would cost up to \u00a314m for each potential life it saved. Investment on the railways is usually limited to \u00a32m per saved life. Safety spending on the roads, where more than 3,400 people are killed annually, is around \u00a3750,000 per life. While other EU states were modernising their railways in the Nineties, building new high-speed lines and fitting them with ATP, Britain limited its work to the Heathrow Express and the Channel Tunnel, and pushed through privatisation while the bulk of the network crumbled. Only limited ATP pilot schemes were ever introduced. Great Western notoriously had the system installed but not working, because of reliability problems, when its Swansea to London train went through a red light and smashed into a freight train at Southall, killing seven people. Carol Bell, who was injured and traumatised in that crash and is now a safety campaigner, is convinced that existing versions of ATP in use in Britain, other parts of Europe and the US should have been fitted throughout this country a long time ago - and still could be. She is supported by Mick Rix, general secretary of Aslef, which has launched the legal challenge to TPWS currently being aired at the inquiry. Bell is dismayed at the failure to fit ATP, compounded by the distinct lack of commitment to signing up for the new European system for the whole network. Campaigners dread that once TPWS is fitted, the industry will try to wriggle out of upgrading to the European system - even if the Cullen Inquiry into Paddington recommends it, European law encourages it and the Government provides cash towards the \u00a32bn cost. 'The sad thing is that \"only\" seven people died at Southall and although 31 deaths at Paddington was dreadful, if it had been the 200 feared at one point then I think there would have been drastic action on safety systems by now,' said Bell. Louise Christian, the solicitor leading the legal battle for the victims of both crashes, said TPWS should be scrapped in order to ensure the most expedient installation of the new European systems. But Sir David Davies, whose report on safety written earlier this year for the Government and accepted by Prescott as Deputy Prime Minister, said: 'The European system for the whole country would take at least nine years to fit, and most people say 15. TPWS can save lives sooner.' Safety campaigners warn there will have to be another crash before the warring parties agree about the best solution, let alone implement it. How the train protection systems compare Automatic Train Protection (ATP) How it works Generic term for computer-based automatic system. UK version consists of electronic messages from signalling system sent via cables in track or lineside unit to computer on train. Computer tells driver maximum safe speed based on route, speed limits, red signal ahead, etc. If permitted speed is exceeded, brakes are applied automatically. Up and running? Some form of ATP operating in most EU states. UK has ATP on part of Great Western and Chiltern lines, Heathrow Express and Eurostar trains in Channel Tunnel. Pros 98 per cent prevention of accidents caused by signals passed at red. Cons Existing ATP in UK cannot be upgraded to match forthcoming European systems. Difficult and expensive to fit to old trains, less reliable. Could take five-15 years. Cost Estimated between \u00a3550 million and \u00a32 billion to fit whole network. European Train Control System (ECTS) How it works Three levels of fully automatic system linking signalling system to onboard computer. Level One overlays existing signals and transmits data to train giving full ATP up to 180mph. Level Two has improved radio communications capability. Level Three does away with lineside signal and data kit. Train controlled via secure, digital radio links. Line capacity increased as trains can run closer together. Up and running? Level two currently being fitted to Vienna-Budapest line. Planned for UK West Coast Line by 2005. Further testing planned in Switzerland, France, Italy, Germany and Spain. Pros State of the art train protection and communications. Complies with new EU laws. Cons Difficult to retro-fit, therefore usually installed only when lines upgraded. Cost Estimated \u00a31.1billion-\u00a32bn. Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) How it works Cable loops in track transmit radio signals to unit in driver's cab. Brakes are automatically applied if train shoots red signal or goes too fast through speed trap set in advance of signal. Enhances existing UK Automatic Warning System (AWS) that rings bell in cab for green signal, sounds horn for yellow or red, applying brakes if driver does not respond. Up and running? Small-scale trials on part of Thameslink line since 1997. Plans to fit TPWS to all signals at junctions by the end of 2002, and to virtually all rolling stock by the end of 2003. Proposals to trial enhanced system for speeds up to 100mph. Pros Quicker, easier and cheaper to fit than ATP. Reasonably reliable. Cons Current system only effective up to 75mph. TPWS cannot be upgraded to meet new European standards. Cost \u00a3330m",

You would have thought that Ministers might have been worried about the exchange rate gyrations in recent years. On 5 October, Willem Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, reminded us that at the European Summit of December 1997 the Council of Ministers 'decided and made it public that so-called general orientations [for exchange rate policy] would only be issued in very exceptional circumstances'.

Trichet said: 'The success of the euro will yield a decisive contribution to an appropriate economic and monetary equilibrium in the world' and emphasised that the US, Japan and Europe were all 'vulnerable to a rather similar degree to adverse shocks occurring in the international financial system'. </p> <p>I am a great admirer of Trichet, and hope these remarks foreshadow rather greater leadership and sensitivity towards the world's economic imbalances than we have so far seen from the Euro X1. Buried in many a speech by the Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is the acknowledgement that, productivity miracle or not, the mounting US trade deficit could end in tears. </p> <p>The present signs of turmoil in world markets should be followed in due course by recognition of the urgent need for the G7 to build on recent intervention and work on currency stabilisation agreements, as it did in the mid-1980s. There may be a zone of monetary stability in Europe (the UK excluded), but we need target zones to limit the wild currency fluctuations around the world, and shore up that financial architecture.</p>",

Nevertheless, even the ECB was prepared to sign up to the G7 statement indicating that the intervention was not just about European price stability but reflected 'shared concern of Finance Ministers and Governors about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy'. This point was emphasised last week by Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, in another London lecture, given under the auspices of South Bank University's Journal of Common Market Studies. Trichet said: 'The success of the euro will yield a decisive contribution to an appropriate economic and monetary equilibrium in the world' and emphasised that the US, Japan and Europe were all 'vulnerable to a rather similar degree to adverse shocks occurring in the international financial system'. I am a great admirer of Trichet, and hope these remarks foreshadow rather greater leadership and sensitivity towards the world's economic imbalances than we have so far seen from the Euro X1. Buried in many a speech by the Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is the acknowledgement that, productivity miracle or not, the mounting US trade deficit could end in tears. The present signs of turmoil in world markets should be followed in due course by recognition of the urgent need for the G7 to build on recent intervention and work on currency stabilisation agreements, as it did in the mid-1980s. There may be a zone of monetary stability in Europe (the UK excluded), but we need target zones to limit the wild currency fluctuations around the world, and shore up that financial architecture.",

Never mind the ruthlessly slick, robotically executed, coldly professional Wembley show I attended last week with my daughter, it is as if Spears's entire life has been choreographed, airbrushed, styled and marketed for the masses. The question is: why are we buying into it? </p> <p>Something has to explain Spears's success, beyond the insatiable desire of dirty old men for singing virgins with pigtails and tit jobs (though you should never underestimate the rainmac pound). Something else must be going on with Britney Inc besides appealing to confused young girls with throwback cheerleader fantasies. Or bigger boys who tend to be 'fans' of any female star whose buttocks don't actually drag along the floor. After all, here we have an 18-year-old, seemingly unburdened by interesting opinions, anything resembling a sense of originality, or excessive amounts of charisma or talent. And yet, one way or the other, the world can't get enough of her. To paraphrase The Rutles, could it just be a matter of tight rubber catsuits? </p> <p>All the hard evidence suggests that, rather than talent, a combination of drive, hard graft, and planning is the bedrock of Britney Spears's success. This is what she has over the vulnerable, far more talented and human Christina Aguilera, the dozy Mandy Moore, and clapped-out-before-20 Billie Piper. Observing these near-babies lamely mugging at the cameras with softly pornographic intensity, you half expect staples to spontaneously appear on their midriffs, mid-dance routine. Nevertheless it is Britney, the Louisiana baptist who doesn't even put out , who gets to queen it over the lot of them, zapping the opposition with her formidable drive and determination. </p> <p>However much Aguilera et al might aspire to the Britney stratosphere of fame, they simply haven't got what it takes to eclipse this Sherman tank with pom-poms. All of which would be very admirable, if Ms Spears could only remember to send down to room service for a sense of humour occasionally. Even her greatest supporters would have to admit that Britney is an irony-free zone. Indeed, if I was Madonna, I'd be insulted by Spears's oft-quoted statement that she has taken the Ciccone career plan as her template. Say what you like about Madge but at least she's provided the odd punchline to life's great cultural anomalies and psycho-sexual inconsistencies. Britney is too busy writhing, wailing and grunting herself puce to even hear the joke. </p> <p>Having said that, I was guilty of losing my own sense of humour during Britney's show at Wembley Arena. It makes no sense to rant about expensive merchandising when every artist in town is guilty of over-pricing their tacky bric-a-brac, but_ \u00a320 for a five-inch teddy bear, wearing a 'Britney' T-shirt? I thought Britney was born to make us happy, not bankrupt. Told she couldn't have the teddy bear, my daughter sulked thunderously and refused to share her candy floss, as we sat in our seats waiting for Britney to take the stage. </p> <p>The sell-out crowd was brilliant, it has to be said, revving up the atmosphere with chants and 'Brit Chicks' placards, and coordinating the best Mexican wave I've ever seen outside a football stadium. Some of the older teenage girls wore sassy 'Baby, Hit Me One More Time'-inspired schoolgirl uniforms. The more daring ones kept bending over and flashing their knickers at red-faced boys. All very reconstituted St Trinians, but amusing none the less. Prom-queen sexy and confident, pigtails streaming, and with that lollipop-sucking cod-innocence down to a tee, you had to admit that these girls did a very good 'Britney'. In fact, an hour or so into the Spears spectacular, it was arguable that certain sectors of the audience were doing 'Britney' far better than she was doing herself. </p> <p>For a start, where was she? Call me old-fashioned, but when I go and see an artist perform, I expect said artist to be on the stage more often than she is off it. While we got all the hits - 'Baby', 'Crazy', 'Oops', 'Sometimes', and the rest of her fabled oeuvre - Britney had a habit of only showing up halfway through her songs, or disappearing before the end of them for yet another costume change, leaving the audience staring mystified at sparkly staircases, space-pods, and an army of dancers wriggling about irritatingly. This happened so frequently, you felt ridiculously grateful when Britney deigned to appear at all. When she did, more often than not, a giant screen simultaneously ran through excerpts of her videos, reducing the experience to an MTV marathon, with the odd 'live' element thrown in. </p> <p>This wouldn't do at all if Britney were to marry her most famous admirer, Prince William. She couldn't rush off halfway through a royal walkabout, leaving a pile of videos to finish the job. Nor could Queen Britney get away with lounging around in little girl fluffy slippers in a creepy Disney-style bedroom like some pederast fantasy from Winnie the Pooh, or sitting on a throne, writhing 'lustily' and pulling 'horny' faces, as she did during her so-terrible-it's-almost-good rendition of the Stones' 'Satisfaction'. The Spears voice, never good when it strays too far from the distorting machine, was reasonable, only wobbling disastrously during the ballads. </p> <p>When the screen wasn't promoting her videos, the cameras panned on to Britney, showing her as she was 'LIVE!' on stage - which was a mistake. Not many of us would come off well if a camera were to be stuck into our faces and the result beamed out 30ft high. However, considering that she's only 18, and paid to be 'young and beautiful', it has to be said that Britney looked dog-rough at Wembley; not old or ugly, just wearier than God. While her body looked great, her hair extensions needed redoing, and her skin looked baked and exhausted. Good God girl, I thought, if this is what fame is doing to you, get a rest, have some time off. At one point, swathed in a gown at the top of a sparkly staircase, thanking her fans for 'making everything possible', Britney looked less the millionaire Lolita than she did a 40-year-old diva divorcee trying to scratch a living on a cruise ship. </p> <p>At the end of this segment, Britney disappeared once more, leaving behind her silver train. The irresistible metaphor would be that that of a major talent emerging from her latest chrysalis to further realise her dreams. However, in the very special case of Britney Spears, she seems to be less living a 'dream' than she is fulfilling her duties as the public face of her marketing team's fantasies for world domination. And you wonder how much longer it can last, how long Spears can exhaust herself trying to be the perfectly pitched millennial pop dream. Then you realise that with an artist as pathologically determined as Britney Spears, the answer is probably forever and a day. Not by accident but by design. 'Oops' just doesn't come into it.</p>",

      "body": "<b> Robbie Williams</b> Birmingham NEC <p> The Sexiest Man in the World skulks dreamily onstage on the second night of his fourth UK tour, not in the alluring black zip-up catsuit he squeezed into the night before but in a dead drab get-up of baggy jeans, trainers and beige T-shirt. Robbie explained that he saw the pics in the press and thought he looked like a 'pillock', a bit of an Alvin Stardust joke, so decided to go to the opposite extreme and dress down completely. </p> <p>Having had our expectations teased by the gig's opening blasts of blinding pyrotechnics and the spectacle of the entire 'backing' band - stage, equipment and all - being lowered from the rafters, Robbie's new dress policy comes as a very serious disappointment. We want our pop icons to look the part, to set them apart from this mortal mob. The stage is no place to slob about. You're a superstar, Mr Williams - please dress like one, for God's sake! </p> <p>As a consolation, Robbie presents us early with his party piece: wiggling his bubble-butt at the crowd not more than 30 seconds into the opening number, 'Let Me Entertain You'. After a dazzling series of fireworks, the song ends with a nice series of power-pop chords and off he slopes in butch-boy strut, all fake grimaces and sneers. </p> <p>Robbie's bulky midtempos (and bulging mid-tenderloin) are more aligned with the human pulse than, say, handbag, hardcore or hip-hop, and therefore indicative of his democratic spirit.

      "bodyText": "Robbie Williams Birmingham NEC The Sexiest Man in the World skulks dreamily onstage on the second night of his fourth UK tour, not in the alluring black zip-up catsuit he squeezed into the night before but in a dead drab get-up of baggy jeans, trainers and beige T-shirt. Robbie explained that he saw the pics in the press and thought he looked like a 'pillock', a bit of an Alvin Stardust joke, so decided to go to the opposite extreme and dress down completely. Having had our expectations teased by the gig's opening blasts of blinding pyrotechnics and the spectacle of the entire 'backing' band - stage, equipment and all - being lowered from the rafters, Robbie's new dress policy comes as a very serious disappointment. We want our pop icons to look the part, to set them apart from this mortal mob. The stage is no place to slob about. You're a superstar, Mr Williams - please dress like one, for God's sake! As a consolation, Robbie presents us early with his party piece: wiggling his bubble-butt at the crowd not more than 30 seconds into the opening number, 'Let Me Entertain You'. After a dazzling series of fireworks, the song ends with a nice series of power-pop chords and off he slopes in butch-boy strut, all fake grimaces and sneers. Robbie's bulky midtempos (and bulging mid-tenderloin) are more aligned with the human pulse than, say, handbag, hardcore or hip-hop, and therefore indicative of his democratic spirit. His devoted Take That hang-on fans, along with the footie-lad gang and Britpop bores, take Robbie at face value, drinking up the heroic gestures and piss-taking rhetoric; the gay fans, numerous to judge by this crowd, see him as nothing more than a big tease - and embrace him for it.

Parnell, David Kaff, Tony Hendra </p> <p> Zhang Yimou, who made his reputation with Red Sorghum, Ju Dou, Raise the Red Lantern and Shanghai Triad, four of the Chinese cinema's most aesthetically elegant movies, has deliberately turned his back on anything resembling Hollywood-style technical sophistication. In an attempt to revive neo-realism and match the current work of Iranian filmmakers, he's made two simple, low-budget movies, Not One Less and <strong> The Road Home</strong>, both celebrating the lives of honest peasants and centring on teachers. </p> <p>The title of The Road Home has several meanings. In the present (shot in a cold, blue-tinged monochrome), Luo, a successful young businessman, returns for the first time in years to his remote native village to attend the funeral of his father, a revered primary school teacher. The father died in hospital some distance away and his mother is determined that his body should be carried back home through the snow by a party of mourners according to ancient tradition, borne along the road which first brought him to the village. </p> <p>In an extended flashback, shot in soft, nostalgic colour, we see the father's arrival 40 years ago and his courtship of the now elderly mother, who was then the village beauty. This was during the idealistic early days of the Revolution when there was no electricity or running water, but a great deal of hope. Now there are modern conveniences, but the young leave for the city, and on the wall beside a traditional print is the Chinese poster for James Cameron's Titanic. It's a sentimental, warm-hearted movie, calculatedly simple, that celebrates love in a cold political climate, the consolations of community, the power of education, and the small things in life. </p> <p>The gap between The Road Home and <strong> Road Trip</strong> is greater than the width of the Pacific Ocean. This is the latest Farrelly-inspired comedy, an example of the New Vulgarity that makes Animal House look as reserved as Coward's Hay Fever. The plot turns on a student at Ithaca in upper New York State accidentally sending his girlfriend at the University of Texas, Austin, a video of himself having sex with a co-ed instead of the intended innocuous love letter. So with four assorted chums, whose all-encompassing interests are drugs, booze, partying and sex, he drives south to retrieve it. Along the way they steal a bus from a blind school, sell sperm to a fertility clinic, get high with a senior citizen who has a permanent erection induced by Viagra, and one of them loses his virginity to a gargantuan black girl in Tennessee. It is just possible that Road Trip is setting out to parody the genre, and Tom Green is very funny as its unreliable narrator. </p> <p><strong> Dinosaur</strong> is the Disney Studio's latest animated movie combining live-action footage and computer-generated imagery to tell the tale of a herd of prehistoric monsters making an epic journey across difficult terrain to their idyllic nesting grounds. Technically it's astonishing. Dramatically, it's dire. The original screenplay is by Walon Green, screenwriter on The Wild Bunch and The Hi-Lo Country, and is in effect a re-working of Red River with the Montgomery Clift role going to a thoughtful young iguanadon called Aladar, and John Wayne's tough leader becoming the bull-headed leader, Kron. Socially these creatures, along with a family of chatty monkeys that accompany them, have evolved beyond anything Darwin could have imagined, indeed beyond Darwin himself. They all talk and act exactly like twenty-first century Californian suburbanites. </p> <p>The ferocious Dinosaur and the mild <strong> Tom's Midnight Garden</strong> both feature Joan Plowright. As a half-term treat, kids are likely to thank you for taking them to the former, and to make life tough for you should you inflict on them the latter. This is a screen version of Philippa Pearce's classic fantasy, published more than 40 years ago, about a middle-class lad travelling through time to meet a little orphan girl in a Victorian country house outside Ely. There are touching and magical moments, but generally it's overlong, confused, repetitive, oddly dislocated, and not a patch on the cherished book. </p> <p>The directorial debut of the excellent Polish-Ameri can cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak, <strong> Romeo Must Die</strong>, is a vehicle for Chinese martial arts star Jet Li, who made his American debut two years ago as the heavy in Lethal Weapon 4 . Here he plays a wrongly imprisoned Hong Kong cop who escapes to avenge the death of his brother, killed in an interracial gang war in Oakland. The choreography is better than the scenario. </p> <p>Rob Reiner's 1983 directorial debut, a murderously accurate parody of a cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 -style rockumentary about a disintegrating British rock band on their last US tour, is back in cinemas, looking and sounding better than ever. The accents are impeccable and Reiner is hilarious as a bearded movie-brat director. In the past 17 years, the movie has developed a cult following and accreted its own legend. This is recorded in the accompanying <strong> This Is Spinal Tap</strong>: The Official Companion (Bloomsbury \u00a316.99) which contains a prepilogue by Michael McKean (who plays David St Hubbins), the script, a Tap'istory, the band's lyrics, and a 185-page A-Z guide to the movie full of extraordinary, often arcane, information. I should declare an interest here or, more correctly, admit a responsibility, because the A-Z is by Karl French, whom I forced to attend cinemas on a regular basis between the ages of four and 19, when he saw the press show of This Is Spinal Tap and left home for good. </p> <p>Had I not done so, or had the experience worked as aversion therapy, he might now be a prison warder, a spin doctor, a futures trader, or following some other socially useful calling.</p>",

Nicole Kidman, Kathleen Turner and Jerry Hall have all stripped, but this week Daryl Hannah and Greta Scacchi made poised appearances, memorable because of what they donned rather than what they shucked. In both cases, the frocks they appeared in were more notable than the plays. </p> <p>What does anyone remember of Billy Wilder's 1955 film of <strong> The Seven Year Itch</strong>? Always and only the picture of Marilyn Monroe, her pleated skirt blown up around her thighs by a subway vent, her face split by a grin. What will anyone remember of Michael Radford's feeble production of the play? Nothing, probably, in 40 years' time, but - for a few weeks - the image of Daryl Hannah as a taller, paler, more slender version of Monroe. Hannah takes the part of the ditsy girl upstairs who, having dropped a plant pot on to her married neighbour's balcony, becomes the subject of his fantasies and eventually his lover. She provides the only bearable moments in the evening: she has a comic touch and a wonderful wardrobe of pedal-pushers and New Look sticking-out dresses. </p> <p>But this is the sort of occasion that gives the West End a bad name: cravenly using a current star's name in an attempt to make a ghastly bag of bones of a piece look as if it had a point. It doesn't. Its idea of a joke is to hear a man orgasmically groaning as he pops a champagne cork. </p> <p>Ferenc Molnar's play <strong> The Guardsman</strong>, first staged in 1910, is far more worthy of revival - but Janet Suzman's production is nowhere near dark enough to do it justice. </p> <p>The plot hinges on an erotic enticement. On Cos\u00ec fan tutte lines, a jealous husband - an actor married to an actress - disguises himself as a guardsman (this is Hungary before the First World War) and pays dashing court to his wife. She seems ready to submit to his advances, but on the brink of seduction the couple are reconciled when it turns out that - or so she declares - the wife knew him all along. </p> <p>It's not a play for which great claims can be made, but it could move with the sinister tinkle of a musical box. It has the interest of being a performance about performance, with husband and wife needing to keep the audience guessing to the end about the penetrability of disguise in a world which is wholly theatrical. The second act takes place in a box at the opera, where in Frank Marcus's version Lucia di Lammermoor is being performed (in Molnar's original, the opera was Madam Butterfly); the urbane and manipulative confidant of both husband and wife, who maliciously whips the game along, is a theatre critic. </p> <p>It should also contain a sexual charge: there's a strong suggestion that one of the things the wife was after was sex with a man in a helmet. But though Greta Scacchi proves to be a mistress of the moue , there's no spark between her and Michael Pennington's over-blustery buffoon of a husband, and altogether too much geniality and archness. What's missing is the anxiety that prompts the action and gives it an edge. The frocks again cut a dash, with Scacchi swathed in silver and in folds of caramel silk, but if you want soft furnishings, you might as well go to John Lewis. </p> <p>There aren't likely to be many stars in satin at the BAC's annual <strong> British Festival of Visual Theatre</strong>. But there's always something that shines like gold. It was here that Complicite showed early fragments of their wonderful Mnemomic , and Improbable Theatre devised some of their most dazzling transformations - shows to lift the heart of anyone normally chilled by the idea of experiments in form. </p> <p>This year, Toby Jones's Wanted Man, a lightly delivered but penetrating two-hander, pulled off the trick that The Guardsman fluffs: that of making an audience believe in a transparent disguise. Together, a furrowed Jones and Edward Woodall turned a piece of storytelling into a drama - and a potting-shed in Isleworth into a poolside party. They deservedly did so to a packed house. </p> <p>The only thing wrong with the festival is its name: 'visual' is particularly inappropriate for an event which includes an amiable dream play by Primitive Science throughout which the audience sit in total darkness. What's really meant is theatre you don't regularly get elsewhere, theatre which is not at all like having a book read - or roared - at you. It attracts an audience two decades younger than any in the West End.</p>",

She seems ready to submit to his advances, but on the brink of seduction the couple are reconciled when it turns out that - or so she declares - the wife knew him all along. It's not a play for which great claims can be made, but it could move with the sinister tinkle of a musical box. It has the interest of being a performance about performance, with husband and wife needing to keep the audience guessing to the end about the penetrability of disguise in a world which is wholly theatrical. The second act takes place in a box at the opera, where in Frank Marcus's version Lucia di Lammermoor is being performed (in Molnar's original, the opera was Madam Butterfly); the urbane and manipulative confidant of both husband and wife, who maliciously whips the game along, is a theatre critic. It should also contain a sexual charge: there's a strong suggestion that one of the things the wife was after was sex with a man in a helmet. But though Greta Scacchi proves to be a mistress of the moue , there's no spark between her and Michael Pennington's over-blustery buffoon of a husband, and altogether too much geniality and archness. What's missing is the anxiety that prompts the action and gives it an edge. The frocks again cut a dash, with Scacchi swathed in silver and in folds of caramel silk, but if you want soft furnishings, you might as well go to John Lewis. There aren't likely to be many stars in satin at the BAC's annual British Festival of Visual Theatre. But there's always something that shines like gold. It was here that Complicite showed early fragments of their wonderful Mnemomic , and Improbable Theatre devised some of their most dazzling transformations - shows to lift the heart of anyone normally chilled by the idea of experiments in form. This year, Toby Jones's Wanted Man, a lightly delivered but penetrating two-hander, pulled off the trick that The Guardsman fluffs: that of making an audience believe in a transparent disguise. Together, a furrowed Jones and Edward Woodall turned a piece of storytelling into a drama - and a potting-shed in Isleworth into a poolside party. They deservedly did so to a packed house. The only thing wrong with the festival is its name: 'visual' is particularly inappropriate for an event which includes an amiable dream play by Primitive Science throughout which the audience sit in total darkness. What's really meant is theatre you don't regularly get elsewhere, theatre which is not at all like having a book read - or roared - at you. It attracts an audience two decades younger than any in the West End.",

      "body": "<p><strong> The House of Mirth </strong> (140 mins, PG) Directed by Terence Davies; starring Gillian Anderson, Eric Stoltz, Dan Aykroyd, Anthony LaPaglia </p> <p>In 1937, the year Edith Wharton died aged 75, her work was consigned to oblivion by the left-wing critic, Herbert J. Muller, in his Modern Fiction: a Study in Values. He conceded that in The House of Mirth she 'made what in its day [1905] seemed a daringly realistic study of high society'. But after finding a few words of praise for Ethan Frome, her single excursion into working-class life, Muller declared that 'the bulk of her work concerns the doings of pallid gentlefolk and soon acquires the mustiness that has already sent The House of Mirth to the attic'. </p> <p>Well, Wharton and her books have long been recovered from the attic and the two most famous of them have been filmed with great distinction by Martin Scorsese and Terence Davies, blue-collar Catholics far removed from the patrician, Wasp world of Edith Wharton. Both have seen in her books the subtle perception and unflinching honesty of a writer who, from a position of confident success and social acceptance, could observe the hypocrisy, false values and cruelty of her own class. To write trenchantly, vividly on one society is to illuminate the idea of society in general. </p> <p>As he's demonstrated in the movies inspired by his Liverpool childhood and the non-autobiographical Neon Bible, Davies has a tragic, or at least stoical, view of life, and it was clearly not to escape from his customary gloom that he chose to film The House of Mirth. </p> <p>The title, which misleadingly suggests a funfair attraction, comes from Ecclesiastes ('The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; the heart of fools is in the house of mirth') and Edith Wharton regretted having adapted her first major literary success for the stage. 'I now doubt if that kind of a play, with a \"sad\" ending and a negative hero, could ever get a hearing from an American audience,' she wrote during its very brief Broadway run. In consoling her as they left the theatre, the critic and novelist William Dean Howells famously remarked: 'What the American public always wants is a tragedy with a happy ending.' </p> <p>The 29-year-old Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) follows on from Emma Bovary, Anna Karenina and Isobel Archer in the nineteenth-century tradition of self-deceiving heroines destroyed through a combination of oppressive social conventions and their own wilfulness. Lily is a 29-year-old orphan, beautiful, intelligent, witty, but dependent upon an allowance from a rich aunt and expected to secure her place in upper-class New York through marrying a rich man. </p> <p>This is a society in transition (old money is being challenged, or inveigled, by the nouveaux riches ) that plays a deadly game with complex, unwritten rules which have nothing to do with ethics or morality. The consequences for losers are ostracism and banishment. </p> <p>Following Wharton's book with intelligent fidelity, the film goes to the heart of the matter with a superb opening encounter between Lily and her confidant, Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz), a hard-working lawyer with no inherited money. Like her, he lives through the hospitality of the rich. They love each other, but her ambition and his diffidence keep them apart.

      "bodyText": "The House of Mirth (140 mins, PG) Directed by Terence Davies; starring Gillian Anderson, Eric Stoltz, Dan Aykroyd, Anthony LaPaglia In 1937, the year Edith Wharton died aged 75, her work was consigned to oblivion by the left-wing critic, Herbert J. Muller, in his Modern Fiction: a Study in Values. He conceded that in The House of Mirth she 'made what in its day [1905] seemed a daringly realistic study of high society'. But after finding a few words of praise for Ethan Frome, her single excursion into working-class life, Muller declared that 'the bulk of her work concerns the doings of pallid gentlefolk and soon acquires the mustiness that has already sent The House of Mirth to the attic'. Well, Wharton and her books have long been recovered from the attic and the two most famous of them have been filmed with great distinction by Martin Scorsese and Terence Davies, blue-collar Catholics far removed from the patrician, Wasp world of Edith Wharton. Both have seen in her books the subtle perception and unflinching honesty of a writer who, from a position of confident success and social acceptance, could observe the hypocrisy, false values and cruelty of her own class. To write trenchantly, vividly on one society is to illuminate the idea of society in general. As he's demonstrated in the movies inspired by his Liverpool childhood and the non-autobiographical Neon Bible, Davies has a tragic, or at least stoical, view of life, and it was clearly not to escape from his customary gloom that he chose to film The House of Mirth. The title, which misleadingly suggests a funfair attraction, comes from Ecclesiastes ('The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; the heart of fools is in the house of mirth') and Edith Wharton regretted having adapted her first major literary success for the stage. 'I now doubt if that kind of a play, with a \"sad\" ending and a negative hero, could ever get a hearing from an American audience,' she wrote during its very brief Broadway run. In consoling her as they left the theatre, the critic and novelist William Dean Howells famously remarked: 'What the American public always wants is a tragedy with a happy ending.' The 29-year-old Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) follows on from Emma Bovary, Anna Karenina and Isobel Archer in the nineteenth-century tradition of self-deceiving heroines destroyed through a combination of oppressive social conventions and their own wilfulness. Lily is a 29-year-old orphan, beautiful, intelligent, witty, but dependent upon an allowance from a rich aunt and expected to secure her place in upper-class New York through marrying a rich man. This is a society in transition (old money is being challenged, or inveigled, by the nouveaux riches ) that plays a deadly game with complex, unwritten rules which have nothing to do with ethics or morality. The consequences for losers are ostracism and banishment. Following Wharton's book with intelligent fidelity, the film goes to the heart of the matter with a superb opening encounter between Lily and her confidant, Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz), a hard-working lawyer with no inherited money. Like her, he lives through the hospitality of the rich. They love each other, but her ambition and his diffidence keep them apart. This lean sequence, which establishes character, milieu and values, concludes with Lily leaving Selden's apartment block and lying to its owner, the suave financier Rosedale (Anthony LaPaglia), that she's been seeing her dressmaker. This is the first of several hostages to fortune. As Davies forgoes an authorial commentary (one of the strengths of Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence, where Joanne Woodward spoke for Wharton), we are not told that Rosedale is a Jew. Viewers who haven't read the book may think him merely an edgily ambitious arriviste and not be aware that Lily shares the conventional anti-Semitism of her class. Though both Lily and Selden see through, and wittily mock, this society, they're trapped within it, in Lily's case because she lacks the skills and the political vision to break away. Ultimately, she's brought down and sent to an early grave by her decency, her vulnerability and her honesty. She rejects several wealthy suitors, falls into the hands of the blackmailing would-be seducer, Gus Trenor (Dan Aykroyd), is manipulated by a treacherous friend, the adulterous Bertha Dorset (Laura Linney) and cheated by a hypocritical cousin, (Jodhi May). To tell this complex story, Davies steers a course somewhere between the luxurious explicitness of Merchant-Ivory - whose admirable, not dissimilar, The Golden Bowl opens next month - and the metaphoric, elliptical, expressionist style of his previous pictures. The action proceeds through a succession of dialogues where, except in the exchanges between Lily and Selden, the real subject under discussion only occasionally disrupts the polite surface.

Should the couple divorce, Jones will gain at least \u00a31 million for every year of marriage. And to show that Douglas (worth \u00a3150m) and his bride are not mercenary, there will be no wedding presents. Guests will, instead, be encouraged to make out cheques to a charitable trust in Dylan's name so that he may learn about the 'joys of giving'. It could be argued that what Dylan is actually about to learn from his parents is quite different - it's about holding on to what you have.</p> <p>Pre-nuptial agreements have been popular in Hollywood for the past decade (think of Michael Jackson and Debbie Rowe, Donald Trump and Ivana, Ted Turner and Jane Fonda). But it is not only Hollywood that is becoming more grasping - or cautious (depending upon your point of view). And in Britain, which has the highest divorce rate in Europe, it should not come as a surprise that pre-nuptial agreements are becoming increasingly common. They tend to involve wealthy people or those getting married for a second time (once bitten, twice tight).</p> <p>According to James Harcus, a family partner at the law firm Withers, it would make sense even for those who marry without much money (they may, after all, earn handsomely later on) to think about drawing up a pre-nuptial agreement. 'England is the only country in the civilised world where pre-nuptial agreements are not legally binding,' Harcus points out. This would have changed if New Labour had had its way. Its consultation paper 'Supporting Families' (1998) expressed concern about divorce and the enormous legal costs involved and welcomed pre-nuptial agreements, as sensible pre-emptive measures, recommending that they be recognised by the courts.</p> <p>The recommendation has since been thrown out by the judiciary. According to Harcus, British courts tend not to respect pre-nuptial agreements, often awarding wives more than their husbands bargained for. Could this be an expression of moral disapprobation? 'That is my impression,' said Harcus.</p> <p>To form a pre-nuptial agreement, a couple may not seek advice from the same lawyer: each is separately represented. It is, from the first, an adversarial situation. Harcus admits that he knows of cases where the marriage had to be called off because of the hostilities involved or because 'it took such a long time to complete the process that the couple's ardour cooled'.</p> <p>Is the court right to disapprove of pre-nuptials? Are they really so morally objectionable? Gina White, who has recently married, thinks they suggest 'divorce in miniature. Or making a will - it is like planning the death of your marriage. But the difference is that all lives end, while only some marriages do.' So why the growing impulse to draw up such agreements? 'I think people are twisting the idea of a compensation culture, trying to compensate themselves for an unhappy marriage before it has even happened.' She adds: 'They want a safety net before there is any danger. I think it is a control freak impulse. I think we live in a society tormented by the wish to predict the unpredictable, manage the uncontrollable.</p> <p>'Perhaps God's low profile is to blame. Everyone knows that control freaks are running scared, trying to contain their own chaos.'</p> <p>Pre-nuptial agreements imply ungenerous provision. The generous optimist would never be drawn to such a contract. Or would they? A recent NOP poll claimed that a quarter of the population is in favour of pre-nuptial agreements (I wasn't consulted, were you?). It also maintained that Londoners were especially cautious lovers.

'When I first married I would never have compromised my feelings by considering such an agreement, because of the implication: this is not going to last, this is not made for us, this marriage is made for the law. The grinning skull of the law would have disfigured the face of my marriage.' Roberts admits, though, that his father used to warn him: 'Beware of fortune hunters. Remember Kashoggi!'</p> <p>Annabel Harris is not married yet, but believes that before she marries she will have to make 'the hardest pre-nuptial agreement of all: the decision to live together'. She thinks that any further agreement suggests you are in doubt about each other. 'A pre-nuptial agreement is like taking out buildings insurance; you are treating your marriage shabbily, as if it were a leaky, vulnerable house. Marriage ought to aim high - otherwise why bother?'</p> <p>Sheila Sullivan, author of Falling in Love - a History of Torment and Enchantment, has studied love in many of its manifestations throughout history. Does she think that pre-nuptial agreements are antipathetic to the state of being in love? Her answer is surprising. She concedes that couples madly in love would not be able to 'conceive of love ending' and would find all thoughts of money 'sordid' (to the extent that if one of them were to raise the idea of a pre-nuptial agreement, the relationship would probably founder).</p> <p>But she goes on to say that 'couples in a cooler, more rational frame of mind (in love - but not madly so) might be able to take a more realistic view of the future of their relationship, and would probably not be damaged by sensible thoughts about money or future separation.'

      "body": "<p>Win the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture at the right point in your career, and it's a triumph. Get it too late, and it's a heavy hint that the time has come to shuffle off the stage to make way for another generation. When Jorn Utzon won the award for the Sydney Opera House in 1980, he said: 'If you like an architect's work, you give him something to build, not a medal.' After Le Corbusier got the medal he went back to Maxwell Fry's house and, according to Charles Jencks's new biography, drank himself under the table, accompanied by a beautiful female companion. </p> <p>If there is one architect who has managed to design a landmark building with the same popular power as Utzon's opera house, it is Frank Gehry, who will be collecting the gold medal at the banqueting house in Whitehall on Wednesday. But Gehry can afford to take a more relaxed view than Utzon, and a more sober one than Le Corbusier. He was a late starter, toiling away in big commercial practices that specialised in shopping centres, and struggling for years on his own, before designing the Guggenheim in Bilbao. And that was only the beginning of Gehry's career as a mainstream figure. At 71 he has never been busier. He is building a new concert hall in Los Angeles. He has designed a new Guggenheim museum in Manhattan twice the size of his Bilbao outpost, and was in the running to build a skyscraper for the New York Times incorporating a 10-storey base decorated with giant fragments of the newspaper's masthead. 'It would have been a great building, but I pulled out. I could see that I wasn't going to be able to work with the Times's developers without a fight and I am getting too tired at my age to fight. Most people at my stage look for the bigger projects, I've gone the other way.' In Berlin he has just completed a spectacular bank, and there are projects in Brazil, Panama, Germany, the Czech Republic and the UK - the latter being an innovative cancer counselling centre built in memory of his friend, Maggie Jencks. </p> <p>Architects have traditionally enjoyed long careers - Frank Lloyd Wright completed the first great Guggenheim building when was 90. But Gehry is aware of the need to use the time he has left effectively. He is probably the most famous architect in the world, which means he is inundated with projects large and small from every ambitious city, manufacturer and retailer desperate for a piece of the Bilbao glamour. Paul Allen, Bill Gates's one-time partner at Microsoft, indulged his passion for Jimi Hendrix by having Gehry design the $240 million Experience Music Project in Seattle. </p> <p>Gehry, who has the rumpled affability of a Californian Woody Allen, makes an unlikely architectural guru. He is blessed with a self-deprecating irony of a kind not usually associated with American architects. Nor does he show any interest in the opaque language of structuralism that plagues so much contemporary industry discussion. He is allergic to corporate practice. Gehry is a shirt-sleeves kind of a guy, at his happiest messing around in a workshop with a blunt pencil and some yellow drafting paper. He used to make cardboard furniture with his own hands. And he spent a lot of time hanging out with artists such as Claes Oldenburg. They worked together on the offices of an advertising agency in Los Angeles, and came up with a design that incorporated a five- storey (habitable) pair of Oldenburg binoculars in the heart of the building. Subsequently, Gehry began to treat all architecture as art. He developed an obsession with fish imagery, building a restaurant in Japan in the shape of a giant carp, and creating a fish out of steel mesh on the Barcelona waterfront. He has an artist's wariness of offering too many apologies for his work. Why make a building look like a fish? 'Oh I don't know, I just kind of liked it.' </p> <p>Gehry was born in Canada, moving to Los Angeles with his family when still very young. He is the most considerable architectural talent to emerge from the city since Charles Eames in the 1950s, and the first to have evolved an architecture from the context of LA, rather than importing it from somewhere else. With its seemingly random collisions of shapes, and odd juxtapositions, Gehry's architecture accepts its context. When you are surrounded by freeways, giant advertising signs, and drive-in restaurants in the shape of giant bowler hats, or hot dogs, there is not much point trying to build chaste, well-mannered European style buildings. But if Gehry was uncrowned architect laureate of Los Angeles, it clearly rankled that he didn't get the prize commissions.

      "bodyText": "Win the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture at the right point in your career, and it's a triumph. Get it too late, and it's a heavy hint that the time has come to shuffle off the stage to make way for another generation. When Jorn Utzon won the award for the Sydney Opera House in 1980, he said: 'If you like an architect's work, you give him something to build, not a medal.' After Le Corbusier got the medal he went back to Maxwell Fry's house and, according to Charles Jencks's new biography, drank himself under the table, accompanied by a beautiful female companion. If there is one architect who has managed to design a landmark building with the same popular power as Utzon's opera house, it is Frank Gehry, who will be collecting the gold medal at the banqueting house in Whitehall on Wednesday. But Gehry can afford to take a more relaxed view than Utzon, and a more sober one than Le Corbusier. He was a late starter, toiling away in big commercial practices that specialised in shopping centres, and struggling for years on his own, before designing the Guggenheim in Bilbao. And that was only the beginning of Gehry's career as a mainstream figure. At 71 he has never been busier. He is building a new concert hall in Los Angeles. He has designed a new Guggenheim museum in Manhattan twice the size of his Bilbao outpost, and was in the running to build a skyscraper for the New York Times incorporating a 10-storey base decorated with giant fragments of the newspaper's masthead. 'It would have been a great building, but I pulled out. I could see that I wasn't going to be able to work with the Times's developers without a fight and I am getting too tired at my age to fight. Most people at my stage look for the bigger projects, I've gone the other way.' In Berlin he has just completed a spectacular bank, and there are projects in Brazil, Panama, Germany, the Czech Republic and the UK - the latter being an innovative cancer counselling centre built in memory of his friend, Maggie Jencks. Architects have traditionally enjoyed long careers - Frank Lloyd Wright completed the first great Guggenheim building when was 90. But Gehry is aware of the need to use the time he has left effectively. He is probably the most famous architect in the world, which means he is inundated with projects large and small from every ambitious city, manufacturer and retailer desperate for a piece of the Bilbao glamour. Paul Allen, Bill Gates's one-time partner at Microsoft, indulged his passion for Jimi Hendrix by having Gehry design the $240 million Experience Music Project in Seattle. Gehry, who has the rumpled affability of a Californian Woody Allen, makes an unlikely architectural guru. He is blessed with a self-deprecating irony of a kind not usually associated with American architects. Nor does he show any interest in the opaque language of structuralism that plagues so much contemporary industry discussion. He is allergic to corporate practice. Gehry is a shirt-sleeves kind of a guy, at his happiest messing around in a workshop with a blunt pencil and some yellow drafting paper. He used to make cardboard furniture with his own hands. And he spent a lot of time hanging out with artists such as Claes Oldenburg. They worked together on the offices of an advertising agency in Los Angeles, and came up with a design that incorporated a five- storey (habitable) pair of Oldenburg binoculars in the heart of the building. Subsequently, Gehry began to treat all architecture as art. He developed an obsession with fish imagery, building a restaurant in Japan in the shape of a giant carp, and creating a fish out of steel mesh on the Barcelona waterfront. He has an artist's wariness of offering too many apologies for his work. Why make a building look like a fish? 'Oh I don't know, I just kind of liked it.' Gehry was born in Canada, moving to Los Angeles with his family when still very young. He is the most considerable architectural talent to emerge from the city since Charles Eames in the 1950s, and the first to have evolved an architecture from the context of LA, rather than importing it from somewhere else. With its seemingly random collisions of shapes, and odd juxtapositions, Gehry's architecture accepts its context. When you are surrounded by freeways, giant advertising signs, and drive-in restaurants in the shape of giant bowler hats, or hot dogs, there is not much point trying to build chaste, well-mannered European style buildings. But if Gehry was uncrowned architect laureate of Los Angeles, it clearly rankled that he didn't get the prize commissions. Isozaki designed MoCA, the Getty went to Richard Meier. Gehry was beaten in the competition to design a cathedral for Los Angeles by Rafael Moneo. And when Gehry finally did get a plum project in his home town - the Disney concert hall - construction stopped almost as soon as the foundations had been dug, when the trustees ran out of money. It has only recently got back on track. Bilbao catapulted Gehry into another phase of his career, beyond the limits of Los Angeles. It was a sensation because it looked nothing like an art gallery, or for that matter, nothing like a piece of architecture at all. With its puckered titanium skinned roof, the Guggenheim was more like a train crash than a building, a home-made mutant version of the Sydney Opera House.

      "byline": "By Harriet Lane",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Zac Goldsmith is a little late getting to the Ecologist' s offices, a utility shell in the lee of the Chelsea power station, so I take a seat on a sofa of ancient, Sloaney provenance: a sofa that, it occurs, might just be a cast-off from the family home, Ormeley Lodge, and might thus have received the imprint of some very influential bottoms indeed. Around me, the Ecologist 's tiny editorial team (two, this morning) are sitting tapping away at keyboards by the acid light of long-life bulbs. Staff are clearly more preoccupied with saving the planet than doing the cleaning: surfaces are covered with grime and unwashed cups, and the loo is very, ahem, ecological indeed. And there, chucked on the floor next to the bog roll, is some reading matter: a copy of Private Eye, the magazine with which Zac's papa, the late Sir James Goldsmith, had such a nasty dust-up. </p> <p>Zac, as editor of the Ecologist for the last three years, is also enthusiastic about litigation. He itches to be sued. The targets on which the magazine has slapped its cross hairs - such as Monsanto, Wal-Mart and most recently the big cancer charities - are, he claims, forever threatening him with legal action and, 'I always write back, because I know what we're saying is accurate, saying, \"We'd be happy to lend you financial assistance if you want to pursue this line in the courts.\" In other words, we'd love you to sue us. Anytime.' So far, to his disappointment, no one has bitten. 'This is not a hobby magazine, it's not passive or objective. It's a campaign tool.' </p> <p>He believes that his father, who died in 1997, was unwise to tackle Private Eye. 'Probably that was a rash thing to do... he certainly gave it a lot more prominence. But from what I know, and I quite enjoy Private Eye, they really did go for him, and it went on and on. So I'm not sure I blame him. I'm not sure how well I'd bear up under that. Actually, come to think of it, unless it was totally dishonest, I wouldn't really care.' </p> <p>Zac, who gave up smoking cigarettes six months ago when his daughter Uma was born, produces a battered-looking cigar butt, while his labrador-cross Tashi, obtained from Battersea Dogs' Home, settles in the corner, gazing at him with all the starry-eyed devotion of a hound on a medieval knight's tomb. The cigar is jammed, unlit, in the corner of his mouth: it's a difficult look, unless you hail from Little Italy or Wall Street, but he pulls it off. Of course he pulls it off. Zac may only be 25, but he has as much aplomb as cash. And he has shedloads of cash. Somewhere between \u00a310 million and \u00a3100m, or so I've read. 'The prime purpose of money for me personally is to enable me to do what I'm doing now,' says Zac, who says these estimates are either 'conservative' or 'wildly over the top'. 'If I didn't have any money, I'd be working in order to do this - and I'd want as much as possible.' </p> <p>The Ecologist was founded 30 years ago by his uncle, Edward Goldsmith. To help it though a recent relaunch, Zac sank a stack of his own money into it, and has never drawn a salary. 'Next year I hope it will even out a bit. Possibly go into the black,' he says, giving the impression that he doesn't care too much either way. This is not the approach of his father, the controversial corporate buccaneer who left an estimated fortune of \u00a31.5 billion (and eight children by various wives and mistresses) when he died of pancreatic cancer in 1997. Zac, whose mother is Lady Annabel Goldsmith and whose older sister Jemima is married to Imran Khan, may have the second generation's financial insouciance, but he does have his father's drive, irreverence and unpre dictability. In his inky cords and old cashmere jersey, with tousled hair and angular good looks, he may be living the boho trustafarian dream - but he is, without question, putting his money where his mouth is. </p> <p>There were rumbles of dissatisfaction from the green lobby when his uncle appointed him editor. It was certainly a stunning career trajectory. After being expelled from Eton at 17 for smoking dope, and picking up A-levels at a Cambridge crammer, Zac went on an extended year off (travelling in the Himalayas and California, where he worked on a river project). He had only recently returned to the UK when, following an enormous row, most of the Ecologist 's editorial team stormed out. 'A cynic would probably say that I'd knocked everyone off in the course of a week, removed all obstacles and created the Ecologist empire,' he says, drily. 'That's not the way it happened, though. </p> <p>'The point about nepotism: sure, if I wasn't Teddy's nephew, it wouldn't have ended up in my lap, but all that does is ensure I put my arse into it. If I discovered tomorrow that I was doing a bad job, I'd leave - simple as that. It's not an ego trip because I know my life is devoted to these issues. How I choose to stay involved is up for grabs. In 10 years' time, I might be an eco terrorist. But I'll take the most effective path, whatever that is.' </p> <p>The editorial tone of the magazine has become excitingly pyrotechnic under his stewardship. Zac - who loathes Blair ('Wouldn't trust him with my dog. Wouldn't trust him with my budgerigar') and Hague ('I'd have to drug myself before I voted for him. Get drunk beforehand. And then wash myself afterwards') equally - is keen to spice things up a bit. He expresses satisfaction that there are two anti-Ecologist websites up at the moment, one accusing it of being Stalinist, the other Hitlerite. 'To me, that's a huge compliment.' </p> <p>Politically, his father is still a major influence, and not just because Zac is also ardently opposed to the single currency. Sir James, who underwent an ecological conversion towards the end of his life, may have started off as a fervent free-marketeer, but 'as he grew older he began to realise that there were so many subsidies that the free market was artificially slanted in favour of big business - it wasn't a free market at all.' In Zac's opinion, 'if there's one solution to the mess we're all in, it's buying local, producing for local consumption, and reducing the distance between producer and consumer. That cuts out so many of the environmental problems.' So he is a passionate supporter of small rural communities. Recently, that prompted him to stick a pro-hunting piece in the magazine. 'A lot of people cancelled their subscriptions. But my interest is in attracting readers who are willing to debate these things, otherwise we'll all grow fat and lazy. If that message is unsaleable, then so be it.' </p> <p>That's the money talking. But then, there is something unworldly about Zac, a strange foil to his magnificent apocalyptic zeal ('The world is so ugly now, so mutilated. I get very gloomy thinking about what I've brought my daughter into'). I've read that he traces his interest in the environment back to the age of nine when he converted a chicken run in the garden into a large and luxurious budgie sanctuary. </p> <p>'That story,' says Zac, puzzled. 'There is truth to that, but I'm just amazed that such a flippant story is reprinted every time the Ecologist is mentioned.' </p> <p>Oh, come off it. As a journalist himself, he has to see the comic potential of the words 'budgie' and 'sanctuary'. </p> <p>'I suppose so,' he says uncertainly. 'Actually, sanctuary's a very grand word for it. It was like an old-age people's home for budgerigars.' The staff at the petshop told him he couldn't keep hard-beaked and soft-billed birds together because they'd kill each other: 'There were all these rules and regulations and it seemed ridiculous. So I thought if it was big enough and as wild as possible, with nettles and bushes and a pear tree, then they'd all get on. And it is pretty harmonious.' </p> <p>Like his father, Zac has always viewed rules with a lordly contempt. He and his wife Sheherazade, the daughter of an asset-stripper and the socialite/PR Viviane Ventura who once wrote her own Guide to Social Climbing , were married last year. (At the Ritz reception, everything was organic, including the wedding cake and the vodka.) They have since bought a farm near Tavistock, and hope to be self-sufficient within five years. It may sound fairly Petit Hameau, but Zac takes it very seriously. 'If the magazine collapsed, if the world was going to self-destruct, I would just sink my hands into the mud and live like a pig. Not in a negative sense,' he adds quickly. 'I mean, I love pigs.' Last week he bought himself a Gloucester Old Spot. He's keen to get involved in the Devon farming scene, though he knows that he'll be an outsider until he's 80. His uncle lived in Cornwall for 20 years, 'and he was always that eccentric Jew on the hill'. </p> <p>Sheherazade is about to launch an organic deli in Battersea, but Zac says the produce grown on the Devon farm will not be suitable, partly because she wants to use local suppliers, and partly because he plans to flout the EU agricultural regulations wherever possible. 'If I want to move one of my sheep from my field to a neighbour's, I have to make a formal report to MAFF and send them the passport of this individual sheep. These rules are mad. They're designed to kill the small producers.' </p> <p>Mr and Mrs Goldsmith take the train to Devon, although (Zac points out) they travel from Exeter to the farm by car because there is no local bus. He and his wife do their best to pop Uma into flannel nappies, but these are proving a bit of a nightmare. In other words, it's a struggle to be green, no matter how many millions you have. </p> <p>The ecological movement, he says, is very good at making people feel guilty, 'and I don't think that's fair. I can choose to walk to work, where to buy my food. I'm in a very lucky position. Ninety-nine per cent of people can't choose - they're just lucky to get a bloody job. And if their local shop has been out-competed, then they have to get into their car and drive to the out-of-town supermarket. Before we start pointing our fingers, we have to encourage policy-makers to create an infrastructure which can accommodate an ecological lifestyle.' He sticks the butt back in his mouth and chomps on it: Sir James's son, but someone else as well.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Zac Goldsmith is a little late getting to the Ecologist' s offices, a utility shell in the lee of the Chelsea power station, so I take a seat on a sofa of ancient, Sloaney provenance: a sofa that, it occurs, might just be a cast-off from the family home, Ormeley Lodge, and might thus have received the imprint of some very influential bottoms indeed. Around me, the Ecologist 's tiny editorial team (two, this morning) are sitting tapping away at keyboards by the acid light of long-life bulbs. Staff are clearly more preoccupied with saving the planet than doing the cleaning: surfaces are covered with grime and unwashed cups, and the loo is very, ahem, ecological indeed. And there, chucked on the floor next to the bog roll, is some reading matter: a copy of Private Eye, the magazine with which Zac's papa, the late Sir James Goldsmith, had such a nasty dust-up. Zac, as editor of the Ecologist for the last three years, is also enthusiastic about litigation. He itches to be sued. The targets on which the magazine has slapped its cross hairs - such as Monsanto, Wal-Mart and most recently the big cancer charities - are, he claims, forever threatening him with legal action and, 'I always write back, because I know what we're saying is accurate, saying, \"We'd be happy to lend you financial assistance if you want to pursue this line in the courts.\" In other words, we'd love you to sue us. Anytime.' So far, to his disappointment, no one has bitten. 'This is not a hobby magazine, it's not passive or objective. It's a campaign tool.' He believes that his father, who died in 1997, was unwise to tackle Private Eye. 'Probably that was a rash thing to do... he certainly gave it a lot more prominence. But from what I know, and I quite enjoy Private Eye, they really did go for him, and it went on and on. So I'm not sure I blame him. I'm not sure how well I'd bear up under that. Actually, come to think of it, unless it was totally dishonest, I wouldn't really care.' Zac, who gave up smoking cigarettes six months ago when his daughter Uma was born, produces a battered-looking cigar butt, while his labrador-cross Tashi, obtained from Battersea Dogs' Home, settles in the corner, gazing at him with all the starry-eyed devotion of a hound on a medieval knight's tomb. The cigar is jammed, unlit, in the corner of his mouth: it's a difficult look, unless you hail from Little Italy or Wall Street, but he pulls it off. Of course he pulls it off. Zac may only be 25, but he has as much aplomb as cash. And he has shedloads of cash. Somewhere between \u00a310 million and \u00a3100m, or so I've read. 'The prime purpose of money for me personally is to enable me to do what I'm doing now,' says Zac, who says these estimates are either 'conservative' or 'wildly over the top'. 'If I didn't have any money, I'd be working in order to do this - and I'd want as much as possible.' The Ecologist was founded 30 years ago by his uncle, Edward Goldsmith. To help it though a recent relaunch, Zac sank a stack of his own money into it, and has never drawn a salary. 'Next year I hope it will even out a bit. Possibly go into the black,' he says, giving the impression that he doesn't care too much either way. This is not the approach of his father, the controversial corporate buccaneer who left an estimated fortune of \u00a31.5 billion (and eight children by various wives and mistresses) when he died of pancreatic cancer in 1997. Zac, whose mother is Lady Annabel Goldsmith and whose older sister Jemima is married to Imran Khan, may have the second generation's financial insouciance, but he does have his father's drive, irreverence and unpre dictability. In his inky cords and old cashmere jersey, with tousled hair and angular good looks, he may be living the boho trustafarian dream - but he is, without question, putting his money where his mouth is. There were rumbles of dissatisfaction from the green lobby when his uncle appointed him editor. It was certainly a stunning career trajectory. After being expelled from Eton at 17 for smoking dope, and picking up A-levels at a Cambridge crammer, Zac went on an extended year off (travelling in the Himalayas and California, where he worked on a river project). He had only recently returned to the UK when, following an enormous row, most of the Ecologist 's editorial team stormed out. 'A cynic would probably say that I'd knocked everyone off in the course of a week, removed all obstacles and created the Ecologist empire,' he says, drily. 'That's not the way it happened, though. 'The point about nepotism: sure, if I wasn't Teddy's nephew, it wouldn't have ended up in my lap, but all that does is ensure I put my arse into it. If I discovered tomorrow that I was doing a bad job, I'd leave - simple as that. It's not an ego trip because I know my life is devoted to these issues. How I choose to stay involved is up for grabs. In 10 years' time, I might be an eco terrorist. But I'll take the most effective path, whatever that is.' The editorial tone of the magazine has become excitingly pyrotechnic under his stewardship. Zac - who loathes Blair ('Wouldn't trust him with my dog. Wouldn't trust him with my budgerigar') and Hague ('I'd have to drug myself before I voted for him. Get drunk beforehand. And then wash myself afterwards') equally - is keen to spice things up a bit. He expresses satisfaction that there are two anti-Ecologist websites up at the moment, one accusing it of being Stalinist, the other Hitlerite. 'To me, that's a huge compliment.' Politically, his father is still a major influence, and not just because Zac is also ardently opposed to the single currency. Sir James, who underwent an ecological conversion towards the end of his life, may have started off as a fervent free-marketeer, but 'as he grew older he began to realise that there were so many subsidies that the free market was artificially slanted in favour of big business - it wasn't a free market at all.' In Zac's opinion, 'if there's one solution to the mess we're all in, it's buying local, producing for local consumption, and reducing the distance between producer and consumer. That cuts out so many of the environmental problems.' So he is a passionate supporter of small rural communities. Recently, that prompted him to stick a pro-hunting piece in the magazine. 'A lot of people cancelled their subscriptions. But my interest is in attracting readers who are willing to debate these things, otherwise we'll all grow fat and lazy. If that message is unsaleable, then so be it.' That's the money talking. But then, there is something unworldly about Zac, a strange foil to his magnificent apocalyptic zeal ('The world is so ugly now, so mutilated. I get very gloomy thinking about what I've brought my daughter into'). I've read that he traces his interest in the environment back to the age of nine when he converted a chicken run in the garden into a large and luxurious budgie sanctuary. 'That story,' says Zac, puzzled. 'There is truth to that, but I'm just amazed that such a flippant story is reprinted every time the Ecologist is mentioned.' Oh, come off it. As a journalist himself, he has to see the comic potential of the words 'budgie' and 'sanctuary'. 'I suppose so,' he says uncertainly. 'Actually, sanctuary's a very grand word for it. It was like an old-age people's home for budgerigars.' The staff at the petshop told him he couldn't keep hard-beaked and soft-billed birds together because they'd kill each other: 'There were all these rules and regulations and it seemed ridiculous. So I thought if it was big enough and as wild as possible, with nettles and bushes and a pear tree, then they'd all get on. And it is pretty harmonious.' Like his father, Zac has always viewed rules with a lordly contempt. He and his wife Sheherazade, the daughter of an asset-stripper and the socialite/PR Viviane Ventura who once wrote her own Guide to Social Climbing , were married last year. (At the Ritz reception, everything was organic, including the wedding cake and the vodka.) They have since bought a farm near Tavistock, and hope to be self-sufficient within five years. It may sound fairly Petit Hameau, but Zac takes it very seriously. 'If the magazine collapsed, if the world was going to self-destruct, I would just sink my hands into the mud and live like a pig. Not in a negative sense,' he adds quickly. 'I mean, I love pigs.' Last week he bought himself a Gloucester Old Spot. He's keen to get involved in the Devon farming scene, though he knows that he'll be an outsider until he's 80. His uncle lived in Cornwall for 20 years, 'and he was always that eccentric Jew on the hill'. Sheherazade is about to launch an organic deli in Battersea, but Zac says the produce grown on the Devon farm will not be suitable, partly because she wants to use local suppliers, and partly because he plans to flout the EU agricultural regulations wherever possible. 'If I want to move one of my sheep from my field to a neighbour's, I have to make a formal report to MAFF and send them the passport of this individual sheep. These rules are mad. They're designed to kill the small producers.' Mr and Mrs Goldsmith take the train to Devon, although (Zac points out) they travel from Exeter to the farm by car because there is no local bus. He and his wife do their best to pop Uma into flannel nappies, but these are proving a bit of a nightmare. In other words, it's a struggle to be green, no matter how many millions you have. The ecological movement, he says, is very good at making people feel guilty, 'and I don't think that's fair. I can choose to walk to work, where to buy my food. I'm in a very lucky position. Ninety-nine per cent of people can't choose - they're just lucky to get a bloody job. And if their local shop has been out-competed, then they have to get into their car and drive to the out-of-town supermarket. Before we start pointing our fingers, we have to encourage policy-makers to create an infrastructure which can accommodate an ecological lifestyle.' He sticks the butt back in his mouth and chomps on it: Sir James's son, but someone else as well.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Among the productions not currently in the repertoire at the Royal National Theatre is a staging of Trial By Jury , although Trevor Nunn might want to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera posthaste in the light of the trial by media he has endured in recent weeks. In some cases, the charges are justified: where are the fresh new writers and directors? Since Nunn took over from Richard Eyre in 1997, audiences have yet to encounter the directorial coup de foudre experienced in 1992 when Stephen Daldry, then relatively unknown and scarcely in his thirties, blew the lid off An Inspector Calls. Or two years later, when Sean Mathias gave full expressionist vent to Jean Cocteau's Les Parents Terribles. The finest productions of the Nunn regime have tended to be directed by Nunn. The argument about his directorial skill is not in doubt; it is his qualities as producer which are at issue.</p> <p>On the new play front, too, Eyre was fortunate in having a productive and protracted relationship with David Hare that led to five National collaborations starting with Racing Demon, a play on anyone's shortlist of the twentieth century's best. Lacking such a partnership, Nunn has had to play talent scout amid an increasingly competitive theatrical climate - a time when, for instance, Hare can (and indeed did ) plump for the Royal Court or the Donmar or the Almeida over the National, just as Alan Bennett, whose The Madness of George III was a highlight of Eyre's tenure, chose the West End to premiere his The Lady In the Van last winter.</p> <p>In a good year, the Royal Court on its own can stage close to 20 new plays, the same number of productions overall (ie new works and revivals) that the National will have opened by the end of this year. Multiply that by the number of venues here and abroad clamouring for the finest new writing, and the National becomes simply one viable home among many for a dramatist with a stageworthy script. As Eyre remarked last month in a Platform Performance on the Olivier stage of his former home, there are not loads of great plays out there failing to get produced.</p> <p>If demand is outstripping supply, then disasters can happen: Stephen Poliakoff's Remember This, a Nunn-era turkey pulled early to make way for the return of the Eyre-era success, Patrick Marber's Closer. (Some performances of the Poliakoff play were playing to low double-digit attendance in the 898-seat Lyttelton auditorium.) Or Hanif Kureishi's Sleep With Me whose title was far more entertaining than its sour, self-righteous content. That one, however, did fine, playing to 86 per cent capacity during a 1999-2000 season in which box-office percentages across all three theatres averaged out at a decent 72 per cent. (The National report on the past season is expected to be published later this week, among its findings a none-too-shocking accumulated deficit of \u00a3164,000.)</p> <p>Any new writing policy, of course, has its ups and downs. (Anyone remember Paul Godfrey's The Blue Ball from 1995? Didn't think so.) But it's not for nothing that Frank Rich in the New York Times once called Eyre 'the most successful producer, not to mention the most versatile, in the English-speaking theatre'. It took guts to programme an overtly political, seven-hour American play about Aids, as Eyre did with Angels In America .</p> <p>Still, running a theatre - any theatre - always demands a mixture of expediency, experience and luck, so Nunn's fiercest critics might want to think twice before hysterically demanding that he be ousted. After all, who is there to replace him? In 1996, the smart money to succeed Eyre lay on Sam Mendes and Stephen Daldry, with Nunn's accession to the post in 1997 seen as an intelligent five-year interregnum that would permit either of his junior colleagues to slide gently into the hot seat in 2002.</p> <p>Well, as American Beauty advised, look closer. Mendes has the ideal home at the Donmar Warehouse for someone with such an itinerant career. He can direct To the Green Fields Beyond on home base and then segue to America to direct Tom Hanks in The Road To Perdition for DreamWorks, as he will do next year. Programming a Donmar season can be done long-distance whereas the day-to-day management of a building with a \u00a330 million a year turnover cannot.</p> <p>It's for exactly that reason that Nunn's contract requires him to be in situ to the extent that it does (and why, to date, he hasn't been able to spare the 12 weeks necessary to remount for Broadway his exhilarating revival of Oklahoma!); the board did not want a repeat of the charges of absenteeism that beset Peter Hall during his pre-Eyre tenure, and even Nunn in the waning period of his 18-year RSC stewardship. The difference is that Nunn at that time had a co-artistic director in Terry Hands, whereas now he is steering - whether by choice or by default - the tanker that is the National alone.</p> <p>And what of Daldry? Difficult to say at the moment, especially with Billy Elliot opening this weekend in America. The film is the first American offering from Universal Focus, the new arthouse division of Universal Pictures, which expects to make a noise on its maiden outing to be heard all the way to the Oscars.</p> <p>But even if Billy Elliot doesn't bring home the same cache of trophies as Mendes's American Beauty , the impact of its deserved success is clear: whereas a decade ago, you could talk about training up theatre directors to take on a job like the National, these days a burgeoning theatre practitioner's sights are just as often set on Hollywood. And why not? A British stage director's gifts are in short supply on the West Coast: at least they can talk to actors, whereas too many American filmmakers converse principally with special effects.</p> <p>So if Mendes and Daldry are out of the running to take over at the National, who does that leave? The West Yorkshire Playhouse's Jude Kelly is the perennially-trumpeted regional prospect: and while she is a talented director-administrator, she does not seem quite in the same league. (Her transfer from Leeds to the National of Singin' In the Rain, returning for a second engagement at Christmas, must constitute a mixed blessing vis-\u00e0-vis any eventual job there; after all, a stage version of a jolly Hollywood film isn't the same as reclaiming for keeps Oklahoma! or Carousel.) Looking elsewhere, one can only lament the apparent desire to sustain successful freelance careers that is keeping the likes of David Leveaux (director of the Donmar's acclaimed Electra starring Zo\u00eb Wanamaker and The Real Thing with Jennifer Ehle) and Matthew Warchus (the original director of Art) out of the frame - not to mention the fact that neither has ever shown any desire to run a building. (In any case, Leveaux, one of three associate directors at the Donmar, has extant and time-consuming ties in Japan to Theatre Project, Tokyo.) In demand as much on Broadway as here - Warchus's spring staging of Stephen Sondheim's Follies is the New York season's most eagerly awaited opening - those two men are also busy fashioning film careers. But before Leveaux gets to his long-planned film of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin , which has been talked about for Kate Winslet, he is in New York directing Juliette Binoche's American theatre debut in Pinter's Betrayal .</p> <p>Britain has many other fine directors, among them Michael Grandage, who increasingly seems the obvious successor to Mendes at the Donmar. But do any of these people want to be burdened by what more than ever seems less a building than a behemoth? Or by the demands of an auditorium, the Olivier, that may be Britain's most fickle? Eyre suffered his own mishaps on the same stage ( Johnny on a Spot, the Alan Howard Macbeth), so one can hardly regard as isolated instances Tim Supple's much-publicised recent travails with The Villains' Opera and Romeo and Juliet. Supple may well have been among those being groomed by Nunn for big things, much as Eyre gave an important leg-up to the likes of Daldry, Mendes, Mathias and Nicholas Hytner. After all, for several years he ran the Young Vic - and (for the most part) very well indeed. But Supple's shortcomings on the Olivier stage this year won't further his case for advancement.</p> <p>Look around at London's other theatres, and one sees signs of artistic retrenchment: Adrian Noble is presiding over an increasingly exciting RSC - an institution that not long ago was reeling from the very brickbats now reserved for the National. And while one could argue that Ian McDiarmid and Jonathan Kent have turned an ever-expansionist Almeida into a de facto National - the difference being that their productions are spread across the capital instead of mostly centred under one roof - those men are busy relocating operations to King's Cross for the period when their Islington base is being refurbished. It is scarcely the time for them to abandon ship. Perhaps the National would be best advised to do what American subsidised theatres - the Lincoln Centre, for one - often do, and the Royal Opera House, with Michael Kaiser, recently did: opt for a leading administrator who does not necessarily double as a director.</p> <p>In the end, one has to ponder the wisdom of pushing Nunn out of a job that hasn't exactly created a queue of worthy successors. (Nor is an avalanche of bad press going to encourage candidates to come forward.) Is that Nunn's fault for not inculcating a next generation, instead centralising power close to his chest? Or is it the fault of a system that has changed so irrevocably that the old rules no longer apply? The scary prospect has little to with Nunn's ongoing regime which, undoubtedly, will continue to field its highs and lows. It pertains instead to the theatrical equivalent of that time-honoured question most frequently applied to giving a party: what if you advertised one of the world's defining theatre posts, and nobody came?</p> <p><b>The contenders</b></p> <p><b> Stephen Daldry </b> Eyre-apparent Sam Mendes definitely won't be in the frame, but can Daldry be persuaded? How does running three auditoria compare to getting a stage house to crumble nightly on cue in An Inspector Calls, his sensational National calling card (his second NT production, Machinal, brought him a second successive Olivier Award) or getting Billy Elliot to dance?</p> <p><b> Jonathan Kent and Ian McDiarmid </b> This pair must feel at times as if they are running an equivalent of the National, with shows on simultaneously at the Almeida, the West End, and site-specific venues like the Gainsborough Studios. And think of the stars we'd see on the South Bank if Almeida alumni Cate Blanchett, Juliette Binoche, Liam Neeson and Kevin Spacey are any guide. Kent has navigated the National's toughest customer, directing Diana Rigg at her most fearless on the Olivier stage in Mother Courage .</p> <p><b> Matthew Warchus</b> Warchus can do contemporary plays in spaces small (the Donmar's True West which Philip Seymor Hoffman and John C. Reilly later played on Broadway), and classics in large places (the Olivier, where his Volpone, with Michael Gambon, won an Olivier for Simon Russell Beale). Friendly with Sam Shepard, Sondheim and Yasmina Reza, whose Life x 2 he directs for the National at the end of the year: think of the names in his Rolodex.</p> <p><b> Michael Kaiser </b> Well, why not? Possibly because he's forsaking the Royal Opera House and Britain to return to America to take a job at Washington's Kennedy Centre. Matt Wolf is London theatre critic for Variety</p>",

      "bodyText": "Among the productions not currently in the repertoire at the Royal National Theatre is a staging of Trial By Jury , although Trevor Nunn might want to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera posthaste in the light of the trial by media he has endured in recent weeks. In some cases, the charges are justified: where are the fresh new writers and directors? Since Nunn took over from Richard Eyre in 1997, audiences have yet to encounter the directorial coup de foudre experienced in 1992 when Stephen Daldry, then relatively unknown and scarcely in his thirties, blew the lid off An Inspector Calls. Or two years later, when Sean Mathias gave full expressionist vent to Jean Cocteau's Les Parents Terribles. The finest productions of the Nunn regime have tended to be directed by Nunn. The argument about his directorial skill is not in doubt; it is his qualities as producer which are at issue. On the new play front, too, Eyre was fortunate in having a productive and protracted relationship with David Hare that led to five National collaborations starting with Racing Demon, a play on anyone's shortlist of the twentieth century's best. Lacking such a partnership, Nunn has had to play talent scout amid an increasingly competitive theatrical climate - a time when, for instance, Hare can (and indeed did ) plump for the Royal Court or the Donmar or the Almeida over the National, just as Alan Bennett, whose The Madness of George III was a highlight of Eyre's tenure, chose the West End to premiere his The Lady In the Van last winter. In a good year, the Royal Court on its own can stage close to 20 new plays, the same number of productions overall (ie new works and revivals) that the National will have opened by the end of this year. Multiply that by the number of venues here and abroad clamouring for the finest new writing, and the National becomes simply one viable home among many for a dramatist with a stageworthy script. As Eyre remarked last month in a Platform Performance on the Olivier stage of his former home, there are not loads of great plays out there failing to get produced. If demand is outstripping supply, then disasters can happen: Stephen Poliakoff's Remember This, a Nunn-era turkey pulled early to make way for the return of the Eyre-era success, Patrick Marber's Closer. (Some performances of the Poliakoff play were playing to low double-digit attendance in the 898-seat Lyttelton auditorium.) Or Hanif Kureishi's Sleep With Me whose title was far more entertaining than its sour, self-righteous content. That one, however, did fine, playing to 86 per cent capacity during a 1999-2000 season in which box-office percentages across all three theatres averaged out at a decent 72 per cent. (The National report on the past season is expected to be published later this week, among its findings a none-too-shocking accumulated deficit of \u00a3164,000.) Any new writing policy, of course, has its ups and downs. (Anyone remember Paul Godfrey's The Blue Ball from 1995? Didn't think so.) But it's not for nothing that Frank Rich in the New York Times once called Eyre 'the most successful producer, not to mention the most versatile, in the English-speaking theatre'. It took guts to programme an overtly political, seven-hour American play about Aids, as Eyre did with Angels In America . Still, running a theatre - any theatre - always demands a mixture of expediency, experience and luck, so Nunn's fiercest critics might want to think twice before hysterically demanding that he be ousted. After all, who is there to replace him? In 1996, the smart money to succeed Eyre lay on Sam Mendes and Stephen Daldry, with Nunn's accession to the post in 1997 seen as an intelligent five-year interregnum that would permit either of his junior colleagues to slide gently into the hot seat in 2002. Well, as American Beauty advised, look closer. Mendes has the ideal home at the Donmar Warehouse for someone with such an itinerant career. He can direct To the Green Fields Beyond on home base and then segue to America to direct Tom Hanks in The Road To Perdition for DreamWorks, as he will do next year. Programming a Donmar season can be done long-distance whereas the day-to-day management of a building with a \u00a330 million a year turnover cannot. It's for exactly that reason that Nunn's contract requires him to be in situ to the extent that it does (and why, to date, he hasn't been able to spare the 12 weeks necessary to remount for Broadway his exhilarating revival of Oklahoma!); the board did not want a repeat of the charges of absenteeism that beset Peter Hall during his pre-Eyre tenure, and even Nunn in the waning period of his 18-year RSC stewardship. The difference is that Nunn at that time had a co-artistic director in Terry Hands, whereas now he is steering - whether by choice or by default - the tanker that is the National alone. And what of Daldry? Difficult to say at the moment, especially with Billy Elliot opening this weekend in America. The film is the first American offering from Universal Focus, the new arthouse division of Universal Pictures, which expects to make a noise on its maiden outing to be heard all the way to the Oscars. But even if Billy Elliot doesn't bring home the same cache of trophies as Mendes's American Beauty , the impact of its deserved success is clear: whereas a decade ago, you could talk about training up theatre directors to take on a job like the National, these days a burgeoning theatre practitioner's sights are just as often set on Hollywood. And why not? A British stage director's gifts are in short supply on the West Coast: at least they can talk to actors, whereas too many American filmmakers converse principally with special effects. So if Mendes and Daldry are out of the running to take over at the National, who does that leave? The West Yorkshire Playhouse's Jude Kelly is the perennially-trumpeted regional prospect: and while she is a talented director-administrator, she does not seem quite in the same league. (Her transfer from Leeds to the National of Singin' In the Rain, returning for a second engagement at Christmas, must constitute a mixed blessing vis-\u00e0-vis any eventual job there; after all, a stage version of a jolly Hollywood film isn't the same as reclaiming for keeps Oklahoma! or Carousel.) Looking elsewhere, one can only lament the apparent desire to sustain successful freelance careers that is keeping the likes of David Leveaux (director of the Donmar's acclaimed Electra starring Zo\u00eb Wanamaker and The Real Thing with Jennifer Ehle) and Matthew Warchus (the original director of Art) out of the frame - not to mention the fact that neither has ever shown any desire to run a building. (In any case, Leveaux, one of three associate directors at the Donmar, has extant and time-consuming ties in Japan to Theatre Project, Tokyo.) In demand as much on Broadway as here - Warchus's spring staging of Stephen Sondheim's Follies is the New York season's most eagerly awaited opening - those two men are also busy fashioning film careers. But before Leveaux gets to his long-planned film of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin , which has been talked about for Kate Winslet, he is in New York directing Juliette Binoche's American theatre debut in Pinter's Betrayal . Britain has many other fine directors, among them Michael Grandage, who increasingly seems the obvious successor to Mendes at the Donmar. But do any of these people want to be burdened by what more than ever seems less a building than a behemoth? Or by the demands of an auditorium, the Olivier, that may be Britain's most fickle? Eyre suffered his own mishaps on the same stage ( Johnny on a Spot, the Alan Howard Macbeth), so one can hardly regard as isolated instances Tim Supple's much-publicised recent travails with The Villains' Opera and Romeo and Juliet. Supple may well have been among those being groomed by Nunn for big things, much as Eyre gave an important leg-up to the likes of Daldry, Mendes, Mathias and Nicholas Hytner. After all, for several years he ran the Young Vic - and (for the most part) very well indeed. But Supple's shortcomings on the Olivier stage this year won't further his case for advancement. Look around at London's other theatres, and one sees signs of artistic retrenchment: Adrian Noble is presiding over an increasingly exciting RSC - an institution that not long ago was reeling from the very brickbats now reserved for the National. And while one could argue that Ian McDiarmid and Jonathan Kent have turned an ever-expansionist Almeida into a de facto National - the difference being that their productions are spread across the capital instead of mostly centred under one roof - those men are busy relocating operations to King's Cross for the period when their Islington base is being refurbished. It is scarcely the time for them to abandon ship. Perhaps the National would be best advised to do what American subsidised theatres - the Lincoln Centre, for one - often do, and the Royal Opera House, with Michael Kaiser, recently did: opt for a leading administrator who does not necessarily double as a director. In the end, one has to ponder the wisdom of pushing Nunn out of a job that hasn't exactly created a queue of worthy successors. (Nor is an avalanche of bad press going to encourage candidates to come forward.) Is that Nunn's fault for not inculcating a next generation, instead centralising power close to his chest? Or is it the fault of a system that has changed so irrevocably that the old rules no longer apply? The scary prospect has little to with Nunn's ongoing regime which, undoubtedly, will continue to field its highs and lows. It pertains instead to the theatrical equivalent of that time-honoured question most frequently applied to giving a party: what if you advertised one of the world's defining theatre posts, and nobody came? The contenders Stephen Daldry Eyre-apparent Sam Mendes definitely won't be in the frame, but can Daldry be persuaded? How does running three auditoria compare to getting a stage house to crumble nightly on cue in An Inspector Calls, his sensational National calling card (his second NT production, Machinal, brought him a second successive Olivier Award) or getting Billy Elliot to dance? Jonathan Kent and Ian McDiarmid This pair must feel at times as if they are running an equivalent of the National, with shows on simultaneously at the Almeida, the West End, and site-specific venues like the Gainsborough Studios. And think of the stars we'd see on the South Bank if Almeida alumni Cate Blanchett, Juliette Binoche, Liam Neeson and Kevin Spacey are any guide. Kent has navigated the National's toughest customer, directing Diana Rigg at her most fearless on the Olivier stage in Mother Courage . Matthew Warchus Warchus can do contemporary plays in spaces small (the Donmar's True West which Philip Seymor Hoffman and John C. Reilly later played on Broadway), and classics in large places (the Olivier, where his Volpone, with Michael Gambon, won an Olivier for Simon Russell Beale). Friendly with Sam Shepard, Sondheim and Yasmina Reza, whose Life x 2 he directs for the National at the end of the year: think of the names in his Rolodex. Michael Kaiser Well, why not? Possibly because he's forsaking the Royal Opera House and Britain to return to America to take a job at Washington's Kennedy Centre. Matt Wolf is London theatre critic for Variety",

      "body": "<p><strong> Telling Time</strong> National Gallery, London WC2 until 14 January 2001 </p> <p> Is time of the essence in painting? Thomas Eakins definitely thought so. 'In a big picture,' enthused the American realist, 'you can tell what o'clock it is.' Eakins was so precise with the facts, so punctilious in every detail, that scholars have been able to work out not just the time but the date in some of his pictures. The two yanks rowing the river in his Pair-Oared Shell , for example, went under the bridge at 7.20pm on 27 July 1872. If not a photo-finish, you could call it a time-tied painting. </p> <p>In one sense, Eakins's picture is extraordinary in its punctuality - although you do need to be able to read the sun's angle on the water to calculate the split-second timing. But in another sense, the picture is entirely conventional. It does what many paintings do: it freezes time, fixes a moment for posterity. Zip back three centuries to Holbein's The Ambassadors and you find an artist making far more of the moment. On the table behind those imperishable travellers is a clutter of time-telling instruments, including a polyhedral sundial. One face says it's 9.30am; the others say 10.30. The discrepancy warns that it is always later than you think, but it also makes the more striking point that time expires during the very act of painting. </p> <p> The Ambassadors is one of 50 or so pictures in <strong> Telling Time</strong> at the National Gallery, a show that is emphatically not about sundials and stopwatches so much as the fourth dimension in painting. Can time pass in a picture? Can paintings themselves determine how long we look at them? Couldn't painting - like fiction, film or music - be regarded as a temporal art, taking place over time? As this vivid and ingenious show makes clear, the answers all turn out to be affirmative. </p> <p>One way of introducing time into a static image is just by telling a story. Uccello does it in St George and the Dragon by splicing beginning, middle and end in a single frame. George arrives on his bucking charger, the tip of his lance piercing the furious dragon, which has already been roped by the princess who will eventually lead it, vanquished, back to the town it's been terrorising. The narrative runs seamlessly through the line-up, left to right, from the horse's flying tail to the royal hem progressing out of the picture. Pivoting around the dragon with its weird markings, like the targets on a Spitfire wing, the picture compresses a day of action in one spectacular still. </p> <p>But even with its fine disregard for logic, Uccello's painting is hardly the most radical work on show. The National Gallery has laid hands on an amazingly progressive panel from the twelfth century, in which the artist shows two parallel plotlines converging. He does it, quite simply, by splitting the screen - about 800 years before cinema. The assumption is exactly that shared by films and cartoons: that two events occurring in a sub-divided frame will be read as simultaneous. For further proof, scan the page from Tintin alongside. </p> <p>It's impossible not to think of other media as you walk through this show. Take Hogarth's two-frame sequence, Before and After. One: the suitor flirts with the maiden, whose apples are already slipping from her apron. Two: the couple are flushed with post-coital dismay, the fruit is bruised and abandoned. The gap between is like the coy ellipsis in a novel... or the rippling dissolve in a movie. Joachim Wtewael, not hitherto of special note, even manages before and after in one image by inserting a shadowy flashback, apparently receding in the mists of time. </p> <p>Black and white for the past, colour for the present: Wtewael was working that concept back in 1612. Time and again, these artists negotiate a sophisticated contract with the viewer - a sword raised high enough and the mind anticipates death; a train in the foreground trails the past in its wake. Rembrandt's Belshazzar's Feast is being shown as an early snapshot - Belshazzar frozen with horror as the prediction of his own death materialises in neon letters above the groaning table. The future is condensed in an instant - but time has not stopped. The continuum is there in the guest who hasn't noticed yet and the bewildered maid spilling wine on the floor. </p> <p>Time is motion: flying cloaks that act like the speed lines in cartoons, streaming flames, spokes revolving in a blur. Stubbs has them all in his Fall of Phaeton, in which Phaeton seems to be asleep at the chariot wheel while his horses hurtle towards disaster. If you haven't seen this painting before - so unlike Stubbs's iconography of rapt and dignified beasts - this will be one of the discoveries of the show. Along with Munch's hectic street, with its carriage cutting across lanes in a photo-fast blur, and Rubens's sketches of dancers whirling through the motions in strobe-effect sequence. </p> <p>Clearly, this is a theme that could run and run - time as place, infinite or suspended time, slow painting or impressionistic speed. Although this show is concise, an enthralling stroll through a single avenue of images and ideas, the National Gallery has supplied a customised map to the great world of its permanent collection. There is also an eye-tracking experiment that records the way we look at pictures over time. There you will see that some artists direct your eye around their pictures like brisk traffic police, while others encourage you to wander and dawdle. Painting, like music, has its tempo. </p> <p>Unlike music, though, it doesn't have a pre-ordained scheme: you don't have to look at a painting in any specific order. Like so many theme shows, Telling Time may be a ruse - if a brilliant ruse - for gluing our attention to certain images. But it puts equal emphasis on the way we read, assemble or thread those images like a film projector. Paintings may be still, they may exist in the moment, but we don't see them all at once. They have no beginning or end: don't go by the ticking clock.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The stakeholder pension plan, which becomes available next April, will be sold on the basis of its attractive tax benefits and low charges. But moves to charge extra fees for advice threaten to make the scheme much more expensive than originally envisaged by the Government. </p> <p>To qualify as a stakeholder, a pension scheme must have no initial fee, and annual fees are limited to 1 per cent of the fund. This is much lower than the fees charged on traditional personal pension schemes, where initial charges often eat up all contributions for the first couple of years. But pension providers and independent financial advisers have argued that the 1 per cent annual fee is simply not enough to cover the cost of providing advice on taking out a pension. </p> <p>Allied Dunbar, which announced the terms of its stakeholder scheme last week, plans to charge \u00a32.75 a month (on top of the 1 per cent annual charge) throughout the life of a pension contract to cover the cost of advice from one of its 5,000 tied sales advisers. As this fee can be increased in line with inflation, it will amount to more than \u00a3825 for a 25-year contract. Kevin Ronaldson, marketing director for Allied Dunbar, justifies the charge, claiming that the fact-finding session to glean the information needed to make suitable recommendations about your finances and subsequent paperwork will take the adviser six to seven hours to complete. This does not include ongoing advice about your pension as your circumstances change. </p> <p>Allied Dunbar is the first to announce such plans, but others will no doubt follow suit. Worse still, many independent financial advisers are saying that they will not be advising individuals on stakeholder pensions. They are deterred by the lower amounts of commission for selling a stakeholder pension, typically about one-third of the amount they have been paid for selling traditional personal pensions (an adviser would typically receive \u00a3800-\u00a31,100 up-front for recommending a \u00a3100-a-month personal pension scheme, and after the first 27 months, renewal commission of about \u00a330 for every year that the policy remained in place). One adviser says: 'Where you are advising an individual on a one-off basis, it's not economically viable.' </p> <p>Many insurers and advisers are working on internet and telephone-based sales systems that provide information rather than advice, and the Financial Services Authority, the insurance industry watchdog, is drawing up 'decision trees' to help people work out whether they would benefit from investing in one. But financial experts believe both sources of information will be inadequate for people who have not invested in a pension before or who lack confidence in making financial decisions. </p> <p>So where can you go for reasonably priced advice? Tony Filbin, director of pensions development at Legal &amp; General, believes many independent financial advisers will be able to advise on stakeholders on a 'limited fact-find' basis. This means that the adviser will restrict his questions to the topic you are interested in - the stakeholder pension - rather than covering all other aspects of your finances as well. </p> <p>Bath independent financial adviser Chartwell already offers a limited fact-find service called Focused Advice. The firm charges \u00a3350 for advising on pensions, and all commission earned is rebated to the client. Chartwell director Patrick Connolly says the charge may be reduced when stakeholder is introduced, to reflect the smaller amount of commission that can be rebated. </p> <p>Some advisers may even be content with the commission that's on offer. Standard Life has developed three ways for commission to be calculated and paid to advisers, enabling them to choose. The first is level commission, a regular payment worth 3.5 per cent of every premium that is paid by the customer. The second is fund-based commission, an annual payment worth about 0.3 per cent of the fund. Both pay small but regular amounts throughout the life of the policy. Advisers who are used to larger amounts of initial commission will probably prefer accelerated fund commission. Here Standard Life calculates what size your pension fund will be 10 years ahead (based on premium size, assuming premium growth of 4 per cent and investment growth of 7 per cent) and then pays an up-front lump sum worth five times the commission that would be payable at that point. No further commission is paid until the eleventh year, when normal fund-based commission payments resume. </p> <p>Regardless of which commission style an adviser chooses, the customer will still only have to pay a maximum of 1 per cent a year, but the choice can make a big difference to the adviser. An adviser setting up a \u00a3100-a- month pension scheme would earn \u00a3614 in fund-based commission in the first 15 years (including a \u00a3260 lump sum under accelerated commission), or \u00a3840 through level commission. </p> <p>Nick Bamford of Cranleigh independent financial adviser Informed Choice, says this will be more than enough to cover his normal charges. 'We charge \u00a3110 an hour. I've just arranged a stakeholder-friendly personal pension for a lady who is contributing \u00a3200 a month, and we're being paid \u00a3533 in commission. That's about four hours' work on our fees basis, and it certainly hasn't taken four hours to arrange.' </p> <p>In fact Bamford says it will take about two hours to conduct a limited fact-find, think about recommendations, print off illustrations of how much the recommended company's contract will cost, create a file for the new client and write relevant letters. </p> <p>He says: 'We won't be charging hourly fees for advising on stakeholder unless the client requests us to rebate the commission and charge a fee instead.' </p> <p><strong>More information</strong></p> <p>Chartwell - 01225 321700</p> <p>Informed Choice - 01483 274566</p>",

      "bodyText": "The stakeholder pension plan, which becomes available next April, will be sold on the basis of its attractive tax benefits and low charges. But moves to charge extra fees for advice threaten to make the scheme much more expensive than originally envisaged by the Government. To qualify as a stakeholder, a pension scheme must have no initial fee, and annual fees are limited to 1 per cent of the fund. This is much lower than the fees charged on traditional personal pension schemes, where initial charges often eat up all contributions for the first couple of years. But pension providers and independent financial advisers have argued that the 1 per cent annual fee is simply not enough to cover the cost of providing advice on taking out a pension. Allied Dunbar, which announced the terms of its stakeholder scheme last week, plans to charge \u00a32.75 a month (on top of the 1 per cent annual charge) throughout the life of a pension contract to cover the cost of advice from one of its 5,000 tied sales advisers. As this fee can be increased in line with inflation, it will amount to more than \u00a3825 for a 25-year contract. Kevin Ronaldson, marketing director for Allied Dunbar, justifies the charge, claiming that the fact-finding session to glean the information needed to make suitable recommendations about your finances and subsequent paperwork will take the adviser six to seven hours to complete. This does not include ongoing advice about your pension as your circumstances change. Allied Dunbar is the first to announce such plans, but others will no doubt follow suit. Worse still, many independent financial advisers are saying that they will not be advising individuals on stakeholder pensions. They are deterred by the lower amounts of commission for selling a stakeholder pension, typically about one-third of the amount they have been paid for selling traditional personal pensions (an adviser would typically receive \u00a3800-\u00a31,100 up-front for recommending a \u00a3100-a-month personal pension scheme, and after the first 27 months, renewal commission of about \u00a330 for every year that the policy remained in place). One adviser says: 'Where you are advising an individual on a one-off basis, it's not economically viable.' Many insurers and advisers are working on internet and telephone-based sales systems that provide information rather than advice, and the Financial Services Authority, the insurance industry watchdog, is drawing up 'decision trees' to help people work out whether they would benefit from investing in one. But financial experts believe both sources of information will be inadequate for people who have not invested in a pension before or who lack confidence in making financial decisions. So where can you go for reasonably priced advice? Tony Filbin, director of pensions development at Legal &amp; General, believes many independent financial advisers will be able to advise on stakeholders on a 'limited fact-find' basis. This means that the adviser will restrict his questions to the topic you are interested in - the stakeholder pension - rather than covering all other aspects of your finances as well. Bath independent financial adviser Chartwell already offers a limited fact-find service called Focused Advice. The firm charges \u00a3350 for advising on pensions, and all commission earned is rebated to the client. Chartwell director Patrick Connolly says the charge may be reduced when stakeholder is introduced, to reflect the smaller amount of commission that can be rebated. Some advisers may even be content with the commission that's on offer. Standard Life has developed three ways for commission to be calculated and paid to advisers, enabling them to choose. The first is level commission, a regular payment worth 3.5 per cent of every premium that is paid by the customer. The second is fund-based commission, an annual payment worth about 0.3 per cent of the fund. Both pay small but regular amounts throughout the life of the policy. Advisers who are used to larger amounts of initial commission will probably prefer accelerated fund commission. Here Standard Life calculates what size your pension fund will be 10 years ahead (based on premium size, assuming premium growth of 4 per cent and investment growth of 7 per cent) and then pays an up-front lump sum worth five times the commission that would be payable at that point. No further commission is paid until the eleventh year, when normal fund-based commission payments resume. Regardless of which commission style an adviser chooses, the customer will still only have to pay a maximum of 1 per cent a year, but the choice can make a big difference to the adviser. An adviser setting up a \u00a3100-a- month pension scheme would earn \u00a3614 in fund-based commission in the first 15 years (including a \u00a3260 lump sum under accelerated commission), or \u00a3840 through level commission. Nick Bamford of Cranleigh independent financial adviser Informed Choice, says this will be more than enough to cover his normal charges. 'We charge \u00a3110 an hour. I've just arranged a stakeholder-friendly personal pension for a lady who is contributing \u00a3200 a month, and we're being paid \u00a3533 in commission. That's about four hours' work on our fees basis, and it certainly hasn't taken four hours to arrange.' In fact Bamford says it will take about two hours to conduct a limited fact-find, think about recommendations, print off illustrations of how much the recommended company's contract will cost, create a file for the new client and write relevant letters. He says: 'We won't be charging hourly fees for advising on stakeholder unless the client requests us to rebate the commission and charge a fee instead.'

I reported the incident to the tour manager at the airport and wrote to the insurance company. I replaced the suitcase in Salzburg during my holiday. My insurance company, Direct Travel Insurance, refused to reimburse me because I did not have an airline report and the damaged suitcase was left in Austria. I pointed out that I considered the tour manager's report adequate and stressed that manoeuvring two wheeled suitcases across London alone via the Underground was not even an option. The claim is minimal, \u00a325. BL, Hartlepool Direct Travel Insurance says claims for luggage damaged while with an airline must have a property irregularity report from that airline. This is onerous because, even if you had realised that the tour manager's word was unacceptable, airline staff are not always available at every airport at all times of the day. The insurer has now taken a second look at your claim and admits that the person rejecting it was'over-zealous' in sticking to the letter of the contract. It has sent you a cheque for \u00a325. Widows windfall failed to drop In April 1999, I bought a Scottish Widows endowment policy from an existing policyholder. I have received various letters from Scottish Widows since: each time the letters were sent to my address but with the original policyholder's name. All letters about the merger with Lloyds TSB were wrongly named, and in August I received a windfall cheque made out to the original policy owner. I returned it and am awaiting a response. CJ, Bickley Scottish Widows is in a grand muddle here. The original policyholder was regarded as the member and so was entitled to vote on the merger, but you were the qualifying member who was entitled to compensation. The insurer says 1,749 second-hand policies have been affected, with the original owners unable to vote and the new owners awaiting cheques. It confirms that it will send you another cheque in your name. Its database is currently frozen but it hopes to post your money at about the end of October. You will receive interest for the time you have waited. Synagogue hit by anti-crime rules Every two years, we change the signatories on the cheque and savings accounts for our synagogue, where I am treasurer. Each time we do this, the paperwork becomes more troublesome. NatWest requires the signa tories to visit a branch to have two forms of identification certified by the manager. Such a visit can be done only if our members do not work full- time or are willing to go to a bank on a Saturday. This is not reasonable for a synagogue whose membership is of working age. Triodos, our savings bank, requires four pieces of identification to be sent. In London, with a mobile population, low car ownership and high number of tenants, this can be a challenge. Is this level of checking really necessary for small, voluntary organisations like ourselves and do the regulations work? JB, London Both banks insist they do require this degree of identification to comply with money-laundering regulations. NatWest says the new signatories can visit any branch, from where the signatures are passed to the synagogue's home branch. Triodos, a postal bank with no branches, says it will accept a range of documents, but you still need four, even if one proves both identity and address. It might be able to make suggestions if you telephoned. The National Criminal Intelligence Service has no statistics to show whether the rules work - but suspicious transactions reported by financial institutions rose slightly last year, to 14,500. Annuities are so confusing Can you explain the difference between a pension annuity and a purchased life annuity? The annuities table in Cash show these two types provide different returns for identical purchase prices. Why? PB, Perth A pension annuity, or compulsory purchase annuity, is the one you are forced to buy with the money saved through pension contribu tions while you worked. As you had tax relief on the contributions, all the income paid from a pension annuity is taxable. You can buy a purchased life annuity with any lump sum you have available at any time. Because there was no tax relief on the lump sum, part of the income from a purchased life annuity is treated as a return of your capital, and only the balance is taxable. The older you are, the more you get from an annuity and the quotes in the Cash table (page 12) are for people of different ages and on a different basis. The first pension annuity is for a man aged 60 receiving payments in advance, while the purchased life annuity is for a man of 70 paid in arrears. There could be a slight difference in quotations even on an identical basis, with marginally worse rates for a purchased life annuity because statistics show that people buying these tend to live longer than those buying pension annuities. Writeback S.H. of Sunbury-on-Thames reveals a double hit to pensioners on a low income: 'I am to retire this month. Apart from an incomplete state pension, my income will be a small annuity which I am obliged to buy with the proceeds of my employer's pension scheme. I have just discovered that this annuity will be paid to me monthly minus basic-rate tax, leaving me to claim a rebate from the Inland Revenue at the end of every year. Some of the poorest people in the country have no choice but to give the Revenue a continuing free loan, which it is then up to them to take the initiative to recover. 'It is bad enough having to hand over a large sum of money to an insurance company for an annuity which is not much greater than could be earned on deposit. I wonder how many people know about this?' \u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. Include a telephone number.

Ministers say they will not allow providers to levy charges other than an annual management fee of no more than 1 per cent. </p> <p>'Stakeholders may be less expensive than in-house AVCs,' she says. 'The Government's charges cap has already been bettered: providers intend to offer products at between 0.4 and 0.6 per cent a year.' </p> <p>Either way, it is likely that from April, a personal or stakeholder pension will be the best way to top up pension savings if you are an occupational scheme member with this option. </p> <p>The Association of British Insurers is lobbying to change the rules on AVCs and FSAVCs to allow investors to take a tax-free sum from the plans. But in the absence of such a reform, Nunn says: 'It's likely to be AVCs for the higher paid and stakeholder [or personal pensions] for the rest.' </p> <p>Herein lies an important point. Many occupational scheme members do have annual salaries in excess of \u00a330,000. Indeed, investors who can afford to make extra pensions savings are likely to be those earning higher incomes. </p> <p>Equally, some people will want to make top-up pension contributions of more than \u00a33,600 a year. These investors will have to continue using AVCs and FSAVCs. In the vast majority of cases, financial advisers say AVCs are the better option. </p> <p>As these schemes are run on behalf of many members, rather than one individual, providers are generally able to offer cheaper fees. In the past, in-house AVCs have been criticised for offering a poor range of investment options. Most schemes, however, have now improved the choices available to pension investors. </p> <p>Finally, it is worth pointing out that investors do not have to save for old age via a dedicated pension plan. </p> <p>Roddy Kohn, principal of independent financial adviser Kohn Cougar, argues: 'People earning more or less than \u00a330,000 would also be well advised to look at individual savings accounts, which will give them far more flexibility.' </p> <p>\u0095 This article is taken from the October issue of Money Observer, on sale at newsagents, price \u00a33.50.

Ministers say they will not allow providers to levy charges other than an annual management fee of no more than 1 per cent. 'Stakeholders may be less expensive than in-house AVCs,' she says. 'The Government's charges cap has already been bettered: providers intend to offer products at between 0.4 and 0.6 per cent a year.' Either way, it is likely that from April, a personal or stakeholder pension will be the best way to top up pension savings if you are an occupational scheme member with this option. The Association of British Insurers is lobbying to change the rules on AVCs and FSAVCs to allow investors to take a tax-free sum from the plans. But in the absence of such a reform, Nunn says: 'It's likely to be AVCs for the higher paid and stakeholder [or personal pensions] for the rest.' Herein lies an important point. Many occupational scheme members do have annual salaries in excess of \u00a330,000. Indeed, investors who can afford to make extra pensions savings are likely to be those earning higher incomes. Equally, some people will want to make top-up pension contributions of more than \u00a33,600 a year. These investors will have to continue using AVCs and FSAVCs. In the vast majority of cases, financial advisers say AVCs are the better option. As these schemes are run on behalf of many members, rather than one individual, providers are generally able to offer cheaper fees. In the past, in-house AVCs have been criticised for offering a poor range of investment options. Most schemes, however, have now improved the choices available to pension investors. Finally, it is worth pointing out that investors do not have to save for old age via a dedicated pension plan. Roddy Kohn, principal of independent financial adviser Kohn Cougar, argues: 'People earning more or less than \u00a330,000 would also be well advised to look at individual savings accounts, which will give them far more flexibility.' \u0095 This article is taken from the October issue of Money Observer, on sale at newsagents, price \u00a33.50.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> For starters </strong> </p> <p> If you are a recent graduate, you are probably ahead of the game. Financial advisers are finding that the current generation can cope with debt far more happily than their older siblings. 'Five years ago, students were angry about getting into debt,' says Martin Preator of the Barclays bank branch at the University of Bath. 'But nowadays they generally accept it.' </p> <p>Ian Carter, welfare manager at the Student Advice Centre at Sussex University, has a similar view: 'Students never cease to amaze me. The revolutionary student seems to have died. Today's students seem far more attuned to the idea of taking credit than previous generations.' </p> <p>Someone in Carter's position might well have lambasted the Government five, 10 or 20 years ago for imposing such large debts on graduates. But even as he prepares to offer advice to graduates with \u00a315,000 of debt next summer, he does not expect to see more hardship. 'They might have a big debt to repay - but the repayment plan is a very good one.' </p> <p>A side benefit could be that they actually become far better money managers than their parents. 'Neither a lender nor a borrower be' may once have been good advice but it is clearly inap propriate now for people who can take on the discipline of debt repayment. </p> <p> <strong> Student loan company debts</strong> </p> <p> The Glasgow-based SLC lends at very advantageous rates so it is well worth borrowing from them (if you need more than the \u00a31,000 to \u00a32,000 that you can get as a student in the form of a free bank overdraft). The rates are pegged to inflation - and are currently 2.6 per cent. There are about 2.5 million 'live' accounts handled by the SLC - including both new borrowers and people who are repaying. </p> <p>Many new students form a poor impression of the SLC when they first try to draw down their loans. But this is not always the SLC's fault. The present loan application system is notoriously cumbersome and involves assessment of students' eligibility by the local education authorities. Students have often experienced delays - especially at this time of year - in getting through on the SLC hotline (0800 405010). </p> <p>Problems often come when the loan is due to be repaid. Repayments are programmed to start the April after graduation. At present money is removed from the new graduate's account by direct debit - under an authorisation they gave when they took out the loan - unless the graduate asks for deferment. About 550,000 graduates were allowed to defer payments this year. </p> <p>But some students and graduates create problems for themselves by moving house and not giving their new address to the SLC. They therefore do not get the reminder notices and are shocked when the first payment is taken out of their bank account. If they then fit the criteria for deferment, they can stop future deductions but they will not get that first repayment back. </p> <p>A new system of repayment comes into place next April through which graduates repay 9 per cent of any income they earn above \u00a310,000. On a \u00a315,000 salary, they would repay \u00a337 a month. On \u00a320,000, they would repay \u00a375 a month. Until then, graduates repay a fixed amount a month (to repay the debt in five to seven years) once their salary reaches 85 per cent of national average earnings. (The current threshold is an annual salary of \u00a319,104, or \u00a31,592 a month.) </p> <p>If you have problems with repayment, it is best to keep the SLC informed and to negotiate with them. </p> <p> <strong> Bank debts</strong> </p> <p> You can get an interest-free overdraft of up to \u00a32,000 for up to two years if you take up the best deals. Lloyds TSB offers this - the others rather less. The banks should be eager for your custom even if you have large debts. They are increasingly trying to recruit customers with future high earnings potential so they are very keen to attract graduates. They will also offer credit cards and graduate loans at lower rates than for other adults. </p> <p>Expect to repay your bank loan in four to 10 years, depending on the loan size and lender. At Barclays, for instance, debts under \u00a35,000 are expected to be repaid in five years. Loans between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000 (the maximum graduate loan) have to be repaid in seven years. Set up two accounts, advises Ian Carter of Sussex University. Use one as a budget account into which your salary is paid each month. Set up monthly direct debits to pay your electricity, telephone, rent, mortgage, student loan and other crucial payments. Arrange for a transfer each month into your second account. This is your spending money. You are far less likely to overspend and get into financial difficulties if you impose this kind of discipline on yourself. </p> <p> <strong> Other debts</strong> </p> <p> 'A lot of people get into worse trouble in their first year after graduating than when they were students,' says Carter. 'Once you are earning, it is far easier for credit card companies to give you a card and a spending limit.' A minority of graduates find it difficult to cope with money. They fall into the obvious traps - running up debts on credit cards; storing up future trouble by not registering for council tax or with their utility suppliers; moving house without letting banks and creditors know; and not answering difficult letters. </p> <p>'You can get county court judgments for relatively small amounts of money - perhaps \u00a3600 or \u00a3700,' says Marsha Healy of the Manchester Central Citizens Advice Bureau. Once you have this kind of legal black mark against your name, you will find it extremely difficult to get a mortgage, open a building society account or get other forms of credit for several years. So avoiding these judgments is very important. Negotiation often saves the day. 'If we can get involved, we can often argue that it is a temporary situation and that the person's prospects are good,' says Healy. </p> <p>You will always want to be paying interest on debts at the lowest level possible. The disadvantage of credit cards is that they often charge interest rates of more than 20 per cent a year. You can usually find far better rates: from a bank, the Student Loan Company or a credit union perhaps. </p> <p>Many universities will not allow students to graduate if they still owe money for fees or accommodation. But times are changing. De Montfort University in Leicester, which used to take this approach, has just introduced an 'agreement' scheme under which students can still graduate if they explain the situation and agree to a repayment schedule. Other universities will probably go this way too. </p> <p> <strong> Mortgages </strong> </p> <p> Over the last few years there has been an increase in twenty-somethings renting rather than buying. This may be partly caused by the need for job mobility but the existence of graduate debt is a factor. The average first-time buyer is now 32, according to the Council for Mortgage Lenders. 'Postponing buying isn't necessarily a bad thing,' says Patrick Bunton of London &amp; Country Mortgages. 'If they are more mature, they might be able to handle the commitment better. We have seen young people who didn't really think the implications through and hadn't thought through what would happen, in a shared property, if someone wanted to leave.' </p> <p>On the other hand, being cautious can mean losing out on the potential gains of a rising property market. Someone who struggled to buy a \u00a370,000 flat in North London five years ago could now be putting it on the market for more than \u00a3170,000. Mortgage lenders are a traditionally cautious breed themselves and have always shied away from lending to people with debts. </p> <p>But they will almost undoubtedly become more imaginative over the next few years in the way they approach debt-laden graduates. Northern Rock stands out at the moment for offering loans worth 120 per cent of the property value in some circumstances. In five years, lenders could be falling over themselves to offer such deals. </p> <p> <strong> Pensions</strong> </p> <p> The question is whether you should concentrate on paying off past debts or if you should also start preparing for the future. Independent financial adviser Peter Smith of Hill Martin says the answer should depend on individual circumstances. 'There are people who can run long-term debt without a problem. But others should get rid of it as soon as possible because it weighs on them very heavily.' </p> <p>Whatever approach you take, he thinks you should have begun making pension contributions by the age of 30 at the latest: 'From 25 onwards the thought should be in the mind. If nothing has happened at 30, flashing lights should start.' Since many people want to retire by 50, they will need a good 25 years to pave the way and should really be making the payments by their mid-20s. </p> <p>Graduates who are offered membership of an employer's pension scheme should think particularly seriously about this option. In most schemes - apart from some group personal pensions and the new stakeholder pension - the employer will be offering to make pension contributions on your behalf. </p> <p>They could easily be putting in \u00a350 for every \u00a3100 that you contribute. And you also get tax relief on your contributions - so, if you pay tax at the basic rate of 22 per cent, a contribution from you of \u00a378 will be topped up by the Government with \u00a322 to make a total contribution of \u00a3100. It is an effective use of money which, in most circumstances, it would be a shame to miss out on. </p> <p>Employers have to make contributions to most of the pension schemes they run. But with group personal pensions they can opt out - although many of them still make some payment on behalf of employees. Under the new stakeholder scheme, which starts in April next year, all employers will be required to offer a scheme - a new requirement since offering a pension plan is voluntary at the moment. </p> <p>Although employers will not be forced to contribute to the stakeholder pension, many will. You or your employer will need to pay charges on the stakeholder pension - but the Govern ment has capped these at 1 per cent a year. </p> <p> <strong> 'Golden hellos'</strong> </p> <p> People graduating over the next 20 years will have some very strong cards to play with employers: in our aging population, there is a demographic shortage of young workers. Many companies are prepared to offer generous perks to attract young, talented staff. Andersen Consulting, for instance, is now offering a \u00a36,000 'golden hello' to new analysts in their first year of employment. A second tranche of money - \u00a34,000 - is to be paid to those new analysts a year later. Other businesses are following suit. Some also offer interest-free loans. </p> <p> <strong> Advice</strong> </p> <p> Many students keep their true debt levels secret from their parents. This may not be so unwise since many older people get very anxious about debt. However, obtaining some good advice can be useful. Basic guidelines on money management are now offered by many universities. De Montfort is seeing 100 students a day at its new Student Financial Advice Centre. Such places can also help you prepare for the financial demands of repaying your debts after university, when you might feel more isolated. </p> <p>If you get into financial difficulties, your bank might be able to help but a very useful source of help is Citizens Advice Bureaux. They have specialist debt advisers who will help you for free, work out budgets and repayment schedules with you and write letters to your creditors. You should nearly always avoid debt advisers who charge for their help. </p> <p>Take care also in your dealings with solicitors, accountants, insurance company and bank sales people and independent financial advisers. If you had a traditional education, you were probably taught to respect authority and to assume that you could rely on professionals. But many solicitors and accountants will charge you at least \u00a350 an hour for theoretical advice. Sales people are trained to sell financial products and will want you to buy something. Most financial advisers make their money through commission on the products they sell you. </p> <p>One of the great truths of life in the big bad world is that you need to be sceptical when dealing with professionals who say they have your interests at heart.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For starters If you are a recent graduate, you are probably ahead of the game. Financial advisers are finding that the current generation can cope with debt far more happily than their older siblings. 'Five years ago, students were angry about getting into debt,' says Martin Preator of the Barclays bank branch at the University of Bath. 'But nowadays they generally accept it.' Ian Carter, welfare manager at the Student Advice Centre at Sussex University, has a similar view: 'Students never cease to amaze me. The revolutionary student seems to have died. Today's students seem far more attuned to the idea of taking credit than previous generations.' Someone in Carter's position might well have lambasted the Government five, 10 or 20 years ago for imposing such large debts on graduates. But even as he prepares to offer advice to graduates with \u00a315,000 of debt next summer, he does not expect to see more hardship. 'They might have a big debt to repay - but the repayment plan is a very good one.' A side benefit could be that they actually become far better money managers than their parents. 'Neither a lender nor a borrower be' may once have been good advice but it is clearly inap propriate now for people who can take on the discipline of debt repayment. Student loan company debts The Glasgow-based SLC lends at very advantageous rates so it is well worth borrowing from them (if you need more than the \u00a31,000 to \u00a32,000 that you can get as a student in the form of a free bank overdraft). The rates are pegged to inflation - and are currently 2.6 per cent. There are about 2.5 million 'live' accounts handled by the SLC - including both new borrowers and people who are repaying. Many new students form a poor impression of the SLC when they first try to draw down their loans. But this is not always the SLC's fault. The present loan application system is notoriously cumbersome and involves assessment of students' eligibility by the local education authorities. Students have often experienced delays - especially at this time of year - in getting through on the SLC hotline (0800 405010). Problems often come when the loan is due to be repaid. Repayments are programmed to start the April after graduation. At present money is removed from the new graduate's account by direct debit - under an authorisation they gave when they took out the loan - unless the graduate asks for deferment. About 550,000 graduates were allowed to defer payments this year. But some students and graduates create problems for themselves by moving house and not giving their new address to the SLC. They therefore do not get the reminder notices and are shocked when the first payment is taken out of their bank account. If they then fit the criteria for deferment, they can stop future deductions but they will not get that first repayment back. A new system of repayment comes into place next April through which graduates repay 9 per cent of any income they earn above \u00a310,000. On a \u00a315,000 salary, they would repay \u00a337 a month. On \u00a320,000, they would repay \u00a375 a month. Until then, graduates repay a fixed amount a month (to repay the debt in five to seven years) once their salary reaches 85 per cent of national average earnings. (The current threshold is an annual salary of \u00a319,104, or \u00a31,592 a month.) If you have problems with repayment, it is best to keep the SLC informed and to negotiate with them. Bank debts You can get an interest-free overdraft of up to \u00a32,000 for up to two years if you take up the best deals. Lloyds TSB offers this - the others rather less. The banks should be eager for your custom even if you have large debts. They are increasingly trying to recruit customers with future high earnings potential so they are very keen to attract graduates. They will also offer credit cards and graduate loans at lower rates than for other adults. Expect to repay your bank loan in four to 10 years, depending on the loan size and lender. At Barclays, for instance, debts under \u00a35,000 are expected to be repaid in five years. Loans between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000 (the maximum graduate loan) have to be repaid in seven years. Set up two accounts, advises Ian Carter of Sussex University. Use one as a budget account into which your salary is paid each month. Set up monthly direct debits to pay your electricity, telephone, rent, mortgage, student loan and other crucial payments. Arrange for a transfer each month into your second account. This is your spending money. You are far less likely to overspend and get into financial difficulties if you impose this kind of discipline on yourself. Other debts 'A lot of people get into worse trouble in their first year after graduating than when they were students,' says Carter. 'Once you are earning, it is far easier for credit card companies to give you a card and a spending limit.' A minority of graduates find it difficult to cope with money. They fall into the obvious traps - running up debts on credit cards; storing up future trouble by not registering for council tax or with their utility suppliers; moving house without letting banks and creditors know; and not answering difficult letters. 'You can get county court judgments for relatively small amounts of money - perhaps \u00a3600 or \u00a3700,' says Marsha Healy of the Manchester Central Citizens Advice Bureau.

At the moment he is getting off quite lightly because his eldest child, Eleanor, 20, has just started a midwifery course. She gets her fees paid and receives a bursary of \u00a3100 a month.

This is a 12-year-old Citro\u00ebn eight-seater that we have owned for eight years.' They have another two cars which are both classics but not expensive to run. One car is a 1960 Ford Prefect which Don uses to get to work and the other a 1968 Morris Minor that has just got through its MOT. Eleanor wants this to commute between university and hospital but Don is worried about insurance costs: 'She is already a named driver on our insurance but then she will become the main driver.' Despite the two classics, cars are not Don's hobby: 'I only tinker with the cars when I have to. Most of the time it is point and pay - you point out what is wrong with it and pay someone else to do it.' </p> <p>A major expense this year was a holiday in Australia for the whole family: 'We wanted to go to Sydney, despite the fact that it was a long way.' </p> <p>Their four-bedroom house is worth about \u00a3150,000 although, as an 80-year-old 'one-off', it is difficult to value without putting it on the market. They have an interest-only mortgage of \u00a345,000 with Direct Line, covered by four life insurance policies, three with Sun Alliance and one with Barclays Life. These mature over the next three years, with a projected surplus of \u00a316,800. </p> <p>Don's job includes life insurance and long-term sickness insurance. They also have a joint whole-life insurance policy for \u00a340,000 which pays out when the first one dies. </p> <p>He contributes 10 per cent of his salary to a Norwich Union pension and his employer puts in 7 per cent. Although his youngest son will still be facing GCSEs when Don is 65, he is toying with the idea of early retirement: 'I'd retire tomorrow if I could and it has been suggested that I might be able to retire two or three years early because there will be sufficient funds for me to take retirement. But I would like to know if I am contributing enough.'</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Joanne Cox</strong></p> <p>The spread of the children's ages means that Don and Wendy have plenty of time to save and, when the mortgage is repaid, will have extra disposable income as well as a lump sum. </p> <p>As they want to change their car, and Adele is 15, their short-term needs are the more pressing. They should choose between National Savings and bank and building society accounts. For tax relief, they should maximise contributions to a mini cash Isa and take out another next year.</p> <p>For the longer term, the best returns come from equity Isas, provided Don and Wendy are comfortable investing in a share-based fund. They should write down their income and expenditure to see how much it costs to keep the family afloat each month and plan forward for up to 15 years, then check if Don's sickness insurance continues if he is ill for a long time, and whether they could manage if Wendy was ill. If not, they should think about health insurance.</p> <p>Don should budget for after retirement, remembering that some costs will disappear but others increase, particularly for leisure activities. If his projected pension does not cover the planned expenditure, he should save more. Wendy should check whether she can join an employer's pension scheme or look for a low-cost stakeholder pension next April.</p> <p>The lump sum from the endowments could be used to repay any loans and the excess invested for future university costs. </p> <p>\u0095 Joanne Cox works for Co-operative Bank Financial Advisers.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Lynne Maltby </strong></p> <p>Don should bear in mind that the easiest way to increase income is to reduce outgoings. His monthly expenses will be fairly static until 2002 when the mortgage is scheduled for repayment. In the meantime, he could move his \u00a35,000 loan on to his mortgage which will immediately release spare cash. This, in turn, could be diverted towards Eleanor's university costs. </p> <p>The good news, of course, is that come September 2002 his monthly outgoings will reduce substantially, by about \u00a3450. At that time he should start a short-term cash-based saving scheme for Adele and Charlotte's university costs and look at a longer-term savings structure for the three younger children.</p> <p>Regular saving maxi Isas are appropriate for his five- year objective as they provide tax-free flexibility and a range of low to medium-risk funds.</p> <p>The mortgage is pivotal to Don's financial planning as it looks likely that an extra \u00a315,000 lump sum will be available when his endowments mature. So, as well as having more money to save each month, he should use at least a proportion of the lump sum either to kickstart the savings regime or to provide an additional retirement fund for himself and Wendy.</p> <p>They could think about remortgaging their home, using a repayment mortgage vehicle to tie in with Don's retirement age. This releases equity for their substantial university funding needs. </p> <p>\u0095 Lynne Maltby is a manager with Willis National. </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only. </p> <p>\u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

Adviser 1: Joanne Cox The spread of the children's ages means that Don and Wendy have plenty of time to save and, when the mortgage is repaid, will have extra disposable income as well as a lump sum. As they want to change their car, and Adele is 15, their short-term needs are the more pressing. They should choose between National Savings and bank and building society accounts. For tax relief, they should maximise contributions to a mini cash Isa and take out another next year. For the longer term, the best returns come from equity Isas, provided Don and Wendy are comfortable investing in a share-based fund. They should write down their income and expenditure to see how much it costs to keep the family afloat each month and plan forward for up to 15 years, then check if Don's sickness insurance continues if he is ill for a long time, and whether they could manage if Wendy was ill. If not, they should think about health insurance. Don should budget for after retirement, remembering that some costs will disappear but others increase, particularly for leisure activities. If his projected pension does not cover the planned expenditure, he should save more. Wendy should check whether she can join an employer's pension scheme or look for a low-cost stakeholder pension next April. The lump sum from the endowments could be used to repay any loans and the excess invested for future university costs. \u0095 Joanne Cox works for Co-operative Bank Financial Advisers. Adviser 2: Lynne Maltby Don should bear in mind that the easiest way to increase income is to reduce outgoings. His monthly expenses will be fairly static until 2002 when the mortgage is scheduled for repayment. In the meantime, he could move his \u00a35,000 loan on to his mortgage which will immediately release spare cash. This, in turn, could be diverted towards Eleanor's university costs. The good news, of course, is that come September 2002 his monthly outgoings will reduce substantially, by about \u00a3450. At that time he should start a short-term cash-based saving scheme for Adele and Charlotte's university costs and look at a longer-term savings structure for the three younger children. Regular saving maxi Isas are appropriate for his five- year objective as they provide tax-free flexibility and a range of low to medium-risk funds. The mortgage is pivotal to Don's financial planning as it looks likely that an extra \u00a315,000 lump sum will be available when his endowments mature. So, as well as having more money to save each month, he should use at least a proportion of the lump sum either to kickstart the savings regime or to provide an additional retirement fund for himself and Wendy. They could think about remortgaging their home, using a repayment mortgage vehicle to tie in with Don's retirement age. This releases equity for their substantial university funding needs. \u0095 Lynne Maltby is a manager with Willis National. Advice is for guidance only. \u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

      "body": "<p>New collectables are cropping up all the time. Ten years ago, collectors of antique fishing tackle, fountain pens, vinyl records and even modern first-edition books were thought to be chucking their money away. More recently, vintage television sets, HMS Titanic memorabilia, TV show tie-in toys and Beanie babies all found a market, and handbags and tattooists' accessories now vie for places in Miller's Collectables Price Guide. </p> <p>But some collectables are 'sleepers' in that it takes more than a year or two, or perhaps a decade, for collectors to notice them. Centuries may pass before they are recognised and their prices begin to rise. </p> <p>Two such sleepers will be for sale at two forthcoming fairs in London. Pieces made by cabinet makers' apprentices will be at this week's Lapada (the former London and Provincial Art and Antique Dealers' Association) Fine Art and Antiques Fair at the Commonwealth Institute, in west London. And custard cups, used originally for serving consomm\u00e9, will be at Olympia next month. Both date back to the eighteenth century and both, in their time, have been mistaken for other things. </p> <p>The miniature chests of drawers, chairs and tables have sometimes been mistaken for dolls' house furniture. But while they are small enough to hold in the hand, they are too big for dolls' houses. </p> <p>A second glance reveals exquisite dovetailing and mitring, drawers that fit so perfectly that they emit a puff of air when closed. Too fine for the playroom, the purpose of this miniaturisation was not to amuse children but to test the precision of the teenage apprentices' craftsmanship. </p> <p>Helen Linfield, of the Sussex dealer Wakelin and Linfield, will be offering a selection of apprentice pieces at the fair. These were 'portable examples of the cabinet maker's abilities', she says. </p> <p>'Miniature furniture was sometimes displayed in shops as examples of pieces that could be made full-size. Not many pieces survive from before the beginning of the eighteenth century. </p> <p>'I love the craftsmanship; the detail. In the finest pieces, the proportions are correct - even the locks are to scale - and the veneers are matched. They are identical replicas.' Today, miniature bureau bookcases with many little drawers are sometimes used to store jewellery and cufflinks. </p> <p>Custard cups are just as versatile. They are sometimes called cream cups, mustard pots, and even mistaken for bourdaloues, those ceramic chamber pots used discreetly by ladies in carriages and at the theatre. 'Custard cup' is actually a change of use by the British that has obliterated knowledge of the dazzling regal origins of these 7-8cm tall porcelain pots with lids and single handles. </p> <p>Custard, indeed! They were designed to drink from, and contained rich consomm\u00e9 made from the roast at royal banquets in France of almost unimaginable splendour. </p> <p>Among eighteenth century European royalty, following the re-invention of porcelain at Meissen, there was a mania for dinner services. Sometimes comprising more than 2,000 pieces, they took years to make and cost more than their weight in gold. They became symbols of power, gifts to foster international alliances, influence betrothals and reward loyalty. Napoleon gave them to friends and enemies alike. Catherine the Great of Russia owned 20 or 30. </p> <p>With the prized porcelain as a centrepiece, dinners were pure theatre. Seven or eight courses, 20 or more dishes at each course, and a footman standing behind each diner to reach for dishes laid out like a formal garden amid fountains, statuary and chandeliers. The eating and drinking could last six hours. </p> <p>Into this fabulous display were brought the jewels of the dinner service: lidded, single-handled pots \u00e0 jus containing hot, rich consomm\u00e9. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in England, the farmer king George III would have none of such junketing. He did not collect dinner services and was unusual among European royalty in not owning a porcelain factory. So when the English aristocracy began importing continental porcelain, the little pots \u00e0 jus were a mystery. But English ingenuity was not to be defeated. They became custard cups. </p> <p>A solecism, perhaps, but their incorrect use has inspired some tasty recipes for custard-and-liqueur desserts and syllabubs. A couple are given below. </p> <p>More than 80 European factories made 'custard cups' in that century. Besides the top-ranking S\u00e8vres, they included Chantilly, Sceaux, Mennecy and Bough le Reine. Potteries in this country also made them. </p> <p>A collection of more than 350 custard cups - the biggest ever assembled - will be displayed at Olympia by Ulla Stafford, who will have about 30 to sell. </p> <p>Her newly published book, Custard Cups: Pots \u00e0 Jus , illustrates them and explores the various, confusing names they have been called. In nineteenth century France, bourgeoisie outside the palace banquet circuit who bought them separately began calling them pots \u00e0 cr\u00e8me, the Swedes called them jelly cups, the Germans cr\u00e8me topfchen or cocots, and the Danes iis cups - ice cups. The book is a must-have for collectors hoping to spot wrongly identified and cheap custard cups on sale. </p> <p>Stafford says: 'If you've got the knowledge, you can do extremely well. But it's going to take me another few years before I have completely cracked their history.' </p> <p>Not only antique collectors but chefs and gastronomes should take a hint from her discoveries, for today the convenience and practicality of drinking a small quantity of hot, highly concentrated concoction from a pot \u00e0 jus has been all but forgotten. Only the French preserve a vestige of it, using them to serve turtle soup. </p> <p>Among those in the know, prices of custard cups are rising. A French dealer was recently asking \u00a33,000 for a pair of apple green S\u00e8vres cups. Made in 1771, they had fetched \u00a3150 at a London auction, then been sold for \u00a3300 in London's Camden Passage antiques market to a trader who sold them on to him for \u00a3900. Stafford persuaded the French dealer to part with them for \u00a32,200. They are now part of her collection, and not for sale. </p> <p>If you come across a set of six custard cups that have not been parted from their matching porcelain tray, it will be worth five figures. </p> <p>At the fair, she will be offering printed English custard cups of 1790-1820 from \u00a3250 each. A Vienna cup of 1792 is priced at \u00a3450. A F\u00fcrstenberg cup of 1765 and a 1760 Mennecy cup are \u00a3600 each. </p> <p>Custard cups seldom appear at auction, are occasionally mis-catalogued, usually lotted together with other pieces, and sometimes go unnoticed. Prices are therefore patchy. At Christie's in South Kensington last month, two S\u00e8vres cups of 1775, correctly described as both custard cups and pots \u00e0 jus, together with a flat 'sauce tureen' of 1763 that some would swear was a matching tray, had estimated prices of between \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,500 the pair. They were snapped up for \u00a31,292. </p> <p>At Bonhams and Brooks a year ago, eight Wedgwood custard cups from the nineteenth century, lotted among 22 other pieces, went for \u00a3253 (estimate \u00a3150-\u00a3250) and the previous year another eight English ones, in a lot of 17 pieces, fetched \u00a3275 (estimate \u00a3100-\u00a3150). </p> <p>Only last month, at Phillips, bidders pushed the price of two English Caughley custard cups of 1785-95, both with minor chips, to a whopping \u00a3575 the pair (estimate:\u00a3160-\u00a3200). </p> <p>As for apprentice pieces, which are now in demand by American collectors, auction prices are now comfortably exceeding estimates. At Bonhams and Brooks in April a George II miniature walnut and feather banded bureau with unusual glazed fall, 24cm tall, exceeded its estimate of between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000, selling for \u00a34,370. </p> <p>The Sussex dealer Helen Linfield says: 'Miniature pieces can command prices as high as their full-size counterparts, from as little as \u00a3500 for a country-made chest of drawers to \u00a325,000 for an exquisite, accurately proportioned bureau bookcase.' </p> <p>At the fair, Ingrid Nelson of Cranbrook, Kent, will be offering a 44cm high English miniature bureau in oak with brass fittings, the fall revealing six small drawers and six arched compartments, priced at \u00a35,750. </p> <p><strong>More information</strong></p> <p> The Lapada Fine Art and Antiques Fair is at the Commonwealth Institute, Kensington High Street, London W8, from 18-20 October.

      "bodyText": "New collectables are cropping up all the time. Ten years ago, collectors of antique fishing tackle, fountain pens, vinyl records and even modern first-edition books were thought to be chucking their money away. More recently, vintage television sets, HMS Titanic memorabilia, TV show tie-in toys and Beanie babies all found a market, and handbags and tattooists' accessories now vie for places in Miller's Collectables Price Guide. But some collectables are 'sleepers' in that it takes more than a year or two, or perhaps a decade, for collectors to notice them. Centuries may pass before they are recognised and their prices begin to rise. Two such sleepers will be for sale at two forthcoming fairs in London. Pieces made by cabinet makers' apprentices will be at this week's Lapada (the former London and Provincial Art and Antique Dealers' Association) Fine Art and Antiques Fair at the Commonwealth Institute, in west London. And custard cups, used originally for serving consomm\u00e9, will be at Olympia next month. Both date back to the eighteenth century and both, in their time, have been mistaken for other things. The miniature chests of drawers, chairs and tables have sometimes been mistaken for dolls' house furniture. But while they are small enough to hold in the hand, they are too big for dolls' houses. A second glance reveals exquisite dovetailing and mitring, drawers that fit so perfectly that they emit a puff of air when closed. Too fine for the playroom, the purpose of this miniaturisation was not to amuse children but to test the precision of the teenage apprentices' craftsmanship. Helen Linfield, of the Sussex dealer Wakelin and Linfield, will be offering a selection of apprentice pieces at the fair. These were 'portable examples of the cabinet maker's abilities', she says. 'Miniature furniture was sometimes displayed in shops as examples of pieces that could be made full-size. Not many pieces survive from before the beginning of the eighteenth century. 'I love the craftsmanship; the detail. In the finest pieces, the proportions are correct - even the locks are to scale - and the veneers are matched. They are identical replicas.' Today, miniature bureau bookcases with many little drawers are sometimes used to store jewellery and cufflinks. Custard cups are just as versatile. They are sometimes called cream cups, mustard pots, and even mistaken for bourdaloues, those ceramic chamber pots used discreetly by ladies in carriages and at the theatre. 'Custard cup' is actually a change of use by the British that has obliterated knowledge of the dazzling regal origins of these 7-8cm tall porcelain pots with lids and single handles. Custard, indeed! They were designed to drink from, and contained rich consomm\u00e9 made from the roast at royal banquets in France of almost unimaginable splendour. Among eighteenth century European royalty, following the re-invention of porcelain at Meissen, there was a mania for dinner services. Sometimes comprising more than 2,000 pieces, they took years to make and cost more than their weight in gold. They became symbols of power, gifts to foster international alliances, influence betrothals and reward loyalty. Napoleon gave them to friends and enemies alike. Catherine the Great of Russia owned 20 or 30. With the prized porcelain as a centrepiece, dinners were pure theatre. Seven or eight courses, 20 or more dishes at each course, and a footman standing behind each diner to reach for dishes laid out like a formal garden amid fountains, statuary and chandeliers. The eating and drinking could last six hours. Into this fabulous display were brought the jewels of the dinner service: lidded, single-handled pots \u00e0 jus containing hot, rich consomm\u00e9. Meanwhile, in England, the farmer king George III would have none of such junketing. He did not collect dinner services and was unusual among European royalty in not owning a porcelain factory. So when the English aristocracy began importing continental porcelain, the little pots \u00e0 jus were a mystery. But English ingenuity was not to be defeated. They became custard cups. A solecism, perhaps, but their incorrect use has inspired some tasty recipes for custard-and-liqueur desserts and syllabubs. A couple are given below. More than 80 European factories made 'custard cups' in that century. Besides the top-ranking S\u00e8vres, they included Chantilly, Sceaux, Mennecy and Bough le Reine. Potteries in this country also made them. A collection of more than 350 custard cups - the biggest ever assembled - will be displayed at Olympia by Ulla Stafford, who will have about 30 to sell. Her newly published book, Custard Cups: Pots \u00e0 Jus , illustrates them and explores the various, confusing names they have been called. In nineteenth century France, bourgeoisie outside the palace banquet circuit who bought them separately began calling them pots \u00e0 cr\u00e8me, the Swedes called them jelly cups, the Germans cr\u00e8me topfchen or cocots, and the Danes iis cups - ice cups. The book is a must-have for collectors hoping to spot wrongly identified and cheap custard cups on sale. Stafford says: 'If you've got the knowledge, you can do extremely well. But it's going to take me another few years before I have completely cracked their history.' Not only antique collectors but chefs and gastronomes should take a hint from her discoveries, for today the convenience and practicality of drinking a small quantity of hot, highly concentrated concoction from a pot \u00e0 jus has been all but forgotten. Only the French preserve a vestige of it, using them to serve turtle soup. Among those in the know, prices of custard cups are rising. A French dealer was recently asking \u00a33,000 for a pair of apple green S\u00e8vres cups. Made in 1771, they had fetched \u00a3150 at a London auction, then been sold for \u00a3300 in London's Camden Passage antiques market to a trader who sold them on to him for \u00a3900. Stafford persuaded the French dealer to part with them for \u00a32,200. They are now part of her collection, and not for sale. If you come across a set of six custard cups that have not been parted from their matching porcelain tray, it will be worth five figures. At the fair, she will be offering printed English custard cups of 1790-1820 from \u00a3250 each. A Vienna cup of 1792 is priced at \u00a3450. A F\u00fcrstenberg cup of 1765 and a 1760 Mennecy cup are \u00a3600 each. Custard cups seldom appear at auction, are occasionally mis-catalogued, usually lotted together with other pieces, and sometimes go unnoticed. Prices are therefore patchy. At Christie's in South Kensington last month, two S\u00e8vres cups of 1775, correctly described as both custard cups and pots \u00e0 jus, together with a flat 'sauce tureen' of 1763 that some would swear was a matching tray, had estimated prices of between \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,500 the pair. They were snapped up for \u00a31,292. At Bonhams and Brooks a year ago, eight Wedgwood custard cups from the nineteenth century, lotted among 22 other pieces, went for \u00a3253 (estimate \u00a3150-\u00a3250) and the previous year another eight English ones, in a lot of 17 pieces, fetched \u00a3275 (estimate \u00a3100-\u00a3150). Only last month, at Phillips, bidders pushed the price of two English Caughley custard cups of 1785-95, both with minor chips, to a whopping \u00a3575 the pair (estimate:\u00a3160-\u00a3200). As for apprentice pieces, which are now in demand by American collectors, auction prices are now comfortably exceeding estimates. At Bonhams and Brooks in April a George II miniature walnut and feather banded bureau with unusual glazed fall, 24cm tall, exceeded its estimate of between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000, selling for \u00a34,370. The Sussex dealer Helen Linfield says: 'Miniature pieces can command prices as high as their full-size counterparts, from as little as \u00a3500 for a country-made chest of drawers to \u00a325,000 for an exquisite, accurately proportioned bureau bookcase.' At the fair, Ingrid Nelson of Cranbrook, Kent, will be offering a 44cm high English miniature bureau in oak with brass fittings, the fall revealing six small drawers and six arched compartments, priced at \u00a35,750.
