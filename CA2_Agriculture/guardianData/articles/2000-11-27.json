Certainly, one of the three teams promoted last season is in the hunt for a Uefa Cup place; it is not, however, the runners-up City, nor the champions Charlton, but George Burley's Ipswich. A bizarre refereeing performance at Portman Road in last season's play-off semi-final against Bolton may well have earned Ipswich a place in the Wembley final.

Manchester United may be in the same league but they look as if they are from a different stratosphere from some of their Premiership opponents. </p> <p>This was exhibition stuff, the only surprise being that Sir Alex Ferguson's team were made to wait so long before turning their superiority into the hard currency of goals. The first half was perhaps one of the most comprehensive 0-0 thrashings the Premiership has witnessed as Derby were being tickled to death.</p> <p>Teddy Sheringham got things rolling just after the hour with an adroit finish to a typical United move combining equal measures of fluency and creativity; and with that an air of inevitability descended on Pride Park.</p> <p>\"I felt at half-time it was going to be difficult to score here,\" said Ferguson, \"but once the first goal was scored the doors opened and it was very comfortable for us.\" </p> <p>Nicky Butt doubled the lead from 25 yards, Dwight Yorke rounded things off with his fourth of the season and in the end Ferguson could even substitute his goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, bringing on Raimond van der Gouw for nine minutes of jogging on the spot and precious little else. \"Aye,\" sighed Smith. \"I was just surprised they didn't replace the keeper with another centre-forward.\"</p> <p>Victory was achieved without David Beckham or Ryan Giggs but it would be wrong to say United lacked their usual width and penetration. Instead the 32,910 present were privy to a glimpse of the future and what they saw had them taking a deep gulp.</p> <p>The conveyor belt at Old Trafford has reeled off some mighty fine products in recent years and the name of Luke Chadwick, a scrawny old-fashioned type of winger with the build of a street urchin and feet as quick as a pickpocket's fingers, can be added to that illustrious list. </p> <p>There remains the small matter of displacing Beckham - or more realistically shunting him into a more central role - but, if his full league debut is anything to go by, this boy is going to be a star. \"He's lightning quick and brave with it,\" said Ferguson. \"He's a different type to David and, if he can break through, it will give us another option.\"</p> <p>The really ominous news is that Ferguson does not even regard Chadwick as the brightest prospect from the latest crop of emerging talent, that particular honour going to a 16-year-old midfielder from Glasgow by the name of Darren Fletcher. United's position of dominance looks to be founded on solid rock.</p>",

Teddy Sheringham got things rolling just after the hour with an adroit finish to a typical United move combining equal measures of fluency and creativity; and with that an air of inevitability descended on Pride Park. \"I felt at half-time it was going to be difficult to score here,\" said Ferguson, \"but once the first goal was scored the doors opened and it was very comfortable for us.\" Nicky Butt doubled the lead from 25 yards, Dwight Yorke rounded things off with his fourth of the season and in the end Ferguson could even substitute his goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, bringing on Raimond van der Gouw for nine minutes of jogging on the spot and precious little else. \"Aye,\" sighed Smith. \"I was just surprised they didn't replace the keeper with another centre-forward.\" Victory was achieved without David Beckham or Ryan Giggs but it would be wrong to say United lacked their usual width and penetration. Instead the 32,910 present were privy to a glimpse of the future and what they saw had them taking a deep gulp. The conveyor belt at Old Trafford has reeled off some mighty fine products in recent years and the name of Luke Chadwick, a scrawny old-fashioned type of winger with the build of a street urchin and feet as quick as a pickpocket's fingers, can be added to that illustrious list. There remains the small matter of displacing Beckham - or more realistically shunting him into a more central role - but, if his full league debut is anything to go by, this boy is going to be a star. \"He's lightning quick and brave with it,\" said Ferguson. \"He's a different type to David and, if he can break through, it will give us another option.\" The really ominous news is that Ferguson does not even regard Chadwick as the brightest prospect from the latest crop of emerging talent, that particular honour going to a 16-year-old midfielder from Glasgow by the name of Darren Fletcher. United's position of dominance looks to be founded on solid rock.",

      "bodyText": "These two sides have the best unbeaten records in the Second Division and they demonstrated why with unabated endeavour, an attacking style, and creative bent that belong to a more elevated station. As Wigan's manager Bruce Rioch said: \"This was an outstanding performance by two teams very much in form.\" Ashton Gate crowds are noisily partial by nature. Rioch noticed the way they rose in warm acclaim at the end. \"I was particularly impressed that they also cheered my team.\" Both clubs have emotional points to make. Wigan were walking away with promotion last season, yet in the end dissipated their clear advantage and finally, in extra-time, play-off agony, bade a needless goodbye to First Division aspirations. There was not much about this display to suggest they will repeat the mistake. Bristol City, also with a new manager, started the season as if there was little prospect of better times. The results were bad, the gates dropped and the directors washed the dirty contents of the boardroom with unedifying public vigour. They have now gone 14 games without defeat, pulling dramatically up from near the bottom. And Saturday's draw took Wigan off the top, though their all-round balance and the precision in their passing implied special qualities. The two goals came in the first seven minutes. Louis Carey, chasing back, could only bundle Andy Liddell's teasing, angled cross into the back of his own net. City, with almost their next raid, were level.

With a half-fit Chris Sutton repeatedly robbed by Amoruso, Martin O'Neill's team were also hindered by the inability of Bobby Petta and Didier Agathe to get anywhere on the flanks.

It all made Henrik Larsson's headed equaliser after 56 minutes a solitary flash on a black day for his side. </p> <p>\"We didn't play well and they did,\" O'Neill said afterwards. \"It's hard enough trying to play Rangers with 11 men on the park, never mind 10.

With Celtic in disarray following a prompt and dubiously positioned free-kick that Rangers quickly worked, Ferguson serenely lobbed the goalkeeper Robert Douglas and placed the ball inside a post. </p> <p>Larsson's header gave Celtic hope but they swiftly became unravelled and out-numbered after Thompson was asked to walk. Two goals followed within the space of eight minutes. Tore Andre Flo prodded the ball home from a yard following De Boer's corner and De Boer then headed a J\u00f6rg Albertz corner past Douglas. Amoruso added another header before Michael Mols scored late on to complete the rout. </p> <p>Advocaat was a little sour afterwards, accusing the press of being unnecessarily critical of Rangers, but the result and the pressure on him undoubtedly shaped this mindset. </p> <p>\"I have said all along that with all my players fit I think we are a good side and today we proved that,\" he said. \"Our play was excellent right from the very start.\" </p> <p>With a sense of rebirth Rangers can now more confidently face Kaiserslautern in the Uefa Cup on Thursday.</p>",

Basically, the postal application process takes four-five weeks, but I had less than three. So, the easiest thing to do was go directly to Australia House in London. I got the form I needed from the internet (<a href=\"http://www.australia.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">www.australia.org.uk</a>) so I was prepared with all I needed when I got there. There are loads of different types of visa: my one allows me to work, and is valid for a year. Australia house opens at 9am. We arrived at 9.30 and it was already packed, so go early! Still, it was only an hour and half wait and I got an instant visa which was brilliant. </p> <p>The same day I bought my bag. It's basically my walking house and wardrobe for the next six months, so I decided it was worth splashing out on a really comfy well strapped bag (actually, that was a gift from mum, so thanks again!). I'll tell you how much I love or hate it later! </p> <p>One tip that everybody has given me in every shop, is to travel light. Someone told me to lay out everything you're going to take, then halve it. I don't know about that - the idea of only taking enough underwear for a week is bad enough, along with the realisation that I'm going to have to do my own washing! On the other hand, I do plan to shop while I'm away. If I travel light to start with, I've got space to create an international wardrobe! </p> <p>Everything's been happening pretty quickly in the last week - in fact, this whole month has zoomed by. I've had my last day at work, and I've said a lot of goodbyes already to friends and family. It's beginning to sink in that I'm really going - every time I say 'see you in summer' it reminds me that this isn't just a big dream. It also reminds me that I should have a nine-month summer this year. (From Hawaii on, and then back to England for summer). I bet you wish you were going too now?! </p> <p>I've now got my tickets and camera and equipment, so basically everything's actually come together, which I was never quite sure it would. It was really exciting seeing the web site up and running, although a little scary to think my picture/writing is literally accessible to everyone.

It is bound to cause nervousness in the Labour Party with the Conservatives likely to claim the proposals represents Labour's hidden tax agenda ahead of the general election.</p> <p>The tax system takes disproportionately more from the poor, the report says, while the highest paid fifth of households are paying a lower proportion of their income in direct and indirect taxes than they were 20 years ago. Their tax burden has fallen from 37% of their income to 35%. By contrast, the tax burden on the bottom fifth of households has risen from 31% to 38% of their income.</p> <p>The main reason, for the change is the rise in indirect taxes such as VAT which affect the poor disproportionately.</p> <p>The inquiry criticises the government for adopting the same ideological stance over tax as the Conservatives, saying that its need to raise the tax burden in the first two years led to a strategy that was in practice similar to that of the Tories. \"With higher income tax rates ruled out, other forms of taxation were required,\" leading to an increase in indirect or stealth taxes.</p> <p>Fabian Society national secretary Michael Jacobs said there should be a national debate on whether Britain's taxes as a proportion of national income - now 37% - should rise closer to the European Union average of 41.5%. Increasing the tax burden to the EU average would bring an extra \u00a340bn of revenue into the Treasury's coffers.</p> <p>\"You only need to look around our collapsing public services to see the result of this lost revenue,\" Mr Jacobs said.</p> <p>The research shows that the vast majority of the public would prefer spending increases, to tax cuts. Some 80% of those polled wanted a 1p tax rise for health increases and only 16% favoured tax cuts.</p> <p>The new 50% tax bracket would raise \u00a33bn and could be used either to take 800,000 people on low incomes out of income tax altogether, or to take 480,000 out of tax and another 420,000 out of the 40% higher income tax bracket.</p>",

The inquiry was chaired by Lord Plant and drawn up by some of the leading tax experts in the Labour movement. It is bound to cause nervousness in the Labour Party with the Conservatives likely to claim the proposals represents Labour's hidden tax agenda ahead of the general election. The tax system takes disproportionately more from the poor, the report says, while the highest paid fifth of households are paying a lower proportion of their income in direct and indirect taxes than they were 20 years ago. Their tax burden has fallen from 37% of their income to 35%. By contrast, the tax burden on the bottom fifth of households has risen from 31% to 38% of their income. The main reason, for the change is the rise in indirect taxes such as VAT which affect the poor disproportionately. The inquiry criticises the government for adopting the same ideological stance over tax as the Conservatives, saying that its need to raise the tax burden in the first two years led to a strategy that was in practice similar to that of the Tories. \"With higher income tax rates ruled out, other forms of taxation were required,\" leading to an increase in indirect or stealth taxes. Fabian Society national secretary Michael Jacobs said there should be a national debate on whether Britain's taxes as a proportion of national income - now 37% - should rise closer to the European Union average of 41.5%. Increasing the tax burden to the EU average would bring an extra \u00a340bn of revenue into the Treasury's coffers. \"You only need to look around our collapsing public services to see the result of this lost revenue,\" Mr Jacobs said. The research shows that the vast majority of the public would prefer spending increases, to tax cuts. Some 80% of those polled wanted a 1p tax rise for health increases and only 16% favoured tax cuts. The new 50% tax bracket would raise \u00a33bn and could be used either to take 800,000 people on low incomes out of income tax altogether, or to take 480,000 out of tax and another 420,000 out of the 40% higher income tax bracket.",

He wins \u00a310,000 and a \u00a31,000 bet with William Hill. \"He can put it on himself to complete a Tour de France hat trick if he wants,\" said a spokesman. \"We've already made him 5/2 favourite to win it again next year. \" </p> <p>Armstrong's co-writer is the first woman in 12 years of the prize to win an award.</p> <p><strong>THE WINNER</strong></p> <p><strong>It's Not About The Bike: My Journey Back to Life, by Lance Armstrong with Sally Jenkins</strong> (Yellow Jersey, \u00a317) </p> <p>The best sporting stories are human dramas, and Lance Armstrong's is one of the greatest. At 25, the American cyclist was diagnosed with cancer. He fought it, beat it and three years later, amazingly, won the Tour de France. </p> <p>This is a gripping story: from tough, fatherless childhood (he pointedly calls his absentee father a \"DNA donor\"), through devastating illness, to triumph in the toughest endurance test in the world. His single-mindedness and strength of character shine through every page, and the reader is left with the impression that, after cancer, the Alps were a doddle. </p> <p>Much more about chemotherapy than cycling, but none the worse for that, though I could have done with a bit less moralising at the end (\"If there is a purpose to the suffering that is cancer, I think it must be this: it's meant to improve us\"). </p> <p> <strong>THE REST OF THE SHORTLIST</strong></p> <p><strong>Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football</strong>, by David Winner (Bloomsbury, \u00a314.99) </p> <p>This is football as art, metaphor, cultural signifier. The opening up of Dutch society in the 60s is paralleled by the rejection of outmoded footballing forms (defenders who just defend, attackers who merely attack). </p> <p>This could have been tiresomely pretentious but, thanks to Winner's lifelong fascination with his subject, it isn't. He adores Dutch football, both for its beauty and for the national team's ability to collapse when clearly superior to the opposition. </p> <p>He comes up with a novel thesis: \"Other nations may have produced greater goalscorers, more dazzling individual ball-artists, and more dependable and efficient tournament-winning teams. But no one has ever imagined or structured their play as abstractly, as architecturally, in such a measured fashion as the Dutch.\" </p> <p>The first chapter is numbered five; chapter one comes sixth. You will have to buy the book to discover the perfectly logical reason why. </p> <p><strong>Mystery Spinner: The Story of Jack Iverson, by Gideon Haigh</strong> (Aurum Press, \u00a318.99) </p> <p>Jack Iverson played five Tests for Australia half a century ago. His first-class career lasted barely three years. Not obvious material for a 376-page biography, but Gideon Haigh has written a superb book about him. </p> <p>Iverson didn't play top-flight cricket until he was 31.

      "bodyText": "The American cyclist Lance Armstrong has followed two consecutive wins of the Tour de France with the William Hill Sports Book of the Year or 'Bookie's Prize' for his autobiography It's Not About The Bike, written with Sally Jenkins. Armstrong's victory was announced at a ceremony in London on Monday November 27. He wins \u00a310,000 and a \u00a31,000 bet with William Hill. \"He can put it on himself to complete a Tour de France hat trick if he wants,\" said a spokesman. \"We've already made him 5/2 favourite to win it again next year. \" Armstrong's co-writer is the first woman in 12 years of the prize to win an award. THE WINNER It's Not About The Bike: My Journey Back to Life, by Lance Armstrong with Sally Jenkins (Yellow Jersey, \u00a317) The best sporting stories are human dramas, and Lance Armstrong's is one of the greatest. At 25, the American cyclist was diagnosed with cancer. He fought it, beat it and three years later, amazingly, won the Tour de France. This is a gripping story: from tough, fatherless childhood (he pointedly calls his absentee father a \"DNA donor\"), through devastating illness, to triumph in the toughest endurance test in the world. His single-mindedness and strength of character shine through every page, and the reader is left with the impression that, after cancer, the Alps were a doddle. Much more about chemotherapy than cycling, but none the worse for that, though I could have done with a bit less moralising at the end (\"If there is a purpose to the suffering that is cancer, I think it must be this: it's meant to improve us\"). THE REST OF THE SHORTLIST Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football, by David Winner (Bloomsbury, \u00a314.99) This is football as art, metaphor, cultural signifier. The opening up of Dutch society in the 60s is paralleled by the rejection of outmoded footballing forms (defenders who just defend, attackers who merely attack). This could have been tiresomely pretentious but, thanks to Winner's lifelong fascination with his subject, it isn't. He adores Dutch football, both for its beauty and for the national team's ability to collapse when clearly superior to the opposition. He comes up with a novel thesis: \"Other nations may have produced greater goalscorers, more dazzling individual ball-artists, and more dependable and efficient tournament-winning teams. But no one has ever imagined or structured their play as abstractly, as architecturally, in such a measured fashion as the Dutch.\" The first chapter is numbered five; chapter one comes sixth. You will have to buy the book to discover the perfectly logical reason why. Mystery Spinner: The Story of Jack Iverson, by Gideon Haigh (Aurum Press, \u00a318.99) Jack Iverson played five Tests for Australia half a century ago. His first-class career lasted barely three years. Not obvious material for a 376-page biography, but Gideon Haigh has written a superb book about him. Iverson didn't play top-flight cricket until he was 31. His rise thereafter was meteoric, but he never quite believed in himself and quickly abandoned playing for both Australia and his state, Victoria. He had a key role in retaining the Ashes for Australia in 1950-51 but then declared himself unavailable. Haigh brilliantly reconstructs this almost forgotten figure, without, as he admits, ever quite fathoming him, or understanding why, at the age of 58, he killed himself. The death is sad, yet the life is oddly inspiring: the cricketer who played Test cricket even though he could barely remember the names of the fielding positions. However, a cricket book won last year - and the judges looked elsewhere. Night Train: The Sonny Liston Story, by Nick Tosches (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a317.99) There is a great book to be written about Sonny Liston, but this isn't it. Nick Tosches can write almost too well: the self-consciousness of the writing gets in the way of a terrific story. He is also hung up on theories - that Liston threw both his fights with Ali, and that he was murdered by the mob. If he could prove any of this, fine, but he can't and we are left with supposition and speculation; poor substitutes for cold fact. We know we are in the hands of a writer from the opening page: the epigraph is from Aeschylus - \"This is a song for the one who is doomed, a blow to the heart that breaks the mind.\" Tosches is good on Liston's dirt-poor upbringing. He has covered the ground and talked to the people he grew up with, but a long riff on Aristotle and slavery breaks the spell. What on earth does Aristotle have to do with Sonny Liston? Peak Performance: Business Lessons From the World's Top Sports Organisations, by Clive Gilson, Mike Pratt, Kevin Roberts and Ed Weymes (HarperCollins, \u00a319.99) The subtitle gives the game away. This is not a sports book at all, but a business tome, written by academics who have toured the world (nice work if you can get it) analysing elite sports organisations to find out what makes them tick. The idea is that if you discover the secret of the All Blacks' success, you can apply it to your business and dominate your field. The 10 chosen outfits - including Bayern Munich and the Atlanta Braves - are intriguing, but the prose is leaden and the conclusions banal. This, for example, on the Australian Cricket Board: \"The organisation is at its best when it has earned the right to tell yet another story which adds a new ring to the contours of the cricketing soul.\" I never grasped the essence of peak performance organisation (PPO) theory, which is the book's holy grail. The Great Olympic Swindle: When the World Wanted its Games Back, by Andrew Jennings and Clare Sambrook (Simon &amp; Schuster, \u00a316.99) Andrew Jennings has spent a decade rooting out the \"culture of corruption\" endemic in the International Olympic Committee. This book is a blow-by-blow account of how Salt Lake City bribed its way to winning the 2002 Winter Olympics, and the crisis this produced within the IOC. Jennings and Sambrook have criss-crossed the world collecting evidence against the IOC and its president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, and have produced a powerful case for the prosecution.

      "trailText": "<p>The astronomical growth in the wealth and cultural influence of multi-national corporations over the last fifteen years can arguably be traced back to a single, seemingly innocuous idea developed by management theorists in the mid-1980s: that successful corporations must primarily produce brands, as opposed to products.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>The Brands Bounce Back</strong></p> <p>There were some brands that were watching from the sidelines as Wall Street declared the death of the brand. Funny, they must have thought, we don't feel dead. Just as the admen had predicted at the beginning of the recession, the companies that exited the downturn running were the ones who opted for marketing over value every time: Nike, Apple, the Body Shop, Calvin Klein, Disney, Levi's and Starbucks. Not only were these brands doing just fine, thank you very much, but the act of branding was becoming a larger and larger focus of their businesses. For these companies, the ostensible product was mere filler for the real production: the brand. They integrated the idea of branding into the very fabric of their companies. Their corporate cultures were so tight and cloistered that to outsiders they appeared to be a cross between fraternity house, religious cult and sanitarium. Everything was an ad for the brand: bizarre lexicons for describing employees (partners, baristas, team players, crew members), company chants, superstar CEOs, fanatical attention to design consistency, a propensity for monument-building, and New Age mission statements. Unlike classic household brand names, such as Tide and Marlboro, these logos weren't losing their currency, they were in the midst of breaking every barrier in the marketing world - becoming cultural accessories and lifestyle philosophers. These companies didn't wear their image like a cheap shirt - their image was so integrated with their business that other people wore it as their shirt. And when the brands crashed, these companies didn't even notice - they were branded to the bone.</p> <p>So the real legacy of Marlboro Friday is that it simultaneously brought the two most significant developments in nineties marketing and consumerism into sharp focus: the deeply unhip big-box bargain stores that provide the essentials of life and monopolize a disproportionate share of the market (Wal-Mart et al.) and the extra-premium \"attitude\" brands that provide the essentials of lifestyle and monopolize ever-expanding stretches of cultural space (Nike et al.). The way these two tiers of consumerism developed would have a profound impact on the economy in the years to come. When overall ad expenditures took a nosedive in 1991, Nike and Reebok were busy playing advertising chicken, with each company increasing its budget to outspend the other. In 1991 alone, Reebok upped its ad spending by 71.9 percent, while Nike pumped an extra 24.6 percent into its already soaring ad budget, bringing the company's total spending on marketing to a staggering $250 million annually. Far from worrying about competing on price, the sneaker pimps were designing ever more intricate and pseudoscientific air pockets, and driving up prices by signing star athletes to colossal sponsorship deals. The fetish strategy seemed to be working fine: in the six years prior to 1993, Nike had gone from a $750 million company to a $4 billion one and Phil Knight's Beaverton, Oregon, company emerged from the recession with profits 900 percent higher than when it began. Benetton and Calvin Klein, meanwhile, were also upping their spending on lifestyle marketing, using ads to associate their lines with risqu&amp;#233 art and progressive politics. Clothes barely appeared in these high-concept advertisements, let alone prices. Even more abstract was Absolut Vodka, which for some years now had been developing a marketing strategy in which its product disappeared and its brand was nothing but a blank bottle-shaped space that could be filled with whatever content a particular audience most wanted from its brands: intellectual in Harper's, futuristic in Wired, alternative in Spin, loud and proud in Out and \"Absolut Centerfold\" in Playboy. The brand reinvented itself as a cultural sponge, soaking up and morphing to its surroundings.</p> <p>Saturn, too, came out of nowhere in October 1990 when GM launched a car built not out of steel and rubber but out of New Age spirituality and seventies feminism. After the car had been on the market a few years, the company held a \"homecoming\" weekend for Saturn owners, during which they could visit the auto plant and have a cookout with the people who made their cars. As the Saturn ads boasted at the time, \"44,000 people spent their vacations with us, at a car plant.\" It was as if Aunt Jemima had come to life and invited you over to her house for dinner. In 1993, the year the Marlboro Man was temporarily hobbled by \"brand-blind\" consumers, Microsoft made its striking debut on Advertising Age's list of the top 200 ad spenders - the very same year that Apple computer increased its marketing budget by 30 percent after already making branding history with its Orwellian takeoff ad launch during the 1984 Super Bowl. Like Saturn, both companies were selling a hip new relationship to the machine that left Big Blue IBM looking as clunky and menacing as the now-dead Cold War. And then there were the companies that had always understood that they were selling brands before product. Coke, Pepsi, McDonald's, Burger King and Disney weren't fazed by the brand crisis, opting instead to escalate the brand war, especially since they had their eyes firmly fixed on global expansion. They were joined in this project by a wave of sophisticated producer/retailers who hit full stride in the late eighties and early nineties. The Gap, Ikea and the Body Shop were spreading like wildfire during this period, masterfully transforming the generic into the brand-specific, largely through bold, carefully branded packaging and the promotion of an \"experiential\" shopping environment. The Body Shop had been a presence in Britain since the seventies, but it wasn't until 1988 that it began sprouting like a green weed on every street corner in the U.S. Even during the darkest years of the recession, the company opened between forty and fifty American stores a year. Most baffling of all to Wall Street, it pulled off the expansion without spending a dime on advertising. Who needed billboards and magazine ads when retail outlets were three-dimensional advertisements for an ethical and ecological approach to cosmetics? The BodyShop was all brand.</p> <p>The Starbucks coffee chain, meanwhile, was also expanding during this period without laying out much in advertising; instead, it was spinning off its name into a wide range of branded projects: Starbucks airline coffee, office coffee, coffee ice cream, coffee beer. Starbucks seemed to understand brand names at a level even deeper than Madison Avenue, incorporating marketing into every fiber of its corporate concept - from the chain's strategic association with books, blues and jazz to its Euro-latte lingo. What the success of both the Body Shop and Starbucks showed was how far the branding project had come in moving beyond splashing one's logo on a billboard. Here were two companies that had fostered powerful identities by making their brand concept into a virus and sending it out into the culture via a variety of channels: cultural sponsorship, political controversy, the consumer experience and brand extensions. Direct advertising, in this context, was viewed as a rather clumsy intrusion into a much more organic approach to image building. Scott Bedbury, Starbucks' vice president of marketing, openly recognized that \"consumers don't truly believe there's a huge difference between products,\" which is why brands must \"establish emotional ties\" with their customers through \"the Starbucks Experience.\" The people who line up for Starbucks, writes CEO Howard Shultz, aren't just there for the coffee. \"It's the romance of the coffee experience, the feeling of warmth and community people get in Starbucks stores.\" </p> <p>Interestingly, before moving to Starbucks, Bedbury was head of marketing at Nike, where he oversaw the launch of the \"Just Do It!\" slogan, among other watershed branding moments. In the following passage, he explains the common techniques used to infuse the two very different brands with meaning: Nike, for example, is leveraging the deep emotional connection that people have with sports and fitness. With Starbucks, we see how coffee has woven itself into the fabric of people's lives, and that's our opportunity for emotional leverage. . . . A great brand raises the bar - it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters. </p> <p>This was the secret, it seemed, of all the success stories of the late eighties and early nineties. The lesson of Marlboro Friday was that there never really was a brand crisis - only brands that had crises of confidence. The brands would be okay, Wall Street concluded, so long as they believed fervently in the principles of branding and never, ever blinked. Overnight, \"Brands, not products!\" became the rallying cry for a marketing renaissance led by a new breed of companies that saw themselves as \"meaning brokers\" instead of product producers. What was changing was the idea of what - in both advertising and branding - was being sold. The old paradigm had it that all marketing was selling a product. In the new model, however, the product always takes a back seat to the real product, the brand, and the selling of the brand acquired an extra component that can only be described as spiritual. Advertising is about hawking product. Branding, in its truest and most advanced incarnations, is about corporate transcendence. It may sound flaky, but that's precisely the point. On Marlboro Friday, a line was drawn in the sand between the lowly price slashers and the high-concept brand builders. The brand builders conquered and a new consensus was born: the products that will flourish in the future will be the ones presented not as \"commodities\" but as concepts: the brand as experience, as lifestyle. </p> <p>Ever since, a select group of corporations has been attempting to free itself from the corporeal world of commodities, manufacturing and products to exist on another plane. Anyone can manufacture a product, they reason (and as the success of private-label brands during the recession proved, anyone did). Such menial tasks, therefore, can and should be farmed out to contractors and subcontractors whose only concern is filling the order on time and under budget (ideally in the Third World, where labor is dirt cheap, laws are lax and tax breaks come by the bushel). Headquarters, meanwhile, is free to focus on the real business at hand - creating a corporate mythology powerful enough to infuse meaning into these raw objects just by signing its name. The corporate world has always had a deep New Age streak, fed - it has become clear - by a profound need that could not be met simply by trading widgets for cash. But when branding captured the corporate imagination, New Age vision quests took center stage. As Nike CEO Phil Knight explains, \"For years we thought of ourselves as a production-oriented company, meaning we put all our emphasis on designing and manufacturing the product. But now we understand that the most important thing we do is market the product. We've come around to saying that Nike is a marketing-oriented company, and the product is our most important marketing tool.\" This project has since been taken to an even more advanced level with the emergence of on-line corporate giants such as Amazon.com. It is on-line that the purest brands are being built: liberated from the real-world burdens of stores and product manufacturing, these brands are free to soar, less as the disseminators of goods or services than as collective hallucinations. Tom Peters, who has long coddled the inner flake in many a hard-nosed CEO, latched on to the branding craze as the secret to financial success, separating the transcendental logos and the earthbound products into two distinct categories of companies. \"The top half - Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Disney, and so on - are pure 'players' in brainware. The bottom half [Ford and GM] are still lumpy-object purveyors, though automobiles are much 'smarter' than they used to be,\" Peters writes in The Circle of Innovation (1997), an ode to the power of marketing over production.</p> <p>When Levi's began to lose market share in the late nineties, the trend was widely attributed to the company's failure - despite lavish ad spending - to transcend its products and become a free-standing meaning. \"Maybe one of Levi's problems is that it has no Cola,\" speculated Jennifer Steinhauer in The New York Times. \"It has no denim-toned house paint. Levi makes what is essentially a commodity: blue jeans. Its ads may evoke rugged out-doorsmanship, but Levi hasn't promoted any particular life style to sell other products.\"</p> <p>In this high-stakes new context, the cutting-edge ad agencies no longer sold companies on individual campaigns but on their ability to act as \"brand stewards\": identifying, articulating and protecting the corporate soul. Not surprisingly, this spelled good news for the U.S. advertising industry, which in 1994 saw a spending increase of 8.6 percent over the previous year. In one year, the ad industry went from a near crisis to another \"best year yet.\" And that was only the beginning of triumphs to come. By 1997, corporate advertising, defined as \"ads that position a corporation, its values, its personality and character\" were up 18 percent from the year before. With this wave of brand mania has come a new breed of businessman, one who will proudly inform you that Brand X is not a product but a way of life, an attitude, a set of values, a look, an idea. And it sounds really great - way better than that Brand X is a screwdriver, or a hamburger chain, or a pair of jeans, or even a very successful line of running shoes. Nike, Phil Knight announced in the late eighties, is \"a sports company\"; its mission is not to sell shoes but to \"enhance people's lives through sports and fitness\" and to keep \"the magic of sports alive.\"</p> <p>Company president-cum-sneaker-shaman Tom Clark explains that \"the inspiration of sports allows us to rebirth ourselves constantly.\" Reports of such \"brand vision\" epiphanies began surfacing from all corners. \"Polaroid's problem,\" diagnosed the chairman of its advertising agency, John Hegarty, \"was that they kept thinking of themselves as a camera. But the '[brand] vision' process taught us something: Polaroid is not a camera - it's a social lubricant\". IBM isn't selling computers, it's selling business \"solutions.\" Swatch is not about watches, it is about the idea of time. At Diesel Jeans, owner Renzo Rosso told Paper magazine, \"We don't sell a product, we sell a style of life. I think we have created a movement. . . . The Diesel concept is everything. It's the way to live, it's the way to wear, it's the to do something.\" And as Body Shop founder Anita Roddick explained to me, her stores aren't about what they sell, they are the conveyers of a grand idea - a political philosophy about women, the environment and ethical business. \"I just use the company that I surprisingly created as a success - it shouldn't have been like this, it wasn't meant to be like this - to stand on the products to shout out on these issues,\" Roddick says. The famous late graphic designer Tibor Kalman summed up the shifting role of the brand this way: \"The original notion of the brand was quality, but now brand is a stylistic badge of courage.\"</p> <p>The idea of selling the courageous message of a brand, as opposed to a product, intoxicated these CEOs, providing as it did an opportunity for seemingly limitless expansion. After all, if a brand was not a product, it could be anything! And nobody embraced branding theory with more evangelical zeal than Richard Branson, whose Virgin Group has branded joint ventures in everything from music to bridal gowns to airlines to cola to financial services. Branson refers derisively to the \"stilted Anglo-Saxon view of consumers,\" which holds that a name should be associated with a product like sneakers or soft drinks, and opts instead for \"the Asian 'trick'\" of the keiretsus (a Japanese term meaning a network of linked corporations). The idea, he explains, is to \"build brands not around products but around reputation. The great Asian names imply quality, price and innovation rather than a specific item. I call these 'attribute' brands: They do not relate directly to one product - such as a Mars bar or a Coca-Cola - but instead to a set of values.\"</p> <p>Tommy Hilfiger, meanwhile, is less in the business of manufacturing clothes than he is in the business of signing his name. The company is run entirely through licensing agreements, with Hilfiger commissioning all its products from a group of other companies: Jockey International makes Hilfiger underwear, Pepe Jeans London makes Hilfiger jeans, Oxford Industries make Tommy shirts, the Stride Rite Corporation makes its footwear. What does Tommy Hilfiger manufacture? Nothing at all.</p> <p>So pass&amp;#233 had products become in the age of lifestyle branding that by the late nineties, newer companies like Lush cosmetics and Old Navy clothing began playing with the idea of old-style commodities as a source of retro marketing imagery. The Lush chain serves up its face masks and moisturizers out of refrigerated stainless-steel bowls, spooned into plastic containers with grocery-store labels. Old Navy showcases its shrink-wrapped T-shirts and sweatshirts in deli-style chrome refrigerators, as if they were meat or cheese. When you are a pure, concept-driven brand, the aesthetics of raw product can prove as \"authentic\" as loft living.</p> <p>And lest the branding business be dismissed as the playground of trendy consumer items such as sneakers, jeans and New Age beverages, think again. Caterpillar, best known for building tractors and busting unions, has barreled into the branding business, launching the Cat accessories line: boots, back-packs, hats and anything else calling out for a postindustrial je ne sais quoi. Intel Corp., which makes computer parts no one sees and few understand, transformed its processors into a fetish brand with TV ads featuring line workers in funky metallic space suits dancing to \"Shake Your Groove Thing.\" The Intel mascots proved so popular that the company has sold hundreds of thousands of bean-filled dolls modeled on the shimmery dancing technicians. Little wonder, then, that when asked about the company's decision to diversify its products, the senior vice president for sales and marketing, Paul S. Otellini, replied that Intel is \"like Coke. One brand, many different products.\" And if Caterpillar and Intel can brand, surely anyone can.</p> <p>There is, in fact, a new strain in marketing theory that holds that even the lowliest natural resources, barely processed, can develop brand identities, thus giving way to hefty premium-price markups. In an essay appropriately titled \"How to Brand Sand,\" advertising executives Sam I. Hill, Jack McGrath and Sandeep Dayal team up to tell the corporate world that with the right marketing plan, nobody has to stay stuck in the stuff business. \"Based on extensive research, we would argue that you can indeed brand not only sand, but also wheat, beef, brick, metals, concrete, chemicals, corn grits and an endless variety of commodities traditionally considered immune to the process.\" Over the past six years, spooked by the near-death experience of Marlboro Friday, global corporations have leaped on the brand-wagon with what can only be described as a religious fervor. Never again would the corporate world stoop to praying at the altar of the commodity market. From now on they would worship only graven media images. Or to quote Tom Peters, the brand man himself: \"Brand! Brand!! Brand!!! That's the message . . . for the late '90s and beyond.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Brands Bounce Back There were some brands that were watching from the sidelines as Wall Street declared the death of the brand. Funny, they must have thought, we don't feel dead. Just as the admen had predicted at the beginning of the recession, the companies that exited the downturn running were the ones who opted for marketing over value every time: Nike, Apple, the Body Shop, Calvin Klein, Disney, Levi's and Starbucks. Not only were these brands doing just fine, thank you very much, but the act of branding was becoming a larger and larger focus of their businesses. For these companies, the ostensible product was mere filler for the real production: the brand. They integrated the idea of branding into the very fabric of their companies. Their corporate cultures were so tight and cloistered that to outsiders they appeared to be a cross between fraternity house, religious cult and sanitarium. Everything was an ad for the brand: bizarre lexicons for describing employees (partners, baristas, team players, crew members), company chants, superstar CEOs, fanatical attention to design consistency, a propensity for monument-building, and New Age mission statements. Unlike classic household brand names, such as Tide and Marlboro, these logos weren't losing their currency, they were in the midst of breaking every barrier in the marketing world - becoming cultural accessories and lifestyle philosophers. These companies didn't wear their image like a cheap shirt - their image was so integrated with their business that other people wore it as their shirt. And when the brands crashed, these companies didn't even notice - they were branded to the bone. So the real legacy of Marlboro Friday is that it simultaneously brought the two most significant developments in nineties marketing and consumerism into sharp focus: the deeply unhip big-box bargain stores that provide the essentials of life and monopolize a disproportionate share of the market (Wal-Mart et al.) and the extra-premium \"attitude\" brands that provide the essentials of lifestyle and monopolize ever-expanding stretches of cultural space (Nike et al.). The way these two tiers of consumerism developed would have a profound impact on the economy in the years to come. When overall ad expenditures took a nosedive in 1991, Nike and Reebok were busy playing advertising chicken, with each company increasing its budget to outspend the other. In 1991 alone, Reebok upped its ad spending by 71.9 percent, while Nike pumped an extra 24.6 percent into its already soaring ad budget, bringing the company's total spending on marketing to a staggering $250 million annually. Far from worrying about competing on price, the sneaker pimps were designing ever more intricate and pseudoscientific air pockets, and driving up prices by signing star athletes to colossal sponsorship deals. The fetish strategy seemed to be working fine: in the six years prior to 1993, Nike had gone from a $750 million company to a $4 billion one and Phil Knight's Beaverton, Oregon, company emerged from the recession with profits 900 percent higher than when it began. Benetton and Calvin Klein, meanwhile, were also upping their spending on lifestyle marketing, using ads to associate their lines with risqu\u00e9 art and progressive politics. Clothes barely appeared in these high-concept advertisements, let alone prices. Even more abstract was Absolut Vodka, which for some years now had been developing a marketing strategy in which its product disappeared and its brand was nothing but a blank bottle-shaped space that could be filled with whatever content a particular audience most wanted from its brands: intellectual in Harper's, futuristic in Wired, alternative in Spin, loud and proud in Out and \"Absolut Centerfold\" in Playboy. The brand reinvented itself as a cultural sponge, soaking up and morphing to its surroundings. Saturn, too, came out of nowhere in October 1990 when GM launched a car built not out of steel and rubber but out of New Age spirituality and seventies feminism. After the car had been on the market a few years, the company held a \"homecoming\" weekend for Saturn owners, during which they could visit the auto plant and have a cookout with the people who made their cars. As the Saturn ads boasted at the time, \"44,000 people spent their vacations with us, at a car plant.\" It was as if Aunt Jemima had come to life and invited you over to her house for dinner. In 1993, the year the Marlboro Man was temporarily hobbled by \"brand-blind\" consumers, Microsoft made its striking debut on Advertising Age's list of the top 200 ad spenders - the very same year that Apple computer increased its marketing budget by 30 percent after already making branding history with its Orwellian takeoff ad launch during the 1984 Super Bowl. Like Saturn, both companies were selling a hip new relationship to the machine that left Big Blue IBM looking as clunky and menacing as the now-dead Cold War. And then there were the companies that had always understood that they were selling brands before product. Coke, Pepsi, McDonald's, Burger King and Disney weren't fazed by the brand crisis, opting instead to escalate the brand war, especially since they had their eyes firmly fixed on global expansion. They were joined in this project by a wave of sophisticated producer/retailers who hit full stride in the late eighties and early nineties. The Gap, Ikea and the Body Shop were spreading like wildfire during this period, masterfully transforming the generic into the brand-specific, largely through bold, carefully branded packaging and the promotion of an \"experiential\" shopping environment. The Body Shop had been a presence in Britain since the seventies, but it wasn't until 1988 that it began sprouting like a green weed on every street corner in the U.S. Even during the darkest years of the recession, the company opened between forty and fifty American stores a year. Most baffling of all to Wall Street, it pulled off the expansion without spending a dime on advertising. Who needed billboards and magazine ads when retail outlets were three-dimensional advertisements for an ethical and ecological approach to cosmetics? The BodyShop was all brand. The Starbucks coffee chain, meanwhile, was also expanding during this period without laying out much in advertising; instead, it was spinning off its name into a wide range of branded projects: Starbucks airline coffee, office coffee, coffee ice cream, coffee beer. Starbucks seemed to understand brand names at a level even deeper than Madison Avenue, incorporating marketing into every fiber of its corporate concept - from the chain's strategic association with books, blues and jazz to its Euro-latte lingo. What the success of both the Body Shop and Starbucks showed was how far the branding project had come in moving beyond splashing one's logo on a billboard. Here were two companies that had fostered powerful identities by making their brand concept into a virus and sending it out into the culture via a variety of channels: cultural sponsorship, political controversy, the consumer experience and brand extensions. Direct advertising, in this context, was viewed as a rather clumsy intrusion into a much more organic approach to image building. Scott Bedbury, Starbucks' vice president of marketing, openly recognized that \"consumers don't truly believe there's a huge difference between products,\" which is why brands must \"establish emotional ties\" with their customers through \"the Starbucks Experience.\" The people who line up for Starbucks, writes CEO Howard Shultz, aren't just there for the coffee. \"It's the romance of the coffee experience, the feeling of warmth and community people get in Starbucks stores.\" Interestingly, before moving to Starbucks, Bedbury was head of marketing at Nike, where he oversaw the launch of the \"Just Do It!\" slogan, among other watershed branding moments.

An editorial that appeared in Fortune magazine in 1938, for instance, argued that the reason the American economy had yet to recover from the Depression was that America had lost sight of the importance of making things.</p> <p>This is the proposition that the basic and irreversible function of an industrial economy is the making of things; that the more things it makes the bigger will be the income, whether dollar or real; and hence that the key to those lost recuperative powers lies . . . in the factory where the lathes and the drills and the fires and the hammers are. It is in the factory and on the land and under the land that purchasing power originates. And for the longest time, the making of things remained, at least in principle, the heart of all industrialized economies. But by the eighties, pushed along by that decade's recession, some of the most powerful manufacturers in the world had begun to falter. A consensus emerged that corporations were bloated, oversized; they owned too much, employed too many people, and were weighed down with too many things. The very process of producing - running one's own factories, being responsible for tens of thousands of full-time, permanent employees - began to look less like the route to success and more like a clunky liability.</p> <p>At around this same time a new kind of corporation began to rival the traditional all-American manufacturers for market share; these were the Nikes and Microsofts, and later, the Tommy Hilfigers and Intels. These pioneers made the bold claim that producing goods was only an incidental part of their operations, and that thanks to recent victories in trade liberalization and labor-law reform, they were able to have their products made for them by contractors, many of them overseas. What these companies produced primarily were not things, they said, but images of their brands. Their real work lay not in manufacturing but in marketing. This formula, needless to say, has proved enormously profitable, and its success has companies competing in a race toward weightlessness: whoever owns the least, has the fewest employees on the payroll and produces the most powerful images, as opposed to products, wins the race.</p> <p>And so the wave of mergers in the corporate world over the last few years is a deceptive phenomenon: it only looks as if the giants, by joining forces, are getting bigger and bigger.

Their apparent bigness is simply the most effective route toward their real goal: divestment of the world of things.</p> <p>Since many of today's best-known manufacturers no longer produce products and advertise them, but rather buy products and \"brand\" them, these companies are forever on the prowl for creative new ways to build and strengthen their brand images. Manufacturing products may require drills, furnaces, hammers and the like, but creating a brand calls for a completely different set of tools and materials. It requires an endless parade of brand extensions, continuously renewed imagery for marketing and, most of all, fresh new spaces to disseminate the brand's idea of itself. </p> <p>In this section of the book, I'll look at how, in ways both insidious and overt, this corporate obsession with brand identity is waging a war on public and individual space: on public institutions such as schools, on youthful identities, on the concept of nationality and on the possibilities for unmarketed space.</p> <p><strong>The Beginning of the Brand</strong></p> <p>It's helpful to go back briefly and look at where the idea of branding first began. Though the words are often used interchangeably, branding and advertising are not the same process. Advertising any given product is only one part of branding's grand plan, as are sponsorship and logo licensing. Think of the brand as the core meaning of the modern corporation, and of the advertisement as one vehicle used to convey that meaning to the world. The first mass-marketing campaigns, starting in the second half of the nineteenth century, had more to do with advertising than with branding as we understand it today. Faced with a range of recently invented products - the radio, phonograph, car, light bulb and so on - advertisers had more pressing tasks than creating a brand identity for any given corporation; first, they had to change the way people lived their lives. Ads had to inform consumers about the existence of some new invention, then convince them that their lives would be better if they used, for example, cars instead of wagons, telephones instead of mail and electric light instead of oil lamps. Many of these new products bore brand names - some of which are still around today - but these were almost incidental. These products were themselves news; that was almost advertisement enough.</p> <p>The first brand-based products appeared at around the same time as the invention-based ads, largely because of another relatively recent innovation: the factory. When goods began to be produced in factories, not only were entirely new products being introduced but old products - even basic staples - were appearing in strikingly new forms. What made early branding efforts different from more straightforward salesmanship was that the market was now being flooded with uniform mass-produced products that were virtually indistinguishable from one another. Competitive branding became a necessity of the machine age - within a context of manufactured sameness, image-based difference had to be manufactured along with the product.</p> <p>So the role of advertising changed from delivering product news bulletins to building an image around a particular brand-name version of a product. The first task of branding was to bestow proper names on generic goods such as sugar, flour, soap and cereal, which had previously been scooped out of barrels by local shopkeepers. In the 1880s, corporate logos were introduced to mass-produced products like Campbell's Soup, H.J. Heinz pickles and Quaker Oats cereal. As design historians and theorists Ellen Lupton and J. Abbott Miller note, logos were tailored to evoke familiarity and folksiness, in an effort to counteract the new and unsettling anonymity of packaged goods. \"Familiar personalities such as Dr. Brown, Uncle Ben, Aunt Jemima, and Old Grand-Dad came to replace the shop-keeper, who was traditionally responsible for measuring bulk foods for customers and acting as an advocate for products . . . a nationwide vocabulary of brand names replaced the small local shopkeeper as the interface between consumer and product. After the product names and characters had been established, advertising gave them a venue to speak directly to would-be consumers. The corporate \"personality,\" uniquely named, packaged and advertised, had arrived.</p> <p>For the most part, the ad campaigns at the end of the nineteenth century and the start of the twentieth used a set of rigid, pseudoscientific formulas: rivals were never mentioned, ad copy used declarative statements only and headlines had to be large, with lots of white space - according to one turn-of- the-century adman, \"an advertisement should be big enough to make an impression but not any bigger than the thing advertised.\" But there were those in the industry who understood that advertising wasn't just scientific; it was also spiritual. Brands could conjure a feeling - think of Aunt Jemima's comforting presence - but not only that, entire corporations could themselves embody a meaning of their own. In the early twenties, legendary adman Bruce Barton turned General Motors into a metaphor for the American family, \"something personal, warm and human,\" while GE was not so much the name of the faceless General Electric Company as, in Barton's words, \"the initials of a friend.\" In 1923 Barton said that the role of advertising was to help corporations find their soul. The son of a preacher, he drew on his religious upbringing for uplifting messages: \"I like to think of advertising as something big, something splendid, something which goes deep down into an institution and gets hold of the soul of it. . . . Institutions have souls, just as men and nations have souls,\" he told GM president Pierre du Pont. General Motors ads began to tell stories about the people who drove its cars - the preacher, the pharmacist or the country doctor who, thanks to his trusty GM, arrived \"at the bedside of a dying child\" just in time \"to bring it back to life.\"</p> <p>By the end of the 1940s, there was a burgeoning awareness that a brand wasn't just a mascot or a catchphrase or a picture printed on the label of a company's product; the company as a whole could have a brand identity or a \"corporate consciousness,\" as this ephemeral quality was termed at the time. As this idea evolved, the adman ceased to see himself as a pitchman and instead saw himself as \"the philosopher-king of commercial culture,\" in the words of ad critic Randall Rothberg. The search for the true meaning of brands - or the \"brand essence,\" as it is often called - gradually took the agencies away from individual products and their attributes and toward a psychological/anthropological examination of what brands mean to the culture and to people's lives. This was seen to be of crucial importance, since corporations may manufacture products, but what consumers buy are brands.</p> <p>It took several decades for the manufacturing world to adjust to this shift. It clung to the idea that its core business was still production and that branding was an important add-on. Then came the brand equity mania of the eighties, the defining moment of which arrived in 1988 when Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.6 billion - six times what the company was worth on paper. The price difference, apparently, was the cost of the word \"Kraft.\" Of course Wall Street was aware that decades of marketing and brand bolstering added value to a company over and above its assets and total annual sales. But with the Kraft purchase, a huge dollar value had been assigned to something that had previously been abstract and unquantifiable - a brand name. This was spectacular news for the ad world, which was now able to make the claim that advertising spending was more than just a sales strategy: it was an investment in cold hard equity. The more you spend, the more your company is worth. Not surprisingly, this led to a considerable increase in spending on advertising. More important, it sparked a renewed interest in puffing up brand identities, a project that involved far more than a few billboards and TV spots. It was about pushing the envelope in sponsorship deals, dreaming up new areas in which to \"extend\" the brand, as well as perpetually probing the zeitgeist to ensure that the \"essence\" selected for one's brand would resonate karmically with its target market. For reasons that will be explored in the rest of this chapter, this radical shift in corporate philosophy has sent manufacturers on a cultural feeding frenzy as they seize upon every corner of unmarketed landscape in search of the oxygen needed to inflate their brands. In the process, virtually nothing has been left un-branded. That's quite an impressive feat, considering that as recently as 1993 Wall Street had pronounced the brand dead, or as good as dead.</p> <p><strong>The Brand's Death (Rumors of Which Had Been Greatly Exaggerated)</strong></p> <p>The evolution of the brand had one scary episode when it seemed to face extinction. To understand this brush with death, we must first come to terms with advertising's own special law of gravity, which holds that if you aren't rocketing upward you will soon come crashing down. The marketing world is always reaching a new zenith, breaking through last year's world record and planning to do it again next year with increasing numbers of ads and aggressive new formulae for reaching consumers. The advertising industry's astronomical rate of growth is neatly reflected in year-to-year figures measuring total ad spending in the U.S, which have gone up so steadily that by 1998 the figure was set to reach $196.5 billion, while global ad spending is estimated at $435 billion. According to the 1998 United Nations Human Development Report, the growth in global ad spending \"now outpaces the growth of the world economy by one-third.\" This pattern is a by-product of the firmly held belief that brands need continuous and constantly increasing advertising in order to stay in the same place. According to this law of diminishing returns, the more advertising there is out there (and there always is more, because of this law), the more aggressively brands must market to stand out. And of course, no one is more keenly aware of advertising's ubiquity than the advertisers themselves, who view commercial inundation as a clear and persuasive call for more - and more intrusive - advertising. With so much competition, the agencies argue, clients must spend more than ever to make sure their pitch screeches so loud it can be heard over all the others. David Lubars, a senior ad executive in the Omnicom Group, explains the industry's guiding principle with more candor than most. Consumers, he says, \"are like roaches - you spray them and spray them and they get immune after a while.\"</p> <p>So, if consumers are like roaches, then marketers must forever be dreaming up new concoctions for industrial-strength Raid. And nineties marketers, being on a more advanced rung of the sponsorship spiral, have dutifully come up with clever and intrusive new selling techniques to do just that. Recent highlights include these innovations: Gordon's gin experimented with filling British movie theaters with the scent of juniper berries; Calvin Klein stuck \"CK Be\" perfume strips on the backs of Ticketmaster concert envelopes; and in some Scandinavian countries you can get \"free\" long-distance calls with ads cutting into your telephone conversations. And there's plenty more, stretching across ever more expansive surfaces and cramming into the smallest of crevices: sticker ads on pieces of fruit promoting ABC sitcoms, Levi's ads in public washrooms, corporate logos on boxes of Girl Guide cookies, ads for pop albums on takeout food containers, and ads for Batman movies projected on sidewalks or into the night sky. There are already ads on benches in national parks as well as on library cards in public libraries, and in December 1998 NASA announced plans to solicit ads on its space stations. Pepsi's on-going threat to project its logo onto the moon's surface hasn't yet materialized, but Mattel did paint an entire street in Salford, England, \"a shriekingly bright bubblegum hue\" of pink - houses, porches, trees, road, sidewalk, dogs.and cars were all accessories in the televised celebrations of Barbie Pink Month. Barbie is but one small part of the ballooning $30 billion \"experiential communication\" industry, the phrase now used to encompass the staging of such branded pieces of corporate performance art and other \"happenings.\"</p> <p>That we live a sponsored life is now a truism and it's a pretty safe bet that as spending on advertising continues to rise, we roaches will be treated to even more of these ingenious gimmicks, making it ever more difficult and more seemingly pointless to muster even an ounce of outrage. But as mentioned earlier, there was a time when the new frontiers facing the advertising industry weren't looking quite so promising. On April 2, 1993, advertising itself was called into question by the very brands the industry had been building, in some cases, for over two centuries. That day is known in marketing circles as \"Marlboro Friday,\" and it refers to a sudden announcement from Philip Morris that it would slash the price of Marlboro cigarettes by 20 percent in an attempt to compete with bargain brands that were eating into its market. The pundits went nuts, announcing in frenzied unison that not only was Marlboro dead, all brand names were dead. The reasoning was that if a \"prestige\" brand like Marlboro, whose image had been carefully groomed, preened and enhanced with more than a billion advertising dollars, was desperate enough to compete with no-names, then clearly the whole concept of branding had lost its currency. The public had seen the advertising, and the public didn't care. The Marlboro Man, after all, was not any old campaign; launched in 1954, it was the longest-running ad campaign in history. It was a legend. If the Marlboro Man had crashed, well, then, brand equity had crashed as well. The implication that Americans were suddenly thinking for themselves en masse reverberated through Wall Street. The same day Philip Morris announced its price cut, stock prices nose-dived for all the household brands: Heinz, Quaker Oats, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Procter and Gamble and RJR Nabisco. Philip Morris's own stock took the worst beating. Bob Stanojev, national director of consumer products marketing for Ernst and Young, explained the logic behind Wall Street's panic: \"If one or two powerhouse consumer products companies start to cut prices for good, there's going to be an avalanche. Welcome to the value generation.\" Yes, it was one of those moments of overstated instant consensus, but it was not entirely without cause. Marlboro had always sold itself on the strength of its iconic image marketing, not on anything so prosaic as its price. As we now know, the Marlboro Man survived the price wars without sustaining too much damage. At the time, however, Wall Street saw Philip Morris's decision as symbolic of a sea change. The price cut was an admission that Marlboro's name was no longer sufficient to sustain the flagship position, which in a context where image is equity meant that Marlboro had blinked. And when Marlboro - one of the quintessential global brands - blinks, it raises questions about branding that reach beyond Wall Street, and way beyond Philip Morris.</p> <p>The panic of Marlboro Friday was not a reaction to a single incident. Rather, it was the culmination of years of escalating anxiety in the face of some rather dramatic shifts in consumer habits that were seen to be eroding the market share of household-name brands, from Tide to Kraft. Bargain-conscious shoppers, hit hard by the recession, were starting to pay more attention to price than to the prestige bestowed on their products by the yuppie ad campaigns of the 1980s. The public was suffering from a bad case of what is known in the industry as \"brand blindness.\" Study after study showed that baby boomers, blind to the alluring images of advertising and deaf to the empty promises of celebrity spokespersons, were breaking their lifelong brand loyalties and choosing to feed their families with private-label brands from the supermark - claiming, heretically, that they couldn't tell the difference. From the beginning of the recession to 1993, Loblaw's President's Choice line, Wal-Mart's Great Value and Marks and Spencer's St. Michael prepared foods had nearly doubled their market share in North America and Europe. The computer market, meanwhile, was flooded by inexpensive clones, causing IBM to slash its prices and otherwise impale itself. It appeared to be a return to the proverbial shopkeeper dishing out generic goods from the barrel in a prebranded era. The bargain craze of the early nineties shook the name brands to their core. Suddenly it seemed smarter to put resources into price reductions and other incentives than into fabulously expensive ad campaigns. This ambivalence began to be reflected in the amounts companies were willing to pay for so-called brand-enhancing advertising. Then, in 1991, it happened: overall advertising spending actually went down by 5.5 percent for the top 100 brands. It was the first interruption in the steady increase of U.S. ad expenditures since a tiny dip of 0.6 percent in 1970, and the largest drop in four decades. It's not that top corporations weren't flogging their products, it's just that to attract those suddenly fickle customers, many decided to put their money into promotions such as giveaways, contests, in-store displays and (like Marlboro) price reductions. In 1983, American brands spent 70 percent of their total marketing budgets on advertising, and 30 percent on these other forms of promotion. By 1993, the ratio had flipped: only 25 percent went to ads, with the remaining 75 percent going to promotions. Predictably, the ad agencies panicked when they saw their prestige clients abandoning them for the bargain bins and they did what they could to convince big spenders like Procter and Gamble and Philip Morris that the proper route out of the brand crisis wasn't less brand marketing but more. At the annual meeting of the U.S. Association of National Advertisers in 1988, Graham H. Phillips, the U.S. chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, berated the assembled executives for stooping to participate in \"a commodity marketplace\" rather than an image-based one. \"I doubt that many of you would welcome a commodity marketplace in which one competed solely on price, promotion and trade deals, all of which can easily be duplicated by competition, lead-ing to ever-decreasing profits, decay and eventual bankruptcy.\" Others spoke of the importance of maintaining \"conceptual value-added,\" which in effect means adding nothing but marketing. Stooping to compete on the basis of real value, the agencies ominously warned, would spell not just the death of the brand, but corporate death as well.</p> <p>Around the same time as Marlboro Friday, the ad industry felt so under siege that market researcher Jack Myers published Adbashing: Surviving the Attacks on Advertising, a book-length call to arms against everyone from supermarket cashiers handing out coupons for canned peas to legislators contemplating a new tax on ads. \"We, as an industry, must recognize that adbashing is a threat to capitalism, to a free press, to our basic forms of entertainment, and to the future of our children,\" he wrote. Despite these fighting words, most market watchers remained convinced that the heyday of the value-added brand had come and gone. The eighties had gone in for brands and hoity-toity designer labels, reasoned David Scotland, European director of Hiram Walker. The nineties would clearly be all about value. \"A few years ago,\" he observed, \"it might have been considered smart to wear a shirt with a designer's logo embroidered on the pocket; frankly, it now seems a bit naff.\" And from the other side of the Atlantic, Cincinnati journalist Shelly Reese came to the same conclusion about our no-name future, writing that \"Americans with Calvin Klein splashed across their hip pocket aren't pushing grocery carts full of Perrier down the aisles anymore. Instead they're sporting togs with labels like Kmart's Jaclyn Smith and maneuvering carts full of Kroger Co.'s Big K soda. Welcome to the private label decade.\" Scotland and Reese, if they remember their bold pronouncements, are probably feeling just a little bit silly right now. Their embroidered \"pocket\" logos sound positively subdued by today's logomaniacal standards, and sales of name-brand bottled water have been increasing at an annual rate of 9 percent, turning it into a $3.4 billion industry by 1997. From today's logo-quilted perch, it's almost unfathomable that a mere six years ago, death sentences for the brand seemed not only plausible but self-evident. So just how did we get from obituaries for Tide to today's battalions of volunteer billboards for Tommy Hilfiger, Nike and Calvin Klein? Who slipped the steroids into the brand's comeback?</p> <p><strong>The Brands Bounce Back</strong></p> <p>There were some brands that were watching from the sidelines as Wall Street declared the death of the brand. Funny, they must have thought, we don't feel dead. Just as the admen had predicted at the beginning of the recession, the companies that exited the downturn running were the ones who opted for marketing over value every time: Nike, Apple, the Body Shop, Calvin Klein, Disney, Levi's and Starbucks. Not only were these brands doing just fine, thank you very much, but the act of branding was becoming a larger and larger focus of their businesses. For these companies, the ostensible product was mere filler for the real production: the brand. They integrated the idea of branding into the very fabric of their companies. Their corporate cultures were so tight and cloistered that to outsiders they appeared to be a cross between fraternity house, religious cult and sanitarium. Everything was an ad for the brand: bizarre lexicons for describing employees (partners, baristas, team players, crew members), company chants, superstar CEOs, fanatical attention to design consistency, a propensity for monument-building, and New Age mission statements. Unlike classic household brand names, such as Tide and Marlboro, these logos weren't losing their currency, they were in the midst of breaking every barrier in the marketing world - becoming cultural accessories and lifestyle philosophers. These companies didn't wear their image like a cheap shirt - their image was so integrated with their business that other people wore it as their shirt. And when the brands crashed, these companies didn't even notice - they were branded to the bone.</p> <p>So the real legacy of Marlboro Friday is that it simultaneously brought the two most significant developments in nineties marketing and consumerism into sharp focus: the deeply unhip big-box bargain stores that provide the essentials of life and monopolize a disproportionate share of the market (Wal-Mart et al.) and the extra-premium \"attitude\" brands that provide the essentials of lifestyle and monopolize ever-expanding stretches of cultural space (Nike et al.). The way these two tiers of consumerism developed would have a profound impact on the economy in the years to come. When overall ad expenditures took a nosedive in 1991, Nike and Reebok were busy playing advertising chicken, with each company increasing its budget to outspend the other. In 1991 alone, Reebok upped its ad spending by 71.9 percent, while Nike pumped an extra 24.6 percent into its already soaring ad budget, bringing the company's total spending on marketing to a staggering $250 million annually. Far from worrying about competing on price, the sneaker pimps were designing ever more intricate and pseudoscientific air pockets, and driving up prices by signing star athletes to colossal sponsorship deals. The fetish strategy seemed to be working fine: in the six years prior to 1993, Nike had gone from a $750 million company to a $4 billion one and Phil Knight's Beaverton, Oregon, company emerged from the recession with profits 900 percent higher than when it began. Benetton and Calvin Klein, meanwhile, were also upping their spending on lifestyle marketing, using ads to associate their lines with risqu&amp;#233 art and progressive politics. Clothes barely appeared in these high-concept advertisements, let alone prices. Even more abstract was Absolut Vodka, which for some years now had been developing a marketing strategy in which its product disappeared and its brand was nothing but a blank bottle-shaped space that could be filled with whatever content a particular audience most wanted from its brands: intellectual in Harper's, futuristic in Wired, alternative in Spin, loud and proud in Out and \"Absolut Centerfold\" in Playboy. The brand reinvented itself as a cultural sponge, soaking up and morphing to its surroundings.<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,403549,00.html\">Continues</a></p>",

David Ogilvy, founder of the Ogilvy &amp; Mather advertising agency, in Confessions of an Advertising Man, 1963 The astronomical growth in the wealth and cultural influence of multi-national corporations over the last fifteen years can arguably be traced back to a single, seemingly innocuous idea developed by management theorists in the mid-1980s: that successful corporations must primarily produce brands, as opposed to products. Until that time, although it was understood in the corporate world that bolstering one's brand name was important, the primary concern of every solid manufacturer was the production of goods.

In this section of the book, I'll look at how, in ways both insidious and overt, this corporate obsession with brand identity is waging a war on public and individual space: on public institutions such as schools, on youthful identities, on the concept of nationality and on the possibilities for unmarketed space. The Beginning of the Brand It's helpful to go back briefly and look at where the idea of branding first began.

For the most part, the ad campaigns at the end of the nineteenth century and the start of the twentieth used a set of rigid, pseudoscientific formulas: rivals were never mentioned, ad copy used declarative statements only and headlines had to be large, with lots of white space - according to one turn-of- the-century adman, \"an advertisement should be big enough to make an impression but not any bigger than the thing advertised.\" But there were those in the industry who understood that advertising wasn't just scientific; it was also spiritual. Brands could conjure a feeling - think of Aunt Jemima's comforting presence - but not only that, entire corporations could themselves embody a meaning of their own. In the early twenties, legendary adman Bruce Barton turned General Motors into a metaphor for the American family, \"something personal, warm and human,\" while GE was not so much the name of the faceless General Electric Company as, in Barton's words, \"the initials of a friend.\" In 1923 Barton said that the role of advertising was to help corporations find their soul. The son of a preacher, he drew on his religious upbringing for uplifting messages: \"I like to think of advertising as something big, something splendid, something which goes deep down into an institution and gets hold of the soul of it. . . . Institutions have souls, just as men and nations have souls,\" he told GM president Pierre du Pont. General Motors ads began to tell stories about the people who drove its cars - the preacher, the pharmacist or the country doctor who, thanks to his trusty GM, arrived \"at the bedside of a dying child\" just in time \"to bring it back to life.\" By the end of the 1940s, there was a burgeoning awareness that a brand wasn't just a mascot or a catchphrase or a picture printed on the label of a company's product; the company as a whole could have a brand identity or a \"corporate consciousness,\" as this ephemeral quality was termed at the time. As this idea evolved, the adman ceased to see himself as a pitchman and instead saw himself as \"the philosopher-king of commercial culture,\" in the words of ad critic Randall Rothberg. The search for the true meaning of brands - or the \"brand essence,\" as it is often called - gradually took the agencies away from individual products and their attributes and toward a psychological/anthropological examination of what brands mean to the culture and to people's lives. This was seen to be of crucial importance, since corporations may manufacture products, but what consumers buy are brands. It took several decades for the manufacturing world to adjust to this shift. It clung to the idea that its core business was still production and that branding was an important add-on. Then came the brand equity mania of the eighties, the defining moment of which arrived in 1988 when Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.6 billion - six times what the company was worth on paper. The price difference, apparently, was the cost of the word \"Kraft.\" Of course Wall Street was aware that decades of marketing and brand bolstering added value to a company over and above its assets and total annual sales. But with the Kraft purchase, a huge dollar value had been assigned to something that had previously been abstract and unquantifiable - a brand name. This was spectacular news for the ad world, which was now able to make the claim that advertising spending was more than just a sales strategy: it was an investment in cold hard equity. The more you spend, the more your company is worth. Not surprisingly, this led to a considerable increase in spending on advertising. More important, it sparked a renewed interest in puffing up brand identities, a project that involved far more than a few billboards and TV spots. It was about pushing the envelope in sponsorship deals, dreaming up new areas in which to \"extend\" the brand, as well as perpetually probing the zeitgeist to ensure that the \"essence\" selected for one's brand would resonate karmically with its target market. For reasons that will be explored in the rest of this chapter, this radical shift in corporate philosophy has sent manufacturers on a cultural feeding frenzy as they seize upon every corner of unmarketed landscape in search of the oxygen needed to inflate their brands. In the process, virtually nothing has been left un-branded. That's quite an impressive feat, considering that as recently as 1993 Wall Street had pronounced the brand dead, or as good as dead. The Brand's Death (Rumors of Which Had Been Greatly Exaggerated) The evolution of the brand had one scary episode when it seemed to face extinction. To understand this brush with death, we must first come to terms with advertising's own special law of gravity, which holds that if you aren't rocketing upward you will soon come crashing down. The marketing world is always reaching a new zenith, breaking through last year's world record and planning to do it again next year with increasing numbers of ads and aggressive new formulae for reaching consumers. The advertising industry's astronomical rate of growth is neatly reflected in year-to-year figures measuring total ad spending in the U.S, which have gone up so steadily that by 1998 the figure was set to reach $196.5 billion, while global ad spending is estimated at $435 billion. According to the 1998 United Nations Human Development Report, the growth in global ad spending \"now outpaces the growth of the world economy by one-third.\" This pattern is a by-product of the firmly held belief that brands need continuous and constantly increasing advertising in order to stay in the same place. According to this law of diminishing returns, the more advertising there is out there (and there always is more, because of this law), the more aggressively brands must market to stand out. And of course, no one is more keenly aware of advertising's ubiquity than the advertisers themselves, who view commercial inundation as a clear and persuasive call for more - and more intrusive - advertising. With so much competition, the agencies argue, clients must spend more than ever to make sure their pitch screeches so loud it can be heard over all the others. David Lubars, a senior ad executive in the Omnicom Group, explains the industry's guiding principle with more candor than most. Consumers, he says, \"are like roaches - you spray them and spray them and they get immune after a while.\" So, if consumers are like roaches, then marketers must forever be dreaming up new concoctions for industrial-strength Raid. And nineties marketers, being on a more advanced rung of the sponsorship spiral, have dutifully come up with clever and intrusive new selling techniques to do just that. Recent highlights include these innovations: Gordon's gin experimented with filling British movie theaters with the scent of juniper berries; Calvin Klein stuck \"CK Be\" perfume strips on the backs of Ticketmaster concert envelopes; and in some Scandinavian countries you can get \"free\" long-distance calls with ads cutting into your telephone conversations. And there's plenty more, stretching across ever more expansive surfaces and cramming into the smallest of crevices: sticker ads on pieces of fruit promoting ABC sitcoms, Levi's ads in public washrooms, corporate logos on boxes of Girl Guide cookies, ads for pop albums on takeout food containers, and ads for Batman movies projected on sidewalks or into the night sky. There are already ads on benches in national parks as well as on library cards in public libraries, and in December 1998 NASA announced plans to solicit ads on its space stations. Pepsi's on-going threat to project its logo onto the moon's surface hasn't yet materialized, but Mattel did paint an entire street in Salford, England, \"a shriekingly bright bubblegum hue\" of pink - houses, porches, trees, road, sidewalk, dogs.and cars were all accessories in the televised celebrations of Barbie Pink Month. Barbie is but one small part of the ballooning $30 billion \"experiential communication\" industry, the phrase now used to encompass the staging of such branded pieces of corporate performance art and other \"happenings.\" That we live a sponsored life is now a truism and it's a pretty safe bet that as spending on advertising continues to rise, we roaches will be treated to even more of these ingenious gimmicks, making it ever more difficult and more seemingly pointless to muster even an ounce of outrage. But as mentioned earlier, there was a time when the new frontiers facing the advertising industry weren't looking quite so promising. On April 2, 1993, advertising itself was called into question by the very brands the industry had been building, in some cases, for over two centuries. That day is known in marketing circles as \"Marlboro Friday,\" and it refers to a sudden announcement from Philip Morris that it would slash the price of Marlboro cigarettes by 20 percent in an attempt to compete with bargain brands that were eating into its market. The pundits went nuts, announcing in frenzied unison that not only was Marlboro dead, all brand names were dead. The reasoning was that if a \"prestige\" brand like Marlboro, whose image had been carefully groomed, preened and enhanced with more than a billion advertising dollars, was desperate enough to compete with no-names, then clearly the whole concept of branding had lost its currency. The public had seen the advertising, and the public didn't care. The Marlboro Man, after all, was not any old campaign; launched in 1954, it was the longest-running ad campaign in history. It was a legend. If the Marlboro Man had crashed, well, then, brand equity had crashed as well. The implication that Americans were suddenly thinking for themselves en masse reverberated through Wall Street. The same day Philip Morris announced its price cut, stock prices nose-dived for all the household brands: Heinz, Quaker Oats, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Procter and Gamble and RJR Nabisco. Philip Morris's own stock took the worst beating. Bob Stanojev, national director of consumer products marketing for Ernst and Young, explained the logic behind Wall Street's panic: \"If one or two powerhouse consumer products companies start to cut prices for good, there's going to be an avalanche. Welcome to the value generation.\" Yes, it was one of those moments of overstated instant consensus, but it was not entirely without cause. Marlboro had always sold itself on the strength of its iconic image marketing, not on anything so prosaic as its price. As we now know, the Marlboro Man survived the price wars without sustaining too much damage. At the time, however, Wall Street saw Philip Morris's decision as symbolic of a sea change. The price cut was an admission that Marlboro's name was no longer sufficient to sustain the flagship position, which in a context where image is equity meant that Marlboro had blinked. And when Marlboro - one of the quintessential global brands - blinks, it raises questions about branding that reach beyond Wall Street, and way beyond Philip Morris. The panic of Marlboro Friday was not a reaction to a single incident. Rather, it was the culmination of years of escalating anxiety in the face of some rather dramatic shifts in consumer habits that were seen to be eroding the market share of household-name brands, from Tide to Kraft. Bargain-conscious shoppers, hit hard by the recession, were starting to pay more attention to price than to the prestige bestowed on their products by the yuppie ad campaigns of the 1980s. The public was suffering from a bad case of what is known in the industry as \"brand blindness.\" Study after study showed that baby boomers, blind to the alluring images of advertising and deaf to the empty promises of celebrity spokespersons, were breaking their lifelong brand loyalties and choosing to feed their families with private-label brands from the supermark - claiming, heretically, that they couldn't tell the difference. From the beginning of the recession to 1993, Loblaw's President's Choice line, Wal-Mart's Great Value and Marks and Spencer's St. Michael prepared foods had nearly doubled their market share in North America and Europe. The computer market, meanwhile, was flooded by inexpensive clones, causing IBM to slash its prices and otherwise impale itself. It appeared to be a return to the proverbial shopkeeper dishing out generic goods from the barrel in a prebranded era. The bargain craze of the early nineties shook the name brands to their core. Suddenly it seemed smarter to put resources into price reductions and other incentives than into fabulously expensive ad campaigns. This ambivalence began to be reflected in the amounts companies were willing to pay for so-called brand-enhancing advertising. Then, in 1991, it happened: overall advertising spending actually went down by 5.5 percent for the top 100 brands. It was the first interruption in the steady increase of U.S. ad expenditures since a tiny dip of 0.6 percent in 1970, and the largest drop in four decades. It's not that top corporations weren't flogging their products, it's just that to attract those suddenly fickle customers, many decided to put their money into promotions such as giveaways, contests, in-store displays and (like Marlboro) price reductions. In 1983, American brands spent 70 percent of their total marketing budgets on advertising, and 30 percent on these other forms of promotion. By 1993, the ratio had flipped: only 25 percent went to ads, with the remaining 75 percent going to promotions. Predictably, the ad agencies panicked when they saw their prestige clients abandoning them for the bargain bins and they did what they could to convince big spenders like Procter and Gamble and Philip Morris that the proper route out of the brand crisis wasn't less brand marketing but more. At the annual meeting of the U.S. Association of National Advertisers in 1988, Graham H. Phillips, the U.S. chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, berated the assembled executives for stooping to participate in \"a commodity marketplace\" rather than an image-based one. \"I doubt that many of you would welcome a commodity marketplace in which one competed solely on price, promotion and trade deals, all of which can easily be duplicated by competition, lead-ing to ever-decreasing profits, decay and eventual bankruptcy.\" Others spoke of the importance of maintaining \"conceptual value-added,\" which in effect means adding nothing but marketing. Stooping to compete on the basis of real value, the agencies ominously warned, would spell not just the death of the brand, but corporate death as well. Around the same time as Marlboro Friday, the ad industry felt so under siege that market researcher Jack Myers published Adbashing: Surviving the Attacks on Advertising, a book-length call to arms against everyone from supermarket cashiers handing out coupons for canned peas to legislators contemplating a new tax on ads. \"We, as an industry, must recognize that adbashing is a threat to capitalism, to a free press, to our basic forms of entertainment, and to the future of our children,\" he wrote. Despite these fighting words, most market watchers remained convinced that the heyday of the value-added brand had come and gone. The eighties had gone in for brands and hoity-toity designer labels, reasoned David Scotland, European director of Hiram Walker. The nineties would clearly be all about value. \"A few years ago,\" he observed, \"it might have been considered smart to wear a shirt with a designer's logo embroidered on the pocket; frankly, it now seems a bit naff.\" And from the other side of the Atlantic, Cincinnati journalist Shelly Reese came to the same conclusion about our no-name future, writing that \"Americans with Calvin Klein splashed across their hip pocket aren't pushing grocery carts full of Perrier down the aisles anymore. Instead they're sporting togs with labels like Kmart's Jaclyn Smith and maneuvering carts full of Kroger Co.'s Big K soda. Welcome to the private label decade.\" Scotland and Reese, if they remember their bold pronouncements, are probably feeling just a little bit silly right now. Their embroidered \"pocket\" logos sound positively subdued by today's logomaniacal standards, and sales of name-brand bottled water have been increasing at an annual rate of 9 percent, turning it into a $3.4 billion industry by 1997. From today's logo-quilted perch, it's almost unfathomable that a mere six years ago, death sentences for the brand seemed not only plausible but self-evident. So just how did we get from obituaries for Tide to today's battalions of volunteer billboards for Tommy Hilfiger, Nike and Calvin Klein? Who slipped the steroids into the brand's comeback? The Brands Bounce Back There were some brands that were watching from the sidelines as Wall Street declared the death of the brand. Funny, they must have thought, we don't feel dead. Just as the admen had predicted at the beginning of the recession, the companies that exited the downturn running were the ones who opted for marketing over value every time: Nike, Apple, the Body Shop, Calvin Klein, Disney, Levi's and Starbucks. Not only were these brands doing just fine, thank you very much, but the act of branding was becoming a larger and larger focus of their businesses. For these companies, the ostensible product was mere filler for the real production: the brand. They integrated the idea of branding into the very fabric of their companies. Their corporate cultures were so tight and cloistered that to outsiders they appeared to be a cross between fraternity house, religious cult and sanitarium. Everything was an ad for the brand: bizarre lexicons for describing employees (partners, baristas, team players, crew members), company chants, superstar CEOs, fanatical attention to design consistency, a propensity for monument-building, and New Age mission statements. Unlike classic household brand names, such as Tide and Marlboro, these logos weren't losing their currency, they were in the midst of breaking every barrier in the marketing world - becoming cultural accessories and lifestyle philosophers. These companies didn't wear their image like a cheap shirt - their image was so integrated with their business that other people wore it as their shirt. And when the brands crashed, these companies didn't even notice - they were branded to the bone. So the real legacy of Marlboro Friday is that it simultaneously brought the two most significant developments in nineties marketing and consumerism into sharp focus: the deeply unhip big-box bargain stores that provide the essentials of life and monopolize a disproportionate share of the market (Wal-Mart et al.) and the extra-premium \"attitude\" brands that provide the essentials of lifestyle and monopolize ever-expanding stretches of cultural space (Nike et al.). The way these two tiers of consumerism developed would have a profound impact on the economy in the years to come. When overall ad expenditures took a nosedive in 1991, Nike and Reebok were busy playing advertising chicken, with each company increasing its budget to outspend the other. In 1991 alone, Reebok upped its ad spending by 71.9 percent, while Nike pumped an extra 24.6 percent into its already soaring ad budget, bringing the company's total spending on marketing to a staggering $250 million annually. Far from worrying about competing on price, the sneaker pimps were designing ever more intricate and pseudoscientific air pockets, and driving up prices by signing star athletes to colossal sponsorship deals. The fetish strategy seemed to be working fine: in the six years prior to 1993, Nike had gone from a $750 million company to a $4 billion one and Phil Knight's Beaverton, Oregon, company emerged from the recession with profits 900 percent higher than when it began. Benetton and Calvin Klein, meanwhile, were also upping their spending on lifestyle marketing, using ads to associate their lines with risqu\u00e9 art and progressive politics. Clothes barely appeared in these high-concept advertisements, let alone prices. Even more abstract was Absolut Vodka, which for some years now had been developing a marketing strategy in which its product disappeared and its brand was nothing but a blank bottle-shaped space that could be filled with whatever content a particular audience most wanted from its brands: intellectual in Harper's, futuristic in Wired, alternative in Spin, loud and proud in Out and \"Absolut Centerfold\" in Playboy. The brand reinvented itself as a cultural sponge, soaking up and morphing to its surroundings. Continues",

      "bodyText": "Attempts to lower junior doctor's hours have made slow progress since 1991 when the British Medical Association and the government agreed the so-called \"New Deal\" in an attempt to tackle a long-hours culture in which 100-hour weeks were common. But while 100 hour weeks are \"a thing of the past,\" according to the Department of Health, junior doctors working longer than the 56-hour New Deal target are not. Ministers readily admit that \"there are still too many juniors working long and intensive hours.\" The new junior doctor's contract is the latest attempt to solve this thorny problem, which is as much due to the historical shortages of junior doctors, lack of investment and increasing demands on the health service as it is down to poor NHS management. The drive to cut junior's hours have been given fresh urgency by the working time regulations adopted by the European Parliament in May which impose a maximum 48-hour working week on all employees. Under a transitional agreement agreed by the European Union, the NHS has nine years to ensure that all junior doctors meet the 48-hour limit, with an interim target of 58 hours by 2004. Ministers hope that the new penalty system will give trusts an incentive to drive down junior's hours. The penalty amounts to 62% of pay this year, 70% next year and 100% by December 2002. \"The aim of the system is not to pay premium rates for excessive hours but to ensure junior doctors do not exceed 56 hours,\" says a DoH statement. Hospitals that fail to comply with the 56-hour limit could lose their \"accreditation\" - meaning in effect that they will be prevented from appointing new junior doctors until standards are raised. The DoH has also promised to set up regional action teams to help hospitals meet the targets. The teams will have the power to appoint \"troubleshooters\" to deal with specific problems. They will also inspect junior doctors' living conditions and oversee the introduction of new accommodation and catering standards. The teams will consist of two regional directors, three junior doctors, a postgraduate dean, a regional Improving Working Lives champion, a representative from the royal medical colleges, a medical consultant and other experts including trust chief executives. The new junior doctors contract also gives pay increases to junior doctors. New juniors will get an extra \u00a31,700 a year while a senior house officer will get an extra \u00a32,800.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sorcha McKenna asks if we can meet at the courthouse in Monaghan. It's a landmark in the town, a landmark in her life. She lollops over in long easy strides, a huge cardboard envelope clutched to her chest, scarf wrapped round her neck, silky hair waving in the wind. Every inch the confident law student. </p> <p>Last week at this court, in the Republic of Ireland, her father was given a three-year jail sentence for physically and sexually abusing Sorcha. The case was as remarkable as it was sickening. Sorcha waived her right to anonymity so her father could be publicly identified. In court, she detailed the exact nature of the abuse over an eight-year period - from forced oral sex to attempted anal sex. What made Vincent McKenna's abuse even more shocking was the fact that the former IRA arsonist had become a respected human rights activist in Northern Ireland, who had spent the past years condemning punishment beatings. One of his famous stunts was to raise an nail-studded pickaxe handle and ask how there could ever be peace when kids continued to be brutalised with weapons like this. The jury found McKenna guilty of 31 charges of asaulting his daughter. </p> <p>We wander over to a local hotel for sandwiches. She smiles when I ask why she went public. She says she's told so many people, so many times - police, judges, jury, family - that now she almost draws a blank. \"It was because of the influence my father had in the north, and to expose him for what he was really like, and to put him in a position where he wouldn't be able to gain influence or power over anyone again.\" </p> <p>Sorcha says she feels so much older than her years. \"At least 35.\" She's 19 tomorrow. She talks calmly, with eery maturity. It's only when you catch sight of the braces clamped to her teeth that you realise how young, how vulnerable, she actually is. </p> <p>By chance, one of her many aunts passes by. Sorcha calls her over, opens the envelope excitedly, and pulls out her certificate of scholarship for university. Aunt Anne tells her it's worth framing. \"There's only so many from Ireland who get the scholarship: Sorcha's the only one from the county. She's the brains.\" As she leaves, Aunt Anne looks at me. \"Look after her,\" she says. </p> <p>Sorcha was four years old when she was first abused. \"I think it was very unusual because there was a very violent beginning to it. When I was four there was one of the most violent incidents I can remember.\" </p> <p>I ask her for the memory. She says she doesn't want to go into details now that she doesn't have to. \"That's behind me, you know.\" For eight years, she was abused by her father. \"It was a routine more or less, two or three times a week... just something I had to get used to.\" Did anyone in the family know? \"No.\" She talks quietly at the best of times, now she's whispering. </p> <p>Didn't she want to scream out, tell the world what her father was doing to her? \"The thing with that is he threatened to kill me, and he threatened to kill my mother if I told her. Then he said nobody would believe me. His whole presence was so intimidating that I never felt in a position to speak about it.\" </p> <p>I find myself calling McKenna a bastard, and apologise. It is her father, after all. \"I've said worse, trust me, I've said worse. I don't think of him as my father - to me there's a lot more to fatherhood than biology... encouragement and love and support.\" She says she finds it easier to call him McKenna. </p> <p>Throughout her childhood, Sorcha tried to lose herself in school work. \"That was my main means of escape. I got involved in all sorts of extracurricular pursuits like plays and tin-whistle classes.\" She never told her friends what was happening at home. \"I didn't want to be rejected, so I just tried my best to hide it. Some of the people I went to school with would say I was unhappy as child, but they wouldn't have picked up any abuse.\" </p> <p>When Sorcha was nine or 10, and had run out of coping mechanisms, she told her mother, Fiona, a diluted version of the truth. Her mother was devastated, broken. \"She then confronted my father, and he apologised, said it would never happen again. And as far as she was concerned that was the end of it, you know.\" How could he think an apology was enough? \"He said, 'I'll never hurt anyone else again, and there's no reason for you to be afraid of me any more.' \" </p> <p>A few weeks later he was back in her bedroom. Sorcha couldn't bring herself to tell her mother - if her husband didn't destroy her, she thought the grief would. The following year Fiona McKenna threw him out and the couple divorced. McKenna left the Republic of Ireland to study politics in Belfast, and the abuse stopped. Sorcha never allowed herself to be in a situation where he could get to her. The one occasion she slept at his house in a room by herself she kept a knife under her pillow. </p> <p>But, as the judge acknowledged last week, Sorcha was only just beginning to live with her dreadful history. She was 15 when she had a breakdown. \"I think it was post-traumatic stress. I was hysterical, just crying non-stop.\" </p> <p>Sorcha then says something so quickly, almost glibly, that she seems to be brushing it off. \"I think I tried to kill myself or something.\" She cut her wrists with a razor blade. When she didn't pass out, she mopped up the blood and carried on. She never told anyone about the suicide attempt. Was she shocked that she could harm herself? \"No. Numb.\" She says she was numb to everything, everybody. \"I didn't feel alive at all. I thought the pain would wake me up.\" Or kill her? \"I don't know. I'm not sure. I had started with the intention of killing myself. But it wasn't going anywhere, like.\" A lovely big smile shines through her braces. \"I wasn't very successful.\" </p> <p>I ask her whether she still has the scars. She turns her hands to reveal a series of spindly horizontal lines covering her wrist. </p> <p>It was soon after this that she decided to go to the police. \"Child abuse had just been raised in the media, and the thought that he could hurt somebody else just broke me.\" McKenna had two toddlers with a new partner and she was terrified for them. \"The whole thing behind it was that I was going to protect my half brother and half sister, and other children. There was no question about it, it just had to be done.\" By now, McKenna had established the Human Rights Bureau and appointed himself director. He was becoming more respected and high profile by the day, appearing on platforms with the likes of David Trimble and former RUC chief Sir John Hermon. </p> <p>\"I couldn't stand the hypocrisy any more,\" Sorcha says. She told her mother that she was going to the Garda with her allegations against McKenna. Even then she couldn't bring herself to tell her the full story. \"It wasn't something we felt comfortable talking about. Whenever I was giving evidence in court I had everyone removed except my two best friends and the two girls from victim support.\" When she saw her evidence reproduced word for word in a local newspaper she felt sick. </p> <p>It was January 1999 when she first gave a statement to the Garda. McKenna's unbelievable response was to fight for custody of her, but he was barred from seeing her. He claimed he was the victim of an IRA conspiracy to soil his name. \"He said he was just a pawn in the peace process, but you know the IRA have released a statement saying they wouldn't waste a spent bullet on him, never mind good amunition.\" </p> <p>Sorcha was terrified of reprisals. She says she was approached by one of McKenna's sisters on the anniversary of her great granny's death, and shown a photo of a wall near her father's house daubed with \"Vincent McKenna child molester\". She was told she had ruined her father's life with her lies. Her mother's parents recently received a letter bomb in the post. \"We can't say who sent that because we don't know who sent that...\" Sorcha answers mechanically, \"...but we have a fairly good idea who sent it.\" </p> <p>What would have happened if McKenna had been acquitted? \"That would have been the end of it for me.\" Her sentence trails away into nothing. </p> <p>She says the verdict didn't sink in until the next day when she saw the front page of the papers. \"I just went, 'Jesus,' and burst out crying. I think it was relief.\" </p> <p>Sorcha and her mother complained about the lenient sentence, and the fact that McKenna's humanitarian work had counted in his favour. He will be released in three years, maybe less. What then? She says she thinks she's strong enough to cope, though she worries for others. </p> <p>She talks about her wonderful new life at Galway University, what a relief it was that no one knew her when she moved there. When she leaves university she hopes to become a human rights lawyer. </p> <p>I tell her it's amazing how strong, almost buoyant, she seems. She nods, and says she's surprised herself. For the first time in her life Sorcha has started to look forward. She says it's only recently that she discovered her smile. \"I don't have any secrets now. I've nothing to hide anymore.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sorcha McKenna asks if we can meet at the courthouse in Monaghan. It's a landmark in the town, a landmark in her life. She lollops over in long easy strides, a huge cardboard envelope clutched to her chest, scarf wrapped round her neck, silky hair waving in the wind. Every inch the confident law student. Last week at this court, in the Republic of Ireland, her father was given a three-year jail sentence for physically and sexually abusing Sorcha. The case was as remarkable as it was sickening. Sorcha waived her right to anonymity so her father could be publicly identified. In court, she detailed the exact nature of the abuse over an eight-year period - from forced oral sex to attempted anal sex. What made Vincent McKenna's abuse even more shocking was the fact that the former IRA arsonist had become a respected human rights activist in Northern Ireland, who had spent the past years condemning punishment beatings. One of his famous stunts was to raise an nail-studded pickaxe handle and ask how there could ever be peace when kids continued to be brutalised with weapons like this. The jury found McKenna guilty of 31 charges of asaulting his daughter. We wander over to a local hotel for sandwiches. She smiles when I ask why she went public. She says she's told so many people, so many times - police, judges, jury, family - that now she almost draws a blank. \"It was because of the influence my father had in the north, and to expose him for what he was really like, and to put him in a position where he wouldn't be able to gain influence or power over anyone again.\" Sorcha says she feels so much older than her years. \"At least 35.\" She's 19 tomorrow. She talks calmly, with eery maturity. It's only when you catch sight of the braces clamped to her teeth that you realise how young, how vulnerable, she actually is. By chance, one of her many aunts passes by. Sorcha calls her over, opens the envelope excitedly, and pulls out her certificate of scholarship for university. Aunt Anne tells her it's worth framing. \"There's only so many from Ireland who get the scholarship: Sorcha's the only one from the county. She's the brains.\" As she leaves, Aunt Anne looks at me. \"Look after her,\" she says. Sorcha was four years old when she was first abused. \"I think it was very unusual because there was a very violent beginning to it. When I was four there was one of the most violent incidents I can remember.\" I ask her for the memory. She says she doesn't want to go into details now that she doesn't have to. \"That's behind me, you know.\" For eight years, she was abused by her father. \"It was a routine more or less, two or three times a week... just something I had to get used to.\" Did anyone in the family know? \"No.\" She talks quietly at the best of times, now she's whispering. Didn't she want to scream out, tell the world what her father was doing to her? \"The thing with that is he threatened to kill me, and he threatened to kill my mother if I told her. Then he said nobody would believe me. His whole presence was so intimidating that I never felt in a position to speak about it.\" I find myself calling McKenna a bastard, and apologise. It is her father, after all. \"I've said worse, trust me, I've said worse. I don't think of him as my father - to me there's a lot more to fatherhood than biology... encouragement and love and support.\" She says she finds it easier to call him McKenna. Throughout her childhood, Sorcha tried to lose herself in school work. \"That was my main means of escape. I got involved in all sorts of extracurricular pursuits like plays and tin-whistle classes.\" She never told her friends what was happening at home. \"I didn't want to be rejected, so I just tried my best to hide it. Some of the people I went to school with would say I was unhappy as child, but they wouldn't have picked up any abuse.\" When Sorcha was nine or 10, and had run out of coping mechanisms, she told her mother, Fiona, a diluted version of the truth. Her mother was devastated, broken. \"She then confronted my father, and he apologised, said it would never happen again. And as far as she was concerned that was the end of it, you know.\" How could he think an apology was enough? \"He said, 'I'll never hurt anyone else again, and there's no reason for you to be afraid of me any more.' \" A few weeks later he was back in her bedroom. Sorcha couldn't bring herself to tell her mother - if her husband didn't destroy her, she thought the grief would. The following year Fiona McKenna threw him out and the couple divorced. McKenna left the Republic of Ireland to study politics in Belfast, and the abuse stopped. Sorcha never allowed herself to be in a situation where he could get to her. The one occasion she slept at his house in a room by herself she kept a knife under her pillow. But, as the judge acknowledged last week, Sorcha was only just beginning to live with her dreadful history. She was 15 when she had a breakdown. \"I think it was post-traumatic stress. I was hysterical, just crying non-stop.\" Sorcha then says something so quickly, almost glibly, that she seems to be brushing it off. \"I think I tried to kill myself or something.\" She cut her wrists with a razor blade. When she didn't pass out, she mopped up the blood and carried on. She never told anyone about the suicide attempt. Was she shocked that she could harm herself? \"No. Numb.\" She says she was numb to everything, everybody. \"I didn't feel alive at all. I thought the pain would wake me up.\" Or kill her? \"I don't know. I'm not sure. I had started with the intention of killing myself. But it wasn't going anywhere, like.\" A lovely big smile shines through her braces. \"I wasn't very successful.\" I ask her whether she still has the scars. She turns her hands to reveal a series of spindly horizontal lines covering her wrist. It was soon after this that she decided to go to the police. \"Child abuse had just been raised in the media, and the thought that he could hurt somebody else just broke me.\" McKenna had two toddlers with a new partner and she was terrified for them. \"The whole thing behind it was that I was going to protect my half brother and half sister, and other children. There was no question about it, it just had to be done.\" By now, McKenna had established the Human Rights Bureau and appointed himself director. He was becoming more respected and high profile by the day, appearing on platforms with the likes of David Trimble and former RUC chief Sir John Hermon. \"I couldn't stand the hypocrisy any more,\" Sorcha says. She told her mother that she was going to the Garda with her allegations against McKenna. Even then she couldn't bring herself to tell her the full story. \"It wasn't something we felt comfortable talking about. Whenever I was giving evidence in court I had everyone removed except my two best friends and the two girls from victim support.\" When she saw her evidence reproduced word for word in a local newspaper she felt sick. It was January 1999 when she first gave a statement to the Garda. McKenna's unbelievable response was to fight for custody of her, but he was barred from seeing her. He claimed he was the victim of an IRA conspiracy to soil his name. \"He said he was just a pawn in the peace process, but you know the IRA have released a statement saying they wouldn't waste a spent bullet on him, never mind good amunition.\" Sorcha was terrified of reprisals. She says she was approached by one of McKenna's sisters on the anniversary of her great granny's death, and shown a photo of a wall near her father's house daubed with \"Vincent McKenna child molester\". She was told she had ruined her father's life with her lies. Her mother's parents recently received a letter bomb in the post. \"We can't say who sent that because we don't know who sent that...\" Sorcha answers mechanically, \"...but we have a fairly good idea who sent it.\" What would have happened if McKenna had been acquitted? \"That would have been the end of it for me.\" Her sentence trails away into nothing. She says the verdict didn't sink in until the next day when she saw the front page of the papers. \"I just went, 'Jesus,' and burst out crying. I think it was relief.\" Sorcha and her mother complained about the lenient sentence, and the fact that McKenna's humanitarian work had counted in his favour. He will be released in three years, maybe less. What then? She says she thinks she's strong enough to cope, though she worries for others. She talks about her wonderful new life at Galway University, what a relief it was that no one knew her when she moved there. When she leaves university she hopes to become a human rights lawyer. I tell her it's amazing how strong, almost buoyant, she seems. She nods, and says she's surprised herself. For the first time in her life Sorcha has started to look forward. She says it's only recently that she discovered her smile. \"I don't have any secrets now. I've nothing to hide anymore.\"",

I'm not a big fan of betting on draws, as regular readers will know, but a least it's not a multiple. Plenty of time to get it all back and more. Honest. But enough of this frivolity, all padding and not a lot of advice this week I'm afraid. And now I must away, my proper job is calling, devising new and yet more fiendish ways of depriving you hapless punters of your hard-earned cash. And you deserve it frankly, with your optimistic multiples and no-value 'fun bets'. I try to stop you, I warn you at every turning, but will you listen. I hope so. Happy punting. Want to join the Punters Collective? Email the.boss@theguardian.com and tell us why you're going to win.",

These experiences have confirmed that ours is a strong and vibrant nation, full of people whose hearts are bigger than even our most bountiful harvest.

Already, there is some bipartisan groundwork on efforts to reform Social Security and Medicare. We have a duty to find common ground to reform these vital programmes for the greatest generation and for future generations. Republicans and Democrats want a strong military to keep the peace, and a foreign policy that reassures our friends and restrains our enemies. There is growing consensus in Congress and America on the need to reduce taxes by reducing the marriage penalty and eliminating the death tax. And I will work with members of Congress from both parties to reduce tax rates for everyone who pays income taxes in America. Progress on all these issues will require a new tone in Washington. The path to progress is consideration and fair dealing. I have worked with Democrats and Republicans in Texas, and I will do so in Washington.

But now that the votes are counted, it is time for the votes to count.</p> <p>The Vice President's lawyers have indicated he will challenge the certified election results. I respectfully ask him to reconsider. Until Florida's votes were certified, the Vice President was working to represent the interests of those who supported him. I didn't agree with his call for additional recounts, but I respected his decision to fight until the votes were finally certified. Now that they are certified, we enter a different phase. If the Vice President chooses to go forward, he is filing a contest to the outcome of the election, and that is not the best route for America. All of us, in this election, fought for our views. Now we must live up to our principles. We must show our commitment to the common good, which is bigger than any person or any party. We cannot change yesterday, but we share a responsibility for tomorrow. Time runs short and we have a lot of work to do. Tonight, I am naming Secretary Dick Cheney to chair our transition effort, and Andy Card to serve as my chief of staff. I have asked Secretary Cheney to work with President Clinton's administration to open a transition office in Washington, and we look forward to a constructive working relationship throughout this transition. The end of an election is the beginning of a new day. Together, we can make this a positive day of hope and opportunity for all who are blessed to be Americans.

      "body": "<p>The booming complementary health medicines market is to be brought under full regulation by the government following a damning report to be published next week by a parliamentary committee. </p> <p>The 18-month inquiry by the Lords science select committee has left peers shocked at the haphazard standards and lack of even self-regulation. They have also found that the information produced on alternative medicines is of hugely variable quality and sometimes dangerously misleading. </p> <p>Nearly 20% of the population use alternative or complementary medicines, such as acupuncture, reflexology, homeopathic dentistry, or herbal remedies, spending more than \u00a3500m annually in the process. </p> <p>The government is likely to set a timetable for statutory regulation, starting with acupuncture and herbal medicine. The regulation is likely to be brought in on an ad hoc basis using the Health Act passed last year. </p> <p>Only two therapies are at present statutorily regulated - osteopathy and chiropractic - but even they have encountered difficulty bringing all their training bodies into one regulatory authority. </p> <p>Ministers are reluctant to provide alternative remedies on the NHS until there is clearer evidence of their efficacy and proper regulation. There is virtually no serious evidence-based research into their effectiveness, largely because the big pharmaceutical companies are unwilling to fund the research.

      "bodyText": "The booming complementary health medicines market is to be brought under full regulation by the government following a damning report to be published next week by a parliamentary committee. The 18-month inquiry by the Lords science select committee has left peers shocked at the haphazard standards and lack of even self-regulation. They have also found that the information produced on alternative medicines is of hugely variable quality and sometimes dangerously misleading. Nearly 20% of the population use alternative or complementary medicines, such as acupuncture, reflexology, homeopathic dentistry, or herbal remedies, spending more than \u00a3500m annually in the process. The government is likely to set a timetable for statutory regulation, starting with acupuncture and herbal medicine. The regulation is likely to be brought in on an ad hoc basis using the Health Act passed last year. Only two therapies are at present statutorily regulated - osteopathy and chiropractic - but even they have encountered difficulty bringing all their training bodies into one regulatory authority. Ministers are reluctant to provide alternative remedies on the NHS until there is clearer evidence of their efficacy and proper regulation. There is virtually no serious evidence-based research into their effectiveness, largely because the big pharmaceutical companies are unwilling to fund the research. The companies cannot patent the research findings and therefore make a profit. Advocates of alternative medicines have argued that their individualised and holistic approach makes it difficult to carry out traditional scientific research, but the committee is expected to reject this claim. It will call on the government to make research a priority and suggest the industry has a responsibility to fund research. The committee was told that some therapies had as many as 12 different associations making it possible for a therapist, struck off for incompetence from one voluntary register, to carry on practising by joining another. The only sanction is criminal law. Yvette Cooper, the minister for public health, who has used complementary medicines to combat ME, told the committee that she was disturbed by the lack of proper regulation in the field. Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, told the committee: \"It is important, as the complementary professions form themselves into recognisable professional bodies, that they are also brought into a statutory framework.\" He said the move would ensure only professional and trained practitioners could practise. They could also be formally trained on the limits of alternative medicines, and the need to cooperate with orthodox medicine. The committee will warn that some invasive techniques, such as the use of acupuncture needles, need to be closely overseen. It will also warn that such treatments can be dangerous if they are seen as an alternative to conventional medicine, so leading patients to be deprived of the necessary orthodox medicines.

      "bodyText": "Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness came under attack at the Bloody Sunday inquiry today for not having the \"courage, integrity or respect\" to co-operate with the new investigation into the killings. A lawyer representing most of the soldiers who were on duty in Londonderry that day said it was \"galling\" to see the leading republican, now Mid Ulster MP and the Northern Ireland education minister, attending the opening of the inquiry's public hearings earlier this year. Mr Edwin Glasgow QC, also acknowledged that innocent people were killed on January 30 1972, and told the tribunal he would not argue that any of the known dead and injured were armed with guns, nail bombs, petrol bombs or acid bombs. However, up to 34 other people were also shot dead or seriously injured in the military operation 28 years ago - casualties he said were never publicly acknowledged and who probably included the gunmen and bombers attacking the soldiers. Mr Glasgow's comments came as he made his opening submissions on behalf of 440 soldiers, who ranged from teenage recruits on the ground to high-ranking officers, on the day 13 men were shot dead during a raid by Paratroopers on Derry's Bogside district during a civil rights demonstration. Mr Glasgow also hit back at complaints by lawyers for the victims about non-disclosure of evidence by political and military authorities of the day. He said the process of handing information to the inquiry had so far been \"wholly and exceptionally\" one-sided, with no statements from the leading republicans of that era, including Mr McGuinness. Mr McGuinness responded later saying: \"I will treat the comments of Mr Glasgow with the contempt they deserve.\" He claimed Mr Glasgow's words were an obvious attempt to deflect attention away from the weight of evidence that continued to be presented indicting the soldiers who opened fire on Bloody Sunday and the military and political authorities. The inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville of Newdigate, was established in 1998 and has been sitting in public at the Guildhall, Derry, since March this year. It has so far been concerned almost entirely with opening presentations, and is only to start hearing live testimonies from witnesses tomorrow, its 52nd day of oral hearings. Mr Glasgow spoke today about the opening remarks of the counsel to the inquiry by Mr Christopher Clarke QC, who had said evidence had been sought in all continents of the globe, save Antarctica. Mr Glasgow went on: \"I have to say it was pretty galling to see that statement witnessed by Mr Martin McGuinness, who so far as we know does not live in Antarctica and who, despite the obvious importance of the matters which Mr Clarke had objectively laid out in his careful explanation, that witness, despite the relevance and importance of those matters, has neither the courage nor the integrity nor the respect for this tribunal to co-operate with this inquiry, which he personally pressed for and which he was at pains to be seen in company with the Tribunal on the very day that it opened.\" Earlier this year intelligence documents were presented to the inquiry which alleged that Mr McGuinness fired the shot which precipitated Bloody Sunday - a claim denied outside the hearing by Mr McGuinness. Mr McGuinness said in his statement issued later today that he had already had a number of meetings with his solicitor to determine the most adequate way of presenting his evidence. He added: \"When that is decided I will inform the families.\" The tribunal and the media would then be notified, he added Mr Glasgow referred to claims by Mr McGuinness that leading republicans had given assurances before the ill-fated march that there would be no republican presence there. The QC maintained that the soldiers he represented who opened fire \"aimed at, shot at, only those who they believed to be using firearms or those threatening lethal violence against themselves or others\". He spoke of 40 people believed by the inquiry to be members of or connected with the IRA in the city at the time of the catastrophe, to whom the tribunal had written more than a year ago. The \"vast majority\", apart from \"honourable exceptions\", had not replied, he said. He said: \"I have to say that it would have been good to hear that we had support from everyone in this room, or even from someone in this room in expressing the hope that you (the tribunal) would be told by those who are actually in a position to tell you openly and truthfully what both wings of the IRA were doing on Bloody Sunday.\" Mr Glasgow's position in not pursuing allegations of wrongdoing by the 13 known dead and 14 known injured flies in the face of the findings of 1972 inquiry into the shootings in which the then lord chancellor Lord Widgery concluded there was \"strong evidence\" that some had been firing weapons or handling bombs. However Mr Glasgow's stance was at odds with a second legal team representing other military witnesses, which persisted in linking two identified casualties - Gerald Donaghey, who was killed, and the wounded Joseph Friel - with weaponry allegedly used on the day.

Trusts whose junior doctors work more than 56 hours a week limit will be forced under new rules that come into force on 1 December to pay them substantial \"overtime\" penalties of nearly two thirds of salary. The Department of Health's figures show that 229 trusts will have juniors working more hours than the weekly limit when the arrangement comes into force as part of the new junior doctor's contract. There are 30,300 junior doctors working in the NHS. They earn between \u00a326,000 and \u00a352,000. DoH figures suggest 11,600 of them will qualify for the extra payments. The penalties were described by ministers as a \"sharp financial incentive for all trusts to ensure junior doctors do not have to work excessive hours\". But it is likely that trusts will feel that they are being punished for circumstances beyond their control - a general shortage of junior doctors, coupled with ever-increasing public demands on the NHS hospital system. Alastair Henderson, policy manager at the NHS Confederation, said that although the penalties might persuade trusts to improve junior doctors' hours it would also \"impose financial difficulties\" on some of them. Paul Thorpe, deputy chair of the British Medical Association's junior doctors committee said that the government figures underestimated the number of juniors working more than 56 hours a week. DoH figures show that numbers of junior doctors working more than recommended maximum has risen over the last six months, providing further evidence of the strain on the NHS.

      "bodyText": "Israel's parliament, the Knesset, holds the fate of the Middle East peace process in its hands. Tomorrow morning, a vote takes place which could unseat the fractious minority government of the prime minister, Ehud Barak, and open the door to a new rightwing administration, which looks bent on a military solution to the Palestinian uprising. Events are conspiring against Mr Barak and the dwindling band of Israelis who believe the peace process can be revived. Five more Palestinians were killed this morning. They were shot by Israeli soldiers manning a checkpoint in the occupied West Bank. Palestinian Muslims began observing the holy month of Ramadan this morning. Militants have warned that if Israeli forces prevent worshippers from reaching mosques and other sacred sites, there will be serious confrontations. Likud, the main rightwing bloc in the 120-seat Knesset, is claiming that it has mustered the 61 votes it needs to bring down the government in tomorrow's vote. The United States has taken a back seat in the negotiations due to the impasse in the presidential race. The only small spark of hope is that security force chiefs have reportedly renewed contact, in the hope of reopening lines of communication and liaison. The head of Shin Bet, Israel's internal secret service, met the Palestinian intelligence chief, Mohammed Dahlan, in Cairo. However, that could be too little, too late. In both Israel and the Palestinian territories, tempers are inflamed and politics dominated by talk of war and revenge. Mr Barak is trailing badly in the polls, and has little chance of winning a general election, should Likud win tomorrow's vote. For weeks, the prime minister has been trying to defuse the political crisis by recruiting Likud ministers to a new government of national unity. But the leader of Likud, Ariel Sharon, who is Israel's most notorious hawk, put too high a price on unity. He held out for more draconian military measures against Palestinian rioters and, in effect, demanded that the peace process itself be unravelled. Mr Sharon has long championed a more aggressive Israeli approach and strongly supports more colonisation of the West Bank, where about 170,000 Jewish settlers live in fortified cantonments among 2m Palestinians. The Likud leader was the main author of Israel's disastrous invasion of Lebanon in 1982, which led to the 18-year occupation of the south of that country. Israeli troops were finally pulled out of the occupation zone earlier this year. Hizbullah guerrillas based in the territory are stepping up operations and killed an Israeli soldier on Sunday.This has further raised the emotional and political temperature in a region braced for war.

      "bodyText": "The owners of Wembley Stadium have hired brand consultancy Identica to create a fresh identity for the venue when it opens in 2004. Wembley chiefs are ploughing \u00a3500m into a new 90,000-seat state-of-the-art stadium to be called the English National Stadium. Identica, which has been responsible for the images of Powergen, Universal Studios and Alliance and Leicester, is being hired to ensure the new venue gets a positive image from the start. The stadium plans to attract 2.7m visitors a year - 1.7m from major events and a further 1m from smaller attractions. But sceptics say these projections are over-ambitious and could create a repetition of the Dome fiasco, with the government forced to bail it out if it hits financial problems. The stadium is being designed by Lord Foster's Foster &amp; Partners. Identica's task will be to create a new brand for the stadium. Wembley Stadium had become shabby and outdated by the time it closed last month and the English National Stadium will have to ensure it distances itself from its previous incarnation. The new identity is likely to be based on a 133m arch, which replaces the famous Wembley twin towers.",

Both the FT and CBS, the US television network, own significant stakes in Marketwatch, although the transatlantic ventures are managed separately. Other partnerships, notably that between the Washington Post and MSNBC.com, are sharing editorial rather than financial resources. The situation is fluid, with many media companies still toying with the go-it-alone versus the alliance route in the US. Larry Kramer, the chief executive of Marketwatch.com, says: \"Everybody is trying to figure out how to get to where they want to be and how best to manage their business in a changing climate.\" For the New York Times, where they want to be for now is left alone to their own considerable resources.",

It requires an endless parade of brand extensions, continuously renewed imagery for marketing and, most of all, fresh new spaces to disseminate the brand's idea of itself. </p> <p>In this section of the book, I'll look at how, in ways both insidious and overt, this corporate obsession with brand identity is waging a war on public and individual space: on public institutions such as schools, on youthful identities, on the concept of nationality and on the possibilities for unmarketed space.</p> <p><strong>The Beginning of the Brand</strong></p> <p>It's helpful to go back briefly and look at where the idea of branding first began. Though the words are often used interchangeably, branding and advertising are not the same process. Advertising any given product is only one part of branding's grand plan, as are sponsorship and logo licensing. Think of the brand as the core meaning of the modern corporation, and of the advertisement as one vehicle used to convey that meaning to the world. The first mass-marketing campaigns, starting in the second half of the nineteenth century, had more to do with advertising than with branding as we understand it today. Faced with a range of recently invented products - the radio, phonograph, car, light bulb and so on - advertisers had more pressing tasks than creating a brand identity for any given corporation; first, they had to change the way people lived their lives. Ads had to inform consumers about the existence of some new invention, then convince them that their lives would be better if they used, for example, cars instead of wagons, telephones instead of mail and electric light instead of oil lamps. Many of these new products bore brand names - some of which are still around today - but these were almost incidental. These products were themselves news; that was almost advertisement enough.</p> <p>The first brand-based products appeared at around the same time as the invention-based ads, largely because of another relatively recent innovation: the factory. When goods began to be produced in factories, not only were entirely new products being introduced but old products - even basic staples - were appearing in strikingly new forms. What made early branding efforts different from more straightforward salesmanship was that the market was now being flooded with uniform mass-produced products that were virtually indistinguishable from one another. Competitive branding became a necessity of the machine age - within a context of manufactured sameness, image-based difference had to be manufactured along with the product.</p> <p>So the role of advertising changed from delivering product news bulletins to building an image around a particular brand-name version of a product. The first task of branding was to bestow proper names on generic goods such as sugar, flour, soap and cereal, which had previously been scooped out of barrels by local shopkeepers. In the 1880s, corporate logos were introduced to mass-produced products like Campbell's Soup, H.J. Heinz pickles and Quaker Oats cereal. As design historians and theorists Ellen Lupton and J. Abbott Miller note, logos were tailored to evoke familiarity and folksiness, in an effort to counteract the new and unsettling anonymity of packaged goods. \"Familiar personalities such as Dr. Brown, Uncle Ben, Aunt Jemima, and Old Grand-Dad came to replace the shop-keeper, who was traditionally responsible for measuring bulk foods for customers and acting as an advocate for products . . . a nationwide vocabulary of brand names replaced the small local shopkeeper as the interface between consumer and product. After the product names and characters had been established, advertising gave them a venue to speak directly to would-be consumers. The corporate \"personality,\" uniquely named, packaged and advertised, had arrived.</p> <p>For the most part, the ad campaigns at the end of the nineteenth century and the start of the twentieth used a set of rigid, pseudoscientific formulas: rivals were never mentioned, ad copy used declarative statements only and headlines had to be large, with lots of white space - according to one turn-of- the-century adman, \"an advertisement should be big enough to make an impression but not any bigger than the thing advertised.\" But there were those in the industry who understood that advertising wasn't just scientific; it was also spiritual. Brands could conjure a feeling - think of Aunt Jemima's comforting presence - but not only that, entire corporations could themselves embody a meaning of their own. In the early twenties, legendary adman Bruce Barton turned General Motors into a metaphor for the American family, \"something personal, warm and human,\" while GE was not so much the name of the faceless General Electric Company as, in Barton's words, \"the initials of a friend.\" In 1923 Barton said that the role of advertising was to help corporations find their soul. The son of a preacher, he drew on his religious upbringing for uplifting messages: \"I like to think of advertising as something big, something splendid, something which goes deep down into an institution and gets hold of the soul of it. . . . Institutions have souls, just as men and nations have souls,\" he told GM president Pierre du Pont. General Motors ads began to tell stories about the people who drove its cars - the preacher, the pharmacist or the country doctor who, thanks to his trusty GM, arrived \"at the bedside of a dying child\" just in time \"to bring it back to life.\"</p> <p>By the end of the 1940s, there was a burgeoning awareness that a brand wasn't just a mascot or a catchphrase or a picture printed on the label of a company's product; the company as a whole could have a brand identity or a \"corporate consciousness,\" as this ephemeral quality was termed at the time. As this idea evolved, the adman ceased to see himself as a pitchman and instead saw himself as \"the philosopher-king of commercial culture,\" in the words of ad critic Randall Rothberg. The search for the true meaning of brands - or the \"brand essence,\" as it is often called - gradually took the agencies away from individual products and their attributes and toward a psychological/anthropological examination of what brands mean to the culture and to people's lives. This was seen to be of crucial importance, since corporations may manufacture products, but what consumers buy are brands.</p> <p>It took several decades for the manufacturing world to adjust to this shift. It clung to the idea that its core business was still production and that branding was an important add-on. Then came the brand equity mania of the eighties, the defining moment of which arrived in 1988 when Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.6 billion - six times what the company was worth on paper. The price difference, apparently, was the cost of the word \"Kraft.\" Of course Wall Street was aware that decades of marketing and brand bolstering added value to a company over and above its assets and total annual sales. But with the Kraft purchase, a huge dollar value had been assigned to something that had previously been abstract and unquantifiable - a brand name. This was spectacular news for the ad world, which was now able to make the claim that advertising spending was more than just a sales strategy: it was an investment in cold hard equity. The more you spend, the more your company is worth. Not surprisingly, this led to a considerable increase in spending on advertising. More important, it sparked a renewed interest in puffing up brand identities, a project that involved far more than a few billboards and TV spots. It was about pushing the envelope in sponsorship deals, dreaming up new areas in which to \"extend\" the brand, as well as perpetually probing the zeitgeist to ensure that the \"essence\" selected for one's brand would resonate karmically with its target market. For reasons that will be explored in the rest of this chapter, this radical shift in corporate philosophy has sent manufacturers on a cultural feeding frenzy as they seize upon every corner of unmarketed landscape in search of the oxygen needed to inflate their brands. In the process, virtually nothing has been left un-branded. That's quite an impressive feat, considering that as recently as 1993 Wall Street had pronounced the brand dead, or as good as dead.</p> <p><strong>The Brand's Death (Rumors of Which Had Been Greatly Exaggerated)</strong></p> <p>The evolution of the brand had one scary episode when it seemed to face extinction. To understand this brush with death, we must first come to terms with advertising's own special law of gravity, which holds that if you aren't rocketing upward you will soon come crashing down. The marketing world is always reaching a new zenith, breaking through last year's world record and planning to do it again next year with increasing numbers of ads and aggressive new formulae for reaching consumers. The advertising industry's astronomical rate of growth is neatly reflected in year-to-year figures measuring total ad spending in the U.S, which have gone up so steadily that by 1998 the figure was set to reach $196.5 billion, while global ad spending is estimated at $435 billion. According to the 1998 United Nations Human Development Report, the growth in global ad spending \"now outpaces the growth of the world economy by one-third.\" This pattern is a by-product of the firmly held belief that brands need continuous and constantly increasing advertising in order to stay in the same place. According to this law of diminishing returns, the more advertising there is out there (and there always is more, because of this law), the more aggressively brands must market to stand out. And of course, no one is more keenly aware of advertising's ubiquity than the advertisers themselves, who view commercial inundation as a clear and persuasive call for more - and more intrusive - advertising. With so much competition, the agencies argue, clients must spend more than ever to make sure their pitch screeches so loud it can be heard over all the others. David Lubars, a senior ad executive in the Omnicom Group, explains the industry's guiding principle with more candor than most. Consumers, he says, \"are like roaches - you spray them and spray them and they get immune after a while.\"</p> <p>So, if consumers are like roaches, then marketers must forever be dreaming up new concoctions for industrial-strength Raid. And nineties marketers, being on a more advanced rung of the sponsorship spiral, have dutifully come up with clever and intrusive new selling techniques to do just that. Recent highlights include these innovations: Gordon's gin experimented with filling British movie theaters with the scent of juniper berries; Calvin Klein stuck \"CK Be\" perfume strips on the backs of Ticketmaster concert envelopes; and in some Scandinavian countries you can get \"free\" long-distance calls with ads cutting into your telephone conversations. And there's plenty more, stretching across ever more expansive surfaces and cramming into the smallest of crevices: sticker ads on pieces of fruit promoting ABC sitcoms, Levi's ads in public washrooms, corporate logos on boxes of Girl Guide cookies, ads for pop albums on takeout food containers, and ads for Batman movies projected on sidewalks or into the night sky. There are already ads on benches in national parks as well as on library cards in public libraries, and in December 1998 NASA announced plans to solicit ads on its space stations. Pepsi's on-going threat to project its logo onto the moon's surface hasn't yet materialized, but Mattel did paint an entire street in Salford, England, \"a shriekingly bright bubblegum hue\" of pink - houses, porches, trees, road, sidewalk, dogs.and cars were all accessories in the televised celebrations of Barbie Pink Month. Barbie is but one small part of the ballooning $30 billion \"experiential communication\" industry, the phrase now used to encompass the staging of such branded pieces of corporate performance art and other \"happenings.\"</p> <p>That we live a sponsored life is now a truism and it's a pretty safe bet that as spending on advertising continues to rise, we roaches will be treated to even more of these ingenious gimmicks, making it ever more difficult and more seemingly pointless to muster even an ounce of outrage. But as mentioned earlier, there was a time when the new frontiers facing the advertising industry weren't looking quite so promising. On April 2, 1993, advertising itself was called into question by the very brands the industry had been building, in some cases, for over two centuries. That day is known in marketing circles as \"Marlboro Friday,\" and it refers to a sudden announcement from Philip Morris that it would slash the price of Marlboro cigarettes by 20 percent in an attempt to compete with bargain brands that were eating into its market. The pundits went nuts, announcing in frenzied unison that not only was Marlboro dead, all brand names were dead. The reasoning was that if a \"prestige\" brand like Marlboro, whose image had been carefully groomed, preened and enhanced with more than a billion advertising dollars, was desperate enough to compete with no-names, then clearly the whole concept of branding had lost its currency. The public had seen the advertising, and the public didn't care. The Marlboro Man, after all, was not any old campaign; launched in 1954, it was the longest-running ad campaign in history. It was a legend. If the Marlboro Man had crashed, well, then, brand equity had crashed as well. The implication that Americans were suddenly thinking for themselves en masse reverberated through Wall Street. The same day Philip Morris announced its price cut, stock prices nose-dived for all the household brands: Heinz, Quaker Oats, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Procter and Gamble and RJR Nabisco. Philip Morris's own stock took the worst beating. Bob Stanojev, national director of consumer products marketing for Ernst and Young, explained the logic behind Wall Street's panic: \"If one or two powerhouse consumer products companies start to cut prices for good, there's going to be an avalanche. Welcome to the value generation.\" Yes, it was one of those moments of overstated instant consensus, but it was not entirely without cause. Marlboro had always sold itself on the strength of its iconic image marketing, not on anything so prosaic as its price. As we now know, the Marlboro Man survived the price wars without sustaining too much damage. At the time, however, Wall Street saw Philip Morris's decision as symbolic of a sea change. The price cut was an admission that Marlboro's name was no longer sufficient to sustain the flagship position, which in a context where image is equity meant that Marlboro had blinked. And when Marlboro - one of the quintessential global brands - blinks, it raises questions about branding that reach beyond Wall Street, and way beyond Philip Morris.</p> <p>The panic of Marlboro Friday was not a reaction to a single incident. Rather, it was the culmination of years of escalating anxiety in the face of some rather dramatic shifts in consumer habits that were seen to be eroding the market share of household-name brands, from Tide to Kraft. Bargain-conscious shoppers, hit hard by the recession, were starting to pay more attention to price than to the prestige bestowed on their products by the yuppie ad campaigns of the 1980s. The public was suffering from a bad case of what is known in the industry as \"brand blindness.\" Study after study showed that baby boomers, blind to the alluring images of advertising and deaf to the empty promises of celebrity spokespersons, were breaking their lifelong brand loyalties and choosing to feed their families with private-label brands from the supermark - claiming, heretically, that they couldn't tell the difference. From the beginning of the recession to 1993, Loblaw's President's Choice line, Wal-Mart's Great Value and Marks and Spencer's St. Michael prepared foods had nearly doubled their market share in North America and Europe. The computer market, meanwhile, was flooded by inexpensive clones, causing IBM to slash its prices and otherwise impale itself. It appeared to be a return to the proverbial shopkeeper dishing out generic goods from the barrel in a prebranded era. The bargain craze of the early nineties shook the name brands to their core. Suddenly it seemed smarter to put resources into price reductions and other incentives than into fabulously expensive ad campaigns. This ambivalence began to be reflected in the amounts companies were willing to pay for so-called brand-enhancing advertising. Then, in 1991, it happened: overall advertising spending actually went down by 5.5 percent for the top 100 brands. It was the first interruption in the steady increase of U.S. ad expenditures since a tiny dip of 0.6 percent in 1970, and the largest drop in four decades. It's not that top corporations weren't flogging their products, it's just that to attract those suddenly fickle customers, many decided to put their money into promotions such as giveaways, contests, in-store displays and (like Marlboro) price reductions. In 1983, American brands spent 70 percent of their total marketing budgets on advertising, and 30 percent on these other forms of promotion. By 1993, the ratio had flipped: only 25 percent went to ads, with the remaining 75 percent going to promotions. Predictably, the ad agencies panicked when they saw their prestige clients abandoning them for the bargain bins and they did what they could to convince big spenders like Procter and Gamble and Philip Morris that the proper route out of the brand crisis wasn't less brand marketing but more. At the annual meeting of the U.S. Association of National Advertisers in 1988, Graham H. Phillips, the U.S. chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, berated the assembled executives for stooping to participate in \"a commodity marketplace\" rather than an image-based one. \"I doubt that many of you would welcome a commodity marketplace in which one competed solely on price, promotion and trade deals, all of which can easily be duplicated by competition, lead-ing to ever-decreasing profits, decay and eventual bankruptcy.\" Others spoke of the importance of maintaining \"conceptual value-added,\" which in effect means adding nothing but marketing. Stooping to compete on the basis of real value, the agencies ominously warned, would spell not just the death of the brand, but corporate death as well.</p> <p>Around the same time as Marlboro Friday, the ad industry felt so under siege that market researcher Jack Myers published Adbashing: Surviving the Attacks on Advertising, a book-length call to arms against everyone from supermarket cashiers handing out coupons for canned peas to legislators contemplating a new tax on ads. \"We, as an industry, must recognize that adbashing is a threat to capitalism, to a free press, to our basic forms of entertainment, and to the future of our children,\" he wrote. Despite these fighting words, most market watchers remained convinced that the heyday of the value-added brand had come and gone. The eighties had gone in for brands and hoity-toity designer labels, reasoned David Scotland, European director of Hiram Walker. The nineties would clearly be all about value. \"A few years ago,\" he observed, \"it might have been considered smart to wear a shirt with a designer's logo embroidered on the pocket; frankly, it now seems a bit naff.\" And from the other side of the Atlantic, Cincinnati journalist Shelly Reese came to the same conclusion about our no-name future, writing that \"Americans with Calvin Klein splashed across their hip pocket aren't pushing grocery carts full of Perrier down the aisles anymore. Instead they're sporting togs with labels like Kmart's Jaclyn Smith and maneuvering carts full of Kroger Co.'s Big K soda. Welcome to the private label decade.\" Scotland and Reese, if they remember their bold pronouncements, are probably feeling just a little bit silly right now. Their embroidered \"pocket\" logos sound positively subdued by today's logomaniacal standards, and sales of name-brand bottled water have been increasing at an annual rate of 9 percent, turning it into a $3.4 billion industry by 1997. From today's logo-quilted perch, it's almost unfathomable that a mere six years ago, death sentences for the brand seemed not only plausible but self-evident. So just how did we get from obituaries for Tide to today's battalions of volunteer billboards for Tommy Hilfiger, Nike and Calvin Klein? Who slipped the steroids into the brand's comeback?</p> <p><strong>The Brands Bounce Back</strong></p> <p>There were some brands that were watching from the sidelines as Wall Street declared the death of the brand. Funny, they must have thought, we don't feel dead. Just as the admen had predicted at the beginning of the recession, the companies that exited the downturn running were the ones who opted for marketing over value every time: Nike, Apple, the Body Shop, Calvin Klein, Disney, Levi's and Starbucks. Not only were these brands doing just fine, thank you very much, but the act of branding was becoming a larger and larger focus of their businesses. For these companies, the ostensible product was mere filler for the real production: the brand. They integrated the idea of branding into the very fabric of their companies. Their corporate cultures were so tight and cloistered that to outsiders they appeared to be a cross between fraternity house, religious cult and sanitarium. Everything was an ad for the brand: bizarre lexicons for describing employees (partners, baristas, team players, crew members), company chants, superstar CEOs, fanatical attention to design consistency, a propensity for monument-building, and New Age mission statements. Unlike classic household brand names, such as Tide and Marlboro, these logos weren't losing their currency, they were in the midst of breaking every barrier in the marketing world - becoming cultural accessories and lifestyle philosophers. These companies didn't wear their image like a cheap shirt - their image was so integrated with their business that other people wore it as their shirt. And when the brands crashed, these companies didn't even notice - they were branded to the bone.</p> <p>So the real legacy of Marlboro Friday is that it simultaneously brought the two most significant developments in nineties marketing and consumerism into sharp focus: the deeply unhip big-box bargain stores that provide the essentials of life and monopolize a disproportionate share of the market (Wal-Mart et al.) and the extra-premium \"attitude\" brands that provide the essentials of lifestyle and monopolize ever-expanding stretches of cultural space (Nike et al.). The way these two tiers of consumerism developed would have a profound impact on the economy in the years to come. When overall ad expenditures took a nosedive in 1991, Nike and Reebok were busy playing advertising chicken, with each company increasing its budget to outspend the other. In 1991 alone, Reebok upped its ad spending by 71.9 percent, while Nike pumped an extra 24.6 percent into its already soaring ad budget, bringing the company's total spending on marketing to a staggering $250 million annually. Far from worrying about competing on price, the sneaker pimps were designing ever more intricate and pseudoscientific air pockets, and driving up prices by signing star athletes to colossal sponsorship deals. The fetish strategy seemed to be working fine: in the six years prior to 1993, Nike had gone from a $750 million company to a $4 billion one and Phil Knight's Beaverton, Oregon, company emerged from the recession with profits 900 percent higher than when it began. Benetton and Calvin Klein, meanwhile, were also upping their spending on lifestyle marketing, using ads to associate their lines with risqu&amp;#233 art and progressive politics. Clothes barely appeared in these high-concept advertisements, let alone prices. Even more abstract was Absolut Vodka, which for some years now had been developing a marketing strategy in which its product disappeared and its brand was nothing but a blank bottle-shaped space that could be filled with whatever content a particular audience most wanted from its brands: intellectual in Harper's, futuristic in Wired, alternative in Spin, loud and proud in Out and \"Absolut Centerfold\" in Playboy. The brand reinvented itself as a cultural sponge, soaking up and morphing to its surroundings.</p>",

Though the words are often used interchangeably, branding and advertising are not the same process. Advertising any given product is only one part of branding's grand plan, as are sponsorship and logo licensing. Think of the brand as the core meaning of the modern corporation, and of the advertisement as one vehicle used to convey that meaning to the world. The first mass-marketing campaigns, starting in the second half of the nineteenth century, had more to do with advertising than with branding as we understand it today. Faced with a range of recently invented products - the radio, phonograph, car, light bulb and so on - advertisers had more pressing tasks than creating a brand identity for any given corporation; first, they had to change the way people lived their lives. Ads had to inform consumers about the existence of some new invention, then convince them that their lives would be better if they used, for example, cars instead of wagons, telephones instead of mail and electric light instead of oil lamps. Many of these new products bore brand names - some of which are still around today - but these were almost incidental. These products were themselves news; that was almost advertisement enough. The first brand-based products appeared at around the same time as the invention-based ads, largely because of another relatively recent innovation: the factory. When goods began to be produced in factories, not only were entirely new products being introduced but old products - even basic staples - were appearing in strikingly new forms. What made early branding efforts different from more straightforward salesmanship was that the market was now being flooded with uniform mass-produced products that were virtually indistinguishable from one another. Competitive branding became a necessity of the machine age - within a context of manufactured sameness, image-based difference had to be manufactured along with the product. So the role of advertising changed from delivering product news bulletins to building an image around a particular brand-name version of a product. The first task of branding was to bestow proper names on generic goods such as sugar, flour, soap and cereal, which had previously been scooped out of barrels by local shopkeepers. In the 1880s, corporate logos were introduced to mass-produced products like Campbell's Soup, H.J. Heinz pickles and Quaker Oats cereal. As design historians and theorists Ellen Lupton and J. Abbott Miller note, logos were tailored to evoke familiarity and folksiness, in an effort to counteract the new and unsettling anonymity of packaged goods. \"Familiar personalities such as Dr. Brown, Uncle Ben, Aunt Jemima, and Old Grand-Dad came to replace the shop-keeper, who was traditionally responsible for measuring bulk foods for customers and acting as an advocate for products . . . a nationwide vocabulary of brand names replaced the small local shopkeeper as the interface between consumer and product. After the product names and characters had been established, advertising gave them a venue to speak directly to would-be consumers. The corporate \"personality,\" uniquely named, packaged and advertised, had arrived. For the most part, the ad campaigns at the end of the nineteenth century and the start of the twentieth used a set of rigid, pseudoscientific formulas: rivals were never mentioned, ad copy used declarative statements only and headlines had to be large, with lots of white space - according to one turn-of- the-century adman, \"an advertisement should be big enough to make an impression but not any bigger than the thing advertised.\" But there were those in the industry who understood that advertising wasn't just scientific; it was also spiritual. Brands could conjure a feeling - think of Aunt Jemima's comforting presence - but not only that, entire corporations could themselves embody a meaning of their own. In the early twenties, legendary adman Bruce Barton turned General Motors into a metaphor for the American family, \"something personal, warm and human,\" while GE was not so much the name of the faceless General Electric Company as, in Barton's words, \"the initials of a friend.\" In 1923 Barton said that the role of advertising was to help corporations find their soul. The son of a preacher, he drew on his religious upbringing for uplifting messages: \"I like to think of advertising as something big, something splendid, something which goes deep down into an institution and gets hold of the soul of it. . . . Institutions have souls, just as men and nations have souls,\" he told GM president Pierre du Pont. General Motors ads began to tell stories about the people who drove its cars - the preacher, the pharmacist or the country doctor who, thanks to his trusty GM, arrived \"at the bedside of a dying child\" just in time \"to bring it back to life.\" By the end of the 1940s, there was a burgeoning awareness that a brand wasn't just a mascot or a catchphrase or a picture printed on the label of a company's product; the company as a whole could have a brand identity or a \"corporate consciousness,\" as this ephemeral quality was termed at the time. As this idea evolved, the adman ceased to see himself as a pitchman and instead saw himself as \"the philosopher-king of commercial culture,\" in the words of ad critic Randall Rothberg. The search for the true meaning of brands - or the \"brand essence,\" as it is often called - gradually took the agencies away from individual products and their attributes and toward a psychological/anthropological examination of what brands mean to the culture and to people's lives. This was seen to be of crucial importance, since corporations may manufacture products, but what consumers buy are brands. It took several decades for the manufacturing world to adjust to this shift. It clung to the idea that its core business was still production and that branding was an important add-on. Then came the brand equity mania of the eighties, the defining moment of which arrived in 1988 when Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.6 billion - six times what the company was worth on paper. The price difference, apparently, was the cost of the word \"Kraft.\" Of course Wall Street was aware that decades of marketing and brand bolstering added value to a company over and above its assets and total annual sales. But with the Kraft purchase, a huge dollar value had been assigned to something that had previously been abstract and unquantifiable - a brand name. This was spectacular news for the ad world, which was now able to make the claim that advertising spending was more than just a sales strategy: it was an investment in cold hard equity. The more you spend, the more your company is worth. Not surprisingly, this led to a considerable increase in spending on advertising. More important, it sparked a renewed interest in puffing up brand identities, a project that involved far more than a few billboards and TV spots. It was about pushing the envelope in sponsorship deals, dreaming up new areas in which to \"extend\" the brand, as well as perpetually probing the zeitgeist to ensure that the \"essence\" selected for one's brand would resonate karmically with its target market. For reasons that will be explored in the rest of this chapter, this radical shift in corporate philosophy has sent manufacturers on a cultural feeding frenzy as they seize upon every corner of unmarketed landscape in search of the oxygen needed to inflate their brands. In the process, virtually nothing has been left un-branded. That's quite an impressive feat, considering that as recently as 1993 Wall Street had pronounced the brand dead, or as good as dead. The Brand's Death (Rumors of Which Had Been Greatly Exaggerated) The evolution of the brand had one scary episode when it seemed to face extinction. To understand this brush with death, we must first come to terms with advertising's own special law of gravity, which holds that if you aren't rocketing upward you will soon come crashing down. The marketing world is always reaching a new zenith, breaking through last year's world record and planning to do it again next year with increasing numbers of ads and aggressive new formulae for reaching consumers. The advertising industry's astronomical rate of growth is neatly reflected in year-to-year figures measuring total ad spending in the U.S, which have gone up so steadily that by 1998 the figure was set to reach $196.5 billion, while global ad spending is estimated at $435 billion. According to the 1998 United Nations Human Development Report, the growth in global ad spending \"now outpaces the growth of the world economy by one-third.\" This pattern is a by-product of the firmly held belief that brands need continuous and constantly increasing advertising in order to stay in the same place. According to this law of diminishing returns, the more advertising there is out there (and there always is more, because of this law), the more aggressively brands must market to stand out. And of course, no one is more keenly aware of advertising's ubiquity than the advertisers themselves, who view commercial inundation as a clear and persuasive call for more - and more intrusive - advertising. With so much competition, the agencies argue, clients must spend more than ever to make sure their pitch screeches so loud it can be heard over all the others. David Lubars, a senior ad executive in the Omnicom Group, explains the industry's guiding principle with more candor than most. Consumers, he says, \"are like roaches - you spray them and spray them and they get immune after a while.\" So, if consumers are like roaches, then marketers must forever be dreaming up new concoctions for industrial-strength Raid. And nineties marketers, being on a more advanced rung of the sponsorship spiral, have dutifully come up with clever and intrusive new selling techniques to do just that. Recent highlights include these innovations: Gordon's gin experimented with filling British movie theaters with the scent of juniper berries; Calvin Klein stuck \"CK Be\" perfume strips on the backs of Ticketmaster concert envelopes; and in some Scandinavian countries you can get \"free\" long-distance calls with ads cutting into your telephone conversations. And there's plenty more, stretching across ever more expansive surfaces and cramming into the smallest of crevices: sticker ads on pieces of fruit promoting ABC sitcoms, Levi's ads in public washrooms, corporate logos on boxes of Girl Guide cookies, ads for pop albums on takeout food containers, and ads for Batman movies projected on sidewalks or into the night sky. There are already ads on benches in national parks as well as on library cards in public libraries, and in December 1998 NASA announced plans to solicit ads on its space stations. Pepsi's on-going threat to project its logo onto the moon's surface hasn't yet materialized, but Mattel did paint an entire street in Salford, England, \"a shriekingly bright bubblegum hue\" of pink - houses, porches, trees, road, sidewalk, dogs.and cars were all accessories in the televised celebrations of Barbie Pink Month. Barbie is but one small part of the ballooning $30 billion \"experiential communication\" industry, the phrase now used to encompass the staging of such branded pieces of corporate performance art and other \"happenings.\" That we live a sponsored life is now a truism and it's a pretty safe bet that as spending on advertising continues to rise, we roaches will be treated to even more of these ingenious gimmicks, making it ever more difficult and more seemingly pointless to muster even an ounce of outrage. But as mentioned earlier, there was a time when the new frontiers facing the advertising industry weren't looking quite so promising. On April 2, 1993, advertising itself was called into question by the very brands the industry had been building, in some cases, for over two centuries. That day is known in marketing circles as \"Marlboro Friday,\" and it refers to a sudden announcement from Philip Morris that it would slash the price of Marlboro cigarettes by 20 percent in an attempt to compete with bargain brands that were eating into its market. The pundits went nuts, announcing in frenzied unison that not only was Marlboro dead, all brand names were dead. The reasoning was that if a \"prestige\" brand like Marlboro, whose image had been carefully groomed, preened and enhanced with more than a billion advertising dollars, was desperate enough to compete with no-names, then clearly the whole concept of branding had lost its currency. The public had seen the advertising, and the public didn't care. The Marlboro Man, after all, was not any old campaign; launched in 1954, it was the longest-running ad campaign in history. It was a legend. If the Marlboro Man had crashed, well, then, brand equity had crashed as well. The implication that Americans were suddenly thinking for themselves en masse reverberated through Wall Street. The same day Philip Morris announced its price cut, stock prices nose-dived for all the household brands: Heinz, Quaker Oats, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Procter and Gamble and RJR Nabisco. Philip Morris's own stock took the worst beating. Bob Stanojev, national director of consumer products marketing for Ernst and Young, explained the logic behind Wall Street's panic: \"If one or two powerhouse consumer products companies start to cut prices for good, there's going to be an avalanche. Welcome to the value generation.\" Yes, it was one of those moments of overstated instant consensus, but it was not entirely without cause. Marlboro had always sold itself on the strength of its iconic image marketing, not on anything so prosaic as its price. As we now know, the Marlboro Man survived the price wars without sustaining too much damage. At the time, however, Wall Street saw Philip Morris's decision as symbolic of a sea change. The price cut was an admission that Marlboro's name was no longer sufficient to sustain the flagship position, which in a context where image is equity meant that Marlboro had blinked. And when Marlboro - one of the quintessential global brands - blinks, it raises questions about branding that reach beyond Wall Street, and way beyond Philip Morris. The panic of Marlboro Friday was not a reaction to a single incident. Rather, it was the culmination of years of escalating anxiety in the face of some rather dramatic shifts in consumer habits that were seen to be eroding the market share of household-name brands, from Tide to Kraft. Bargain-conscious shoppers, hit hard by the recession, were starting to pay more attention to price than to the prestige bestowed on their products by the yuppie ad campaigns of the 1980s. The public was suffering from a bad case of what is known in the industry as \"brand blindness.\" Study after study showed that baby boomers, blind to the alluring images of advertising and deaf to the empty promises of celebrity spokespersons, were breaking their lifelong brand loyalties and choosing to feed their families with private-label brands from the supermark - claiming, heretically, that they couldn't tell the difference. From the beginning of the recession to 1993, Loblaw's President's Choice line, Wal-Mart's Great Value and Marks and Spencer's St. Michael prepared foods had nearly doubled their market share in North America and Europe. The computer market, meanwhile, was flooded by inexpensive clones, causing IBM to slash its prices and otherwise impale itself. It appeared to be a return to the proverbial shopkeeper dishing out generic goods from the barrel in a prebranded era. The bargain craze of the early nineties shook the name brands to their core. Suddenly it seemed smarter to put resources into price reductions and other incentives than into fabulously expensive ad campaigns. This ambivalence began to be reflected in the amounts companies were willing to pay for so-called brand-enhancing advertising. Then, in 1991, it happened: overall advertising spending actually went down by 5.5 percent for the top 100 brands. It was the first interruption in the steady increase of U.S. ad expenditures since a tiny dip of 0.6 percent in 1970, and the largest drop in four decades. It's not that top corporations weren't flogging their products, it's just that to attract those suddenly fickle customers, many decided to put their money into promotions such as giveaways, contests, in-store displays and (like Marlboro) price reductions. In 1983, American brands spent 70 percent of their total marketing budgets on advertising, and 30 percent on these other forms of promotion. By 1993, the ratio had flipped: only 25 percent went to ads, with the remaining 75 percent going to promotions. Predictably, the ad agencies panicked when they saw their prestige clients abandoning them for the bargain bins and they did what they could to convince big spenders like Procter and Gamble and Philip Morris that the proper route out of the brand crisis wasn't less brand marketing but more. At the annual meeting of the U.S. Association of National Advertisers in 1988, Graham H. Phillips, the U.S. chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, berated the assembled executives for stooping to participate in \"a commodity marketplace\" rather than an image-based one. \"I doubt that many of you would welcome a commodity marketplace in which one competed solely on price, promotion and trade deals, all of which can easily be duplicated by competition, lead-ing to ever-decreasing profits, decay and eventual bankruptcy.\" Others spoke of the importance of maintaining \"conceptual value-added,\" which in effect means adding nothing but marketing. Stooping to compete on the basis of real value, the agencies ominously warned, would spell not just the death of the brand, but corporate death as well. Around the same time as Marlboro Friday, the ad industry felt so under siege that market researcher Jack Myers published Adbashing: Surviving the Attacks on Advertising, a book-length call to arms against everyone from supermarket cashiers handing out coupons for canned peas to legislators contemplating a new tax on ads. \"We, as an industry, must recognize that adbashing is a threat to capitalism, to a free press, to our basic forms of entertainment, and to the future of our children,\" he wrote. Despite these fighting words, most market watchers remained convinced that the heyday of the value-added brand had come and gone. The eighties had gone in for brands and hoity-toity designer labels, reasoned David Scotland, European director of Hiram Walker. The nineties would clearly be all about value. \"A few years ago,\" he observed, \"it might have been considered smart to wear a shirt with a designer's logo embroidered on the pocket; frankly, it now seems a bit naff.\" And from the other side of the Atlantic, Cincinnati journalist Shelly Reese came to the same conclusion about our no-name future, writing that \"Americans with Calvin Klein splashed across their hip pocket aren't pushing grocery carts full of Perrier down the aisles anymore. Instead they're sporting togs with labels like Kmart's Jaclyn Smith and maneuvering carts full of Kroger Co.'s Big K soda. Welcome to the private label decade.\" Scotland and Reese, if they remember their bold pronouncements, are probably feeling just a little bit silly right now. Their embroidered \"pocket\" logos sound positively subdued by today's logomaniacal standards, and sales of name-brand bottled water have been increasing at an annual rate of 9 percent, turning it into a $3.4 billion industry by 1997. From today's logo-quilted perch, it's almost unfathomable that a mere six years ago, death sentences for the brand seemed not only plausible but self-evident. So just how did we get from obituaries for Tide to today's battalions of volunteer billboards for Tommy Hilfiger, Nike and Calvin Klein? Who slipped the steroids into the brand's comeback? The Brands Bounce Back There were some brands that were watching from the sidelines as Wall Street declared the death of the brand. Funny, they must have thought, we don't feel dead. Just as the admen had predicted at the beginning of the recession, the companies that exited the downturn running were the ones who opted for marketing over value every time: Nike, Apple, the Body Shop, Calvin Klein, Disney, Levi's and Starbucks. Not only were these brands doing just fine, thank you very much, but the act of branding was becoming a larger and larger focus of their businesses. For these companies, the ostensible product was mere filler for the real production: the brand. They integrated the idea of branding into the very fabric of their companies. Their corporate cultures were so tight and cloistered that to outsiders they appeared to be a cross between fraternity house, religious cult and sanitarium. Everything was an ad for the brand: bizarre lexicons for describing employees (partners, baristas, team players, crew members), company chants, superstar CEOs, fanatical attention to design consistency, a propensity for monument-building, and New Age mission statements. Unlike classic household brand names, such as Tide and Marlboro, these logos weren't losing their currency, they were in the midst of breaking every barrier in the marketing world - becoming cultural accessories and lifestyle philosophers. These companies didn't wear their image like a cheap shirt - their image was so integrated with their business that other people wore it as their shirt. And when the brands crashed, these companies didn't even notice - they were branded to the bone. So the real legacy of Marlboro Friday is that it simultaneously brought the two most significant developments in nineties marketing and consumerism into sharp focus: the deeply unhip big-box bargain stores that provide the essentials of life and monopolize a disproportionate share of the market (Wal-Mart et al.) and the extra-premium \"attitude\" brands that provide the essentials of lifestyle and monopolize ever-expanding stretches of cultural space (Nike et al.). The way these two tiers of consumerism developed would have a profound impact on the economy in the years to come. When overall ad expenditures took a nosedive in 1991, Nike and Reebok were busy playing advertising chicken, with each company increasing its budget to outspend the other. In 1991 alone, Reebok upped its ad spending by 71.9 percent, while Nike pumped an extra 24.6 percent into its already soaring ad budget, bringing the company's total spending on marketing to a staggering $250 million annually. Far from worrying about competing on price, the sneaker pimps were designing ever more intricate and pseudoscientific air pockets, and driving up prices by signing star athletes to colossal sponsorship deals. The fetish strategy seemed to be working fine: in the six years prior to 1993, Nike had gone from a $750 million company to a $4 billion one and Phil Knight's Beaverton, Oregon, company emerged from the recession with profits 900 percent higher than when it began. Benetton and Calvin Klein, meanwhile, were also upping their spending on lifestyle marketing, using ads to associate their lines with risqu\u00e9 art and progressive politics. Clothes barely appeared in these high-concept advertisements, let alone prices. Even more abstract was Absolut Vodka, which for some years now had been developing a marketing strategy in which its product disappeared and its brand was nothing but a blank bottle-shaped space that could be filled with whatever content a particular audience most wanted from its brands: intellectual in Harper's, futuristic in Wired, alternative in Spin, loud and proud in Out and \"Absolut Centerfold\" in Playboy. The brand reinvented itself as a cultural sponge, soaking up and morphing to its surroundings.",

The brand reinvented itself as a cultural sponge, soaking up and morphing to its surroundings.</p> <p>Saturn, too, came out of nowhere in October 1990 when GM launched a car built not out of steel and rubber but out of New Age spirituality and seventies feminism. After the car had been on the market a few years, the company held a \"homecoming\" weekend for Saturn owners, during which they could visit the auto plant and have a cookout with the people who made their cars. As the Saturn ads boasted at the time, \"44,000 people spent their vacations with us, at a car plant.\" It was as if Aunt Jemima had come to life and invited you over to her house for dinner. In 1993, the year the Marlboro Man was temporarily hobbled by \"brand-blind\" consumers, Microsoft made its striking debut on Advertising Age's list of the top 200 ad spenders - the very same year that Apple computer increased its marketing budget by 30 percent after already making branding history with its Orwellian takeoff ad launch during the 1984 Super Bowl. Like Saturn, both companies were selling a hip new relationship to the machine that left Big Blue IBM looking as clunky and menacing as the now-dead Cold War. And then there were the companies that had always understood that they were selling brands before product. Coke, Pepsi, McDonald's, Burger King and Disney weren't fazed by the brand crisis, opting instead to escalate the brand war, especially since they had their eyes firmly fixed on global expansion. They were joined in this project by a wave of sophisticated producer/retailers who hit full stride in the late eighties and early nineties. The Gap, Ikea and the Body Shop were spreading like wildfire during this period, masterfully transforming the generic into the brand-specific, largely through bold, carefully branded packaging and the promotion of an \"experiential\" shopping environment. The Body Shop had been a presence in Britain since the seventies, but it wasn't until 1988 that it began sprouting like a green weed on every street corner in the U.S. Even during the darkest years of the recession, the company opened between forty and fifty American stores a year. Most baffling of all to Wall Street, it pulled off the expansion without spending a dime on advertising. Who needed billboards and magazine ads when retail outlets were three-dimensional advertisements for an ethical and ecological approach to cosmetics? The BodyShop was all brand.</p> <p>The Starbucks coffee chain, meanwhile, was also expanding during this period without laying out much in advertising; instead, it was spinning off its name into a wide range of branded projects: Starbucks airline coffee, office coffee, coffee ice cream, coffee beer. Starbucks seemed to understand brand names at a level even deeper than Madison Avenue, incorporating marketing into every fiber of its corporate concept - from the chain's strategic association with books, blues and jazz to its Euro-latte lingo. What the success of both the Body Shop and Starbucks showed was how far the branding project had come in moving beyond splashing one's logo on a billboard. Here were two companies that had fostered powerful identities by making their brand concept into a virus and sending it out into the culture via a variety of channels: cultural sponsorship, political controversy, the consumer experience and brand extensions. Direct advertising, in this context, was viewed as a rather clumsy intrusion into a much more organic approach to image building. Scott Bedbury, Starbucks' vice president of marketing, openly recognized that \"consumers don't truly believe there's a huge difference between products,\" which is why brands must \"establish emotional ties\" with their customers through \"the Starbucks Experience.\" The people who line up for Starbucks, writes CEO Howard Shultz, aren't just there for the coffee. \"It's the romance of the coffee experience, the feeling of warmth and community people get in Starbucks stores.\" </p> <p>Interestingly, before moving to Starbucks, Bedbury was head of marketing at Nike, where he oversaw the launch of the \"Just Do It!\" slogan, among other watershed branding moments. In the following passage, he explains the common techniques used to infuse the two very different brands with meaning: Nike, for example, is leveraging the deep emotional connection that people have with sports and fitness. With Starbucks, we see how coffee has woven itself into the fabric of people's lives, and that's our opportunity for emotional leverage. . . . A great brand raises the bar - it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters. </p> <p>This was the secret, it seemed, of all the success stories of the late eighties and early nineties. The lesson of Marlboro Friday was that there never really was a brand crisis - only brands that had crises of confidence. The brands would be okay, Wall Street concluded, so long as they believed fervently in the principles of branding and never, ever blinked. Overnight, \"Brands, not products!\" became the rallying cry for a marketing renaissance led by a new breed of companies that saw themselves as \"meaning brokers\" instead of product producers. What was changing was the idea of what - in both advertising and branding - was being sold. The old paradigm had it that all marketing was selling a product. In the new model, however, the product always takes a back seat to the real product, the brand, and the selling of the brand acquired an extra component that can only be described as spiritual. Advertising is about hawking product. Branding, in its truest and most advanced incarnations, is about corporate transcendence. It may sound flaky, but that's precisely the point. On Marlboro Friday, a line was drawn in the sand between the lowly price slashers and the high-concept brand builders. The brand builders conquered and a new consensus was born: the products that will flourish in the future will be the ones presented not as \"commodities\" but as concepts: the brand as experience, as lifestyle. </p> <p>Ever since, a select group of corporations has been attempting to free itself from the corporeal world of commodities, manufacturing and products to exist on another plane. Anyone can manufacture a product, they reason (and as the success of private-label brands during the recession proved, anyone did). Such menial tasks, therefore, can and should be farmed out to contractors and subcontractors whose only concern is filling the order on time and under budget (ideally in the Third World, where labor is dirt cheap, laws are lax and tax breaks come by the bushel). Headquarters, meanwhile, is free to focus on the real business at hand - creating a corporate mythology powerful enough to infuse meaning into these raw objects just by signing its name. The corporate world has always had a deep New Age streak, fed - it has become clear - by a profound need that could not be met simply by trading widgets for cash. But when branding captured the corporate imagination, New Age vision quests took center stage. As Nike CEO Phil Knight explains, \"For years we thought of ourselves as a production-oriented company, meaning we put all our emphasis on designing and manufacturing the product. But now we understand that the most important thing we do is market the product. We've come around to saying that Nike is a marketing-oriented company, and the product is our most important marketing tool.\" This project has since been taken to an even more advanced level with the emergence of on-line corporate giants such as Amazon.com. It is on-line that the purest brands are being built: liberated from the real-world burdens of stores and product manufacturing, these brands are free to soar, less as the disseminators of goods or services than as collective hallucinations. Tom Peters, who has long coddled the inner flake in many a hard-nosed CEO, latched on to the branding craze as the secret to financial success, separating the transcendental logos and the earthbound products into two distinct categories of companies. \"The top half - Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Disney, and so on - are pure 'players' in brainware. The bottom half [Ford and GM] are still lumpy-object purveyors, though automobiles are much 'smarter' than they used to be,\" Peters writes in The Circle of Innovation (1997), an ode to the power of marketing over production.</p> <p>When Levi's began to lose market share in the late nineties, the trend was widely attributed to the company's failure - despite lavish ad spending - to transcend its products and become a free-standing meaning. \"Maybe one of Levi's problems is that it has no Cola,\" speculated Jennifer Steinhauer in The New York Times. \"It has no denim-toned house paint. Levi makes what is essentially a commodity: blue jeans. Its ads may evoke rugged out-doorsmanship, but Levi hasn't promoted any particular life style to sell other products.\"</p> <p>In this high-stakes new context, the cutting-edge ad agencies no longer sold companies on individual campaigns but on their ability to act as \"brand stewards\": identifying, articulating and protecting the corporate soul. Not surprisingly, this spelled good news for the U.S. advertising industry, which in 1994 saw a spending increase of 8.6 percent over the previous year. In one year, the ad industry went from a near crisis to another \"best year yet.\" And that was only the beginning of triumphs to come. By 1997, corporate advertising, defined as \"ads that position a corporation, its values, its personality and character\" were up 18 percent from the year before. With this wave of brand mania has come a new breed of businessman, one who will proudly inform you that Brand X is not a product but a way of life, an attitude, a set of values, a look, an idea. And it sounds really great - way better than that Brand X is a screwdriver, or a hamburger chain, or a pair of jeans, or even a very successful line of running shoes. Nike, Phil Knight announced in the late eighties, is \"a sports company\"; its mission is not to sell shoes but to \"enhance people's lives through sports and fitness\" and to keep \"the magic of sports alive.\"</p> <p>Company president-cum-sneaker-shaman Tom Clark explains that \"the inspiration of sports allows us to rebirth ourselves constantly.\" Reports of such \"brand vision\" epiphanies began surfacing from all corners. \"Polaroid's problem,\" diagnosed the chairman of its advertising agency, John Hegarty, \"was that they kept thinking of themselves as a camera. But the '[brand] vision' process taught us something: Polaroid is not a camera - it's a social lubricant\". IBM isn't selling computers, it's selling business \"solutions.\" Swatch is not about watches, it is about the idea of time. At Diesel Jeans, owner Renzo Rosso told Paper magazine, \"We don't sell a product, we sell a style of life. I think we have created a movement. . . . The Diesel concept is everything. It's the way to live, it's the way to wear, it's the to do something.\" And as Body Shop founder Anita Roddick explained to me, her stores aren't about what they sell, they are the conveyers of a grand idea - a political philosophy about women, the environment and ethical business. \"I just use the company that I surprisingly created as a success - it shouldn't have been like this, it wasn't meant to be like this - to stand on the products to shout out on these issues,\" Roddick says. The famous late graphic designer Tibor Kalman summed up the shifting role of the brand this way: \"The original notion of the brand was quality, but now brand is a stylistic badge of courage.\"</p> <p>The idea of selling the courageous message of a brand, as opposed to a product, intoxicated these CEOs, providing as it did an opportunity for seemingly limitless expansion. After all, if a brand was not a product, it could be anything! And nobody embraced branding theory with more evangelical zeal than Richard Branson, whose Virgin Group has branded joint ventures in everything from music to bridal gowns to airlines to cola to financial services. Branson refers derisively to the \"stilted Anglo-Saxon view of consumers,\" which holds that a name should be associated with a product like sneakers or soft drinks, and opts instead for \"the Asian 'trick'\" of the keiretsus (a Japanese term meaning a network of linked corporations). The idea, he explains, is to \"build brands not around products but around reputation. The great Asian names imply quality, price and innovation rather than a specific item. I call these 'attribute' brands: They do not relate directly to one product - such as a Mars bar or a Coca-Cola - but instead to a set of values.\"</p> <p>Tommy Hilfiger, meanwhile, is less in the business of manufacturing clothes than he is in the business of signing his name. The company is run entirely through licensing agreements, with Hilfiger commissioning all its products from a group of other companies: Jockey International makes Hilfiger underwear, Pepe Jeans London makes Hilfiger jeans, Oxford Industries make Tommy shirts, the Stride Rite Corporation makes its footwear. What does Tommy Hilfiger manufacture? Nothing at all.</p> <p>So pass&amp;#233 had products become in the age of lifestyle branding that by the late nineties, newer companies like Lush cosmetics and Old Navy clothing began playing with the idea of old-style commodities as a source of retro marketing imagery. The Lush chain serves up its face masks and moisturizers out of refrigerated stainless-steel bowls, spooned into plastic containers with grocery-store labels. Old Navy showcases its shrink-wrapped T-shirts and sweatshirts in deli-style chrome refrigerators, as if they were meat or cheese. When you are a pure, concept-driven brand, the aesthetics of raw product can prove as \"authentic\" as loft living.</p> <p>And lest the branding business be dismissed as the playground of trendy consumer items such as sneakers, jeans and New Age beverages, think again. Caterpillar, best known for building tractors and busting unions, has barreled into the branding business, launching the Cat accessories line: boots, back-packs, hats and anything else calling out for a postindustrial je ne sais quoi. Intel Corp., which makes computer parts no one sees and few understand, transformed its processors into a fetish brand with TV ads featuring line workers in funky metallic space suits dancing to \"Shake Your Groove Thing.\" The Intel mascots proved so popular that the company has sold hundreds of thousands of bean-filled dolls modeled on the shimmery dancing technicians. Little wonder, then, that when asked about the company's decision to diversify its products, the senior vice president for sales and marketing, Paul S. Otellini, replied that Intel is \"like Coke. One brand, many different products.\" And if Caterpillar and Intel can brand, surely anyone can.</p> <p>There is, in fact, a new strain in marketing theory that holds that even the lowliest natural resources, barely processed, can develop brand identities, thus giving way to hefty premium-price markups. In an essay appropriately titled \"How to Brand Sand,\" advertising executives Sam I. Hill, Jack McGrath and Sandeep Dayal team up to tell the corporate world that with the right marketing plan, nobody has to stay stuck in the stuff business. \"Based on extensive research, we would argue that you can indeed brand not only sand, but also wheat, beef, brick, metals, concrete, chemicals, corn grits and an endless variety of commodities traditionally considered immune to the process.\" Over the past six years, spooked by the near-death experience of Marlboro Friday, global corporations have leaped on the brand-wagon with what can only be described as a religious fervor. Never again would the corporate world stoop to praying at the altar of the commodity market. From now on they would worship only graven media images. Or to quote Tom Peters, the brand man himself: \"Brand! Brand!! Brand!!! That's the message . . . for the late '90s and beyond.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Brands Bounce Back There were some brands that were watching from the sidelines as Wall Street declared the death of the brand. Funny, they must have thought, we don't feel dead. Just as the admen had predicted at the beginning of the recession, the companies that exited the downturn running were the ones who opted for marketing over value every time: Nike, Apple, the Body Shop, Calvin Klein, Disney, Levi's and Starbucks. Not only were these brands doing just fine, thank you very much, but the act of branding was becoming a larger and larger focus of their businesses. For these companies, the ostensible product was mere filler for the real production: the brand. They integrated the idea of branding into the very fabric of their companies. Their corporate cultures were so tight and cloistered that to outsiders they appeared to be a cross between fraternity house, religious cult and sanitarium. Everything was an ad for the brand: bizarre lexicons for describing employees (partners, baristas, team players, crew members), company chants, superstar CEOs, fanatical attention to design consistency, a propensity for monument-building, and New Age mission statements. Unlike classic household brand names, such as Tide and Marlboro, these logos weren't losing their currency, they were in the midst of breaking every barrier in the marketing world - becoming cultural accessories and lifestyle philosophers. These companies didn't wear their image like a cheap shirt - their image was so integrated with their business that other people wore it as their shirt. And when the brands crashed, these companies didn't even notice - they were branded to the bone. So the real legacy of Marlboro Friday is that it simultaneously brought the two most significant developments in nineties marketing and consumerism into sharp focus: the deeply unhip big-box bargain stores that provide the essentials of life and monopolize a disproportionate share of the market (Wal-Mart et al.) and the extra-premium \"attitude\" brands that provide the essentials of lifestyle and monopolize ever-expanding stretches of cultural space (Nike et al.). The way these two tiers of consumerism developed would have a profound impact on the economy in the years to come. When overall ad expenditures took a nosedive in 1991, Nike and Reebok were busy playing advertising chicken, with each company increasing its budget to outspend the other. In 1991 alone, Reebok upped its ad spending by 71.9 percent, while Nike pumped an extra 24.6 percent into its already soaring ad budget, bringing the company's total spending on marketing to a staggering $250 million annually. Far from worrying about competing on price, the sneaker pimps were designing ever more intricate and pseudoscientific air pockets, and driving up prices by signing star athletes to colossal sponsorship deals. The fetish strategy seemed to be working fine: in the six years prior to 1993, Nike had gone from a $750 million company to a $4 billion one and Phil Knight's Beaverton, Oregon, company emerged from the recession with profits 900 percent higher than when it began. Benetton and Calvin Klein, meanwhile, were also upping their spending on lifestyle marketing, using ads to associate their lines with risqu\u00e9 art and progressive politics. Clothes barely appeared in these high-concept advertisements, let alone prices. Even more abstract was Absolut Vodka, which for some years now had been developing a marketing strategy in which its product disappeared and its brand was nothing but a blank bottle-shaped space that could be filled with whatever content a particular audience most wanted from its brands: intellectual in Harper's, futuristic in Wired, alternative in Spin, loud and proud in Out and \"Absolut Centerfold\" in Playboy. The brand reinvented itself as a cultural sponge, soaking up and morphing to its surroundings. Saturn, too, came out of nowhere in October 1990 when GM launched a car built not out of steel and rubber but out of New Age spirituality and seventies feminism. After the car had been on the market a few years, the company held a \"homecoming\" weekend for Saturn owners, during which they could visit the auto plant and have a cookout with the people who made their cars. As the Saturn ads boasted at the time, \"44,000 people spent their vacations with us, at a car plant.\" It was as if Aunt Jemima had come to life and invited you over to her house for dinner. In 1993, the year the Marlboro Man was temporarily hobbled by \"brand-blind\" consumers, Microsoft made its striking debut on Advertising Age's list of the top 200 ad spenders - the very same year that Apple computer increased its marketing budget by 30 percent after already making branding history with its Orwellian takeoff ad launch during the 1984 Super Bowl. Like Saturn, both companies were selling a hip new relationship to the machine that left Big Blue IBM looking as clunky and menacing as the now-dead Cold War. And then there were the companies that had always understood that they were selling brands before product. Coke, Pepsi, McDonald's, Burger King and Disney weren't fazed by the brand crisis, opting instead to escalate the brand war, especially since they had their eyes firmly fixed on global expansion. They were joined in this project by a wave of sophisticated producer/retailers who hit full stride in the late eighties and early nineties. The Gap, Ikea and the Body Shop were spreading like wildfire during this period, masterfully transforming the generic into the brand-specific, largely through bold, carefully branded packaging and the promotion of an \"experiential\" shopping environment. The Body Shop had been a presence in Britain since the seventies, but it wasn't until 1988 that it began sprouting like a green weed on every street corner in the U.S. Even during the darkest years of the recession, the company opened between forty and fifty American stores a year. Most baffling of all to Wall Street, it pulled off the expansion without spending a dime on advertising. Who needed billboards and magazine ads when retail outlets were three-dimensional advertisements for an ethical and ecological approach to cosmetics? The BodyShop was all brand. The Starbucks coffee chain, meanwhile, was also expanding during this period without laying out much in advertising; instead, it was spinning off its name into a wide range of branded projects: Starbucks airline coffee, office coffee, coffee ice cream, coffee beer. Starbucks seemed to understand brand names at a level even deeper than Madison Avenue, incorporating marketing into every fiber of its corporate concept - from the chain's strategic association with books, blues and jazz to its Euro-latte lingo. What the success of both the Body Shop and Starbucks showed was how far the branding project had come in moving beyond splashing one's logo on a billboard. Here were two companies that had fostered powerful identities by making their brand concept into a virus and sending it out into the culture via a variety of channels: cultural sponsorship, political controversy, the consumer experience and brand extensions. Direct advertising, in this context, was viewed as a rather clumsy intrusion into a much more organic approach to image building. Scott Bedbury, Starbucks' vice president of marketing, openly recognized that \"consumers don't truly believe there's a huge difference between products,\" which is why brands must \"establish emotional ties\" with their customers through \"the Starbucks Experience.\" The people who line up for Starbucks, writes CEO Howard Shultz, aren't just there for the coffee. \"It's the romance of the coffee experience, the feeling of warmth and community people get in Starbucks stores.\" Interestingly, before moving to Starbucks, Bedbury was head of marketing at Nike, where he oversaw the launch of the \"Just Do It!\" slogan, among other watershed branding moments. In the following passage, he explains the common techniques used to infuse the two very different brands with meaning: Nike, for example, is leveraging the deep emotional connection that people have with sports and fitness. With Starbucks, we see how coffee has woven itself into the fabric of people's lives, and that's our opportunity for emotional leverage. . . . A great brand raises the bar - it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters. This was the secret, it seemed, of all the success stories of the late eighties and early nineties. The lesson of Marlboro Friday was that there never really was a brand crisis - only brands that had crises of confidence. The brands would be okay, Wall Street concluded, so long as they believed fervently in the principles of branding and never, ever blinked. Overnight, \"Brands, not products!\" became the rallying cry for a marketing renaissance led by a new breed of companies that saw themselves as \"meaning brokers\" instead of product producers. What was changing was the idea of what - in both advertising and branding - was being sold. The old paradigm had it that all marketing was selling a product. In the new model, however, the product always takes a back seat to the real product, the brand, and the selling of the brand acquired an extra component that can only be described as spiritual. Advertising is about hawking product. Branding, in its truest and most advanced incarnations, is about corporate transcendence. It may sound flaky, but that's precisely the point. On Marlboro Friday, a line was drawn in the sand between the lowly price slashers and the high-concept brand builders. The brand builders conquered and a new consensus was born: the products that will flourish in the future will be the ones presented not as \"commodities\" but as concepts: the brand as experience, as lifestyle. Ever since, a select group of corporations has been attempting to free itself from the corporeal world of commodities, manufacturing and products to exist on another plane. Anyone can manufacture a product, they reason (and as the success of private-label brands during the recession proved, anyone did). Such menial tasks, therefore, can and should be farmed out to contractors and subcontractors whose only concern is filling the order on time and under budget (ideally in the Third World, where labor is dirt cheap, laws are lax and tax breaks come by the bushel). Headquarters, meanwhile, is free to focus on the real business at hand - creating a corporate mythology powerful enough to infuse meaning into these raw objects just by signing its name. The corporate world has always had a deep New Age streak, fed - it has become clear - by a profound need that could not be met simply by trading widgets for cash. But when branding captured the corporate imagination, New Age vision quests took center stage. As Nike CEO Phil Knight explains, \"For years we thought of ourselves as a production-oriented company, meaning we put all our emphasis on designing and manufacturing the product. But now we understand that the most important thing we do is market the product. We've come around to saying that Nike is a marketing-oriented company, and the product is our most important marketing tool.\" This project has since been taken to an even more advanced level with the emergence of on-line corporate giants such as Amazon.com. It is on-line that the purest brands are being built: liberated from the real-world burdens of stores and product manufacturing, these brands are free to soar, less as the disseminators of goods or services than as collective hallucinations. Tom Peters, who has long coddled the inner flake in many a hard-nosed CEO, latched on to the branding craze as the secret to financial success, separating the transcendental logos and the earthbound products into two distinct categories of companies. \"The top half - Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Disney, and so on - are pure 'players' in brainware. The bottom half [Ford and GM] are still lumpy-object purveyors, though automobiles are much 'smarter' than they used to be,\" Peters writes in The Circle of Innovation (1997), an ode to the power of marketing over production. When Levi's began to lose market share in the late nineties, the trend was widely attributed to the company's failure - despite lavish ad spending - to transcend its products and become a free-standing meaning. \"Maybe one of Levi's problems is that it has no Cola,\" speculated Jennifer Steinhauer in The New York Times. \"It has no denim-toned house paint.

In the past decade, the number of grey seals in British waters has risen to 100,000 and they now account for half the world's population. The growth is particularly prominent in Scotland, which has more than 90% of Britain's seal population. \"Fishing communities are dying. They are going to have to do something because the seals are getting out of hand. They are going to have to control them,\" said Mr Sheil. Calls for a cull are likely to be greeted with opposition. In previous culls thousands of seals were shot on the Farne Islands off the coast of Northumberland and along the Scottish coast. The culls took place after the Home Office lifted special licences which protect the species. The lifting was met by a public outcry and protection orders were reinstated in 1978. The need for a cull was disputed yesterday by environmentalists. John Watkins, a scientist at Cambridgeshire-based Conservation Research, which helps the National Trust monitor the seal population, said there was no reason to support a cull. \"There is recent evidence to suggest that seal populations have started to plateau,\" he said. \"The biggest threat to fish is fish, next are sea birds, then it's man and then, way down the list, come seals and whales.\" In April 1988, the government lifted the year-round protection of seals on the Shetland Isles in an attempt to curb their growing numbers. This means that anyone holding a licence can shoot the animals outside of their June-August breeding season. The withdrawal of the protection orders on Shetland seals was described as \"very disappointing\" by Animal Concern. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation wants the government to introduce a seal commission - with similar powers to the deer commission - to investigate the best method of controlling seal numbers.",

      "body": "<p>That irascible old windbag, Randolph Churchill, once appalled the second Lord Rothermere by calling him \"pornographer royal\" for his ownership of the Daily Sketch and Sunday Dispatch. It was an unfair jibe since neither paper, even during those more buttoned-up times, contained what most people considered salacious material. But Rothermere, nervous about public reaction, immediately fired both editors. </p> <p>Now, almost 50 years later, a real \"porn king\" has bought three national newspapers and the public reaction, so far as one can gauge it, has been muted. No journalist has resigned as a matter of principle. Some readers have cancelled their orders, but not many. Advertisers have not announced a boycott. </p> <p>It is, of course, early days. Everyone is waiting to see just what Richard Desmond, publisher of Asian Babes and Nude Readers' Wives, has in store for the Daily and Sunday Express and Daily Star. His first statements, and actions, suggest that his ownership of the meretricious celebrity magazine OK! is going to play a greater part in his transformation of the papers than his pornography empire. </p> <p>Before we contemplate the future, though, let's take a brief look at the events that led to Desmond's surprising takeover. The deal may be done, but there could yet be a twist that makes his life somewhat difficult. Desmond paid \u00a3125m for the papers after secret negotiations with Clive Hollick, chief executive of United News &amp; Media. The sale included 50% of the West Ferry printing plant in east London, the other half of which is owned by Hollinger, owner of the Telegraph titles and one of the potential bidders for the Express. </p> <p>Hollinger's joint-ownership agreement with United News includes a clause in which it has pre-emptive rights to buy its 50% if there is a change of ownership. My understanding is that Hollinger's bosses, Conrad Black and Dan Colson, are \"looking closely\" at exercising its right because the formula which sets the purchase price is said to be \"attractive\". </p> <p>If this happens it will severely dent the profitability of Desmond's new property, because most of the \u00a310m a year currently made by Express Newspapers comes from West Ferry. Colson, Hollinger's vice-chairman, has no axe to grind with Desmond but he is upset that his company was prevented from obtaining enough information from United to make a competing - and probably higher - bid for the Express. \"We are outraged by the completely unprofessional process used by Hollick and his advisers,\" he said. \"We are astounded that they decided to sell when they might have got a better price for their shareholders.\" </p> <p>Two other bidders, the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, and the Barclay brothers' Press Holdings, take a similar view. Senior executives at all three companies were using language about Hollick last week that could never appear in a family newspaper, and probably not even in Asian Babes. But United's board has an answer: if it had agreed a deal with any of the three paper groups it would have faced a competition commission inquiry which might have lasted up to six months, and during that time there was every likelihood that the value of Express Newspapers would have declined. Selling to Desmond was therefore quick and, so to speak, clean. </p> <p>However much sense it makes commercially to United, senior Express journalists - and this certainly includes editor Rosie Boycott - still believe Hollick has betrayed them. They have never been able to understand why he bought the papers in the first place. He showed very little interest in them and never provided them with adequate investment. </p> <p>Given his shabby involvement in the post-Maxwell takeover of Mirror Group along with David Montgomery, his name is now mud among a legion of journalists. No wonder he was booed from Ludgate House last week. One executive said: \"Hollick likes to be known as a Labour peer, but what kind of socialist is it who presides over four years of cost-cutting and under-investing, and then sells us to a man like Desmond?\" </p> <p>There are plenty who believe, without a shred of evidence but lots of understandable prejudice, that Hollick's choice of buyer is his ultimate act of cynicism towards the Express staff. If a newspaper company with a good track record had bought the titles it might just turn their fortunes around. By selling to Desmond, who has no experience and expertise, the chances of reviving the papers are lower. So, should they go to the wall, Hollick will be able to boast that he didn't do such a bad job after all, and managed to extract \u00a3125m in the process. </p> <p>I very much doubt that scenario, but it does show the depth of feeling among Express journalists. \"It's depression city here,\" one told me on Friday morning. He had arrived to find that within 24 hours of Desmond's team moving in, the front page had been changed behind the editor's back. When Boycott left the evening before she had approved a front-page blurb for an article on Paula Yates. Next morning she discovered that Desmond's editorial director, Paul Ashford, had demanded that the night editor replace it with a blurb about OK! magazine's court battle over pictures of the Michael Douglas-Catherine Zeta Jones wedding with its rival Hello!. While Boycott consulted solicitors, doubtless contemplating a possible action for constructive dismissal, Ashford lamely explained to one of her assistants that he didn't realise he had done anything wrong. </p> <p>The chances of Boycott staying long are remote. Her background as a founder of the ground-breaking feminist magazine, Spare Rib, and her continuing adherence to its principles, cannot be squared with those of Desmond, whom she regards as an exploiter of women. She will not be mollified by the reply to this last point by one of Desmond's lieutenants. \"We don't exploit them,\" he explained. \"The girls get paid.\" </p> <p>Anyway, Desmond is intent on distancing himself from the activities that created his considerable personal fortune. \"We do not publish pornography,\" he told the Sunday Express yesterday, \"because pornography is illegal. We publish adult magazines.\" </p> <p>Semantics aside - dictionary definitions of pornography refer to it as a descriptive word in which legality plays no part - there is no doubt that Desmond's top-shelf magazines, along with Television X and the Fantasy Channel, are his major source of revenue. He may have hived them off into a separate company but there can be no doubt that, for the foreseeable future, the Daily Express will be funded by soft porn. </p> <p>There is, of course, a positive side. In four days Desmond has shown more interest in the papers than Hollick showed in four years, even circulating a morale-boosting memo of praise on Friday. He has increased the print run by more than 250,000 copies a day, and launched a \u00a31m TV promotion campaign based on the slogan \"It's OK! at the Express\". He says he will release big money for book serialisations and buy-ups. He will also axe four unprofitable internet sites this week, diverting the saved \u00a38m into the papers. </p> <p>He has enthused Daily Star editor Peter Hill, pledging a tie-up with his Fantasy Channel, though I'm uncertain whether a plunge downmarket by the Star will work: it has done better since it became less tacky. Nor do I think Desmond's supposed plan to launch a Sunday Star too clever. These are not promising beginnings. </p> <p> Similarly, his boasts in yesterday's Sunday Times that he plans to engage the Daily Express in head-to-head combat with the Daily Mail, emulate its most famous owner, Lord Beaverbrook, and become a billionaire ring particularly hollow. Too much has been made of his singular celebrity magazine success. Former OK! editor Sharon Ring says: \"He was very clever to see that Hello! had lost the plot and could be overtaken by OK!, but I can't see the same happening with the Express and the Mail.\" </p> <p>Indeed, there is a great deal of naivety about Desmond's initial statements. He may have, as everyone keeps saying, tremendous energy, enthusiasm and determination, but those are the very minimum requirements for a newspaper proprietor. However wide he opens his chequebook, the Mail can afford to spend more if necessary. Celebrity pictures may sell, but does he think the Mail doesn't know that? Newspapers are different from niche magazines. They must ration their entertainment content, ensuring that they do not lose their credibility. The Mail's success depends on its editor, Paul Dacre, following his instinct about how to strike a balance. </p> <p>If Boycott departs, Desmond will need to find an editor who really understands national papers. There have been suggestions that either the former Daily Record and Scotsman editor, Martin Clarke, or the ex-News of the World editor, Phil Hall, would be in the running. Ian Monk, one-time deputy editor and now handling Desmond's PR, might be in with a chance. Martin Dunn, the former Today and New York Daily News editor, should also be considered. </p> <p>The important factor would, of course, be the relationship between editor and owner. Desmond comes across as a Maxwellian figure, having shown an enthusiasm for intervening in the editorial affairs of OK!. He is also notoriously offensive, using the F-word frequently. At his first dinner in a Chinese restaurant with the Express and Star editors and deputies, he tipped back in his chair, took a cigar from his mouth and said: \"Well, this is fucking brilliant, fucking great!\" </p> <p>He can be charming, said one of his former executives, but \"he is a ruthless man, driven by money and status\". Since he is already a multimillionaire at 48, it may be the latter that has compelled Desmond to become a newspaper tycoon. But it's unclear whether he will find a warm welcome in Downing Street. He says he is a socialist and a pro-European, makes much of Tony Blair as \"a businesslike prime minister who's doing a good job\", and disparages William Hague. </p> <p>For all that, he has let it be known that he regards the Express as \"too leftwing\". What he probably means is that it tends to wear its heart on its sleeve, criticising the government over pensions, for instance. Again, this doesn't sound too hopeful for Boycott's future. I have a hunch that she would have walked on Friday but for her genuine respect for her favoured staff. She doesn't want to feel she is abandoning them. </p> <p>She was none too pleased with Desmond's demand that the 40-strong OK! editorial team should be quartered on the same floor as the Daily Express. That move was still being resisted at the weekend by Express executives citing health and safety regulations. </p> <p>Another bizarre consequence of the takeover is the appointment of Stan Myerson as advertising director. He left the Express under a cloud some years ago. Now he is in charge of a department which includes people who sat on the disciplinary panel which led to him being fired. His ex-wife also works on the paper. </p> <p>All in all, the prospects for the Express titles still look gloomy. In recent years it was common for Express journalists to say that \"anyone would be better than Hollick\". There aren't many saying that now.</p>",

Her background as a founder of the ground-breaking feminist magazine, Spare Rib, and her continuing adherence to its principles, cannot be squared with those of Desmond, whom she regards as an exploiter of women. She will not be mollified by the reply to this last point by one of Desmond's lieutenants. \"We don't exploit them,\" he explained. \"The girls get paid.\" Anyway, Desmond is intent on distancing himself from the activities that created his considerable personal fortune. \"We do not publish pornography,\" he told the Sunday Express yesterday, \"because pornography is illegal. We publish adult magazines.\" Semantics aside - dictionary definitions of pornography refer to it as a descriptive word in which legality plays no part - there is no doubt that Desmond's top-shelf magazines, along with Television X and the Fantasy Channel, are his major source of revenue. He may have hived them off into a separate company but there can be no doubt that, for the foreseeable future, the Daily Express will be funded by soft porn. There is, of course, a positive side. In four days Desmond has shown more interest in the papers than Hollick showed in four years, even circulating a morale-boosting memo of praise on Friday. He has increased the print run by more than 250,000 copies a day, and launched a \u00a31m TV promotion campaign based on the slogan \"It's OK! at the Express\". He says he will release big money for book serialisations and buy-ups. He will also axe four unprofitable internet sites this week, diverting the saved \u00a38m into the papers. He has enthused Daily Star editor Peter Hill, pledging a tie-up with his Fantasy Channel, though I'm uncertain whether a plunge downmarket by the Star will work: it has done better since it became less tacky. Nor do I think Desmond's supposed plan to launch a Sunday Star too clever. These are not promising beginnings. Similarly, his boasts in yesterday's Sunday Times that he plans to engage the Daily Express in head-to-head combat with the Daily Mail, emulate its most famous owner, Lord Beaverbrook, and become a billionaire ring particularly hollow. Too much has been made of his singular celebrity magazine success. Former OK! editor Sharon Ring says: \"He was very clever to see that Hello! had lost the plot and could be overtaken by OK!, but I can't see the same happening with the Express and the Mail.\" Indeed, there is a great deal of naivety about Desmond's initial statements. He may have, as everyone keeps saying, tremendous energy, enthusiasm and determination, but those are the very minimum requirements for a newspaper proprietor. However wide he opens his chequebook, the Mail can afford to spend more if necessary. Celebrity pictures may sell, but does he think the Mail doesn't know that? Newspapers are different from niche magazines. They must ration their entertainment content, ensuring that they do not lose their credibility. The Mail's success depends on its editor, Paul Dacre, following his instinct about how to strike a balance. If Boycott departs, Desmond will need to find an editor who really understands national papers. There have been suggestions that either the former Daily Record and Scotsman editor, Martin Clarke, or the ex-News of the World editor, Phil Hall, would be in the running. Ian Monk, one-time deputy editor and now handling Desmond's PR, might be in with a chance. Martin Dunn, the former Today and New York Daily News editor, should also be considered. The important factor would, of course, be the relationship between editor and owner. Desmond comes across as a Maxwellian figure, having shown an enthusiasm for intervening in the editorial affairs of OK!. He is also notoriously offensive, using the F-word frequently. At his first dinner in a Chinese restaurant with the Express and Star editors and deputies, he tipped back in his chair, took a cigar from his mouth and said: \"Well, this is fucking brilliant, fucking great!\" He can be charming, said one of his former executives, but \"he is a ruthless man, driven by money and status\". Since he is already a multimillionaire at 48, it may be the latter that has compelled Desmond to become a newspaper tycoon. But it's unclear whether he will find a warm welcome in Downing Street. He says he is a socialist and a pro-European, makes much of Tony Blair as \"a businesslike prime minister who's doing a good job\", and disparages William Hague. For all that, he has let it be known that he regards the Express as \"too leftwing\". What he probably means is that it tends to wear its heart on its sleeve, criticising the government over pensions, for instance. Again, this doesn't sound too hopeful for Boycott's future. I have a hunch that she would have walked on Friday but for her genuine respect for her favoured staff. She doesn't want to feel she is abandoning them. She was none too pleased with Desmond's demand that the 40-strong OK! editorial team should be quartered on the same floor as the Daily Express. That move was still being resisted at the weekend by Express executives citing health and safety regulations. Another bizarre consequence of the takeover is the appointment of Stan Myerson as advertising director. He left the Express under a cloud some years ago. Now he is in charge of a department which includes people who sat on the disciplinary panel which led to him being fired. His ex-wife also works on the paper. All in all, the prospects for the Express titles still look gloomy. In recent years it was common for Express journalists to say that \"anyone would be better than Hollick\". There aren't many saying that now.",

      "body": "<p>Sumerian. Mesopota-mian. Byzantine. The politics of the British Museum have long been as arcane as this august institution's labyrinth of stuffed galleries. But in recent months, the vicious carping surrounding the construction of the museum's magnificent new Great Court has been less the stuff of ancient civilisations than fodder for tabloid headlines. Great bitching in the Great Court. </p> <p>The reason is the row over who is to blame for the \u00a3100m lottery-fuelled project falling into disfavour with English Heritage because the wrong sort of stone was used on the south facade of the Great Court. A new Ionic portico, the principal gateway to the two-acre Great Court, has been erected here to replace an original demolished 125 years ago. The contractor supplied a couple of thousand tons of Anstrude Roche Claire limestone for the task, instead of good old Portland stone. The former is French and, therefore, in the eyes of the Heritage chaps, a bad thing. There have been tantrums and calls for resignations in the exquisite halls of one of the most popular museums in the world. </p> <p>No doubt something a little dodgy has been going on somewhere along the line between the French quarries and Bloomsbury but, for visitors to the Great Court, this storm in a wine goblet will mean little if anything. In 10 years, few will know or care what all the fuss was for. What they will know, instead, is one of the most extraordinary covered squares to be found in any city, ancient or modern. </p> <p>Designed by Foster and Partners and engineered by Buro Happold, the Great Court is the largest covered square in Europe. Entered from the controversial portico, it takes the breath away. It is not just the scale of what has, for nearly 150 years, been Britain's most secret courtyard that takes the visitor aback. It is the almost surreal effect of seeing the former Reading Room - the haunt of Marx and Mumford, Ruskin and Rossetti, Yeats and Sun Yat-Sen - looking quite so small in this Brobdingnagian space. At 140ft in diameter, the dome of Sydney Smirke's Reading Room is just 2ft smaller than that mother of all domes, the Pantheon in the heart of Rome. Here, though, surrounded by the restored Portland stone walls of Robert Smirke's chaste Grecian courtyard, and under the billowing new Foster/Happold glass roof, the younger Smirke's famous library seems almost dwarfed. </p> <p>This astonishing sight reminds me of Piranesi's daunting engraved vision of the Temple of Vesta (from his book, Prima Parte, 1762); here a great circular Corinthian temple appears to be growing up inside a much larger Pantheon-style temple. Citizens in togas mounting the stairs that wrap around the temple-within-a-temple seem quite dwarfed: as in Piranesi's imaginary ancient Rome, so in contemporary Bloomsbury. </p> <p>This extraordinary telescoping of space really is an odd experience; it's rather like being Gulliver on his travels. Step inside the painstakingly restored Reading Room with its distinctive cartwheel of 35 long desks and, far from being small, it feels immense - which it is. The Great Court truly lives up to its name. This newly excavated and brilliantly remodelled courtyard is likely to become one of the most popular, and certainly the busiest, meeting places in London this side of the concourses of Waterloo and Victoria stations. </p> <p>Even then, what you see walking under the curved, crisscross-patterned glass roof of the Great Court, through which Sydney Smirke's copper dome blooms voluptuously into the London cloudscape, is only a small part of the huge reconstruction that has taken place behind the walls of the British Museum in just 33 months and without the building having to close to its teeming public. Below the new courtyard floor are new lecture theatres and study rooms: Smirke's Reading Room is truly the tip of an architectural iceburg. It is also the hub around which visitors will trace new routes through the museum and where they will find an intriguing new cafe that wraps around the drum of the Reading Room and is approached by stone stairs (the Heritage chaps will have to avoid these; they're made of Galicia Capri limestone from Spain, a foreign country) that echo those of Piranesi's Temple of Vesta. </p> <p>The Reading Room at the centre of the Great Court thus becomes the new heart of this cultural behemoth. This helps visitors to the museum enormously. To date, because of the museum's linear plan, they have had to retrace their tracks several times to get from one gallery to another. From next week, when the Great Court opens, they will be able to criss-cross the museum, making new cultural connections and stopping under the great glass roof for a break. During museum opening hours, the Great Court will also act as the centre of a pedestrian route from north to south across Bloomsbury through the museum: handy on a wet day. </p> <p>The roof of the Great Court is a triumph. Foster is not the first archi tect to come up with plans for a glass roof here. In 1852, just two years after the completion of Robert Smirke's grand Greek Revival design, Charles Barry, joint architect of the Palace of Westminster, proposed roofing over the courtyard - then a garden - with sheets of glass supported on 50 iron pillars. This new space, inspired by Paxton's Crystal Palace of the year before, was to have served as a Hall of Antiquities. </p> <p>It never happened, largely because the Reading Room did. This opened in 1857. Together with its attendant book stacks, it filled in the courtyard which then disappeared from public view, until now. Most of the tens of millions who have pushed and shoved their way from the Egyptian mummies to the last sad pages of Captain Scott's manuscript diary will have had no idea that the biggest space of all in the museum - 40% of the entire museum site - was entirely hidden from them. </p> <p>It was freed up again when the British Library finally moved to its new premises up the road on the old Somers Town goods yard site at Kings Cross in 1998. Glazing over the courtyard was no doddle. For whatever reason, Smirke minor positioned the drum and dome of his reading room some way off centre. As a consequence, the geometry of the Foster/Happold roof is complex. And yet it looks effortless, a gently billowing cloud of almost ethereal geometric steel and glass contrasting elegantly with the British (hurrah), French (shame) and Spanish (poor show) stone of the classical architecture and statuary below. The antique sculpture on display in the Great Court will be joined by Anish Kapoor's stainless steel eyecatcher titled Turning the World Upside Down. This tall, mirror-like sculpture is set in front of the entrance to the Reading Room on an axis with the controversial south portico. It promises to play a clever and delightful game with the immensely grand, if not solemn, architecture and mesmerising geometry of the Great Court. </p> <p>Schemes for remodelling and extending the British Museum and rehousing the British Library date back many years. Yet, by waiting the best part of 40 years, the Museum appears to have done the right thing. Earlier plans would have meant a big new British Library building in the heart of Bloomsbury and the destruction of the dense old streetscape Robert Smirke's chaste masterpiece inhabits. </p> <p> Instead, with the British Library removed to a daunting brick palazzo a few hundred yards to the north, we can enjoy Smirke at his best. While the Great Court has been remodelled, the Regency interiors have been restored to their original decorative scheme. We can enjoy, too, the old streets here that act as a chatterbox backdrop to the silent screen of Ionic columns (based on those of the temple of Athena Polias at Priene in Asia Minor) that have characterised the BM for the past 150 years. </p> <p>Foster won the Great Court commission in 1993 after an open competition entered by 132 firms of architects worldwide. While work was in progress in Bloomsbury, he was also at work on the reconstruction of the Reichstag, the new seat of the German parliament, in Berlin. This, too, consists of a grand classical building (although not nearly as refined as Smirke's) topped with a huge dome. </p> <p>The heart of both these great civic statements are now open to their respective publics. The way in which we are learning to open some of our greatest, yet far too often most secret, buildings to the public is encouraging. There are many more to come, yet as we begin to uncover and reveal these secret worlds, we will involve an increasing number of people in an intelligent discussion of how we might nurture our architectural heritage. In the design of the Great Court, Foster and his team have shown how the design of one era can be enhanced by that of another. </p> <p>When the bitching stops and the petty emporers of our Byzantine cultural establishment put away their sharp, ambitious knives, the public en masse will see just how great the Great Court is.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Great Court at the British Museum, London WC1, opens December 7.

      "body": "<p>Soldiers are being maimed and killed because of medical blunders by Army doctors, The Observer can reveal. The scale of the problem has led to record compensation payouts. </p> <p>Since 1998 the Ministry of Defence has paid out more than \u00a320 million to 191 members of the armed forces, more than \u00a311,500 a year for each doctor employed in the Defence Medical Services. </p> <p>The total compensation has trebled since 1997 and is now six times higher than in the National Health Service, which last year paid out less than \u00a32,000 per doctor. </p> <p>For \u00a320m the MoD could have refurbished all the homes on a military base, upgraded 50,000 of its rifles or bought 10 Challenger battle tanks. </p> <p>Legal experts believe the rapidly dwindling number of medical specialists in the armed forces is one reason for the soaring number of medical blunders, with late and wrong diagnosis a major problem. The Defence Medical Services are losing more than 700 trained doctors, nurses and specialists a year. </p> <p>Two years ago, father-of-three Stephen Stewart died after developing skin cancer during a tour of duty in Belize with the former Queen's Own Highlanders Regiment. </p> <p>After suffering from severe sunburn, a mole on his neck began to bleed. An Army doctor confirmed the growth was malignant and it was surgically removed. Stewart was then given the all-clear, but after leaving the Army in 1997 he began to have pains in his neck, suffered a dramatic weight loss and began vomiting regularly. </p> <p>Doctors confirmed the cancer had returned and told him he had less than a year to live. His widow, Paula Stewart, is suing the MoD, claiming her husband was not given radiotherapy treatment after the cancer first appeared. Lawyers say that this amounted to a crucial lapse in care that would have prevented his premature death. </p> <p>Lesley Herbertson, head of clinical negligence at law firm Alexander Harris, claims that there is anecdotal evidence of soldiers being made to feel 'weak' if they complain of health problems. </p> <p>Herbertson has recently acted for a young soldier who had been complaining of chest problems that made it difficult for him to breathe. His medical unit dismissed his complaints and did not take a chest X-ray. Days later he collapsed and was rushed to hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and required a major operation to save his life. The soldier was left with massive scars around his body and the MoD had to pay out \u00a320,000 in compensation. </p> <p>In another case, a soldier collapsed into a coma and was left with brain damage after being forced to go on a long run despite complaining of breathing difficulties. It turned out he had pleurisy. </p> <p>Families of soldiers are also having problems. Last July a Wiltshire family won more than \u00a32m in damages from the MoD after Army doctors in Aldershot failed to carry out a prompt Caesarean birth. The baby was left with cerebral palsy and cannot speak. </p> <p>Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on defence, said: 'Those joining the armed services are entitled to expect the best when it comes to medical treatment. Without a proper standard of care, units could easily be left well short of their full complement, adding to the burdens of overstretch. </p> <p>'The Defence Medical Services are still paying a heavy price for the cack-handed reforms introduced under the last Conservative Government. But it is time the present administration put things right.' </p> <p>Earlier this year Admiral Sir John Brigstocke sparked a political row by writing of his concern about the 'parlous state' of the forces' medical service, complaining that the budget for the Surgeon-General's Department, which treats service personnel, had been cut by \u00a31.5m. </p> <p>In February, the Armed Forces Pay Review Body described manning levels as 'critically low, particularly in the numbers of deployable medical officers'. Since the end of the Cold War in 1989, Britain's armed forces had been cut by a third, but the manpower strength of the Defence Medical Services had fallen by more than half. </p> <p>Last year the Commons Defence Select Committee reported a 30 per cent staff shortfall, with only 50 per cent of the necessary doctors and 75 per cent of the nurses.</p>",

Stewart was then given the all-clear, but after leaving the Army in 1997 he began to have pains in his neck, suffered a dramatic weight loss and began vomiting regularly. Doctors confirmed the cancer had returned and told him he had less than a year to live. His widow, Paula Stewart, is suing the MoD, claiming her husband was not given radiotherapy treatment after the cancer first appeared. Lawyers say that this amounted to a crucial lapse in care that would have prevented his premature death. Lesley Herbertson, head of clinical negligence at law firm Alexander Harris, claims that there is anecdotal evidence of soldiers being made to feel 'weak' if they complain of health problems. Herbertson has recently acted for a young soldier who had been complaining of chest problems that made it difficult for him to breathe. His medical unit dismissed his complaints and did not take a chest X-ray. Days later he collapsed and was rushed to hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and required a major operation to save his life. The soldier was left with massive scars around his body and the MoD had to pay out \u00a320,000 in compensation. In another case, a soldier collapsed into a coma and was left with brain damage after being forced to go on a long run despite complaining of breathing difficulties. It turned out he had pleurisy. Families of soldiers are also having problems. Last July a Wiltshire family won more than \u00a32m in damages from the MoD after Army doctors in Aldershot failed to carry out a prompt Caesarean birth. The baby was left with cerebral palsy and cannot speak. Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on defence, said: 'Those joining the armed services are entitled to expect the best when it comes to medical treatment. Without a proper standard of care, units could easily be left well short of their full complement, adding to the burdens of overstretch. 'The Defence Medical Services are still paying a heavy price for the cack-handed reforms introduced under the last Conservative Government. But it is time the present administration put things right.' Earlier this year Admiral Sir John Brigstocke sparked a political row by writing of his concern about the 'parlous state' of the forces' medical service, complaining that the budget for the Surgeon-General's Department, which treats service personnel, had been cut by \u00a31.5m. In February, the Armed Forces Pay Review Body described manning levels as 'critically low, particularly in the numbers of deployable medical officers'. Since the end of the Cold War in 1989, Britain's armed forces had been cut by a third, but the manpower strength of the Defence Medical Services had fallen by more than half. Last year the Commons Defence Select Committee reported a 30 per cent staff shortfall, with only 50 per cent of the necessary doctors and 75 per cent of the nurses.",

      "body": "<p>Can there be anything less sexy than what happens after sex? The guddling through ashtrays, the naked traipse through to a grim kitchen to put the kettle on, the furtive binning of the condom, the twilight, the recriminations and, according to one's circumstances, the resumption of telly or the guilty phone call or the long awkward drive back to the zoo. And, for the past two decades, and least sexily of all, people getting very ill, and then very ill indeed, and then dying. </p> <p>This is less sexy now - in the sense in which the word's been shanghai'd by commercial marketing types - than any other kind of dying. In a definitive recent survey of 24 different health charities, and the public's willingness to give to them, Aids charities expected to come below the popular killers, your cancer and hearts and strokes. They didn't necessarily expect to come absolutely last, somewhere after goitre research and chlamydia relief. </p> <p>So Nick Partridge, chief executive of the newly merged Terrence Higgins Trust and London Lighthouse project, Britain's Mr Aids, is perhaps the least cynical man in the country about Prince Charles's much-publicised visit last week to the Lighthouse hospice, where he cuddled babies and chatted to HIV positive mothers and invoked the memory of Diana. The Prince received plenty of welcome publicity, of course - though Nick insists he was 'absolutely genuinely interested in what was going on with Aids - as, to be honest, any father of teenage children in Britain today should be.' But Nick and his staff and patients got their names and pictures on the front pages too, and jumped at the chance: for this is Britain's forgotten charity. Stupidly, needlessly forgotten: for there are, today, more HIV positive people in Britain than at any time before. </p> <p>Nick explains the problem as he sits in Oxford Street's Selfridges organising determined-looking volunteers into the drizzle for a day of bin-rattling ('Selfridges have been very good to us. They've got a good corporate policy. Also, bluntly, they've got a lot of gay staff.') He is a very well-preserved 45, easy to smile and slow, these days at least, to anger. </p> <p>The problem's simple. The drugs do work. Aids is no longer the genuinely terrifying gorgon it was in the Eighties and early Nineties. Since CT - combination therapy - was introduced experimentally a few years ago to treat HIV, it has proved astonishingly good at saving lives. 'Since 1996/97, the number of people dying from Aids has dropped by 70 per cent,' Nick explains. </p> <p>'What that's meant is phenomenal. There are all the changes in our services, of course. We teach people to readjust to expect to live, rather than teaching them to plan to die. And many lives have been saved. But what it also means is - ' he sighs - 'a huge complacency. It is still such a problem. It is still transmissible. People still die. But we have to raise \u00a38m a year to keep these charities going, and yet, because of the generational thing, and prejudice, people will always leave their money to animals, or children, a long long time before they leave it to us.' </p> <p>I ask about the swiftness of the new mood. Can he remember actually feeling a sea-change in the battle against Aids, a new hope? </p> <p>'Absolutely. It was at the International Aids Conference in Vancouver in 1996, the one that heralded the combination therapy revolution. Being an American/Canadian event, they were deliberately, relentlessly upbeat - there had to be good news every day. But that didn't stop me suddenly realising there genuinely was something new. I'd been involved with Aids work since 1983 - 13 years, in which there was so much, death, illness, loss and grief. Suddenly, after all that, being able to dare to be at all optimistic, even though we were cautious, it was such a joy. </p> <p>'For me, however, it was also tinged with sadness. At the same time as the CT news was breaking, one of my colleagues, Paul, who managed the hardship fund, was dying back here in London. He was 31. He died on the final day of conference; the first thing I had to do when I returned here was to lead his funeral. So the renewed hope that combination therapy has given to so many people will always for me be coloured with the memory of those who died.' </p> <p>The last Aids-related funeral he went to was in early 1998. Before that, he was at about one a month. The change is 'unimaginable, even five years ago'. But the drugs won't cure everyone - about 500 will still die this year in Britain - and infection is on the increase once more. </p> <p>'One of the main barriers is the number of people who won't get tested, even though they suspect they might be positive - they'll be diagnosed too late and the drugs can only halt decline by then, they can't rebuild the immune system.' Today, he added, one of the two communities most affected - gay men and drug-injectors - is much safer, as the shared-needle epidemic has been largely contained, 'thanks to good public health, needle exchanges and the rest. </p> <p>'But there is real concern at the increase in new infections among young gay men. It's hard to know exactly what the figures are, but I think I know why it's happening. Remember that we're 19 years into this: an 18-year-old man now coming out and exploring his sexuality was only one or two years old when our screens were filled with the iceberg campaign. </p> <p>'But it's not just young people's ignorance: for older generations now, with the new drugs, there's a sense of wanting to try to forget, to forget the years of difficulty and misery and death. Some will behave as if they have forgotten. And, put bluntly, whether it's ignorance or complacency, both of them still kill. There are about 30,000 people in Britain today living with HIV, but only 20,000 of them know they have it. </p> <p>'I do know, of course, that being tested is still such a difficult thing to do.' (Has he been tested? 'I don't really want to talk about my own health.') 'You can have it done much faster, within a day, but the result can still devastate, even with these drugs. And there is that whole horrible thing of having to think who you may have infected, and contact them - that's what makes this so different to any other fatal illness.' </p> <p>There is, I seem to feel from him, a real and vicious anger against the virus: against its suddenness, its capriciousness, the personal devastation it has had on too many friends. He nods, quietly. 'And it's also been a useful touchstone, if you like, against prejudice. There are those who have always had difficulties with gay men and drug users and sex and death, and black Africans' - for this last class, he has explained, is the other group among whom the virus is still raging: on a recent visit to QuaZulu/Natal he found 25 per cent of the adult population were infected. 'The success of the drugs has, if you like, given them new permission to ignore these things.' </p> <p>He is still worried, he admits, even now at this late stage, of a backlash against gay men: and worried, too, 'that we might still lose against this very stupid virus.' </p> <p>Stupid? </p> <p>'Well, you're right, it is just a virus. It just goes where it is allowed to go. But, actually, yes, I do hate it. I try not to personalise it, but it's hard not to hate. And it is stupid: it has its own inbuilt defect, which is that it has to mutate - so the question, over the next few years, is whether pharmaceutical companies can keep up with its mutations: it's a race.' </p> <p>But it's a race, he says more calmly, 'without that early Eighties sense of panic. Which is good. As long as we don't get something equally dangerous - the complacency that might take its place.' </p> <p>\u0095 Terrence Higgins Trust: tel 0207 831 0330; <br><a href=\"http://www.tht.org.uk\">Terrence Higgins Trust</a></p> <p>\u0095 World Aids Day is on 1 December</p>",

It is what Volvo built its reputation upon. The cars tended accordingly to look like crates. There is no vehicle in existence so thumpingly square as an old Volvo estate, unless it is an articulated lorry. </p> <p>Recently, though, the company has brought us the V70 Cross Country - an amazingly smooth, all- terrain estate car that doesn't look like a Portacabin on wheels. And now here's the Volvo S60, nudging its way into the crowded executive saloon sector, but doing so with rounded shoulders rather than with hulking great elbows. </p> <p>The S60 is designed to lure the fans of the BMW 3 series, the C-class Mercedes and the Audi A4. Up to a point, it plays those rivals at their own game - the continuous, softly flowing lines from boot to headlamp, the sporty tilt - but then it adds a couple of twists that are strictly Volvo, namely the sober attention to slightly grey, practical matters such as space and safety. </p> <p>The boot, for instance, seems to have been designed to accommodate a small guest house. The interior is, similarly, created with roominess in mind - and, by extension, with elegance somewhere further down the list. And - having a reputation to live up to - the car positively bristles with airbags and anti-roll bars and anti-shatter curtains, all of which are invisible and yet whose presence is somehow felt in the vehicle's tangible atmosphere of studious good sense. There isn't a single part of this car, one feels, that won't, upon impact, produce an abruptly inflating safety device. It's a balloon festival waiting to happen. </p> <p>As a result, the S60 carves itself a niche - a deep, safe one. It's considerably less ostentatious than the Mercedes, altogether less wide-boy than the BMW, and nowhere near as discreet as the prince of this sector, the Audi A4. And though it's slopey and rounded, it's most definitely a big lump of Sweden, from its \"egg-crate\" grille (Volvo's own description), right the way back to those almost comically vast rear-light mouldings. One morning you will wake up and those brake lights will have carried out their plan, which is to take over the whole car. </p> <p>Actually, they may have to fight for supremacy with the front doors, which also seem to have their sights set on total domination. The doors are apparently adapted from the openings to a meat locker. At any rate, nothing else would appear to explain their breadth, thickness and weight. Volvo describe these doors as one of the car's reassuring features, maintaining that they enhance, by their sheer heft, your sense of ease within the car. This can't really be denied, though at the same time, the doors - opened wide into traffic - would appear to increase your scope for maiming a passing cyclist by, I calculate, 15%. Clearly, one man's safety is another man's visit to casualty. </p> <p>Once you've closed the door and got your breath back, however, you will soon be twisting the key and noting the following coming from the engine: absolutely nothing. Ticking over, the engine works at a whisper. The whisper of a very shy person indeed. On one occasion, forgetting that I had already started the car, and hearing nothing whatsoever coming from the engine to contradict this impression, I turned the key in the ignition for a second time. (Now, then you do hear an interesting noise. But this is not recommended practice in any of the manuals.) Numerous other times, before pulling away, I found myself, in a slightly neurotic manner, depressing the accelerator in order simply to provoke a response from the engine and prove to myself that the thing was alive and well. </p> <p>At speed, the engine noise rises from a whisper to a barely audible murmur. I have only rarely heard an engine so quiet. Or rather, not heard one. And it was in cars at least three times the price of the S60. It should be noted, however, that almost total silence from an engine does have its drawbacks. Though clearly excellent news for anyone intent on carefully exploring the capacity of the car's stereo, the absence of audible information from under the bonnet makes those reckless acts of speeding, which are almost inevitable in a compact executive saloon, far harder to curb, or even notice. You can be up to 50 in an S60 before you know it, and certainly before you hear about it. </p> <p>And thus one wafts along in silence, in a car that feels so well bolted-together that no vibration could ever loosen it. And somehow one feels better bolted-together, as a person, for driving it. Meanwhile, one's on-board pleasure is enhanced by the usual range of flattering devices. The pricier variants of the S60 offer a satellite navigation screen which rises out of the top of the dash, like an organist coming through the floor of a cinema and which will doubtless provide the busy executive with bottomless amusement for at least a fortnight. And if the two cup-holders behind the gearstick aren't enough for you, you can pop another one out of the dashboard - an unprecedented provision, I think, but not the only thing about the S60 that would qualify as a surprise. </p> <p><strong> The lowdown</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Volvo S60 </strong></p> <p><strong> Price:</strong> from \u00a319,995</p> <p><strong> Top speed:</strong> 140 mph </p> <p><strong> Acceleration:</strong> 0-62 in 8.8 seconds </p> <p><strong> Consumption:</strong> 30.7 mpg combined </p> <p><strong> At the wheel:</strong> Steve Rider </p> <p><strong> On the stereo:</strong> Bryan Ferry </p> <p><strong> En route for:</strong> The Golf Warehouse</p>",

The federal government today announced an aid package worth up to A$100m (\u00a337m) to help the farmers.</p> <p>But there has been no attempt by Australia's political classes to link the catastrophic floods to global warming and question the government's responsibility for the latter.</p> <p>The irony that the floods came in the week that the Hague summit subsided has gone unmentioned in mainstream political debate.</p> <p>Environment groups are not surprised: Australia's right-wing government lined up alongside the US and Canada at the Hague in demanding the right to continue dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in exchange for planting forests as carbon sinks.</p> <p>In part, however, the failure to link global warming to the latest floods is simply because Australians are far more familiar with natural disasters and extreme weather conditions than Europeans.</p> <p>The country is susceptible to a cycle of floods and droughts caused by the El Nino weather system.</p> <p>So, although the miles and miles of ravaged crops are the worst disaster to hit agriculture for 20 years, most farmers and politicians see nothing new in them.</p> <p>For generations, they have battled to tame the bush, as the 100-year old ruins of farms across Western Australia, where farmers gave up their precarious settlements, are testimony to.</p> <p>For many, the latest floods are the third successive season in which heavy rain has hit their yields.</p> <p>But the absence of global warming from the floods debate is also because of the government has a better bogeyman to blame - Australia's banks.</p> <p>Mr Howard led the charge against Australia's big four banks at the weekend, telling them they have a \"moral obligation\" to help out farmers. </p> <p>His government's aid package is generous, but it is feared that it much of it will simply offset farmers existing debts, rather than help them plant new crops and repair damaged land.</p> <p>In the last financial year, Australia's main four banks made A$9.2bn (\u00a33.4bn) profit. So far, just one bank has donated $100,000 (\u00a337,000) directly to the relief effort.</p> <p>They have offered some concessions to the farmers. The Australian Bankers' Association has said that banks will waive fees on new loans, while ANZ bank has agreed to a 12-month freeze on the repayment of loans (although not on the interest on those loans).</p> <p>Other banks are promising to help \"restructure\" farmers' debts. \"Repayment\" is not on their lips yet.</p> <p>As in Britain, Australia's banks have also courted controversy recently with the widespread closure of rural branches. In some small towns, this means the nearest branch could be 100 miles away.</p> <p>Internet banking remains a science fiction for many, while Australia's whopping bank fees have also incurred the wrath of consumer groups.</p> <p>With an election looming in the next 12 months, the federal government's popular crusade against the banks is politically crucial.</p> <p>Once again, there are significant parallels with the British experience. The government is sitting on a large budget surplus, courtesy of petrol taxes. </p> <p>But, because of the widespread hostility towards those taxes, its spending programmes - most recently, on flood relief and on rural roads - have failed to ignite any affection for the government.</p> <p>The Liberal government's fate will largely depend on the electoral choices of 1m voters who expressed their disillusionment with mainstream politics by backing Pauline Hanson's extreme right-wing One Nation party at the last election.</p> <p>They are likely to vote differently this time given that One Nation has imploded in scandal and infighting, leaving both the two main parties, Liberal and Labor, to pursue Ms Hanson's fans by aping elements of her agenda.</p> <p>The prime minister's populist bank bashing response to the floods recalls Ms Hanson's crusade against globalisation. His refusal to raise the issue of global warming is also a rejection of globalisation's ecological arm.</p> <p>If it wasn't so flooded, John Howard's head would be in the sand.</p> <p><strong>Email</strong><br> <a href=\"mailto:patrick.barkham@theguardian.com\">patrick.barkham@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>Related special reports</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/globalwarming\">Global warming</a><br></p> <p><strong>Other articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28patrick+barkham%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=patrick+barkham&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Patrick Barkham</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.nswfarmers.org.au/\">New South Wales farmers</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.affa.gov.au/\">Agriculture, fisheries and forestry Australia</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.acfonline.org.au\">Australian Conservation Foundation</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.greens.org.au/\">Australian Greens online</a><br><a href=\"http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/\">NSW Environmental Protection Agency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/\">Sydney Morning Herald</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/\">Australia Broadcasting Corporation</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/\">The Age</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.asiapulse.com/\">Asia Pulse</a></p>",

Australian farmers are a notoriously tough breed but, with more than $600m worth of crops lost, many have been reduced to tears, facing no income for another year and likely bankruptcy. Australia's prime minister, John Howard, said that the bush was \"down on its knees through no fault of its own\". The federal government today announced an aid package worth up to A$100m (\u00a337m) to help the farmers. But there has been no attempt by Australia's political classes to link the catastrophic floods to global warming and question the government's responsibility for the latter. The irony that the floods came in the week that the Hague summit subsided has gone unmentioned in mainstream political debate. Environment groups are not surprised: Australia's right-wing government lined up alongside the US and Canada at the Hague in demanding the right to continue dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in exchange for planting forests as carbon sinks. In part, however, the failure to link global warming to the latest floods is simply because Australians are far more familiar with natural disasters and extreme weather conditions than Europeans. The country is susceptible to a cycle of floods and droughts caused by the El Nino weather system. So, although the miles and miles of ravaged crops are the worst disaster to hit agriculture for 20 years, most farmers and politicians see nothing new in them. For generations, they have battled to tame the bush, as the 100-year old ruins of farms across Western Australia, where farmers gave up their precarious settlements, are testimony to. For many, the latest floods are the third successive season in which heavy rain has hit their yields. But the absence of global warming from the floods debate is also because of the government has a better bogeyman to blame - Australia's banks. Mr Howard led the charge against Australia's big four banks at the weekend, telling them they have a \"moral obligation\" to help out farmers. His government's aid package is generous, but it is feared that it much of it will simply offset farmers existing debts, rather than help them plant new crops and repair damaged land. In the last financial year, Australia's main four banks made A$9.2bn (\u00a33.4bn) profit. So far, just one bank has donated $100,000 (\u00a337,000) directly to the relief effort. They have offered some concessions to the farmers. The Australian Bankers' Association has said that banks will waive fees on new loans, while ANZ bank has agreed to a 12-month freeze on the repayment of loans (although not on the interest on those loans). Other banks are promising to help \"restructure\" farmers' debts. \"Repayment\" is not on their lips yet. As in Britain, Australia's banks have also courted controversy recently with the widespread closure of rural branches. In some small towns, this means the nearest branch could be 100 miles away. Internet banking remains a science fiction for many, while Australia's whopping bank fees have also incurred the wrath of consumer groups. With an election looming in the next 12 months, the federal government's popular crusade against the banks is politically crucial. Once again, there are significant parallels with the British experience. The government is sitting on a large budget surplus, courtesy of petrol taxes. But, because of the widespread hostility towards those taxes, its spending programmes - most recently, on flood relief and on rural roads - have failed to ignite any affection for the government. The Liberal government's fate will largely depend on the electoral choices of 1m voters who expressed their disillusionment with mainstream politics by backing Pauline Hanson's extreme right-wing One Nation party at the last election. They are likely to vote differently this time given that One Nation has imploded in scandal and infighting, leaving both the two main parties, Liberal and Labor, to pursue Ms Hanson's fans by aping elements of her agenda. The prime minister's populist bank bashing response to the floods recalls Ms Hanson's crusade against globalisation. His refusal to raise the issue of global warming is also a rejection of globalisation's ecological arm. If it wasn't so flooded, John Howard's head would be in the sand.

      "body": "<p><strong> What is it?</strong> A tomato-flavoured red gloop that has, for some reason, become the nation's favourite condiment. Heinz sells more than 120m bottles of the stuff in the UK every year. </p> <p><strong> So what's the problem?</strong> Well, nothing, really. Heinz Tomato Ketchup is the UK market leader with an impressive 58% share. But Heinz is not content with being popular - it wants to be cool as well. In fact, the food group has resolved to make its sauce \"as famous as Coca-Cola\". </p> <p><strong> And what is it doing about it? </strong> Launching a series of new labels bearing witty messages about the famous ketchup. The limited-edition bottles, available from the end of the month, look just like the real thing but carry lines such as Are Your French Fries Lonely? and Best Worn With Food. Sharon Ellis, category manager for Heinz Tomato Ketchup, says: \"Heinz Tomato Ketchup is cool and confident. As one of the world's leading brands, it deserves the chance to speak up and show what a great sense of humour it has.\" </p> <p><strong> Marketing</strong> : Heinz recently briefed its ad agencies to target teenagers without alienating the rest of the population. Earlier this year the company launched a \u00a330m global advertising campaign that played on the notoriously slow process of getting ketchup out of its bottle. \"Heinz Tomato Ketchup won't come out until it's ready,\" said an actor in one ad. \"No one knows what it does to get ready. It's not like it's putting on make-up or getting dressed, but it does seem to need some time.\" In July, Heinz announced plans to launch a green version of its ketchup in the US. The company expects the new sauce to be a hit on St Patrick's Day. </p> <p><strong> History:</strong> Heinz Tomato Ketchup was first made in 1876 in Pittsburgh. It arrived in the UK in 1886, when Fortnum and Mason began selling it, but it was not manufactured here until 1946. It achieved mass popularity in the late 1900s, when Henry J Heinz hit on the then novel idea of guaranteeing that his products did not contain artificial additives. It may be hard to believe, but Heinz's Ketchup has always been free of artificial colourings. </p> <p><strong> What about the competition:</strong> Daddies Ketchup has 6% of the market, the rest is own-label. </p> <p><strong> The future:</strong> Heinz caters for the fashion cognoscenti by launching black ketchup - the only colour to be seen eating.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What is it? A tomato-flavoured red gloop that has, for some reason, become the nation's favourite condiment. Heinz sells more than 120m bottles of the stuff in the UK every year. So what's the problem? Well, nothing, really. Heinz Tomato Ketchup is the UK market leader with an impressive 58% share. But Heinz is not content with being popular - it wants to be cool as well. In fact, the food group has resolved to make its sauce \"as famous as Coca-Cola\". And what is it doing about it? Launching a series of new labels bearing witty messages about the famous ketchup. The limited-edition bottles, available from the end of the month, look just like the real thing but carry lines such as Are Your French Fries Lonely? and Best Worn With Food. Sharon Ellis, category manager for Heinz Tomato Ketchup, says: \"Heinz Tomato Ketchup is cool and confident. As one of the world's leading brands, it deserves the chance to speak up and show what a great sense of humour it has.\" Marketing : Heinz recently briefed its ad agencies to target teenagers without alienating the rest of the population. Earlier this year the company launched a \u00a330m global advertising campaign that played on the notoriously slow process of getting ketchup out of its bottle. \"Heinz Tomato Ketchup won't come out until it's ready,\" said an actor in one ad. \"No one knows what it does to get ready. It's not like it's putting on make-up or getting dressed, but it does seem to need some time.\" In July, Heinz announced plans to launch a green version of its ketchup in the US. The company expects the new sauce to be a hit on St Patrick's Day. History: Heinz Tomato Ketchup was first made in 1876 in Pittsburgh. It arrived in the UK in 1886, when Fortnum and Mason began selling it, but it was not manufactured here until 1946. It achieved mass popularity in the late 1900s, when Henry J Heinz hit on the then novel idea of guaranteeing that his products did not contain artificial additives. It may be hard to believe, but Heinz's Ketchup has always been free of artificial colourings. What about the competition: Daddies Ketchup has 6% of the market, the rest is own-label. The future: Heinz caters for the fashion cognoscenti by launching black ketchup - the only colour to be seen eating.",

Mr Wall is rejoining Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media as chief operating officer and executive director from January 1.

These include business-to-business media outfit CMP Media, market research company NOP and PR Newswire. Mr Wall said: \"United has gone through an incredible transformation over the past year and now has a brilliant future as one of the UK's most exciting media companies.\" Mr Wall left Granada Media earlier this month after failing to find a suitable position within the company after the integration of United, which was sold to Granada Media. The company is being renamed United Business Media to reflect its new focus on business communications as opposed to TV and newspapers.

You have to sell the public a product that they usually moan about and in which they can rarely see any point. You have about two months to do it and only get one opportunity to buy every five years. The client will think they know how to do the job better than you and a significant part of the national media will deride your work. Want the job? Doesn't pay much, by the way. </p> <p>The new Labour poster campaign, based around the slogan \"If you voted for change in 1997 - thank you\", means that a May general election looks likely. The campaign has a touchy-feely feel. \"Over 450,000 infants in smaller classes. That's down to me.\" And \"I'm responsible for the lowest inflation for over 30 years.\" It's close to the Conservative Party's 1997 \"Yes it hurt. Yes it worked\" which sought to persuade us that the nation's weakness during a global downturn was part of their strategy for realigning the economy. </p> <p>This is unusual in Labour's history of advertising. Obviously, that is partly because a Labour government has rarely looked close to winning a second term at this stage in office. But it is also because of the party's relationship with the ad world. For a start, since its inception most of the party has thought of advertising as the very devil. The Labour party has also had very little money to spend on election campaigns, and has usually relied on volunteers from Soho. </p> <p>For much of the 80s the solution lay in the hands of the Shadow Communications Agency, a gang of creatives headed up by Chris Powell, the P in BMP. Powell himself has worked for the party since 1974. It was his agency, working on a conventional commercial basis for the first time, that steered the advertising campaign for the 1997 election. </p> <p>\"Actually, it was a bit of a nightmare,\" Powell says. \"It was incredibly hard work running an election campaign full-time from the agency and the commercial relationship meant that we were at the party's beck and call rather than doing everything on a favour basis. After the election, we asked if we could go back to the old way of doing things, but the party is happy with the commercial set-up so they recruited another agency for the next election.\" </p> <p>Since April, therefore, the party has placed its electoral life in the hands of Trevor Beattie and his agency TBWA as a result of a pitch overseen by Peter Mandelson. </p> <p>Beattie's media shorthand form is the man who invented Wonderbra's Hello Boys ads and also did the FCUK campaign for French Connection. Less widely known is his work for women's charities on domestic violence. Beattie's intention was to use the softly-softly stuff to counter allegations that the government is arrogant and out of touch and then to move up a gear as the election approaches. </p> <p>His preferred strategy is to counter public cynicism about politics by proving that not all parties are the same - the Tory party is worse than all the rest. \"Labour's record in government is phenomenal but people don't like bragging so it's better to run a negative campaign,\" he says. </p> <p>Over in Smith Square, the Tories are claiming that Labour's pre-pre-election campaign shows that the party is rattled. They claim the spend is roughly \u00a31m and that the Labour party gained poster sites when an advertiser pulled out to allow them in. That's something of a pot-and-kettle situation as the Conservative campaign of 1992 was boosted when Imperial Tobacco handed over poster sites to the Saatchis for use in the election. (Of course, one thing no one mentioned at the time is that the Labour government banned tobacco advertising was that it would also deny the Tories any similar assistance in the future.) </p> <p>There remains, however, something of a mystery over who the Conservatives will use to fight back against Beattie's blitz. Six months ago, the Newcastle and Edinburgh-based creative agency Yellow M landed the business. </p> <p>Now adland is filled with rumours. Three London agencies recently claimed they had been approached by the Tories but the party has dismissed rumours that chairman Michael Ancram is unhappy with the agency. </p> <p>The party says it has had positive feedback from Yellow M's October poster campaign which showed ordinary people feeling fed up with Labour under the strapline \"Is this what you voted for?\", in a eerie precursor to Beattie's campaign. Aside from this work, political analysts searching for a yardstick by which to measure Yellow M will have to look north of the border. </p> <p>Yellow M fought the Scottish parliament campaign using guerrilla tactics such as installing a bed of nails in a hotel room to protest at tourist taxes, depicting Alex Salmond on a poster as the Teletubby La-La, and perching David McLetchie, the Scottish Tory leader, on top of a crushed car to moan about car taxes. It may not be \"Labour isn't Working\", but Ancram says he believes that Yellow M has the drive to become the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi of the 21st century, pointing out that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was a young agency when it handled the Thatcher account. </p> <p>However, Yellow M will not have the advantages enjoyed by the Saatchis: the spending rules will have changed for the next election. In 1997, an astonishing \u00a330m was spent on political advertising, breaking down to \u00a37m spent by the Labour party, \u00a37m spent by the Referendum Party, \u00a33m by the Lib Dems and a whopping \u00a313m by the Tories. </p> <p>\"During the election, Maurice Saatchi basically told the Tories that they were in the shit but that if they gave him the money he could win the election for them,\" says one agency head. \"They called a lot of favours in from overseas and spent like mad with absolutely no discernible effects on the opinion polls whatsoever. That's one of the reasons the party split with the agency.\" </p> <p>It's also one of the reasons that this government acted to prevent such election spending ever happening again. The maximum any party can spend at a general election has been capped at \u00a35m - still far above the Lib Dems' peak but a considerable restriction on the Conservative party which has always tended to spend the greatest amount on advertising. None the less, Michael Ashcroft, the party treasurer, is trying to raise \u00a310m to fund the campaign.</p>",

      "body": "<p>How much longer can Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? dominate our screens and continue to capture the public's imagination? \"I don't know, I don't know,\" says Paul Smith, whose company, Celador, created the ITV series. \"There will come a point when people begin to tire of it. It's bound to plateau. I think it's there now - the highest audience was \u00a319.2m on a Sunday night 18 months ago . . . though it's being used differently by ITV now. Alan Yentob, BBC's director of drama and entertainment, described it as an Exocet missile. I don't say that with a sneer. It's virtually indestructible, but it won't last.\" </p> <p>Smith, a fit-looking 53-year-old dressed in trainers and jeans, is full of compressed but genial energy. His other enduring contribution to ITV is the comic clips veteran, It'll Be All Right on the Night. </p> <p>His office is at the top of a tall, thin townhouse in Long Acre, Covent Garden, where Celador and the ever-expanding team behind the show and its trail of merchandise are based. On the wall is a trophy, an amazing thing for British broadcasting, a framed Nielsen TV ratings chart for the week of February 9 2000, showing ABC's version of this British format taking the top four slots on American TV. </p> <p>So, did Smith cheat to make Judith Keppel the first person to hit the jackpot on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, destroying Victor Meldrew's last bow over on BBC? \"No, our producers don't cheat. No reason to. Truly, may I be struck down dead. Coincidence does take place.\" Keppel, he says, demonstrated what David Briggs, who devised most of the show's key features, always says: \"To be successful you have to know a little about a lot, not a lot about a little\" - the opposite of Mastermind. </p> <p>\"We've nothing to hide,\" Smith adds, opening up his desktop computer which holds the gritty details of every ITV Millionaire show - 122 to date. It logs the number of premium phonecalls made by contestants by day; the revenue raised (the cost of calls went up this autumn from 50p to 60p a minute); the prize money won in each programme - and the size of the remaining prize fund. And there's a stunning entry: after last Monday's \u00a31m win, ITV had to pay in \u00a31.5m first thing on Tuesday, to honour Keppel's cheque. </p> <p>On Monday as news of the win leaked, Celador received 138,000 calls, raising \u00a369,396 towards the prize fund. After 27 months on air, there have been 5.87m calls. Demand is down from the 300,000 callers for the first shows - hence the rise to 60p a minute - although that didn't stop one couple making 700 calls on a recent Sunday. So far the programme has paid out \u00a35.35m prize money, and ITV has paid in \u00a33.1m. The prize fund, post Keppel, stands at \u00a3407,000. \"The idea that ITV is creaming off money is offensive,\" says Smith. </p> <p>Celador has installed a permanent set at Elstree film studios and ITV pays a production fee of around \u00a3100,000 per edition. When the programme started, Smith said insurers were beating a path to Celador's door, and for a premium of \u00a340,000 a year they were able to insure themselves against several \u00a31m pound winners draining prize funds. Not now. Smith says the show became uninsurable before Keppel. In the US, there have been six millionaire winners, so the broadcaster claimed the money from the insurers making it uninsurable. (There have been other millionaire winners: one in Portugal, one in South Africa, two in France, one in Spain). \"There is a learning curve,\" observes Smith. \"The average [UK] winnings are higher than a year ago, by \u00a38,000. It was about \u00a348,000 per person this autumn, before the \u00a31m win. Now it's \u00a383,000.\" </p> <p>Is there a point at which the rise in winnings makes the show unsustainable? \"Yes, I'm sure there is. I don't know what it is. The cost of the show now (with the prize money) is nearing \u00a3200,000\" for ITV. But that is still cheaper than making an hour of original drama or comedy. The obvious ploy is to make the questions harder, so winnings fall, but that would ruin the accessible fun of it. \"There are a lot of serious players out there. It's the focus of their lives, like the lottery, but it's a game of skill, not luck. People making the calls, they really want to go into the chair, for a variety of reasons. </p> <p>\"I was at home watching TV when it [Keppel's win] happened, on Sunday. I was called by our head of entertainment, Colman Hutchinson, who said, 'There's a lady in the chair and she's going for \u00a31m, we know she's got it right. Do you want to stay on the line?' I said, 'No, enjoy the moment.'\" </p> <p>So what about the controversy over the timing of the win? \"Our figures are absolutely solid. The suggestion is that we had to [have a winner] because we wanted to beat the last edition of One Foot in the Grave. We were already beating them.\" </p> <p>But were the questions tailored? There were no questions for Keppel on sport. \"The simple answer is that it would be possible for us to choose questions, but we don't. But if we decided to, we could only make a value judgment based on someone we'd met a couple of hours before, and the likelihood that we would be successful in taking them through a route of 15 questions . . . well we'd be very clever to do so. Whatever happens, the rules are that the computer selects the 15 questions from 15 (out of 40) different categories, so the likelihood is that there will be a category you don't know anything about. It was not rigged at all. </p> <p>\"The point about Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? is that it doesn't use the conventions of quiz shows and game shows, where selection is the judgment of the producer or researcher. We're not allowed to. This is a competition people pay an entry fee to participate in. Everyone must be treated equally. When we conceived the show, we thought that would be a problem, but it's become a virtue. The wonderful thing is we do get such a diverse range of individuals. Some wonderful, some quite tedious. </p> <p>\"We used to get an incredible number of Scots in the first shows, while there were complaints that we had no one from Northern Ireland, and we're still low on ethnic minorities because they don't call. But at the end of the March series, we analysed the people who got through as the 10 finalists and then to the seat, and by a stroke of luck it followed a perfect pattern - it was totally representative regionally. It was luck because we can't engineer it.\" </p> <p>Is it destined to decline now that a million has been won? \"While someone hasn't won the money there is the anticipation that someone will. And as soon as someone has won it, there is the reaffirmation that, yes, it can be done. The \u00a31m prize has nothing to do with people watching, it's what I call the billboard, what attracts people initially. But if the substance of the show had been rubbish people would not have watched it, even if we gave away \u00a310m. People watch the show for the drama, the tension, and the enjoyment and security you have of sitting at home and shouting at the TV screen.\" </p> <p>ITV has changed the pattern this autumn, running the programme on average three nights a week for the past 10 weeks, and throwing it against BBC1's strongest programmes - EastEnders, Holby City and Casualty - while launching new dramas, such as Fat Friends, in its slipstream. It has averaged audiences of 11.7m, a 45.2% share, scant sign that it is going off the boil. \"We all considered and discussed the new scheduling pattern at great length. We had to be certain it didn't damage the format.\" </p> <p>Eighteen months ago Smith talked about the programme as a \"relative rarity\" and it was used as seven series of nightly stripped programmes. \"We always believed that was the only way the programme could achieve success. But we began to realise from evidence all over the world that you could play this programme in any scheduling pattern you want. It opened our eyes. There is no combination except seven days a week constantly when it didn't work - in Spain, it's six days a week, in the US four days a week, it's run over long weekends, been split either side of other programmes. So obviously ITV, who have a need to maximise their sales, audiences . . .\" </p> <p>That's how it's come to underpin the autumn schedules, with a Christmas special, and will continue into the new year. The format has been sold to 42 territories covering 80 countries. </p> <p>What does he think of the BBC hit, The Weakest Link? \"I don't want this to sound arrogant or smug . . . but The Weakest Link would never have been made if it had not been for Millionaire, never in that style. It's an OK gameshow. I don't think it's got enough jeopardy in it. I find it a little pedestrian, I'm not on the edge of the seat. It's not inspired. It's adequate.\" </p> <p>Can Celador ever follow up such a massive hit? This summer its sequel, The People Versus with Kirsty Young barely raised a squeak. \"We scored an own goal - it wasn't good enough,\" admits Smith. \"We were under pressure to deliver this to ITV and ABC and agreed to let it go. It got a 34% share. We've now completely reworked it, only the key things (the public set, the questions and the unlimited prize money) stay.\" It's being repiloted on ITV. </p> <p>What about selling out Celador at the top, to a bigger media company? No, says Smith. \"We would be inclined to resist all of these knocks. We enjoy our independence.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Steve Levine first realised something Very Strange Indeed was happening at 3.20pm on Thursday November 9. That was when he picked up the phone to be told by Stephen Budd, his manager: \"You've got an impostor.\" </p> <p>Levine, one of Britain's most successful record producers (he counts Culture Club, The Beach Boys and The Honeyz among his credits) didn't take it too seriously at first. \"We actually had a laugh about it,\" he says. \"It was only when I went back to work that the consequences began to sink in. That was when it got scary.\" </p> <p>At that stage, he knew only a few facts: a man, passing himself off as Steve Levine, had negotiated a production deal with a would-be pop star in America. It had all gone sour and the pop star's lawyers had taken up the cudgels on their client's behalf. They had tracked down (the real) Levine's manager in England. Hence that fateful phone call. </p> <p>That Thursday night was to be the first of several sleepless ones for Levine. After spending 14 hours on the phone to the States, a fuller picture had emerged. \"The guy had been wreaking havoc in my name,\" says Levine. \"It turned out he'd been introducing himself to several people in the business over there and trying to do deals with them. I'm almost certain he got money out of them. It seems he's left a trail of very important, very pissed off people behind him, who now think Steve Levine is a bullshitter and a fraud. He's in danger of destroying my career, my reputation: that's everything I've worked for over the past 25 years.\" </p> <p>Levine isn't exaggerating: if you're a record producer, your reputation is your most valuable asset. Big money deals are often signed on the basis of a producer's name alone. Levine's current project, for example, a young male duo called Hush, only came his way after someone recommended him to the boys' parents. They were impressed by Levine's reputation: he was a man they could trust. It's this reputation that the fake Levine has been exploiting: the worry now is that he may have destroyed it. </p> <p>Levine has the dubious distinction of being the first known victim of the newest form of cybercrime: identity snatching. It is a cunning and insidious variation on cyber squatting: unscrupulous net \"entrepreneurs\" buy the domain rights to famous people's names and then exploit them for financial gain. (Zo\u00eb Ball is a classic example: last year cyber squatters set up a website with mocked-up pornographic pictures of her on it.) </p> <p>But identity snatching is more sinister and more sophisticated than mere cyber squatting: the fraudsters aren't just taking their victims' names and images, they're stealing their entire personalities and careers. And people like Levine are particularly susceptible. This is because while their names and achievements may be well known within certain circles, their faces are not. Which means it's much easier for the fraudsters to get away with it. </p> <p>Levine is in no doubt that his impostor used the web as the basis of his deceit: \"My entire CV and career details were on three different websites,\" he says. \"All the bloke had to do was to type my name into a search engine, and he had it all there in front of him: everything he needed to know. There are things he's told people that he can only have learned from my details on the web.\" </p> <p>(The horse may have bolted but none the less, Levine has shut the stable door: he's removed his personal details from his own website, <a href=\"http://www.stevelevine.co.uk\">www.stevelevine.co.uk</a>, and replaced them with a contact address - <a href=\"mailto:info@record-producers.com\">info@record-producers.com</a> - and his picture.) </p> <p>What should worry well-known - but not famous - professionals everywhere, is the ease with which this scam was perpetrated; and the potentially catastrophic fallout it could entail. </p> <p>\"All I can do now is try and limit some of the damage he's caused, but it's going to be difficult,\" says a tired looking Levine. \"The music business, like most creative industries, runs on gossip: if one person out there is bad-mouthing me, and saying 'Don't touch Levine with a bargepole', then word soon gets round. Rumours are very powerful things, unfortunately.\" </p> <p>Levine, however, is fighting back, using the only weapons he has: words. \"I'm hoping this article will start tilting the balance back in my favour,\" he says. \"My impostor has been using cyberspace to get what he wants but I'm banking on good old- fashioned printed words to redress the balance.\" </p> <p>Defiant he may be, then, but Levine is also a little frightened: it is psychologically unsettling, to say the least, to know that someone has stolen your persona. And he is also concerned about practical issues. His legal bills are mounting up. Frustratingly, he knows the money could well turn out to be wasted. \"There's no guarantee that they'll catch this guy, and even if they do, it may be too late, in terms of the damage he's already done.\" </p> <p>Only one thing, he says, could cure the frustrating powerlessness he now feels. He would love to come face to face with his cyber alter ego on a dark night. \"Not very constructive I know: but it would make me feel a whole lot better.\"</p>",

It is a cunning and insidious variation on cyber squatting: unscrupulous net \"entrepreneurs\" buy the domain rights to famous people's names and then exploit them for financial gain. (Zo\u00eb Ball is a classic example: last year cyber squatters set up a website with mocked-up pornographic pictures of her on it.) But identity snatching is more sinister and more sophisticated than mere cyber squatting: the fraudsters aren't just taking their victims' names and images, they're stealing their entire personalities and careers. And people like Levine are particularly susceptible. This is because while their names and achievements may be well known within certain circles, their faces are not. Which means it's much easier for the fraudsters to get away with it. Levine is in no doubt that his impostor used the web as the basis of his deceit: \"My entire CV and career details were on three different websites,\" he says. \"All the bloke had to do was to type my name into a search engine, and he had it all there in front of him: everything he needed to know. There are things he's told people that he can only have learned from my details on the web.\" (The horse may have bolted but none the less, Levine has shut the stable door: he's removed his personal details from his own website, www.stevelevine.co.uk, and replaced them with a contact address - info@record-producers.com - and his picture.) What should worry well-known - but not famous - professionals everywhere, is the ease with which this scam was perpetrated; and the potentially catastrophic fallout it could entail. \"All I can do now is try and limit some of the damage he's caused, but it's going to be difficult,\" says a tired looking Levine. \"The music business, like most creative industries, runs on gossip: if one person out there is bad-mouthing me, and saying 'Don't touch Levine with a bargepole', then word soon gets round. Rumours are very powerful things, unfortunately.\" Levine, however, is fighting back, using the only weapons he has: words. \"I'm hoping this article will start tilting the balance back in my favour,\" he says. \"My impostor has been using cyberspace to get what he wants but I'm banking on good old- fashioned printed words to redress the balance.\" Defiant he may be, then, but Levine is also a little frightened: it is psychologically unsettling, to say the least, to know that someone has stolen your persona. And he is also concerned about practical issues. His legal bills are mounting up. Frustratingly, he knows the money could well turn out to be wasted. \"There's no guarantee that they'll catch this guy, and even if they do, it may be too late, in terms of the damage he's already done.\" Only one thing, he says, could cure the frustrating powerlessness he now feels. He would love to come face to face with his cyber alter ego on a dark night. \"Not very constructive I know: but it would make me feel a whole lot better.\"",

      "bodyText": "Just days after curmudgeonly Victor Meldrew was killed off and Inspector Morse had a fatal heart attack, a new survey has found that older people resent being stereotyped as either grumpy or sweet in TV comedy and drama. The study of the over-50s also found a lack of interest among older audiences in programmes specifically aimed at them. And it found that older viewers believe that over-50s were under-represented on TV programmes aimed at mass audiences. The advertising industry in particular is criticised by 50-somethings for portraying a narrow, idealised version of consumers. People in the 50-60 age group felt strongly that advertisers should change their attitudes and the images they use during the next five to 10 years to reflect the profile of their changing market. The survey, Age in the Frame, which was drawn from the results of focus group sessions is published today by the Independent Television Commission and Age Concern England. While many over-50s enjoyed One Foot in the Grave, they found it unfortunate that Victor Meldrew's grumpy character was the best-known old person on TV. Last of the Summer Wine also came in for criticism, though again some older people said they still found it funny. But one focus group participant described the long-running sitcom as \"patronising\". He said: \"It's just a bunch of daft old gits running around and fancying a woman with wrinkled stockings around her ankles.\" The report found that older viewers resent being pigeon-holed as the Songs of Praise generation, when they have a wide range of interests and viewing habits. One respondent said: \"We like the same things we liked when we were younger. I like The Royle Family and Have I Got News For You just like my grandson.\" A lady in her 60s added that she liked \"a good violent American thriller. The type of thing with Al Pacino in it\".

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair is considering the creation of a Department for Social Inclusion, headed by a cabinet minister, to spearhead a revived anti-poverty drive in the most deprived areas if Labour wins a second term. The formation of the Whitehall ministry to coordinate policies intended to help the \"underclass\" is under discussion within Downing Street as the prime minister considers what should be in Labour's election manifesto. Mr Blair plans to make poverty a key election issue, a commitment that would be welcomed in Labour's heartlands and establish clear blue water between the government and Tory leader William Hague. A No 10 official said the new ministry would be carved out of John Prescott's sprawling Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Hilary Armstrong, minister for local government and the regions in the department, who is highly rated by the prime minister, has been tipped in government circles for promotion to the post. The department would take over and expand the role of the cabinet office's social exclusion unit and work closely with other ministries, including social security, health and education, as well as the Treasury. The department would be named social inclusion rather than social exclusion to put the emphasis on positive efforts. It could be responsible for community regeneration and town hall affairs. The environment department classifies 1,370 estates as \"run down\" and suffering from multiple problems including high unemployment, bad housing, low education standards and ill health. Establishing the department would be seen as an acknowledgment that the social exclusion unit has not been as successful as the prime minister envisaged, as well as evidence of Mr Blair's commitment to tackling poverty. Headed by Moira Wallace, a former Treasury high-flyer and Downing Street private secretary, the social exclusion unit is staffed by some 40 of the brightest civil servants. A string of studies and initiatives, including an \u00a3800m neighbourhood renewal scheme, have been produced but the unit has been the vic tim of \"turf wars\" with departments. A review last year by cabinet office officials and KPMG consultants concluded the unit's work \"has been on the whole less enthusiastically received inside government than outside\". Appointing a cabinet minister to run a new department, said the No 10 official, would \"send a clear signal to the rest of Whitehall as well as the country at large that Labour is serious about ending social deprivation and exclusion\". With an election expected in May after Labour's three byelection victories last week, a decision on whether to create the department could be taken early in the new year. Mr Blair has shown a marked reluctance to reform Whitehall but setting up a social inclusion department would partly undo one of the changes he did introduce after merging the environment and transport departments. Created specifically for Mr Prescott as deputy prime minister after the last election, it faces another shake-up after the next election. In addition to the possibility of urban affairs being transferred to a new department, Stephen Byers, the trade secretary, believes the eight regional development agencies would fit into the Department of Trade and Industry. Some ministers in other departments believe the environment and transport portfolios should be separated to reduce the department to a manageable scale while others think they should remain united. Ms Armstrong and Mr Prescott have clashed over English elected mayors, which she is keener on than he is, and regional government. She was slapped down by her boss in public early this year after voicing doubts about English regional assemblies. Some advisers close to the environment department, who could see the logic of an all-embracing department when it was formed, now believe it is running out of time because it is too big. One longstanding Westminster ally of Mr Prescott said: \"John has had to deal with flak from N0 10, and its policy wonks, while pulling together a lot of other things, and frankly he's knackered.

      "body": "<p>Britain's cartoonists meet for their annual awards ceremony on Wednesday and they are entitled to feel that in the broadsheet press the political cartoon has rarely, perhaps never, been in such good shape. The specialists in full-size visual commentary - the Guardian's Steve Bell and Martin Rowson, the Observer's Chris Riddell, the Times's Peter Brookes and the Independent's Dave Brown - alone constitute a squad unrivalled even in the satirical 60s, the heyday of Scarfe and Steadman. </p> <p>But here is a tricky test: can you name a single political cartoonist on a daily national tabloid? Only if you see one of these papers regularly are you likely to remember, probably after prompting, that the Mail boasts Mac and Mahood, the Express Paul Thomas, the Sun Dave Gaskill and the Mirror Tom Johnston. These are not exactly names to conjure with, and ploughing through a week's worth of their work suggests why: a genuinely imaginative tabloid cartoon is as rare as a female cartoonist. </p> <p>Out of close to 50 images, only Thomas's drawing of Putin and Blair boozily discussing women - the latter drooling about Thatcher - struck me as fresh in conception and distinctive in technique. The Mail on Sunday's Heath is by far the most original stylist on the tabloids, but his talents seem unsuited to the single-joke requirements of the commentary page cartoon. </p> <p>But you don't have to believe me: believe their editors. While in the quality press single cartoons still occupy their time-honoured slots - \"pocket\" gags on the front page, bigger images at the op-ed heart of the paper - they have been marginalised in the pops. Since the mid-market titles went tabloid, none of the national dailies has found room on the front page for a pocket cartoon (the nearest equivalents are Mahood's stamp-size offerings in the Mail, which cling on precariously at the foot of page two). </p> <p>And only the Express still regularly puts its cartoonist amid its leaders and rent-a-rant opinion articles - the Mail banishes amiable, apolitical Mac from the feral arena where Paul Johnson and Simon Heffer roar and paw the ground to the grey wasteland of page 15, while the Sun varies the cartoon's position from day to day, sometimes dropping it altogether, and the Star rarely runs one. In the Sundays, the Sunday Mirror also opts out, the People has no cartoonist of its own and the News of the World's Charles Griffin is confined to illustrating Sion Simon's on-message musings. </p> <p>Most eccentric of all is the Mirror, which eschews the usual sizeable cartoon in favour of a vertical strip of four separate, smaller efforts, all by Tom Johnston. With this Stakhanovite producing 28 gags per week (he also labours for the People) quality inevitably suffers. Editors traditionally choose the best joke from \"roughs\" presented by the cartoonist; here, instead, the roughs all make it on to the page, with weak and passable ideas run indiscriminately side by side. </p> <p>Still, these jokesmiths can at least not be accused of betraying a distinguished tradition, for the fact is that a great cartoonist, at the top of his form, has never worked on a popular national daily. Neither of the two giants who dominated the decades between the 30s and the 60s, Low and Vicky, did so. David Low, the New Zealand-born creator of Colonel Blimp, was unsettled during his brief period (1949-52) on the Labour-controlled Daily Herald, despite his left-wing views. His final years were spent on the then Man chester Guardian and his devastating attacks on Hitler and militarism were produced while on Beaverbrook's Evening Standard. </p> <p>The German-Hungarian emigr\u00e9 Vicky, also a socialist, was similarly unhappy when working in the 50s for a Daily Mirror then selling 5m copies per day, worried that he could no longer influence the powerful. His best work appeared in the Standard, the New Statesman and - throughout the 30s and 40s - the News Chronicle, a Liberal paper with a circulation of 1-1.5m. </p> <p>Both men, however, were popular cartoonists, producing simple, potent images and backing the underdog against menacing tyrants abroad and amoral arms traders and a fossilised establishment at home. There was nothing subtle or arty about \"Very Well, Alone\", Low's 1940 image of Churchillian defiance, or Vicky's Macmillan as \"Supermac\". </p> <p>Similarly, Steve Bell's versions of Major, Hague and Prescott are not inherently \"broadsheet\" in style - and tabloid editors would give up their chauffeur-driven cars to get their hands on them. But the fact that they appeared in the Guardian says a lot about trends in political caricature over the intervening years. With no significant successor emerging in the popular press since Vicky quit the Mirror, if someone asks you if you saw a cartoon in one of the tabloids, they almost certainly mean a strip cartoon (even in that genre standards have declined markedly, with most funnies pages combining strips past their sell-by dates with desperate attempts to extract humour from sex and football). </p> <p>In the broadsheets, meanwhile, the decisive figure was Gerald Scarfe, who signalled a return to the viciousness of Rowlandson and Gillray with such memorably grotesque 60s work as his Private Eye depiction of Labour's supine backing of the US during the Vietnam war: Harold Wilson, tongue lolling, is preparing to lick the arse of LBJ, who observes: \"I've heard of a special relationship, but this is ridiculous.\" In moving from the Eye to the Sunday Times, Scarfe foreshadowed the way today's stars typically hone their art in work for magazines with niche readerships before making the jump to broadsheet titles: Bell, for example, made his name in the London listings press and the New Statesman before joining the Guardian. Not content with starting two trends, Scarfe also pioneered full-colour sculptural caricatures photographed for magazine covers - a technique also adopted by Fluck and Law, who later reworked it into the television series Spitting Image. </p> <p>What Scarfe, the supreme draughtsman, could not have foreseen in the 60s was that this shift away from drawn caricature would play a major part in sapping the health of the traditional cartoon. Various diagnoses of the present malaise are possible, including the bewildering changes of political stance by all the tabloids since the rise of New Labour and a (clearly related) general failure to produce an image of Tony Blair as indelible as Bell's John Major as anti-Superman - a distant, mocking echo of Vicky's Supermac - with baggy Y-fronts worn outside his trousers. Overridingly, though, Spitting Image and the new, merciless style of caricature that produced it have made the old-fashioned approach look pallid and impotent. </p> <p>If a tabloid editor today wants a major front page or op-ed page political hit job, he no longer orders a drawn image \u00e0 la Low and Vicky. Instead he turns to another tradition, also generated by the anti-fascist and anti-war struggles of the 20s and 30s: photo-montage. The Sun's jeering stunts - Kinnock with a lightbulb head; Hague as a parrot; and, on the back page, Graham Taylor as a turnip - were mimicked in Thursday's Mirror by Sun alumnus Piers Morgan, depicting Hague as Thatcher's poodle. </p> <p>The whole concept was itself ironically poodle-like, dutifully echoing Blair's Commons attack on Wednesday, and the execution was gratingly crude. But tabloid political cartoonists will not have missed its subtext: for them, the writing is on the wall.</p>",

Both men, however, were popular cartoonists, producing simple, potent images and backing the underdog against menacing tyrants abroad and amoral arms traders and a fossilised establishment at home. There was nothing subtle or arty about \"Very Well, Alone\", Low's 1940 image of Churchillian defiance, or Vicky's Macmillan as \"Supermac\". Similarly, Steve Bell's versions of Major, Hague and Prescott are not inherently \"broadsheet\" in style - and tabloid editors would give up their chauffeur-driven cars to get their hands on them. But the fact that they appeared in the Guardian says a lot about trends in political caricature over the intervening years. With no significant successor emerging in the popular press since Vicky quit the Mirror, if someone asks you if you saw a cartoon in one of the tabloids, they almost certainly mean a strip cartoon (even in that genre standards have declined markedly, with most funnies pages combining strips past their sell-by dates with desperate attempts to extract humour from sex and football). In the broadsheets, meanwhile, the decisive figure was Gerald Scarfe, who signalled a return to the viciousness of Rowlandson and Gillray with such memorably grotesque 60s work as his Private Eye depiction of Labour's supine backing of the US during the Vietnam war: Harold Wilson, tongue lolling, is preparing to lick the arse of LBJ, who observes: \"I've heard of a special relationship, but this is ridiculous.\" In moving from the Eye to the Sunday Times, Scarfe foreshadowed the way today's stars typically hone their art in work for magazines with niche readerships before making the jump to broadsheet titles: Bell, for example, made his name in the London listings press and the New Statesman before joining the Guardian. Not content with starting two trends, Scarfe also pioneered full-colour sculptural caricatures photographed for magazine covers - a technique also adopted by Fluck and Law, who later reworked it into the television series Spitting Image. What Scarfe, the supreme draughtsman, could not have foreseen in the 60s was that this shift away from drawn caricature would play a major part in sapping the health of the traditional cartoon. Various diagnoses of the present malaise are possible, including the bewildering changes of political stance by all the tabloids since the rise of New Labour and a (clearly related) general failure to produce an image of Tony Blair as indelible as Bell's John Major as anti-Superman - a distant, mocking echo of Vicky's Supermac - with baggy Y-fronts worn outside his trousers. Overridingly, though, Spitting Image and the new, merciless style of caricature that produced it have made the old-fashioned approach look pallid and impotent. If a tabloid editor today wants a major front page or op-ed page political hit job, he no longer orders a drawn image \u00e0 la Low and Vicky. Instead he turns to another tradition, also generated by the anti-fascist and anti-war struggles of the 20s and 30s: photo-montage. The Sun's jeering stunts - Kinnock with a lightbulb head; Hague as a parrot; and, on the back page, Graham Taylor as a turnip - were mimicked in Thursday's Mirror by Sun alumnus Piers Morgan, depicting Hague as Thatcher's poodle. The whole concept was itself ironically poodle-like, dutifully echoing Blair's Commons attack on Wednesday, and the execution was gratingly crude. But tabloid political cartoonists will not have missed its subtext: for them, the writing is on the wall.",

      "bodyText": "George W Bush was early today declared the winner in Florida - and stood on the threshold of the White House after the most fiercely disputed presidential election in more than a century. Nineteen days after polling day, the local secretary of state, Katherine Harris, certified a Republican victory over Al Gore in Florida by just 537 votes, enough to finally take Mr Bush past the winning post in the electoral college if the result is allowed to stand. But the Gore campaign and the Democrats flatly refused to give in. Instead it signalled a defiant fusillade of legal challenges. Mr Gore will call on the Florida courts today to order judicial recounts of thousands of disputed votes, a move which would take the battle for the White House deep into December. Under plans being prepared in the Gore camp, the vice-president's lawyers will today trigger a formal \"contest\" of the results in Florida. They will ask a state judge to order court-appointed \"special masters\" to complete interrupted recounts of about 2,000 uncounted votes in Palm Beach county and 10,700 uncounted votes in Miami-Dade county. They will call for an inquiry into the returns from Nassau county, and perhaps challenge the legality of Palm Beach's \"butterfly ballots\", which may have confused voters. \"We're preparing contest papers that will be filed Monday, as early in the day as we can get them done,\" a Gore lawyer, David Boies, said yesterday. \"Until these votes are counted, this election cannot be over.\" Mr Gore's new legal moves were being readied last night as the deadline passed at 5pm local time for Florida counties to submit their hand recount votes to Ms Harris. Only one of three critical south Florida counties proved able to meet yesterday's recount deadline completely. Ms Harris formally certified the end of the presidential election in Florida, declaring Mr Bush the winner of the state's 25 electoral college votes. That in turn would allow Mr Bush to declare himself president-elect and to claim the White House by a 271-267 margin in the electoral college. Mr Bush might demand the keys to Washington offices reserved for the incoming administration's \"transition\" team as early as today, some reports said. Republicans believe that these events would be a turning point in the battle and that Mr Gore would come under increasing pressure to end his fight, irrespective of the legal options. With such a scenario in prospect last night, the Gore camp made clear that they would refuse to concede the election to Mr Bush, and would instead continue efforts to have all the votes fully examined. The central objective of the new legal moves remains the same, to have a complete hand recount of disputed machine-punched ballot papers in three counties believed to be rich in excluded Gore votes. Only Broward county completed its latest recount in time to meet the Sunday dead line set last week by the Florida supreme court. In the completed Broward recount, which took 11 days, Mr Gore made a net gain of 567 votes. A second county, Palm Beach, announced at midday yesterday that it would not be able to complete its recount by the 5pm deadline and sent a letter to Ms Harris requesting an extension to 9am today. With two hours still remaining to the deadline, Ms Harris refused the request, at which point Palm Beach officials prepared to submit their returns on the basis of what they had recounted. That left more than 2,000 ballots not examined, which officials continued to scrutinise after the deadline had passed. Mr Gore was said to have gained about 46 net votes in county's recount as of yesterday morning. A third and more heavily populated county, Miami-Dade, had been expected to yield a large harvest of extra votes for Mr Gore before officials called off the recount last Wednesday under pressure from Republican protesters and for lack of time. Mr Gore's new court action today aims to reopen the status of 10,700 uncounted papers that were rejected in a machine recount. Twelve other counties also submitted amended recount figures to Ms Harris yesterday, even though they have not conducted full recounts. In Tallahassee, where Ms Harris has her office, there was feverish activity as the deadline approached. Placard waving demonstrators from both sides gathered outside the Florida state capitol building. Anxious to prevent Mr Bush from gaining a public relations advantage from the certification, Democrats wheeled out a new heavy hitter on Mr Gore's behalf, when former Senator George Mitchell appeared in Tallahassee and called for patience on all sides. In addition to going back to court himself today, Mr Gore will be closely watching a hearing that is due in Seminole county, where a suit alleges that 4,700 postal votes that were included in the count should be thrown out because of irregularities. If that complaint is upheld, it could swing the election in Florida back to Mr Gore on its own.

      "bodyText": "Britain will not hand over tax controls to the European Union, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, insisted before key talks between EU finance ministers today. He said that taxation was a matter of national identity and stated that he would hold on to the British veto at the discussions in Brussels. His comments signal that there will be a battle ahead on the issue for the prime minister, Tony Blair, when he attends a crucial summit in Nice in a fortnight. Mr Brown was today expected to block moves to switch to majority voting for five key management policies affecting economic and monetary union. The UK is under pressure to agree to give up the veto in dozens of areas to make decision making simpler as the EU expands in the next few years. However, tax - like social security, external trade, and immigration and asylum policies - are sacrosanct, the government says. One of the flashpoints is an EU-wide tax on the interest on savings - a tax Britain has fended off thanks to the need for unanimous approval. Instead of accepting the tax, the UK is agreeing to exchange information with other member states on tax liability. The French finance minister, Laurent Fabius, in a jibe at the UK, said that things would have been much easier if the savings tax issue had been subject to qualified majority voting, instead of unanimity. But Mr Brown said that it was the power of the veto which blocked the others from imposing a damaging savings tax on the City of London. And he set out bluntly the government's position at the forthcoming Nice summit. He said: \"Tax decisions reflect national values and the national identity - choices people want to make at a national level. \"This should not be subject to qualified majority voting or harmonised tax rates.

      "body": "<p>Architects are to be encouraged to \"delight\" the people who use, work in, and live with new buildings in an initiative designed to help sweep away the legacy of souless municipal architecture and improve the quality of Britain's public buildings. </p> <p>Under a new set of performance indicators being produced by the Construction Industry Council, architects and bodies commissioning new buildings will be encouraged to consider whether the planned building has \"the wow factor\" as well as the more traditional concerns of function and cost. </p> <p>The project, being developed at Sussex University, will ask interested parties to consider the \"effect on the mind and the senses\" of new developments. In an attempt at produce a \"delight rating\" for a given building architects, clients and the intended users of the building will be encouraged to ask: \"What do passers-by think of the building?\", \"Does it provide a focal point for the community?\", and \"Can you have a party in it?\" </p> <p>The move is an attempt to encourage local authorities and spending bodies to move beyond a cost-only consideration of new buildings and consider the wider implications. It is also a response to public perception that many modern structures are overly functional and somewhat souless, intended to be of use and pleasure only to those that work in them. </p> <p>The \"delight detector\" project coincides with government initiatives to try to ensure that the promised increase in public sector spending will leave a legacy of high quality public-friendly buildings. </p> <p>Last month, Tony Blair stressed the need for architects and public sector clients to consider more than cost and pure function when reviewing the quality of designs, in a foreword to a Department of Culture, Media and Sport report, entitled Better Public Buildings. </p> <p>The report concluded that thoughtful high-quality public buildings could bring about dramatic social benefits. On housing estates crime and vandalism could be discouraged, while quality school and hospital buildings could help reduce truancy rates and improve recovery from illness. </p> <p>Robin Nicholson, deputy chairman of the CIC, said that even potentially mundane structures can bring a little pleasure. </p> <p>\"There is always room for delight, whatever that may mean. In education and health buildings it is an absolutely fundamental economic benefit - a good, well-designed school enables kids to be more social and provides a better environment for learning,\" he told the trade magazine Building Design. </p> <p>\"That is not always immediately apparent to those buying hospitals and schools. The government is extremely keen on having something like this; they realise that least-cost projects leave long-term cost consequences. </p> <p>\"The project is about raising awareness among clients of the things that really matter but are not immediately apparent. Lots of people dismiss measuring but we are not trying to measure, we are trying to raise awareness,\" he said. </p> <p>One project widely praised both for having a positive effect on its immediate environment and community is the new Peckham library in south-east London, commissioned by Southwark council. Designed by architects Alsop &amp; Stormer, the library is an example of the community-minded municipal building the government has in mind. Attractive, innovative and distinctive it lies at the heart of the regeneration of the centre of Peckham, and public consultation was a crucial part of the design process. </p> <p>Jonathan Leah, an associate director at Alsop &amp; Stormer, welcomed the CIC initiative. \"Often one finds that price is at the top of the list of requirements and architecture way down at the bottom,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We have striven as a practice to get the question of quality and image considered more by clients, as was the case in Peckham. Value for money is always going to be a concern whether you are dealing with a public sector or a private client but that is no reason why you have to create dull, grey buildings that are only of use to the people who work in them. </p> <p>\"We welcome the view that says quality of design is important, but it can be a difficult area. We are dealing with subjective judgments here.\" </p> <p><strong>Comment, Jonathan Glancey</strong></p> <p>No one can measure the pleasure or delight buildings give in precise, mathematical terms. </p> <p>Maybe we could all be wired up and our body heat or heart rate measured to see by what degree these rose or fell when faced by the raw concrete Brutalism of London's Hayward Gallery or the super-refined Sainsbury Centre for the Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia. </p> <p>But, what if the art on display in the former, normally considered a beast, was very much better than that on show in the latter - by general acclaim, a modern beauty? Surely our experience of the two buildings would then be very different from the way we might have perceived them when empty? </p> <p>For better or worse, buildings are normally containers for a range of human activities. We judge them as much by the way they look as how they behave. So many elegant Georgian and operatic Victorian buildings have gone the way of the bulldozer and been replaced by soulless modern office blocks because their looks were never enough to make society care for them in their old age. </p> <p>In any case, one generation's eyesore is another's delight. Could anyone, aside from a few be leagured architects and wilful critics, have imagined that Trellick Tower, Erno Goldfinger's pugilistic west London tower block, completed in 1973, would have been considered an achingly hip place to live today? </p> <p>One thing we can all agree on is that new buildings should not be mean-spirited. They should be well and generously built. </p> <p>But if some future official \"delight factor\" measurement led to the end of radical design that might appear to offend the public's eye before it, finally, wins its fickle heart, then it is to be given as wide a berth as any post-modern office block of the 1980s or dismal distribution centre or call centre of today.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jonathan Glancey is the Guardian's architecture critic</p> <p><strong> Delightful</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao</strong> (Frank Gehry) </p> <p>Voluptuous, clad in titanium scales and fronted by Jeff Koon's potty flower puppy. </p> <p><strong> Great Court, British Museum, London</strong> (Foster and Partners) </p> <p>Supremely refined new covered public square at the heart of one of the world's busiest museums </p> <p><strong> Jewish Museum, Berlin</strong> (Daniel Libeskind) </p> <p>A three-dimensional bolt of lightning that has had queues waiting to see inside its deconstructivist zinc skin. </p> <p><strong> Kansai International Airport, Osaka Bay</strong> (Renzo Piano/Building Workshop) </p> <p>A tidal wave of a building, airy and light.

      "bodyText": "Architects are to be encouraged to \"delight\" the people who use, work in, and live with new buildings in an initiative designed to help sweep away the legacy of souless municipal architecture and improve the quality of Britain's public buildings. Under a new set of performance indicators being produced by the Construction Industry Council, architects and bodies commissioning new buildings will be encouraged to consider whether the planned building has \"the wow factor\" as well as the more traditional concerns of function and cost. The project, being developed at Sussex University, will ask interested parties to consider the \"effect on the mind and the senses\" of new developments. In an attempt at produce a \"delight rating\" for a given building architects, clients and the intended users of the building will be encouraged to ask: \"What do passers-by think of the building?\", \"Does it provide a focal point for the community?\", and \"Can you have a party in it?\" The move is an attempt to encourage local authorities and spending bodies to move beyond a cost-only consideration of new buildings and consider the wider implications. It is also a response to public perception that many modern structures are overly functional and somewhat souless, intended to be of use and pleasure only to those that work in them. The \"delight detector\" project coincides with government initiatives to try to ensure that the promised increase in public sector spending will leave a legacy of high quality public-friendly buildings. Last month, Tony Blair stressed the need for architects and public sector clients to consider more than cost and pure function when reviewing the quality of designs, in a foreword to a Department of Culture, Media and Sport report, entitled Better Public Buildings. The report concluded that thoughtful high-quality public buildings could bring about dramatic social benefits. On housing estates crime and vandalism could be discouraged, while quality school and hospital buildings could help reduce truancy rates and improve recovery from illness. Robin Nicholson, deputy chairman of the CIC, said that even potentially mundane structures can bring a little pleasure. \"There is always room for delight, whatever that may mean. In education and health buildings it is an absolutely fundamental economic benefit - a good, well-designed school enables kids to be more social and provides a better environment for learning,\" he told the trade magazine Building Design. \"That is not always immediately apparent to those buying hospitals and schools. The government is extremely keen on having something like this; they realise that least-cost projects leave long-term cost consequences. \"The project is about raising awareness among clients of the things that really matter but are not immediately apparent. Lots of people dismiss measuring but we are not trying to measure, we are trying to raise awareness,\" he said. One project widely praised both for having a positive effect on its immediate environment and community is the new Peckham library in south-east London, commissioned by Southwark council. Designed by architects Alsop &amp; Stormer, the library is an example of the community-minded municipal building the government has in mind. Attractive, innovative and distinctive it lies at the heart of the regeneration of the centre of Peckham, and public consultation was a crucial part of the design process. Jonathan Leah, an associate director at Alsop &amp; Stormer, welcomed the CIC initiative. \"Often one finds that price is at the top of the list of requirements and architecture way down at the bottom,\" he said. \"We have striven as a practice to get the question of quality and image considered more by clients, as was the case in Peckham. Value for money is always going to be a concern whether you are dealing with a public sector or a private client but that is no reason why you have to create dull, grey buildings that are only of use to the people who work in them. \"We welcome the view that says quality of design is important, but it can be a difficult area. We are dealing with subjective judgments here.\" Comment, Jonathan Glancey No one can measure the pleasure or delight buildings give in precise, mathematical terms. Maybe we could all be wired up and our body heat or heart rate measured to see by what degree these rose or fell when faced by the raw concrete Brutalism of London's Hayward Gallery or the super-refined Sainsbury Centre for the Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia. But, what if the art on display in the former, normally considered a beast, was very much better than that on show in the latter - by general acclaim, a modern beauty? Surely our experience of the two buildings would then be very different from the way we might have perceived them when empty? For better or worse, buildings are normally containers for a range of human activities. We judge them as much by the way they look as how they behave. So many elegant Georgian and operatic Victorian buildings have gone the way of the bulldozer and been replaced by soulless modern office blocks because their looks were never enough to make society care for them in their old age. In any case, one generation's eyesore is another's delight. Could anyone, aside from a few be leagured architects and wilful critics, have imagined that Trellick Tower, Erno Goldfinger's pugilistic west London tower block, completed in 1973, would have been considered an achingly hip place to live today? One thing we can all agree on is that new buildings should not be mean-spirited. They should be well and generously built. But if some future official \"delight factor\" measurement led to the end of radical design that might appear to offend the public's eye before it, finally, wins its fickle heart, then it is to be given as wide a berth as any post-modern office block of the 1980s or dismal distribution centre or call centre of today. \u00b7 Jonathan Glancey is the Guardian's architecture critic Delightful Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao (Frank Gehry) Voluptuous, clad in titanium scales and fronted by Jeff Koon's potty flower puppy.

The controversial move would hand unprecedented powers over the lives of vulnerable children to private agencies, charities or religious organisations. It raises serious questions about the protection of youngsters. But shadow ministers argue that after a string of abuse scandals, and controversy over adoptive parents being rejected by 'politically correct' social workers, the existing system is failing. Shadow health secretary Liam Fox is drawing up the blueprint with home affairs spokesman David Lidington, who oversees the new US-style Renewing One Nation taskforce aiming to involve religious groups and the private sector in welfare. Fox told The Observer he was considering all options for adoption reform including bringing in the private sector. 'What we want to have is a properly regulated service, and I don't think it matters so much who actually does it,' he added. 'I want a proper national register for all prospective adoptive and fostering parents with an objective set of criteria, so that if you were on the register you would be considered suitable anywhere in the country. 'And we want to make sure that all children in care over a certain length of time, probably a year, would get an adoption plan drawn up for them. 'I am all in favour of not having it an exclusively state sector, as long as we have protection for children and get suitable monitoring.' The running of children's homes could also 'potentially' be contracted out to private firms, he added, and be state-regulated as private nursing homes are. Fox has studied a forthcoming report from the influential right-wing think-tank the Bow Group, which condemns the state as 'the worst parent in Britain'. It suggests that private providers be paid by results such as educational achievements for children in care, while the private sector should 'take over entirely the vetting of adoptive parents and the placement of children'. Shadow ministers are not prepared to go that far, arguing for a mix of public and private sector provision. But their plans were condemned as 'grotesque' by Shaun Woodward, the ex-Tory MP who defected to Labour and is a trustee of Childline. 'The state does not have a record without blemish. But to move from a recognition that something needs to be fixed to saying we completely give up on it and we are prepared to put it into the private sector, which at the end of the day is about profit, is fundamentally wrong.'

Ken Lodge, who runs his own private investigation firm in east London, was arrested in the Cuban capital in October with five male colleagues and the girlfriend of one of the men. They were all released after the Cuban president, Fidel Castro, intervened. Mr Lodge denied being hired by the wife of a rich Panamanian businessman who suspected her husband of marital infidelity, claiming instead to be gathering information on a particular individual for a client who lived in the United States. Mr Lodge was the only one of the seven to face the press at Gatwick airport yesterday, although he said some of his colleagues had been on the same flight. He said he had been \"well treated\" during his captivity, where he lived on a diet of rice, beans and chicken, and passed the time reading Richard Branson's autobiography three times, a book which he described as \"brilliant\". The Britons were arrested on October 8 on suspicion of working for US intelligence agencies. The Cuban authorities initially refused to allow the British government consular access to the seven, provoking a diplomatic incident. \"We were not working for the government.

      "body": "<p>Nothing is more exciting than to hear the tunes one has composed played for the first time by a 50-piece orchestra,\" wrote Charlie Chaplin in his autobiography. Perhaps because he was so multifaceted - a comic actor of extraordinary imagination, an untiring, perfectionist director, the co-founder of United Artists - it seems unfair that Chaplin had one more talent. But, though it is largely overlooked today, the creator of the Little Tramp was an accomplished musician who wrote soundtracks for nearly all of his films - although he wasn't always credited, as in the case of The Great Dictator, whose score he co-wrote. His music for Limelight won him an Oscar; Petula Clark even had a massive hit with Chaplin's This is My Song, a tune from A Countess from Hong Kong. </p> <p>Chaplin's scores have a foot-tapping catchiness; they get stuck in your head and you find yourself whistling the tunes. His feel for music sprang from a childhood submerged in the songs and waltzes of the music hall. As a child, Chaplin worked on the stage as part of a clog-dancing troupe, the Eight Lancashire Lads, and later for the successful comedy company owned by impresario Fred Karno. He played the piano, and as a boy he had acquired a violin and a cello (strung in reverse, as he was left handed). As he could not read music, he played all his instruments by ear. He wrote in his autobiography that \"since the age of 16 I had practised from four to six hours a day in my bedroom. Each week I took lessons from the theatre conductor or someone he recommended_ I had great ambitions to be a concert artist, or, failing that, to use it in a vaudeville act.\" </p> <p>But why did Chaplin end up composing? The clinching factor was the introduction of sound to the movies. He conceived of his film City Lights as silent, but sound became an option while the movie was being made. According to Carl Davis, who conducts Chaplin's score of The Gold Rush in London on Saturday, \"he made an astonishing decision - to keep City Lights a 'silent' film, that is, without dialogue. But he took advantage of the new technology to write and record a score, and sound effects too. That is when the idea of Chaplin as composer evolved.\" </p> <p>This arrangement must have suited the talkies-resistant Chaplin down to the ground. Before the introduction of sound, Chaplin had himself selected the music to be played in cinemas with his films. But the invention of the recorded soundtrack gave him absolute control - a concept that was of prime importance to Chaplin in his film-making. Sound allowed him to create an ultimate artwork, complete in every way. Nothing would be left to chance; everything would now be perfectly, ineffably, Chaplin. The technique was so successful that later Chaplin went back to his earlier silent movies and rereleased them with soundtracks - which is how the The Gold Rush, originally made in 1925, acquired its score in 1942. </p> <p>Because Chaplin could not read music, when it came to writing soundtracks his hums and improvisations had to be taken down and orchestrated by collaborators. \"His assistants had a terrible time,\" says Davis. \"It must have been torture. He was very, very moody.\" Chaplin himself wrote about this process: \"Sometimes a musician would get pompous with me, and I would cut him short: 'Whatever the melody is, the rest is just a vamp.' After putting music to one or two pictures I began to look at a conductor's score with a professional eye and to know whether a composition was over-orchestrated or not. If I saw a lot of notes in the brass and woodwind section I would say: 'That's too black in the brass,' or 'too busy in the woodwinds'.\" </p> <p>Chaplin's early experience of music hall also informed the way he worked with music. As he said in a 1952 radio interview: \"I use music as a counterpoint, and I learned that from the Fred Karno Company. For instance if they had squalid surroundings with a lot of comedy tramps working in it, they would have very beautiful, boudoir music, something of the 18th century, very lush and grandiose, and it would be satirical, a counterpoint.\" </p> <p>That technique is certainly evident in The Gold Rush, particularly in the famous scene in which the Little Tramp and a gold prospector are stuck in a remote, snowbound hut without food. It is Thanksgiving Day, and the Tramp comes up with the idea of boiling his boot for dinner. Says Davis: \"The boot is produced, and Chaplin handles it as if he is a maitre d' at the Savoy. He carves it exquisitely as if it is a gourmet dish, a roast rib of beef. The nails are treated as if they are elegant little bones; the shoelaces are like delicate spaghetti. To support this performance he gives us the music of a palm court trio - of just the sort you could hear at the Savoy. The humour lies in the contrast between the elegance of the performance and the music, and the scene of desolation and despair.\" </p> <p>In his autobiography Chaplin wrote, \"Musical arrangers rarely understood this [technique]. They wanted the music to be funny. But I would explain that I wanted no competition, I wanted the music to express sentiment.\" It does, and sentimentality too. In The Gold Rush, Chaplin has invited his heartthrob, Georgia, to New Year's Eve dinner (Georgia herself has a charming love theme, adapted from a piece of Brahms piano music). Georgia accepted the invitation only as a joke, and she doesn't show up. Instead she celebrates with her friends in the local dance hall. The strains of Auld Lang Syne just reach the Little Tramp's hut, where the table lies set and the candles are burnt down. </p> <p>Chaplin's celebrity existence in prewar California brought him into contact with a starry collection of classical musicians, by whom he seems to have been much admired. There is 1930s film footage of him improvising duets with the composer and pianist Germaine Tailleferre. He was friendly with composer Hanns Eisler (and had a sticky time at a press conference after the release of 1947's Monsieur Verdoux, when he was asked to respond to allegations that Eisler was a communist). He was photographed with the great violinist Yascha Heifetz, and he was on dining terms with Horowitz, Rachmaninov and Schoenberg. </p> <p>Stravinsky was struck with the idea of making a film with Chaplin; over dinner Chaplin invented a surrealist scenario, involving a decadent nightclub that would include a depiction of Christ's crucifixion. Stravinsky was shocked - he regarded the idea as sacrilegious. Chaplin soon lost interest in the thought. </p> <p>\"Composers had a very strange idea of how they might work with Chaplin,\" says Davis. \"Schoenberg, for instance, thought he could write a score first and have Chaplin write the scenes around it. But it is natural that these great artists should have been attracted to Charlie. He was one of them. His scores, within the boundaries that he set himself, are perfect. I would not change a note of them.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Gold Rush, with a live score conducted by Carl Davis, will be screened at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242), on Saturday.</p>",

Chaplin soon lost interest in the thought. \"Composers had a very strange idea of how they might work with Chaplin,\" says Davis. \"Schoenberg, for instance, thought he could write a score first and have Chaplin write the scenes around it. But it is natural that these great artists should have been attracted to Charlie. He was one of them. His scores, within the boundaries that he set himself, are perfect. I would not change a note of them.\" \u0095 The Gold Rush, with a live score conducted by Carl Davis, will be screened at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242), on Saturday.",

      "body": "<p>A year after Bristol detectives finally started to unravel the ring of paedophiles who had been abusing children there for up to 20 years, they found an informant with an alarming story. The man, whom we will call Terry, had a long history of sexually abusing boys. He did not come from Bristol but, by chance, he had come across some of the paedophiles the detectives were investigating - in Amsterdam, where he said they had become involved with a group of exiled British child abusers who had succeeded in commercialising their sexual obsession.</p> <p>The exiled paedophiles were trafficking boys from other countries; running legitimate gay brothels and selling under-aged boys \"under the counter\"; they had branched out into the production of child pornography. And they had killed some of them. One boy had simply been shot through the head, Terry said: he had been causing trouble and had been executed in front of several pae dophiles. Another, he believed, had been thrown into one of the canals. But the one about whom he spoke the most was a boy who had been tortured and killed in the most painful fashion in the course of producing a pornographic video.</p> <p>Terry said he had seen most of the video himself and had vomited before he could reach the end. The few detectives who specialise in the investigation of child abuse invariably say the same thing about \"snuff\" movies: they have often heard of them, sometimes pursued them but never found one. The videos remain one of the great unsolved mysteries of the burgeoning underworld of international sexual exploitation.</p> <p><b>Twice told tale</b><br> Terry's account was so hideous as to invite disbelief. It was clearly possible that he was inventing the story in an attempt to curry favour with the detectives as they turned over Bristol's paedophile subculture. And yet the detectives discovered that the allegation had been made before.</p> <p>Not just once but repeatedly, evidence had come to the attention of police in England and the Netherlands, that, for pleasure and profit, some of the exiled paedophiles in Amsterdam had mur dered boys in front of the camera. Some of the evidence had been pursued. Some of it had been ignored. None of it had led to a murder charge. For a short while, the Bristol detectives thought they might be able to make progress in tracking down the truth; but when two of them flew to Amsterdam in the autumn of 1998 to pass on their information to Dutch officers, they hit a wall.</p> <p>Terry had described the flat in Amsterdam where he had seen the video; he had named the owner of the flat who was, by implication, also owner of the video; he had provided the name of the man who carried out the killing; he had described events on the video in detail; he had provided the approximate age and the first name of the dead boy.</p> <p>Dutch police said it was not enough: without the full name of a victim, they would not begin an investigation. Having fought their way through the swamp of inertia which surrounds British policing and prosecution of child abuse, the Bristol detectives had now hit the deeper swamp of virtual paralysis that afflicts its international policing. Within their own jurisdictions, there are now specialist paedophilia detectives - for example, in London and Amsterdam - who will work relentlessly to lock up predatory child abusers.</p> <p>But when they try to move abroad, the potentially powerful machine starts to misfire. The result is that there is now a flourishing underground trade in boys who are being exported from the economic chaos of eastern Europe, as well as from the streets of London, to be put to work in the sex industry of western Europe. And no effective police operation to deal with it.</p> <p>Predatory paedophiles cross whatever borders they like in order to pursue their obsessions; the police who might follow them are almost always trapped within their own narrow jurisdictions, partly by differences in law and procedure, partly because they lack the manpower and money to work internationally. There is an exception to this rule of parochialism, in the highly funded war against drugs, but in the perverse world of modern policing, the trafficking, rape and alleged murder of children has a far lower priority.</p> <p>We have uncovered an international paedophile ring whose roots spring from Amsterdam, where, in the late 1980s, a group of British paedophiles set up a colony, exploiting the freedom of the city's gay community as cover to make a business of their fantasies.</p> <p><b> Legal front</b><br> One of the first to do so was Alan Williams, the \"Welsh Witch\", who already had a vicious history of abusing boys in south Wales. Williams arrived in Amsterdam in 1988, aged 21, and soon set himself up as the manager of a gay brothel called Boys Club 21 at 21 Spuistraat, near the central station. Across the road at number 44, another British paedophile, a chubby Londoner named Warwick Spinks, then aged 25, was running a similar club called the Gay Palace. Both clubs had a legal business, running a bar and offering the services of adult male prostitutes.</p> <p>But Williams and Spinks had much crueller interests. Williams had fled to the Netherlands after being convicted in Britain of indecent assaults on boys. In Amsterdam, he boasted of the day in south Wales when he had seen a 10-year-old boy on his bike, grabbed him, raped him, and, when he cried, strangled him. From Boys Clubs 21, he organised the importing of boys from Cardiff and London, inflicting intense violence on any who defied him.</p> <p>Spinks had been running a mail order pornography business from Brighton, before he moved to Amsterdam, where he pioneered the trafficking of boys as young as 10 - first, from the streets of London, and, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, from the poverty of eastern Europe. Having brought them to Amsterdam, he used these \"chickens\" himself, sold them into the brothels or through escort agencies and put them in front of the camera. Some resisted, some ran away, but most were made to comply through the removal of their passports and doses of drugs and violence.</p> <p>By 1990, these two clubs on Spuistraat, together with Boys for Men, De Boys, the Blue Boy and the Why Not, had become the busiest watering holes in the international paedophile jungle. Dutch police estimated there were 250 paedophiles involved in the production of child pornography in Amsterdam with an unknown floating population of child sex tourists from all over the world - and it was the British who formed the hard core consumers: Stephen Smith, who had helped to found the Paedophile Information Exchange, fled there when police in England prosecuted the organisation; Russell Tricker, now 58, a former private school teacher who was convicted of child sex offences in the UK, used his job as a coach driver to ferry suitable boys from London; John Broomhall opened a porn shop on Spuistraat and was caught with more than 1,000 copies of videos of under-aged boys; Mark Enfield, now 41, sold a video of himself abusing a drugged boy.</p> <p>Alan Williams introduced two paedophile friends from Wales, John Gay and Lee Tucker, both of whom were to become central targets for Bristol detectives. The two men found they could sell Welsh boys into the clubs on Spuistraat and then make more money by investing in child pornography. They bought video equipment, set up TAG Films, and visited Amsterdam regularly to make films, which they sold through distributors in the US and Germany. At the time, Dutch law punished production of child pornography with a maximum sentence of only three months.</p> <p>By October 1990, detectives on the old obscene publications squad at Scotland Yard were picking up worrying signals. An informant told them that someone called Alan Williams was trafficking boys into Amsterdam and that Williams had asked him to smuggle a child porn video back into the UK. Another informant told how he had smuggled a dozen tapes in the opposite direction: they had been produced, he believed, in north London, equipped with a bondage room for boys. He had delivered the tapes in Amsterdam to \"Alan from Cardiff\" at Boys Club 21. The informant said he had visited the Gay Palace across the road, where he watched videos of boys in bondage, aged 11 to 14, being buggered by masked men.</p> <p>Soon, other informants were offering more detail. One man said he had seen Warwick Spinks selling a special video for \u00a34,000. It showed a boy whom he thought was only eight or nine being sexually abused and tortured by two men. But the most startling allegations came from a gay man, \"Frank\", who had gone to Amsterdam in July 1990 and found himself caught up in this paedophile underworld. In 1993, he spoke to the same officers at Scotland Yard.</p> <p>Frank told police that Warwick Spinks had invited him to come on a trip to the Canaries, where he had suggested Frank should help him sell videos and showed him a sample. Frank said he watched in growing horror as the video played out a murder - a boy who seemed to be no older than 12 was beaten and attacked with needles, before being castrated and cut open with a knife. The video seemed to have been shot in a barn, and detectives later learned that Williams and his friends had been talking about making a video in a barn that belonged to a German from one of the Spuistraat clubs.</p> <p>Scotland Yard was in a difficult position: the informants were British and so was Spinks, who by this time had left Amsterdam and was living in Hastings, East Sussex. But everything else in the story was scattered round Europe. After long negotiations within Scotland Yard and with their counterparts in the Netherlands, the detectives set up Operation Framework, and, as the Guardian reported in 1997, they recruited an undercover officer to pose as a child abuser and befriend Warwick Spinks in England.</p> <p>In a series of meetings, Spinks described how he picked up boys in Dresden, in Bratislava in the Czech Republic, and in Poland, where, he claimed, they cost only 10p. The undercover officer asked Spinks if he could get him a sado-masochistic video featuring boys as young as 10, and Spinks replied that he knew people in Amsterdam who could: \"I know, well I knew, some people who were involved in making snuff movies and how they did it was, they only sold them in limited editions, made 10 copies or something, 10 very rich customers in America, who paid $5,000 each or something like that\".</p> <p>Spinks divulged no more about the video and failed to produce a copy of it. Without more evidence, Scotland Yard could not justify the expense of keeping the undercover officer or of sending officers to Amsterdam, where, in any event, they lacked police powers. They arrested Spinks in Hastings and charged him with adbucting and raping two homeless boys from the streets of London and selling one of them into a Spuistraat brothel. He was jailed for five years. But the allegation of murder would not go away. As the Guardian reported in 1997, another gay man, Edward, claimed to have seen five Amsterdam videos, each featuring the sexual torture and death of a boy. Dutch police investigated and said they could find no evidence.</p> <p>Now, Terry had offered the Bristol detectives more evidence about life on Spuistraat. He explained how John Gay and Lee Tucker set themselves up as video pornographers, first taking a group of boys to an isolated farmhouse in France, and then making visits to Amsterdam to film with the boys there. And dealing with snuff movies he told how, in 1989, he had been alone in a flat which belonged to one of the key figures in the Amsterdam paedophile scene, whom he named; he had found a video and watched as it played out a murder - a boy was beaten before being castrated and cut open with a knife.</p> <p>At first sight, Terry might have been describing the video Frank saw but its details differ: Frank described a video shot in a barn; Terry says his was shot in a flat. Frank described the abuse and murder of one boy; Terry says there was a second boy, who was also being abused and who was alive at the point he turned off the tape. And yet, the overlap is striking: the specific nature of the violence is identical; and Terry names the man who actually committed the killing - he is the same German whose barn was allegedly picked as a porn studio by the child porngraphers.</p> <p>Terry, Frank, Edward and Spinks certainly mixed with the paedophile colony in Amsterdam in 1989/90 and all four separately claim at least one boy was killed on video. Spinks told the undercover officer that a German boy was killed; Frank says Spinks once hinted to him that a German boy named Manny had been murdered; we have confirmed from talking to boys who worked in Spuistraat at the time that a boy of that name and nationality, then 14, did disappear. Terry, however, says he thinks the victim of the video which he saw was Dutch, named Marco and probably 16.</p> <p><b> Currying favour</b><br> At one end of the scale of possibility, every one of these men may be lying in an attempt to score favours with the police or to cause trouble for others on the Amsterdam scene, and certainly it was not unusual for boys to disappear from Spuistraat simply because they had had enough of being exploited.</p> <p>At the other end of the scale, the truth is that one or more boys was killed in a snuff movie - and the murderers have got away with it.</p> <p>The Bristol detectives can get no further. The Dutch say they will not investigate, and Avon and Somerset police have neither the funds nor the legal power to run their own inquiry in the Netherlands.</p> <p>There have been successful paedophilia operations between British and European police. Scotland Yard detectives recently have twice arrested wanted men and extradited them to the Netherlands for trial on child sex offences. Within their borders, the Dutch paedophilia unit have arrested several of the key British paedophiles, and, since January 1996, the Netherlands has introduced a tougher law, which threatens up to six years for production of child pornography. The clubs on Spuistraat are no longer the paedophile playground they were. But the wider picture is of police trapped within their borders with the result that the European trade in boys for sexual exploitation has been allowed to grow without restraint.</p> <p>A couple of years ago, I sat in the Blue Boy club on Spuistraat, amid the dry ice and the boys in thongs, and flicked through the catalogue on the bar, offering \"truly the best boys in town\", and watched a Japanese businessman make his purchase. In search of their origins, I went to Berlin, to the Bahnhof Am Zoo, where the trains arrive from all over eastern Europe, bringing the destitute in search of a dream. A specialist social worker there, Wolfgang Werner, told me there were some 700 east European boys, aged from 11 to 17, who had ended up in the sex industry in Berlin. But, to his knowledge, many hundreds of others had been taken off on a kind of underground railroad which fanned out to Zurich and Hamburg and Frankfurt, and, most of all, to Rotterdam and Amsterdam.</p> <p>Werner told me, for example, about the Romanian boys who had been sold by their parents to a wandering Polish criminal, who had paid cash for some and a bottle of vodka for another, before putting them on to the streets of Berlin.</p> <p>I followed the trail of two men, Peter Goetjes and Lutz Edelman, identified as traffickers in the Berlin press. Eventually, I spoke to a friend of theirs, who said that, of course, they had been trafficking. They must have sold 150 between them, before Goetjes was caught on the Polish border in the summer of 1992 with a boy in his boot. Goetjes was charged with smuggling, released on bail and then drove away and never came back for his trial. About that time, he and Edelman stopped trafficking, not so much because of Goetjes's arrest but because they had been told some of the boys were being used in snuff movies. Plenty of others carried on.</p> <p><b> Unheeded warning</b><br> In May 1995, Bjorn Eriksson, then president of Interpol and chief of the Swedish police, told a conference on cross-border crime that organised paedophile networks were operating across European frontiers and as many as 30,000 paedophiles were believed to be linked to organisations or publications throughout Europe. His warning went unheeded.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, trafficking of boys from Berlin to the Netherlands hit the north European press when police belatedly tried to find out what had happened to a 12-year-old Berliner, Manuel Schadwald, who went missing in July 1993. The Berlin police had simply listed him as a runaway. By 1997, however, Dutch journalists had dug out a history of sightings which suggested he had been put to work in a brothel in Rotterdam, run by a German, Lothar Glandorf, now 36. After ignoring complaints for 18 months, Rotterdam police targeted him and found he had been selling hundreds of boys. Of those they could trace, nearly half were under 16.</p> <p>The Guardian has obtained an extraordinary report which was produced by Rotterdam police. It captures some of the ruthlessness of life in the city's boy brothels: \"Even if Glandorf knew the perversions of a customer, he would still send a boy to a customer who had a preference for sado-masochism.\"</p> <p>In the midst of all this, Rotterdam police were looking for Manuel Schadwald. Their report reveals three boys had run away from Glandorf's world and reported sighting the missing Berliner. Police logs leaked to a Dutch TV programme, Netwerk, reveal that one night, three Rotterdam surveillance officers saw Glandorf with a boy all three believed to be Manuel Schadwald but they failed to rescue him: they were reluctant to break cover for fear of jeopardising their operation. With the Dutch and German press baying for action, police in the two countries set about trying to find him - four years after his disappearance. They failed.</p> <p>The same cross-border weakness persists. Investigating Glandorf, the Rotterdam police found that British paedophiles were routinely using his brothels, but they never sent a copy of their report to Scotland Yard. Glandorf had little fear of international policing. When a senior Dutch civil servant phoned him from Poland to say he was bringing back a boy, police phone taps recorded Glandorf saying: \"When you get to the bridge at the border, let him out so he can go on foot so they can't catch you.\" That was all it took.</p> <p>Within their borders, the Dutch did finally jail Glandorf for five and a half years, and yet the Amsterdam paedophiles remain relaxed. Some have resettled in Prague, where the law is lax. The trains still pull into the Bahnhof Am Zoo with their consignments of vulnerable children. The international boy business is alive and well, and, quite possibly, getting away with murder.</p> <p>\u0095 Identities of all police informants have been disguised.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A year after Bristol detectives finally started to unravel the ring of paedophiles who had been abusing children there for up to 20 years, they found an informant with an alarming story. The man, whom we will call Terry, had a long history of sexually abusing boys. He did not come from Bristol but, by chance, he had come across some of the paedophiles the detectives were investigating - in Amsterdam, where he said they had become involved with a group of exiled British child abusers who had succeeded in commercialising their sexual obsession. The exiled paedophiles were trafficking boys from other countries; running legitimate gay brothels and selling under-aged boys \"under the counter\"; they had branched out into the production of child pornography. And they had killed some of them. One boy had simply been shot through the head, Terry said: he had been causing trouble and had been executed in front of several pae dophiles. Another, he believed, had been thrown into one of the canals. But the one about whom he spoke the most was a boy who had been tortured and killed in the most painful fashion in the course of producing a pornographic video. Terry said he had seen most of the video himself and had vomited before he could reach the end. The few detectives who specialise in the investigation of child abuse invariably say the same thing about \"snuff\" movies: they have often heard of them, sometimes pursued them but never found one. The videos remain one of the great unsolved mysteries of the burgeoning underworld of international sexual exploitation. Twice told tale Terry's account was so hideous as to invite disbelief. It was clearly possible that he was inventing the story in an attempt to curry favour with the detectives as they turned over Bristol's paedophile subculture. And yet the detectives discovered that the allegation had been made before. Not just once but repeatedly, evidence had come to the attention of police in England and the Netherlands, that, for pleasure and profit, some of the exiled paedophiles in Amsterdam had mur dered boys in front of the camera. Some of the evidence had been pursued. Some of it had been ignored. None of it had led to a murder charge. For a short while, the Bristol detectives thought they might be able to make progress in tracking down the truth; but when two of them flew to Amsterdam in the autumn of 1998 to pass on their information to Dutch officers, they hit a wall. Terry had described the flat in Amsterdam where he had seen the video; he had named the owner of the flat who was, by implication, also owner of the video; he had provided the name of the man who carried out the killing; he had described events on the video in detail; he had provided the approximate age and the first name of the dead boy. Dutch police said it was not enough: without the full name of a victim, they would not begin an investigation. Having fought their way through the swamp of inertia which surrounds British policing and prosecution of child abuse, the Bristol detectives had now hit the deeper swamp of virtual paralysis that afflicts its international policing. Within their own jurisdictions, there are now specialist paedophilia detectives - for example, in London and Amsterdam - who will work relentlessly to lock up predatory child abusers. But when they try to move abroad, the potentially powerful machine starts to misfire. The result is that there is now a flourishing underground trade in boys who are being exported from the economic chaos of eastern Europe, as well as from the streets of London, to be put to work in the sex industry of western Europe. And no effective police operation to deal with it. Predatory paedophiles cross whatever borders they like in order to pursue their obsessions; the police who might follow them are almost always trapped within their own narrow jurisdictions, partly by differences in law and procedure, partly because they lack the manpower and money to work internationally. There is an exception to this rule of parochialism, in the highly funded war against drugs, but in the perverse world of modern policing, the trafficking, rape and alleged murder of children has a far lower priority. We have uncovered an international paedophile ring whose roots spring from Amsterdam, where, in the late 1980s, a group of British paedophiles set up a colony, exploiting the freedom of the city's gay community as cover to make a business of their fantasies. Legal front One of the first to do so was Alan Williams, the \"Welsh Witch\", who already had a vicious history of abusing boys in south Wales. Williams arrived in Amsterdam in 1988, aged 21, and soon set himself up as the manager of a gay brothel called Boys Club 21 at 21 Spuistraat, near the central station. Across the road at number 44, another British paedophile, a chubby Londoner named Warwick Spinks, then aged 25, was running a similar club called the Gay Palace. Both clubs had a legal business, running a bar and offering the services of adult male prostitutes. But Williams and Spinks had much crueller interests. Williams had fled to the Netherlands after being convicted in Britain of indecent assaults on boys. In Amsterdam, he boasted of the day in south Wales when he had seen a 10-year-old boy on his bike, grabbed him, raped him, and, when he cried, strangled him. From Boys Clubs 21, he organised the importing of boys from Cardiff and London, inflicting intense violence on any who defied him. Spinks had been running a mail order pornography business from Brighton, before he moved to Amsterdam, where he pioneered the trafficking of boys as young as 10 - first, from the streets of London, and, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, from the poverty of eastern Europe. Having brought them to Amsterdam, he used these \"chickens\" himself, sold them into the brothels or through escort agencies and put them in front of the camera. Some resisted, some ran away, but most were made to comply through the removal of their passports and doses of drugs and violence. By 1990, these two clubs on Spuistraat, together with Boys for Men, De Boys, the Blue Boy and the Why Not, had become the busiest watering holes in the international paedophile jungle. Dutch police estimated there were 250 paedophiles involved in the production of child pornography in Amsterdam with an unknown floating population of child sex tourists from all over the world - and it was the British who formed the hard core consumers: Stephen Smith, who had helped to found the Paedophile Information Exchange, fled there when police in England prosecuted the organisation; Russell Tricker, now 58, a former private school teacher who was convicted of child sex offences in the UK, used his job as a coach driver to ferry suitable boys from London; John Broomhall opened a porn shop on Spuistraat and was caught with more than 1,000 copies of videos of under-aged boys; Mark Enfield, now 41, sold a video of himself abusing a drugged boy. Alan Williams introduced two paedophile friends from Wales, John Gay and Lee Tucker, both of whom were to become central targets for Bristol detectives. The two men found they could sell Welsh boys into the clubs on Spuistraat and then make more money by investing in child pornography. They bought video equipment, set up TAG Films, and visited Amsterdam regularly to make films, which they sold through distributors in the US and Germany. At the time, Dutch law punished production of child pornography with a maximum sentence of only three months. By October 1990, detectives on the old obscene publications squad at Scotland Yard were picking up worrying signals. An informant told them that someone called Alan Williams was trafficking boys into Amsterdam and that Williams had asked him to smuggle a child porn video back into the UK. Another informant told how he had smuggled a dozen tapes in the opposite direction: they had been produced, he believed, in north London, equipped with a bondage room for boys. He had delivered the tapes in Amsterdam to \"Alan from Cardiff\" at Boys Club 21. The informant said he had visited the Gay Palace across the road, where he watched videos of boys in bondage, aged 11 to 14, being buggered by masked men. Soon, other informants were offering more detail. One man said he had seen Warwick Spinks selling a special video for \u00a34,000. It showed a boy whom he thought was only eight or nine being sexually abused and tortured by two men. But the most startling allegations came from a gay man, \"Frank\", who had gone to Amsterdam in July 1990 and found himself caught up in this paedophile underworld. In 1993, he spoke to the same officers at Scotland Yard. Frank told police that Warwick Spinks had invited him to come on a trip to the Canaries, where he had suggested Frank should help him sell videos and showed him a sample. Frank said he watched in growing horror as the video played out a murder - a boy who seemed to be no older than 12 was beaten and attacked with needles, before being castrated and cut open with a knife. The video seemed to have been shot in a barn, and detectives later learned that Williams and his friends had been talking about making a video in a barn that belonged to a German from one of the Spuistraat clubs. Scotland Yard was in a difficult position: the informants were British and so was Spinks, who by this time had left Amsterdam and was living in Hastings, East Sussex. But everything else in the story was scattered round Europe. After long negotiations within Scotland Yard and with their counterparts in the Netherlands, the detectives set up Operation Framework, and, as the Guardian reported in 1997, they recruited an undercover officer to pose as a child abuser and befriend Warwick Spinks in England. In a series of meetings, Spinks described how he picked up boys in Dresden, in Bratislava in the Czech Republic, and in Poland, where, he claimed, they cost only 10p. The undercover officer asked Spinks if he could get him a sado-masochistic video featuring boys as young as 10, and Spinks replied that he knew people in Amsterdam who could: \"I know, well I knew, some people who were involved in making snuff movies and how they did it was, they only sold them in limited editions, made 10 copies or something, 10 very rich customers in America, who paid $5,000 each or something like that\". Spinks divulged no more about the video and failed to produce a copy of it. Without more evidence, Scotland Yard could not justify the expense of keeping the undercover officer or of sending officers to Amsterdam, where, in any event, they lacked police powers. They arrested Spinks in Hastings and charged him with adbucting and raping two homeless boys from the streets of London and selling one of them into a Spuistraat brothel. He was jailed for five years. But the allegation of murder would not go away. As the Guardian reported in 1997, another gay man, Edward, claimed to have seen five Amsterdam videos, each featuring the sexual torture and death of a boy. Dutch police investigated and said they could find no evidence. Now, Terry had offered the Bristol detectives more evidence about life on Spuistraat. He explained how John Gay and Lee Tucker set themselves up as video pornographers, first taking a group of boys to an isolated farmhouse in France, and then making visits to Amsterdam to film with the boys there. And dealing with snuff movies he told how, in 1989, he had been alone in a flat which belonged to one of the key figures in the Amsterdam paedophile scene, whom he named; he had found a video and watched as it played out a murder - a boy was beaten before being castrated and cut open with a knife. At first sight, Terry might have been describing the video Frank saw but its details differ: Frank described a video shot in a barn; Terry says his was shot in a flat. Frank described the abuse and murder of one boy; Terry says there was a second boy, who was also being abused and who was alive at the point he turned off the tape. And yet, the overlap is striking: the specific nature of the violence is identical; and Terry names the man who actually committed the killing - he is the same German whose barn was allegedly picked as a porn studio by the child porngraphers. Terry, Frank, Edward and Spinks certainly mixed with the paedophile colony in Amsterdam in 1989/90 and all four separately claim at least one boy was killed on video. Spinks told the undercover officer that a German boy was killed; Frank says Spinks once hinted to him that a German boy named Manny had been murdered; we have confirmed from talking to boys who worked in Spuistraat at the time that a boy of that name and nationality, then 14, did disappear. Terry, however, says he thinks the victim of the video which he saw was Dutch, named Marco and probably 16. Currying favour At one end of the scale of possibility, every one of these men may be lying in an attempt to score favours with the police or to cause trouble for others on the Amsterdam scene, and certainly it was not unusual for boys to disappear from Spuistraat simply because they had had enough of being exploited. At the other end of the scale, the truth is that one or more boys was killed in a snuff movie - and the murderers have got away with it. The Bristol detectives can get no further.

      "bodyText": "A Virgin train carrying around 400 passengers derailed south of Glasgow last night, but there were no serious injuries. Four people were injured, according to Dorothy Fenwick, Railtrack's head of corporate affairs. The train, which was seven miles short of its destination, had taken 8 hours from Euston station, London. She said two passengers had suffered shock, one had a slight neck injury and one was reported to have cuts and bruises. The nine-coach train was travelling at 15mph through Mossend South junction when four carriages went off the rails at 7.05pm. The coaches remained upright, but passengers had to disembark from one of the carriages that remained on the tracks before being taken by coach to a community centre. Virgin Trains' media relations manager, Jim Rowe, said taxis had been arranged to take them home. A Railtrack Scotland spokeswoman said the line was not subject to the speed restrictions imposed on tracks throughout Britain following the Hatfield rail crash last month in which four people died. \"It was not a site identified as having gauge corner cracking, so it wasn't a site with emergency speed restrictions. The train was travelling at a slow speed through the junction, as trains normally do at that particular point.\" The Scottish secretary, John Reid, said that railway inspectors from the health and safety executive were on their way to the scene. The train, the 10.30am express, had been diverted from its usual route while Railtrack carried out repairs. Railtrack workers replaced 20 miles of track over the weekend, one mile more than expected. Nearly one-and-a-quarter miles of track was being replaced at Gamston, south of Retford, Nottinghamshire, with almost a mile of new line being laid at Knebworth, Hertfordshire. About six miles of track was being replaced on the northern section of the West Coast main line, while more than a mile and a half of track was being put in place from Bow to Bethnal Green in east London. Railtrack said this would lead to more speed restrictions being lifted although she could not say which ones or when. So far 200 speed restrictions have been lifted, but 200 miles of track still needs to be repaired. The health and safety executive was today due to publish figures showing that the number of signals passed at danger during October fell to 53, 17 fewer than the same month last year. The statistics appeared to contradict claims that speed restrictions had increased danger for passengers.",

In June, Cartier has a marquee at the Goodwood Festival of Speed where it entertains clients with champagne and hosts a classic automobile design competition.

Vallie Watson, director of Party Professionals, has been arranging them for 16 years, and knows a thing or two about the minefield that the office get-together presents. \"Often you'll get employees groaning inwardly and not wanting to go because it's usually a thrown-together affair, allocated as yet another chore to an already overworked secretary.

Make sure the atmosphere isn't so terrifying that everyone hits the bottle. </p> <p>\"Also, try to get your Christmas party in early so that everyone hasn't become jaded by all the other parties they've been to.

But, say the experts, do try. </p> <p>\"Basically, Christmas parties are a big thank-you from employers to workers. So just make sure that you don't behave in a way that you may regret the next day. It's a fine line between relaxing and enjoying yourself and overdoing it,\" says Parkhouse.

Two years later I landed my current assistant producer role with a major independent company. The job is fantastic but I work incredibly long hours and constantly have to think on my feet. I do see famous people regularly, but I am so engrossed in making everything run smoothly that there is little time for being starstruck.\" </p> <p>Harrington confesses that a certain ruthlessness permeates the TV business as chief producers won't acknowledge the words \"no\" or \"can't\". \"I've been asked to find six contestants for a Blind Date-style broadcast and devise a children's activity for a kiddies' slot for a cable TV show, all in less than 48 hours. I tend to live on my nerves a bit so it suits me, but I've seen others completely crash and burn under the stress of it,\" she admits. </p> <p>A willingness to endure long working hours on a moderate salary is vital, especially when set against the dream salary packages offered to graduates entering the traditional corporate workplace. Whatever glamour does exist is put sharply into focus by the frenetic deadlines, and success can be guaranteed only for those shrewd enough to know when to make the right moves. But if you do so, you won't look back.</p>",

Julie Harrington also had her heart set on a job in TV after graduating. \"I'd always toyed with the idea of becoming a news presenter,\" she says. \"But when I found out that you needed to be a trained journalist to present news at a national level, I decided to investigate other positions. \"I started as a PA to the head of production within an independent TV production company which was a good starting point for learning how the business worked. Two years later I landed my current assistant producer role with a major independent company. The job is fantastic but I work incredibly long hours and constantly have to think on my feet. I do see famous people regularly, but I am so engrossed in making everything run smoothly that there is little time for being starstruck.\" Harrington confesses that a certain ruthlessness permeates the TV business as chief producers won't acknowledge the words \"no\" or \"can't\". \"I've been asked to find six contestants for a Blind Date-style broadcast and devise a children's activity for a kiddies' slot for a cable TV show, all in less than 48 hours. I tend to live on my nerves a bit so it suits me, but I've seen others completely crash and burn under the stress of it,\" she admits. A willingness to endure long working hours on a moderate salary is vital, especially when set against the dream salary packages offered to graduates entering the traditional corporate workplace. Whatever glamour does exist is put sharply into focus by the frenetic deadlines, and success can be guaranteed only for those shrewd enough to know when to make the right moves. But if you do so, you won't look back.",

In Japan he was able to talk to the US vice-president Al Gore directly across the table. Mr Gore in turn talked on the telephone to President Clinton who told him to accept compromises. Last week it was different. First the Americans had asked for ever larger and more impossible loopholes. This had begun seriously to damage the credibility of the agreement and angered many in the European governments, which have become greener in the past three years. The most notable was Ms Voynet, a fiery green party minister in the French coalition. Many environmental campaigners backed Mr Prescott yesterday, saying that he was right to try to make a deal with the Americans, however bad, because under a Bush presidency any agreement might be impossible. The environment minister Michael Meacher remained hopeful that the European environment ministers meeting on December 17 might salvage something out of the Prescott compromise and come to a political deal with the Americans before the end of the Clinton presidency in January. But that possibility looks remote. The next opportunity comes in May. Jan Pronk, the Dutch environment minister and president of the Hague talks, officially adjourned the discussions until then. But the next big political meeting is not until this time next year, by which time Mr Prescott's climate deal days may be over.",

Three judges headed by the vice-chancellor Sir Andrew Morritt, head of the high court's chancery division, adjourned an appeal last Thursday to notify the government that they propose to declare the Consumer Credit Act 1974 incompatible with the convention.

The refugee influx comes at an awkward time for the UN chief administrator in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner. He was due to meet the new Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, in Vienna today. They are both attending a summit held by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Belgrade has been putting more pressure on the UN in Kosovo to clamp down on the guerrillas. On Friday afternoon it announced its own three-day deadline - due to end today - for attacks to cease. Earlier last week Zoran Djindjic, one of Yugoslavia's most senior politicians, warned that if the international community continued to tolerate the situation it would lead to \"full-scale war\". K-For's spokesman, Flight Lieutenant Mark Whitty, said that the guerrillas and the Serbian authorities held talks at the weekend. K-For officials helped to broker the ceasefire signed on Friday. The guerrillas showed no sign of relinquishing any territory as the deadline approached on Sunday. Groups of soldiers carrying an assortment of machine guns and mortars manned the hilltops around Konculj. A local commander, Vullnet Ibishi, said nine tanks and 10 armoured personnel carriers, plus two trucks carrying paramilitaries, were seen on Saturday afternoon near Lucane, the next village down the valley. \"We'll have to see what will happen. We are not going to do anything but we don't trust them,\" he said.

Paddy Ashdown's recently published diaries showed just how close that relationship became before the last election. Since May 1997, the Liberal Democrats moved to share power with Labour in Wales and Scotland, as well as to sit on cabinet committees at Westminster. But at the same time claims that the party is becoming too cosy with Labour have become more frequent.</p> <p>The claims are wrong. Evidence from Liberal Democrat voting in both the Commons and the Lords shows exactly the opposite. Indeed, as claims about the relationship being too close grow ever louder, so the Liberal Democrats have become less supportive of Labour.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats began this parliament just as they ended the last: voting strongly in support of Labour, on both the principle and detail of legislation. Despite sitting on the opposi tion benches, they were more often than not to be found on the side of the government. As well as their own MPs, the government could count on Liberal Democrat MPs in around six out of every ten whipped votes in the first session of the Commons.</p> <p>Each succeeding session has seen the Liberal Democrats less and less likely to vote with Labour. By the second session they were backing Labour in just under half of all votes. The third session has seen support fall to just over 40% of votes.</p> <p>On the basis of their voting in the first session the Liberal Democrats had a view of the Labour party similar to the old Chinese communist view of Stalin: that he was 60% right but 40% wrong. They have now reversed their stance: Labour is 40% right and 60% wrong.</p> <p>Not only that, but the Liberal Democrats have become more willing to vote with the Tories. In the first session, they voted with them in just over a quarter of votes (it was, as one of their MPs said at the time, \"difficult to vote with the Tories, because they are so awful\"). The second session saw the Liberal Democrats back the Tories in 40% of votes, with a rise to 43% in the third session.</p> <p>The Tories have clearly become less awful and Labour more awful, because as the chart shows, the Liberal Democrats are now more likely to be voting with the Tories than with Labour. Either way, the result has been that the Liberal Democrats are now beginning to vote the way we might expect opposition parties to: against the government. If the Liberal Democrats ever were Labour's poodles, they are not any more.</p> <p>Yet this cooling of relations is not evidence of the abandonment of the Liberal Democrats' policy of \"constructive opposition\". Breaking these figures down reveals that the decline in the frequency with which the Liberal Democrats vote with the government is not constant across all types of vote. When it comes to votes on the principle of government legislation - at second or third reading - the Liberal Democrats are still almost as supportive of the government now as they were in 1997, voting with Labour in more than seven out of ten votes. The problem comes with the votes on the detail.</p> <p>Of course, we might expect the Liberal Democrats to be less supportive when it comes to votes on the fine print of bills. Indeed, proponents of constructive opposition would argue exactly this: that that Liberal Democrats should support the broad thrust of government policy whenever possible - not opposing bills for the sake of opposing them - but then try to improve the detail by proposing and voting for amendments wherever possible. And this always happened, even when the relationship with the government was at its strongest.</p> <p>But the decline in Liberal Democrat support for the government has been sharpest on these votes. When it comes to votes on the detail of legislation, we now find the Liberal Democrats voting with Labour in just a third of votes.

The legislation, in the Transport Bill, could fall if peers again reject the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) plan. The sources, close to John Prescott, deputy prime minister and champion of the privatisation, said the continued opposition of Tory and Liberal peers, backed by dissident Labour members of the Lords, could destroy three years of Labour's attempts to build an integrated transport policy. This includes the introduction of congestion charging, which will curb car use in big cities, and the setting up of the strategic rail authority, the one big change in Labour's railway plan, designed to exert more control over Railtrack. Some rail managers said last night that the collapse of the transport legislation would be a blessing in disguise after the Hatfield rail crash, but it would be regarded as a considerable political setback for Mr Prescott, leaving him with nothing after four years in the job. Tonight's vote follows fresh safety warnings about the impact of a sale with a NATS briefing paper disclosing that cuts of up to \u00a3165m over five years could be imposed. Pilots, air traffic controllers and the public oppose privatisation, but the government wants to sell off 51% of the service to one of three bidders, arguing that the system is badly managed and needs considerable investment. Invoking the Parliament Act to force through the privatisation could postpone any sale until after the general election. \u0095 The former Tory transport minister Steven Norris yesterday gave a powerful hint he could become chairman of Railtrack.

Far from being a sore loser who doesn't know when to accept defeat, the vice-president can now present himself to his party as a martyr being robbed of the White House by a Republican conspiracy.</p> <p>A week ago, there was real concern that Democrats would begin to abandon Mr Gore today if the certified results went against him. But over the weekend, intensive discussions between Gore advisers and senior Democrat officials around the US left the vice-president's camp confident that the party will stand by him for another round of actions in the courts this week.</p> <p>\"The Republicans have upped the ante. They have been so outrageous in their conduct that they have hardened resolve among the Democrats,\" said Democratic congressman Martin Frost yesterday.</p> <p>\"The Republican leadership is doing a lot to put steel into the Democrats' backbone,\" said party pollster Geoff Garin.</p> <p>The mood in the Gore camp is sufficiently confident that there are even some advisers who positively want Mr Bush and his entourage to claim victory and to start behaving like winners this week. These advisers think that moves of this kind offend the public, as they seemed to do when Mr Bush tried - and quickly abandoned - the approach immediately after the election.</p> <p>\"I don't think the American people buy it one bit,\" said one adviser. \"I think it aggravates them.\"</p> <p>Whatever the difficulties, and they are self-evidently formidable, the Gore camp is driven from the very top by the unshakeable belief that their man won the election in Florida and in the nation as a whole. Mr Gore, advisers say, is sometimes embarrassed by the legal machinations to which he has had to resort, but he believes absolutely that more people went to the polls to vote for him than for Mr Bush. Unlike many of those around him, Mr Gore's determination to prove his point and claim his prize has been unswerving.</p>",

Far from being a sore loser who doesn't know when to accept defeat, the vice-president can now present himself to his party as a martyr being robbed of the White House by a Republican conspiracy. A week ago, there was real concern that Democrats would begin to abandon Mr Gore today if the certified results went against him. But over the weekend, intensive discussions between Gore advisers and senior Democrat officials around the US left the vice-president's camp confident that the party will stand by him for another round of actions in the courts this week. \"The Republicans have upped the ante. They have been so outrageous in their conduct that they have hardened resolve among the Democrats,\" said Democratic congressman Martin Frost yesterday. \"The Republican leadership is doing a lot to put steel into the Democrats' backbone,\" said party pollster Geoff Garin. The mood in the Gore camp is sufficiently confident that there are even some advisers who positively want Mr Bush and his entourage to claim victory and to start behaving like winners this week. These advisers think that moves of this kind offend the public, as they seemed to do when Mr Bush tried - and quickly abandoned - the approach immediately after the election. \"I don't think the American people buy it one bit,\" said one adviser. \"I think it aggravates them.\" Whatever the difficulties, and they are self-evidently formidable, the Gore camp is driven from the very top by the unshakeable belief that their man won the election in Florida and in the nation as a whole. Mr Gore, advisers say, is sometimes embarrassed by the legal machinations to which he has had to resort, but he believes absolutely that more people went to the polls to vote for him than for Mr Bush. Unlike many of those around him, Mr Gore's determination to prove his point and claim his prize has been unswerving.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair is considering the creation of a Department for Social Inclusion, headed by a cabinet minister, to spearhead a revived anti-poverty drive in the most deprived areas if Labour wins a second term. The formation of the Whitehall ministry to coordinate policies intended to help the \"underclass\" is under discussion within Downing Street as the prime minister considers what should be in Labour's election manifesto. Mr Blair plans to make poverty a key election issue, a commitment that would be welcomed in Labour's heartlands and establish clear blue water between the government and Tory leader William Hague. A No 10 official said the new ministry would be carved out of John Prescott's sprawling Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Hilary Armstrong, minister for local government and the regions in the department, who is highly rated by the prime minister, has been tipped in government circles for promotion to the post. The department would take over and expand the role of the cabinet office's social exclusion unit and work closely with other ministries, including social security, health and education, as well as the Treasury. The department would be named social inclusion rather than social exclusion to put the emphasis on positive efforts. It could be responsible for community regeneration and town hall affairs. The environment department classifies 1,370 estates as \"run down\" and suffering from multiple problems including high unemployment, bad housing, low education standards and ill health. Establishing the department would be seen as an acknowledgment that the social exclusion unit has not been as successful as the prime minister envisaged, as well as evidence of Mr Blair's commitment to tackling poverty. Headed by Moira Wallace, a former Treasury high-flyer and Downing Street private secretary, the social exclusion unit is staffed by some 40 of the brightest civil servants. A string of studies and initiatives, including an \u00a3800m neighbourhood renewal scheme, have been produced but the unit has been the vic tim of \"turf wars\" with departments. A review last year by cabinet office officials and KPMG consultants concluded the unit's work \"has been on the whole less enthusiastically received inside government than outside\". Appointing a cabinet minister to run a new department, said the No 10 official, would \"send a clear signal to the rest of Whitehall as well as the country at large that Labour is serious about ending social deprivation and exclusion\". With an election expected in May after Labour's three byelection victories last week, a decision on whether to create the department could be taken early in the new year. Mr Blair has shown a marked reluctance to reform Whitehall but setting up a social inclusion department would partly undo one of the changes he did introduce after merging the environment and transport departments. Created specifically for Mr Prescott as deputy prime minister after the last election, it faces another shake-up after the next election. In addition to the possibility of urban affairs being transferred to a new department, Stephen Byers, the trade secretary, believes the eight regional development agencies would fit into the Department of Trade and Industry. Some ministers in other departments believe the environment and transport portfolios should be separated to reduce the department to a manageable scale while others think they should remain united. Ms Armstrong and Mr Prescott have clashed over English elected mayors, which she is keener on than he is, and regional government. She was slapped down by her boss in public early this year after voicing doubts about English regional assemblies. Some advisers close to the environment department, who could see the logic of an all-embracing department when it was formed, now believe it is running out of time because it is too big. One longstanding Westminster ally of Mr Prescott said: \"John has had to deal with flak from N0 10, and its policy wonks, while pulling together a lot of other things, and frankly he's knackered. After the election we all expect he'll move on to something else, maybe the party chairmanship, while keeping his deputy's role in the cabinet.\"",

Get a mentor. That's the message from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which is urging organisations to introduce the concept at support staff level. </p> <p>In fact, although mentoring is traditionally associated with the advancement of managers rather than secretaries, the reality is already changing fast. Professor Alan Smithers, director for education and employment research at the University of Liverpool, believes there are two reasons for this. \"First, the secretarial role has grown in leaps and bounds in terms of responsibility and status. With layers of middle management disappearing and with the recent downsizing of companies, the role now includes overseeing information technology as well as consulting, marketing, personnel and managing small projects. Not surprisingly, this increasing workload requires an increasing amount of training and development.\" </p> <p>In turn, he says, managers rely on their support staff more than ever. \"That's where the second reason comes in. If they want to be the best managers, they are recognising that they need to have the best secretaries which, again, comes down to training and development.\" </p> <p>So what is mentoring? \"An experienced person aiding the progression of someone less experienced,\" explains Alan Fowler, author of Get More - and More Results - From Your People (CIPD, \u00a39.95). \"The term originates from Greek mythology - Mentor being the friend to whom Ulysses entrusted the education of his son before he went off on his odyssey. In the 1970s, it started to become a formal component of forward thinking businesses and today creating a mentor/mentee relationship is recognised as one of the most effective ways of making a business competitive.\" </p> <p>The theory is that competitive advantage is dependent on talent, and talent is best advanced through mentoring, explains Michael Robson, who helped to set up a mentoring network in south-east England. \"A one-to-one relationship, usually between a senior and junior employer, mentoring isn't simply about training, coaching or friendship,\" he says. \"A mentor is a 'corporate godparent' who teaches the business rules that aren't in the textbooks.\" </p> <p>A good mentor will advise you on the ins and outs of office politics; will be a sounding board for your concerns and tensions; and will be your role model. Little wonder that research shows the relationship works best if you are relatively close in age and outside the mentor's direct line of command. A secretary, a top PA, or an office manager will serve the role best. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a good scheme will put you in touch, advise you on how to get the best out of your relationship, and demand that you meet at least every six weeks for 15 minutes. Perhaps you'll choose to shadow your mentor for an hour or so a week, or maybe you'll just meet for lunch occasionally. Perhaps the relationship will last six months, or maybe you'll keep it up for a couple of years. </p> <p>Rochelle Anderson, a 26-year-old PA from Buckinghamshire, whose employer is considering introducing a formal mentoring scheme, can see the benefits. \"Outstanding administrative skills cannot be learned simply by doing the job. You need to watch, hear about and assess the experiences of someone who has already made it to the top. Since you also need to know what makes the particular company you're working for tick, that person needs to be working for the same employer as you.\" </p> <p>Julie Withers, a 23-year-old PA who was mentored in her previous job, agrees. \"You arrive in an organisation with a set of skills, but no experience in that particular business. An approachable, experienced voice can mean everything: improve your self-confidence, teach you how to cope with the organisational culture and help you to advance your career.\" </p> <p>While the CIPD advocates formal schemes, it is quick to point out that for secretaries who work for a company that hasn't yet seen the light, all is not lost. \"It's increasingly common for staff to create an informal scheme of their own,\" explains Angela Baron, adviser to the CIPD. \"They simply find a good role model and ask if they can come and talk to them from time to time about the way they do things.\" </p> <p>David Clutterbuck, author of Everyone Needs a Mentor (CIPD, \u00a310.95), claims this is most likely to work where benefits are recognised as two-way. \"Grooming a promising young employee can be a challenging and stimulating experience for a mentor, especially if his or her own career has reached a temporary or permanent plateau,\" he explains. </p> <p>Irrespective of whether mentoring involves an official scheme or a natural process, Fowler claims a mentor should have certain key characteristics. \"Apart from having job-related skills, they need to be fully committed to the role. That's why they should always be volunteers rather than being under any obligation. Communication skills are essential, but mentors should also be patient and avoid offering solutions too readily. After all, it is their job to help the mentee find their own solutions rather than plunging straight into, 'If I were you . . .' Finally, mentors should recognise that they, too, can learn from the process and treat it as part of their own continuous development.\" </p> <p>Mentees, for their part, should be honest, open-minded and willing to learn. \"They should also be prepared to explore their weaknesses and create a high level of self-awareness, while at the same time challenging their mentor's views where necessary,\" says Fowler. </p> <p>Studies show that mentoring tends to be most effective when it involves women - both as mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Women are more likely to offer advice with the proviso, \"don't feel you have to take it\"; whereas men have a tendency to exaggerate their abilities and are less likely to take advice on board. </p> <p>The problem is, of course, that since there are fewer women at the top than men, there are fewer female mentors available. Nevertheless, organisations in the United States believe they have found a solution - turning mentoring on its head. \"Female secretaries are mentoring male executives,\" explains Clutterbuck. The idea is that the women, who are at the coalface of an organisation, teach the men, who spend all day in the corner office, what the nuts and bolts of the company are all about. \"The result is that the secretary gets recognition and the executives are less isolated,\" says Clutterbuck. </p> <p>Nevertheless, schemes such as this prove the fruitlessness of mentoring, according to sceptics from traditionalist organisations. Mentoring reveals the worst side of American corporate culture, they say, with a lot of buzzwords and PC ideas, but few bottom-line results.

Alone, it won't bring in support staff, he admits, but it could swing the balance. \"It's vital to identify potential and create a structure for developing. If an employee realises that it is a priority to an employer, it will increase their interest in working for them. That's a measurable reward.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u0095 More than half of Britain's workers would still report for duty the next day if they won the lottery, according to research for the Industrial Society released last week. And no, not just to make sure that the holder of the office syndicate tickets hasn't skipped off to Rio, but to work. WPM is disappointed. Anything more than a tenner and she'd be off, no question. A closer look at the study, though, makes it clear that those who do go back to the daily grind have certain incentives for doing so - the most keen were those earning more than \u00a370,000 a year, of whom 70% would keep on working. A spokesman for National Lottery organisers Camelot confirmed that not all winners give up the day job: \"51% of all lottery winners who won \u00a350,000 or more have returned to work in spite of their win.\" </p> <p>WPM's thoughts, however, are with the blithe-spirited 49% who'd jack in the nine-to-five for a five-figure cheque - she'd love to know how they explain away their year(s) of madness on the CV when they return (as, presumably, they must) to the world of gainful employment.</p> <p>\u0095 Money can't buy you a better job, but it can buy you plastic surgery, and that might well be the key to that dream career, if recent research from the Guildhall University in London is to be believed. Contrary to popular images of the office (think Ally McBeal), non-attractive people do sometimes enter the world of work. And, for their efforts, these un-beautiful people are rewarded with lower salaries. An ugly man will earn just \u00a317,000 a year compared with his more facially sorted colleague, who'll rake in \u00a320,000. </p> <p>But - and who'd have thought it - it's women, and particularly women in more junior roles, who suffer the most from not meeting attractiveness targets.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 More than half of Britain's workers would still report for duty the next day if they won the lottery, according to research for the Industrial Society released last week. And no, not just to make sure that the holder of the office syndicate tickets hasn't skipped off to Rio, but to work. WPM is disappointed. Anything more than a tenner and she'd be off, no question. A closer look at the study, though, makes it clear that those who do go back to the daily grind have certain incentives for doing so - the most keen were those earning more than \u00a370,000 a year, of whom 70% would keep on working. A spokesman for National Lottery organisers Camelot confirmed that not all winners give up the day job: \"51% of all lottery winners who won \u00a350,000 or more have returned to work in spite of their win.\" WPM's thoughts, however, are with the blithe-spirited 49% who'd jack in the nine-to-five for a five-figure cheque - she'd love to know how they explain away their year(s) of madness on the CV when they return (as, presumably, they must) to the world of gainful employment. \u0095 Money can't buy you a better job, but it can buy you plastic surgery, and that might well be the key to that dream career, if recent research from the Guildhall University in London is to be believed. Contrary to popular images of the office (think Ally McBeal), non-attractive people do sometimes enter the world of work. And, for their efforts, these un-beautiful people are rewarded with lower salaries. An ugly man will earn just \u00a317,000 a year compared with his more facially sorted colleague, who'll rake in \u00a320,000. But - and who'd have thought it - it's women, and particularly women in more junior roles, who suffer the most from not meeting attractiveness targets. Females in clerical and secretarial positions who are short and fat will earn around 15% less than prettier, skinnier administrators (and no, pretty, skinny administrators don't draft letters or file documents in a more attractive way). The study was based on a sample of 11,000 people aged 33; the age by which, WPM can only assume, the ugly ducklings have no chance of a late transformation to a swan.

A search team was immediately dispatched to the Goose Green crossroads south of Coolham in West Sussex, but no trace was found of the dress.

Police said yesterday that both items, which were covered in mud and well camouflaged, had been badly damaged, probably by a hedge cutter. It has been established that the hedge was trimmed on July 15, two weeks after Sarah disappeared and two days before her body was found. Detective superintendent Peter Kennett said: \"If they do turn out to belong to Sarah it is an extremely significant find.\" Police said it could be up to two weeks before scientists have completed tests which will show whether there are traces of DNA on the clothing that could lead to Sarah's killer.

      "body": "<p>It was a surreal moment. Past the gilded lions and pillars we walked, into the Law Society's imposing hall, hung with portraits of past luminaries. Its president, leader of the 80,000 solicitors in England and Wales, was closeted behind the doors of his ground floor office. The assembled reporters were there not to see him but to answer the summons of a former president waiting in an upstairs room.</p> <p>While the current commander shuffled his paperclips two floors below, his predecessor denounced him as \"unsuitable to lead the profession\". The once-august 175-year-old body was viewed by outsiders as a \"humourless farce\", said the ex-supremo, Rodger Pannone. It did not need Lady Thatcher's PR guru, Sir Tim Bell, called in to help mend its battered profile, to advise that its image was bad and had got worse.</p> <p>Martin Mears, cooling his heels downstairs, had announced his intention to run for a second term and Pannone was urging others to come forward and stand against him. Mears, he said, had had \"a whale of a time but I think the harm to the profession is very, very grave indeed\". The year was 1996. Four years later the farce is still playing.</p> <p>It started in 1995 when vice-president John Young was outed as a serial groper. Mears was elected that year by grass-roots solicitors to shake up what they saw as a bloated bureaucracy indifferent to their concerns. But his term sparked off an outbreak of bitter factionalism. There was a grassroots move to turf out the whole council, and in an open letter to the profession, council member Eileen Pembridge accused Mears and his vice-president Robert Sayer, of creating \"a climate of fear and distrust\".</p> <p>In 1997, when Mears ran again for president, a leaked memo from his opponents' camp revealed that they had discussed hiring private detectives to spy on him and his running mates. Meanwhile, a \u00a3454m hole was discovered in the Solicitors Indemnity Fund, caused by underestimat ing the severity of negligence claims against the profession. Solicitors had to cough up for that, for a \u00a37.1m overspend on a new computer and a \u00a33.4m overspend on refurbishing the Chancery Lane headquarters. Complaints against solicitors soared, building up a huge backlog. Mears and Sayer had an acrimonious falling-out, with Sayer describing his former ally as forever turning up \"like a piece of dog turd on your shoe\".</p> <p>Today, at a Watford employment tribunal, the curtain will rise on what the long-suffering profession must hope will be the final act. In a four-week hearing - unless the case is settled -Kamlesh Bahl, vice-president of the society until she was forced out last March, will accuse it of race and sex discrimination. Bahl, 44, had been expected to take over as the first Asian and first woman president in July, but resigned ignominiously in March after an inquiry found her guilty of bullying staff.</p> <p>Her claim for compensation fingers five people: Sayer, whose term ended in July; Jane Betts, then secretary-general (head of staff); Jean Johnson, then head of human resources; Anne Coles, legal and constitutional adviser; and in-house lawyer Anthony Brookes. Sayer is still a member of the society's council. Betts' job has gone and she has been replaced by a new chief executive. Johnson has left too.</p> <p>The scene is set for the protagonists, including Bahl, to tell their tales for the first time in public. The inquiry, headed by Lord Griffiths, a retired law lord, heard evidence behind closed doors. Only his report, which paints a highly unflattering picture of Bahl's people-management skills, was made public. Until the curtain goes up this morning, both sides are keeping their cases under close wraps. Bahl has been staying shtumm since she bared her soul a few months ago to radio shrink Anthony Clare, admitting she'd felt suicidal and sought therapy for the first time in the aftermath of the affair. Her GP husband, Nitin Lakhani, said: \"She's preserving her end of it for the tribunal.\"</p> <p>The Law Society is saying nothing, referring all media calls to a PR company, which is saying nothing on its behalf. Even the society's 75-strong council is being kept in the dark. Council member Anthony Bogan gripes: \"Because the Law Society has become such a leaky institution, information given to council members is very limited. At the last two council meetings we've been told they can't say anything even in closed session.\" He is concerned at the mounting costs of the Bahl saga, thought to have reached \u00a31m and expected to hit \u00a31.5m by the time the tribunal finishes. \"The people paying for it are hard-working legal aid solicitors.\"</p> <p>Within days of being forced out, Bahl threatened a claim for race and sex discrimination, producing an opinion in her favour signed by Cherie Booth QC. Booth has since dropped out of the case, pleading breast-feeding duties. Bahl will be represented at the tribunal by a leading discrimination QC, Robin Allen, and Peter Herbert, president of the Society of Black Lawyers, which is backing her case.</p> <p>Griffiths, who was assisted by two members of the employment appeal tribunal - one black and one female - upheld all the complaints of bullying and harassment against Bahl by five staff, most of them senior officials. He found she had been \"at times demeaning and humiliating and at other times offensively aggressive.\"</p> <p>An elected office-holder rather than a manager, she had usurped Betts's role as head of staff \"and introduced an atmosphere of fear and confusion in the line of command\". She subjected staff to verbal onslaughts \"which we believe she used as a management tool to dominate staff and to stamp her authority on the organisation.\" The inquiry heard that other staff members had complained, but would not lodge formal complaints because they were afraid of Bahl and worried that they might lose their jobs if she became president.</p> <p>Bahl argues that the Griffiths report fails to take enough account of the background against which she was working. The society, whose role in policing solicitors sits uneasily with its trade-union role, was riven by internal politics, mistrust and division. A survey had shown mass disillusionment among solicitors with their professional body.</p> <p>Management consultant Lord Stephenson had pronounced in 1998: \"The society does not work. Its very structure prevents effective decision-making, and when decisions are made there is no means of ensuring they are implemented.\" One decision had taken three years. He proposed a radical overhaul.</p> <p>Bahl, then deputy vice-president, was put in charge with a tight timetable. She points out that Sayer admitted at the society's conference last year: \"There is only one way to get a large organisation to improve and that is to shout very loudly. You can't be Mr Nice Guy all your life.\" She claims she would have changed her behaviour and avoided further complaints had concerns been drawn to her attention. Instead, she says, complaints were \"stockpiled\" and she first learned of some of them more than a year after the incidents concerned.</p> <p>Why did no one take her aside for a quiet word? Sayer told the inquiry that after one verbal attack by Bahl on head of policy Russell Wallman during a meeting, he was \"shocked and embarrassed\", but said nothing at the time. \"I cannot now recall why I remained silent but I think it was because I simply did not know how to deal with it,\" Sayer said.</p> <p>A few attempts were made but no one seems to have laid it on the line firmly enough to get the message across. Michael Mathews, president at the time, told Griffiths: \"I tried to have an informal chat to get her to see what was happening, but I just did not get through.\"</p> <p>Once the axe fell, it fell swiftly. Six days after the Griffiths report was delivered, the council voted to suspend Bahl. She claims she was told the decision would be postponed and lost the opportunity to address the meeting. The following week she resigned, pre-empting a special general meeting of the whole profession to decide whether to expel her.</p> <p>This week she and the Law Society are back in the headlines again. But a new regime has taken over in Chancery Lane, with a new chief executive determined to turn it into an efficient and effective body. It looks like the Law Society may become boring again - a denouement its members must fervently desire.</p>",

Mears, he said, had had \"a whale of a time but I think the harm to the profession is very, very grave indeed\". The year was 1996. Four years later the farce is still playing. It started in 1995 when vice-president John Young was outed as a serial groper. Mears was elected that year by grass-roots solicitors to shake up what they saw as a bloated bureaucracy indifferent to their concerns. But his term sparked off an outbreak of bitter factionalism. There was a grassroots move to turf out the whole council, and in an open letter to the profession, council member Eileen Pembridge accused Mears and his vice-president Robert Sayer, of creating \"a climate of fear and distrust\". In 1997, when Mears ran again for president, a leaked memo from his opponents' camp revealed that they had discussed hiring private detectives to spy on him and his running mates. Meanwhile, a \u00a3454m hole was discovered in the Solicitors Indemnity Fund, caused by underestimat ing the severity of negligence claims against the profession. Solicitors had to cough up for that, for a \u00a37.1m overspend on a new computer and a \u00a33.4m overspend on refurbishing the Chancery Lane headquarters. Complaints against solicitors soared, building up a huge backlog. Mears and Sayer had an acrimonious falling-out, with Sayer describing his former ally as forever turning up \"like a piece of dog turd on your shoe\". Today, at a Watford employment tribunal, the curtain will rise on what the long-suffering profession must hope will be the final act. In a four-week hearing - unless the case is settled -Kamlesh Bahl, vice-president of the society until she was forced out last March, will accuse it of race and sex discrimination. Bahl, 44, had been expected to take over as the first Asian and first woman president in July, but resigned ignominiously in March after an inquiry found her guilty of bullying staff. Her claim for compensation fingers five people: Sayer, whose term ended in July; Jane Betts, then secretary-general (head of staff); Jean Johnson, then head of human resources; Anne Coles, legal and constitutional adviser; and in-house lawyer Anthony Brookes. Sayer is still a member of the society's council. Betts' job has gone and she has been replaced by a new chief executive. Johnson has left too. The scene is set for the protagonists, including Bahl, to tell their tales for the first time in public. The inquiry, headed by Lord Griffiths, a retired law lord, heard evidence behind closed doors. Only his report, which paints a highly unflattering picture of Bahl's people-management skills, was made public. Until the curtain goes up this morning, both sides are keeping their cases under close wraps. Bahl has been staying shtumm since she bared her soul a few months ago to radio shrink Anthony Clare, admitting she'd felt suicidal and sought therapy for the first time in the aftermath of the affair. Her GP husband, Nitin Lakhani, said: \"She's preserving her end of it for the tribunal.\" The Law Society is saying nothing, referring all media calls to a PR company, which is saying nothing on its behalf. Even the society's 75-strong council is being kept in the dark. Council member Anthony Bogan gripes: \"Because the Law Society has become such a leaky institution, information given to council members is very limited. At the last two council meetings we've been told they can't say anything even in closed session.\" He is concerned at the mounting costs of the Bahl saga, thought to have reached \u00a31m and expected to hit \u00a31.5m by the time the tribunal finishes. \"The people paying for it are hard-working legal aid solicitors.\" Within days of being forced out, Bahl threatened a claim for race and sex discrimination, producing an opinion in her favour signed by Cherie Booth QC. Booth has since dropped out of the case, pleading breast-feeding duties. Bahl will be represented at the tribunal by a leading discrimination QC, Robin Allen, and Peter Herbert, president of the Society of Black Lawyers, which is backing her case. Griffiths, who was assisted by two members of the employment appeal tribunal - one black and one female - upheld all the complaints of bullying and harassment against Bahl by five staff, most of them senior officials. He found she had been \"at times demeaning and humiliating and at other times offensively aggressive.\" An elected office-holder rather than a manager, she had usurped Betts's role as head of staff \"and introduced an atmosphere of fear and confusion in the line of command\". She subjected staff to verbal onslaughts \"which we believe she used as a management tool to dominate staff and to stamp her authority on the organisation.\" The inquiry heard that other staff members had complained, but would not lodge formal complaints because they were afraid of Bahl and worried that they might lose their jobs if she became president. Bahl argues that the Griffiths report fails to take enough account of the background against which she was working. The society, whose role in policing solicitors sits uneasily with its trade-union role, was riven by internal politics, mistrust and division. A survey had shown mass disillusionment among solicitors with their professional body. Management consultant Lord Stephenson had pronounced in 1998: \"The society does not work. Its very structure prevents effective decision-making, and when decisions are made there is no means of ensuring they are implemented.\" One decision had taken three years. He proposed a radical overhaul. Bahl, then deputy vice-president, was put in charge with a tight timetable. She points out that Sayer admitted at the society's conference last year: \"There is only one way to get a large organisation to improve and that is to shout very loudly. You can't be Mr Nice Guy all your life.\" She claims she would have changed her behaviour and avoided further complaints had concerns been drawn to her attention. Instead, she says, complaints were \"stockpiled\" and she first learned of some of them more than a year after the incidents concerned. Why did no one take her aside for a quiet word? Sayer told the inquiry that after one verbal attack by Bahl on head of policy Russell Wallman during a meeting, he was \"shocked and embarrassed\", but said nothing at the time. \"I cannot now recall why I remained silent but I think it was because I simply did not know how to deal with it,\" Sayer said. A few attempts were made but no one seems to have laid it on the line firmly enough to get the message across. Michael Mathews, president at the time, told Griffiths: \"I tried to have an informal chat to get her to see what was happening, but I just did not get through.\" Once the axe fell, it fell swiftly. Six days after the Griffiths report was delivered, the council voted to suspend Bahl. She claims she was told the decision would be postponed and lost the opportunity to address the meeting. The following week she resigned, pre-empting a special general meeting of the whole profession to decide whether to expel her. This week she and the Law Society are back in the headlines again. But a new regime has taken over in Chancery Lane, with a new chief executive determined to turn it into an efficient and effective body. It looks like the Law Society may become boring again - a denouement its members must fervently desire.",

      "body": "<b> March 6 2000</b> <br> <p> In the grubby, smoke-filled basement of the Breydel building in Brussels, members of the European Union press corps gather at noon each day for their briefing. Each of the 20 commissioners has a spokesperson, and they skip up to the dais in turn. Today's subject is the imposition of a kerosene tax on every plane flying in Europe. I note details, but as I do so they seem to slip away. A film of dead language wraps everything - phrases such as \"parallel effort\" and \"global approach\". </p> <p>I find a book listing the legislative achievements of the EU for 1999. Opened at random, page 406 shows a directive governing second-hand car prices in the Ukraine. A British spokesman rounds on me to complain about the behaviour of London newspapers. Nothing, it seems, will induce them to print positive stories. I can't think of what to say to him. </p> <p><b> March 9</b><br> </p> <p> Back to the Breydel to visit Romano Prodi, commission president. The lift deposits me on the 12th floor rather than the fourth. I keep taking wrong turnings, and can retain my bearings only by means of a poster representing the triumph of the treaty of Maastricht, which I pass again and again. Prodi's suite of offices is surprisingly banal and he apologises for the ugliness. Prodi is smallish, dapper, soft-voiced. He was appointed with the task of making the EU commission believable after the mass resignation of commissioners that marked the end of Jacques Santer's tenure in 1999. In recent weeks Le Monde has attacked him for irresolution, alleging that he is an \"Anglo-Saxonist\". Under his tutelage, it is said, the prestige of the commission has fallen further still. </p> <p>Prodi suggests to me that Europe means so little to its citizens because they are essentially contented, and not fighting a war. Somehow Europeans must be led to realise that they are all members of minorities now, whether they are French, Italians or Bosnians. \"Europe is a union of minorities,\" he says. \"There is no majority in Europe.\" Prodi appeals to me as an anti-politician. He's the sort of professor I always wanted - someone with a developed sense of irony who enjoys speculative chat. In public, however, stumbling over boring speeches, he comes across as a modern-day Wizard of Oz. It is easy to see why the slick \u00e9narques - graduates of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration - don't rate him. </p> <p><b> March-April</b><br> </p> <p> Brussels days. Mistaking fire hydrant cupboards for conference rooms, I bumble Hulot-style around the parliament building. Outside, the ugliness of Brussels overcomes me. I cannot think of such a place as the capital of Europe. But I notice a kind of solace in the vast, mall-like spaces. Here MEPs are afforded all-weather shelter from the prospect of nonexistence. </p> <p>The buzz this month concerns the creation of a declaration of fundamental human rights for Europe. I walk into the plenary session to find great-and-gooders, summoned from every country, discussing what constitutes a fundamental right. Everyone wants to add to the list - one hyper-PC Frenchman wishes two mentions to be made of women's rights - except the Brit, who would prefer to see a distinction made between so-called \"ordinary\" rights and more important ones. Politely, because he is not a Eurosceptic, the Brit wants to make the point that rights are guaranteed in European democracies and that this airy superstructure of verbiage may not be necessary. A Finn appears momentarily to derail the proceedings by speaking of \"horizontal issues\". </p> <p>I take away from the meeting a poignant sense of the difficulties implied by translation. It is hard to force concepts into languages in which they have had no previous existence, and we end by either minimising differences or exaggerating them. Eurenglish, which has displaced French as the EU's everyday language, is not much help - it merely gives the illusion of comprehension. Later, the amiable Greek head of translation fills me in on the problems arising from the arrival of 10 more EU members. She suggests that there will have to be a double system of translation from, say, Hungarian or Latvian into English, and thence to Finnish, because the most obscure permutations are likely to prove prohibitively expensive. There is resistance to this scheme, because no one wants their language to join the second tier. </p> <p>Meanwhile, I am becoming uneasily aware of the depth of orthodoxy in Brussels. It is as if everyone repaired each day to some secret place where they were issued blue-and-yellow pills enabling them to believe in something called Europe. </p> <p>The most flamboyant federalist is the red-haired, sharp-suited Green, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who keeps a paving stone from 1968 on his desk. He lectures me on the need for a strong Europe to protect us from the ravages of international capitalism. When I ask him whether it will be possible to stay British or French and be a New European, he becomes angry. \"You British always want to have it both ways,\" he shouts. \"Keep your pound. Decide. Leave Europe.\" </p> <p>On another floor of the parliament building, a Brit is busy editing a Eurosceptic magazine entitled These Tides. His name is David Wilkinson and he is taking photographs of a young woman in a tight T-shirt inscribed with the word \"never\". Dressed in brogues and a very English suit, Wilkinson is charming and witty, but he reminds me of what is ultimately wrong with the Eurosceptics. Wilkinson believes that the EU is doomed to fall apart as a consequence of its contradictions, in much the same way that Marxists used to say that capitalism would end by destroying itself. He doesn't see that anything done in Brussels might be useful. In London, such views are rehearsed daily by a large part of the press, and it is even possible to think of them as being reasonable. Here we may see them for what they are - quixotic. </p> <p><b> April 9</b><br> </p> <p> More Brussels days. In one shop near the Grand Place, I acquire a bathroom towel in EU colours. The portly assistante assures me that it is not unusual to find couples buying entire sets \" pour se mettre en Europe \". Who can these compulsives be? </p> <p>I meet a man who may be the ultimate federalist. Thierry B\u00e9chet is Belgian, and he is chef de cabinet in the overseas aid directorate. For him the New Europe means escaping Europe's past. The European nation states did not ensure the survival of democracy; more often, they destroyed it. Composed of laws offering the prospect of citizenship regardless of one's ethnic origins, a federal Europe will indeed represent a higher stage of civilisation. Look at the Yugoslav war, B\u00e9chet says. There, people were slaughtered because of who they were: Croats, Bosnians or Serbs. In Europe, everyone will choose. Remembering how bored my 87-year-old French mother is with the prospect of enduring national differences, I experience a brief quasi-revivalist rush of internationalism. </p> <p><b> April 17, Poland</b><br> </p> <p> Joining the EU is proving more difficult for Poland than eliminating the last vestiges of socialism. I am told that there are at least 30,000 regulations that must be adopted before membership is possible. The legislative programme is stalled, and many Poles have begun to complain about what they must do. I am given a 15-kilo boxed set of the acquis communautaire - the EU in paper form - and I take this to Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister. Geremek is depressed by the lack of progress. For him, Poland is part of Europe anyhow - centuries of Polish struggles against enemies to the east demonstrate this. \"Europe for us is a community,\" he says. \"It shouldn't be about jealously guarding a rich man's club.\" </p> <p>But I begin to realise that things are not so simple in Poland. A deal is being done, though it bears little relation to the lofty talk about values in Brussels. On the Belarus border, the Polish guards have been equipped with Land Rovers paid for by the EU. At the checkpoint, cars with Belarussian plates are backed up for 2km. Soon these Belarussians are to lose their easy access to Polish markets. So the real border of Europe is already in place. </p> <p><b> May 9, back in Brussels</b><br> </p> <p> Long ago, in the 1970s, I suppose I considered myself an enthusiast, but I veered towards scepticism around the time in which it became apparent that the EU could not or would not do anything about the war in the Balkans. Now I find myself somewhere between rage and resignation. I know that the practice of contem porary democracy is meant to involve a certain degree of banality. But I had not realised that banality, like rain-washed concrete, can come in so many different shades of grey. </p> <p>A pattern is established by now in my relationship with Brussels. I walk off the Eurostar into a cloud of mild anomie. What is this place for? What am I doing here? I am beginning to understand that there is something called real life in Brussels - far from being faceless or corrupt, the bureaucrats are often nice, and usually harried, as I discover when the ladies of the town-twinning department burst into tears while describing how their missionary work is frustrated by lack of funds. \"They always want folk-dancing,\" the head of the department says. \"We would be happier if they had conferences about xenophobia, but they like folk-dancing.\" </p> <p><b> May 16, Strasbourg</b><br> </p> <p> I am off to the European parliament's other home. I take the train from Brussels, travelling for five hours through Belgium, Luxembourg and eastern France in the company of sleepy young wannabe Eurocrats. I find myself standing before an enormous, ellipse-shaped building with a courtyard in which a young woman is assembling a giant bumblebee. This proves to be a prop for the day's Greenpeace demonstration against genetically modified food. A first walk around the Louise Weiss building - no one seems to know who she was - makes it clear that pseudo-reality has been allowed to flower here into an extravagant bloom. MEPs, their aides and secretaries scurry in all directions. They hate being here and the grumbling is noisy and pervasive. </p> <p>My head becomes lighter and lighter as I try to struggle ontologically with the existence of this building. At the Edinburgh summit of 1992, the new parliament was given the green light at the same time as the British and Danish secured theirvarious opt-outs. So this elaborate, foolish building, costing as much as the Millennium Dome and used only four days a month, should be named not after Louise Weiss, but John Major. </p> <p><b> June 18, Feira, Portugal </b><br> </p> <p> More limousines, more journalists - this is an EU summit. We assemble in a hangar designed for trade fairs. I am told that participants are working on an agenda leading to another summit, culminating in a treaty. </p> <p>In Porto, I stand outside the 18th-century banqueting hall, taking Polaroids of EU leaders. Tony Blair looks terrible; the rest are merely numb with fatigue. Prodi is smiling, but this may be because we have by now learned to recognise each other. Later, I corner Prodi, who tells me that I shouldn't worry about the lack of progress because the timescale for Europe is so long. \"Ten years, 50 years!\" he exclaims, throwing up his hands in amusement. \"Why not?\" </p> <p><b> September 28, Copenhagen </b><br> </p> <p> It is stifling in Christiansborg, the Danish parliament building. Everyone who is anyone in the Danish political elite is crammed into two small, smoky rooms. I watch the exit polls fluctuate until the size of the no vote becomes clear. Then the mood changes rapidly. \"It's not quite a fuck-off-and-die vote,\" a friend tells me. The prime minister is ashen and bursts into tears during a rendition of a Danish version of The Red Flag. </p> <p>I ask the former commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard whether there is anything the EU could do to make itself more loved by Danes. \"I don't know,\" she says. \"I really don't.\" Befuddled by free Tuborg, I try to calculate how many countries, given the opportunity to vote this night, would have delivered a different result. Surely not Germany, where support for the currency is running at 25%, or France, where Chirac is sinking in the wake of a scandal involving a videotape and envelopes containing millions of francs from building contractors. Perhaps Belgium would have voted yes, and the Netherlands - perhaps, too, Luxembourg, Ireland, Finland . . . But a majority of Europeans? Surely not. </p> <p><b> October 6 </b><br> </p> <p> I am in the air, over the Alps, when I read Tony Blair's speech, just delivered at the Polish stock exchange and billed as his most important yet about Europe. Blair wants Europe to be \"a superpower, but not a superstate\". But this is the day after the fall of Milosevic, and the Middle East is blowing up. No one will be listening. </p> <p>At the self-proclaimed heart of Europe, I can see little but a busy void. The EU will neither break up nor become a receptacle for the dreams of Europeans. If it does reform itself, this will not be in a spectacular or even especially engaging fashion. Those who believe in grand visions, or think that the EU can suddenly mature into a supranational democracy, are deluding themselves. For the moment, it should be enough to think of Brussels as a place to which it is sometimes necessary to go, in order to bring things back.</p>",

Everyone wants to add to the list - one hyper-PC Frenchman wishes two mentions to be made of women's rights - except the Brit, who would prefer to see a distinction made between so-called \"ordinary\" rights and more important ones. Politely, because he is not a Eurosceptic, the Brit wants to make the point that rights are guaranteed in European democracies and that this airy superstructure of verbiage may not be necessary. A Finn appears momentarily to derail the proceedings by speaking of \"horizontal issues\". I take away from the meeting a poignant sense of the difficulties implied by translation. It is hard to force concepts into languages in which they have had no previous existence, and we end by either minimising differences or exaggerating them. Eurenglish, which has displaced French as the EU's everyday language, is not much help - it merely gives the illusion of comprehension. Later, the amiable Greek head of translation fills me in on the problems arising from the arrival of 10 more EU members. She suggests that there will have to be a double system of translation from, say, Hungarian or Latvian into English, and thence to Finnish, because the most obscure permutations are likely to prove prohibitively expensive. There is resistance to this scheme, because no one wants their language to join the second tier. Meanwhile, I am becoming uneasily aware of the depth of orthodoxy in Brussels. It is as if everyone repaired each day to some secret place where they were issued blue-and-yellow pills enabling them to believe in something called Europe. The most flamboyant federalist is the red-haired, sharp-suited Green, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who keeps a paving stone from 1968 on his desk. He lectures me on the need for a strong Europe to protect us from the ravages of international capitalism. When I ask him whether it will be possible to stay British or French and be a New European, he becomes angry. \"You British always want to have it both ways,\" he shouts. \"Keep your pound. Decide. Leave Europe.\" On another floor of the parliament building, a Brit is busy editing a Eurosceptic magazine entitled These Tides. His name is David Wilkinson and he is taking photographs of a young woman in a tight T-shirt inscribed with the word \"never\". Dressed in brogues and a very English suit, Wilkinson is charming and witty, but he reminds me of what is ultimately wrong with the Eurosceptics. Wilkinson believes that the EU is doomed to fall apart as a consequence of its contradictions, in much the same way that Marxists used to say that capitalism would end by destroying itself. He doesn't see that anything done in Brussels might be useful. In London, such views are rehearsed daily by a large part of the press, and it is even possible to think of them as being reasonable. Here we may see them for what they are - quixotic. April 9 More Brussels days. In one shop near the Grand Place, I acquire a bathroom towel in EU colours. The portly assistante assures me that it is not unusual to find couples buying entire sets \" pour se mettre en Europe \". Who can these compulsives be? I meet a man who may be the ultimate federalist. Thierry B\u00e9chet is Belgian, and he is chef de cabinet in the overseas aid directorate. For him the New Europe means escaping Europe's past. The European nation states did not ensure the survival of democracy; more often, they destroyed it. Composed of laws offering the prospect of citizenship regardless of one's ethnic origins, a federal Europe will indeed represent a higher stage of civilisation. Look at the Yugoslav war, B\u00e9chet says. There, people were slaughtered because of who they were: Croats, Bosnians or Serbs. In Europe, everyone will choose. Remembering how bored my 87-year-old French mother is with the prospect of enduring national differences, I experience a brief quasi-revivalist rush of internationalism. April 17, Poland Joining the EU is proving more difficult for Poland than eliminating the last vestiges of socialism. I am told that there are at least 30,000 regulations that must be adopted before membership is possible. The legislative programme is stalled, and many Poles have begun to complain about what they must do. I am given a 15-kilo boxed set of the acquis communautaire - the EU in paper form - and I take this to Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister. Geremek is depressed by the lack of progress. For him, Poland is part of Europe anyhow - centuries of Polish struggles against enemies to the east demonstrate this. \"Europe for us is a community,\" he says. \"It shouldn't be about jealously guarding a rich man's club.\" But I begin to realise that things are not so simple in Poland. A deal is being done, though it bears little relation to the lofty talk about values in Brussels. On the Belarus border, the Polish guards have been equipped with Land Rovers paid for by the EU. At the checkpoint, cars with Belarussian plates are backed up for 2km. Soon these Belarussians are to lose their easy access to Polish markets. So the real border of Europe is already in place. May 9, back in Brussels Long ago, in the 1970s, I suppose I considered myself an enthusiast, but I veered towards scepticism around the time in which it became apparent that the EU could not or would not do anything about the war in the Balkans. Now I find myself somewhere between rage and resignation. I know that the practice of contem porary democracy is meant to involve a certain degree of banality. But I had not realised that banality, like rain-washed concrete, can come in so many different shades of grey. A pattern is established by now in my relationship with Brussels. I walk off the Eurostar into a cloud of mild anomie. What is this place for? What am I doing here? I am beginning to understand that there is something called real life in Brussels - far from being faceless or corrupt, the bureaucrats are often nice, and usually harried, as I discover when the ladies of the town-twinning department burst into tears while describing how their missionary work is frustrated by lack of funds. \"They always want folk-dancing,\" the head of the department says. \"We would be happier if they had conferences about xenophobia, but they like folk-dancing.\" May 16, Strasbourg I am off to the European parliament's other home. I take the train from Brussels, travelling for five hours through Belgium, Luxembourg and eastern France in the company of sleepy young wannabe Eurocrats. I find myself standing before an enormous, ellipse-shaped building with a courtyard in which a young woman is assembling a giant bumblebee. This proves to be a prop for the day's Greenpeace demonstration against genetically modified food. A first walk around the Louise Weiss building - no one seems to know who she was - makes it clear that pseudo-reality has been allowed to flower here into an extravagant bloom. MEPs, their aides and secretaries scurry in all directions. They hate being here and the grumbling is noisy and pervasive. My head becomes lighter and lighter as I try to struggle ontologically with the existence of this building. At the Edinburgh summit of 1992, the new parliament was given the green light at the same time as the British and Danish secured theirvarious opt-outs. So this elaborate, foolish building, costing as much as the Millennium Dome and used only four days a month, should be named not after Louise Weiss, but John Major. June 18, Feira, Portugal More limousines, more journalists - this is an EU summit. We assemble in a hangar designed for trade fairs. I am told that participants are working on an agenda leading to another summit, culminating in a treaty. In Porto, I stand outside the 18th-century banqueting hall, taking Polaroids of EU leaders. Tony Blair looks terrible; the rest are merely numb with fatigue. Prodi is smiling, but this may be because we have by now learned to recognise each other. Later, I corner Prodi, who tells me that I shouldn't worry about the lack of progress because the timescale for Europe is so long. \"Ten years, 50 years!\" he exclaims, throwing up his hands in amusement. \"Why not?\" September 28, Copenhagen It is stifling in Christiansborg, the Danish parliament building. Everyone who is anyone in the Danish political elite is crammed into two small, smoky rooms. I watch the exit polls fluctuate until the size of the no vote becomes clear. Then the mood changes rapidly. \"It's not quite a fuck-off-and-die vote,\" a friend tells me. The prime minister is ashen and bursts into tears during a rendition of a Danish version of The Red Flag. I ask the former commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard whether there is anything the EU could do to make itself more loved by Danes. \"I don't know,\" she says. \"I really don't.\" Befuddled by free Tuborg, I try to calculate how many countries, given the opportunity to vote this night, would have delivered a different result. Surely not Germany, where support for the currency is running at 25%, or France, where Chirac is sinking in the wake of a scandal involving a videotape and envelopes containing millions of francs from building contractors. Perhaps Belgium would have voted yes, and the Netherlands - perhaps, too, Luxembourg, Ireland, Finland . . . But a majority of Europeans? Surely not. October 6 I am in the air, over the Alps, when I read Tony Blair's speech, just delivered at the Polish stock exchange and billed as his most important yet about Europe. Blair wants Europe to be \"a superpower, but not a superstate\". But this is the day after the fall of Milosevic, and the Middle East is blowing up. No one will be listening. At the self-proclaimed heart of Europe, I can see little but a busy void. The EU will neither break up nor become a receptacle for the dreams of Europeans. If it does reform itself, this will not be in a spectacular or even especially engaging fashion. Those who believe in grand visions, or think that the EU can suddenly mature into a supranational democracy, are deluding themselves. For the moment, it should be enough to think of Brussels as a place to which it is sometimes necessary to go, in order to bring things back.",

The finger of suspicion im mediately points to Benji the Binman, aka Benjamin Pell of north London, who has made a good living from the Sunday Times and other News International titles, and has seen the fruits of his labours appear in most national newspapers. Mr Pell, who has his own overalls and van, and has been known to leave replacement bin bags to stop householders becoming suspicious, is believed to have been behind a series of leaked Tony Blair-Philip Gould memos earlier this year. The notes hinted at what has been occupying Mr Powell. One read \"Arsenal Dome - what say CS?\" CS is believed to refer to Chris Smith, the culture secretary, though the notes did not reveal what he did say. Another said \"mini-reshuffle\" though yet again there were no details, nor were we enlightened as to why a large tick was through the name of Bill Gates. Alastair Campbell, the No 10 official spokesman whose name appeared on one of the sheets, was not amused. \"I have seen some dross on front pages in my time but they might have got a better story if they had produced the contents of one of his kid's nappies,\" he said.",

What upmarket excuses. Rosemary is still waiting. Also, her sensitive builder has disappeared, the one who felt money and possessions were unimportant. She last saw him outside her bank, where she handed him a huge wad of cash. Builder made jokes about drug dealers and promised to come back and finish the shelving. Rosemary is still waiting.</p> <p>I know how she feels. Our builder also lost interest towards the end of the job. We have dangling wires and we don't have plugs yet, nor the missing cupboard door nor the bit of skirting nor the tile edging. To be fair, Builder offered to return after the summer holidays, but by then Gardener had taken over.</p> <p>I notice that builders often start dynamically, then wilt and long to be off on other jobs, where the whole ghastly cycle begins again: the burst of enthusiasm, the slowing down, lack of interest, short disappearances, long disappearances. Are they gone forever? No one knows.</p> <p>But at least these builders are polite. Years ago I complained to the gutter mender. He had mended the gutter, which then poured water the next day. \"Could you please come back and mend it?\" I asked. \"Fuck off,\" said the gutter man.</p> <p>Then there was the decorator who nearly throttled me. I banned woodchip, he slapped it on while I was out, I came back and insisted he take it down, so he grabbed me by the throat. His little joke. Now I always try to find builders recommended by friends. Then they leave the friend's job to come and look, make a start, go back and finish the friend's job, or perhaps fix up the next job, make a start there, come back to me, possibly . . . Now where's Gardener gone?</p>",

      "bodyText": "What a strange lot builders are. Rosemary's tiler has failed to turn up twice. Once because he was stuck at \"a meeting in the city\", once because he'd spent a weekend in Las Vegas, his flight had been delayed, he needed to sleep off the jet lag, then he'd be round. What upmarket excuses. Rosemary is still waiting. Also, her sensitive builder has disappeared, the one who felt money and possessions were unimportant. She last saw him outside her bank, where she handed him a huge wad of cash. Builder made jokes about drug dealers and promised to come back and finish the shelving. Rosemary is still waiting. I know how she feels. Our builder also lost interest towards the end of the job. We have dangling wires and we don't have plugs yet, nor the missing cupboard door nor the bit of skirting nor the tile edging. To be fair, Builder offered to return after the summer holidays, but by then Gardener had taken over. I notice that builders often start dynamically, then wilt and long to be off on other jobs, where the whole ghastly cycle begins again: the burst of enthusiasm, the slowing down, lack of interest, short disappearances, long disappearances. Are they gone forever? No one knows. But at least these builders are polite. Years ago I complained to the gutter mender. He had mended the gutter, which then poured water the next day. \"Could you please come back and mend it?\" I asked. \"Fuck off,\" said the gutter man. Then there was the decorator who nearly throttled me. I banned woodchip, he slapped it on while I was out, I came back and insisted he take it down, so he grabbed me by the throat. His little joke. Now I always try to find builders recommended by friends. Then they leave the friend's job to come and look, make a start, go back and finish the friend's job, or perhaps fix up the next job, make a start there, come back to me, possibly . . . Now where's Gardener gone?",

In last week's trial the 54-year-old accused had allegedly raped his stepdaughter and indecently assaulted his daughter. There was no link between the two cases, and Newsnight didn't refer to any cases other than the one they featured.

The trial was aborted and TVS fined for contempt of court. That was very different from the Liverpool example. In Reading the man on trial had been implicated in the activities exposed by the programme. The Liverpool judge must have believed that jurors seeing a programme about one abusive stepfather might have thought: \"If that stepfather on TV did those wicked things, it makes it more likely that the stepfather in the dock is also guilty.\" That's surely going too far and, what's more, an insult to the jury.</p> <p>There's another aspect.

      "body": "<p>Is beauty an advantage? Does it make the beautiful individual powerful? Does it, as researchers at London Guildhall University revealed last week, result in substantially better pay and opportunities in the workplace? \"Looks are always talked about as if they're power, when what it is of course is that power has to be about action, and beauty rests on other people's reactions,\" said domestic goddess Nigella Lawson in a recent interview. \"One has no control over other people's reactions, therefore it seems to me to be wrong to talk about power.\"</p> <p>Lawson has become a talking point of late. But it's not the likeness of the cheese crust to the one pictured on page 116 that forms the topic of conversation. It's Nigella's eyes, her hair, her body, her sticky licky fingers. She is beautiful. Men love her. Some women are beginning to loathe her. Advantage or disadvantage, beauty still provokes an unruly range of emotions, from pure lust to sheer envy.</p> <p>It is 10 years since feminist author Naomi Wolf pronounced on the beauty myth. \"Beauty is a currency system like the gold standard,\" she wrote. \"Like any economy, it is determined by politics and in the modern age in the west it is the last, best belief system that keeps male dominance intact.\"</p> <p>Wolf decried society's obsession with female beauty and challenged us to place more value on intelligence, complexity, empathy and humour. But your sneaking suspicion that Nigella's face counts for more than her talent with a hand whisk would suggest that in the past decade we haven't taken up Wolf's challenge. Television, newspapers and magazines are as beauty-obsessed as ever. Across the board, the visual diversity of women's looks is under-represented. How often do you see grey-haired women presenters? How often are they bigger than a size 12? How often have they got a big nose?</p> <p>The media may not be entirely to blame. True, the constant bombardment of images of flawless models creates unrealistic expectations of women, but according to an evolutionary psychological analysis, we are only behaving as we always have. David Buss, of the University of Texas, believes women's desire for beauty stems from men's mate preference. The results of his and other studies into this area have led Buss to believe that, over evolutionary history, men have imposed their desire for attractiveness on women because physical attractiveness provides a set of proximate clues to health and youth, and therefore fertility.</p> <p>In the book Sex, Power, Conflict, Buss states: \"A woman enhances her own beauty at the expense of other women because she improves her own odds of attracting a desirable man at a cost to her competitors.\"</p> <p>How we actually judge what is beautiful, though, is the subject of other important scientific research. We know that babies respond more to \"pretty\" than not so pretty faces. But further studies have revealed that the more regular and symmetrical the features, the more likely we are at any age to judge a face to be beautiful. Model good looks, then, are all about averageness equalling attractiveness.</p> <p>But do those model good looks bring other advantages? My model agent friend Helena is equivocal. \"People outside of the modelling industry think that somehow the very fact of being a model will bring you instant self-esteem. We generally pluck these girls from relative obscurity - the school or community where they are quite clearly the prettiest. We pop them on a headsheet next to 59 other beautiful girls and sometimes the competition becomes too much. Even some of our most well-known, successful girls are paranoid about their weight, their spots, their cellulite. The real joke is that while the general public are busy trying to look like the girls in the ads, the girls in the ads are busy trying to look like another girl in another ad. I could tell you stories of really famous girls who can barely get through the day because their self- esteem is so low. Being beautiful actually makes them miserable.\"</p> <p>My own modelling career was similarly demoralising and thankfully shortlived. Kindly (or not) overlooking a certain heaviness about the backside, a model agency put me on its books when I was 18. Overnight, I turned from an attractive (if a little pudgy) teenager into a too-fat failure of a model. I slogged around London with my portfolio of three pictures and suffered the humiliation of being not beautiful enough, not slim enough, not good enough. I don't think anyone was sorry when I gave up, but the rejection still chills my bones.</p> <p>It's doubtless the same feeling Cindy Crawford will be suffering, now she's been dropped from her Revlon cosmetics contract. It was alleged that her image was considered \"too boring\" to shift products, though it was hard to ignore the implication that - at 34 - she was also too old. It has since been rumoured that Est\u00e9e Lauder may now consider dropping 35-year-old Liz Hurley as their main model, having already hired the younger Uma Thurman to assist their fight for a bigger market share.</p> <p>But surely that's just the crazy world of cosmetics. I spoke to my friend who works in publishing, very lovely Rosemary. Without the bizarre aesthetics of the fashion industry to deal with, perhaps she would have found her beauty an advantage?</p> <p>\"The men around here are easy,\" she tells me. \"If I want to get my own way, I pretty much know what will make them respond positively.\"</p> <p>Should we approve of such tactics? \"I'm not doing anyone any harm,\" Rosemary insists. \"If they're daft enough to fall for it, they deserve it. I don't consider myself to be any great shakes but there are women in this building who took a dislike to me on sight. No matter how nice I am to them, how many times we go out for a drink after work, they always take a swipe at my looks. My immediate boss, who's not as attractive as me, brings me into meetings with male colleagues with the words: 'Ah, Rosemary - there you are, looking beautiful as ever.' She may as well hold a placard over my head, saying: 'Pretty? Yes, but don't ask her anything.' Women don't like beautiful women, particularly not as their subordinates. It upsets the natural balance when men are around. It's a predatory thing.\"</p> <p>Nancy Etcoff would agree. In her book Survival of the Prettiest, she stated that beauty is no asset to an ambitious woman. \"There is an assumption that beautiful women are too flaky, too sexual and unable to lead the troops, and they often fail to reach the top. For women wanting to climb the corporate ladder, there is evidence that they must conceal their beauty in order to get ahead.\"</p> <p>Nor does working with men make a difference. \"Beauty? An advantage?\" laughs my friend Rebecca, who works in an almost exclusively male environment. \"I'm not sure how much longer I can deal with this schoolboy 'phwoar' mentality. I try to have sensible conversations with colleagues and find myself having to ignore their silly innuendo. They think it's flattering, but it's not. It's degrading.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, scientists maintain that feminism will never achieve any great success in eliminating our obsession with female beauty. While Buss believes Wolf may have altered our values to a small degree, those changes will only cause women to compete with each other in a different way. \"If all men were suddenly persuaded to value physical strength in a mate,\" he has said, \"and to be indifferent to other dimensions of physical attractiveness, then women would, over time, compete with one another to build muscles.\"</p> <p>The fashion industry, by its very existence, perpetuates an idealised image. But, perhaps surprisingly, it is also the best place to learn the true value of beauty. As a journalist, you are never part of the beauty currency because there is always someone younger, slimmer, more beautiful than you. As you stand by and watch another 19-year-old having her 15 minutes, you realise that although we are seduced by it, beauty has a very limited value in the real world. Of course it can be an advantage, but unless you're model material, it won't make you money.</p> <p>In the real world, beauty is a marketing tool that can occasionally open doors and occasionally slam them in your face. And on TV it can turn a very dull subject into a ratings success. How much more interesting did gardening become when Charlie Dimmock began pushing the wheelbarrow about? Good for her. As Simone de Beauvoir said: \"To make oneself an object, to make oneself passive, is a very different thing from being a passive object.\"</p> <p>So if, by any chance, there's a boring TV genre left after cooking, gardening or home improvement that needs a bit of sex interest, I'd like to offer myself up to it. The Carpet Bowls show? Ready, Steady, Knit? Or maybe we could do a programme that extolled the virtues of housework. We could call it How to be a Domestic Slave and I'd get to wear a French maid's outfit. If nothing else, it may mean a few more men would discover where the Hoover is kept.</p>",

Israeli troops and Hizbullah fighters exchanged fire after yesterday's explosion in the area known as Har Dov, near the place that Hizbullah calls Shebaa farms, which Israel captured in the 1967 war. Lebanon and Syria say that the area, which lies at the foot of the Golan Heights, was taken from the Lebanese; Israel insists that it was captured from Syria. The UN backs the Israeli interpretation.

      "bodyText": "Victims of all serious crime will be given the right to know when their attackers are being released from jail, under plans announced yesterday by the government aimed at neutralising Tory claims that it has been soft on crime. Probation officers are expected to administer the scheme and were last week told that victims would also be entitled to know conditions of release, such as where offenders might stay. Last night this sparked fears of possible vigilante action, with the Tories and probation officers urging Jack Straw, the home secretary, to ensure the plans do not become a green light for retaliation. Mr Straw chose to make the announcement in a Sunday tabloid and wrote: \"In the new year I will be announcing proposals so that the victims of all prisoners serving a sentence of 12 months or more are notified of their release date. \"And that will not be just for violent crime but for burglaries and thefts too. That will give victims better protection and also ensure their peace of mind.\" A bill going through parliament gives victims of sex offences the right to know when their attackers will be released. Probation officers have been told that the widening of victims' rights will be in place by April 2001, in time for the general election. Mr Straw's plans follow the former Beatle George Harrison's demand to know the release date of Michael Abram, who attacked him with a knife at his home. Explaining his thinking behind the move, Mr Straw wrote in the People: \"When I read and hear of the experiences of those like George and Olivia Harrison it intensifies my determination. \"Victims are understandably concerned that even if their attackers have been sent to prison, there is no way of knowing when they will be released. \"Few things could be more distressing than suddenly facing your attacker at the local shop or pub when you thought they were behind bars. \"And I intend to end the horror of a rape victim suddenly coming face to face with her attacker in the street because she did not know he had been freed.\" Last year 28,700 people serving sentences of 12 months or more were released from jail. Harry Fletcher, of the National Association of Probation Officers, said: \"If the offender has to live at a hostel, and that information is given to the victim, that could lead to retaliation. We'll be looking to clarify that with the Home Office. \"We accept that times are changing. The probation service in the past was solely about the rehabilitation of offenders and didn't take victims into account. \"It's important to understand how the victims feel as part of the rehabilitation process.\" It is expected that most victims will be informed by letter, though probation officers may visit those who have suffered more serious crimes. The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, said: \"We will not oppose any sensible measures brought forward by the government which are to the genuine benefit of victims of crimes. \"It is quite clear that victims should not be expected to live with the threat that they will wake up one morning with their perpetrator living next door. \"At the same time any such proposal should not be a licence for a vigilante society.\"",

      "body": "<p>Rayner Unwin, who has died aged 74, was born into the publishing business, being a son of Sir Stanley Unwin, whose dedication to the trade was total. He also witnessed the collapse of a style of publishing which, notably in the 1980s, became no longer able to survive.</p> <p>After education at Abbotsholme school, Uttoxeter, and leaving it aged 17 with, as he later wrote, \"no conspicuous qualifications\", Rayner sold books for Basil Blackwell of Oxford. As this was wartime, and paper rationing was severe, the customers were often asked to cut back their optimistic orders, thus providing curious training for a future publisher. After military service in the Royal Navy, which mainly entailed rounding up Japanese after the conflict was over, he went to Trinity College, Oxford, and Harvard. In 1951, as had been presumed all along, he joined the family firm of George Allen &amp; Unwin, at 40 Museum Street, Bloomsbury.</p> <p>It cannot have been easy working there, on \u00a334 a week. His father read all the mail, both incoming and outgoing. The place was Dickensian, its ledgers and orders written by hand. Employees complained of bed bugs, left over from the building's wartime use as a public air raid shelter. The offices, never elegant, became yet more labyrinthine after numbers 40A and 41 were purchased.</p> <p>As recreation for the 50 staff, there was deck quoits on the roof, and darts in the basement, with darts often preferred, as it was tedious retrieving a quoit after it had fallen five storeys to the street. There were spy-holes for Stanley to see what was going on, and visitors could be come lost, perhaps straying into the packing department, where labels were glued on to secondhand cardboard boxes which were tied up with string.</p> <p>But the place lived within its means, never being overexcited about a major profit. It had good authors, including Lancelot Hogben, Bertrand Russell, Julian Huxley and then, most amazingly of all, Thor Heyerdahl, after Stanley's nephew, Philip Unwin, stumbled upon the Kon-Tiki story while visiting Scandinavia. JRR Tolkien was acquired shortly afterwards, Rayner, having cabled his father (then selling books abroad) that The Lord Of The Rings was worthy of publication but might lose \u00a31,000. Back came the famous reply: \"If you believe it is a work of genius, then you may lose a thousand pounds.\"</p> <p>Despite the infusions of cash which the various best- sellers produced, there was never much sign of affluence. Allen &amp; Unwin's fame partly occurred for its astonishing turnaround in book dispatch, almost all orders being dealt with on the day of their arrival, but their authors' contracts could create merriment (as I knew personally) and also envy if shown to other publishers.</p> <p>I f advances were modest, as indeed they were, the writers at least knew their books would stay in print if possible, and never be remaindered when sales stayed small or microscopic. There were some 2,500 titles extant on its lists when Rayner took over as chairman after his father's death in 1968.</p> <p>That profligacy, plus a wide-ranging interest, was largely to blame for Allen &amp; Unwin's later troubles. It seemed to have covered every kind of book - academic, popular, railway engines (Philip's fancy), exploration, philosophy (often from India) and fiction. The name of Allen had been retained from the firm's earlier history, which meant that, in records of titles, the company seemed to be top on every form of list.</p> <p>As in the old days, the business was editorially led, but a consultant was introduced in the 1960s who then, after joining the board, became managing director. He pushed through reforms which, as Rayner himself wrote, \"would have been entirely sensible in the competitive climate of a public company\". Some could hardly be called objectionable, such as a two-thirds pension from the age of 60 or formal contracts of service, but power politics was getting in the way of editorial choice. The new broom was not content with a gentle upward drift of profitability, but wanted to spend more - and therefore to make more. This was anathema for the old school, among whom Rayner counted himself.</p> <p>Allen &amp; Unwin's major problem, acute in the mid-1980s, was being middle-sized, neither large enough to absorb overheads easily nor small enough to be quirky and buoyant. The company showed its first loss in 1985, and the decision was taken to join Bell &amp; Hyman, thus forming Unwin Hyman, with A&amp;U having a 40% stake in the new company and with Rayner as chairman. Five years later that firm was bought by HarperCollins, and Rayner performed the melancholy task of collecting by van a few personal relics.</p> <p>The new owners retained in print no more than a few highlights, such as the Tolkien books, and only employed half a dozen members of the Unwin Hyman staff. The asset-stripping operation, as Rayner wrote (in a privately published book called A Remembrance) was \"messy, depressing, and, at times, outrageous for those at the receiving end\".</p> <p>Rayner Unwin, who was awarded the CBE in 1977, was a senior figure with the Publishers Association, notably for the 23rd International Publishers Association Congress of 1987, the first to be held in the UK since 1936, when his father had been in charge. He published five books of his own, including The Defeat Of John Hawkins and A Winter Away From Home, the latter about the extraordinary over-wintering in the arctic by William Barents in the 16th century.</p> <p>In 1952, he married Carol Curwen, a childhood friend and daughter of Harold Curwen, owner of Curwen Press. They had three daughters and a son, Merlin, who now looks after Merlin Unwin Books.</p> <p>\u0095 Rayner Stephens Unwin, publisher, born December 23 1925; died November 23 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rayner Unwin, who has died aged 74, was born into the publishing business, being a son of Sir Stanley Unwin, whose dedication to the trade was total. He also witnessed the collapse of a style of publishing which, notably in the 1980s, became no longer able to survive. After education at Abbotsholme school, Uttoxeter, and leaving it aged 17 with, as he later wrote, \"no conspicuous qualifications\", Rayner sold books for Basil Blackwell of Oxford. As this was wartime, and paper rationing was severe, the customers were often asked to cut back their optimistic orders, thus providing curious training for a future publisher. After military service in the Royal Navy, which mainly entailed rounding up Japanese after the conflict was over, he went to Trinity College, Oxford, and Harvard. In 1951, as had been presumed all along, he joined the family firm of George Allen &amp; Unwin, at 40 Museum Street, Bloomsbury. It cannot have been easy working there, on \u00a334 a week. His father read all the mail, both incoming and outgoing. The place was Dickensian, its ledgers and orders written by hand. Employees complained of bed bugs, left over from the building's wartime use as a public air raid shelter. The offices, never elegant, became yet more labyrinthine after numbers 40A and 41 were purchased. As recreation for the 50 staff, there was deck quoits on the roof, and darts in the basement, with darts often preferred, as it was tedious retrieving a quoit after it had fallen five storeys to the street. There were spy-holes for Stanley to see what was going on, and visitors could be come lost, perhaps straying into the packing department, where labels were glued on to secondhand cardboard boxes which were tied up with string. But the place lived within its means, never being overexcited about a major profit. It had good authors, including Lancelot Hogben, Bertrand Russell, Julian Huxley and then, most amazingly of all, Thor Heyerdahl, after Stanley's nephew, Philip Unwin, stumbled upon the Kon-Tiki story while visiting Scandinavia. JRR Tolkien was acquired shortly afterwards, Rayner, having cabled his father (then selling books abroad) that The Lord Of The Rings was worthy of publication but might lose \u00a31,000. Back came the famous reply: \"If you believe it is a work of genius, then you may lose a thousand pounds.\" Despite the infusions of cash which the various best- sellers produced, there was never much sign of affluence. Allen &amp; Unwin's fame partly occurred for its astonishing turnaround in book dispatch, almost all orders being dealt with on the day of their arrival, but their authors' contracts could create merriment (as I knew personally) and also envy if shown to other publishers. I f advances were modest, as indeed they were, the writers at least knew their books would stay in print if possible, and never be remaindered when sales stayed small or microscopic. There were some 2,500 titles extant on its lists when Rayner took over as chairman after his father's death in 1968. That profligacy, plus a wide-ranging interest, was largely to blame for Allen &amp; Unwin's later troubles. It seemed to have covered every kind of book - academic, popular, railway engines (Philip's fancy), exploration, philosophy (often from India) and fiction. The name of Allen had been retained from the firm's earlier history, which meant that, in records of titles, the company seemed to be top on every form of list. As in the old days, the business was editorially led, but a consultant was introduced in the 1960s who then, after joining the board, became managing director. He pushed through reforms which, as Rayner himself wrote, \"would have been entirely sensible in the competitive climate of a public company\". Some could hardly be called objectionable, such as a two-thirds pension from the age of 60 or formal contracts of service, but power politics was getting in the way of editorial choice. The new broom was not content with a gentle upward drift of profitability, but wanted to spend more - and therefore to make more. This was anathema for the old school, among whom Rayner counted himself. Allen &amp; Unwin's major problem, acute in the mid-1980s, was being middle-sized, neither large enough to absorb overheads easily nor small enough to be quirky and buoyant. The company showed its first loss in 1985, and the decision was taken to join Bell &amp; Hyman, thus forming Unwin Hyman, with A&amp;U having a 40% stake in the new company and with Rayner as chairman. Five years later that firm was bought by HarperCollins, and Rayner performed the melancholy task of collecting by van a few personal relics. The new owners retained in print no more than a few highlights, such as the Tolkien books, and only employed half a dozen members of the Unwin Hyman staff. The asset-stripping operation, as Rayner wrote (in a privately published book called A Remembrance) was \"messy, depressing, and, at times, outrageous for those at the receiving end\". Rayner Unwin, who was awarded the CBE in 1977, was a senior figure with the Publishers Association, notably for the 23rd International Publishers Association Congress of 1987, the first to be held in the UK since 1936, when his father had been in charge. He published five books of his own, including The Defeat Of John Hawkins and A Winter Away From Home, the latter about the extraordinary over-wintering in the arctic by William Barents in the 16th century. In 1952, he married Carol Curwen, a childhood friend and daughter of Harold Curwen, owner of Curwen Press. They had three daughters and a son, Merlin, who now looks after Merlin Unwin Books. \u0095 Rayner Stephens Unwin, publisher, born December 23 1925; died November 23 2000",

Increasing taxes or cutting government spending will also curb growth but it is a less popular means of controlling the speed of the economy. What is the effect of raising rates?

Their inquiry will he an unprecedented test of the probity and accountability of the African National Congress government in Pretoria. Signed at the end of last year, the deal has prompted numerous allegations of corruption and conflict of interest on the part of senior ANC politicians and civil servants. BAe has denied impropriety, saying it had \"meticulously abided by the rules\". \"It was one of the most rigorous negotiating processes we have encountered\". The parliamentary public accounts committee opened the four-pronged inquiry into how the contracts were awarded after the auditor general found serious flaws in the procurement process. Committee members were alarmed to discover that the cost rose by nearly 50% in a year. Last week the committee convened a meeting with the auditor general, the office for serious economic offences, the public protector of government ethics, and a special investigations unit headed by Judge Willem Heath. There was a \"need to prove or disprove once and for all the allegations which cause damage to perceptions of government\", a spokesman said. Accusations of irregularities were first made by an unidentified group of \"concerned ANC MPs\" unhappy that some sub-contracts had been awarded to companies associated with senior government figures, past and present. The auditor general singled out the way in which a contract for 52 Hawk and Gripen fighter planes went to the Anglo-Swedish consortium of BAe Systems and Saab. The Hawks were ranked second of the four contenders in the overall evaluation but the armaments acquisition council decided not to take cost into account and gave the contract to BAe. The public accounts committee voiced concern that the Hawks and Gripens were being sold at double the basic price, \"apparently for necessary extra features\".The committee said an inquiry was needed to see if \"improper influence\" decided whichfirms got the contract, and \"the possible role played by influential parties in determining the choice of sub-contractors\". The allegations have been raised in parliament by a Pan-Africanist Congress MP, Patricia de Lille, who called for an inquiry into the actions of the head of defence acquisitions, Chippy Shaik. Critics of the deal, including the South African churches, have argued that the money would be better spent on alleviating poverty, and that South Africa faced no military threat justifying such a large expenditure.

      "bodyText": "The government was braced for a \"beef war\" with France last night after Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, made clear he was ready to ban imports as the number of BSE cases uncovered across the channel continued to grow. He promised to act swiftly if an investigation by the food standards agency this week decides that French beef poses a risk to public health after last week stepping up spot checks at ports. Aware that a ban could be later ruled unlawful, Mr Brown said: \"If Sir John Krebs [FSA chairman] says new measures are needed, then we will do that now and then argue it in the EU afterwards. \"What everyone else is doing is to take action and then justify it later.\" He appeared to suggest that any action might in part be in retaliation for the French ban on British beef despite the European commission's decision to allow exports to resume. Little French beef is imported into Britain and a ban could have more diplomatic than health implications, increasing pressure on Paris to end a boycott of UK beef. The shadow agriculture minister, Tim Yeo, said: \"The doubts about the safety of French beef are now so serious it is the only responsible action the government can take.\" French farmers fear the discovery of BSE in their herds, after the number of cases detected trebled this year to more than 100, could be catastrophic for sales. Mr Brown hinted yesterday that the government is to spend \u00a319m helping British farmers meet higher bills due to stricter hygiene standards at abbatoirs licensed to process beef for export. The National Farmers' Union warned against a hasty ban on French beef. Ben Gill, NFU president, said: \"If a ban is justified, then that is what we must do. But it would be folly if we tried to interfere with the FSA in its infancy as it tries to establish itself. \"It is important that we listen to Sir John Krebs and do not overreact.

The state atomic energy group would use technology it acquired through buying reactor-building businesses to construct plants in place of its obsolete Magnox stations. British Airways and American Airlines are to relaunch their global partnership within weeks and could make fresh plans to merge their transatlantic operations. The companies intend to make a \"declaration of renewed commitment\" to each other and to their global Oneworld marketing alliance of airlines after months of uncertainty while BA was attempting to buy Dutch airline KLM. Drinks giant Allied Domecq has been spurned by rival Diageo over an approach to carve up Seagrams \u00a37bn spirits and wine empire.

Britain is set to stay out of the euro for at least five years, analysts believe, amid increasing signs of voter and business hostility. A Mori survey for Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, published this weekend, showed public opposition to British membership of the euro at its highest since Labour took office in May 1997. Sunday Telegraph Emap, the magazine publisher and local radio operator, is considering the sale of its business publishing arm for an estimated \u00a3750m. The move would eliminate debt and allow the company to emerge as a pure consumer media group. Media executives say the group has received several approaches for the business, known internally as Emap Communications. Kevin Hand, the chief executive, has told associates he would consider a reasonable offer for the business though he is not in active negotiations. CSS Stellar, the sports and entertainment management group which represented the striking England rugby squad last week is to be valued at \u00a330m and raise \u00a310m in a stock market flotation that will make it the country's first quoted sports and entertainment management company. Coral, Britain's third biggest bookmaker, is seeking a buyer after abandoning plans for a \u00a31bn stock market flotation last month. Sunday Business Nasdaq is to undergo a corporate restructuring to create a separate London subsidiary that could pave the way for the US-based share market to renew its plans to link with the London Stock Exchange. Marks &amp; Spencer is considering pulling out of continental Europe. The stores company has instructed estate agents Healey &amp; Baker to conduct a thorough review of its property holdings in France, Spain, Portugal and Germany.

      "body": "<p>The singer and broadcaster, Carole Rosen, who has died of cancer aged 66, was a mezzo-soprano of style and verve, whose love of music led her into print and radio journalism, and biography. She undoubtedly had the voice, poise and presence to become a top diva, but it conflicted with her desire for family life.</p> <p>The only child of a cultured Jewish family rooted in Russia and Romania, Carole inherited her voice from her paternal uncle, Sam Rosen, noted for his Caruso-style tenor but also for his dissolute lifestyle; he gained, and later lost, a scholarship at the Guildhall School of Music, and ended up in vaudeville.</p> <p>Her father, Abel Rosen, himself a pianist child prodigy, won a first in mathematics at Imperial College, London, and became an electrical engineer. The seeds of performance were in his daughter's nature, though he feared that she might emulate her uncle's louche lifestyle. She herself was more philosophical: Uncle Sam simply had a typical tenor's faults - overeating, laziness and womanising.</p> <p>Carole graduated in politics, philosophy and economics from Somerville College, Oxford, in the mid-1950s, and joined the BBC as a studio manager. She studied singing with Helen Isepp, Lucy Manette, Otakar Kraus, Dame Eva Turner and Erich Vietheer, and made her London debut at the St Pancras arts festival in 1962, appearing in two television operas the following year.</p> <p>A scholarship from the Austrian government was followed by an Arts Council grant to study at the Vienna Music Academy. In 1964, she was offered a contract to sing with the Flensburg City Opera in Germany, where she took part in two performances of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.</p> <p>By this time she had met her future husband, the journalist-barrister Peter Marsh, whom she married in 1965.

      "bodyText": "The singer and broadcaster, Carole Rosen, who has died of cancer aged 66, was a mezzo-soprano of style and verve, whose love of music led her into print and radio journalism, and biography. She undoubtedly had the voice, poise and presence to become a top diva, but it conflicted with her desire for family life. The only child of a cultured Jewish family rooted in Russia and Romania, Carole inherited her voice from her paternal uncle, Sam Rosen, noted for his Caruso-style tenor but also for his dissolute lifestyle; he gained, and later lost, a scholarship at the Guildhall School of Music, and ended up in vaudeville. Her father, Abel Rosen, himself a pianist child prodigy, won a first in mathematics at Imperial College, London, and became an electrical engineer. The seeds of performance were in his daughter's nature, though he feared that she might emulate her uncle's louche lifestyle. She herself was more philosophical: Uncle Sam simply had a typical tenor's faults - overeating, laziness and womanising. Carole graduated in politics, philosophy and economics from Somerville College, Oxford, in the mid-1950s, and joined the BBC as a studio manager. She studied singing with Helen Isepp, Lucy Manette, Otakar Kraus, Dame Eva Turner and Erich Vietheer, and made her London debut at the St Pancras arts festival in 1962, appearing in two television operas the following year. A scholarship from the Austrian government was followed by an Arts Council grant to study at the Vienna Music Academy. In 1964, she was offered a contract to sing with the Flensburg City Opera in Germany, where she took part in two performances of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. By this time she had met her future husband, the journalist-barrister Peter Marsh, whom she married in 1965. He was attracted less by the glamourous operatic world than by her sense of vulnerability, and her \"very rich, bawdy humour\". He admired her exuberance, seriousness and generosity of spirit. With the German contract already in her hand, Carole opted instead for domestic compromise, and returned to England to seek concert work. She sang with Janet Baker, with the Handel Opera Society and as guest artist at Sadler's Wells. She gave recitals and broadcast for the BBC and Austrian and Israeli radios. In the 1980s and 1990s, she made radio programmes on Byron's works, and documentary features.

An interest in political and Jewish activities led her to join the Labour party, and participate in the West London Synagogue's care-in-communities satellite groups to promote inter-communal fraternity.

In particular, it seems that slightly more than half the population feels that information about their genes is private, and that if others know it, then they know too much. The overwhelming majority of people - 90%, according to the sample recently questioned by the Human Genetics Commission - feel that one should only have one's genetic information included on a database if one has given consent. And, rather significantly, only one in three people believes that insurance companies should have the right to see the results of genetic tests already taken. These figures, of course, are the result of only one survey.

Dr Geof Rayner United Kingdom Public Health Association If the Americans can't negotiate a reduction in environmental pollution, then they must be forced to do so. From today, we are starting a one-family stand against all things American, to bring them to their knees. So, it's goodbye Barbie, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Starbucks . . . Jonathan and Emma Cross Bradford-on-Avon How ironic. They ran out of time and had to hand over to the next bookers of the hall: oil industry executives. Mark Walker London What a terrible indictment of humankind that we cannot agree how to stop ourselves destroying the planet we inhabit. Mike Worthington Newcastle upon Tyne mike@worthington1.supanet.com The opening of the gigantic shopping mall in Beijing, and the description of the vast Volkswagon showroom as \"a sign of the future\", was depressing (Chinese shoppers glimpse scenes from a mall, November 25). The prospect of 1.3bn Chinese joining western style consumerism and becoming a car-owning society indicates a massive increase in global warming.

Everything, in their perverted vision, is about Brussels and straight bananas. But it isn't. It is about the America we have and the America we shall soon have. It is about a world where, without recrimination, we must fend for ourselves. It is about what - in a European Union context or some different context - we have to do for our own security. And the writing is on the Wall. peter.preston@theguardian.com",

So I asked St Francis and, thank God, I got better.\"</p> <p>Three months later Mrs De Barros, 63, travelled to St Francis's church at Caninde, north-east Brazil, dressed in a brown cassock of the type worn by the 13th-century Italian saint and carrying a carved wooden head to symbolise her return to health.</p> <p>She deposited the head - together with two wooden legs from relatives whose ailments were also cured after they prayed to St Francis - on a pile of several thousand similar representations of parts of the human body.</p> <p>Every year more than 10,000 are left in Caninde by people of the rural north-east, a Catholic practice dating back to the Middle Ages.</p> <p>Most of them are heads and legs, but the pile also contains breasts, hands, torsos, hearts, kidneys, and even babies. The gifts are called \"ex-votos\", from the Latin ex voto suscepto, meaning \"for a wish fulfilled\".</p> <p>If St Francis answers someone's prayer for help, the supplicant will travel to Caninde with an ex-voto. Often the pilgrim will promise to wear a brown cassock and only take it off when he or she eventually arrives at the church.</p> <p>The offerings reflect regional medical and social problems and are often used by academics to formulate public health policies.</p> <p>\"The ex-votos provide you with statistics - naturally, cheaply and spontaneously. You don't need to do lots of surveys,\" said Adalberto Barreto, professor of social medicine and psychiatry at Ceara University in Fortaleza. \"All you need to do is look at this.\"</p> <p>Dr Barreto, who has catalogued 216,552 of them in a period of 11 years, says the pilgrims come from an area the size of France in the nine drought-prone north-eastern states. \"The ex-votos reflect the social reality of the north-easterner. In each ex-voto there is a story of a victory, of a problem being overcome,\" he said.</p> <p>\"For example, when we noticed a reduction of polio legs, it showed that the anti-polio campaigns are getting better.</p> <p>The most striking con clusion was derived from the increase in heads, from less than 10% in the mid 1980s to about 25% in the 1990s.</p> <p>Dr Barreto attributes this to a rise in stress linked to the government's failure to respond to social needs.</p> <p>\"We researched 1,500 pilgrims who donated heads: 65% were women. The symptoms were headaches, insomnia and family worries.

      "bodyText": "Earlier this year Maria Teresa de Barros was taken ill and spent several days in hospital. \"I couldn't see. I didn't know where I was. I thought I might even die. So I asked St Francis and, thank God, I got better.\" Three months later Mrs De Barros, 63, travelled to St Francis's church at Caninde, north-east Brazil, dressed in a brown cassock of the type worn by the 13th-century Italian saint and carrying a carved wooden head to symbolise her return to health. She deposited the head - together with two wooden legs from relatives whose ailments were also cured after they prayed to St Francis - on a pile of several thousand similar representations of parts of the human body. Every year more than 10,000 are left in Caninde by people of the rural north-east, a Catholic practice dating back to the Middle Ages. Most of them are heads and legs, but the pile also contains breasts, hands, torsos, hearts, kidneys, and even babies. The gifts are called \"ex-votos\", from the Latin ex voto suscepto, meaning \"for a wish fulfilled\". If St Francis answers someone's prayer for help, the supplicant will travel to Caninde with an ex-voto. Often the pilgrim will promise to wear a brown cassock and only take it off when he or she eventually arrives at the church. The offerings reflect regional medical and social problems and are often used by academics to formulate public health policies. \"The ex-votos provide you with statistics - naturally, cheaply and spontaneously. You don't need to do lots of surveys,\" said Adalberto Barreto, professor of social medicine and psychiatry at Ceara University in Fortaleza. \"All you need to do is look at this.\" Dr Barreto, who has catalogued 216,552 of them in a period of 11 years, says the pilgrims come from an area the size of France in the nine drought-prone north-eastern states. \"The ex-votos reflect the social reality of the north-easterner. In each ex-voto there is a story of a victory, of a problem being overcome,\" he said. \"For example, when we noticed a reduction of polio legs, it showed that the anti-polio campaigns are getting better. The most striking con clusion was derived from the increase in heads, from less than 10% in the mid 1980s to about 25% in the 1990s. Dr Barreto attributes this to a rise in stress linked to the government's failure to respond to social needs. \"We researched 1,500 pilgrims who donated heads: 65% were women. The symptoms were headaches, insomnia and family worries. Our conclusion was that the excess of heads reflected the 'headache' of the state. \"People come to Caninde to ask for what they should be getting from social institutions.\" Even though there are trained doctors available, many north-easterners prefer to put their trust in St Francis. Maria de Nazare, 59, was at Caninde with a model head with a black circle on one cheek. The growth on her face was removed by surgery but she still wore a brown cassock, because she attributed her recovery to the saint. \"I asked him to help me so I would be well again.\" Dr Barreto, who gained a French doctorate for his work on ex-votos, has adapted other aspects of popular rural culture to social projects in Ceara. In one he organised medical courses for folk healers so that they could administer their cures without stigma and fear of arrest for charlatanism. He has also persuaded guitar-playing troubadours to feature problems such as parasitic infections and scabies in their songs. Most of the ex-votos are chiselled in wood by the pilgrims themselves, although local artists are sometimes commissioned. People from more-developed communities bring offerings made of plaster of Paris or polystyrene.",

Loukianetz avoids the victimised waif approach, suggesting sexual knowledge as well as physical frailty in the opening scenes. She is a woman aware that time is running out , avid for a depth of emotion that will free her from the arid \"vortices of sensuality\" (as the libretto puts it). In the brief moments before the opera's catastrophic turning point, she radiates contentment. At the end, she portrays Violetta's protracted demise with an excruciating literalness that avoids sentimentality. Vocally, she is impressive, if uneven. There are moments of harshness at full throttle, and the act one finale was marred by an unsteady lunge at an interpolated top E flat. On the plus side, we get coloratura of pin-prick accuracy, and a flawless, limpid smoothness in the great scene when she yields to Germont's moral pressure and gives Alfredo up. </p> <p>Thomas Allen and Giuseppe Sabbatini tellingly play the father and son who destroy and create her emotional world. Sabbatini's Alfredo is no innocent idealist, but a refined sensualist who is knocked off balance by his own feelings, and whose rebelliousness and incipient violence are shown as being the product of his father's rigidity. Allen suggests both the repression and the brutality beneath Germont's bourgeois veneer. When Violetta begs him to embrace her as his daughter, he avoids her in embarrassed revulsion. His first reaction on seeing his errant son is to raise his hand against him, while Sabbatini cowers in terror. Both men are completely compelling, even though Germont lies a bit low for Allen in places. Sabbbatini, however, is in glorious voice, with every note and phrase perfectly shaded. </p> <p>In the pit, things are regrettably less than ideal. Conductor Simone Young favours extreme speeds - dawdling in places and at other times taking the score at such a lick that the ensemble comes close to flying apart. </p> <p>\u0095 In repertory until December 18.

Resolutely unsentimental, tender, and horribly funny all at the same time, it will move the most hardbitten viewer to tears. There is no better way to spend seven minutes 50 seconds online this week.

Certainly one of the first of a flotilla of home-spun Star Wars movies. Set two days before the start of Episode IV: A New Hope (ie the original 1977 Star Wars), Jedi Mara Jade must escape the clutches of the evil empire. Others along for the ride include old friends Boba Fett and Jabba the Hut.

Resolutely unsentimental, tender, and horribly funny all at the same time, it will move the most hardbitten viewer to tears. There is no better way to spend seven minutes 50 seconds online this week. Get out your handkerchiefs. (KS) \u0095 View the film (7mins 50) The Dark Redemption (theforce.net) Possibly the original imitation. Certainly one of the first of a flotilla of home-spun Star Wars movies. Set two days before the start of Episode IV: A New Hope (ie the original 1977 Star Wars), Jedi Mara Jade must escape the clutches of the evil empire. Others along for the ride include old friends Boba Fett and Jabba the Hut.

Perhaps he had learned too well the lesson that hip hop gigs are generally intensely tedious, because he erred on the side of sensory overload, not a moment going by without a guitar solo or a homily about living the righteous life.
