Peoplism, as Reed defines it, is an economic state where individuals (or some of them) own and carry round with them the most important factor of production: brainpower. </p> <p>Reed the man decided to do something about the changing order when he found he was wondering what was going on not just once a month but twice a day. </p> <p>Change was leaving all short and long-term attempts to tweak or re-engineer the company's business looking frayed and inadequate. New competitors were arriving as if from outer space. The importance of physical assets was eclipsed, and returns to a few brain-rich yet capital poor individuals were enormous. </p> <p>'The only way we can survive is by being a truly creative business,' concludes Reed. Capital isn't creative - look at all those bricks-and-mortar companies that can't find anything to do with it except give it away or buy back their shares. It's people - or some people - who are creative. 'These are the ones we want, and we have to adapt to the consequences.' </p> <p>Those consequences aren't necessarily comfortable. Peoplism, says Reed, is 'fast, footloose and fancy free'. Fast: two young co-workers told him a rival agency was planning to launch a dot.com enterprise in a couple of months' time. So the pair put up a Reed website in a week - and the firm's share price shot up 30 per cent in one day. </p> <p>Footloose: Reed set up a niche agency before Christmas for placing well paid executives in specialised jobs. It was doing well and won several important contracts. But after Christmas, four partners in the start-up failed to reappear. End of business. </p> <p>Fancy-free: one of Reed's most creative graduates decided to take time off to explore South America. He may or may not return. Another has signed up for a course of singing lessons in Moscow - ditto. </p> <p>To tease out the implications of emerging peoplism, Reed has set up a new think tank, the Academy of Enterprise, with work contracted out to Demos, the Smith Institute and the Employment Policy Institute. </p> <p>Some of the issues they will look at are technical - how can managers and investors keep score when traditional accountancy disintegrates around them, for example. </p> <p>Reed ticks off the points: 'Budgeting is meaningless. It's too restricting: things just don't happen annually. Apart from the cash element, you can't rely on balance sheets, because fixed assets are unimportant, and stock can become worthless overnight. And profit and loss is too crude to measure service businesses, which are spending heaps on R&amp;D, but out of revenues, not capital.' </p> <p>Trying to tell this story to investors is one reason for the dot.com valuation anarchy. </p> <p>Other issues are profoundly socio-economic. A peoplist age, Reed admits, is unlikely to be kinder than a capitalist one; it will just be unkind in a different way. </p> <p>From a national point of view the UK lacks brains at the top and jobs at the bottom. 'New Deal' type initiatives (in which Reed is involved) will be needed at one end. Encouraging a brain injection at the other may be the only way not to lose out to 'e-lance' projects such as web development in Minsk or dealing with complaints letters in New Delhi. Meanwhile, the tax system will have to be adjusted to allow for the volatility of postmodern wealth: e-millionaire one day, e-pauper the next. </p> <p>Reed is not waiting for the think tank to report before taking action on his own account. Internally the company no longer manages by budget but by business plan, switching between scenarios as necessary. It has given up interviewing bright young graduates for jobs ('after 40 years we know interviewing is hopeless') in favour of the reverse: having looked at paper qualifications, it invites candidates to interview the company and then decide. </p> <p>Once recruited, individuals decide pay increases for themselves - within limits. Reed's business plan commits to making some people (those who aspire to it) very rich - a few millionaires a year. </p> <p>'We really do try to treat people differently,' says Reed. Individuals are 'co-workers' - 'they're not employees, that's plain wrong' - and in its behaviour towards them Reed aims to benchmark itself not against another employer but against, somewhat startlingly, the ideal Mum. So anyone who needs a loan for whatever purpose can have up to \u00a31,000 at any time, for however long, interest-free. (Reed has a lot of loans outstanding.) And it pays for 100 per cent of all vocational and 50 per cent of non-vocational training that any co-worker wants. </p> <p>'Fast learners will be fast earners,' says Reed. One challenge - which the Academy aims to address - is equipping individuals with the enterprise necessary for them to thrive in the peoplist economy. Another is to develop social as well as economic entrepreneurship, so that peoplism doesn't just become rampant individualism. </p> <p>'I'm optimistic, yes,' says Reed. Let's hope that's well-founded. </p> <p><a href=\"simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk\">simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>After the deluge, the damage analysis. It is clear that the tumultuous events of 10 days ago, when the world's major stock markets fell off a cliff, have hastened the collapse of many Internet companies' sky-high valuations. Whereas the Internet sector had hitherto seemed invincible against standard valuation models, the markets' recent slide show just how fragile such businesses are when reality bites. </p> <p>True, as last week progressed, all the main market indices, including that of Nasdaq, the US exchange for high-tech stocks, bungee-jumped enthusiastically. On Tuesday, Nasdaq soared by 7.2 per cent, its biggest one-day jump. </p> <p>Coupled with a modest rise the previous day it meant the Nasdaq had more than clawed back Friday's loss after just two days of trading. The bears, those who have been predicting that 10 years of stock-market upswing was about to come to an end, were ignored as market euphoria returned. </p> <p>But the shrewder analysts argue the Lazarus-style resurrection of tech stocks over the past week masks the wider issue. Perhaps because the Internet sector is often described as a bubble, we have been waiting for it to burst. But in reality the bubble has been shrinking since March. </p> <p>As highly respected Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget pointed out in a briefing note last week: 'The pullback in technology stocks has been brutal on the Internet sector: the stronger stocks are down 40 to 50 per cent from their highs, the weaker ones by 80 to 95 per cent.' </p> <p>A glance at some of the best known Internet companies confirms this assessment. Bookseller Amazon is currently worth around $18 billion, half of what it was worth last May. Music retailer CDnow is worth $100 million. A few months ago it was worth 20 times this. </p> <p>Overall, Nasdaq is still nearly 20 per cent off its peak. Freeserve, the UK Internet service provider, is now valued at just over half the \u00a38 bn it was worth in February. </p> <p>These slumps pale when compared with what has happened to some of the smaller Internet investment companies. Oxygen Holdings, which aims to invest in campus start-ups, has seen its share price fall from 60p to 12p in a couple of months, and is now valued at less than \u00a350m. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jellyworks.com/\" target=\"_new\">Jellyworks</a>, the investment vehicle headed by 24-year-old City whizzkid Jonathan Rowland, was worth 120p a share at the start of the year. Now its share price stands at 34p, and the company has seen its market capitalisation plunge from nearly \u00a3280m to \u00a377m. </p> <p>The fallout doesn't stop there. The big telecoms companies such as Colt, and <a href=\"http://www.cwcom.co.uk/main.html\" target=\"_new\">Cable &amp; Wireless</a>, whose values soared as the City started to view them as Internet stocks, have also seen their share prices slide. Likewise those firms which make the equipment which allows the Internet to function (Baltimore Technologies) or who were seen as key content providers (BSkyB and Reuters) have also taken a hammering. </p> <p>As the economists Varian and Shapiro famously observed: 'Technology changes. Economic laws do not.' </p> <p>If the Internet emperor has not been shown to be naked, he is at least now in an embarrassing state of d\u00e9shabill\u00e9 . </p> <p>Over the past few months, the Internet sector appears to have entered a more mature growth phase. And, as the sector continues to mature, further corrections look likely. Despite the slide since March, valuations of Internet stocks continue to be far higher than those of older companies which dare to make profits. </p> <p>Jeremy Batstone, head of research at NatWest Stockbrokers, believes the events of 10 days ago are likely to be repeated: 'We can expect to see more of the same. I've been encouraged by the way the markets recovered their poise, but I wonder if they are behaving irrationally by rising so strongly.' </p> <p>Even Blodget's favoured Internet stocks are still valued at between 25 and 100 times their estimated earnings for 2002, suggesting there is still some pretty hefty downside to come if Nasdaq takes another tumble. It is likely that this will happen sooner rather than later. </p> <p>Global investment strategists at HSBC argue that a 'further correction in US asset prices is likely in the next two quarters, particularly in the Nasdaq _ the risks associated with US equities appear to be rising as valuations remain stretched'. </p> <p>And, of course, as the valuations of many Internet companies become increasingly shaky, and investors and financial backers turn shy, a credit crunch looms. </p> <p>'More and more companies are going to face a cash crisis,' said Victor Basta, managing director of the investment bank, Broadview, which focuses on the technology sector. 'Look at some of the up-and-coming companies, many of which are loss-making: they've raised one or two years' worth of cash by going public at a very early stage. Basically they've used public money as venture capital. But the markets' turbulence means raising more money will be increasingly difficult for some.' </p> <p>Last Thursday alone, 11 of the 16 Internet companies that were scheduled to float on Nasdaq pulled their Initial Public Offerings - purely because of the downturn in market sentiment. </p> <p>Given this slide in enthusiasm, the natural inclination for many of the smaller Internet companies, especially those focused on the business-to-consumer (B2C) market - whose business plans are based more on hope and marketing than on substance - will be to merge or die. </p> <p>'I'm quite confident that 75 per cent of B2C companies won't be in their present form within two years,' said David Pannell, senior consultant at Durlacher, the high-tech investment bank. 'There will be a lot of consolidation. There are five garden centre sites at the moment, for example. Soon there will be no more than two, which will align themselves with the biggest mainstream garden centres.' </p> <p>Those who fail to find partners face a gloomy future. 'We believe the spoils will go to the few, not the many,' Blodget said. </p> <p>This consolidation in the market will in part be driven by the larger Internet companies looking to scoop up the smaller firms. 'It will precipitate deals between mid-sized players as they get approached by the larger players,' Basta said. 'Many will evaluate the strengths of a merger rather than an outright sale.' </p> <p>Concerns about the smaller players' long-term futures should also boost the established players. 'In any turbulent market, said Basta, 'you have people flooding to safe companies whose valuations will get bigger. There will be more opportunities for the big Internet companies to become consolidators.' </p> <p>As the value of many tech shares jag south, cash becomes king, a move which strengthens the positions of established companies with proven earnings streams. 'A number of bricks-and-mortar companies will move in to buy e-commerce companies,' Pannell said. </p> <p>Recently, for example, Dutch supermarket giant Ahold bought online retail chain Peapod for \u00a373m. Marks &amp; Spencer has also started making acquisitions in online firms. Last September it launched a venture fund which has subsequently taken stakes in upmarket lingerie firm Splendour.com and Talkcast, the digital information provider. </p> <p>Continued slides in the value of technology stocks will prompt further predatory action from the offline sector, which has started to come back into vogue. The valuation schisms between the old- and new-economy businesses are narrowing. </p> <p>Internet mania is fast becoming an anachronism. </p> <p> <strong>Safety and sanity? What the experts think...</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Mary Meekler of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, speaking two weeks ago, argued that the market was overheated.

      "bodyText": "After the deluge, the damage analysis. It is clear that the tumultuous events of 10 days ago, when the world's major stock markets fell off a cliff, have hastened the collapse of many Internet companies' sky-high valuations. Whereas the Internet sector had hitherto seemed invincible against standard valuation models, the markets' recent slide show just how fragile such businesses are when reality bites. True, as last week progressed, all the main market indices, including that of Nasdaq, the US exchange for high-tech stocks, bungee-jumped enthusiastically. On Tuesday, Nasdaq soared by 7.2 per cent, its biggest one-day jump. Coupled with a modest rise the previous day it meant the Nasdaq had more than clawed back Friday's loss after just two days of trading. The bears, those who have been predicting that 10 years of stock-market upswing was about to come to an end, were ignored as market euphoria returned. But the shrewder analysts argue the Lazarus-style resurrection of tech stocks over the past week masks the wider issue. Perhaps because the Internet sector is often described as a bubble, we have been waiting for it to burst. But in reality the bubble has been shrinking since March. As highly respected Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget pointed out in a briefing note last week: 'The pullback in technology stocks has been brutal on the Internet sector: the stronger stocks are down 40 to 50 per cent from their highs, the weaker ones by 80 to 95 per cent.' A glance at some of the best known Internet companies confirms this assessment. Bookseller Amazon is currently worth around $18 billion, half of what it was worth last May. Music retailer CDnow is worth $100 million. A few months ago it was worth 20 times this. Overall, Nasdaq is still nearly 20 per cent off its peak. Freeserve, the UK Internet service provider, is now valued at just over half the \u00a38 bn it was worth in February. These slumps pale when compared with what has happened to some of the smaller Internet investment companies. Oxygen Holdings, which aims to invest in campus start-ups, has seen its share price fall from 60p to 12p in a couple of months, and is now valued at less than \u00a350m. Jellyworks, the investment vehicle headed by 24-year-old City whizzkid Jonathan Rowland, was worth 120p a share at the start of the year. Now its share price stands at 34p, and the company has seen its market capitalisation plunge from nearly \u00a3280m to \u00a377m. The fallout doesn't stop there. The big telecoms companies such as Colt, and Cable &amp; Wireless, whose values soared as the City started to view them as Internet stocks, have also seen their share prices slide. Likewise those firms which make the equipment which allows the Internet to function (Baltimore Technologies) or who were seen as key content providers (BSkyB and Reuters) have also taken a hammering. As the economists Varian and Shapiro famously observed: 'Technology changes. Economic laws do not.' If the Internet emperor has not been shown to be naked, he is at least now in an embarrassing state of d\u00e9shabill\u00e9 . Over the past few months, the Internet sector appears to have entered a more mature growth phase. And, as the sector continues to mature, further corrections look likely. Despite the slide since March, valuations of Internet stocks continue to be far higher than those of older companies which dare to make profits. Jeremy Batstone, head of research at NatWest Stockbrokers, believes the events of 10 days ago are likely to be repeated: 'We can expect to see more of the same. I've been encouraged by the way the markets recovered their poise, but I wonder if they are behaving irrationally by rising so strongly.' Even Blodget's favoured Internet stocks are still valued at between 25 and 100 times their estimated earnings for 2002, suggesting there is still some pretty hefty downside to come if Nasdaq takes another tumble. It is likely that this will happen sooner rather than later. Global investment strategists at HSBC argue that a 'further correction in US asset prices is likely in the next two quarters, particularly in the Nasdaq _ the risks associated with US equities appear to be rising as valuations remain stretched'. And, of course, as the valuations of many Internet companies become increasingly shaky, and investors and financial backers turn shy, a credit crunch looms. 'More and more companies are going to face a cash crisis,' said Victor Basta, managing director of the investment bank, Broadview, which focuses on the technology sector. 'Look at some of the up-and-coming companies, many of which are loss-making: they've raised one or two years' worth of cash by going public at a very early stage. Basically they've used public money as venture capital. But the markets' turbulence means raising more money will be increasingly difficult for some.' Last Thursday alone, 11 of the 16 Internet companies that were scheduled to float on Nasdaq pulled their Initial Public Offerings - purely because of the downturn in market sentiment. Given this slide in enthusiasm, the natural inclination for many of the smaller Internet companies, especially those focused on the business-to-consumer (B2C) market - whose business plans are based more on hope and marketing than on substance - will be to merge or die. 'I'm quite confident that 75 per cent of B2C companies won't be in their present form within two years,' said David Pannell, senior consultant at Durlacher, the high-tech investment bank. 'There will be a lot of consolidation. There are five garden centre sites at the moment, for example. Soon there will be no more than two, which will align themselves with the biggest mainstream garden centres.' Those who fail to find partners face a gloomy future. 'We believe the spoils will go to the few, not the many,' Blodget said. This consolidation in the market will in part be driven by the larger Internet companies looking to scoop up the smaller firms. 'It will precipitate deals between mid-sized players as they get approached by the larger players,' Basta said. 'Many will evaluate the strengths of a merger rather than an outright sale.' Concerns about the smaller players' long-term futures should also boost the established players. 'In any turbulent market, said Basta, 'you have people flooding to safe companies whose valuations will get bigger. There will be more opportunities for the big Internet companies to become consolidators.' As the value of many tech shares jag south, cash becomes king, a move which strengthens the positions of established companies with proven earnings streams. 'A number of bricks-and-mortar companies will move in to buy e-commerce companies,' Pannell said. Recently, for example, Dutch supermarket giant Ahold bought online retail chain Peapod for \u00a373m. Marks &amp; Spencer has also started making acquisitions in online firms. Last September it launched a venture fund which has subsequently taken stakes in upmarket lingerie firm Splendour.com and Talkcast, the digital information provider. Continued slides in the value of technology stocks will prompt further predatory action from the offline sector, which has started to come back into vogue. The valuation schisms between the old- and new-economy businesses are narrowing. Internet mania is fast becoming an anachronism. Safety and sanity? What the experts think... \u0095 Mary Meekler of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, speaking two weeks ago, argued that the market was overheated. 'We believe that 10 per cent of the Internet stocks are undervalued; 90 per cent may be overvalued,' she said on American television. She believes that the recent market correction is helping focus investors' attention on the quality end of the sector, a move that will separate the leaders from the laggards. \u0095 Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs described the slump of 10 days ago as 'a market event rather than an economic event'. Cohen argued that investors were looking for signs that might provide comfort, and was confident that forthcoming corporate profits reports from some of the major US companies would reassure them. \u0095 Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch argues that the Internet sector is entering a mature growth phase which will cause further shake-outs and consolidation: 'Extreme volatility has been inescapable in the Internet sector for the past five years, and has worsened of late.

      "body": "<p>If you are worrying yourself sick about your shares, the chances are that you are a novice investor. People who invested in February and early March have lost most because they invested at the peak of the stock market. Someone who put \u00a31,000 into Framlington's NetNet fund then would now have only about \u00a3650. </p> <p>But financial advisers and stockbrokers say they got very few anguished phone calls after the sharp falls last week. Those they did receive tended to come from investors who were new to the market. 'Most of our clients can remember the 1987 crash,' says Colin Jackson of Baronworth. 'They are taking this as a slight blip - which is what it is. Our advice to them in 1987 was to sit tight. We would give the same advice now.' </p> <p>Ian Millward of Bath-based Chase de Vere is typical of advisers in telling his clients to resist the temptation to make rash decisions. </p> <p>Sitting tight was the best advice for most of those who could afford to do so in 1987. It took two years, on average, for unit trusts to recover their value after October 1987, according to the Association for Unit Trusts and Investment Funds. The current volatility - though quite likely to continue for a few months - is not in the same league as the nosedive of 1987. And volatile markets tend to go up just as quickly as they fall. The technology-dominated Nasdaq fell by 1,100 points the week before last, but rose by 500 points in just the first two days of last week. </p> <p>People who want to get their decisions right in future should consider the following points: </p> <p>\u0095 Start off in safer investments such as unit trusts if you are going to put money into the stock market. Your risk is spread in a fund between dozens or hundreds of different stocks. One reason that so many day traders will get their fingers burnt is that they are investing directly in individual company shares. This makes them far more vulnerable to the collapse of a single company than someone who invests in a unit trust, and may hardly notice the impact of a single firm going under. </p> <p>\u0095 View equity investments as long-term commitments, to be kept for at least five or 10 years.

      "bodyText": "If you are worrying yourself sick about your shares, the chances are that you are a novice investor. People who invested in February and early March have lost most because they invested at the peak of the stock market. Someone who put \u00a31,000 into Framlington's NetNet fund then would now have only about \u00a3650. But financial advisers and stockbrokers say they got very few anguished phone calls after the sharp falls last week. Those they did receive tended to come from investors who were new to the market. 'Most of our clients can remember the 1987 crash,' says Colin Jackson of Baronworth. 'They are taking this as a slight blip - which is what it is. Our advice to them in 1987 was to sit tight. We would give the same advice now.' Ian Millward of Bath-based Chase de Vere is typical of advisers in telling his clients to resist the temptation to make rash decisions. Sitting tight was the best advice for most of those who could afford to do so in 1987. It took two years, on average, for unit trusts to recover their value after October 1987, according to the Association for Unit Trusts and Investment Funds. The current volatility - though quite likely to continue for a few months - is not in the same league as the nosedive of 1987. And volatile markets tend to go up just as quickly as they fall. The technology-dominated Nasdaq fell by 1,100 points the week before last, but rose by 500 points in just the first two days of last week. People who want to get their decisions right in future should consider the following points: \u0095 Start off in safer investments such as unit trusts if you are going to put money into the stock market. Your risk is spread in a fund between dozens or hundreds of different stocks. One reason that so many day traders will get their fingers burnt is that they are investing directly in individual company shares. This makes them far more vulnerable to the collapse of a single company than someone who invests in a unit trust, and may hardly notice the impact of a single firm going under. \u0095 View equity investments as long-term commitments, to be kept for at least five or 10 years. This way you will expect fluctuations, and you will probably be able to get through a crash of the size of the one in 1987. Charles Levett-Scrivener of financial adviser Towry Law says: 'Investing in equities becomes gambling if you can't cope with the downside or can't wait for things to go right.' \u0095 Unless you are an experienced stock market investor with plenty of time to spend on following your shares, do not try to make your money on the stock market by the close timing of your investment decisions. Very few people make money this way. You will be better off sticking to funds run by professional managers. \u0095 Spread your risk. Millward says: 'The best way to protect your money is to go for a balanced portfolio, with some money in cash deposits, some in bonds and some in stocks and shares.' \u0095 Do not invest at all if you cannot bear the possible downside. If you would be ruined by a 25 per cent decline in the value of your portfolio, you should find a safer home for your money. The present volatility is regarded as a correction in excessive valuations of technology, and particularly Internet, companies, rather than a deterioration in their fundamentals. Experts think the uncertainty will continue because there is no consensus yet on how to value these firms.

      "body": "<p> <strong> The frequent share dealer</strong> </p> <p>Frequent dealers who obeyed the rules of investment should have set up cut-off points at which to take profits as the market moves up or down, and should by now be sitting on a tidy pile of cash. </p> <p>Such investors are in a good position to take advantage of the current market volatility, says Justin Urquart Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers. Frequent dealers have tended to concentrate on small, relatively unknown companies with low share prices, where it has been easier to make a quick profit. But Urquart Stewart says the price of shares in good-quality companies is now much lower than several months ago. </p> <p>'You are going to see a winnowing-out of wheat from the chaff. Frequent traders won't have to risk themselves in rinky-dink stocks, but can follow good-quality ones. Marconi is down from \u00a311 to \u00a37.50, Cable &amp; Wireless was selling for \u00a315.62 in March and is now down to \u00a310.13, and Lloyds TSB, which was selling for over \u00a310 last year is at \u00a36.61.' </p> <p>However, rather than simply plunging in, Urquart Stewart says investors should follow the companies they are interested in and wait until they have started climbing in value again to buy shares. </p> <p>Sadly, many of the new wave of frequent dealers have been so enthralled at making seemingly easy gains, they have failed to take profits or put stop losses in place to protect themselves. However, Jeremy Batstone, of NatWest Stockbrokers, says if such investors learn from this and set up suitable investment disciplines, they will be best placed to benefit from future stock market growth. </p> <p>Like many commentators, Batstone believes earnings growth is set to decrease, making it impossible to achieve 20 per cent a year by simply sitting back and doing nothing. To make decent returns, investors must learn to take smaller profits on a regular basis. </p> <p>He says: 'Investors must learn when to buy and sell, rather than buy and hold. It's not a good outlook for passive investors. People are going to have to become more proactive in their selling strategies.' </p> <p><strong> Investor with a lump sum</strong> </p> <p>If you've got several thousand pounds sitting in your bank account, what should you do? </p> <p>'Invest it,' says Jonathan Gumpel at London adviser Brooks Macdonald Gayer. 'People should not be afraid of buying into the market at the moment. Provided they are long-term investors, everything is cheap now. </p> <p>The market may have further to fall, but it may not. Old-economy stocks were already cheap, and there are super earnings figures coming from technology companies in the US. Stocks cost 40 per cent less now than they did two weeks ago.' </p> <p>However, Gumpel says investors should buy funds rather than individual stocks. He explains: 'It's not a case of buy old economy or new economy; it's a case of buying winners. It's very hard for individual investors to spot those, so I would buy funds to get blanket coverage.' </p> <p>He recommends the Perpetual Income &amp; Growth fund, an investment trust standing at a 20 per cent discount, for solid 'old economy' investment, plus the Aberdeen Technology unit trust or the Invesco English and International investment trust (at a 24 per cent discount) to give coverage of the so-called 'new economy'. </p> <p>Ian Millward of Bath independent adviser Chase de Vere Investments says investors should proceed as if the market were stable. 'Aim for a balanced portfolio, with some money in cash, some in fixed- rate bonds and some in stocks and shares, making use of your Isa allowance. Ideally you should have about 50 per cent invested in the UK market, and 50 per cent internationally, including 5 to 10 per cent in pure technology funds.' </p> <p><strong> Investor who put money into technology stocks and funds a year ago</strong> </p> <p>People who have had money invested in technology stocks over the past year are likely to be sitting on a tidy profit, despite the fall over the past two weeks. </p> <p>Investors in Framlington's NetNet fund, a unit trust that targets Internet companies and those making profitable use of the Internet, are still benefiting from a 50 per cent increase year on year, and have even seen their units increase in value last week. </p> <p>Lesley Hankin, marketing manager for Framlington, says: 'The NetNet fund went up by 5 per cent on Tuesday, for example, and we wouldn't be surprised if it has gone up by another 10 to 15 per cent by the beginning of next week. It's a very volatile market.' </p> <p>As a product provider, Framlington can't advise investors on how to handle their holdings, but Hankin says: 'We believe in the long-term story of the sector. We launched the fund on the basis that people should invest their money for long periods.' </p> <p>Gumpel of Brooks Macdonald Gayer agrees: 'They should sit tight. They're in profit and in the right long-term growth sector. They've just got to run with it.' </p> <p>However, Chase de Vere's Ian Millward says that it is quite reasonable for investors to take some of their profits out now, either to rebalance their portfolio or simply to spend. </p> <p>'We are firm believers in the technology sector, and there are still big returns to be had from it,' he says. 'It just depends on how comfortable you feel leaving your profits in place.' </p> <p><strong> Pensioner or soon-to-be pensioner</strong> </p> <p>If you are a pensioner dependent on the income from your equity or corporate bond fund, you will not be affected by any short-term falls in the market. 'You can just wait for the markets to calm down,' says Charles Levett-Scrivener of adviser Towry Law. </p> <p>If you are a pensioner with capital of less than \u00a340,000, equity investments are a bit of a risky home for your money, suggests Colin Jackson of adviser Baronworth. It is only if you have more than about \u00a350,000 that you could really be comfortable with some degree of risk through equities. </p> <p>If the current stock market nervousness makes you unable to sleep at night, you probably should not be invested there. 'No one should be relying on capital growth to fund life's necessities,' says Levett-Scrivener. </p> <p>If you are within 10 years of retirement, you should be starting a gradual process in your pension fund of divestment from equities into less risky fixed-interest funds or with-profits funds that are designed to smooth out stock market fluctuations. </p> <p>Adviser Chartwell suggests starting this process right now if you are 10 years away. 'Most people coming to retirement don't want added risk,' says spokesman Patrick Connolly. </p> <p>If you are in a final salary pension scheme, you do not have to worry about these issues - you are guaranteed a pension which is a certain proportion of your pay at retirement. But if you are in a personal pension or occupational 'money purchase' scheme, you are building up an investment fund - so investment issues are important to you. </p> <p>Most occupational 'money purchase' schemes will suggest to you that you divest in the decade before your planned retirement. </p> <p><strong> Middle Englander: forty-something with family, mortgage, pension and some investments</strong> </p> <p>'If you have got more than 10 years to go to retirement then the bulk of your investments should be in equities - unless you are really cautious,' says Charles Levett-Scrivener of Towry Law So the advice from most financial advisers to most clients in these circumstances will be to sit out the stock market fluctuations that we are likely to see continuing this summer. </p> <p>If you have invested sensibly, you will have a spread of investments through your pension fund, personal equity plans, individual savings accounts and, possibly, an endowment to back your mortgage. </p> <p>The trustees of your company pension scheme, for instance, will have anticipated exactly this sort of stock market nervousness when they devised their investment strategy. </p> <p>Your pension fund assets are likely to be spread between indexed funds, UK stocks, foreign shares, property and some fixed-interest vehicles. </p> <p>If you know that you will need some of the money - to help a child through university, for example - you should decide how much risk you can bear. </p> <p>If your total savings cover that expected cost and no more, you should probably play safe and put it on deposit if you need the money soon. </p> <p>If, however, you can tolerate a 10 per cent fall in the value of your investments and still pay these costs, you may not want to put that money on deposit yet. </p> <p>Similarly, if you have \u00a370,000 accumulated in Peps to pay off your \u00a380,000 mortgage in two years, you have a choice of cashing in the investments now (if you could not afford the possibility of a fall in value at the time you will need the money) or leaving the investments in place in the hope that they mature to reach \u00a380,000. </p> <p>If you have an endowment plan, you have to be particularly careful about early surrender (or selling it on the 'traded endowments' market) since many life offices will penalise you heavily for having cashed it in early. </p> <p><strong> Person who wants to invest each month</strong> </p> <p>Most advisers agree on this one. If you regard the money as a long-term investment (which should be more than 10 years) you should start a broadly-based unit trust or other savings plan now and not worry. Over any period of a few years, your investments will probably go down for a while. But over five to 10 years, equity investments will usually outperform cash, fixed-interest funds, property and other assets. </p> <p>'Go for growth funds - so the managers can go into technology when it looks good value,' says Patrick Connolly of Chartwell. Technology will undoubtedly be a factor in stock market growth over the foreseeable future - but with a broad unit or investment trust, managers can move in and out of technology stocks as they think fit. </p> <p>An obvious home for your money is an equities Isa - protecting you against capital gains tax and income tax - useful benefits for higher-rate taxpayers. The advantages of Isas are less marked for basic-rate taxpayers, but if you choose a low-charging provider you could find it a worthwhile investment in that the charges on the Isa are less than the tax you would have paid.</p>",

Watching the crisis from afar, the European commission president insists that he has no wish to be Italian prime minister again.</p> <p>In his first interview with a British newspaper since a recent flurry of criticism of his performance at the EU's helm - and dark, though unsubstantiated rumours of a plot to oust him - Mr Prodi, 60, says he is ready for a long haul in Brussels.</p> <p>\"I am not a sprinter. I am a marathon man,\" he declares combatively. \"This is a marathon. And a difficult one.\"</p> <p>Clearly bruised by speculation about his future, he reels off a neat list of his alleged gaffes and misjudgements to argue that he is doing fine running the EU's executive arm.</p> <p>Mr Prodi, who took over from the disgraced Jacques Santer of Luxembourg last autumn, is far more relaxed in private than in public, where he can come across as rambling and ineffective.</p> <p>\"Ah, I see you have not brought an interpreter,\" he jokes, a reference to suggestions that his English is poor.

      "bodyText": "Romano Prodi is taking a short Easter break at home in Bologna, but he is definitely not getting involved in the search for a new government in Rome. Watching the crisis from afar, the European commission president insists that he has no wish to be Italian prime minister again. In his first interview with a British newspaper since a recent flurry of criticism of his performance at the EU's helm - and dark, though unsubstantiated rumours of a plot to oust him - Mr Prodi, 60, says he is ready for a long haul in Brussels. \"I am not a sprinter. I am a marathon man,\" he declares combatively. \"This is a marathon. And a difficult one.\" Clearly bruised by speculation about his future, he reels off a neat list of his alleged gaffes and misjudgements to argue that he is doing fine running the EU's executive arm. Mr Prodi, who took over from the disgraced Jacques Santer of Luxembourg last autumn, is far more relaxed in private than in public, where he can come across as rambling and ineffective. \"Ah, I see you have not brought an interpreter,\" he jokes, a reference to suggestions that his English is poor. It is good enough - what may be more of a problem is that it is better than his French, which is no longer the automatic lingua franca in Brussels. Anxious aides look on as he negotiates the minefield he faces in any contact with the British public, this week rated in a Eurobarometer survey as the most hostile in the union to the EU and its works. Strikingly, not a word of criticism passes his lips about Tony Blair, not even the prime minister's reluctance to campaign positively on the burning issue of British membership of the single currency. Of course, argues Mr Prodi, never happier than when talking about the economics he used to teach, there are \"obvious\" consequences to not being a member of a large currency area - exchange rate fluctuations, disincentives to inward investment. But are there political consequences too? \"Probably yes, in the sense that there will be other forms of cooperation among the euro countries because they have the common currency. To be out is a choice.\" But it is strictly a choice for the British people. On defence too, he is anxious to avoid waving red rags at excitable Eurosceptic bulls. He never uses the phrase \"European army,\" he says, yet he is a strong supporter of EU-run peacekeeping to make the union a bigger global player. He exercises similar hyper-caution on Denmark, where a referendum in September on joining the single currency will be closely watched as a dry run for one after the election in Britain. On less controversial ground, Mr Prodi insists his top priority remains the enlargement of the 15-country EU to the east and south - another area where he has been criticised for suggesting delaying the entry of the first candidates. \"If we do not succeed with enlargement Europe will collapse,\" he warns. \"Strategically, we will be the biggest economic and political entity in the world - 500m people at the end of this process - twice the population of the US.\" But enlargement needs many changes if the EU's decision-making procedures, often encumbered by national vetoes, are to work in a union of up to 27 members. Mr Prodi raised eyebrows by putting forward his own proposals, on tax issues in particular, though reform is strictly a matter for governments. He is keen on the proposed EU charter of fundamental rights, to codify and simplify existing rights, but he agrees that national capitals, not Brussels, will have the last word on that too. Winding down before his holiday, Mr Prodi does not sound beleaguered. But he is being forced to defend himself against powerful, if anonymous, forces - in Berlin and Paris in particular, where there are those who see him as an Anglo-Saxon stooge. Closer to home, there is a sense that the commission is being overshadowed by the council - where EU governments come together to work on defence, justice and home affairs - and by a parliament which, though still weak, is more feisty than ever. Mr Prodi's response is that he is not being squeezed between the other two institutions but rather burdened with new tasks - not least in the Balkans, or following up the ambitious Lisbon summit agenda on e-commerce, computer literacy and education. \"I should like to be squeezed, but every day they ask us to do something new with the same budget and resources.\" He is particularly defensive about his contacts with the Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gadafy, arguing that he did a \"useful job\" in opening up a dialogue with a man other EU leaders were also \"queueing up\" to meet. Critics of that move, perhaps Mr Prodi's most controversial yet, say that the president of the commission has simply forgotten that he no longer has the freedom he enjoyed as prime minister. \"If you have responsibility for a developing institution, the only thing you cannot pretend is that you have clear-cut power,\" he says. \"I am prepared to be criticised many times, because when an institution is new it is fated to have problems of borders. \"It is a different type of power from the power I had in Italy, but it is so interesting because you have to create something new every day.

      "bodyText": "The shock wave from Zimbabwe's worst political crisis since independence is destroying the country's already fragile economy and spreading turbulence to markets throughout southern Africa, analysts warned this week. Inflation is running at more than 70% a year, half the workforce lacks jobs and fuel shortages have been endemic for months. Meanwhile, a foreign-exchange crisis is looming and the tobacco industry, which accounts for one fifth of the economy, is threatened by the conflict over white-owned farms. One analyst said on Wednesday that the country faced complete economic meltdown. \"The risk is that the political crisis will result in full-scale economic collapse,\" said Rian Le Roux, head of economic research at a leading investment house in South Africa. The white-owned farms at the centre of the unrest are the mainstay of the tobacco industry, which accounts for 40% of the country's export earnings and employs 65% of the workforce. Zimbabwe is the world's third largest exporter of tobacco and most of its 4,500 commercial farms are owned by whites, with the bulk involved in tobacco production. Analysts fear that with farmers abandoning their properties, planting for next year's harvest may be delayed or abandoned entirely. Those who have remained on their properties face hurdles selling this year's crop because the government has yet to devalue the Zimbabwe dollar, which is trading at 10% below its official value on the black market. The tourism industry, a key foreign exchange earner, is on its knees as reports of widespread lawlessness have brought an avalanche of cancellations. \"We are hurting badly, very badly,\" a local industry source said. Hotel occupancy at Victoria Falls, one of the world's top tourist destinations, was less than half the usual for this time of year, the start of the southern hemisphere autumn, industry sources said. Some fear that the Z$10bn (\u00a3166m) the country earned from its 2m visitors in 1999 could be halved this year. The decline of the labour-intensive tourism industry threatens to add to the existing mountain of jobless and will intensify Zimbabwe's looming foreign exchange crisis. Reserves are drying up and international donors are unwilling to arrest the country's fiscal deficit, which has also been in part caused by costly deployment of President Robert Mugabe's army in the civil war raging in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The concern felt by Zimbabwe's neighbours, whose markets have also been hit by the regional instability stemming from the former Rhodesia, was highlighted on Wednesday when South Africa's central bank governor, Tito Mboweni, urged a swift resolution to the crisis. \"There's a bit of a negative mood [in the markets] emerging from the events there.

After a long walk and an even longer truck ride he made it to Zambia via Botswana, and received military training for one of the liberation movements, Zapu.</p> <p>By the time he was ready for combat the struggle was over. He returned to a black president, Robert Mugabe, a new country, Zimbabwe, and a new kind of oppression.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe had branded Zapu members, most of whom, like the young Moyo, were from the Ndebele ethnic group, as dissidents. He sent the North Korean-trained fifth brigade to massacre the Ndebele in their thousands.</p> <p>Mr Moyo, now 36, is a candidate for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change in the Matobo district in the forthcoming elections. He says his political motivation is the same now as it was when he packed his bags at 12.</p> <p>\"I left my home to fight for land and freedom. And 20 years after liberation we are waiting for both,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I did not risk my life so that one man or one party could stay in power, but so that we could choose our rulers. And we are still waiting for the land.</p> <p>\"Mugabe has rediscovered the issue for his own political purposes. But for the past two decades he has done nothing about it apart from give it to his friends and cronies.</p> <p>\"So I will just have to continue fighting. And just like before I realise I may even lose my life.\"</p> <p>Like Mr Moyo, Matebeleland is no stranger to conflict. It is in its past - in the late 19th century Cecil Rhodes's troops destroyed Kraal and burned down the main city, Bulawayo, in a desperate search for mineral deposits.</p> <p>It is in its present - Bulawayo is now overrun with white farmers who have fled the countryside since the murder of Martin Olds on Tuesday. They fear a \"hit squad\" of squatters is making its way to the region this weekend to continue the campaign of occupations and political intimidation.</p> <p>And it is in its language. Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, means \"the killing place\"; Ndebele denotes \"those who carry long shields\"; and Mr Mugabe's last reign of terror here in the 80s is known as mkuruhundu - \"the spring rain that washes away the chaff of the last season\".</p> <p>\"There is a distinctly differ ent feeling in this region, even among members of Zanu [Mr Mugabe's ruling party],\" says Shari Eppel, who spent six years investigating the 1983-88 massacres.</p> <p>\"People here know what it is like to come from a region that has been deliberately neglected by this government. And the mkuruhundu means many people know those who were executed or tortured by this government.\"</p> <p>That is why the land occupations were late to catch on in Matabeleland. The first serious attempt by squatters to seize a white farm in the region was repelled by black farm labourers. It took the arrival of Chenjerai \"Hitler\" Hunzvi, the war veterans' leader, to personally take charge of an invasion for the campaign to work. It also explains why squatters are being bussed in to Matebeleland from areas where support for the government is stronger.</p> <p>\"Because of what happened here in the 80s there isn't a lot of heartfelt support for Mugabe,\" says David Colthart, secretary for legal affairs in the Movement for Democratic Change.</p> <p>Two weeks ago there was a huge MDC rally in Nyamandlovhu. That is why they targeted the area earlier this week. In this region Zanu are very worried so they have stepped up the campaign before the elections.\"</p> <p>Ms Eppel believes Mr Mugabe is adopting exactly the same tactics as he did during the mkuruhundu .</p> <p>\"Of course it is not on the same scale,\" she says. \"But he is conflating ethnic tension with political tension. Before he said, 'If you are Zapu you are a dissident.'</p> <p>\"Since Zapu were mostly Ndebele that effectively meant anyone who spoke Ndebele was a target. Now he is saying, 'Whites are enemies of the state.' \"</p> <p>Most Ndebele believe that the only thing that will stop Mr Mugabe this time is international pressure. \"Now that he's made an example of whites I think he will find it politically embarrassing internationally to continue that,\" says Ms Eppel.</p> <p>\"He'll probably start cracking black skulls in the rural areas soon, just like he did before, and the foreign media will lose interest.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "At the age of 12 Lovemore Moyo left the rural district of Matobo in Matabeleland to help liberate Rhodesia from white minority rule. After a long walk and an even longer truck ride he made it to Zambia via Botswana, and received military training for one of the liberation movements, Zapu. By the time he was ready for combat the struggle was over. He returned to a black president, Robert Mugabe, a new country, Zimbabwe, and a new kind of oppression. Mr Mugabe had branded Zapu members, most of whom, like the young Moyo, were from the Ndebele ethnic group, as dissidents. He sent the North Korean-trained fifth brigade to massacre the Ndebele in their thousands. Mr Moyo, now 36, is a candidate for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change in the Matobo district in the forthcoming elections. He says his political motivation is the same now as it was when he packed his bags at 12. \"I left my home to fight for land and freedom. And 20 years after liberation we are waiting for both,\" he says. \"I did not risk my life so that one man or one party could stay in power, but so that we could choose our rulers. And we are still waiting for the land. \"Mugabe has rediscovered the issue for his own political purposes. But for the past two decades he has done nothing about it apart from give it to his friends and cronies. \"So I will just have to continue fighting. And just like before I realise I may even lose my life.\" Like Mr Moyo, Matebeleland is no stranger to conflict. It is in its past - in the late 19th century Cecil Rhodes's troops destroyed Kraal and burned down the main city, Bulawayo, in a desperate search for mineral deposits. It is in its present - Bulawayo is now overrun with white farmers who have fled the countryside since the murder of Martin Olds on Tuesday. They fear a \"hit squad\" of squatters is making its way to the region this weekend to continue the campaign of occupations and political intimidation. And it is in its language. Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, means \"the killing place\"; Ndebele denotes \"those who carry long shields\"; and Mr Mugabe's last reign of terror here in the 80s is known as mkuruhundu - \"the spring rain that washes away the chaff of the last season\". \"There is a distinctly differ ent feeling in this region, even among members of Zanu [Mr Mugabe's ruling party],\" says Shari Eppel, who spent six years investigating the 1983-88 massacres. \"People here know what it is like to come from a region that has been deliberately neglected by this government. And the mkuruhundu means many people know those who were executed or tortured by this government.\" That is why the land occupations were late to catch on in Matabeleland. The first serious attempt by squatters to seize a white farm in the region was repelled by black farm labourers. It took the arrival of Chenjerai \"Hitler\" Hunzvi, the war veterans' leader, to personally take charge of an invasion for the campaign to work. It also explains why squatters are being bussed in to Matebeleland from areas where support for the government is stronger. \"Because of what happened here in the 80s there isn't a lot of heartfelt support for Mugabe,\" says David Colthart, secretary for legal affairs in the Movement for Democratic Change. Two weeks ago there was a huge MDC rally in Nyamandlovhu. That is why they targeted the area earlier this week. In this region Zanu are very worried so they have stepped up the campaign before the elections.\" Ms Eppel believes Mr Mugabe is adopting exactly the same tactics as he did during the mkuruhundu . \"Of course it is not on the same scale,\" she says. \"But he is conflating ethnic tension with political tension. Before he said, 'If you are Zapu you are a dissident.' \"Since Zapu were mostly Ndebele that effectively meant anyone who spoke Ndebele was a target. Now he is saying, 'Whites are enemies of the state.' \" Most Ndebele believe that the only thing that will stop Mr Mugabe this time is international pressure. \"Now that he's made an example of whites I think he will find it politically embarrassing internationally to continue that,\" says Ms Eppel. \"He'll probably start cracking black skulls in the rural areas soon, just like he did before, and the foreign media will lose interest.\"",

A multiracial crowd took to the streets of Harare in a Good Friday procession to call for an end to the violence that threatens to spiral out of control over the ownership of farm land. \"We always pray, but this year we are praying for peace in our country,\" said one participant. \"We're praying for God to give wisdom to our leaders.\" The regional summit at Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls - supposedly to chew over the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - was hijacked by the host country's land crisis. Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of Zimbabwe's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), which poses the biggest challenge to the ruling Zanu-PF party in parliamentary elections next month, called on the leaders to put pressure on Mr Mugabe to resolve the crisis. Despite public pledges made on Wednesday by Mr Mugabe and his ally, the war veterans' leader Chenjerai Hunzvi, that peace would prevail on the white-owned farms, violent attacks have continued against white farmers and many black workers. Black self-styled veterans of Zimbabwe's liberation war in the 1970s have invaded hundreds of farms, obstructing the production of crops on which the country largely depends for food and foreign exchange.

Less than a mile from the roadblock a British army colonel was training a group of more than 50 Zimbabwe army officers in map reading and orienting. \"We are carrying out routine training to improve the Zimbabwe army's peacekeeping capacity,\" said Colonel Aubrey Fletcher, a member of the British military advisory and training team. \"We come to this area every year for this map reading exercise. It just so happens that on this occasion there is trouble nearby.\" The farm invaders have carried out a scorched earth policy: tobacco crops have been burned and fresh flowers ready for export ruined. \"These are the export crops that are supposed to pay for the fuel we are importing and the electricity we are importing,\" Mr Kirton said \"This is crazy. This destruction will only dig this country deeper and deeper into a bottomless pit. Mugabe doesn't care about this country anymore.\" A minister in Mr Mugabe's cabinet was asked at a private meeting yesterday why the government was not obeying court orders and upholding the country's laws. \"This isn't a legal matter, it is a political matter,\" he replied. Mr Mugabe and his supporters may find this a convenient answer, but his critics say that the policy is taking Zimbabwe towards an irreversible course of lawlessness. \"The war veterans have become Mugabe's brownshirts,\" said Iden Wetherell, deputy editor of the Zimbabwe Independent. \"They are his private militia charged with carrying out his campaign of rural terror. They are beyond the reach of law enforcement agencies. \"Mugabe has conducted a coup against the constitution and the law of Zimbabwe.\"",

      "bodyText": "A team of leading human rights lawyers aided by the Chilean government has convinced the supreme court to take legal action against General Augusto Pinochet. Seven weeks after he was released from house arrest in Britain and returned to Chile, the effort to put the former dictator under formal investigation is due to begin next week. A hearing will be held on Wednesday to decide whether he can be stripped of his immunity and tried on human rights charges. In a series of unprecedented government moves against Gen Pinochet, the state defence council has taken an active role in helping the prosecution. Carmen Hertz, a human rights lawyer and author, called the development Chile's \"moment of truth\". \"Now we will see who has the power,\" she said. \"The elected civilian authorities or the military.\" There are rumours circulating that the US will ask for Gen Pinochet's extradition should the Chilean justice system fail to put him on trial. Following up the murder case known as \"The Letelier Bombing\", in which the former Chilean ambassador to the US, Orlando Letelier, and his aide were killed by a terrorist car bombing in Washington 24 years ago, the US justice de partment recently sent a team of FBI investigators to Chile to question key Pinochet aides. But many believe that this was no more than than a public relations effort to satisfy victims of the Pinochet regime. Except in the case of the sometime Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, who was also a close ally of US military intelligence, Washington has avoided charging its former Latin cronies on US soil. Doubts about the Chilean judicial system's ability to work independent of military pressures are being fully tested by the Pinochet case. Under Chilean law, civilian judges are often subservient to their military counterparts and are legally barred from entering military facilities to carry out investigations. As commander in chief of the military junta for nearly 25 years, Gen Pinochet led a government that committed thousands of murders and carried out systematised torture sessions. But because of an amnesty law created by Gen Pinochet himself in Chile's 1980 constitution, and his status as a self-appointed \"senator for life\", he has never been investigated in Chile. Before a criminal case can begin, he must first be stripped of this immunity. Gen Pinochet's lawyers have tried on several occasions to have the case thrown out by submitting medical tests that prove that he is legally \"crazy and demented\", as Chilean law designates those mentally incapable of defending themselves. But there is no provision in the law to let Gen Pinochet's mental condition be a factor in deciding whether he should be stripped of his senatorial privileges. Medical reasons can only be considered later in the process - for example, in a criminal trial. \"The immunity hearing is exclusively focused on two points [the charges of being the intellectual author of 19 assassinations and an accessory to those crimes],\" said Crisologo Burgos, a lawyer for the Chilean government, who is assisting the prosecution. In an effort to deflect the efforts to prosecute him, the 84-year-old general's children reluctantly agreed that their father was mentally ill and unfit for trial. The fact that their decision came after widely publicised haggling with the defence lawyers did little to dampen speculation that the general's mental illness was being managed with military precision. Gen Pinochet's circle of supporters has so withered in the past months that the Pinochet Foundation has reverted to denouncing the pending court actions as plots by '\"extreme leftists\" designed to besmirch the general's good name. In a hasty effort to galvanise that flagging support, the Pinochet defence team has begun working with public relations agencies. The slogans chosen for the new Pinochet image have not yet been released but, based on the recent flurry of confessions by retired military officers, the general's ability to recreate an air of impunity seems to be slim. A recent public opinion poll showed that 50% of Chileans had a very negative impression of the once-revered general. Insanity now appears to be the only recourse that might let the military strongman who just two years ago walked in self-created glory live his last days in relative peace. Eighty-six separate cases are pending against him, and further ones are being filed almost daily. The sheer number of criminal complaints and the hundreds of victims involved have led the investigating judge, Juan Guzman Tapia, to sort the cases chronologically and geographically. The first of them is the 1973 \"Caravan of Death\", in which at least 72 political prisoners were kidnapped and executed by a roving hit squad. The prosecution accuses Gen Pinochet of being the \"intellectual author\" and an accessory to the crimes. The strongest evidence against Gen Pinochet comes from high-ranking military officers who have implicated him in 19 separate assassinations. Sergio Arellano Stark, an army general who is alleged to have led the death squad, is said to have received written orders from Gen Pinochet. Gen Stark and five other senior officers have already been arrested and are being investigated for the Caravan of Death murders. None of them enjoys senatorial immunity. Judge Guzman's interviews with Gen Pinochet's aides have led to unprecedented evidence that he directly ordered assassinations, according to copies of the Guzman documents which were recently published in the Argentine daily Phania 12. In an attempt to save Gen Pinochet, several far-right political groups, including the Independent Democratic Union (UDI), have unsuccessfully sought to cobble together a deal by which the dictator would be allowed a \"dignified exit\" from the political arena without being prosecuted. But the interior minister, Jose Miguel Insulza, has ridiculed the idea. \"These are issues beyond the reach of congress and government,\" he said. \"The Pinochet issue must be resolved in a legal arena.\" The recently elected president, Ricardo Lagos, called the UDI party actions \"inappropriate\". President Lagos has repeatedly insisted that his administration will support the judicial branch. \"There is no doubt that by attempting to influence the conduct of judges, [rightwing senators] have fallen away from their constitutional obligation to respect the independence of the judiciary.\" But despite recent events, there remain many obstacles to a Pinochet trial in Chile. Efforts to televise the initial hearings were rejected by judges as too invasive, and in recent weeks the judges have objected to the public interest in the case, leading many observers to doubt that he will even be investigated. The spectacle of the once feared leader being tried or convicted is, to many Chileans, unthinkable. \"They are not going to do anything in the end,\" said Elda Bravo, 40, a school teacher who believes the country's judiciary is merely making a bit of noise to avoid criticism for its 30 years of inaction. \"The government has never wanted to judge him, they just want Pinochet to retire.\"",

The rottweiler of Downing Street, once feared across Westminster for his savage attacks on those judged insufficiently respectful of his master Tony Blair, has become a gentle poodle. The prime minister's loyal press secretary looks the same and sounds the same, but he is acting and speaking very differently. Brutality has been replaced by kindness, obstruction by co-operation, snarls by smiles and put-downs by praise in one of the most remarkable personality transformations in modern British politics. Renowned for his catchphrase \"Crap - that's C-R-A-P\" to dismiss unwelcome stories, even the swearing has stopped with the apparatchik adopting \"garbagick\" - a phrase more acceptable before the 9pm watershed. The fears of lobby journalists that not everything was quite right were confirmed when Mr Campbell hopped aboard their bus instead of into the back seat of the premier's car during a trip to Wales. \"It's as if the real Alastair Campbell has been kidnapped and a lookalike substituted in his place,\" said an astonished passenger on the coach. \"Either there are two of them or the old one has changed drastically. I bet he really hates having to be so nice all of the time.\" The No 10 press secretary's charm offensive started when he agreed to allow BBC film maker Michael Cockerell to make a fly-on-the-wall documentary on his life as a spin doctor. Mr Campbell's unexpected decision to catch the bus during a tour of south Wales was spoiled slightly by the sight of a camera crew clambering on behind him. An unusual invitation for representatives of the fourth estate to dine with him was marred somewhat by the sound man's mike. Political editors and their partners invited for canapes in Downing Street were disappointed, though by this stage not altogether surprised, to find chats interrupted by the appearance of a boom. And Mr Campbell is even claimed to have worn make-up for the TV lights at one briefing, with a female admirer later claiming it suited him. \"That's complete nonsense, total nonsense,\" said the official spokesman's spokeswoman. Downing Street maintains Mr Campbell has not become a new man for the cameras. The bus shots, said the spokesman's spokeswoman, will not be broadcast after all because Mr Campbell acknowledges they do not represent his normal travel arrangements. \"This is the latest evidence of the phenomenon of the journalist as spin doctor,\" said the spokesman's spokeswoman. \"Ever since we agreed to allow access to the Michael Cockerell documentary crew, journalists both inside and outside the Westminster press corps have been seeking to undermine the whole exercise and this is just the latest attempt. \"The people who have been behaving differently in front of the cameras are the journalists - in some cases asking questions for the very first time, in others asking serious policy questions instead of requesting details of the prime minister's leg measurements. \"We are certain Michael Cockerell is professional enough to make his own assessment. However, the one place he has not been able to gain access to is the Westminster press gallery.\" The BBC said the programme would be broadcast around the time of this autumn's Labour conference. Mr Cockerell is on holiday but a corporation spokesman said: \"We are experienced in making these programmes and know what to look out for.\"",

A war ensues, after which the couple are reunited. He dies. Six children are thereby orphaned*. </p> <p>She also at some stage produces a further child with Stephen, constable of Cardigan (Jude Law), whom she may or may not have married, as well as four others by further unspecified lovers. Her most notable conquest, however, is King Henry I (Michael Douglas) who chances on her while visiting Wales, leaving her with a son, also called Henry. Various busybodies (Thora Hird, Christine Hamilton) like to allege that Nest is the mother of Robert, Earl of Gloucester (Chris Evans) but that is a mere canard (Donald Duck). Director: Mel Gibson.

I blame myself. In the past few weeks I have failed to offer one word of encouragement to this gallant outfit which prospered so mightily after I first drew attention to its long run of bad results late last year. And now my neglect is repaid by another appalling defeat. Post hoc, propter hoc, as one of the wiser ancients observed. </p> <p>Even so, this reverse is less spectacular than the recent result obtained by the Metropolitan Police, a rugby XV, in the Jewson National League, second division, south.

I would like to see Ann Widdecombe pressing Jack Straw, who has charge of the Met under present arrangements, to make a statement to parliament. I would like even more to see her packing down in the second row of the Met Police scrum.

St David's Day, when grown men can be seen with a daffodil pinned to the lapel, no doubt dreaming of the leek soup they have to look forward to. But St George's Day, who gives a damn?</p> <p>In fact most left-leaning Guardian reader pals of mine don't just ignore our national day, they are hard-pressed to even name the date, and when they do finally remember it (actually it is tomorrow) they come over all awkward and agitational about the very idea of celebrating Englishness.</p> <p>\"Long to reign over us, happy and glorious\", the Great British national anthem that is still sung so lustily by the English in place of our own tune, says it all really. We wallow in our subjecthood, unable to break free from an anything-but-United Kingdom.</p> <p>Our independence becomes translated into cutting ourselves off from Europe, the last stand of the little Englander. Who would want to bother with all this baggage?</p> <p>But the creeping realisation that England isn't the same as Britain is becoming irresistible. Hardly surprising when the past 12 months have witnessed the opening of the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the still faltering steps of a Northern Ireland peace settlement. Things are changing at a statist level, yet it is in popular culture that the shift has a real sense of the English dynamic.</p> <p>The nostalgia pics of England's 1966 World Cup triumph show a sea of Union flags in Wembley's stands. The championship mascot was a distinctively British lion, World Cup Willie, complete with Union flag on his chest. Thirty years of hurt later and Euro '96 Wembley was a sea of St George Cross flags. (\"Ingerland!!\").</p> <p>Not a result of diktat or instruction, but a realisation from below that, at least on the football field, the Scots are a foreign nation and England stands apart. From expensive Hackett knitted St George Cross jumpers, to a traditional kitchen designed by the company Plain English, via Sir Terence Conran's latest eating emporium, the George, Englishness has a growing sense of its own fashionable identity.</p> <p>But how can we celebrate it? An all-day showing of Norman Wisdom, Tony Hancock and Fawlty Towers may help even the most self-loathing of the English to realise that for every Bernard Manning or Jim Davidson making a notorious living out of a cruel laugh at others' expense there is a comedy classic founded on our ability to laugh at ourselves. \"Don't mention the war\", or the bumbling bank manager turned wartime antihero Captain Mainwaring - if this isn't the English lightening up, what is?</p> <p>As for food, we love to knock our national non-existent cuisine. But a regional mix of Lancashire hotpot, Yorkshire puddings and cockney jellied eels, rounded off with some Devon clotted cream and scones, suggests a country made up of difference. Perhaps a St George's Day meal should be a double helping of chicken tikka masala and takeaway pizza in tribute to our intestinal internationalism. Or maybe chips with everything?</p> <p>Culinary historians teach us that these are in fact a continental invention, probably Belgian, though their preference for mayonnaise over Heinz tomato ketchup as the spuds' topping has proved an import too far.</p> <p>The fact that our national vegetable dish isn't authentically English doesn't pull down the entire edifice of our emerging national identity. After all, St George himself was a knight of Middle Eastern origin who probably wouldn't pass muster as a genuine refugee or asylum seeker in these hate-filled times.</p> <p>Raymond Williams was one of the first to recognise that England as a \"mongrel nation\" is a potential source of its enduring appeal. Williams was part of a group of 50s historians and cultural theorists who made it their business to engage with the specificities of being English alongside a dogged determination to break up Britain.</p> <p>Writers of impeccable leftist credentials such as Edward Thompson and Christopher Hill were joined later by Tom Nairn, Perry Anderson, Sheila Rowbotham and others in uncovering a history that might help us construct another England.</p> <p>The Fabian Society, from deep within the New Labour edifice, has launched its report, The English Question, a prescient attempt to link this radical championing of an alternative Englishness with the goal of some measure of English devolution.</p> <p>But England shouldn't be reduced simply to constitutionalising. Feeling good about being English is a vital part in bidding farewell to Britain. Not to forget our imperial past, Rule Britannia's ugly refrain \"Britons never shall be slaves\" speaks to a history that will forever be stained. It is time to turn this legacy on its head with a positive blast of Blake's Jerusalem.</p> <p>A passionate call for a new England free of exploitation and pollution which has a multi-faith, and non-faith, resonance well beyond its Christian origins. A rousing rendition will more than likely be helped in its enthusiasm, if not its melody, by sharing in a round of our great national drink, beer.</p> <p>Eccentrically labelled ales such as Theakston's Old Peculiar, Bishop's Finger and the Mordue Brewery's Radgie Gadgie have their place alongside our liking for European wines and continental lagers. The national and the international co-existing in one party six-pack.</p> <p>The soundtrack to my celebration of St George's Day? Well most of Britpop is in fact Eng-pop, Blur and Pulp being the most obvious exponents of a southern, and a northern, sense of being English yet part of a fast-moving world culture.

      "bodyText": "St Patrick's Day, an annual excuse to sink a Guinness or three and come all over Celtic. St Andrew's Day is toasted by piper and a helping of haggis. St David's Day, when grown men can be seen with a daffodil pinned to the lapel, no doubt dreaming of the leek soup they have to look forward to. But St George's Day, who gives a damn? In fact most left-leaning Guardian reader pals of mine don't just ignore our national day, they are hard-pressed to even name the date, and when they do finally remember it (actually it is tomorrow) they come over all awkward and agitational about the very idea of celebrating Englishness. \"Long to reign over us, happy and glorious\", the Great British national anthem that is still sung so lustily by the English in place of our own tune, says it all really. We wallow in our subjecthood, unable to break free from an anything-but-United Kingdom. Our independence becomes translated into cutting ourselves off from Europe, the last stand of the little Englander. Who would want to bother with all this baggage? But the creeping realisation that England isn't the same as Britain is becoming irresistible. Hardly surprising when the past 12 months have witnessed the opening of the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the still faltering steps of a Northern Ireland peace settlement. Things are changing at a statist level, yet it is in popular culture that the shift has a real sense of the English dynamic. The nostalgia pics of England's 1966 World Cup triumph show a sea of Union flags in Wembley's stands. The championship mascot was a distinctively British lion, World Cup Willie, complete with Union flag on his chest. Thirty years of hurt later and Euro '96 Wembley was a sea of St George Cross flags. (\"Ingerland!!\"). Not a result of diktat or instruction, but a realisation from below that, at least on the football field, the Scots are a foreign nation and England stands apart. From expensive Hackett knitted St George Cross jumpers, to a traditional kitchen designed by the company Plain English, via Sir Terence Conran's latest eating emporium, the George, Englishness has a growing sense of its own fashionable identity. But how can we celebrate it? An all-day showing of Norman Wisdom, Tony Hancock and Fawlty Towers may help even the most self-loathing of the English to realise that for every Bernard Manning or Jim Davidson making a notorious living out of a cruel laugh at others' expense there is a comedy classic founded on our ability to laugh at ourselves. \"Don't mention the war\", or the bumbling bank manager turned wartime antihero Captain Mainwaring - if this isn't the English lightening up, what is? As for food, we love to knock our national non-existent cuisine. But a regional mix of Lancashire hotpot, Yorkshire puddings and cockney jellied eels, rounded off with some Devon clotted cream and scones, suggests a country made up of difference. Perhaps a St George's Day meal should be a double helping of chicken tikka masala and takeaway pizza in tribute to our intestinal internationalism. Or maybe chips with everything? Culinary historians teach us that these are in fact a continental invention, probably Belgian, though their preference for mayonnaise over Heinz tomato ketchup as the spuds' topping has proved an import too far. The fact that our national vegetable dish isn't authentically English doesn't pull down the entire edifice of our emerging national identity. After all, St George himself was a knight of Middle Eastern origin who probably wouldn't pass muster as a genuine refugee or asylum seeker in these hate-filled times. Raymond Williams was one of the first to recognise that England as a \"mongrel nation\" is a potential source of its enduring appeal. Williams was part of a group of 50s historians and cultural theorists who made it their business to engage with the specificities of being English alongside a dogged determination to break up Britain. Writers of impeccable leftist credentials such as Edward Thompson and Christopher Hill were joined later by Tom Nairn, Perry Anderson, Sheila Rowbotham and others in uncovering a history that might help us construct another England. The Fabian Society, from deep within the New Labour edifice, has launched its report, The English Question, a prescient attempt to link this radical championing of an alternative Englishness with the goal of some measure of English devolution. But England shouldn't be reduced simply to constitutionalising. Feeling good about being English is a vital part in bidding farewell to Britain. Not to forget our imperial past, Rule Britannia's ugly refrain \"Britons never shall be slaves\" speaks to a history that will forever be stained. It is time to turn this legacy on its head with a positive blast of Blake's Jerusalem. A passionate call for a new England free of exploitation and pollution which has a multi-faith, and non-faith, resonance well beyond its Christian origins. A rousing rendition will more than likely be helped in its enthusiasm, if not its melody, by sharing in a round of our great national drink, beer. Eccentrically labelled ales such as Theakston's Old Peculiar, Bishop's Finger and the Mordue Brewery's Radgie Gadgie have their place alongside our liking for European wines and continental lagers. The national and the international co-existing in one party six-pack. The soundtrack to my celebration of St George's Day? Well most of Britpop is in fact Eng-pop, Blur and Pulp being the most obvious exponents of a southern, and a northern, sense of being English yet part of a fast-moving world culture. Drum and bass, jungle, and a dose of new Asian dance music all sound like a national culture that can absorb and include as well as it can repel and exclude. A homegrown dance music play-list is a testament to an Englishness that is urban, yet enjoys itself in a rural festival site and joins the European youth-tribe in Ibiza every summer just to prove its cosmopolitan credentials. Of an age when the music can start all sounding the same, I'll stick to Billy Bragg, the Clash's English Civil War and Steel Pulse's Brum reggae mix for my favourite English party tunes. And if I get round to baking my celebratory fairy cakes topped with an icing sugar St George's Cross I'll have the party food, and my masculinity, sorted. Meanwhile the big picture writers tell me every step on the way towards globalisation is matched by a parallel intensification of localisation. Internationalism is only possible in the face of globalisation once we know where we are coming from. Learning to celebrate St George's Day is a small yet significant part of that process. It is about all our yesterdays, it is for a better tomorrow too. Mark Perryman is editor of The Ingerland Factor: Home Truths from Football, published by Mainstream, \u00a39.99",

In the other eliminator, Hypno-Disc, with its 600rpm rotating wheel and unpleasant spikes, confronted Steg-O-Saw-Us, with suggestive knobbles along its back and a thumping dinosaur's tail powered, I believe, by a lawnmower engine. </p> <p>Robot Wars is a very strange spectacle, rather like WWF wrestling meets Young Scientist of the Year, or Operation Desert Storm meets county-level table tennis. The film-maker Nanni Moretti once dramatised the history of the Italian communist party as a game of water polo. Robot Wars is of the same stamp, the hostility of the western male sublimated into something less troubling, something that can be knocked up in the garage and then unleashed like a screaming id on wheels. </p> <p>Most of this final episode consisted of action replays from the 16-heat series, in which 600 robots were slashed, burned and symbolically defiled. There was a coffin on wheels that got flung into a pit, which was some kind of poetic justice. There were robots called Sir Killalot, Judge Shred, Toe Cutter and Plunderbird. There were others whose names make less sense, such as Facet. And others which were intentionally wrongly spelled, such as Prizephita. There wasn't one called Effete or Poetry Reading, which was a shame. </p> <p>Commentator Jonathan Pearce was particularly unfeeling when he reported on the defeat of Big Cheese, a motorised yellow triangle on wheels. \"Big Cheese thought they were fondue for success, but they were grated,\" said Pearce in that purportedly punning martial-speak beloved of football commentators who have a misplaced sense of the game's importance. Fondue?

      "bodyText": "In the Grand Final eliminators for Robot Wars (BBC2), Chance II with its flipping ramp was pitted against Firestorm with its flipping arm. \"Flipping\" was used descriptively here. In the other eliminator, Hypno-Disc, with its 600rpm rotating wheel and unpleasant spikes, confronted Steg-O-Saw-Us, with suggestive knobbles along its back and a thumping dinosaur's tail powered, I believe, by a lawnmower engine. Robot Wars is a very strange spectacle, rather like WWF wrestling meets Young Scientist of the Year, or Operation Desert Storm meets county-level table tennis. The film-maker Nanni Moretti once dramatised the history of the Italian communist party as a game of water polo. Robot Wars is of the same stamp, the hostility of the western male sublimated into something less troubling, something that can be knocked up in the garage and then unleashed like a screaming id on wheels. Most of this final episode consisted of action replays from the 16-heat series, in which 600 robots were slashed, burned and symbolically defiled. There was a coffin on wheels that got flung into a pit, which was some kind of poetic justice. There were robots called Sir Killalot, Judge Shred, Toe Cutter and Plunderbird. There were others whose names make less sense, such as Facet. And others which were intentionally wrongly spelled, such as Prizephita. There wasn't one called Effete or Poetry Reading, which was a shame. Commentator Jonathan Pearce was particularly unfeeling when he reported on the defeat of Big Cheese, a motorised yellow triangle on wheels. \"Big Cheese thought they were fondue for success, but they were grated,\" said Pearce in that purportedly punning martial-speak beloved of football commentators who have a misplaced sense of the game's importance. Fondue? How does that joke work? The real conflict, though, was between the shrieking presenters (Craig Charles and Philippa Forester) and the all-male robot operators, many of whom wore sweatshirts over their ordinary shirts but with the collars arranged nicely over the top. The latter were the kind of people who would quite possibly also have been regular participants on Why Don't You Just Switch off Your Television Set and Go and Do Something Less Boring Instead.

      "body": "<p>Everybody knows the best place to think up ideas. Eureka - that's right, in the bath and if that bath's in the home of an inventor in Ohio all the better. That's where Michael Ross was sitting not so long ago when his idea came to him and so it was goodbye Columbus and back home to open his first business while still at university. Now, barely 10 years later, he runs one of the biggest e-commerce knicker shops in the UK.</p> <p>\"I was up at Trinity where I helped launch the Cambridge Comedy Society, the most unsuccessful and unfunny comedy group ever. One weekend we were running a stand selling cartoons for charity when an American tourist, Michael Braunstein, stopped by and began chatting about humour.</p> <p>\"I didn't hear from Mr Braunstein for two years and then he called me up and told me he had given up script writing and had become an inventor and invited me to stay with him and look over his latest invention.</p> <p>\"It was Christmas 1989 and in his huge house he had built his weather patio. I had brought a friend who likes photography with me and we sat in his Jacuzzi trying to think of ideas for putting this weather room on the map. Instead, this made us think of an idea that might work for us back in England.</p> <p>\"The next year, we opened a map business and started selling aerial views of Cambridge to local businesses who could put their names on the map and give them away to customers.\"</p> <p>The business grew and three years later they were selling 52 maps across the UK, employing 37 people and doing a million pounds worth of business and still losing money. \"We made every mistake a small business can make and we were fed up and decided it was time to quit.\"</p> <p>By this time, Michael Ross was being head-hunted at university by McKinsey and joined them in 1994. At first working on future uses for TV, he was soon moved on to \"internet stuff\". For five years he thought about quitting McKinsey. Then he enjoyed another break through his mother's cousin Daniel Nabarro. Unlike other City high-flyers, quitting and setting up his own internet company with all the attendant risks, he was able to join a family firm. He left a lucrative job as consultant at McKinsey in December 1998, when he was taken on as chief executive of easyshop. This retailer had been set up in 1995 and was funded by Mr Nabarro. As competition in that area hotted up, Mr Nabarro redirected the company's activities to e-commerce. In late 1998, easyshop.co.uk opened selling women's under-wear. As Mr Nabarro started to spend serious money getting the business up and running he looked to young Michael Ross who had shown an aptitude for the internet in talks at family get-togethers, and made him the boss.</p> <p>\"When my uncle (as he calls him) asked me to come and work for him, I could see that selling underwear on the net was an inspired choice of product. It is the best selling item of clothing on the internet for the simple reason that most women know their bra and knicker sizes and the brand they prefer. Moreover, it's light and cheaper to post.\"</p> <p>As he shows me around his North Finchley packing room, Mr Ross says: \"Fashion people don't understand the net. Calvin Klein and Hugo Boss don't want to know. Maybe they are just biding their time, but for now they are chary.\"</p> <p>And it's big -some \u00a33bn annually in the UK alone with Marks &amp; Spencer accounting for some 40% of sales. Easyshop, by contrast, is selling just \u00a31m a year. \"We are minuscule,\" he admits, \"for the moment\".</p> <p>Why North Finchley? \"In selling underwear on the web, the trick is speed,\" he says. \"My uncle was told about the excellent postal sorting office nearby and that was a major factor.</p> <p>\"Just imagine, a young lady could get home from work in the evening, throw her dirty underwear in the basket, send us an e-mail and a replacement set will drop through the letterbox next morning.\"</p> <p>The secret, apparently, is a golf wagon to roam the aisles and quickly find the right size and brand. Find it, put it in an envelope and then sort it before sending the package to the Post Office. \"We can take an order up to 10 o'clock at night,\" he says.</p> <p>Now Mr Ross has his sights on Europe. Moonkiss.com is the working title for an online shopping arm due to make its debut in the spring with delivery anywhere in Europe.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Everybody knows the best place to think up ideas. Eureka - that's right, in the bath and if that bath's in the home of an inventor in Ohio all the better. That's where Michael Ross was sitting not so long ago when his idea came to him and so it was goodbye Columbus and back home to open his first business while still at university. Now, barely 10 years later, he runs one of the biggest e-commerce knicker shops in the UK. \"I was up at Trinity where I helped launch the Cambridge Comedy Society, the most unsuccessful and unfunny comedy group ever. One weekend we were running a stand selling cartoons for charity when an American tourist, Michael Braunstein, stopped by and began chatting about humour. \"I didn't hear from Mr Braunstein for two years and then he called me up and told me he had given up script writing and had become an inventor and invited me to stay with him and look over his latest invention. \"It was Christmas 1989 and in his huge house he had built his weather patio. I had brought a friend who likes photography with me and we sat in his Jacuzzi trying to think of ideas for putting this weather room on the map. Instead, this made us think of an idea that might work for us back in England. \"The next year, we opened a map business and started selling aerial views of Cambridge to local businesses who could put their names on the map and give them away to customers.\" The business grew and three years later they were selling 52 maps across the UK, employing 37 people and doing a million pounds worth of business and still losing money. \"We made every mistake a small business can make and we were fed up and decided it was time to quit.\" By this time, Michael Ross was being head-hunted at university by McKinsey and joined them in 1994. At first working on future uses for TV, he was soon moved on to \"internet stuff\". For five years he thought about quitting McKinsey. Then he enjoyed another break through his mother's cousin Daniel Nabarro. Unlike other City high-flyers, quitting and setting up his own internet company with all the attendant risks, he was able to join a family firm. He left a lucrative job as consultant at McKinsey in December 1998, when he was taken on as chief executive of easyshop. This retailer had been set up in 1995 and was funded by Mr Nabarro. As competition in that area hotted up, Mr Nabarro redirected the company's activities to e-commerce. In late 1998, easyshop.co.uk opened selling women's under-wear. As Mr Nabarro started to spend serious money getting the business up and running he looked to young Michael Ross who had shown an aptitude for the internet in talks at family get-togethers, and made him the boss. \"When my uncle (as he calls him) asked me to come and work for him, I could see that selling underwear on the net was an inspired choice of product. It is the best selling item of clothing on the internet for the simple reason that most women know their bra and knicker sizes and the brand they prefer. Moreover, it's light and cheaper to post.\" As he shows me around his North Finchley packing room, Mr Ross says: \"Fashion people don't understand the net. Calvin Klein and Hugo Boss don't want to know. Maybe they are just biding their time, but for now they are chary.\" And it's big -some \u00a33bn annually in the UK alone with Marks &amp; Spencer accounting for some 40% of sales. Easyshop, by contrast, is selling just \u00a31m a year. \"We are minuscule,\" he admits, \"for the moment\". Why North Finchley? \"In selling underwear on the web, the trick is speed,\" he says. \"My uncle was told about the excellent postal sorting office nearby and that was a major factor. \"Just imagine, a young lady could get home from work in the evening, throw her dirty underwear in the basket, send us an e-mail and a replacement set will drop through the letterbox next morning.\" The secret, apparently, is a golf wagon to roam the aisles and quickly find the right size and brand. Find it, put it in an envelope and then sort it before sending the package to the Post Office. \"We can take an order up to 10 o'clock at night,\" he says. Now Mr Ross has his sights on Europe. Moonkiss.com is the working title for an online shopping arm due to make its debut in the spring with delivery anywhere in Europe.",

The customs and excise is recruiting an extra 955 staff as part of a \u00a3209m drive against smugglers trading in everything from tobacco, drink, cocaine, heroin and pornography to rare species of animals.</p> <p>\"We want to attract applications from a wide range of backgrounds to reflect the diversity of the real world they will be dealing with,\" says Mike Rickwood, the department's head of personnel management. \"More women and people from ethnic minorities would be particularly welcome.\"</p> <p>There are exciting and varied careers available both on the frontline, say as a customs officer, or in a headquarters role advising on strategy. Apart from tackling crime, the department also has the vital role of collecting more than 40% of central government taxation every year via sources such as customs and other duties and VAT.</p> <p>But whether you fancy yourself as a would-be James Bond or the female equivalent foiling plans to flood Britain with contraband cigarettes or as a genius with figures able to crack the most sophisticated VAT fraud, the first hurdle will be passing the department's selection process.</p> <p>Entry for those who can expect to move quickly into key anti-smuggling posts will join at job band 5/6 level (formerly known as executive officers) via an interview lasting about 40 minutes. Less qualified applicants enter at lower levels, but are offered the chance to climb a well-defined career ladder. (See opposite for grade and pay structure).</p> <p>\"We expect candidates to know something about what we do as a department,\" says Mr Rickwood. (Tip: visit the department's internet site on <a href=\"http://www.hmce.gov\" target=\"_NEW\">www.hmce.gov</a>) \"But while the work and life experience of older applicants can be extremely useful, we are very keen to develop potential. The interview is used to look for evidence of bright, inquiring minds that can be stretched by the demanding work we do.\"</p> <p>The department values in particular team players, interpersonal skills and adaptability - and applicants are well advised to prepare examples of how they have demonstrated these qualities. Specialist knowledge should always be highlighted as the department's remit calls for varied expertise - everything from court room knowledge to computer skills.</p> <p>Those offered jobs will typically spend up to nine months training for their first post. Talent spotting by senior managers is used to identify aptitudes at an early stage and steer staff to where they can be most effective. Development centres fast-track those showing the greatest promise.</p> <p>Graduates making their mark can expect to reach an annual salary scale of between \u00a334,000 and \u00a342,000 within six years. \"We encourage staff to gain the widest possible experience within the department and through secondments to other parts of the civil service and the private sector,\" says Mr Rickwood. \"The aim is for individuals to balance their specialist expertise with a grasp of the 'big picture'.\"</p> <p>The emphasis of the current recruitment drive is on reversing the upward trend in tobacco smuggling and was announced after the latest increase in tobacco duty unveiled in the budget.</p> <p>So what specific qualities are needed on the front line at Britain's ports and airports? \"Frontier staff wage a never-ending battle of wits which requires the painstaking gathering of intelligence information, unflagging vigilance and the ability to think clearly on your feet, even at the end of a long shift,\" says Ian Davies, a team leader in the department's headquarters anti-smuggling division.</p> <p>\"We are not only dealing with the relatively crude methods of White Van Man chancing his arm with cigarettes and drink, but with sophisticated international gangs trying to smuggle huge quantities of tobacco as well as hard drugs, pornography and anything else on which they seek to make money.\"</p> <p>He says customs officers often have to make split-second decisions about who to stop and, depending on responses to questions, on the scale of follow-up searches and inquiries.</p> <p>All 'front line' officers complete 13-week individually tailored training programmes which include a residential course where experienced colleagues play the role of smugglers using the latest scams and lines in 'chat'.

      "bodyText": "New opportunities are on offer for a career that can combine crime fighting and intelligence gathering with the knowledge that you are also helping to protect government finances. The customs and excise is recruiting an extra 955 staff as part of a \u00a3209m drive against smugglers trading in everything from tobacco, drink, cocaine, heroin and pornography to rare species of animals. \"We want to attract applications from a wide range of backgrounds to reflect the diversity of the real world they will be dealing with,\" says Mike Rickwood, the department's head of personnel management. \"More women and people from ethnic minorities would be particularly welcome.\" There are exciting and varied careers available both on the frontline, say as a customs officer, or in a headquarters role advising on strategy. Apart from tackling crime, the department also has the vital role of collecting more than 40% of central government taxation every year via sources such as customs and other duties and VAT. But whether you fancy yourself as a would-be James Bond or the female equivalent foiling plans to flood Britain with contraband cigarettes or as a genius with figures able to crack the most sophisticated VAT fraud, the first hurdle will be passing the department's selection process. Entry for those who can expect to move quickly into key anti-smuggling posts will join at job band 5/6 level (formerly known as executive officers) via an interview lasting about 40 minutes. Less qualified applicants enter at lower levels, but are offered the chance to climb a well-defined career ladder. (See opposite for grade and pay structure). \"We expect candidates to know something about what we do as a department,\" says Mr Rickwood. (Tip: visit the department's internet site on www.hmce.gov) \"But while the work and life experience of older applicants can be extremely useful, we are very keen to develop potential. The interview is used to look for evidence of bright, inquiring minds that can be stretched by the demanding work we do.\" The department values in particular team players, interpersonal skills and adaptability - and applicants are well advised to prepare examples of how they have demonstrated these qualities. Specialist knowledge should always be highlighted as the department's remit calls for varied expertise - everything from court room knowledge to computer skills. Those offered jobs will typically spend up to nine months training for their first post. Talent spotting by senior managers is used to identify aptitudes at an early stage and steer staff to where they can be most effective. Development centres fast-track those showing the greatest promise. Graduates making their mark can expect to reach an annual salary scale of between \u00a334,000 and \u00a342,000 within six years. \"We encourage staff to gain the widest possible experience within the department and through secondments to other parts of the civil service and the private sector,\" says Mr Rickwood. \"The aim is for individuals to balance their specialist expertise with a grasp of the 'big picture'.\" The emphasis of the current recruitment drive is on reversing the upward trend in tobacco smuggling and was announced after the latest increase in tobacco duty unveiled in the budget. So what specific qualities are needed on the front line at Britain's ports and airports? \"Frontier staff wage a never-ending battle of wits which requires the painstaking gathering of intelligence information, unflagging vigilance and the ability to think clearly on your feet, even at the end of a long shift,\" says Ian Davies, a team leader in the department's headquarters anti-smuggling division. \"We are not only dealing with the relatively crude methods of White Van Man chancing his arm with cigarettes and drink, but with sophisticated international gangs trying to smuggle huge quantities of tobacco as well as hard drugs, pornography and anything else on which they seek to make money.\" He says customs officers often have to make split-second decisions about who to stop and, depending on responses to questions, on the scale of follow-up searches and inquiries. All 'front line' officers complete 13-week individually tailored training programmes which include a residential course where experienced colleagues play the role of smugglers using the latest scams and lines in 'chat'. Mock interviews are seen as an effective way of teaching new recruits to tell fact from fiction when assessing answers to their questions.\" When new methods of smuggling and new trends emerge, we make sure every officer is informed,\" says Mr Davies. \"Every section of the department works as a team, sharing information and offering mutual support - it is one of our greatest strengths.\" The additional staff being taken on will allow an extra 520 customs officers to be deployed in key border and inland locations including 170 at channel ports. Investigation teams targeting large-scale smuggling gangs will be boosted by 310 staff; intelligence staff based here and abroad will be increased by 95 and there will be 30 new posts in the customs solicitors office.

      "body": "<p>The Easter weekend could see you run ragged as you ply back and forth to the cashpoint. While dyed boiled eggs for breakfast, a clean handkerchief for church, a walk through a bluebell wood and a few chocolate bunnies for tea may have kept children enthralled years ago, today your family day out will need to have a bit more pizzazz built in.</p> <p>If you're a dream parent, the minute you hear: \"I'm bored!\", you reach for your stock of envelopes, which you fan out, Cilla-style, asking: \"Who's going to choose?\", as your wide-eyed children select from a dazzling array of days out at Alton Towers, Legoland or Disneyland Paris, choices which are bound to make you popular and guaranteed to drain your wallet.</p> <p>But if you're looking for value days out or even freebies, museums should be the number one family trip. While the Government's election manifesto included a pledge to make entrances to national museums and galleries free, it has transpired that due to a tax problem, some of the existing \"charging\" museums might actually prefer to continue with their entrance fees. Once a museum stops charging for entrance, it technically loses its status as a business and is therefore no longer entitled to VAT benefits. The current state of the debate is that Chris Smith, the culture secretary, has suggested that entrance fees should not be free, but reduced to \u00a31 for all adults from September 2001. Children and the over-60s will continue to be entitled to free admission.</p> <p>Yet for a museum such as the Science Museum, which currently charges \u00a36.95 for adults, this would result in a substantial reduction in income. The debate continues, with the Government needing to offer compensation to the current \"chargers\" to make up for their box office losses.</p> <p>The \"Quids In\" policy has been described by the Science Museum Director, Sir Neil Cossons, as \"innovative\", but it remains to be seen whether some of the charging museums will in fact reduce their admission fees to \u00a31 next year.</p> <p>While you're waiting for 2001, you may well be attracted by other fun spots where children are admitted for free. But the \"When is a child not a child?\" question is rather a grey area, with many places reckoning that children become adults when they hit 14, yet others stick resolutely to 16. And \"child\" often only kicks in after the age of 3, 4 or 5, according to the whim of the organisation.</p> <p>So, whether you're loaded or strapped for cash, here are some ideas for doing the family thing before the children go back to school. Prices are based on two adults and two children.</p> <p><b>\u00a3500 and over:</b></p> <p>An army of 1.5m Brits will be heading off abroad this weekend, with Spain the most popular destination.

While dyed boiled eggs for breakfast, a clean handkerchief for church, a walk through a bluebell wood and a few chocolate bunnies for tea may have kept children enthralled years ago, today your family day out will need to have a bit more pizzazz built in. If you're a dream parent, the minute you hear: \"I'm bored!\", you reach for your stock of envelopes, which you fan out, Cilla-style, asking: \"Who's going to choose?\", as your wide-eyed children select from a dazzling array of days out at Alton Towers, Legoland or Disneyland Paris, choices which are bound to make you popular and guaranteed to drain your wallet. But if you're looking for value days out or even freebies, museums should be the number one family trip. While the Government's election manifesto included a pledge to make entrances to national museums and galleries free, it has transpired that due to a tax problem, some of the existing \"charging\" museums might actually prefer to continue with their entrance fees. Once a museum stops charging for entrance, it technically loses its status as a business and is therefore no longer entitled to VAT benefits. The current state of the debate is that Chris Smith, the culture secretary, has suggested that entrance fees should not be free, but reduced to \u00a31 for all adults from September 2001. Children and the over-60s will continue to be entitled to free admission. Yet for a museum such as the Science Museum, which currently charges \u00a36.95 for adults, this would result in a substantial reduction in income. The debate continues, with the Government needing to offer compensation to the current \"chargers\" to make up for their box office losses. The \"Quids In\" policy has been described by the Science Museum Director, Sir Neil Cossons, as \"innovative\", but it remains to be seen whether some of the charging museums will in fact reduce their admission fees to \u00a31 next year. While you're waiting for 2001, you may well be attracted by other fun spots where children are admitted for free. But the \"When is a child not a child?\" question is rather a grey area, with many places reckoning that children become adults when they hit 14, yet others stick resolutely to 16. And \"child\" often only kicks in after the age of 3, 4 or 5, according to the whim of the organisation. So, whether you're loaded or strapped for cash, here are some ideas for doing the family thing before the children go back to school. Prices are based on two adults and two children. \u00a3500 and over: An army of 1.5m Brits will be heading off abroad this weekend, with Spain the most popular destination.

The actions allow a glimpse of change. We are catalysts of hope and possibility,\" says one of the five.</p> <p>\"Our role is to inspire people,\" says another. \"The creativity, craziness and cheek helps. It's not about lobbying parliament - it's about saying 'Let's turn the centre of global capitalism into a party', or 'Let's take over an eight-lane motorway'. We want to show people some positive alternatives.\"</p> <p>The five agree that RTS went beyond single issue environmental events years ago. It now seems to be moving towards a broad social ecology political analysis. It represents a fundamental shift away from many environmentalists who see nature and man as separate. Today RTS's thinkers - and there are many - see themselves as part of the rapidly evolving rainbow of global grassroots concern, linking social and ecological justice, human rights, debt, marginalised peoples and anti-racism, that was seen at Seattle.</p> <p>Uniformly against globalisation, the five say they owe little to the old left and have no links with leftwing parties. Their inspirations, they say, come not from books or ideologies such as Marxism or socialism, but from their \"everyday life experiences\" of the \"insanity\" and injustice they see around them.</p> <p>\"People to a large extent are informed by the struggle in their own lives, to put bread on the table, pay the bills,\" says one.</p> <p>What they all find exciting is the ping-pong of inspiration, going backwards and forwards. \"For instance, we helped inspire Seattle, now we in Britain are being inspired by people in the US. The whole thing has gone global. Before June 18 [the J18 City riots] it was largely theoretical. Now there are global days of protest everywhere,\" says one of the five.</p> <p><b> Greed</b><br></p> <p>The group say they are broadly persuaded that the global system is now beyond reform. \"There is massive disillusionment with the economic hierarchy and authoritarian structures. It's at an unprecedented level. Capitalism at its core rewards the darker side of human nature - greed, competitiveness and egotism. We want to see the tables turned upside down and to dance on the tables. It is not possible to reform the beast.\"</p> <p>They claim that violence on May Day will largely come from the police and will be triggered by their presence in such large numbers. \"Effectively you will have thousands of armed people in armour turning up, being opposed by people with seeds and saplings. If there is a huge police presence there will be a riot. If there's only a small one, then all that will probably happen is that we'll disrupt the traffic. A massive police presence will create a different atmosphere that would be conducive to violence.\"</p> <p>They believe that the police will be looking for trouble. But they accept that protesters who intend violence from the outset will come along too.</p> <p>Several of the five admit they will be unable to control the violence. They have been holding workshops on non-violent direct action, hoping, they say, to show that violence is not effective as a catalyst for change.</p> <p>\"I personally do not know one person who will be confronting the police on May Day,\" says one of the group. \"I don't want to work with anyone who seeks violence,\" says another.</p> <p>But the fact that RTS neither condones nor condemns violence makes it easy for the police to condemn them as terrorists. \"Judging things morally is not necessarily productive,\" says one. \"I don't think condemning helps the issues. It may actually worsen the situation.\"</p>",

Today RTS's thinkers - and there are many - see themselves as part of the rapidly evolving rainbow of global grassroots concern, linking social and ecological justice, human rights, debt, marginalised peoples and anti-racism, that was seen at Seattle. Uniformly against globalisation, the five say they owe little to the old left and have no links with leftwing parties. Their inspirations, they say, come not from books or ideologies such as Marxism or socialism, but from their \"everyday life experiences\" of the \"insanity\" and injustice they see around them. \"People to a large extent are informed by the struggle in their own lives, to put bread on the table, pay the bills,\" says one. What they all find exciting is the ping-pong of inspiration, going backwards and forwards. \"For instance, we helped inspire Seattle, now we in Britain are being inspired by people in the US. The whole thing has gone global. Before June 18 [the J18 City riots] it was largely theoretical. Now there are global days of protest everywhere,\" says one of the five. Greed The group say they are broadly persuaded that the global system is now beyond reform. \"There is massive disillusionment with the economic hierarchy and authoritarian structures. It's at an unprecedented level. Capitalism at its core rewards the darker side of human nature - greed, competitiveness and egotism. We want to see the tables turned upside down and to dance on the tables. It is not possible to reform the beast.\" They claim that violence on May Day will largely come from the police and will be triggered by their presence in such large numbers. \"Effectively you will have thousands of armed people in armour turning up, being opposed by people with seeds and saplings. If there is a huge police presence there will be a riot. If there's only a small one, then all that will probably happen is that we'll disrupt the traffic. A massive police presence will create a different atmosphere that would be conducive to violence.\" They believe that the police will be looking for trouble. But they accept that protesters who intend violence from the outset will come along too. Several of the five admit they will be unable to control the violence. They have been holding workshops on non-violent direct action, hoping, they say, to show that violence is not effective as a catalyst for change. \"I personally do not know one person who will be confronting the police on May Day,\" says one of the group. \"I don't want to work with anyone who seeks violence,\" says another. But the fact that RTS neither condones nor condemns violence makes it easy for the police to condemn them as terrorists. \"Judging things morally is not necessarily productive,\" says one. \"I don't think condemning helps the issues. It may actually worsen the situation.\"",

The men will face magistrates in Leeds on May 4 accused of a range of offences, including affray, using threatening behaviour, and being drunk and disorderly. Three other men arrested for criminal damage and car theft are expected to be charged later today. Six more, including two Turks who were arrested for their own safety after unveil ing their national flag at a tense moment during the evening, were released without charge. Police said that overall the city had escaped lightly from a night which was widely dreaded following the murder of two United fans in Istanbul before the first leg. \"I would like to pay tribute to the people of Leeds for keeping their cool,\" said the West Yorkshire assistant chief constable, Paul Garvin, who headed the \u00a3100,000 security operation. \"Tensions were obviously running high but I'm pleased that the outcome was no worse than a normal high security game. \"There was a small outbreak of disorder prior to the game involving known trouble makers but that was soon quelled - their actions were little different to those on most match days. I would also like to pay tribute to our officers for their professional planning and handling of the event, and to Leeds United for the way they handled a difficult situation.\" There was widespread relief in Leeds at the end of the dismal episode which started with provocative behaviour by Leeds fans in Istanbul, including \"mooning\" from buses and insulting local women and the Turkish flag. In the street-fighting which followed, pub landlord Kevin Speight, 40, and fibre-optics engineer Chris Loftus, 37, neither of whom had been involved in the rowdiness, were stabbed to death. Although minor by comparison, the violence in Leeds made a mockery of appeals by the club - including full-page advertisements in national newspapers - for a peaceful evening. Just before kick-off about 100 fans attacked a police video surveillance team and tried to beat up four TV camera crews, one Turkish. A brick was thrown at a coach carrying Turkish club officials, smashing a window, and Galatasaray striker Hakan Sukur was hit on the pitch by a missile, in an incident which has been reported to Uefa. The Turkish team left for Istanbul by plane from Leeds-Bradford airport soon after the game. One Leeds fan, who has not been named, suffered a suspected heart attack shortly before kick-off and died in hospital.

      "bodyText": "A \"death zone\" at Eastbourne in which hundreds of coastal homes are being built and many more are planned will no longer be protected from the sea by the Environment Agency, the organisation has warned. The agency said it was forced into the warning by an imminent planning application by Beazer Homes, which wants to build many more houses in the most vulnerable area at the biggest marina complex in Europe. It said the land owners, Sovereign Harbour, had failed to honour a 1988 agreement to bolster the sea defences in the area and the agency was not prepared to step in with taxpayers money. Already nearly one third of 3,000 planned homes at the Sovereign Harbour development are occupied by people who have no idea of the serious danger the agency says they are in. They each pay the property company \u00a3125 a year towards the cost of the sea defences. Ray Kemp, a spokesman for the agency, said: \"Our engineers call the area where Beazer Homes want to build the 'death zone'. \"They believe that in the next big storm - like the one that hit France at Christmas - houses in this area will be washed away like matchsticks.\" Carillion, formerly the Tarmac company, the owners of Sovereign Harbour, said it was in dispute with the Environment Agency over the 1988 agreement which, in its view, made the agency responsible for maintaining the foreshore. \"The agency cannot legally or morally dissociate itself from the agreement,\" a spokesman for the company said. The area to the north of Eastbourne has been ear marked for a prestige development surrounding the marina and yachting club. It was the building of the harbour which caused part of the problem because the shingle piles up on the west side. It then has to be regularly shifted to the east side to prevent the sea breaching the defences. Beazer Homes said last night it was \"surprised\" about the warning the agency had issued and would be investigating before it decided to go ahead with construction plans. Ian Hayes, development manager for Eastbourne council, said: \"The agency has been raising objections to further development in this area for some time but we are powerless to prevent it.\" He said outline planning permission was given on the Beazer Homes site in 1997 \"so we cannot stop it\". The problem for potential house buyers was that the lack of sea defences does not show on a solicitor's search, he said. Roger Wesson, one of the first residents in the area in 1992, said: \"We have been sent packs about what to do in the event of a flood, and we have had warnings, but nothing has happened. \"I have no idea how serious the situation is.

But the everyday reality is that the Church of England is an institution in steady decline, with a 22% drop in attendances in the 1990s. Today, in the first of a two-part examination of the state of the church, we chart the demise of its traditional role.</p> <p>The Rev Bernard Rumbold is preparing for a busy Easter. He will spend it driving his ancient MG sports car along the winding lanes of his enormous rural parish in north Worcestershire, shuttling between the five churches - all once with their own vicars - which now make up his area.</p> <p>As vicar of north Teme, his parish stretches from the Herefordshire border to Shropshire, an area of 50 square miles in which he is the only permanent man of religion, and where just 50 of the 1,500 residents attend church regularly.</p> <p>For this he earns the standard clergy stipend of \u00a316,500, plus the use of his modern vicarage at the foot of the garden of the old Georgian rectory, which is owned by a millionaire.</p> <p>This is the pattern for many rural vicars these days - increasingly large parishes, filled with ancient, crumbling, even semi-derelict churches which remain a central part of England's heritage.</p> <p>\"I will probably be the last rector of north Teme. When I retire I'm sure they'll amalgamate the parish even more,\" said Mr Rumbold, pondering the possibility of parishes serving 10 or a dozen villages and churches.</p> <p>He has two 11th century churches, mystic, quiet places set among fields of sheep where people have worshipped for more than 1,000 years; one 18th century church built by a squire, and two churches built in the 19th century for congregations of miners and farmworkers. Each could hold several times the combined number of worshippers that now attend church in the valley each Sunday.</p> <p><b> Isolation and poverty</b><br></p> <p>Along the valley there is rural isolation and poverty. The hop farms find even local breweries import cheaper crops from Poland, fruit from the damson orchards is no longer wanted to make the dye for khaki uniforms.</p> <p>The elderly have difficulty getting to nearby towns such as Tenbury Wells and Kidderminster to shop. The incomers from Birmingham and the black country are being made redundant.</p> <p>Does it mean that Mr Rumbold, who cannot possibly know all his flock, is an irrelevance? \"In a parish like this, it is still very much about being the parson as well as the vicar, about being a figure in the community to whom people come for advice and help even if they don't come to church.</p> <p>\"It's not about getting bums on seats. As a bishop once told me, I am called to be faithful, not to be successful.\"</p> <p>His declining congregations follow a nationwide pattern. The Bishop of Birmingham, Mark Santer, said: \"One has to be frank, the number of people on Sunday is declining and it is dispiriting if the numbers are small.\"</p> <p>Some claim this is partly due to the issues of women and homosexual clergy which have both preoccupied and split the church.</p> <p>When the Bishop of Blackburn, Alan Chesters, supported the repeal of Section 28 outlawing the promotion of homosexuality in schools, he was denounced by evangelicals for betraying the nation's children.</p> <p>A Synod lay member, Philip Gore, said: \"The bishop has capitulated to the gay lobby. The vast majority of parents are opposed to this sort of stuff and looked to the established church to provide firm opposition. We feel betrayed.\"</p> <p>Almost a decade after the first ordination of women priests, a recent survey found a quarter reporting they had experienced sexual harassment or abusive behaviour and 40% said congregations had walked out on them.</p> <p>Ironically, gay clergymen are blamed for some of the most spiteful attacks on their new female colleagues.The result has been that both groups regard each other with suspicion, rather than making common cause as oppressed minorities.</p> <p>The arrival of ordained women has also seen the departure of 400 of the church's leading Anglo-Catholic vicars and most vociferous lay people, such as the Tory MPs John Gummer and Ann Widdecombe, both of whom have taken refuge in Roman Catholicism.</p> <p><b> Fractious flock</b></p> <p>The church's leader, the Archbishop of Canterbury, is the focus of the most intense scrutiny. George Carey, appointed in 1991, is often compared to John Major - a social upstart subject to snobbish metropolitan sneers as he struggles to keep his fractious flock together and update the creaking mechanism of the institution.</p> <p>\"Actually, we're like the Labour party in the 1980s,\" one vicar said. \"We believe in letting it all hang out and pretend the vibrancy of our debate is a virtue.\"</p> <p>The church needs all the help it can get. The commissioners charged with looking after its money were found to have lost \u00a3500m through ill-advised property speculation in 1992, a crisis with profound effects on the church's burgeoning pensions bill and its organisation, which has led Dr Carey to adopt modern managerial methods to streamline the organisation and its decision-making.</p> <p>Paradoxically, some of the lessons of New Labour have been learned, though cack-handedly. Power has been increasingly centralised through the setting up of the inner cabinet-like archbishops' council, taking real decision-making away from the General Synod, the church's parliament.</p> <p>The church's press officers have also grown more spin doctor-like and aggressive in their promotion of the official line and rubbishing of anything that does not emanate from them.</p> <p>To much eye-rolling at its Westminster headquarters, Church House, it has even resorted to focus groups. The first, in February, told the church its services were too long and its vestments offputting.</p> <p>Its influence, too, in the life of the nation is declining. The government's reformed House of Lords will contain 10 fewer Anglican bishops - down to 16 - their places taken by representatives of other faiths.</p> <p>When Dr Carey and other bishops talk of disestablishment or the Prince of Wales says he wants to be Defender of Faiths, rather than just the Church of England, no one even turns a hair. \"I don't think it would be the end of the world,\" said Bishop Santer.</p> <p>Even some within its own ranks cannot see the church surviving. A survey by the Scripture Union estimates that if things continue at their present rate the church will be dead in 40 years, its buildings abandoned, its congregation down to just one in 200 of the population.</p> <p>Its author, Peter Brierley, is respected as the church's leading statistician but official spokesmen are already questioning his gloomy analysis, which is based on decline continuing along the same curve.</p> <p>Dr Brierley said: \"The basic doctrines of Christianity will be believed much less and there will be many who actively do not believe them. This is very sober stuff. Numbers of Christians will decrease and the ones who remain won't express their Christianity by going to church.\"</p> <p>Many of the church's 24,000 vicars are now being forced to radically reassess their roles.The Rev Adrian Newman, vicar of St Martin's-in-the-Bullring, Birmingham, sees himself almost as much as a chief executive and full-time social worker as a clergyman.</p> <p>\"Ten million people go past our door every year - it will be 22m when the new shopping centre opens - and we reckon 82,000 stop to come in,\" he said. \"We did a survey and estimate 10% of them have financial, emotional or psychological problems. That is a lot of people to help.\"</p> <p>Among its 20 staff, St Martin's employs a full-time clinical psychologist and an assistant psychologist as well as a curate, chaplain, arts coordinator, finance and development officer, secretaries, vergers and musicians.</p> <p>The stream of damaged people entering the church come even though most are not religious. They see the church as a place of help and advice, offering a meal, a listening and advisory service, a voucher for a bed in a hostel. But not necessarily, or even primarily, Christianity.</p> <p>\"We don't push the faith on them, but we make clear we will pray with them if they want. We don't jump on them or push them into a corner.</p> <p>\"They wouldn't come in if they thought they were going to be judged. We are not like the street preachers in the market every day - we just make sure we are here all the time.\"</p> <p><b> Monday: The rise of the evangelicals</b></p>",

For this he earns the standard clergy stipend of \u00a316,500, plus the use of his modern vicarage at the foot of the garden of the old Georgian rectory, which is owned by a millionaire. This is the pattern for many rural vicars these days - increasingly large parishes, filled with ancient, crumbling, even semi-derelict churches which remain a central part of England's heritage. \"I will probably be the last rector of north Teme. When I retire I'm sure they'll amalgamate the parish even more,\" said Mr Rumbold, pondering the possibility of parishes serving 10 or a dozen villages and churches. He has two 11th century churches, mystic, quiet places set among fields of sheep where people have worshipped for more than 1,000 years; one 18th century church built by a squire, and two churches built in the 19th century for congregations of miners and farmworkers. Each could hold several times the combined number of worshippers that now attend church in the valley each Sunday. Isolation and poverty Along the valley there is rural isolation and poverty. The hop farms find even local breweries import cheaper crops from Poland, fruit from the damson orchards is no longer wanted to make the dye for khaki uniforms. The elderly have difficulty getting to nearby towns such as Tenbury Wells and Kidderminster to shop. The incomers from Birmingham and the black country are being made redundant. Does it mean that Mr Rumbold, who cannot possibly know all his flock, is an irrelevance? \"In a parish like this, it is still very much about being the parson as well as the vicar, about being a figure in the community to whom people come for advice and help even if they don't come to church. \"It's not about getting bums on seats. As a bishop once told me, I am called to be faithful, not to be successful.\" His declining congregations follow a nationwide pattern. The Bishop of Birmingham, Mark Santer, said: \"One has to be frank, the number of people on Sunday is declining and it is dispiriting if the numbers are small.\" Some claim this is partly due to the issues of women and homosexual clergy which have both preoccupied and split the church. When the Bishop of Blackburn, Alan Chesters, supported the repeal of Section 28 outlawing the promotion of homosexuality in schools, he was denounced by evangelicals for betraying the nation's children. A Synod lay member, Philip Gore, said: \"The bishop has capitulated to the gay lobby. The vast majority of parents are opposed to this sort of stuff and looked to the established church to provide firm opposition. We feel betrayed.\" Almost a decade after the first ordination of women priests, a recent survey found a quarter reporting they had experienced sexual harassment or abusive behaviour and 40% said congregations had walked out on them. Ironically, gay clergymen are blamed for some of the most spiteful attacks on their new female colleagues.The result has been that both groups regard each other with suspicion, rather than making common cause as oppressed minorities. The arrival of ordained women has also seen the departure of 400 of the church's leading Anglo-Catholic vicars and most vociferous lay people, such as the Tory MPs John Gummer and Ann Widdecombe, both of whom have taken refuge in Roman Catholicism. Fractious flock The church's leader, the Archbishop of Canterbury, is the focus of the most intense scrutiny. George Carey, appointed in 1991, is often compared to John Major - a social upstart subject to snobbish metropolitan sneers as he struggles to keep his fractious flock together and update the creaking mechanism of the institution. \"Actually, we're like the Labour party in the 1980s,\" one vicar said. \"We believe in letting it all hang out and pretend the vibrancy of our debate is a virtue.\" The church needs all the help it can get. The commissioners charged with looking after its money were found to have lost \u00a3500m through ill-advised property speculation in 1992, a crisis with profound effects on the church's burgeoning pensions bill and its organisation, which has led Dr Carey to adopt modern managerial methods to streamline the organisation and its decision-making. Paradoxically, some of the lessons of New Labour have been learned, though cack-handedly. Power has been increasingly centralised through the setting up of the inner cabinet-like archbishops' council, taking real decision-making away from the General Synod, the church's parliament. The church's press officers have also grown more spin doctor-like and aggressive in their promotion of the official line and rubbishing of anything that does not emanate from them. To much eye-rolling at its Westminster headquarters, Church House, it has even resorted to focus groups. The first, in February, told the church its services were too long and its vestments offputting. Its influence, too, in the life of the nation is declining. The government's reformed House of Lords will contain 10 fewer Anglican bishops - down to 16 - their places taken by representatives of other faiths. When Dr Carey and other bishops talk of disestablishment or the Prince of Wales says he wants to be Defender of Faiths, rather than just the Church of England, no one even turns a hair. \"I don't think it would be the end of the world,\" said Bishop Santer. Even some within its own ranks cannot see the church surviving. A survey by the Scripture Union estimates that if things continue at their present rate the church will be dead in 40 years, its buildings abandoned, its congregation down to just one in 200 of the population. Its author, Peter Brierley, is respected as the church's leading statistician but official spokesmen are already questioning his gloomy analysis, which is based on decline continuing along the same curve. Dr Brierley said: \"The basic doctrines of Christianity will be believed much less and there will be many who actively do not believe them. This is very sober stuff. Numbers of Christians will decrease and the ones who remain won't express their Christianity by going to church.\" Many of the church's 24,000 vicars are now being forced to radically reassess their roles.The Rev Adrian Newman, vicar of St Martin's-in-the-Bullring, Birmingham, sees himself almost as much as a chief executive and full-time social worker as a clergyman. \"Ten million people go past our door every year - it will be 22m when the new shopping centre opens - and we reckon 82,000 stop to come in,\" he said. \"We did a survey and estimate 10% of them have financial, emotional or psychological problems. That is a lot of people to help.\" Among its 20 staff, St Martin's employs a full-time clinical psychologist and an assistant psychologist as well as a curate, chaplain, arts coordinator, finance and development officer, secretaries, vergers and musicians. The stream of damaged people entering the church come even though most are not religious. They see the church as a place of help and advice, offering a meal, a listening and advisory service, a voucher for a bed in a hostel. But not necessarily, or even primarily, Christianity. \"We don't push the faith on them, but we make clear we will pray with them if they want. We don't jump on them or push them into a corner. \"They wouldn't come in if they thought they were going to be judged. We are not like the street preachers in the market every day - we just make sure we are here all the time.\" Monday: The rise of the evangelicals",

      "body": "<p>William Hague's latest swing to the right will win him enough seats at next month's local elections and the general election to consolidate his position as opposition leader, leftwing Conservative MPs are starting to predict.</p> <p>Not only are they resigned to Mr Hague leading them into an election they are doomed to lose in mid-2001, they fear that a post-election leadership challenge might trigger the ultimate nightmare for the Tory left: a second round contest between Michael Portillo and Ann Widdecombe which the shadow home secretary wins.</p> <p>Senior Tories yesterday put a brave face on claims that party membership, now around 350,000, is at its lowest since the first world war, insisting that it is stable or rising - though nowhere near the \"millennium 1m\" Mr Hague spoke of after he succeeded John Major in 1997.</p> <p>That was the figure in Margaret Thatcher's heyday. But the Tory problem is less numbers than age profile. Their membership is still ageing.</p> <p>\"We never kept national membership records until just over a year ago,\" the Tory deputy chairman, David Prior, said yesterday as grassroots radicals complained that the party is still too undemocratic to attract young people.</p> <p>Mr Prior insisted: \"Each Conservative association kept their own records. We now do have an accurate membership list and it is growing. All political parties are finding it difficult to attract new members, but we have, I think, turned the corner.\"</p> <p>Mr Hague has been fighting hard in recent weeks to ensure that he can claim another \"victory\" in a series of elections on May 4, just as he did by shifting his Euro-rhetoric to the right during the 1999 European parliament elections, where PR voting and a very low 23% turnout proved a recipe for Tory gains.</p> <p>If Mr Hague had not passed that test, some party plotters already had the names of 25 MPs prepared to trigger a leadership contest under Hague-imposed rules, Tory insiders admitted last week.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats in Romsey, Hampshire, are so confident that they may just snatch victory in the May 4 byelection to pick a successor to Michael Colvin - burned to death in a fire at his home - that some senior Lib Dems are predicting \"an anti-gay smear story\" between now and polling day.</p> <p>Conservative strategists are confident they will win and argue that their concerns on Europe - Mr Hague staged a \"Save the \u00a3\" rally in Romsey - on asylum seekers and the section 28 controversy on sex education reflect mounting concerns among voters.</p> <p>A win for the Tory candidate, Tim Palmer, and a victory for Ken Livingstone as independent mayor of London, would be judged a good day's work. That should be enough to give Mr Hague some morale-boosting lines as he urges his troops towards a general election he has no chance of winning, according to Tory campaign data leaked last week.</p> <p>But leftwing Tories, who believe their leader made a mistake in abandoning the more \"inclusive\" rhetoric of his first year in favour of consolidating his party's core vote, are already looking beyond that defeat.</p> <p>Others on the moderate flank believe that Mr Portillo \"is not behaving like a man who wants to be chancellor\".</p> <p>What they would like to see is Mr Clarke making one last bid if Mr Hague is dispatched after the 2001 defeat, failing that a run by Mr Ancram or by Sir Malcolm Rifkind, if the former foreign secretary gets back to Westminster.</p> <p>In reality some of them are already adjusting to the prospect of a Portillo leadership, not least because he is meeting them halfway on key social policy issues.</p> <p>The rules laid down by Mr Hague require a leader to stand down if they fail to win the support of half of party's MPs. But once MPs have voted to reduce applicants for the vacancy to two finalists, the rank and file make the choice.</p>",

      "bodyText": "William Hague's latest swing to the right will win him enough seats at next month's local elections and the general election to consolidate his position as opposition leader, leftwing Conservative MPs are starting to predict. Not only are they resigned to Mr Hague leading them into an election they are doomed to lose in mid-2001, they fear that a post-election leadership challenge might trigger the ultimate nightmare for the Tory left: a second round contest between Michael Portillo and Ann Widdecombe which the shadow home secretary wins. Senior Tories yesterday put a brave face on claims that party membership, now around 350,000, is at its lowest since the first world war, insisting that it is stable or rising - though nowhere near the \"millennium 1m\" Mr Hague spoke of after he succeeded John Major in 1997. That was the figure in Margaret Thatcher's heyday. But the Tory problem is less numbers than age profile. Their membership is still ageing. \"We never kept national membership records until just over a year ago,\" the Tory deputy chairman, David Prior, said yesterday as grassroots radicals complained that the party is still too undemocratic to attract young people. Mr Prior insisted: \"Each Conservative association kept their own records. We now do have an accurate membership list and it is growing. All political parties are finding it difficult to attract new members, but we have, I think, turned the corner.\" Mr Hague has been fighting hard in recent weeks to ensure that he can claim another \"victory\" in a series of elections on May 4, just as he did by shifting his Euro-rhetoric to the right during the 1999 European parliament elections, where PR voting and a very low 23% turnout proved a recipe for Tory gains. If Mr Hague had not passed that test, some party plotters already had the names of 25 MPs prepared to trigger a leadership contest under Hague-imposed rules, Tory insiders admitted last week. Liberal Democrats in Romsey, Hampshire, are so confident that they may just snatch victory in the May 4 byelection to pick a successor to Michael Colvin - burned to death in a fire at his home - that some senior Lib Dems are predicting \"an anti-gay smear story\" between now and polling day. Conservative strategists are confident they will win and argue that their concerns on Europe - Mr Hague staged a \"Save the \u00a3\" rally in Romsey - on asylum seekers and the section 28 controversy on sex education reflect mounting concerns among voters. A win for the Tory candidate, Tim Palmer, and a victory for Ken Livingstone as independent mayor of London, would be judged a good day's work. That should be enough to give Mr Hague some morale-boosting lines as he urges his troops towards a general election he has no chance of winning, according to Tory campaign data leaked last week. But leftwing Tories, who believe their leader made a mistake in abandoning the more \"inclusive\" rhetoric of his first year in favour of consolidating his party's core vote, are already looking beyond that defeat. Others on the moderate flank believe that Mr Portillo \"is not behaving like a man who wants to be chancellor\". What they would like to see is Mr Clarke making one last bid if Mr Hague is dispatched after the 2001 defeat, failing that a run by Mr Ancram or by Sir Malcolm Rifkind, if the former foreign secretary gets back to Westminster. In reality some of them are already adjusting to the prospect of a Portillo leadership, not least because he is meeting them halfway on key social policy issues. The rules laid down by Mr Hague require a leader to stand down if they fail to win the support of half of party's MPs. But once MPs have voted to reduce applicants for the vacancy to two finalists, the rank and file make the choice.",

Mr Amato, a former prime minister known as \"Dr Subtle\" for his discretion, was chosen by colleagues as the best bet to unite the fractious coalition for a confidence vote in parliament next week. President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was last night expected to accept the nomination despite furious protests from Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right opposition, which wants an election a year early. Mr Amato, 61, fills a vacuum left by Massimo D'Alema, who quit as prime minister on Wednesday following a crushing defeat in regional elections. Mr Amato will spend the weekend selecting cabinet ministers and trying to shore up the centre-left's razor-thin majority to form Italy's 58th government since the second world war. Most estimates put his support at 322 votes in the 630-member house. The technocrat, respected but unloved for spending cuts, was accepted by suspicious leftwing colleagues as the price to be paid for buying another year in government. Some members suggested yesterday that the new leader was a stop-gap who should step down within the year, a refrain which also dogged Mr D'Alema. Mr Amato will also be plagued by the accusation that he has no democratic mandate. Political analysts have warned that the coalition will be weak; it certainly will need to regroup before taking on an opposition which swept the north and key regions in the south with anti-immigration rhetoric in regional elections last weekend. Avoiding an election also keeps alive a May 21 referendum on electoral reform to end chronic political instability in the country by abolishing the remnants of proportional representation in favour of a first-past-the-post system. Determination to see the referendum passed deterred President Ciampi from dissolving parliament and calling an election, which infuriated Mr Berlusconi who opposes the referendum and wants to exploit his momentum. His coalition of former neo-fascists and the autonomy-seeking Northern League scored more than 50% of the vote in the regional elections. In his brief stint as prime minister in 1994, Mr Berlusconi praised Mr Amato as a potential ally; yesterday he branded him a \"useful idiot\".

Thither we went. The sun shone and we were lazy. Coleridge pitched upon several places to sit down, but we could not be all of one mind respecting sun and shade, so we pushed on to the foot of the scar.\"</p> <p>Poems 1960-2000, by Fleur Adcock, is published by Bloodaxe.</p> <p><b>The Vale of Grasmere</b><br>These coloured slopes ought to inspire, <br>as much as anything, discretion: <br>think of the egotisms laid bare, <br>the shy campaigns of self-projection <br>tricked out as visits to Dove Cottage <br>tellingly rendered.

Fleur Adcock is well qualified for the job: more than 20 years ago she published a pamphlet of verse written during an 11-month stay as literary fellow at Charlotte Mason college in Ambleside. \"I was grudgingly given an unpaid year off from my job at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,\" she said. \"A lot of people there seemed then to talk about Wordsworth as if he had died only last week.\" Born in New Zealand, Ms Adcock had previously spent only one weekend in the Lake District but during it discovered \"the lost England of my childhood\". \"To me it was an unpolluted landscape, and I thought I had to try to get back there. So when this fellowship came up, I saw my opportunity. \"I read a lot of Wordsworth's work, including The Prelude, and I used to sleep with Dorothy's journals by my bedside. When I got to the end, I went back to the beginning.\" Poems written during that stay are included in her new book, out next Thursday, which gathers verse produced over the past 40 years. They describe how she went for walks, gazed out over Windermere and tried to come to terms with the landscape's presiding genius. In The Spirit of the Place, she finishes a walk at dusk and hears dogs barking hysterically \"and from the housing estate below/a deep mad voice bellows 'Wordsworth! Wordsworth!'\". In the Vale of Grasmere she writes ironically of poets on pilgrimage and adds: \"Most of the rocks are wreathed by now/with faded rags of fluttering soul\". Ms Adcock will read those poems at tomorrow's ceremony, plus others by Wordsworth including lines writtens in 1802 about his pursuit of a butterfly. He describes himself as a hunter tracking his prey, but Dorothy \"God love her, feared to brush/The dust from off its wings\". Ms Adcock will also read The Glow-worm (1807), which Dorothy recorded reciting to herself as she went for a walk on Good Friday 1802. \"I wanted to include something by Dorothy herself and hoped I could find a passage from her journals for April 23, 1800,\" she said. \"But there is nothing for that day, so I'll read from her entry for the same day in 1802.\" Dorothy describes a walk with William and Samuel Taylor Coleridge towards Rydal. \"Before we got to Tom Dawson's, we determined to go un der Nab Scar. Thither we went. The sun shone and we were lazy. Coleridge pitched upon several places to sit down, but we could not be all of one mind respecting sun and shade, so we pushed on to the foot of the scar.\" Poems 1960-2000, by Fleur Adcock, is published by Bloodaxe. The Vale of Grasmere These coloured slopes ought to inspire, as much as anything, discretion: think of the egotisms laid bare, the shy campaigns of self-projection tricked out as visits to Dove Cottage tellingly rendered. Every year some poet comes on pilgrimage along these valleys. Read his verses: each bud of delicate perception sprouts from a blossoming neurosis too well watered by Grasmere - in which he sees his own reflection. He sits beside a tarn or ghyll sensitively eating chocolate and eyes Helm Crag or Rydal Fell plotting some novel way to use it. Most of the rocks are wreathed by now with faded rags of fluttering soul. But the body finds another function for crags and fells, as Wordsworth knew himself: they offer hands and feet their own creative works to do. \"I climb because I can't write\" one honest man said. Better so. Fleur Adcock",

Diarmuid Brennan, the IRA army council's head of civilian intelligence, later wrote to the poet laureate, who had been a spy in wartime Ireland, telling him how he had been spared. \"I came to the conclusion that a man who could give such pleasure with his pen couldn't be much of a secret agent. I may well be wrong,\" said Brennan. He was very wrong. For newly discovered papers reveal that behind his bumbling tweedy front, Betjeman was an exceedingly good spy. He in fact knew more about the inner workings of the IRA than many of its own members, and his take on Eamon de Valera's neutral Irish government was far more accurate and astute than that of his political masters. Betjeman worked as a press attache in the British embassy in Dublin in the early years of the war planting British propaganda in newspapers and trying to counter the energetic efforts of his German opposite number, a man called Petersen. But it was as a spy and political analyst with an understanding of De Valera's often convoluted attempts to maintain Irish neutrality, in the face of intense pressure from Churchill to join the allies, that Betjeman really shone. His success eventually attracted the attention of IRA, which Betjeman had correctly deduced was more anti-De Valera than anti-British at the time because he had interned most their leaders without trial. Brennan later wrote to the poet telling him how in 1941 two gunmen from the second battalion of the Dublin IRA had approached him looking for a photograph of \"a fellow called Betjeman. \"These second battalion types were known to us as the Edward-Gees of the IRA, after Edward G Robinson [the actor who specialised in playing gangsters]. \"I got communications describing you as 'dangerous' and a person of menace to all of us.

In a neat historical irony, Mansergh's son, Michael, is now the Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern's historical adviser, and is credited with helping to persuade the Irish government to renounce its territorial claim to Northern Ireland. Heresy According to documents unearthed by a Channel 4 documentary to be shown tomorrow, Betjeman actually told London that the only way to lure the Irish into the war was to end partition. He said a \"defensive union of the whole of Ireland\" should be made \"indissoluble\", and he urged them to stop attacking the Irish Free State. This was heresy at the time given that De Valera was seen by Churchill as little short of a traitor, and had become a hate figure in the British press. Betjeman recommended \"the stopping of anti-Irish articles and cartoons\". Instead, propaganda should concentrate on backing De Valera \"and showing the tightrope he is walking\". Although De Valera was convinced Germany would win the war, the poet said: \"There is no doubt that he and most of his ministers feel that the better interests of Eire will best be served by a British victory. For this reason Mr de Valera is Britain's best friend in Ireland.\" He was also scathing about Unionist leaders of the devolved Northern Ireland government and their \"stupid anti-Irish remarks\". His reports hint at several high-level contacts within the Irish government. That the English poet appeared to have struck up a very useful friendship with the minister for industry, Sean McEntee, among others, and his IRA informants was even more impressive. His estimates of their strength and his accounts of their interminable internal feuds were very close to the mark. The depth and detail of his intelligence on their splits and activities point to the inside track, according to Michael O'Riordan, a Spanish civil war veteran active in the IRA at the time. Betjeman somehow got hold of a hand written anti-fascist declaration signed by 140 leftwing IRA men, including O'Riordan, interned in the Curragh army camp in Kildare and reported it back to London complete with precise figures about how many prisoners were communist, pro-German and anti-British. Although he was clearly no stranger to espionage, one of Betjeman's main sources of information were the wags and Irish Times journalists who gathered in the Palace bar, a Dublin watering hole where Brendan Behan - then in the IRA himself - sometimes held court and which the great satirist and novelist Flann O'Brien used like an office. Tony Gray, an Irish Times journalist who met him then, said Betjeman was a very popular figure who endeared himself to the Irish. \"He was very witty and very English and people loved him. He didn't at all seem to be a spy, which I suppose is a very good cover.\" He got even more popular by persuading Laurence Olivier to shoot his ultra-patriotic Henry V - with its heavily symbolism of a beleaguered England vastly outnumbered by its European enemies - in Ireland. The doughty yeomen who faced the French in the Agincourt battle scenes were actually Irish farmers, paid extra if they brought their own horse. \"That was a huge propaganda coup,\" said Marion Milne, who directed the documentary. \"The man was a consummate operator. Not only did it pump \u00a380,000 into the Irish economy - a huge amount at the time - it won the British cause a lot of sympathy and goodwill.\" As you would expect from a man who found hitherto unknown levels in light verse, Betjeman's dispatches back to his controller in London were often priceless. Weighing up the threat of a German invasion of England being launched from Ireland, he noted that Dublin pork butchers were almost all German and that the Irish army bandmaster was also one. His insights into the Irish psyche were spot on. \"The Irish are not at all ideological,\" he wrote in 1941, \"and not really interested in totalitarianism versus democracy. They are, however, intensely interested in Irishmen.\" And in a final flourish he signed himself Sean O'Betjeman in Gaelic script.

      "bodyText": "A group of 280 ex-servicemen are suing the Ministry of Defence in the largest group action of its kind to seek compensation for post-traumatic stress disorder. The veterans, who between them have served in almost every recent military action involving British forces - including Bosnia, the Gulf, the Falkands and in Northern Ireland - claim the MoD failed to diagnose and treat those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The men say they were poorly trained for the effects of conflict, exposed to unnecessary danger and that afterwards the ministry failed to diagnose or treat their condition or to put adequate support systems in place. The claimants include 40 Welsh Guardsmen who were trapped in the burning shell of the Sir Galahad warship after it was attacked by Argentine planes during the Falklands war. Many of the survivors of that attack say they have since been unable to work as result of the psychological stress they suffered and some claim not to have had a full night's sleep since the attack in which 50 of their comrades died. The 280 individual claims are to be brought in the High Court in two group actions next year, claiming medical negligence and seeking compensation for loss of earnings. If these cases are successful, the government could face compensation claims from thousands more ex-servicemen totalling hundreds of millions of pounds. John Mackenzie, a solicitor representing 50 of the claimants, said PTSD was a \"deeply disabling\" condition that had left many of the veterans emotionally scarred. He told Radio 4's Today programme: \"The basis of the action is that the MoD and services should have taken better steps to diagnose and treat the condition once they had acquired it. \"It is a condition that has been recognised in one form or another since the First World War, and probably before that.\" The lawyer warned that the litigation could also have implications for emergency services whose employees face similar stresses. Although the ex-servicemen's claims acknowledge that soldiers, sailors and airmen must accept being exposed to risk and danger during conflict, they are claiming the right to receive treatment for any resulting psychological problems in the same way as they would expect for physical injuries. The MoD is expected to argue that it could not have predicted the problems as PTSD was little known until recently and was only recognised by the American Psychiatric Society in 1980. Although 150 people were discharged from the forces for PTSD between1990 and 1998, there is still no single diagnostic test for the disorder, sufferers of which exhibit a range of physical and mental symptoms, including headaches, nightmares, an inability to concentrate and involuntary tics. Shaun Rusling, chairman of the National Gulf Veterans and Families Association, said the MoD promised to put a system of diagnosis and treatment in place after the Falklands. He said: \"At the time that the troops were returning from the Gulf war in 1991, the MoD failed to keep that promise. \"The result of this failure led to an increase in serving soldiers and ex-servicemen committing suicide and a clear increase in the divorce rate in service families.\" The British veterans claim that evidence collected by the Israeli authorities during the Six Day War in 1967 and the experience of American serviceman in Vietnam proved decades ago that servicemen can suffer PTSD as a result of their involvement in military action - yet the MoD did little to alleviate the suffering. Israel, unlike Britain, has routinely screened and treated troops for PTSD since the 1970s. An MoD spokesman insisted the ministry had behaved \"in line with contemporary best practice in our treatment of service personnel with suspected PTSD\". He added: \"We hope that the court's findings on these lead cases will set the scene for the resolution of the remainder of the outstanding claims. We have had measures in place to prevent stress related illness for a number of years. \"We take it very seriously. We are more sophisticated now than when the shell-shock victims of the Second World War were identified.\" Bill Sutherland's nightmares began soon after the first bombs hit HMS Plymouth on June 8 1982 . A chief petty officer in the Royal Navy, he was serving in the Falklands when the ship was attacked, suffering fire and bomb damage. That day changed his life forever. \"I started having disturbed sleep and nightmares, waking with cold sweats, and my personality completely changed.\" Mr Sutherland, now 42 and living in Fife, saw action in the Gulf clearing mines off Kuwait in 1991, but he was not diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder until 1995. As the officer in charge of his ship's fire party, he was asked to take his men to the fire training ground. \"It was absolute terror,\" he says. \"I soiled myself and burst into tears. I had this terrible fear of getting trapped in a fire.\" He spent a month in hospital and, after 21 years of service, he was medically discharged in May 1996. He blames his divorce on the condition, while his fear of crowds means he has only worked for six months since. \"I lost my wife because I wasn't the same person she married. If something had been said or done earlier, my life would be different now.\"",

      "body": "<p>When Harrison Birtwistle decides to call a theatre work The Last Supper, the last thing you would expect is a straight narration of the biblical events. Storytelling has never been the point of his theatre pieces, and in the \"dramatic tableaux\" unveiled on Tuesday at the Berlin Staatsoper, the events of the Passion are just the starting point. The piece is more concerned with exploring the dramatic possibilities of the rituals it implies than with delivering a commentary on its religious significance. In the same way, the priority in Birtwistle's 1984 The Mask of Orpheus was to examine the many facets of the myth rather than to tell the story of Orpheus and Eurydice pure and simple. </p> <p>Robin Blaser has provided a libretto for The Last Supper that is both passionate and allusive, threaded through with theological references and some overripe imagery. The final message of his text is hard to pin down, and the ending, with the sound of a cock crowing, is perhaps deliberately ambiguous - would Christ be betrayed in the 21st century in just the way he was in the first, and who would play Judas this time around? The score, on the other hand, contains some of the most direct and immediate writing for voices and orchestra that Birtwistle has ever produced. The one thing that The Last Supper most decisively is not is a Christian celebration for Easter, despite the timing of the premiere. </p> <p>The main action of The Last Supper takes place now, looking back \"through the three zeros of the year 2000\", as Blaser has one of the disciples say. The only female protagonist, a figure called Ghost, acts as the bridge between the past and the present. While a chorus in the pit comments and proclaims, she gathers the disciples - minus Judas - together once again, to relive the events of that fateful evening, and to take stock of the intervening 2,000 years. Each disciple gives a little vignette of his subsequent life, then they celebrate their reunion and build a table on which to re-enact their meal. When Judas finally appears to complete the group the mood darkens and becomes confrontational. </p> <p>Christ's arrival is delayed until the second half of the work, and the mood then changes yet again as he renews his message. Around him history seems about to repeat itself, and he suggests, perhaps rather glibly, that a new Christianity can learn from the mistakes of the old. </p> <p>It is Christ's appearance that also triggers the first of three \"visions\" which break the continuity of the second half of the work. Each time, the stage darkens, and to the sound of a pre-recorded chorus singing some of the most intense and rapturously beautiful music Birtwistle has ever written, the betrayal, the stations of the cross and the crucifixion are acted out in reverse order. In Martin Duncan's intelligent and effectively low-key production, with designs by Alison Chitty, these visions are played out in cliched, garishly realistic, biblical imagery, pointing up the contrast with the everyday clothes of the disciples, who are summoned back into the world through a brilliantly lit \"time tunnel\" into an impersonal, concrete space. </p> <p>Birtwistle writes for a small orchestra - 35 players, with a minimum of percussion, but with an accordion that adds an astringent edge to the textures. The words from the soloists, sometimes set in sweeping melismas, sometimes incisively declaimed, come across very clearly. They are underpinned with long raking melodic lines or intricate webs of counterpoint, so that each of the disciples as well as Christ and Ghost can inhabit their own specific musical worlds. </p> <p>The two-hour work unfolds in a seamless arc - what will audiences at Glyndebourne do about their own supper? - and is perhaps a little too long. The pacing of the first half, up until the appearance of Christ in fact, is perfect - intensely dramatic, gripping, exuberant. The disciples celebrate their return by dancing and clapping to some of Birtwistle's most unbuttoned music, while their questioning of Judas - \"Who do you think He is?\" - and the riddle with which he retaliates, create music drama of real power. </p> <p>After that, though, the pace sometimes slackens; the long, very typically Birtwistlian section in which Christ washes the feet of each of his disciples, ridding them of the dust of 2,000 years of inhumanity, is a cyclic, too protracted structure. At the same time, Christ's own utterances finally lack the authority that the context seems to demand of them. </p> <p>That might have had something to do with William Dazeley's performance in that role - his cream-suited portrayal (with an unfortunate resemblance to Monty Python's Brian) didn't project real confidence and charisma, though it might well be fleshed out when the production reaches Glyndebourne, first on the tour in the autumn and then in next summer's festival.

      "bodyText": "When Harrison Birtwistle decides to call a theatre work The Last Supper, the last thing you would expect is a straight narration of the biblical events. Storytelling has never been the point of his theatre pieces, and in the \"dramatic tableaux\" unveiled on Tuesday at the Berlin Staatsoper, the events of the Passion are just the starting point. The piece is more concerned with exploring the dramatic possibilities of the rituals it implies than with delivering a commentary on its religious significance. In the same way, the priority in Birtwistle's 1984 The Mask of Orpheus was to examine the many facets of the myth rather than to tell the story of Orpheus and Eurydice pure and simple. Robin Blaser has provided a libretto for The Last Supper that is both passionate and allusive, threaded through with theological references and some overripe imagery. The final message of his text is hard to pin down, and the ending, with the sound of a cock crowing, is perhaps deliberately ambiguous - would Christ be betrayed in the 21st century in just the way he was in the first, and who would play Judas this time around? The score, on the other hand, contains some of the most direct and immediate writing for voices and orchestra that Birtwistle has ever produced. The one thing that The Last Supper most decisively is not is a Christian celebration for Easter, despite the timing of the premiere. The main action of The Last Supper takes place now, looking back \"through the three zeros of the year 2000\", as Blaser has one of the disciples say. The only female protagonist, a figure called Ghost, acts as the bridge between the past and the present. While a chorus in the pit comments and proclaims, she gathers the disciples - minus Judas - together once again, to relive the events of that fateful evening, and to take stock of the intervening 2,000 years. Each disciple gives a little vignette of his subsequent life, then they celebrate their reunion and build a table on which to re-enact their meal. When Judas finally appears to complete the group the mood darkens and becomes confrontational. Christ's arrival is delayed until the second half of the work, and the mood then changes yet again as he renews his message. Around him history seems about to repeat itself, and he suggests, perhaps rather glibly, that a new Christianity can learn from the mistakes of the old. It is Christ's appearance that also triggers the first of three \"visions\" which break the continuity of the second half of the work. Each time, the stage darkens, and to the sound of a pre-recorded chorus singing some of the most intense and rapturously beautiful music Birtwistle has ever written, the betrayal, the stations of the cross and the crucifixion are acted out in reverse order. In Martin Duncan's intelligent and effectively low-key production, with designs by Alison Chitty, these visions are played out in cliched, garishly realistic, biblical imagery, pointing up the contrast with the everyday clothes of the disciples, who are summoned back into the world through a brilliantly lit \"time tunnel\" into an impersonal, concrete space. Birtwistle writes for a small orchestra - 35 players, with a minimum of percussion, but with an accordion that adds an astringent edge to the textures. The words from the soloists, sometimes set in sweeping melismas, sometimes incisively declaimed, come across very clearly. They are underpinned with long raking melodic lines or intricate webs of counterpoint, so that each of the disciples as well as Christ and Ghost can inhabit their own specific musical worlds. The two-hour work unfolds in a seamless arc - what will audiences at Glyndebourne do about their own supper? - and is perhaps a little too long. The pacing of the first half, up until the appearance of Christ in fact, is perfect - intensely dramatic, gripping, exuberant. The disciples celebrate their return by dancing and clapping to some of Birtwistle's most unbuttoned music, while their questioning of Judas - \"Who do you think He is?\" - and the riddle with which he retaliates, create music drama of real power. After that, though, the pace sometimes slackens; the long, very typically Birtwistlian section in which Christ washes the feet of each of his disciples, ridding them of the dust of 2,000 years of inhumanity, is a cyclic, too protracted structure. At the same time, Christ's own utterances finally lack the authority that the context seems to demand of them. That might have had something to do with William Dazeley's performance in that role - his cream-suited portrayal (with an unfortunate resemblance to Monty Python's Brian) didn't project real confidence and charisma, though it might well be fleshed out when the production reaches Glyndebourne, first on the tour in the autumn and then in next summer's festival. (Glyndebourne, along with London's South Bank Centre, are co-commissioners of the work.) The rest of the cast is already superb. Susan Bickley as Ghost and Thomas Randle as Judas are outstanding. She is the pivot around which the whole work revolves, its conscience and its emotional heart; he is its dark side, hunted, remorseful, and strangely compelling. Daniel Barenboim conducted the first performance wonderfully; it was he who secured the premiere for Berlin, and his faith has been repaid with a fascinating work. \u0095 Glyndebourne Touring Opera will give the British premiere of The Last Supper at Glyndebourne on October 18.",

      "body": "<p>It is given to few journalists, even from the Guardian, to interview the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ before lunch, but as we sat in a Bavarian cafe supping cappuccinos, it did not seem ridiculous. This is Oberammergau, home of the famous passion play and scene of continuing controversy over the blaming of Jews for the crucifixion of Christ. Once again, charges of anti-semitism are reverberating through the Alps. </p> <p>Outside the vast 4,700-seat theatre, you can watch hundreds of villagers reverently converging through a spring dusk. Heavily-bearded middle-aged farmers, businessmen, wood carvers, some wearing traditional hats, others driving up in BMWs, families in anoraks, young women in leather jackets, all congregating, as their ancestors have done for 360 years, to take part in a ritual that once every 10 years makes their village unique. </p> <p>The play, performed only by villagers (you have to have been born locally or have lived here for at least 20 years) will this summer attract half a million visitors: the production has as many as 1,000 actors on stage, lasts for nine hours and is performed almost entirely in German. As 60% of the audience will be tourists from the US and Britain, many will have little idea of what is being said: they do not seem to care. The 112 performances, up to five times a week between May and October, were sold out two years ago. </p> <p>The words do matter, however. After decades of argument, this year the play has been substantially rewritten in an attempt to be sensitive to long-standing Jewish complaints. But the rewrite has not satisfied Jewish-American groups. With only weeks before the first public performance, the New York-based Anti-Defamation League is demanding further script revisions to make clear that the high priests who condemned Christ were not bad just because they were Jewish. </p> <p>The name of Judas is too close to Judaism; the word Pharisee is fraught with meaning; couldn't Oberammergau just put on Godspell instead, asks the League. It suggests that visitors should be reminded that the village is close to Dachau - the concentration camp site is almost 100 miles away. The mostly Catholic villagers resent that the changes they have made have not been appreciated. They do not like one Jewish critic's description of them as living in \"the jungle of Bavaria\". And the Jews feel that the villagers have ignored Germany's past. </p> <p>\"Sometimes I do believe they will not be satisfied until Jesus dies of influenza,\" sighs Otto Huber, a teacher who has rewritten the play. \"We have a friendly, threatening relationship. With Dachau nearby, one should be more careful,\" says Rabbi Leon Klenicki from his League office in New York. </p> <p> The play is close to the hearts of 5,000 villagers. It has been performed every decade since their ancestors swore in the church in 1634 that they would stage it regularly if God spared them from the plague; 83 villagers died that summer but after the oath, as winter approached, there were no more deaths. The village has kept its promise. Its inhabitants used to perform only for themselves, but for the last 130 years productions have been popular with visitors. In the early 1900s, the auditorium, dominating the village, was built to accommodate growing audiences. In 1934, Hitler was among them; he claimed the play was a precious tool of anti-semitism. Only in the last 10 years have things begun to change, slowly. Otto Huber and younger colleagues, now in control of the play, do acknowledge there was a problem, perhaps less with the current text (written by the parish priest Alois Daisenberger in the 1860s) than with its interpretation. Somehow in the late 19th century, a choral aria asking what God should do with sinners - implicitly Jews - concluded that they should be killed; it dropped Daisenberger's conciliatory lines,that it was God's purpose to rescue them. </p> <p>Now pointed references to bad characters being Jewish, suggestions that the money-changers and the high priest Caiaphas, Christ's accusers, were motivated by their religion, have gone, as has the suggestion that Pontius Pilate was a good man facing Jewish pressure. . Out has gone Judas's yellow costume, with its echo of the colour of the stars Jews were forced to wear under the Nazis. </p> <p>In have come references to Jesus's own Jewishness (the last supper will be a Passover feast with Christ reciting a Hebrew prayer); a change in the character of Pilate, who takes a cynically ruthless decision to order the execution; above all, new lines imply that those opposing Jesus are motivated by human wickedness, not Judaism. </p> <p>These changes have taken time and effort. Ten years ago, Huber and the play's director, Christian St\u00fcckl, were defeated in a village referendum over revising the text (all decisions about the play are put to referendum). The revolutionary proposal that women who were married or over 35 should be allowed to take part was only reluctantly accepted, even though it ended the absurd convention that Jesus's mother should be played by a woman decades younger than the actor playing Christ. Other conventions - that the cast do not wear make-up (the men stop shaving a year before the show to achieve the requisite shagginess) and that no microphones are used, despite the huge auditorium - were left unchanged. This year, one of two women playing Mary, Andrea Hecht, 37, who runs a local art shop, is married with two children. The two men who take it in turn to play her son are both younger than she is, though only by a few years. </p> <p> The theatre has been renovated at a cost of \u00a35m to seat almost 5,000 people. In a cafe opposite, Hecht and Anton Burckhart, 29, a forestry worker who plays one of the Christs, explained the village's motivation to keep the play alive. It brings enormous revenue to the region since most visitors have to stay two nights to see it. But the cast themselves do not reap financial rewards. </p> <p>\"We would do this even if nobody came. It is a very important part of our life,\" said Hecht, who will work in her shop even on performance days, during the long periods when she is not required on stage. \"This is important to the village and its unity. We are not professional actors, so normal life must go on. It would be dangerous if I started feeling holy. I believe in God but I don't go to church every week.\" </p> <p>Burckhart, a man with a hint of G\u00e9rard Depardieu about him, said: \"No Oberammergau actor has ever become a professional. I don't want to be famous; when this is over, I will go back to the forest.\" </p> <p>Oberammergau is not a devout village. Only about 7% of locals regularly attend church. But attitudes are deeply conservative. Huber and St\u00fcckl, both from local families - Huber's has been there since 1670 - had to present their proposed revisions every three months to the town council and village meetings before they were accepted. Critics are at present silent, though one local has said the play is no longer pious enough. Some tickets, mainly those sold in Germany, are being returned. </p> <p> \"I think if you asked people in our audience whether Jesus was a Jew, they might be genuinely shocked,\" said Huber. St\u00fcckl, a professional director, whose father and grandfather are in the cast, said: \"My actors are very good, but it is not possible to make great theatre, because many people who come here want to see the old story.\" </p> <p>But, like the rest of Germany, Oberammergau is changing. On the way to the theatre, the director chatted with a shell-suited skateboarder. \"He is the first Muslim ever to be in the play,\" St\u00fcckl said. </p> <p>The revisions did not impress the Anti-Defamation League, which last week sent Huber nine further pages of changes it wants to see. While conceding the new script was a great improvement, Rabbi Klenicki said that passion plays are sources of anti-Judaism and do not improve the relationship between Christians and Jews; the play still projects a very negative view of Jewish leadership in the first century, implying community guilt and minimising Roman responsibility. Rabbi Klenicki suggests that tourist agencies alert visitors to the presentation of Judaism and its negative projections - centuries of contempt - which prepared the atmosphere for the Holocaust. </p> <p>In an earlier letter, Rabbi Klenicki and his academic colleagues suggested that Jesus should greet his disciples by saying Shalom, adding : \"Jesus is now always referred to as Jesus rather than Christ. This we see as a helpful step because Jesus is not so far removed from his Jewishness by his name _ we think that the Hebraic name Yeshua could occasionally be used _ it will add to the Jewish atmosphere \" </p> <p>Such suggestions make Huber, who believes he has genuinely tackled anti-semitism, sigh. \"Everything we have done is the product of 100% reflection and humility, but they think we are just a gang of farmers. If, when you see the play you can still taste something anti-semitic, we will have to look further into ourselves.\" </p> <p>Rabbi Klenicki will do just that. He has accepted an invitation from the mayor to attend, and will be in the front row on the first night.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's hard to imagine two more different worlds than contemporary British art, with its avant-garde white spaces and laconic gestures, and British theatre, with its continuing addiction to narrative and social critique. Since their formation in 1984, theatre group Forced Entertainment have tried everything to bridge this gap, from taking an audience on a coach tour of Sheffield to presenting a 24-hour \"durational performance\" at last year's London International Festival of Theatre. How about an arty computer game pro jected large as life at Sheffield's Site Gallery? </p> <p>The city centre is empty, except for someone slumped under a lamp post in the street lights' amber glow. This is not a time and a place you want to be in. The only escape is by touching the body, which leads you to another city street at night, graphite, a wooden door daring you to open it... This is Nightwalks, an interactive art work on CD-rom, directed by Tim Etchells and photographed by Hugo Glendinning, in which members of Forced Entertainment act out some terrible yet unexplained scenario in desolate urban settings at dead of night. </p> <p>Across the road from the gallery, the silver drum shapes of Nigel Coates's National Centre for Popular Music lend Sheffield's cultural quarter a... well, you wouldn't call it glitz. Coates's architecture is emblematic of a changing sense of the city: it seems to mime the excitements of virtual space. Meanwhile at the Site Gallery, virtual space imitates the desolation of a real British city. Nightwalks was photographed in London and Sheffield; the alleys, flats, graveyards and car parks are in some imaginary yet grittily authentic Britain. Sex, murder, dubious transactions - it's all happening down these hyperreal mean streets. But what makes Nightwalks - along with its sister pieces Frozen Palaces and Spin, shot respectively in a Georgian townhouse and a junkyard - so unhealthily entertaining is the way it implicates you. </p> <p>Glendinning has shot a series of 360-degree panoramas in which people bleed, scream, hold seances. They are frozen like statues for you to move around, zoom in, move back for a better view. The actors play murderers, the murdered, and a pantomime horse. It's a game, and one in which they are setting you up as the Hitchcockian film director, or just a psychotic voyeur. The tableaux are full of narrative details that never gel into a \"story\" - there is an analogy with paintings such as Hogarth's Rake's Progress. They are also full of loaded iconography, but it's impossible to tell which scene comes first, what the story is. Your effort to do so becomes the narrative; your urge to see compels you from scene to scene. You are the sinister presence in these rooms and streets. It is your shadow glimpsed on a rainy street at 4am, your invisible presence moving silently and smoothly towards a weeping figure sitting alone in a midnight car park. </p> <p>There's humour here too, a Grand Guignol quality to these scenarios. If the experimental theatre work dries up, Forced Entertainment have a great future as a kind of HammerStudios.com. </p> <p>Artists who work with new media tend to be optimists, even utopians, like the Danish group Superflex who are gradually creating an exact double of the Swedish city of Karlskrona on the internet, arguing that in this virtual space Karlskrona's citizens will be able to negotiate new social relationships. By contrast the virtual world created by Forced Entertainment is not utopian at all; it is a murky replica of contemporary Britain and it chills your blood. Their exercises in video art are less interesting, because they seem to retreat to a more humanist, emotional style, but the fictional British city of Nightwalks is a dreadful, alluring place. You wouldn't want to live there but you probably do.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's hard to imagine two more different worlds than contemporary British art, with its avant-garde white spaces and laconic gestures, and British theatre, with its continuing addiction to narrative and social critique. Since their formation in 1984, theatre group Forced Entertainment have tried everything to bridge this gap, from taking an audience on a coach tour of Sheffield to presenting a 24-hour \"durational performance\" at last year's London International Festival of Theatre. How about an arty computer game pro jected large as life at Sheffield's Site Gallery? The city centre is empty, except for someone slumped under a lamp post in the street lights' amber glow. This is not a time and a place you want to be in. The only escape is by touching the body, which leads you to another city street at night, graphite, a wooden door daring you to open it... This is Nightwalks, an interactive art work on CD-rom, directed by Tim Etchells and photographed by Hugo Glendinning, in which members of Forced Entertainment act out some terrible yet unexplained scenario in desolate urban settings at dead of night. Across the road from the gallery, the silver drum shapes of Nigel Coates's National Centre for Popular Music lend Sheffield's cultural quarter a... well, you wouldn't call it glitz. Coates's architecture is emblematic of a changing sense of the city: it seems to mime the excitements of virtual space. Meanwhile at the Site Gallery, virtual space imitates the desolation of a real British city. Nightwalks was photographed in London and Sheffield; the alleys, flats, graveyards and car parks are in some imaginary yet grittily authentic Britain. Sex, murder, dubious transactions - it's all happening down these hyperreal mean streets. But what makes Nightwalks - along with its sister pieces Frozen Palaces and Spin, shot respectively in a Georgian townhouse and a junkyard - so unhealthily entertaining is the way it implicates you. Glendinning has shot a series of 360-degree panoramas in which people bleed, scream, hold seances. They are frozen like statues for you to move around, zoom in, move back for a better view. The actors play murderers, the murdered, and a pantomime horse. It's a game, and one in which they are setting you up as the Hitchcockian film director, or just a psychotic voyeur. The tableaux are full of narrative details that never gel into a \"story\" - there is an analogy with paintings such as Hogarth's Rake's Progress. They are also full of loaded iconography, but it's impossible to tell which scene comes first, what the story is. Your effort to do so becomes the narrative; your urge to see compels you from scene to scene. You are the sinister presence in these rooms and streets. It is your shadow glimpsed on a rainy street at 4am, your invisible presence moving silently and smoothly towards a weeping figure sitting alone in a midnight car park. There's humour here too, a Grand Guignol quality to these scenarios. If the experimental theatre work dries up, Forced Entertainment have a great future as a kind of HammerStudios.com. Artists who work with new media tend to be optimists, even utopians, like the Danish group Superflex who are gradually creating an exact double of the Swedish city of Karlskrona on the internet, arguing that in this virtual space Karlskrona's citizens will be able to negotiate new social relationships. By contrast the virtual world created by Forced Entertainment is not utopian at all; it is a murky replica of contemporary Britain and it chills your blood. Their exercises in video art are less interesting, because they seem to retreat to a more humanist, emotional style, but the fictional British city of Nightwalks is a dreadful, alluring place. You wouldn't want to live there but you probably do.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is the spiffy, Californian coastal golf course named after Spyglass Hill from Treasure Island, where each hole is called after a character from the book. There is the Louie Louie cafe in the Robert Louis Stevenson school at nearby Pebble Beach, full of busy, impossibly healthy-looking co-eds who will soon be de-constructing Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in their English classes. And there is the galleon-topped monument in San Francisco's Chinatown, standing amid the skate-boarders and the elderly, dozing Chinamen, with its im- precation to the passer-by that he should \"keep a few friends but these without capitulation; above all, on the same grim condition, (to) keep friends with himself\". </p> <p>But in this 150th anniversary year of the birth of RL Stevenson, it is perhaps not the plaques and the place-names that resonate with the time he spent in the United States, but the still contemporary issues on which he focused: on race and the fate of the American Indian; on sudden wealth at times of boom and bonanza and its ability to destroy and divide; on immigration and capital punishment; and, not least, on the joys of Californian wine and the perplexing nature of the telephone. </p> <p>In 1879, Stevenson received a telegram in Edinburgh from Fanny Osbourne, the married American woman with whom he had fallen in love in France three years earlier. The telegram does not survive, but whatever it contained drove Stevenson to pack in haste, and within a week he was setting sail on the SS Devonia from Greenock. \"I am in fair spirits but a little off my nut,\" he wrote from the ship. </p> <p>He can only have been a little further off his nut by the time he arrived in New York. It is reassuring to learn that, even then, Britons about to arrive in America were full of stories of the dreadful things that might befall them. \"You would have thought we were to land upon a cannibal island,\" he wrote. \"You must speak to no one in the streets, as they would not leave you till you were rooked and beaten.\" Today, the vocabulary has changed rooked to mugged, but the sentiment is much the same: these Americans are a wild and violent people, so don't catch their eye in the subway in New York or drive with rent-a-car plates in Florida or you'll come back in a box. It is equally reassuring to discover that, in a land where there is now an (expensive) cure for everything, Stevenson, suffering from a terrible itch, parted with some of his limited funds to purchase a blue pill, a powder and a little bottle of medicine. \"He might as well have given me a cricket bat and a copy of Johnson's dictionary,\" wrote Stevenson of the pharmacist. </p> <p>There was more of the adventurer than the grumpy ex-pat in Stevenson and as he travelled by train across Nebraska, he could write: \"The line of the railway stretched from horizon to horizon, like a cue across a billiard board; on either hand the green plain ran till it touched the skirts of heaven.\" What strikes the reader now is not so much the lyrical descriptions of the landscape, as the observations of his fellow-passengers whom he described in The Amateur Emigrant. Passengers on the train were split into three groups: the families, the single male immigrants and the Chinese. Stevenson wrote: \"Of all stupid ill-feeling, the sentiment of my fellow-Caucasians towards our companions in the Chinese car was the most stupid and the worst _Their forefathers watched the stars before mine had begun to keep pigs.\" </p> <p> In particular, the prevailing attitude to the American Indians struck Stevenson: \"If oppression drives a wise man mad, what should be raging in the heart of these poor tribes, who have been driven back and back, step after step, their promised reservations torn from them one after another as the States extend westward, until at length they are shut up into these hideous mountain deserts of the centre.\" He saw Indian families at way-stations on the journey west much as you might today at some glum Greyhound station: \"The silent stoicism of their conduct, and the pathetic degradation of their appearance, would have touched any thinking creature, but my fellow-passengers danced round them with a truly Cockney baseness. I was ashamed of the thing we call civilisation.\" </p> <p>He was bound for Monterey in California, arriving there somewhat to Fanny's embarrassed surprise, since she was still married and uncertain how to proceed. Stevenson, unable to stay with her because of the conventions of the time, slipped away into the nearby Carmel hills where, always a sickly man, he lapsed into a delirium. He was rescued, as Frank McLynn tells it in his biography, by a bear hunter called Captain Smith and an Indian called Tom, who treated him with frontier remedies until he recovered. </p> <p>He returned to a boarding house in Monterey - now Stevenson House, preserved with many of his artefacts on display. As an author with a local connection, he is somewhat overshadowed by John Steinbeck, since the original Cannery Row is in the town; but perhaps Stevenson would not envy him the tourist spin-offs and the Steinbeck Country insignias. Steinbeck paid gentle homage to Stevenson in his short story, How Edith McGillcuddy Met RLS. </p> <p>I had always had a sneaking, vicarious attachment to Stevenson: we grew up in the same part of Edinburgh, went to the same school, studied in the same law faculty at the same university, edited the same student paper and hot-tailed it in our twenties to California. (Only one of us, at the last count, had become a world-renowned writer.) And so time to retrace a few of his footsteps, to Monterey and that French-Swiss boarding-house where he waited for Fanny to extricate herself finally from her husband, Sam. </p> <p>The house itself is in beautiful condition, the datura and rhododendron in full bloom in the garden, and Stevenson could not have asked for a more devoted carrier of the flame than Monica Hudson, the Swiss woman who is the local RLS expert, co-founder of the new society there in his honour and one of the guides to the house. </p> <p>\"There is a lot of interest still,\" said Hudson, pointing out a family that had just visited the house because the boy had read Treasure Island and was curious to know more. Visitors come from all over the world, with a large contingent from Japan, where Stevenson's poems have all been translated. What they see is some of the strange, eclectic paraphernalia of the writer's life right up to his death in Samoa at the age of 44. There is the Buddha that sat on his desk as he worked; his elegant cigarette case - he was an inveterate smoker who would have been ostracised in California today; a head-hunter's knife. His bedroom in the boarding-house, or the room that seems likeliest to have been his, has in it the bed from his house in Bournemouth, with his velvet jacket lying in ghostly fashion upon it. </p> <p>When Stevenson arrived in Monterey, the population there was \"about that of a dissenting chapel on a wet Sunday in a strong church neighbourhood.\" Now Monterey flourishes, a wealthy, knick-knackered, tourist enclave with its own Path of History and jazz festival. Stevenson used to take his midday meal at a little French restaurant where he was the only Briton in a cosmopolitan crew. </p> <p>The British presence there today is most obvious in two pubs, the Mucky Duck and the Britannia in Alvarado Street, where Stevenson collected his mail from the post office, and both are decorated with fox-hunting prints and copper plates. </p> <p>In the Mucky Duck, some Englishmen with adopted American accents were telling each other a joke: \"What's the definition of a loser? When you meet a nymphomaniac and she tells you she just wants to be friends.\" It had been a long day: I could think of another definition of a loser and started to feel as snooty as Stevenson did towards the Cockney immigrants he encountered on his journey. There was something deeply depressing about all this faux Englishness, the signs with \"Keep your hands off the barmaid\" and the retro poster of Bournemouth, which I am sure was not on the wall because Stevenson had once lived there. </p> <p>In the Britannia later, ordering a McEwans Export in RLS's honour, I was told \"You've made a good choice there\" by the bleached blond young man who served me. His accent was a hybrid, Clyde lapping the Pacific, and it turned out that he was from Glasgow and \"when I'm with my mum\" his accent returned home, too. Yes, Stevenson still brought the tourists in, he said, as an Arsenal game flickered on the box, and his own girlfriend was a pupil at the local Robert Louis Stevenson school. There was a bottle of Treasure Island malt vinegar to put on my French fries. </p> <p>The RL Stevenson school is private, founded in 1952 by a Stevenson admirer and scholar and known locally as the \"Bob Louie\". The director of alumni, Frank Stephenson, invited me to lunch in the Louie Louie cafe. The student literary magazine is called Vailima, after Stevenson's home in Samoa, and the student paper Tusitala, is the teller of tales name given to Stevenson there. The writer also provided the school prayer: \"Lord - give us the strength to encounter that which is to come, that we may be brave in peril, constant in tribulation, temperate in wrath and in all change of fortune, and, down to the gates of death, loyal and loving to one another.\" The pupils sat on the lawns in the sun, one strumming a guitar. </p> <p>Nearby is the Spyglass Hill golf course at Pebble Beach. Stevenson wrote in Treasure Island of the moon as something \"broad and silvery\" moving by the summit of Spyglass Hill, but the only broad and silvery things about the area these days are the golfers. RLS might have enjoyed the idea of people paying $225 a round so that they can tee off from a hole called Blind Pew. Stevenson made some slim pickings writing for the local, long-defunct Monterey Californian. \"The United States Mint can coin many million more dollar pieces but not make a single Indian,\" he wrote. \"No man's word can save the Indian from the fate that awaits them.\" </p> <p>In San Francisco, where Stevenson eventually married Fanny in 1880, there are still traces of his adventurous life. There is a plaque by his old lodgings on Bush Street, now a barber shop with a pile of Playboys for waiting customers. The cafe where he took his morn ing coffees is long gone, but he could have his espresso at Uncle Vito's or tiger prawns Polynesian at Cafe Mozart at the same corner. The place where he and Fanny wed has been subsumed into the Zingari Italian restaurant. </p> <p>The manager there, a Russian who had read Treasure Island in his youth, was anxious that I should try their menu ($85 for a wine extravaganza dinner). The RLS memorial is in Portsmouth Plaza, Chinatown and carries words from Stevenson's Christmas sermon, with his advice about friendship and honesty: \"To be honest, to be kind - to earn a little more, to spend a little less - to make, upon the whole, a family happier for his presence - to renounce when that shall be necessary and not be embittered _ Here is a task for all that a man has of fortitude and delicacy.\" </p> <p>What a rich city San Francisco, in the middle of the dot.com boom, would be for the man who wrote about \"the millionaire vulgarians of the Big Bonanza\". </p> <p>One of his great concerns was capital punishment which he opposed, most tellingly in his novel, Weir of Hermiston. What would he have made of the execution of a Native American in California only last month, an execution finally carried out after the man had been refused permission to take part in a traditional sweat lodge ceremony in the prison grounds, a decision against which he appealed. On the day I was in San Francisco, the court of appeal reversed the decision. Too bad he had already been executed. </p> <p>There are other landmarks of Stevenson's life in California. In Calistoga, north of San Francisco, he used a telephone for the first time. \"So it goes in these young countries,\" he wrote. \"Telephones, and telegraphs, and newspapers, and advertisements running far ahead among the Indians and the grizzly bears.\" God, what would he have made of the mobile phones in Silicon Valley? Californian wine was still \"at the experimental stage\" but Stevenson was spot on in predicting 120 years ago that \"the smack of the Californian palate shall linger on the palate of your grandson\". </p> <p>The Everyman edition of The Silverado Squatters and Travels with a Donkey suggests that Stevenson was a \"precursor of Jack Kerouac and Bruce Chatwin\". He certainly reflected on the nature of nationality and travel. \"The happiest lot on earth is to be born a Scotchman. You must pay for it in many ways as for all other advantages on earth _ the lights of home shine softer on the rainy street; the very names endeared in verse and music cling nearer round our heart. It is at least a curious thing_ that the races which wander widest, Jews and Scotch, should be the most clannish in the world. But perhaps these two are cause and effect: 'for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt'. \" </p> <p>And he could conjure up the strange emotions of travel that give the same frisson more than a century later. \"There is wonderful callousness in human nature which enables us to live. I had no feeling one way or the other from New York to California until at Dutch Flat, a mining camp in the Sierra, I heard a cock crowing with a home voice; and then I fell to hope and regret both in the same moment.\" </p> <p>It is often, too often, said that if Shakespeare were alive today, he would be working in Hollywood. Since most of his work has already been turned into film, he would more likely be counting his royalty cheques in Colorado. Stevenson seems better equipped for the film business. Bertolt Brecht, in his 1925 Notes on Stevenson, observ-ed that \"with Stevenson events are quite clearly visually ordered\". It would have been Stevenson for whom producers would have sent the limos, begging him to come up with another Dr J or a cracking action idea like Kidnapped. </p> <p>Returning from his American journey in 1880, Stevenson entranced fellow-passengers on the boat across the Atlantic with his tales. One of them, James Cunningham, recalled that \"to the accompaniment of endless cigarettes, or sometimes it might be a perilous cocktail which he compounded with such zest from a San Francisco recipe, the stream of romantic and genial talk flowed on.\" </p> <p>Whether as a screenwriter with an adobe home in Twenty-Nine Palms, or as a commentator on all that is remarkable about California - the death penalty, the lingering separation of races, the casinos on the reservations, the wine industry - one trusts that Stevenson would have written with that same mixture of hope and regret, and \"without capitulation\" about the perilous cocktail of life. </p> <p>\u0095 The Silverado Squatters, The Amateur Emigrant, and Treasure Island by RL Stevenson, are all available from Everyman; Robert Louis Stevenson, by Frank McLynn, Pimlico, \u00a312.50</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is the spiffy, Californian coastal golf course named after Spyglass Hill from Treasure Island, where each hole is called after a character from the book. There is the Louie Louie cafe in the Robert Louis Stevenson school at nearby Pebble Beach, full of busy, impossibly healthy-looking co-eds who will soon be de-constructing Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in their English classes. And there is the galleon-topped monument in San Francisco's Chinatown, standing amid the skate-boarders and the elderly, dozing Chinamen, with its im- precation to the passer-by that he should \"keep a few friends but these without capitulation; above all, on the same grim condition, (to) keep friends with himself\". But in this 150th anniversary year of the birth of RL Stevenson, it is perhaps not the plaques and the place-names that resonate with the time he spent in the United States, but the still contemporary issues on which he focused: on race and the fate of the American Indian; on sudden wealth at times of boom and bonanza and its ability to destroy and divide; on immigration and capital punishment; and, not least, on the joys of Californian wine and the perplexing nature of the telephone. In 1879, Stevenson received a telegram in Edinburgh from Fanny Osbourne, the married American woman with whom he had fallen in love in France three years earlier. The telegram does not survive, but whatever it contained drove Stevenson to pack in haste, and within a week he was setting sail on the SS Devonia from Greenock. \"I am in fair spirits but a little off my nut,\" he wrote from the ship. He can only have been a little further off his nut by the time he arrived in New York. It is reassuring to learn that, even then, Britons about to arrive in America were full of stories of the dreadful things that might befall them. \"You would have thought we were to land upon a cannibal island,\" he wrote. \"You must speak to no one in the streets, as they would not leave you till you were rooked and beaten.\" Today, the vocabulary has changed rooked to mugged, but the sentiment is much the same: these Americans are a wild and violent people, so don't catch their eye in the subway in New York or drive with rent-a-car plates in Florida or you'll come back in a box. It is equally reassuring to discover that, in a land where there is now an (expensive) cure for everything, Stevenson, suffering from a terrible itch, parted with some of his limited funds to purchase a blue pill, a powder and a little bottle of medicine. \"He might as well have given me a cricket bat and a copy of Johnson's dictionary,\" wrote Stevenson of the pharmacist. There was more of the adventurer than the grumpy ex-pat in Stevenson and as he travelled by train across Nebraska, he could write: \"The line of the railway stretched from horizon to horizon, like a cue across a billiard board; on either hand the green plain ran till it touched the skirts of heaven.\" What strikes the reader now is not so much the lyrical descriptions of the landscape, as the observations of his fellow-passengers whom he described in The Amateur Emigrant. Passengers on the train were split into three groups: the families, the single male immigrants and the Chinese. Stevenson wrote: \"Of all stupid ill-feeling, the sentiment of my fellow-Caucasians towards our companions in the Chinese car was the most stupid and the worst _Their forefathers watched the stars before mine had begun to keep pigs.\" In particular, the prevailing attitude to the American Indians struck Stevenson: \"If oppression drives a wise man mad, what should be raging in the heart of these poor tribes, who have been driven back and back, step after step, their promised reservations torn from them one after another as the States extend westward, until at length they are shut up into these hideous mountain deserts of the centre.\" He saw Indian families at way-stations on the journey west much as you might today at some glum Greyhound station: \"The silent stoicism of their conduct, and the pathetic degradation of their appearance, would have touched any thinking creature, but my fellow-passengers danced round them with a truly Cockney baseness. I was ashamed of the thing we call civilisation.\" He was bound for Monterey in California, arriving there somewhat to Fanny's embarrassed surprise, since she was still married and uncertain how to proceed. Stevenson, unable to stay with her because of the conventions of the time, slipped away into the nearby Carmel hills where, always a sickly man, he lapsed into a delirium. He was rescued, as Frank McLynn tells it in his biography, by a bear hunter called Captain Smith and an Indian called Tom, who treated him with frontier remedies until he recovered. He returned to a boarding house in Monterey - now Stevenson House, preserved with many of his artefacts on display. As an author with a local connection, he is somewhat overshadowed by John Steinbeck, since the original Cannery Row is in the town; but perhaps Stevenson would not envy him the tourist spin-offs and the Steinbeck Country insignias. Steinbeck paid gentle homage to Stevenson in his short story, How Edith McGillcuddy Met RLS. I had always had a sneaking, vicarious attachment to Stevenson: we grew up in the same part of Edinburgh, went to the same school, studied in the same law faculty at the same university, edited the same student paper and hot-tailed it in our twenties to California. (Only one of us, at the last count, had become a world-renowned writer.) And so time to retrace a few of his footsteps, to Monterey and that French-Swiss boarding-house where he waited for Fanny to extricate herself finally from her husband, Sam. The house itself is in beautiful condition, the datura and rhododendron in full bloom in the garden, and Stevenson could not have asked for a more devoted carrier of the flame than Monica Hudson, the Swiss woman who is the local RLS expert, co-founder of the new society there in his honour and one of the guides to the house. \"There is a lot of interest still,\" said Hudson, pointing out a family that had just visited the house because the boy had read Treasure Island and was curious to know more. Visitors come from all over the world, with a large contingent from Japan, where Stevenson's poems have all been translated. What they see is some of the strange, eclectic paraphernalia of the writer's life right up to his death in Samoa at the age of 44. There is the Buddha that sat on his desk as he worked; his elegant cigarette case - he was an inveterate smoker who would have been ostracised in California today; a head-hunter's knife. His bedroom in the boarding-house, or the room that seems likeliest to have been his, has in it the bed from his house in Bournemouth, with his velvet jacket lying in ghostly fashion upon it. When Stevenson arrived in Monterey, the population there was \"about that of a dissenting chapel on a wet Sunday in a strong church neighbourhood.\" Now Monterey flourishes, a wealthy, knick-knackered, tourist enclave with its own Path of History and jazz festival. Stevenson used to take his midday meal at a little French restaurant where he was the only Briton in a cosmopolitan crew. The British presence there today is most obvious in two pubs, the Mucky Duck and the Britannia in Alvarado Street, where Stevenson collected his mail from the post office, and both are decorated with fox-hunting prints and copper plates. In the Mucky Duck, some Englishmen with adopted American accents were telling each other a joke: \"What's the definition of a loser? When you meet a nymphomaniac and she tells you she just wants to be friends.\" It had been a long day: I could think of another definition of a loser and started to feel as snooty as Stevenson did towards the Cockney immigrants he encountered on his journey. There was something deeply depressing about all this faux Englishness, the signs with \"Keep your hands off the barmaid\" and the retro poster of Bournemouth, which I am sure was not on the wall because Stevenson had once lived there. In the Britannia later, ordering a McEwans Export in RLS's honour, I was told \"You've made a good choice there\" by the bleached blond young man who served me. His accent was a hybrid, Clyde lapping the Pacific, and it turned out that he was from Glasgow and \"when I'm with my mum\" his accent returned home, too. Yes, Stevenson still brought the tourists in, he said, as an Arsenal game flickered on the box, and his own girlfriend was a pupil at the local Robert Louis Stevenson school. There was a bottle of Treasure Island malt vinegar to put on my French fries. The RL Stevenson school is private, founded in 1952 by a Stevenson admirer and scholar and known locally as the \"Bob Louie\". The director of alumni, Frank Stephenson, invited me to lunch in the Louie Louie cafe. The student literary magazine is called Vailima, after Stevenson's home in Samoa, and the student paper Tusitala, is the teller of tales name given to Stevenson there. The writer also provided the school prayer: \"Lord - give us the strength to encounter that which is to come, that we may be brave in peril, constant in tribulation, temperate in wrath and in all change of fortune, and, down to the gates of death, loyal and loving to one another.\" The pupils sat on the lawns in the sun, one strumming a guitar. Nearby is the Spyglass Hill golf course at Pebble Beach. Stevenson wrote in Treasure Island of the moon as something \"broad and silvery\" moving by the summit of Spyglass Hill, but the only broad and silvery things about the area these days are the golfers. RLS might have enjoyed the idea of people paying $225 a round so that they can tee off from a hole called Blind Pew. Stevenson made some slim pickings writing for the local, long-defunct Monterey Californian. \"The United States Mint can coin many million more dollar pieces but not make a single Indian,\" he wrote. \"No man's word can save the Indian from the fate that awaits them.\" In San Francisco, where Stevenson eventually married Fanny in 1880, there are still traces of his adventurous life. There is a plaque by his old lodgings on Bush Street, now a barber shop with a pile of Playboys for waiting customers. The cafe where he took his morn ing coffees is long gone, but he could have his espresso at Uncle Vito's or tiger prawns Polynesian at Cafe Mozart at the same corner. The place where he and Fanny wed has been subsumed into the Zingari Italian restaurant. The manager there, a Russian who had read Treasure Island in his youth, was anxious that I should try their menu ($85 for a wine extravaganza dinner). The RLS memorial is in Portsmouth Plaza, Chinatown and carries words from Stevenson's Christmas sermon, with his advice about friendship and honesty: \"To be honest, to be kind - to earn a little more, to spend a little less - to make, upon the whole, a family happier for his presence - to renounce when that shall be necessary and not be embittered _ Here is a task for all that a man has of fortitude and delicacy.\" What a rich city San Francisco, in the middle of the dot.com boom, would be for the man who wrote about \"the millionaire vulgarians of the Big Bonanza\". One of his great concerns was capital punishment which he opposed, most tellingly in his novel, Weir of Hermiston. What would he have made of the execution of a Native American in California only last month, an execution finally carried out after the man had been refused permission to take part in a traditional sweat lodge ceremony in the prison grounds, a decision against which he appealed. On the day I was in San Francisco, the court of appeal reversed the decision. Too bad he had already been executed. There are other landmarks of Stevenson's life in California. In Calistoga, north of San Francisco, he used a telephone for the first time. \"So it goes in these young countries,\" he wrote. \"Telephones, and telegraphs, and newspapers, and advertisements running far ahead among the Indians and the grizzly bears.\" God, what would he have made of the mobile phones in Silicon Valley? Californian wine was still \"at the experimental stage\" but Stevenson was spot on in predicting 120 years ago that \"the smack of the Californian palate shall linger on the palate of your grandson\". The Everyman edition of The Silverado Squatters and Travels with a Donkey suggests that Stevenson was a \"precursor of Jack Kerouac and Bruce Chatwin\". He certainly reflected on the nature of nationality and travel. \"The happiest lot on earth is to be born a Scotchman. You must pay for it in many ways as for all other advantages on earth _ the lights of home shine softer on the rainy street; the very names endeared in verse and music cling nearer round our heart. It is at least a curious thing_ that the races which wander widest, Jews and Scotch, should be the most clannish in the world. But perhaps these two are cause and effect: 'for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt'. \" And he could conjure up the strange emotions of travel that give the same frisson more than a century later. \"There is wonderful callousness in human nature which enables us to live. I had no feeling one way or the other from New York to California until at Dutch Flat, a mining camp in the Sierra, I heard a cock crowing with a home voice; and then I fell to hope and regret both in the same moment.\" It is often, too often, said that if Shakespeare were alive today, he would be working in Hollywood. Since most of his work has already been turned into film, he would more likely be counting his royalty cheques in Colorado. Stevenson seems better equipped for the film business. Bertolt Brecht, in his 1925 Notes on Stevenson, observ-ed that \"with Stevenson events are quite clearly visually ordered\". It would have been Stevenson for whom producers would have sent the limos, begging him to come up with another Dr J or a cracking action idea like Kidnapped. Returning from his American journey in 1880, Stevenson entranced fellow-passengers on the boat across the Atlantic with his tales. One of them, James Cunningham, recalled that \"to the accompaniment of endless cigarettes, or sometimes it might be a perilous cocktail which he compounded with such zest from a San Francisco recipe, the stream of romantic and genial talk flowed on.\" Whether as a screenwriter with an adobe home in Twenty-Nine Palms, or as a commentator on all that is remarkable about California - the death penalty, the lingering separation of races, the casinos on the reservations, the wine industry - one trusts that Stevenson would have written with that same mixture of hope and regret, and \"without capitulation\" about the perilous cocktail of life. \u0095 The Silverado Squatters, The Amateur Emigrant, and Treasure Island by RL Stevenson, are all available from Everyman; Robert Louis Stevenson, by Frank McLynn, Pimlico, \u00a312.50",

They were Errazuriz Sauvignon Blanc 1999 (\u00a35.49) and Errazuriz Merlot 1999 (\u00a35.99), and both are from Chile. The sauvignon is an elegantly mineralised specimen, showing compressed gooseberry, under-ripe apple fruit and a finish of some finesse. It is a sublime sauvignon with which no Sancerre is comparable. The merlot is composed of crushed blackcurrants and soft, silky leather. It's effortlessly rich and flowing. A remarkably eloquent wine, it falters only if the food is too pungent, but with risotto it was marvellous. Each wine rates 17 points, and you can buy them at Oddbins, Thresher, Bottoms Up, Wine Rack and Victoria Wine. </p> <p>Oddbins, as it happens, has a terrific pair of Chilean reds. La Palmeria Cabernet Sauvignon 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.99) has that ineffable Chilean richness and smoothly textured finish, and, at the price, there can be very very few cabernets ahead of it. La Palmeria Merlot 1999 (16 points, around \u00a34.50-\u00a35.00, and also available at Unwins) is chutzpah vinified, being rich, aromatic and subtly spicy - and all this gushes from the bottle the second the cork is pulled. The eager, leathery, soft fruit is ripe yet not inelegant, in spite of the cheek of its immediacy. Neither is it so forward that the whole construct fails to be deeply and rewardingly palate-provoking. Earthier, and with great character and bite, is Chteau Depaule Cabardes 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99, Oddbins), from the Midi. It parades tobacco, coffee, plums - plus texture - and it has an exciting tension between the fruit and the acidity. A bold, complex wine at a fairly absurd price. </p> <p>Somerfield is the master of absurd prices, and Santa Julia Sangiovese 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.99), from Argentina, is a splendid example. It is a wonderful paradox of dryness and richness, vivacious, plummy fruitiness yet not vulgarity. Somerfield is also offering, until April 25, Gouts et Couleurs Chardonnay/Viognier 1998, from the south of France, for \u00a33.49. It is deliciously apricot- and melon-scented and fruited, and it rates 15.5 points.

The bill, in particular, was a model of clarity, with each item consumed plainly set out, the quantity, the unit price and the total for each all in a neat line and underlined.

The smoked fish inside produced a solid impact, while the frothed-up sauce, made with the poaching liquid, was like a shadow of the fish itself. Buttered leeks added a minor-key earthy sweetness to the dish.</p> <p>Bunbury's oxtail raviolo was up there on the rostrum alongside the tortellini: a single, great, fat bolster of sweetly succulent oxtail. The pasta had a slightly softer texture than mine, and was suited to the dish. The sauce was a beautifully-judged reduction of cooking liquids, which carried the flavours with limpid brilliance. The grainy lentils and soft cabbage added their own notes of contrast.</p> <p>Bunbury was not so ecstatic about his main course, scallops with black-pudding crepinettes and asparagus. It wasn't the individual elements of the dish that put him off. Indeed, there was a lot to admire in the technical precision and finesse with which they were cooked.

Whatever - as they say on Jerry Springer - she was very quiet as we drove south and didn't offer her tongue when I kissed her goodnight. Ugh. </p> <p><strong> Tuesday, April 11 </strong></p> <p> This morning, I handed William his usual carrier bag full of toilet rolls and squashed cereal packets and was amazed when he handed it straight back to me, saying, \"We can't play at school any more, Dad, so don't collect 'em up.\"</p> <p> At home time, I broke the rules and waited outside William's classroom. On looking through the glass panel in the door I saw that the children were sitting in rows being taught exam techniques by an \"exam trainer\". (Formerly known as a teaching assistant.) The weather chart and the nature table were nowhere to be seen. The hamster cage was empty.</p> <p> There were various exhortations around the room. As I watched, the exam trainer wrote \"Exams are good, play is bad\" on the white board. The children dipped their pens in their inkwells and copied this slogan down. Since when has it been compulsory to write in ink? I fear that once again Mrs Parvez has misinterpreted education-department guidelines.</p> <p> She won't be content until the children are wearing clogs. </p> <p><strong> Wednesday, April 12 </strong></p> <p> I embarked on a new novel, Sty, today. Progress was slow. I only managed to write 104 words, including the title and my name. </p> <p> <strong>Sty, by Adrian Mole. </strong></p> <p> The pig grunted in its sty. It was deeply sad. Somehow it felt different from the other pigs with which it shared a home.</p> <p> \"Look at them,\" thought the pig. \"They are oblivious to the fact that they are merely part of the food chain.\" The pig had felt discontented since it had glimpsed Alain de Botton's TV programme, Philosophy: A Guide to Life, through a gap in the pig farmer's curtain. The wisdom of Socrates, Epicurus and Montaigne had brought home to the pigs that it was completely uneducated and knew nothing of the world beyond the sty. </p> <p><strong> Notes on new novel</strong><br>1. Should the pig have a name?<br> 2. Should the pig's thoughts be in quotes? <br>3. Has the story got legs? Or is the main protagonist (the pig) too restricting a character, ie, being (a) unable to communicate with the other pigs and (b) never leaving the sty? </p> <p><strong> Sunday, April 16 </strong></p> <p> Pamela Pigg has just left this house after flying into a rage and accusing me of stealing her life and turning it into \"fifth-rate art\". She read my manuscript of Sty which I had foolishly left on the kitchen table under a copy of Men's Health. As she ran to her car, I shouted, \"I'm an artist, we must forage where we can for our materials.\" </p> <p> Pamela shouted back, \"I'm a housing officer. We must cancel the artist's move to a maisonette as promised.\" I went inside and read page 124 of Men's Health - bed-busting sex, for my art, of course.</p>",

As I watched, the exam trainer wrote \"Exams are good, play is bad\" on the white board. The children dipped their pens in their inkwells and copied this slogan down. Since when has it been compulsory to write in ink? I fear that once again Mrs Parvez has misinterpreted education-department guidelines. She won't be content until the children are wearing clogs. Wednesday, April 12 I embarked on a new novel, Sty, today. Progress was slow. I only managed to write 104 words, including the title and my name. Sty, by Adrian Mole. The pig grunted in its sty. It was deeply sad. Somehow it felt different from the other pigs with which it shared a home. \"Look at them,\" thought the pig. \"They are oblivious to the fact that they are merely part of the food chain.\" The pig had felt discontented since it had glimpsed Alain de Botton's TV programme, Philosophy: A Guide to Life, through a gap in the pig farmer's curtain. The wisdom of Socrates, Epicurus and Montaigne had brought home to the pigs that it was completely uneducated and knew nothing of the world beyond the sty. Notes on new novel 1. Should the pig have a name? 2. Should the pig's thoughts be in quotes? 3. Has the story got legs? Or is the main protagonist (the pig) too restricting a character, ie, being (a) unable to communicate with the other pigs and (b) never leaving the sty? Sunday, April 16 Pamela Pigg has just left this house after flying into a rage and accusing me of stealing her life and turning it into \"fifth-rate art\". She read my manuscript of Sty which I had foolishly left on the kitchen table under a copy of Men's Health. As she ran to her car, I shouted, \"I'm an artist, we must forage where we can for our materials.\" Pamela shouted back, \"I'm a housing officer. We must cancel the artist's move to a maisonette as promised.\" I went inside and read page 124 of Men's Health - bed-busting sex, for my art, of course.",

May flowerers are in a far stronger position, especially if their flowering is spread over so many weeks that frost damage at some point can be shrugged off by later-opening flower buds.</p> <p>One of the most forgiving in this respect, and one of the most suitable for the smaller garden, is Magnolia liliflora 'Nigra'. It makes a compact bush to 2.5m. The flowers are elegantly elongated, rich reddish-purple on the outside and pale within. It flowers from a baby, but does not like lime. As branches come freely down to the ground, they are easily layered. Layering can be done at almost any season, but is easiest when there is not so much foliage that you cannot see what you are doing.</p> <p>Even more brightly coloured is the classy magnolia 'Galaxy' (5m) in a vivid shade of deep pink. You will be thrilled by this. Although it grows quite tall, its rather narrow, upright habit means that it does not occupy an embarrassing amount of lateral space. It often starts flowering before the end of March.</p> <p>The bay laurel, Laurus nobilis (3m), makes a delightful, many-stemmed shrub/tree if you can allow it the space (see Spadework, right). Bays are usually clipped, which is all right as far at it goes, but the habit of an unpruned - or not obviously pruned - specimen has an engaging freedom and ebullience, which is especially pleasing at this moment when covered with blossom. This is yellowish, though not a bit showy, but you notice its abundance and it releases the bay aroma on its surroundings with an added sweetness. Bees love it. If you have to clip a bay, it will be subject to attack by some nasties, including scale insects and aphids, but an unpruned tree generally remains trouble-free.</p> <p>Three closely-related species of geranium come into their own now and will be flowering for the next two months. They all have in common distinctly fleshy leaf stalks. Geranium rubescens is the smallest of them, and looks like a giant-sized herb robert ( G. robertianum ), which is a more or less welcome garden weed. G. rubescens (0.5m) is a self-seeding biennial, making handsome rosettes in winter with crimson leaf stalks. It has showy, pink flowers from now on, and we like it so much that it is quite a feature through some of our borders, although if not watched, it is a little inclined to overwhelm its neighbours. It is absolutely hardy.</p> <p>The much larger-growing G. palmatum , on the other hand, is hardy only in a sunny, sheltered spot, but that, too, will self-sow. It makes a bulky plant, with a dense rosette of bright green, nicely dissected foliage, which nurses a widely spraying inflorescence (1m) of mauvy-pink flowers. This geranium does not develop a woody stem, which distinguishes it from another Madeiran species with which it is often confused, G. maderense . This latter is by far the largest-growing of all the cranesbills, and makes a very imposing rosette of deeply divided leaves, for which alone it is worth growing. For most of us, however, this needs to be under glass, unless we live right on a frost-free coast, as in the Ventnor Botanic Garden in the Isle of Wight, where there is a gorgeous self-sowing, self-perpetuating colony.</p> <p>To flower (after which it seeds and dies), G. maderense needs plenty of root space, as in a very large container or planted out in a greenhouse bed. Alternatively, heavy feeding will do the trick, but remember that most of its growing is in winter, which is the season when we withold added nutrients from most of our plants. Not in this case. Flowering is dramatic, with a mass of light-magenta blossom, but by then the foliage is beginning to die off. Give it a run, and remember that if it disappoints, the fault is yours, not the plant's.</p> <p>Among the perennials whose striking foliage looks its best in spring are members of the genus Ferula . They are the giant fennels, but must not be confused with the strongly aniseed-smelling fennel ( Foeniculum ) that we use in cooking and that will seed itself tenaciously all over the garden unless we watch out. Ferula does nothing like that. It can be grown from your own-saved seed after it has had a flowering. It does not flower every year, but here again matters can be greatly improved and speeded up by growing your giant fennels in rather good soil. Most of those available in this country are pretty hardy.</p> <p>F. communis makes a few enormous leaves, but they are so finely and intricately divided that you would scarcely suspect that all that wonderful confection of fresh green mounds could come from perhaps only three or four leaves. If the plant does decide to flower, it will rapidly send a stem up to 3m, with branching platforms of yellow, parsnip-like flowers. Everything dies away from midsummer, and you can plant close to it with an annual.</p> <p>There are glaucous-leaved types, and a bright green one with larger, shining leaflets, F. tingitana 'Cedric Morris' (2m), which flowers regularly and is showy.</p> <p>The evergreen Fatsia japonica is just about the boldest-leaved shrub we can grow outdoors in Britain. It flowers in November, but its heads of ivy-like, black berries only ripen now. Collect the seed and sow it fresh, under glass. Even without heat, it will germinate in a few weeks and you can have a grove of fatsias in future years</p>",

If the plant does decide to flower, it will rapidly send a stem up to 3m, with branching platforms of yellow, parsnip-like flowers. Everything dies away from midsummer, and you can plant close to it with an annual. There are glaucous-leaved types, and a bright green one with larger, shining leaflets, F. tingitana 'Cedric Morris' (2m), which flowers regularly and is showy. The evergreen Fatsia japonica is just about the boldest-leaved shrub we can grow outdoors in Britain. It flowers in November, but its heads of ivy-like, black berries only ripen now. Collect the seed and sow it fresh, under glass. Even without heat, it will germinate in a few weeks and you can have a grove of fatsias in future years",

      "body": "<p>The little silver dart of a fish - the genus Engraulis or, as it's more commonly known, the anchovy - is found in all manner of tiny, decorated tins and jars on supermarket and delicatessen shelves. Unlike the jarred variety, however, the tins - which are of roughly the same price - show nothing of their quality at all. While it is good news that these places stock such items at all, it is irritating in the extreme that what they have on offer, anchovy-wise, is generally the worst-tasting of that ilk. As with so many a choice ingredient, while the real thing is sublime, the cheapened variety inevitably turns out to be a grave disappointment.</p> <p>Of course, top-notch ingredients are never cheap, but anchovies at their best are really very good - if price is a concern, remember that you need only a few fillets to pep up a salad or sauce, say. Preserved in salt, they keep splendidly in the fridge for some time. Those stored in oil, however, need swift consumption, irrespective of what the best-before date says.</p> <p>So, what makes a \"good\" anchovy? These fish are found the world over, but it is the anchovy of the Mediterranean, Engraulis encrasicholus , that is the true anchovy, and which the locals know, love and use in huge quantities. Some are sold fresh in markets all along the Mediterranean coastline, to be eaten, just lightly grilled, with a little squeeze of lemon juice. But most are preserved, in one way or another.</p> <p>Once, the anchovy was fished, filleted and layered in salt, then left for at least a month to cure in the vast amount of liquid it exudes during this process. Until recently, this was common practice, and had been so for a few thousand years - bought anchovies were always salted, and notable for the extraordinary brick-red colour they developed while salting. Nowadays, however, most anchovies are tinned - and therein lies a sorry tale. Compare the splendidly jolly, brightly-decorated tins of Spain with the dour packaging preferred by British companies, and you'll see who holds the anchovy closest to heart. (Unsurprisingly, the finest tinned anchovies I've ever eaten were Spanish.) As with salted, the only real visible proof of the quality of a tinned anchovy is its colour: embrace only plump, red fillets, and steer well clear of grey matter.</p> <p>In the kitchen, the anchovy serves all manner of purposes. There are the great dishes that feature an abundance of these wonderful fish, and in a manner that is more akin to a homage to the little creatures - for example, the great Proven\u00e7al pizza of onions and anchovy, the Pissaladi\u00e8re, so-called because of the crock, called a pissal , in which the anchovies were once cured; or ancho\u00efade, a marvellous ointment made from anchovy, garlic and olive oil. Then, there are occasions in which they not are quite so prominent but nonetheless integral - in salsa verde, say, the heady, green sauce of anchovy, capers, garlic and olive oil that so perfectly accompanies poached fishes and meats; or in bagna cauda, the gorgeous anchovy, garlic and olive oil dipping sauce for vegetables. It is no coincidence that these are two of the most celebrated sauces in the cooking of Italy.</p> <p>But, as mentioned above, the anchovy need not always be present in numbers. In fact, on many occasions, its very presence in a dish would go undetected were it not for the cook's ego, which just has to show off and explain the role of the anchovy in a dish's preparation as the first forkfuls are reaching the mouths of the hungry guests. The effect is all too often instantaneous: forks are returned, still laden, to plates and, several embarrassed coughs later, a chorus of high-pitched announcements rises up, claiming an inability to eat anchovies. Of course, it is sometimes wise to alert the unsuspecting diner that he or she is about to eat something that they genuinely abhor, but where anchovies are concerned, it is all too often not the fish itself that causes consternation, and rather the mouth-puckering sensation of eating something that tastes like a gobful of salt.</p> <p>This may explain why many prefer cooking with anchovies that have been preserved in oil, believing them to be less salty than those preserved in, well, salt, and so more likely to allay any fears of assaulting a friend in such a way as to render their palate unconscious for days. But how many people, in these islands at least, have a lust for eating an anchovy straight from the tin? Very few, I'd hazard. Were you to use salted anchovy, on the other hand, you would need to taste the desalinated anchovy to ascertain what degree of salt remained within the fish, and whether further soaking were called for. A simple rule to follow is this: once infused within the structure of a dish, removal of anchovy is impossible; used wisely, however, and their removal is unnecessary.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Sage and anchovy fritters</b></p> <p>Aka involtini di salvia - inspired by the version in A Taste Of Tuscany, by Leslie Forbes.</p> <p><b> Anchovy fillets</b></p> <p><b>1 bunch fresh sage</b></p> <p><b>Beaten egg</b></p> <p><b>Flour, sifted and lightly seasoned</b></p> <p>Taste the anchovies first, to check for saltiness - soak them in water for half-an-hour or so if they are too strong. Sandwich each anchovy fillet between two leaves of sage, thread a cocktail stick through to secure, then dip first in egg and then in flour. Lay the prepared bundles on a tray. Heat a fryer with clean, light oil and fry the involtini until they are puffed up and crisp. Serve immediately.</p> <p><b> Montpellier butter</b></p> <p>A great butter sauce that sits happily upon steamed or poached fish.</p> <p><b> 130g picked tarragon, flat-leaf parsley, chervil, chives, watercress and young spinach</b></p> <p><b>30g shallots</b></p> <p><b>3 small gherkins</b></p> <p><b>2 tsp salted capers, well rinsed</b></p> <p><b>2 small cloves garlic</b></p> <p><b>6 anchovy fillets</b></p> <p><b>1 raw egg yolk</b></p> <p><b>3 hard-boiled egg yolks</b></p> <p><b>125g unsalted butter, softened</b></p> <p><b>90ml extra-virgin olive oil</b></p> <p>The texture of this sauce when made in a pestle and mortar is sublime, but use a food processor by all means if you prefer an easier time.

Cool the leaves in iced water, and drain, squeezing out any excess of water.</p> <p>Put all the ingredients, bar the olive oil, into a food processor or pestle, and whizz or grind away until the texture is smooth. Pour on the olive oil in a fine drizzle, and stir in. Pile the mix on to a sheet of cling-film, roll it into a tight sausage shape and refrigerate. The butter will keep for three or four days.

If using salted anchovies, rinse and divest them of bones first. (It's a good idea to desalinate a large batch, and layer any that you don't use in good olive oil, as they'll keep in the fridge for a week and make a perfect excuse to eat more anchovies.) Put the cheese, anchovies, butter, oil and pepper in a food processor, and chop to a creamy consistency.

There is certainly a heaven that we go to after we die. How would you like to be remembered? First as a good Christian, and second as a Zulu. I also hope that people will say, 'Shabalala was a man who spoke of peace. He tried to make people throw away the hatred that divides people and pushes away happiness.'",

But \"No Actors\", as I believe was once a common sight? Mmm. Lead me to it. It's funny how other people who work in what are thought to be overpaid, parasitical occupations - estate agent, stockbroker, politician, hack - are routinely mocked and reviled. Yet I don't remember the last time I heard an Actor Joke - not since that old one about the out-of-work actor who comes home to find his wife raped and his dog dead. \"Your agent did it,\" whimpers his wife. \"Oh, God!\" says the actor. \"Did he leave a message?\" </p> <p>No, actors have done a damn good job presenting themselves as The People's Friend, and it's the best acting job any of them ever does. But the facts are somewhat different. Despite its outlaw credentials, acting is as conservative, selfish and reactionary a profession as you'll find; politically, they make prison officers look like social workers. The acting profession is snobbish (hence the continuing veneration of the useless Redgraves), racist (when did you last see a black actor playing anything but a mug or a thug?) and so sexist that women stop existing between the ages of 40 and 60, when they are allowed back in reduced numbers, so long as they play dotty old biddies. </p> <p>Last week, one Jennifer Tuckett, a student at Cambridge, claimed that she had been kept out of the famous Footlights society by the boy's club that dominates drama there, and only allowed on stage when a young blonde stripped to her underwear was needed. \"Everything was so male-dominated and incredibly intimidating. There are about 10 people on the Footlights committee; they all tend to be male. Women find it very intimidating, and friends tend to give their friends important roles.\" Sadly, some might say that if a woman is determined to be an actor, Footlights are only doing the decent thing in giving her a taste of how her working life is going to be, like it or lump it; surely only a woman with either a skin thicker than a rhino's or else a masochistic streak a mile wide would choose to continue in such a profession. </p> <p>I never thought I'd have cause to agree with that big blethering perm-on-a-stick Michael Caine about anything, but he was totally right about this country's stuck-up thespians, as were Jane Horrocks, Bob Hoskins and Ray Winstone when they supported him. Though, of course, Caine himself, being an actor, is prey to all their vices; coming to fame during the heyday of British film-making, it didn't take him long to object to paying a decent level of tax and push off to America in order to stretch himself with such life-enhancing artefacts as The Swarm IV, The Hand and Blame It On Rio. </p> <p>In fact, he is exactly the sort of actor - feet supposedly planted in the soil, hands grabbing at any fast buck floating by - who you'd expect to see in the new Barclays advert. In a brilliant example of our old friend socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor, Barclays have paid Christ knows how much to a trio of actors - Anthony Hopkins, Tim Roth, Nick Moran, who have all made a great to-do about their alleged bucking of the system - to tout their slimy product while laying off workers and stranding clients by the hundreds of thousands. But then, allegedly left-wing British actors have always made me laugh - Roth and Gary Oldman come immediately to mind - because of their habit, during the reign of Mrs Thatcher, of leaving the country in a self-righteous strop about right-wing repression and then not moving to Cuba or Sweden, both of whose cinema is in good health and well subsidised by their governments. No, where did they go to escape Fatcher's Britain - why, Reagan's America, that famous bastion of freedom and equality! The new rash of British gangster films, wherein public-school directors exploit the real desperation and degradation of the working-class for comic effect, are yet another expression of this vicious hypocrisy; see Vinnie Jones as a Cockney Uncle Tom, dropping his aitches and swallowing his pride for the glory of well-born Guy Ritchie. </p> <p>It is refreshing, then, when an actor makes no pretence whatsoever of caring about the greater good, but simply follows his heart and his nose to the place where he will find the greatest wealth and ease possible on this planet. Step forward Anthony Hopkins, who has finished what he started with the Barclays ad by becoming an American citizen. I found it particularly touching that one of the people from his home town of Port Talbot who put the boot in was the local postmaster, Asghar Ali, an Asian, who spat: \"Sir Anthony is always harping on about his Welshness, but when the chips are down he goes away. To be honest, I think he is a hypocrite.\" </p> <p>No, not a hypocrite, Mr Ali, but an actor ; a mercenary and a freebooter, if you want to be nasty about it, a citizen of the world if you buy their own brand. An Asian may easily become a Welshman within one generation, but an actor calls only the mirror home. A lifetime spent pretending that you are other people must surely distort your \"real\" emotions, till such concepts as loyalty and integrity seem quite . . . subjective , somehow, like pain and poverty in that Brecht song about Los Angeles doubling as Heaven for the rich and Hell for the poor. </p> <p> As a child, I used to love films and film stars, but now find that the whole idea fills me with horror. Why? Why do we need to escape from our own lives so much that we will pay a few dozen people millions of dollars in order to waste their lives dressing up, spouting someone else's words and generally getting themselves well confused? Why do \"serious\" actors such as Richard Gere, Winona Ryder and Sean Penn make TV commercials that cannot be shown in America? Are they ashamed of themselves? Why, if a woman shows her sex organs to one stranger is she a prostitute, but if she shows them to millions, like Demi Moore and Sharon Stone, she is a superstar? Why are people paid a pittance for being real nurses, but a fortune for pretending to be nurses? </p> <p>Ultimately, it is these and many other questions which will keep actors on the fronts of our newspapers and in the slipstreams of our subconscious; not, as they believe, for what they reveal to us about the human condition when they are practising their art, but for what they reveal when they are at their ease, or cutting that deal, or pulling up that skirt. They are our holy fools, and no money could ever be too much reward for the spectacles they make of themselves so that we may escape with at least a little dignity.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As a young man, he believed his eyes frightened people, and he was probably right. Even now they have an owl-like quality; pale-green, a little too alert, cold and unblinking. Age has crumpled and softened the rest of him. The jowls sag, there are liver spots on his broad forehead, but he remains sturdy and handsome, unbowed by his 71 years. He wears faded jeans, battered black Reeboks, a blood-red bandana tucked inside his sweater. He feels a bit stiff because he played tennis last night.</p> <p>The apartment is elegant and orderly, not plush. The living room, flooded with spring sunlight, looks out over the Jardin de Luxembourg. This has been home for half his life; he and his wife, Janine, raised their son Pierre here, and his office is upstairs.</p> <p>We sit at the marble coffee table under bookshelves stacked with monographs - painters, photographers, African and Oceanic art - and reams of literature, classic and modern. His New York idiom is dated, contorted by decades of speaking French, and his English vocabulary is rusty: at one point he growls, \"How do you say it now . . . people without jobs? Oh, yeah, unemployed.\"</p> <p>Thirty years ago, William Klein was famous, even infamous. True, he's still relatively well known in Paris, but elsewhere, those who recognise the name think of him as a photographer who did his best work in the 50s and 60s. A few cinema buffs will know him as the director of several ground-breaking films. In fact, he's much more than that.</p> <p>He says he wasn't really a photographer at all, and each of his four photographic monographs, on which much of his reputation is based, took an average of only three months to shoot, and a couple more for the design, typography, covers, text and layout - all of which he did himself. No, he sees himself as an multi-disciplinary avant-garde artist. Big shows in San Francisco, books flying out of the stores in Tokyo, that sort of thing. And certainly, over the past four-and-a-half decades he has moved freely between disciplines as diverse as abstract painting, graphic design, art and fashion photography, documentary and feature films, even TV commercials.</p> <p>His latest film is a quasi-documentary interpretation of Handel's Messiah. \"Beautiful, funny, tragic, scary, all at once,\" is his immodest description of a film depicting various amateur and ecclesiastical choirs in America, Russia, France and Spain performing the title work, as well as \"a lot of ordinary life\" - tattoo parlours, prisons, desert landscapes and political demonstrations. The Messiah, he says, is both homage to, and satire on, Handel's masterpiece. \"For example, Christmas dinner at a homeless refuge here in Paris was one of the most frightening things that you can imagine. And during that sequence, you have this beautiful black singer, Nicole Heaston, singing, 'Rejoice, rejoice . . .' \"</p> <p>If Klein has been pigeonholed as a photographer and image-maker, it is because, 43 years ago, his first book changed the theory and practice of photography. New York, or to give it its full title, Life Is Good And Good For You In New York: Trance Witness Revels, was published in Paris in 1956. Klein's black-and-white photographs - gritty, blurred, chaotic and violent, full of reflections, hidden detail and sweeping, geometric power - captured the social upheaval and consumerism of New York in the post-war era, but they went beyond social comment to celebrate a new language: Klein took the advertising slogans and logos of Coca-Cola, Philip Morris, Seven-Up, Esso, Hoover, Lucky Strike and Wonder Bread, and created the first alphabet of Pop Art.</p> <p>The book also had a 16-page pull-out brochure parodying the Daily News, with stunted headlines and classified ads for hypnotism and body-building courses, and a tin of Franco-American Spaghetti - a precursor of the Campbell's Soup paintings that would make Warhol a household name. Even the text clearly anticipated Warhol's deadpan assertion that success and popularity were the supreme artistic criteria.</p> <p>\"Let us Praise the Dollar,\" wrote Klein, \"the most beautiful, the most exciting, the most important thing in New York, its coat of arms, the 13th sign of its zodiac, the fifth element . . . The masterpieces of American culture are skyscrapers, gangster films, westerns, animated cartoons . . . advertising, Marilyn Monroe, Broadway at night, television. The $ is a means of expression, and the artists who have learned to work in this medium, who can produce money-making masterpieces, will become the real American Artists. And the day when Ugliness shall no longer profit will be Their Day, beauty will fill the banks, beauty will be a commodity, only beauty will sell, then shall dawn the Age Of The Beautiful Dollar and everything will be just gorgeous.\"</p> <p>As a visionary manifesto for Pop Art, published six years before the fact, New York was astonishingly prescient. At the time, remember, Warhol was still a young hack illustrator, sketching shoe ads and frocks for Harper's Bazaar. Klein has continued in a similar vein ever since, tracing a mercurial and sometimes brilliant trajectory through the visual arts of the late 20th century. Of course, he should be famous - or at least more famous.</p> <p>Though born into a petit-bourgeois orthodox Jewish family in 1928, Klein grew up poor, his father having lost everything in the Wall Street Crash, and the household moving to progressively rougher neighbourhoods. As a matter of survival, he developed a streetwise attitude, but from an early age wanted to be an artist. While fellow students discussed politics - he won a scholarship to an experimental high school - he and his friends would cut classes to visit the Museum of Modern Art three times a week. \"It wasn't like it is today,\" he recalls. \"In the 40s, it was empty. We had the whole place to ourselves.\"</p> <p>On graduating at 18, he let himself be drafted into the army, having realised he would be sent to occupied Germany, where he supplemented his pay as a poker shark. \"Most of the other soldiers were older than me, and sent money back to their families, so they were more prudent. But I was young and didn't give a shit, so I would bluff and maybe win two, three hundred dollars.\" Klein emerged from one winning hand with a Rolleiflex camera, with which he took his first photos.</p> <p>He and 25 other GIs were selected under a Franco-American cultural programme to study at the Sorbonne. Klein had the knack of landing on his feet: he spent half his military service in Paris, studying French culture and history, and a new topic called Existentialism. After the army, he studied with the painter Fernand L\u00e9ger. It was his only formal artistic training, and though brief, it marked him for life.</p> <p>\"L\u00e9ger was not only the first artist I ever met, but also the first pop artist, and he blew our minds. He told us to get out of our studios and go down into the streets and look at the life around us. He told us that what was happening was not in museums or galleries, but on the walls of the city, in its advertising and signs. And he told us to open ourselves to collaboration with other artists, and architects.\"</p> <p>Klein took him at his word and, in 1952, aged 24, found himself in Milan, exhibiting linear black-and-white paintings which fore-shadowed the op-art of the 60s. This led to a job painting interior murals for an Italian architect, based on abstract designs that he had made in the darkroom working with light and photographic paper. These appeared in Domus art magazine, attracting the attention of Vogue art director, Alexander Liberman.</p> <p>Liberman realised Klein was unsuited to office life, but offered him a contract anyway. Klein proposed a photographic journal of his return to New York; Liberman agreed Vogue would finance and publish it. But there was never much chance of that. Klein's attitude was diametrically opposed to the Cartier-Bresson school which insisted the photographer should never intrude or editorialise. Having felt excluded in his youth, Klein \"had a score to settle\" with New York. \"Coming back from Paris, I saw it as hicksville, not the brilliant Big Apple that New Yorkers thought it was.\" He decided to give it \"a kick in the balls\".</p> <p>The pictures were too strong for Vogue and Alexander Liberman, who suggested that Klein find another publisher. But no American house would touch New York: it was too grim, and would remain unpublished in the US for almost 40 years. Instead, it was published in Paris, and was an instant hit. Liberman next asked Klein to photograph the Paris collections for Vogue. According to the photography critic Martin Harrison, it was Klein who \"introduced wide-angle and long focal-length lenses, the use of open-flash, multiple exposures, and surrounded models with swirling auras of moving light\". He also used sets with distorted perspectives, creating surreal images that influenced the next generation of fashion photographers, in particular David Bailey and Helmut Newton. Nor was his innovation limited to technique. His view of women was challenging: he encouraged his models to play up for the camera rather than merely posing, and photographed top models with cigarettes hanging from their mouths,\"smoking like sailors\".</p> <p>This blunt street aesthetic gave fashion photography a new edge which, paradoxically, made it seem even more glamorous. His move into film-making was inevitable. On seeing New York, Federico Fellini invited the American to assist him on Notti di Cabiria. Soon afterwards, Klein returned to New York to shoot his first short, Broadway By Light, which Orson Welles described as \"the first film in which the colour is absolutely necessary\". It was full of Pop images, opening on a giant Pepsi Cola sign. For Klein, the film is a response to critics who said New York was too black, too dirty. \"I decided to do something very clean and beautiful, but just as frightening: the brain-washing electric lights and neon signs of Broadway . . . were ready-made movies.\"</p> <p>Broadway By Light prompted nouvelle vague director Louis Malle to enlist Klein as \"visual director\" for Zazie Dans Le Metro. Next, in 1962, came a fashion documentary, to be followed by Cassius, The Great.</p> <p>\"I didn't really know who Cassius Clay was. I just wanted to show America through a heavyweight championship fight. Ever since my childhood, I'd been fascinated by the way the whole country becomes polarised around this event.\" Fate conspired to his advantage; an advertising executive friend put up the money, and on the flight from New York to Miami he found himself sitting next to Malcolm X, who told him all about the fiery young boxer who had the whole country talking about him - and half of it hating him.</p> <p>\"It was amazing. Clay should have been the good guy - he was the Olympic champion, and Liston was a mob heavy who had been in prison. But Clay became the bad guy because he was saying things that made white America very uncomfortable. He was talking too loud, he was too cocky.\" Cassius works both as a riveting portrait of the young champion and as a document of the pre-Civil Rights era, featuring chilling interviews with the white Southern powerbrokers who managed Clay, talking about the young boxer as if he were a prize racehorse. Klein would later shoot an epilogue, the epic Foreman-Ali fight in Zaire, combining it with footage from Cassius to make Muhammad Ali, The Greatest 1964-1974.</p> <p>In 1965, Klein turned his sights on fashion and the media again with the corrosive spoof Who Are You Polly Maggoo? which follows the fortunes of a young American model in Paris. Comparable to the best of Luis Bu\u00f1uel, this surrealist satire on celebrity and the media anticipated the supermodel phenomenon by 25 years. Even today, Polly Maggoo remains the benchmark by which all other fashion films must be judged.</p> <p>In 1967, along with Resnais, Godard and Claude Lelouch, he contributed the American sequence to the anti-war film Far From Vietnam, which was greeted with outrage by the American right-wing press. Leading with his chin, Klein followed this with Mr Freedom, a feature-length political satire featuring a crypto-fascist Rambo-style superhero rampaging through a France in turmoil (Maoism was fashionable on the Left Bank at the time), to the accompaniment of a Serge Gainsbourg soundtrack. The French government, misreading the film as a portrait of the May 1968 uprisings, was incensed: Klein was summoned to the Ministry of the Interior, where he was told, \"Vous avez abus\u00e9 de l'hospitalit\u00e9 de la France,\" and threatened with expulsion. Mr Freedom was banned for nine months.</p> <p>Among his other films are his document of the political upheaval of May '68, Grands Soirs &amp; Petits Matins (which translates roughly as Revolutions And Hangovers) and a satire on social conditioning called Le Couple T'moin. Invited by the Algerian government to film the Pan-African Cultural Festival in 1969, Klein flew to Algiers and ran into Eldridge Cleaver, the black radical who had fled there to escape arrest by the FBI. Weary of the amateurish French documentary crew following him around, Cleaver asked Klein to take over.</p> <p>Filming was a \"crazy happening\", says Klein. The completed film, Eldridge Cleaver, Black Panther, was initially banned in France - on the pretext that Cleaver's profanities about Queen Victoria constituted \"an insult to a chief of state\". Klein became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in his adopted home: Roland Barthes wrote admiringly about his photography, Jean-Paul Sartre was among many intellectuals who signed a petition against the ban.</p> <p>Klein is a shy and painfully reserved man, according to his wife, Janine. They married as soon as he left the army, at the age of 20. The daughter of a Belgian architect who modelled to finance Klein's painting, she too has pursued an artist's life, collaborating and designing costumes for many of Klein's films, and generally playing an enormous role in his working life. Intriguingly, she once described her husband as \"someone who never really wants to reveal who he is. All the important people, he was never polite to them, even those he liked. Maybe to prove something . . . He shuts himself off, never talking about his own feelings. He hardly has any close friends. Maybe I'm the only one. He never played the game.\"</p> <p>This refusal to make the most of his contacts, along with an almost pathological inability to repeat himself, a satirical edge that borders on slapstick, and his anarchistic political stance - not to mention his haughty demeanour and occasional rudeness - all these factors have probably deprived Klein of his place in the pantheon of modern artists: a place that, for all his supposed indifference, he undoubtedly believes he has earned.</p> <p>Of course, he knows he is not a Picasso, but he likes to compare himself to Man Ray, and is not slow to point out parallels with another maverick who burned through more ideas in a decade than many of his peers managed in a lifetime. Neglected in his homeland for 40 years, Klein is keenly aware of how easily reputations are made or lost, and how critical recognition is often bestowed only after death - too late for the artist himself to benefit from his commercial resurrection. When I mention Easy Rider screenwriter Terry Southern he bristles: \"He was ripped off, poor guy, he should have had a career that was recognised . . .\" He pauses, before adding, \"For example, Andy Warhol gets so much credit for a lot stuff that isn't that revolutionary . . .\" The sentence trails off with a wave of the hand, but the implication is clear.</p> <p>Klein still makes a living from photographs he took nearly half a century ago, like the picture from New York of a small boy pointing a toy gun at the camera. Every few weeks, a magazine will call for the rights, usually to accompany a feature on juvenile crime.</p> <p>\"And you always let them use it?\"</p> <p>\"Well,\" he smiles,\"I'm in business.\"</p> <p>His affability remains intact as long as he's playing the patrician role. The wisecracking persona and couldn't-give-a-damn attitude evaporate when he's riled. A propos of nothing, he suddenly says of Paris-based designers Alexander McQueen and John Galliano, \"They're both doing quite well, but a lot of that is bullshit, you know . . . It's like kids of 20 years old who think they're inventing things that were originally done 100 years ago. And McQueen, half the stuff he does, he pulls it out of something that he's seen in the British Museum.\" The British Film Institute, having decided against a retrospective of Klein's films, is \"what you'd call a bunch of wankers\".</p> <p>Of course, he has done very well for himself, what with the apartment in the chic 6th arrondissement, three studios, a country house in the Loire, and retrospective exhibitions at major international museums. Yet there's the underlying sense that he feels cheated somehow, as mediocrities hog the limelight.</p> <p>Perhaps he can redress the balance with his latest film, The Messiah. Curiously, Klein is braced for a backlash: he expects some critics to dismiss it as a two-hour video clip. \"And that's true on one level, but it works on many levels, and there's a lot of suspense. It tells the story that Handel illustrated - the Nativity, Passion, and the Resurrection. It's just that it'll be a different story for every viewer.\"</p> <p>The room is suddenly ablaze with golden light, as the sun begins to set behind the trees outside. I unzip my bag, take out my latest purchase, and ask the big question.</p> <p>\"Will I take your photograph?\" he repeats, as if I had asked for money. For a second he fixes me with those unblinking eyes. Then he says,\"Yes, but don't move. The light's perfect.\"</p> <p>I hand him a plastic disposable camera. He turns it around in his big, ruddy hands, looking puzzled. \"What's this?\"</p> <p>I point out the viewfinder and the shutter release. He takes one, two, three, four snaps. The last, he mutters, is \"perfect\".</p> <p>The point is this: even when presented with the most primitive technology, William Klein cannot pass up the opportunity to forge an image. Perhaps this explains his curiously restless nature, his quixotic career, and his chronic inability to stroke even those biographers, curators, and journalists who - like me - arrive ready to write his hagiography and leave feeling bruised and belittled. Or perhaps it is simply that, having learned to paint with light, he must always move on, because the light is always changing.</p> <p>In the hallway, as I'm leaving, he asks if I ever met Man Ray. \"He used to live just around the corner from here,\" says Klein. \"I met him. He was very angry towards the end. Felt he'd been ripped off, and he was right. He died without a penny to his name. A shame.\"</p> <p>I don't have the heart to tell him about the trendy new restaurant that opened the night before, barely a mile from his apartment - a place designed for the new breed of instant celebrities he so brilliantly ridiculed in his films. The restaurant is called Man Ray</p>",

      "bodyText": "As a young man, he believed his eyes frightened people, and he was probably right. Even now they have an owl-like quality; pale-green, a little too alert, cold and unblinking. Age has crumpled and softened the rest of him. The jowls sag, there are liver spots on his broad forehead, but he remains sturdy and handsome, unbowed by his 71 years. He wears faded jeans, battered black Reeboks, a blood-red bandana tucked inside his sweater. He feels a bit stiff because he played tennis last night. The apartment is elegant and orderly, not plush. The living room, flooded with spring sunlight, looks out over the Jardin de Luxembourg. This has been home for half his life; he and his wife, Janine, raised their son Pierre here, and his office is upstairs. We sit at the marble coffee table under bookshelves stacked with monographs - painters, photographers, African and Oceanic art - and reams of literature, classic and modern. His New York idiom is dated, contorted by decades of speaking French, and his English vocabulary is rusty: at one point he growls, \"How do you say it now . . . people without jobs? Oh, yeah, unemployed.\" Thirty years ago, William Klein was famous, even infamous. True, he's still relatively well known in Paris, but elsewhere, those who recognise the name think of him as a photographer who did his best work in the 50s and 60s. A few cinema buffs will know him as the director of several ground-breaking films. In fact, he's much more than that. He says he wasn't really a photographer at all, and each of his four photographic monographs, on which much of his reputation is based, took an average of only three months to shoot, and a couple more for the design, typography, covers, text and layout - all of which he did himself. No, he sees himself as an multi-disciplinary avant-garde artist. Big shows in San Francisco, books flying out of the stores in Tokyo, that sort of thing. And certainly, over the past four-and-a-half decades he has moved freely between disciplines as diverse as abstract painting, graphic design, art and fashion photography, documentary and feature films, even TV commercials. His latest film is a quasi-documentary interpretation of Handel's Messiah. \"Beautiful, funny, tragic, scary, all at once,\" is his immodest description of a film depicting various amateur and ecclesiastical choirs in America, Russia, France and Spain performing the title work, as well as \"a lot of ordinary life\" - tattoo parlours, prisons, desert landscapes and political demonstrations. The Messiah, he says, is both homage to, and satire on, Handel's masterpiece. \"For example, Christmas dinner at a homeless refuge here in Paris was one of the most frightening things that you can imagine. And during that sequence, you have this beautiful black singer, Nicole Heaston, singing, 'Rejoice, rejoice . . .' \" If Klein has been pigeonholed as a photographer and image-maker, it is because, 43 years ago, his first book changed the theory and practice of photography. New York, or to give it its full title, Life Is Good And Good For You In New York: Trance Witness Revels, was published in Paris in 1956. Klein's black-and-white photographs - gritty, blurred, chaotic and violent, full of reflections, hidden detail and sweeping, geometric power - captured the social upheaval and consumerism of New York in the post-war era, but they went beyond social comment to celebrate a new language: Klein took the advertising slogans and logos of Coca-Cola, Philip Morris, Seven-Up, Esso, Hoover, Lucky Strike and Wonder Bread, and created the first alphabet of Pop Art. The book also had a 16-page pull-out brochure parodying the Daily News, with stunted headlines and classified ads for hypnotism and body-building courses, and a tin of Franco-American Spaghetti - a precursor of the Campbell's Soup paintings that would make Warhol a household name. Even the text clearly anticipated Warhol's deadpan assertion that success and popularity were the supreme artistic criteria. \"Let us Praise the Dollar,\" wrote Klein, \"the most beautiful, the most exciting, the most important thing in New York, its coat of arms, the 13th sign of its zodiac, the fifth element . . . The masterpieces of American culture are skyscrapers, gangster films, westerns, animated cartoons . . . advertising, Marilyn Monroe, Broadway at night, television. The $ is a means of expression, and the artists who have learned to work in this medium, who can produce money-making masterpieces, will become the real American Artists. And the day when Ugliness shall no longer profit will be Their Day, beauty will fill the banks, beauty will be a commodity, only beauty will sell, then shall dawn the Age Of The Beautiful Dollar and everything will be just gorgeous.\" As a visionary manifesto for Pop Art, published six years before the fact, New York was astonishingly prescient. At the time, remember, Warhol was still a young hack illustrator, sketching shoe ads and frocks for Harper's Bazaar. Klein has continued in a similar vein ever since, tracing a mercurial and sometimes brilliant trajectory through the visual arts of the late 20th century. Of course, he should be famous - or at least more famous. Though born into a petit-bourgeois orthodox Jewish family in 1928, Klein grew up poor, his father having lost everything in the Wall Street Crash, and the household moving to progressively rougher neighbourhoods.

Next, in 1962, came a fashion documentary, to be followed by Cassius, The Great. \"I didn't really know who Cassius Clay was. I just wanted to show America through a heavyweight championship fight. Ever since my childhood, I'd been fascinated by the way the whole country becomes polarised around this event.\" Fate conspired to his advantage; an advertising executive friend put up the money, and on the flight from New York to Miami he found himself sitting next to Malcolm X, who told him all about the fiery young boxer who had the whole country talking about him - and half of it hating him. \"It was amazing.

Klein would later shoot an epilogue, the epic Foreman-Ali fight in Zaire, combining it with footage from Cassius to make Muhammad Ali, The Greatest 1964-1974. In 1965, Klein turned his sights on fashion and the media again with the corrosive spoof Who Are You Polly Maggoo? which follows the fortunes of a young American model in Paris.

Mr Freedom was banned for nine months. Among his other films are his document of the political upheaval of May '68, Grands Soirs &amp; Petits Matins (which translates roughly as Revolutions And Hangovers) and a satire on social conditioning called Le Couple T'moin. Invited by the Algerian government to film the Pan-African Cultural Festival in 1969, Klein flew to Algiers and ran into Eldridge Cleaver, the black radical who had fled there to escape arrest by the FBI. Weary of the amateurish French documentary crew following him around, Cleaver asked Klein to take over. Filming was a \"crazy happening\", says Klein.

      "body": "<p>Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery since 1988, is the most powerful figure in the history of modern art in Britain, at a time when contemporary art has never been more culturally centre stage. Gallery visitor figures are on a spectacularly rising curve and press and public interest has never been greater. Serota chairs the judges for the Turner Prize and has become inextricably linked to its annual cavalcade of dead sharks, unmade beds and the accompanying controversy. It has become a major annual fixture that every year swells the audience for modern art while simultaneously providing ammunition for sceptics to fulminate about its waste and absurdity. </p> <p>Next month sees the culmination of Serota's career so far with the opening of Tate Modern, the vast new \u00a3130m temple to contemporary art at Bankside. It joins Tate Britain - the new name for the original gallery on Millbank - Tate Liverpool, and Tate St Ives as part of the most comprehensive presentation of modern art ever seen in this country. </p> <p>Having worked for 30 years at that explosive junction where public money meets contemporary art, Serota has become accustomed to operating under heavy bombardment. But more recently it has begun to seem that he can do no wrong. Unlike the fiascos of other millennium projects, Bankside is on time, within budget and Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Mueron's stunning conversion of Giles Gilbert Scott's power station on the south side of the Thames is getting rave reviews. So perhaps now comes the really difficult part for Serota. In an unorthodox development it seems that traditional British cynicism has given way to naked enthusiasm. The expectations of Bankside couldn't be higher. </p> <p>\"It is an enormously important moment\", says Culture Secretary Chris Smith. \"This is the first major new gallery to open in this country in over 100 years and it is also a landmark piece of architecture. It will mean that London and the UK have for the first time a world-class contemporary art gallery.\" The artist and influential art teacher Michael Craig Martin makes an even larger claim. \"It is difficult to overstate its importance. There has always been a hesitancy about modernism throughout this century in Britain. This building announces that the hesitancy is over.\" </p> <p>Glen Lowry is director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, traditionally seen as the world leader in contemporary art. Even he acknowledges that Tate Modern, \"has vaulted Britain to the forefront of the international art scene. We are all looking forward to it with incredible interest and anticipation, but of course ultimately the displays and programming will decide its true impact.\" </p> <p>So Serota, having already achieved so much, will remain under scrutiny for some time yet. There are few who doubt he has the artistic vision and mental toughness to succeed. He is variously described as \"intense\", \"cold\" and \"unnervingly inscrutable\". The Turner prize-winning artist Gillian Wearing, recently made a trustee of the Tate, says Serota's position and reputation make him an intimidating man to meet. \"He's the overseer of everything, isn't he?\" </p> <p>His ascetic demeanour, along with a taste for understated dark suits and white shirts, prompted one gallery owner to describe him as, \"a Jansenist dressed by Comme des Gar\u00e7ons\". But while he is undoubtedly a formidable man to do business with and a world-class political and administrative operator, the question remains - with the global surge in interest in contemporary art over the last decade - whether Bankside would ever have happened if Nick Serota had never been involved. </p> <p>Chris Smith thinks not. \"Probably more than anyone it was his idea that Bankside could be transformed into something special, and he has been very much the driving force. Without him there would have been a serious question as to whether it happened at all.\" Norman Rosenthal, exhibitions secretary at the Royal Academy agrees. \"The moment finds the man and the man finds the moment. And Nick has very much been a man for this particular moment.\" Rosenthal says that Tate Modern will permanently alter \"the cultural ecology of London\". </p> <p>Shaping the body politic of London seems to be in the blood. Serota was born in 1946 in middle-class Hampstead to Stanley and Beatrice Serota. He has one sister, Judith, two years younger, who is festival manager of the Spitalfields arts festival in east London. His father was a civil engineer. His mother was a leading Labour Party figure in local government. After serving on Hampstead Borough Council and the London County Council, where she chaired the education committee, in 1967 she became a life peer and served as a minister of state at the department of health in Harold Wilson's government. Later she became deputy speaker of the Lords and a governor of the BBC. </p> <p>Serota recalls a few cabinet ministers coming in and out of the house but says his mother was never at the heart of the Labour Party in that sense, \"although she was active in the Hampstead party in the 50s, so she did know people like Gaitskell and Greenwood\". </p> <p>The family is Jewish and the name Russian but Serota says his aunts and uncles were far more observant on religion than his parents. \"But just because they weren't observant doesn't mean they didn't feel part of the Jewish community. My parents respected rather than actively observed Jewishness.\" He adopts the same approach. </p> <p>After attending the local primary school Serota won an LCC scholarship to the direct grant Haberdashers Askes. He was made head boy and captained the first XV rugby team. \"I was a forward, although I don't look like one now.\" He says he wasn't engaged in the arts at school but was more interested in social and political questions. He never joined the Labour Party but did go on a few Alder maston anti-nuclear marches and thought he would probably end up working somewhere in social administration. </p> <p>His parents were not academically pushy but he says they were \"surprised\" when, at Cambridge University, after a gap year in India, he changed his course from economics to history of art. The family had occasionally visited galleries but there was no strong visual presence in the home, apart from a few reproductions of paintings by Christopher Wood, several of whose colourful depictions of inter-war provincial France are in the Tate collection. \"I think I decided that if I wasn't going to be a great economist, I might as well spend two years learning about something that would stay with me for the rest of my life. Once I started, it felt natural to be doing it.\" </p> <p>In the early 60s Serota saw exhibitions of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg at the Whitechapel Gallery, but says if there was a moment when he decided that he was interested in the visual arts it was after seeing a big survey show of European and American art at the Tate in 1964 called Painting and Sculpture of the Decade. \"I saw British artists in an international context. It didn't feel like little England.\" His main enthusiasm remained 20th century art, but at Cambridge he mostly studied the Italian renaissance. So, after university, he spent a year in France doing a series of hand-to-mouth jobs, and self-consciously catching up on the 18th and 19th centuries to reinforce his interest in the modern. </p> <p>When he returned from France, Serota took an MA at the Courtauld Institute. He was taught by Anita Brookner - \"an incredible teacher, really brilliant\" - and wrote his thesis on Turner in Switzerland. He then applied to the Arts Council for a job as a garden technician at the recently opened Serpentine Gallery but was turned down for being over qualified. He was, however, offered another job - looking after the grants made to artists and managing exhibitions touring around the country. His patch was the north east, which extended from Southend to Berwick - \"It was a very metropolitan view,\" he says, \"but it was a really good job.\" His predecessor at the Tate, Alan Bowness, had done the same job 15 years earlier. </p> <p>Serota began to learn the business of arts administration. Michael Craig Martin first met him at this time and remembers him as serious, shy and quiet - \"although his essential shyness is often taken for coldness, when in fact he has a very wry humour\" - but always very well informed. Serota identifies a key moment in 1970 when he worked with the art critic and curator David Sylvester on putting together an exhibition of Mir\u00f3 sculpture at the Hayward Gallery. \"I learned a huge amount in about 48 hours; how you deal with works of art, how you install it and make exhibitions,\" says Serota. Sylvester remembers thinking even then that, \"one day this man will be director of the Tate. And he has been the best director the Tate has ever had. Both in terms of his acquisitions and his presentations.\" </p> <p>Serota's taste was forged at this time. \"We can now see it was a pretty key moment in the development of art in the 20th century,\" he says. \"People like Richard Long and Bruce McLean in this country and Carl Andr\u00e9 and Joseph Beuys and others overseas were making art that was more conceptually based and directly related to things in life around them. It was everything Brian Sewell hates and it was new and challenging and felt very much of the moment.\" </p> <p>It is this type of art that he has most closely been associated with and he acknowledges that, \"you come into contact with contemporary art at a certain moment in your life and that art and those groups of artists remain important to you. The question is then whether you can move forward and engage with other types of art. I think my taste has become much more catholic than many people might believe. I'm certainly more interested in a wider range of contemporary art than I was in the 70s.\" </p> <p>He was criticised not long after joining the Tate for spending \u00a3700,000 on a Joseph Beuys installation of rocks with felt-lined sockets. But he also bought paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby and Gainsborough, along with more mainstream modern painters like Freud, Heron and Kitaj. </p> <p>The Courtauld lecturer Julian Stallabrass feels that the Tate's buying policy can be too conservative. \"They tend to deal with a small number of established dealers and they stick to works that has received endorsement from the commercial sector first. It is not a leader. I think it could be a bit more pro-active in helping to set trends as well as follow them.\" Serota counters by saying the Tate does buy early. \"We rarely go into a studio and buy works by artists who have not had commercial shows of any kind. But we do buy early and sometimes get very good margins. For instance in 1993 we bought a work by an American artist called Matthew Barney for $30,000 which is probably worth close to $500,000 now.\" </p> <p>In 1973 Serota was given his first director's job when he was asked to run the Oxford Museum of Modern Art. Despite the small budget he set out to create a programme that had some international dimension, and he formed a series of alliances with similar small galleries in the Netherlands and in Germany and began to exchange work. </p> <p>He got married the same year to the ballet dancer Angela Beveridge. They have two daughters, Anya, 24, who works on the online edition of the Macmillan Dictionary of Art and Beth, 23, at Edinburgh University studying sociology and anthropology. The marriage broke up in 1993. Serota married Teresa Gleadowe, a friend from Cambridge and former head of information at the Tate, in 1997. Gleadowe, who has two daughters, is director of the MA course in curating and visual arts administration at the Royal College of Art. </p> <p> After three years in Oxford he moved to the Whitechapel Gallery. Joanna Drew, who as director of art at the Arts Council has nurtured a whole generation of gallery curators, remembers him as a brilliant figure in a very bright generation. \"When he went to Oxford he put the whole museum on its feet. It was struggling and he established the nature of the place and its pro gramme. He had the same effect on the Whitechapel. He was associated with minimalism but he also put on a remarkable exhibition of Max Beckmann and one on Hawksmoor. He re-established its credibility as a serious venue for serious exhibitions.\" </p> <p>Under Bryan Robertson's regime in the 50s and 60s, Whitechapel had been the premier gallery for showing contemporary art in Britain. By the time Serota arrived it was suffering the consequences of a turf war between the Hayward, the Tate and the ICA, its grant had been cut and it had had three directors in five years. Serota, however, saw a sleeping giant, particularly as it was so well placed to tap into the geographical shift of artists moving to east London. One of the first things he did was appoint a community education worker who promoted contact with local schools and hospitals, a revolutionary appointment in those days, and began to attract a new audience to the gallery. </p> <p>He staged some extremely controversial shows featuring work by Baselitz, Richard Long and, in 1978, Carl Andr\u00e9. The Tate had been vilified for acquiring Andr\u00e9's sculpture, Equivalent VIII, two years earlier, when the neatly arranged collection of bricks became a by-word for the absurdity of modern art. \"That was one of the reasons for doing an Andr\u00e9 show,\" he says. \"I didn't think he had been given a fair crack of the whip after the Tate bricks row.\" </p> <p>By the time the Tate job became vacant in 1988, Serota was the obvious candidate. Michael Craig Martin says, \"from the minute he arrived he did two things that were significant. He physically transformed the gallery by stripping the building back to its original architectural framework. And then he completely reorganised the hanging of the collection. Those two acts carry over to what you will see in Bankside.\" </p> <p>Denis Stevenson, chair of the trustees throughout most of the 90s, says people don't remember how contentious re-hanging the collection was. Rodin's The Thinker was removed, and hasn't been seen since, as were other favourites. \"The first re-hang was extraordinarily controversial. Rather like the re-hang at Millbank is now. But it was clearly strategically correct. The audience doubled. You don't go back to the cinema to see the same film every week, and it's the same with paintings.\" </p> <p>Having worked for nearly 20 years on temporary exhibitions Serota was relishing the opportunities offered by the Tate. Since he arrived, visitor numbers have increased from 1.1m to 2.6m a year. It is anticipated that Tate Modern will attract 2m visitors on its own. \"The moments when the Tate has authority in the contemporary world is when it is respected by artists, putting on interesting shows and buying good work,\" he says. \"I wanted to create one of those moment. I was also increasingly interested in building a collection.\" </p> <p>He remembers that when he arrived, people at the Tate were apprehensive because he had never run an organisation with more than 20 people. \"Looking back I can see why they were apprehensive.\" Stevenson, also chairman of Pearson and the Halifax, says Serota is a natural: \"he is the manager from central casting. He has natural authority and can just do it. If he wanted to and was available, I wouldn't hesitate to give him a great chunk of Pearson or the Halifax.\" </p> <p>Serota says he wasn't apprehensive in artistic terms. \"Not because I thought I was infallible, but I had become used to making choices and statements through the art I showed. I knew I would be criticised and occasionally praised but I had served an apprenticeship in being roasted by the press and by artists and sometimes by other colleagues. It doesn't mean that you are impervious to criticism, but you get used to the notion that you can't please all the people all the time.\" </p> <p>His most persistent critic has been Brian Sewell who used a show held last year, Abracadabra, to illustrate all that is wrong with Serota's Tate. \"It was a prime example of the hocus-pocus and mumbo jumbo by which the false intellectuals of the art world are able to 'hey presto!' anything into art, be it the dung of elephants, the video of a medical camera's examination of an artist's uterus, anus and digestive tract, an erect cucumber projecting from a stained mattress, or a dead horse suspended from a dome.\" </p> <p>In calling for Serota to be sacked he said that, \"the curators of this exhibition know nothing of empathy, catharsis or the elevation of the spirit, nothing of intellectual nourishment, nothing of awe and wonder, nothing of what is to be derived from, for example, the great Titians in the National Gallery.\" </p> <p>The director of the National Gallery, Neil MacGregor, may agree with Sewell about the glory of Titian, but he is also a firm supporter of Serota. MacGregor sees Serota's key achievement as at last solving the historical compromise of the Tate. The gallery was founded by sugar magnate Henry Tate in 1897 as The National Gallery of British Art. Following a major bequest of modern French art in 1916, including many important impressionist paintings, it formally took on the remit for international modern art the following year. </p> <p>\"The huge task at the Tate was always to clarify that split,\" says MacGregor. \"Nick's achievement has been a lucidity of analysis in sorting out the different roles and then an astonishing capacity to make it a reality. London will benefit from the huge gain in clarity. Everyone will know where the 20th century collection is.\" In making the split Serota has been conscious that Tate Britain might be overshadowed by its bright new sister space. Symbolically he has decided to keep his office at Millbank and the annual Turner Prize show will still be based there. </p> <p>The prize has been the single most significant element in raising the profile of contemporary art in Britain. It was founded in 1984 but by 1990 it was dead on its feet and was suspended. Five of the first six winners had appeared on the very first shortlist and the public had lost interest. In 1991 Channel 4 stepped in and the prize was limited to artists under 50. \"Which meant it was on live television and artists in their 30s started to win it,\" recalls Michael Craig Martin. \"Now a young audience thinks of contemporary art in the same way as previous generations thought about the cinema, the theatre or literature. Art has become another central component of cultural life.\" </p> <p>But Serota knows that simply basing the prize at Millbank won't in itself generate interest in Tate Britain. \"I do need to give some tender loving care to a few places that have missed out over the last year or so. They will get it. The challenge now is make Tate Britain a place where British artists really want to see their work shown.\" </p> <p>Turner prize short-listed artist Cornelia Parker will have a piece of her work in the opening collection at Tate Modern but is enthusiastic about Tate Britain. \"Now is a good time to change how we think about Britain and the idea that there will be a museum for art made in Britain reflects the confidence and changes in British art over the last decade or so. It will show how British art is not such an exclusive club any more.\" </p> <p>As part of the effort to balance the different arms of the Tate, each gallery has its own director. Stephen Deuchar, formally at the National Maritime Museum, is in charge at Tate Britain and the Swedish curator Lars Nittve will run Tate Modern. One industry observer notes that, \"Serota has a reputation for wanting to control things and there are potential problems with the two directors beneath him. When looking at Bankside one of the most interesting things will be to see how much Serota allows the new director to do the work and who will make the big decisions. Intellectually I'm sure he wants to allow the two directors a reasonable degree of latitude. But I suspect in practice the temptation of wanting to control things will continue. After all it was his idea and he raised the money.\" </p> <p>Serota says his job is to, \"encourage, support and act as a second pair of eyes. But I would find it difficult to walk away from the hands-on side of the job and not be directly involved. In the last few weeks I have spent some time hanging works at Tate Modern with Lars. But clearly it is his gallery.\" </p> <p>In fact one of Serota's triumphs has been how few rows he has had despite pushing the organisation so quickly forward. The history of the Tate is littered with stories of carnage as directors and trustees continually fell out. But in Serota's time there seem to have been remarkably few rows. He laughs that there were bad periods in the 50s, the late 70s and the mid 80s. \"So we're just about due for another one now.\" A former member of staff confirms the effectiveness of his personal skills. \"Quite often major donors want to impose conditions on gifts. Nick is very good at finessing things so that they fit in with the Tate's strategy. And he uses his aura and mystique to add to the attractiveness. Equally he is very approachable to his staff, and you don't need to pussyfoot around him.\" </p> <p>People close to him say that his apparently buttoned up on-duty persona is only part of the story. His Who's Who entry used to rather depressingly list his recreation as \"hanging paintings\". Now it makes no mention of recreation at all, but he enjoys sailing dinghies and there are stories of him as an energetic dancer at the office party - with a fondness for the music of Little Richard. He says that while he works hard, he's no workaholic. \"I still take holidays, I have a few friends. I tremendously enjoy the company of artists,\" he laughs. \"I have spent my working life working with them and I wouldn't be in this job if it didn't include talking about art and talking to artists.\" </p> <p>This feeds into an evangelical enthusiasm for what galleries can do. \"Here is something that by its very nature should be interesting to huge numbers of people and we want to make it available to them. But in the end there is little point in encouraging people to come to the Tate unless they find something that interests them or irritates them or that they find beautiful. It's not a question of liking everything. I don't like everything in the Tate. </p> <p>\"But it's not an industry. It's a form of educational experience and of self discovery. It's the reason one can justify using taxpayers money to support and sustain a great institution.\" People speak of Serota's sense of moral duty in accounting for the way public money is spent. He has been a passionate advocate of increased accessibility and a recently announced joint web-site project with New York's Museum of Modern Art is part of that agenda. He has also been prominent in the campaign to reject admission charges to museums. </p> <p>Neil MacGregor says Serota's role in changing the perception of modern art has been enormous. \"He has made it into something that a very large number of people are interested in and want to come and look at. It is no longer a minority or fringe interest. And that is true right across the country. I suspect he has played the leading part in that. He has almost stopped Britain being afraid of contemporary art.\" </p> <p>The \"almost\" is important. As chairman of the Turner prize judges, Serota is well aware that annual displays of outrage at the shortlist and periodic personal attacks on him are a sign that there remains much more hand-holding of the public to be done. \"Occasionally I get irritated with the criticism,\" he says, \"but I probably also have myself to blame for being seen as someone who will support new developments in contemporary art. If you do that you will be regarded as only being interested in those things. But that's the life of the director of the Tate. I've got no complaints.\" </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance</strong></p> <p><strong> Nicholas Andrew Serota </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> April 27 1946, London.</p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Haberdasher's Aske's school; Christ's College, Cambridge; Courtauld Institute.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Married: </strong> 1973 Angela Beveridge (two daughters, Anya and Beth), divorced 1995; 1997 Teresa Gleadowe.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Career: </strong> Exhibition director,<strong> </strong> Arts Council1970-73; director, Oxford Museum of Modern Art 1973-76; director, Whitechapel Art Gallery 1976-88; director, Tate Gallery 1988-. </p> <p><strong> Other posts: </strong> member, visual arts advisory committee of the British Council 1976-98, chairman 1992-98; trustee, Architecture Foundation 1991-99; Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. <strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Publications: </strong> 1997, Walter Neurath Lecture, Experience or Interpretation; The Dilemma of Museums of Modern Art. </p> <p><strong> Honours: </strong> Knighted in 1999; honorary fellow, Royal Institute of British Architects, 1992.<strong> </strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Tate Modern opens on May 12</p>",

The family is Jewish and the name Russian but Serota says his aunts and uncles were far more observant on religion than his parents. \"But just because they weren't observant doesn't mean they didn't feel part of the Jewish community.

So, after university, he spent a year in France doing a series of hand-to-mouth jobs, and self-consciously catching up on the 18th and 19th centuries to reinforce his interest in the modern. When he returned from France, Serota took an MA at the Courtauld Institute. He was taught by Anita Brookner - \"an incredible teacher, really brilliant\" - and wrote his thesis on Turner in Switzerland. He then applied to the Arts Council for a job as a garden technician at the recently opened Serpentine Gallery but was turned down for being over qualified. He was, however, offered another job - looking after the grants made to artists and managing exhibitions touring around the country. His patch was the north east, which extended from Southend to Berwick - \"It was a very metropolitan view,\" he says, \"but it was a really good job.\" His predecessor at the Tate, Alan Bowness, had done the same job 15 years earlier. Serota began to learn the business of arts administration. Michael Craig Martin first met him at this time and remembers him as serious, shy and quiet - \"although his essential shyness is often taken for coldness, when in fact he has a very wry humour\" - but always very well informed. Serota identifies a key moment in 1970 when he worked with the art critic and curator David Sylvester on putting together an exhibition of Mir\u00f3 sculpture at the Hayward Gallery. \"I learned a huge amount in about 48 hours; how you deal with works of art, how you install it and make exhibitions,\" says Serota. Sylvester remembers thinking even then that, \"one day this man will be director of the Tate. And he has been the best director the Tate has ever had. Both in terms of his acquisitions and his presentations.\" Serota's taste was forged at this time. \"We can now see it was a pretty key moment in the development of art in the 20th century,\" he says. \"People like Richard Long and Bruce McLean in this country and Carl Andr\u00e9 and Joseph Beuys and others overseas were making art that was more conceptually based and directly related to things in life around them. It was everything Brian Sewell hates and it was new and challenging and felt very much of the moment.\" It is this type of art that he has most closely been associated with and he acknowledges that, \"you come into contact with contemporary art at a certain moment in your life and that art and those groups of artists remain important to you. The question is then whether you can move forward and engage with other types of art. I think my taste has become much more catholic than many people might believe. I'm certainly more interested in a wider range of contemporary art than I was in the 70s.\" He was criticised not long after joining the Tate for spending \u00a3700,000 on a Joseph Beuys installation of rocks with felt-lined sockets. But he also bought paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby and Gainsborough, along with more mainstream modern painters like Freud, Heron and Kitaj. The Courtauld lecturer Julian Stallabrass feels that the Tate's buying policy can be too conservative. \"They tend to deal with a small number of established dealers and they stick to works that has received endorsement from the commercial sector first. It is not a leader. I think it could be a bit more pro-active in helping to set trends as well as follow them.\" Serota counters by saying the Tate does buy early. \"We rarely go into a studio and buy works by artists who have not had commercial shows of any kind. But we do buy early and sometimes get very good margins. For instance in 1993 we bought a work by an American artist called Matthew Barney for $30,000 which is probably worth close to $500,000 now.\" In 1973 Serota was given his first director's job when he was asked to run the Oxford Museum of Modern Art. Despite the small budget he set out to create a programme that had some international dimension, and he formed a series of alliances with similar small galleries in the Netherlands and in Germany and began to exchange work. He got married the same year to the ballet dancer Angela Beveridge. They have two daughters, Anya, 24, who works on the online edition of the Macmillan Dictionary of Art and Beth, 23, at Edinburgh University studying sociology and anthropology. The marriage broke up in 1993. Serota married Teresa Gleadowe, a friend from Cambridge and former head of information at the Tate, in 1997. Gleadowe, who has two daughters, is director of the MA course in curating and visual arts administration at the Royal College of Art. After three years in Oxford he moved to the Whitechapel Gallery. Joanna Drew, who as director of art at the Arts Council has nurtured a whole generation of gallery curators, remembers him as a brilliant figure in a very bright generation. \"When he went to Oxford he put the whole museum on its feet. It was struggling and he established the nature of the place and its pro gramme. He had the same effect on the Whitechapel. He was associated with minimalism but he also put on a remarkable exhibition of Max Beckmann and one on Hawksmoor. He re-established its credibility as a serious venue for serious exhibitions.\" Under Bryan Robertson's regime in the 50s and 60s, Whitechapel had been the premier gallery for showing contemporary art in Britain. By the time Serota arrived it was suffering the consequences of a turf war between the Hayward, the Tate and the ICA, its grant had been cut and it had had three directors in five years. Serota, however, saw a sleeping giant, particularly as it was so well placed to tap into the geographical shift of artists moving to east London. One of the first things he did was appoint a community education worker who promoted contact with local schools and hospitals, a revolutionary appointment in those days, and began to attract a new audience to the gallery. He staged some extremely controversial shows featuring work by Baselitz, Richard Long and, in 1978, Carl Andr\u00e9. The Tate had been vilified for acquiring Andr\u00e9's sculpture, Equivalent VIII, two years earlier, when the neatly arranged collection of bricks became a by-word for the absurdity of modern art. \"That was one of the reasons for doing an Andr\u00e9 show,\" he says. \"I didn't think he had been given a fair crack of the whip after the Tate bricks row.\" By the time the Tate job became vacant in 1988, Serota was the obvious candidate. Michael Craig Martin says, \"from the minute he arrived he did two things that were significant. He physically transformed the gallery by stripping the building back to its original architectural framework. And then he completely reorganised the hanging of the collection. Those two acts carry over to what you will see in Bankside.\" Denis Stevenson, chair of the trustees throughout most of the 90s, says people don't remember how contentious re-hanging the collection was. Rodin's The Thinker was removed, and hasn't been seen since, as were other favourites. \"The first re-hang was extraordinarily controversial. Rather like the re-hang at Millbank is now. But it was clearly strategically correct. The audience doubled. You don't go back to the cinema to see the same film every week, and it's the same with paintings.\" Having worked for nearly 20 years on temporary exhibitions Serota was relishing the opportunities offered by the Tate. Since he arrived, visitor numbers have increased from 1.1m to 2.6m a year. It is anticipated that Tate Modern will attract 2m visitors on its own. \"The moments when the Tate has authority in the contemporary world is when it is respected by artists, putting on interesting shows and buying good work,\" he says. \"I wanted to create one of those moment. I was also increasingly interested in building a collection.\" He remembers that when he arrived, people at the Tate were apprehensive because he had never run an organisation with more than 20 people. \"Looking back I can see why they were apprehensive.\" Stevenson, also chairman of Pearson and the Halifax, says Serota is a natural: \"he is the manager from central casting. He has natural authority and can just do it. If he wanted to and was available, I wouldn't hesitate to give him a great chunk of Pearson or the Halifax.\" Serota says he wasn't apprehensive in artistic terms. \"Not because I thought I was infallible, but I had become used to making choices and statements through the art I showed. I knew I would be criticised and occasionally praised but I had served an apprenticeship in being roasted by the press and by artists and sometimes by other colleagues. It doesn't mean that you are impervious to criticism, but you get used to the notion that you can't please all the people all the time.\" His most persistent critic has been Brian Sewell who used a show held last year, Abracadabra, to illustrate all that is wrong with Serota's Tate. \"It was a prime example of the hocus-pocus and mumbo jumbo by which the false intellectuals of the art world are able to 'hey presto!' anything into art, be it the dung of elephants, the video of a medical camera's examination of an artist's uterus, anus and digestive tract, an erect cucumber projecting from a stained mattress, or a dead horse suspended from a dome.\" In calling for Serota to be sacked he said that, \"the curators of this exhibition know nothing of empathy, catharsis or the elevation of the spirit, nothing of intellectual nourishment, nothing of awe and wonder, nothing of what is to be derived from, for example, the great Titians in the National Gallery.\" The director of the National Gallery, Neil MacGregor, may agree with Sewell about the glory of Titian, but he is also a firm supporter of Serota. MacGregor sees Serota's key achievement as at last solving the historical compromise of the Tate. The gallery was founded by sugar magnate Henry Tate in 1897 as The National Gallery of British Art. Following a major bequest of modern French art in 1916, including many important impressionist paintings, it formally took on the remit for international modern art the following year. \"The huge task at the Tate was always to clarify that split,\" says MacGregor. \"Nick's achievement has been a lucidity of analysis in sorting out the different roles and then an astonishing capacity to make it a reality. London will benefit from the huge gain in clarity. Everyone will know where the 20th century collection is.\" In making the split Serota has been conscious that Tate Britain might be overshadowed by its bright new sister space. Symbolically he has decided to keep his office at Millbank and the annual Turner Prize show will still be based there. The prize has been the single most significant element in raising the profile of contemporary art in Britain. It was founded in 1984 but by 1990 it was dead on its feet and was suspended. Five of the first six winners had appeared on the very first shortlist and the public had lost interest. In 1991 Channel 4 stepped in and the prize was limited to artists under 50. \"Which meant it was on live television and artists in their 30s started to win it,\" recalls Michael Craig Martin. \"Now a young audience thinks of contemporary art in the same way as previous generations thought about the cinema, the theatre or literature. Art has become another central component of cultural life.\" But Serota knows that simply basing the prize at Millbank won't in itself generate interest in Tate Britain. \"I do need to give some tender loving care to a few places that have missed out over the last year or so. They will get it. The challenge now is make Tate Britain a place where British artists really want to see their work shown.\" Turner prize short-listed artist Cornelia Parker will have a piece of her work in the opening collection at Tate Modern but is enthusiastic about Tate Britain. \"Now is a good time to change how we think about Britain and the idea that there will be a museum for art made in Britain reflects the confidence and changes in British art over the last decade or so. It will show how British art is not such an exclusive club any more.\" As part of the effort to balance the different arms of the Tate, each gallery has its own director. Stephen Deuchar, formally at the National Maritime Museum, is in charge at Tate Britain and the Swedish curator Lars Nittve will run Tate Modern. One industry observer notes that, \"Serota has a reputation for wanting to control things and there are potential problems with the two directors beneath him. When looking at Bankside one of the most interesting things will be to see how much Serota allows the new director to do the work and who will make the big decisions. Intellectually I'm sure he wants to allow the two directors a reasonable degree of latitude. But I suspect in practice the temptation of wanting to control things will continue. After all it was his idea and he raised the money.\" Serota says his job is to, \"encourage, support and act as a second pair of eyes. But I would find it difficult to walk away from the hands-on side of the job and not be directly involved. In the last few weeks I have spent some time hanging works at Tate Modern with Lars. But clearly it is his gallery.\" In fact one of Serota's triumphs has been how few rows he has had despite pushing the organisation so quickly forward. The history of the Tate is littered with stories of carnage as directors and trustees continually fell out. But in Serota's time there seem to have been remarkably few rows. He laughs that there were bad periods in the 50s, the late 70s and the mid 80s. \"So we're just about due for another one now.\" A former member of staff confirms the effectiveness of his personal skills. \"Quite often major donors want to impose conditions on gifts. Nick is very good at finessing things so that they fit in with the Tate's strategy. And he uses his aura and mystique to add to the attractiveness. Equally he is very approachable to his staff, and you don't need to pussyfoot around him.\" People close to him say that his apparently buttoned up on-duty persona is only part of the story. His Who's Who entry used to rather depressingly list his recreation as \"hanging paintings\". Now it makes no mention of recreation at all, but he enjoys sailing dinghies and there are stories of him as an energetic dancer at the office party - with a fondness for the music of Little Richard. He says that while he works hard, he's no workaholic. \"I still take holidays, I have a few friends. I tremendously enjoy the company of artists,\" he laughs. \"I have spent my working life working with them and I wouldn't be in this job if it didn't include talking about art and talking to artists.\" This feeds into an evangelical enthusiasm for what galleries can do. \"Here is something that by its very nature should be interesting to huge numbers of people and we want to make it available to them. But in the end there is little point in encouraging people to come to the Tate unless they find something that interests them or irritates them or that they find beautiful. It's not a question of liking everything. I don't like everything in the Tate. \"But it's not an industry. It's a form of educational experience and of self discovery. It's the reason one can justify using taxpayers money to support and sustain a great institution.\" People speak of Serota's sense of moral duty in accounting for the way public money is spent. He has been a passionate advocate of increased accessibility and a recently announced joint web-site project with New York's Museum of Modern Art is part of that agenda. He has also been prominent in the campaign to reject admission charges to museums. Neil MacGregor says Serota's role in changing the perception of modern art has been enormous. \"He has made it into something that a very large number of people are interested in and want to come and look at. It is no longer a minority or fringe interest. And that is true right across the country. I suspect he has played the leading part in that. He has almost stopped Britain being afraid of contemporary art.\" The \"almost\" is important. As chairman of the Turner prize judges, Serota is well aware that annual displays of outrage at the shortlist and periodic personal attacks on him are a sign that there remains much more hand-holding of the public to be done. \"Occasionally I get irritated with the criticism,\" he says, \"but I probably also have myself to blame for being seen as someone who will support new developments in contemporary art. If you do that you will be regarded as only being interested in those things. But that's the life of the director of the Tate. I've got no complaints.\" Life at a glance Nicholas Andrew Serota Born: April 27 1946, London. Education: Haberdasher's Aske's school; Christ's College, Cambridge; Courtauld Institute.

Of no natural phenomenon is this truer than of the sea, that eternal metaphor for psychological isolation and self-reliance. Seafaring is what happens to the human soul when it cuts itself free of the moorings of society and its stabilising codes of permitted behaviour. Out there, upon a wilderness of ocean, the human psyche makes a reckoning with its own essential loneliness. </p> <p>All the great sailors of literature - from Odysseus and the Anglo-Saxon Seafarer to Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, Melville's Ahab, Tennyson's Ulysses and Conrad's Lord Jim - are fleeing insanity, yet heading into it at the same time. The sea, eternally changing and eternally the same, reflects back at them some circularity in their own nature, a longing for fulfilment which recedes further the more they try to achieve it. Exiled from peace of mind and their own hearts by a lust or curse that they cannot expiate, they break deep and ancient taboos. </p> <p>Few writers have felt this superstition more deeply, or handled it with a more self-conscious and driven intensity, than Herman Melville. Melville's extraordinary prose - with its restless struggle for a metaphysics of meaning lying deeper than words - makes every action of the human and natural world into a revelation of the battle between heaven and the demonic.</p> <p>His most famous stories are parables of the sea's power to realise a dammed-up, primitive evil which then spreads like a stain. In Billy Budd an angelic-seeming young sailor accidentally kills the ship's evil master-at-arms and is then executed by the queasy, temporising Captain Vere - who claims to believe in Budd's innocence, or beauty of soul, but also (as Melville unflinchingly recognises) wants to see him die. In Moby Dick the albino sperm whale on which the Nantucket whaling vessel Pequod 's Captain Ahab is seeking revenge for the loss of his leg becomes a living, breathing monster from the id, the embodiment of what Ahab, for all his profane fury, cannot resolve - his ruinous, corrupt, self-maiming ambition. </p> <p>Because literature thrives on metaphor, it is easy to forget that it begins elsewhere, in the real, tangible and self-evident. Nathaniel Philbrick's superbly readable new work of popular maritime history, In The Heart Of The Sea, gives us, in fascinating detail, the stark, bloodstained true story which Melville raided and then rebuilt to his own grandiose poetical specifications in Moby Dick, yet it never ignores the wider imaginative context - the ingrained, inexplicable superstitions of sea folklore that lend Melville's work its atmosphere of predestined moral tragedy. </p> <p>In November 1820 the whaling ship Essex, from the New England island of Nantucket, was shattered and sunk, far out in the Pacific, by an 85ft sperm whale. The bloodiness of the whaling expeditions was notorious, comparable to anything which befell the bison of the American plains. The kill - in which the whalers circled the doomed creature in rowing boats, striking at it with harpoons like Lilliputian matadors - was protracted and revoltingly inefficient.</p> <p>Worse still was the stench and gore which washed over the ship as the dead mammal was winched alongside, its blubber ripped from its carcass in a huge, dripping strip - Philbrick likens this process to the peeling of a gigantic orange - and approximately 500 gallons of valuable spermaceti oil, which would later be used to light the streetlamps of London, drained from the brain cavity of its decapitated head. </p> <p>It was filthy work, but full of atavistic excitement and the promise of high financial reward. It was also, under normal circumstances, free of any serious risk that the quarry would fight back. What astonished the crew of the Essex was their particular whale's mystifying belligerence. According to the ship's first mate, 23-year-old Owen Chase, it attacked at an angle ominously \"calculated to do us the most injury\" and, by repeatedly ramming the hull, left the vessel mortally damaged. </p> <p>The crew of the Essex were now in what Captain Scott might have described as a very tight place, dispersed in three small whaleboats in the middle of the Pacific with desperately limited supplies. Chase, normally a resourceful man, was temporarily broken by the experience. In the journal he wrote afterwards - and which is now republished by Pimlico - all the old sea superstitions come boiling to the surface. \"Unaccountable destiny\" is to blame, perhaps God Himself; \"anything but chance\".</p> <p>In the days that followed, Chase suffered joltingly vivid flashbacks as \"the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale wholly engrossed my reflections\". What Coleridge, coming at annihilating psychic trauma through the allegories of art, had described figuratively in The Ancient Mariner, Chase underwent literally, in an open boat 1,000 miles from land.

Of no natural phenomenon is this truer than of the sea, that eternal metaphor for psychological isolation and self-reliance. Seafaring is what happens to the human soul when it cuts itself free of the moorings of society and its stabilising codes of permitted behaviour. Out there, upon a wilderness of ocean, the human psyche makes a reckoning with its own essential loneliness. All the great sailors of literature - from Odysseus and the Anglo-Saxon Seafarer to Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, Melville's Ahab, Tennyson's Ulysses and Conrad's Lord Jim - are fleeing insanity, yet heading into it at the same time. The sea, eternally changing and eternally the same, reflects back at them some circularity in their own nature, a longing for fulfilment which recedes further the more they try to achieve it. Exiled from peace of mind and their own hearts by a lust or curse that they cannot expiate, they break deep and ancient taboos. Few writers have felt this superstition more deeply, or handled it with a more self-conscious and driven intensity, than Herman Melville. Melville's extraordinary prose - with its restless struggle for a metaphysics of meaning lying deeper than words - makes every action of the human and natural world into a revelation of the battle between heaven and the demonic. His most famous stories are parables of the sea's power to realise a dammed-up, primitive evil which then spreads like a stain. In Billy Budd an angelic-seeming young sailor accidentally kills the ship's evil master-at-arms and is then executed by the queasy, temporising Captain Vere - who claims to believe in Budd's innocence, or beauty of soul, but also (as Melville unflinchingly recognises) wants to see him die. In Moby Dick the albino sperm whale on which the Nantucket whaling vessel Pequod 's Captain Ahab is seeking revenge for the loss of his leg becomes a living, breathing monster from the id, the embodiment of what Ahab, for all his profane fury, cannot resolve - his ruinous, corrupt, self-maiming ambition. Because literature thrives on metaphor, it is easy to forget that it begins elsewhere, in the real, tangible and self-evident. Nathaniel Philbrick's superbly readable new work of popular maritime history, In The Heart Of The Sea, gives us, in fascinating detail, the stark, bloodstained true story which Melville raided and then rebuilt to his own grandiose poetical specifications in Moby Dick, yet it never ignores the wider imaginative context - the ingrained, inexplicable superstitions of sea folklore that lend Melville's work its atmosphere of predestined moral tragedy. In November 1820 the whaling ship Essex, from the New England island of Nantucket, was shattered and sunk, far out in the Pacific, by an 85ft sperm whale. The bloodiness of the whaling expeditions was notorious, comparable to anything which befell the bison of the American plains. The kill - in which the whalers circled the doomed creature in rowing boats, striking at it with harpoons like Lilliputian matadors - was protracted and revoltingly inefficient. Worse still was the stench and gore which washed over the ship as the dead mammal was winched alongside, its blubber ripped from its carcass in a huge, dripping strip - Philbrick likens this process to the peeling of a gigantic orange - and approximately 500 gallons of valuable spermaceti oil, which would later be used to light the streetlamps of London, drained from the brain cavity of its decapitated head. It was filthy work, but full of atavistic excitement and the promise of high financial reward. It was also, under normal circumstances, free of any serious risk that the quarry would fight back. What astonished the crew of the Essex was their particular whale's mystifying belligerence. According to the ship's first mate, 23-year-old Owen Chase, it attacked at an angle ominously \"calculated to do us the most injury\" and, by repeatedly ramming the hull, left the vessel mortally damaged. The crew of the Essex were now in what Captain Scott might have described as a very tight place, dispersed in three small whaleboats in the middle of the Pacific with desperately limited supplies. Chase, normally a resourceful man, was temporarily broken by the experience. In the journal he wrote afterwards - and which is now republished by Pimlico - all the old sea superstitions come boiling to the surface. \"Unaccountable destiny\" is to blame, perhaps God Himself; \"anything but chance\". In the days that followed, Chase suffered joltingly vivid flashbacks as \"the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale wholly engrossed my reflections\". What Coleridge, coming at annihilating psychic trauma through the allegories of art, had described figuratively in The Ancient Mariner, Chase underwent literally, in an open boat 1,000 miles from land. From these recurrent, plaguing memories Melville created not merely Ahab and the drama of the Pequod, but an idea of the sea as an ocean of the mind where our darkest impulses assume vengeful physical life. He knew that ultimately, human beings are wounded worst by their own imaginations. In the end, unable to find their way out of the arid wastes of the sea after months of scorching thirst and emaciating starvation, the survivors of the Essex resorted to cannibalism. In Chase's boat they fed only upon the flesh of those who had already died; but in another the Essex 's captain, George Pollard, permitted lots to be drawn and his own cousin to be shot in the head, dismembered and eaten. One of the strengths of Philbrick's book is that incidents like this - which are only glanced at in Chase's journal, partly because he did not personally witness them and partly because they offended his Quaker conscience - are reinvestigated and given proper context and weight. Pollard emerges as a well-meaning but weak man, too easily swayed by the headstrong opinions of others and morally unequal to the \"sinister violence of intention\", the unforgiving fickleness of fortune, which Joseph Conrad later thought was the supreme test of the sea against human nature. After the ordeal was over, he was given command of another whaling ship, which was promptly wrecked on a coral reef off the Hawaiian Islands. After this Pollard was never again trusted with a ship, and he ended his days on shore, low down the social scale, as Nantucket's night-watchman. \"I was lost on an infinite sea,\" sings the guilt-stricken captain Vere in Benjamin Britten's opera of Billy Budd. So too were Pollard, Chase and the men of the Essex. What's impressive about In the Heart of the Sea is its power to suggest that tragedy is what happens when men cannot rise above themselves. Neither the group of sailors Bligh had famously led across the Pacific without charts after being cast adrift from the Bounty, nor the crew Shackleton miraculously rescued from death in the Weddell Sea by crossing South Georgia on foot, finished up the way the survivors of the Essex did - in blood-blackened boats, gnawing human bones. Literature feeds on something uncontainable in such stories.

He felt so loved growing up in his tough little world that he told himself it was an aberration. </p> <p>Then, when he was 21 and working as a Federal Investigator in sexual diseases, he met a baby-rapist; when he found out there were more, his focus tightened on what he saw as a curable plague. With ferocious purpose, he directed himself to removing predatory paedophiles from society. He also became involved with the campaign to save children in Biafra and ran a prison for murderous juveniles. Finally, he settled as a lawyer, who would take only child cases, and as a writer. </p> <p>Vachss's crime novels are set in a New York recast as hell, a literal underworld of icy wasteground etched in red flame, where his hero, abuse victim Burke, lives an outcast existence with his chosen \"family\" - a mute giant, a dwarf genius, a transsexual - preying on predators, on the human capacity for cruel pleasure that Vachss calls \"the Beast\". Shella (1993), his only non-Burke novel, saw a sociopath search for his soul, finding it in love for a woman skeletal from Aids, caught by sucking the blood of murdered paedophiles. The prose was not so much lurid as desolate. </p> <p>Vachss has written comics and non-fiction, too. His appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show was instrumental in Bill Clinton signing the National Child Protection Act. But the Burke books, spare and angry, intended to document their hero's numb decline, remain his convictions' major outlet (in the new Safe House, stalkers and Nazis are fought). </p> <p>The greatest threat to his campaign loomed the day it began - when Vachss met that baby-rapist and nearly lost it. \"My first reaction was literally seeing myself snapping this person's neck like you'd kill a chicken,\" he remembers, \"I had never felt such rage. And I realised in the same moment that if I were not completely calm, I would lose every opportunity to ever do anything about this. That desperate calm, and the subsequent experiences with which I was bombarded, cauterised my nerve endings. So not much affects me. I don't get extremely happy or extremely sad. That was the price I paid.\" </p> <p>In Safe House, Burke reaches for \"the ice inside me\" - much as his creator does in his law work. \"If you think about what a child's been through, about how someone can torture something they gave birth to, you'll be lost,\" says Vacchs. \"Getting control of my temperament as a teenager was the key to everything I've been able to do. I was already engaged in a process of self-control. I'd seen too many people in my neighbourhood end badly. But my only purpose back then was to shoot pool, chase girls. After I met that baby-rapist, everything took the same path.\" </p> <p>Did he feel he had a choice ? \"No. The way religious people talk about getting a call - that's what it felt like to me. It was a message I couldn't ignore. I couldn't have lived with myself.\" Vachss's first response was to enter Biafra's tribal inferno. Stung by seeing \"waves of children starving on TV, at an age where the grandiose idea I could save them overwhelmed me,\" he took vast risks to set up supply lines.</p> <p>The chaos of the Nigerian civil war doomed his efforts, but as he struggled, defining images seared him: of a child asking why he was running during an air-raid, when the bombs couldn't see him, and he'd die anyway. And of a hungry, hunted woman snatching up an abandoned baby hours from inevitable, starved death, and holding it to her breast, so it would die loved. \"I've seen the best of people as well as the worst,\" Vachss says. </p> <p>The Burke books have been criticised for their zero-tolerance of sexual predators. But when Vachss talks of his own chance to administer rough justice, taking over a maximum-security prison for juveniles, his desire to save as many as possible, rather than simply punish them, is clear. The textbook he wrote on his methods is still used. The fiction followed, influenced by pulp writers like David Goodis and Paul Cain, as well as by Iceberg Slim and blues records. </p> <p>He has always seen his novels not so much as art as like \"Trojan horses\" - a way of smuggling his views into the popular consciousness. The brutal beauty of a book like Hard Candy (1989) is, he claims, \"fortuitous\". Writing causes him pain not pleasure, unearthing bad memories. His work as a whole has left him physically and emotionally injured, under permanent threat from the enemies he has made along the way. The way he tells it, it sounds a sacrificial life. </p> <p>\"It gives me too much credit to call it sacrifice,\" he says. \"I don't do what I do because I love children, I do it because I hate those who prey on them. So the sacrifice is to my hatred, not my love. It hasn't affected my life that much. I have good security on numerous levels.\" He also has what he calls his \"brothers and sisters - warriors who are my family of choice\". It makes him sound like Burke, living in his safe house. Does that mean that, at 57, he's subject to his character's exhaustion? </p> <p>No, he says. \"I don't ever feel exhausted by the struggle, because the victories have been higher than I fantasised. I've seen a kid who by every measure was fated to be a serial killer rescued, and become a loving parent. Public attitudes have changed. Any cost I've paid seems fair.

The book's arch opening chapter explains the nomenclature: the Soviet teenagers of the 1970s chose Pepsi as their preferred soft drink, signifying the taste of freedom. Faith in Communism had vanished, to be replaced by sugary brown water. </p> <p>Exemplary of this rootless generation is the novel's hero, Babylen Tatarsky. He grows up and dabbles in poetry, but eventually the collapse of Soviet power renders his verses impotent and pointless in the face of the new order's absurdity. He can't understand \"why it was worth exchanging an evil empire for an evil banana republic that imported its bananas from Finland\". </p> <p>This artistic dilemma is also by implication that of Pelevin himself: how to respond to a Russia, and a wider postmodern world, that is so barking as to be almost beyond satire. Pelevin has chosen the fantastic as a suitable analogue, and become a cult literary bad-boy in his homeland. Babylen Takarsky, on the other hand, is saved from life in a cigarette kiosk by a mysterious friend and sucked into the world of advertising. Same difference. </p> <p>The first few chapters of Babylon have a great deal of fun with Takarsky's work. All the television commercials he works on are for Western products, which need a specific cultural twist to play well in the Russian imagination. One of the hero's masterpieces runs thus: \"Russia was always notorious for the gap between culture and civilisation. Now there is no more culture. No more civilisation. The only thing that remains is the Gap. The way they see you.\" A terser effort is Tatarsky's speculative concept for Reebok, finessing the Nike slogan with \"Do it yourself, motherfucker\". </p> <p>One of the greatest pleasures of Pelevin's writing is the perfectly pitched irony of his narrative voice, which pokes fun at his characters but never abandons sympathy for them. When Tatarsky enjoys a mushroom-induced revelation, for example, we are told that \"he was filled with happiness at having managed to formulate the answer to a question that had tormented humanity for the last several thousand years in terms so simple anyone could understand them\". </p> <p>Soon enough, however, it becomes clear that ad-slapstick is not enough to power a whole novel, and Pelevin veers off into his trademark philosophical phantasmagoria. From the evidence of Babylon and his previous, brilliant The Clay Machine-Gun, the one thing that Pelevin takes seriously is Buddhism: this anchors his fiery imagination, giving it a species of moral authority. Drunk Russians in bars or on the battlefield hold sophisticated conversations about whether or not the world really exists, and what the meaning of death might be. </p> <p>In this novel the metaphysics is woven into a startlingly clever and only slightly tongue-in-cheek neo-Marxist theory of television, which is dictated to the hero through a ouija-board by the boisterous spirit of Che Guevara. To summarise the argument, which seems so central to Babylon as to make one suspect the novel was written around it, is to traduce its dazzling sophistry, but at base it turns out that all human life is determined by the simple transmission of three impulses through the media: the oral, anal and displacing wow-factors. The oral induces a powerful yearning for money to bring happiness; the anal induces the subject to excrete money to attain happiness; and the displacing wow-factor causes the subject to dismiss as irrelevant to the pursuit of happiness anything that does not concern money. </p> <p>Tatarsky receives this revelation dubiously. Meanwhile, events are getting curiouser and curiouser: an old samizdat text on the goddess Ishtar has been infecting the real world, and an ancient dragon appears during an acid trip. \"You're a copywriter, aren't you?\" it accuses Tatarsky. \"That means you are one of those who force people to gaze into the consuming fire.\" </p> <p>Pelevin likes to imitate the form of detective fiction, although the search is more important than the destination. In the last third of the novel Tatarsky is initiated into a huge politico-cultural conspiracy - but it is so delightfully realised that to reveal it would be an act of gibbering critical sabotage. And even if Babylon sputters out, finding its fuel tanks too rapidly emptied, and crashes off the road rather than executing a perfect stop, the ride has been so deliciously inventive that you don't mind at all.</p>",

Consequently, references to her litter the book, counterpointing Bronwen's saintliness.

Despite Stanford's best efforts to elevate her (\"Bronwen has made me think, stretched me.

This book is as close as the general reader will get to science writing the way scientists think it ought to be.</p> <p>You will, for instance, learn from it an immense amount about the extremely complicated processes involved in the fertilisation of an egg.

So much for the doctrine that life begins at conception!</p> <p>But this, perhaps the most memorable news in the whole book - for there can be no one who does not already know that Dolly was cloned by the authors - does not emerge until page 193, and though the authors notice in passing that it \"surely has significance for theologians and moral philosophers\", they at once plunge back into densely detailed jargon. \"Now we come to the part that really matters: how the cell cycle is controlled. There is mitosis. There is DNA replications (S phase). The DNA must replicate completely, once and only once. Mitosis must not begin before S is complete.\" </p> <p>But why, and from what perspective, must one suppose that these technical details are \"the part that really matters\"? This is wilfully unpopular science writing but, paradoxically perhaps, it has produced something unusually valuable. There are hundreds of popular-science books which can teach us a great deal about the world around us; but the gift of an unpopular science book is that it shows the real workings of a scientist's mind and its utter refusal to consider the wider perspective. It tells a story as a professional journal would, with only two aims: to enable other scientists to copy what the authors have done, and to establish that they did it first. But there is a value to the general reader as well in being reminded at such length of the fiendish complications of cells: a certain immunity against the disease of supposing that we understand genes very well. </p> <p>Different sorts of biologists mean rather different things by the word \"gene\". Perhaps it would be fairer to say that they are interested in different aspects of what genes do; and one of these aspects is much better understood than the other. What is understood, because it is mostly mathematics, is the way in which genes can spread and shrink through a population when they are considered as units of heredity: genes \"for\" something or other. But when you ask how all these various genes combine to build bodies, the answer is that almost nothing is known. We do not even know exactly how many genes a human body has. </p> <p>We will find out, but until then the soaring mathematical splendours of theoretical biology have almost no connection with the gooey detail through which a cloner must trudge. Life Without Genes exhibits opposite failings to The Second Creation by being almost entirely theoretical: it ends up every bit as tedious, but without actually conveying much knowledge about the real world. It may just be me, but when I read hundreds of pages of argument in such style as \"Let us now imagine a binding site shape space called Catalystic Shape Space. This is the theoretical Shape of all Possible Three-dimensional Molecular Shapes able to catalyse the chemical reactions that comprise the complete catalytic repertoire housed within the Space of all possible Metabolisms\", I enter the space of all possible migraines. </p> <p>From the point of view of popular-science writing, what is needed are authors who can understand both the theories of evolutionary biology and the ways in which these insights fit into the unscientific but no less valuable knowledge and beliefs that we have about ourselves. The most level-headed and successful shot at this I have read for years is Alison Jolly's Lucy's Legacy. This is a book which deals with \"genes\" in their third and most popular sense, which is not scientific at all, but is encouraged by almost all the pop science you can read about them: genes understood as the shadowy divinities that shape our ends. </p> <p>You can see how this understanding derives from Darwinian theory. We have no trouble imagining how it is good for an animal to have eyes, or a sense of touch; these are produced by evolution. But at the same time as evolution works on the outward organs with which we understand the world, it also works on the inward understanding, so that a fish will flee from any shadow passing above, which might be a predatory bird, and a baby will recognise a human face before any other object in the world.</p> <p>Such adaptations also apply to our social reflexes: a duckling will follow Konrad Lorenz around, a baby will smile at a crudely drawn face before it reacts noticeably to anything else - and a human being will fall in love, often as incongruously as any duckling. Selfish-gene theory shows how the most successful genes are sometimes those which promote unselfish behaviour and selfless feelings. </p> <p>It's easy to say that genes condition our nature rather than determining our fate, but it's not very satisfying. In this perspective, genes become the medium for all sorts of discussions about fate, predestination and freedom which are predominantly philosophical and not scientific at all; you end up a very long way from the S phase of DNA replication in an embryonic sheep. But these discussions are here to stay: genes are now part of our understanding of ourselves. They affect the most intimate areas of our self-understanding, such as gender, with which Lucy's Legacy is greatly concerned.</p> <p>One of the things that makes this book so satisfying is the way it clearly and cleverly gets around the whole nature/nurture question by looking at the complex interplay between a mother and baby, in which each is programmed to learn from the other. This is not what anyone would call headline science: it's just well-written, witty, thought-provoking and full of fascinating detail.

Abe Ravelstein, the brilliant, self-mocking, high-living, ever-opinionated hero of Saul Bellow's new work, has asked the narrator, Chick, a favour. \"I'd like you to write me up after I'm gone.\" As Bellow let it be known long before the book was published, Ravelstein memorialises his friend and mentor Allan Bloom, and the request was Bloom's.</p> <p>Bellow's novels have often been rooted in memoir - most strikingly, his sad comedy Humboldt's Gift (1974) was based on his recollections of doomed poet and alcoholic Delmore Schwartz. But this is something more. \"I'm laying this on you as an obligation,\" Ravelstein tells the hesitant narrator. Here is the obligation's fulfilment. </p> <p>Bloom, who died in 1992, was a Chicago professor who became famous, or notorious, with his surprise bestseller The Closing of the American Mind (1987). This elegant conservative polemic, with an introduction by Bellow, argued that Disney and Derrida had done for liberal culture in America.</p> <p>Higher education in the humanities taught the young to find reflected in books merely their own senses of grievance or self-worth, and put anything difficult off limits. \"The popular success of his book drove the academics mad,\" writes Chick. It also enabled his friend to fund his expansive enjoyment of life, caught in a series of vivid, half-ludicrous vignettes. Thanks to a book saying that students should learn Ancient Greek, he can now stay in a Paris hotel in the suite next to Michael Jackson's. </p> <p>The appeal to Bellow of Ravelstein's extravagance and excitement is characteristic: the \"big-souled\" intellectual meeting up with the material world is the situation of most Bellow comedy.

      "bodyText": "Ravelstein Saul Bellow Viking, \u00a316.99, 233pp Buy it at BOL Is this fiction, exactly? Abe Ravelstein, the brilliant, self-mocking, high-living, ever-opinionated hero of Saul Bellow's new work, has asked the narrator, Chick, a favour. \"I'd like you to write me up after I'm gone.\" As Bellow let it be known long before the book was published, Ravelstein memorialises his friend and mentor Allan Bloom, and the request was Bloom's. Bellow's novels have often been rooted in memoir - most strikingly, his sad comedy Humboldt's Gift (1974) was based on his recollections of doomed poet and alcoholic Delmore Schwartz. But this is something more. \"I'm laying this on you as an obligation,\" Ravelstein tells the hesitant narrator. Here is the obligation's fulfilment. Bloom, who died in 1992, was a Chicago professor who became famous, or notorious, with his surprise bestseller The Closing of the American Mind (1987). This elegant conservative polemic, with an introduction by Bellow, argued that Disney and Derrida had done for liberal culture in America. Higher education in the humanities taught the young to find reflected in books merely their own senses of grievance or self-worth, and put anything difficult off limits. \"The popular success of his book drove the academics mad,\" writes Chick. It also enabled his friend to fund his expansive enjoyment of life, caught in a series of vivid, half-ludicrous vignettes. Thanks to a book saying that students should learn Ancient Greek, he can now stay in a Paris hotel in the suite next to Michael Jackson's. The appeal to Bellow of Ravelstein's extravagance and excitement is characteristic: the \"big-souled\" intellectual meeting up with the material world is the situation of most Bellow comedy. Ravelstein, whose hands tremble over small tasks with \"a tremendous eager energy that shook him when it was discharged\", tips the strongest French coffee down the most expensive jacket in Paris. He wants to be stylish, but his enthusiasm trips him up. He sets himself to lecture, but keeps turning to gossip. His wisdom is taken for wisecracks.

      "body": "<p><strong>\u00a9 Malcolm Gladwell, 2000</strong></p> <p>For Hush Puppies, the Tipping Point - that one dramatic moment in an epidemic, when everything can change all at once - came somewhere between late 1994 and early 1995.</p> <p>The brand had been all but dead until that point. Sales of the classic American brushed-suede shoes with the lightweight cr*pe sole were down to 30,000 pairs a year, mostly to backwoods outlets and small-town family stores. Wolverine, the company that makes Hush Puppies, was thinking of phasing out the shoes that made them famous. But then something strange happened. At a fashion shoot, two Hush Puppies executives - Owen Baxter and Geoffrey Lewis - ran into a stylist from New York, who told them that the classic Hush Puppies had suddenly become hip in the clubs and bars of downtown Manhattan.</p> <p>\"We were being told,\" Baxter recalls, \"that there were re-sale shops in the Village, in Soho, where the shoes were being sold. People were going to the little stores that still carried them.\" Baxter and Lewis were baffled at first. It made no sense to them that shoes that were so obviously out of fashion could make a comeback.</p> <p>By the autumn of 1995, things began to happen in a rush. First, the designer John Bartlett called. He wanted to use Hush Puppies in his spring collection. Then another Manhattan designer, Anna Sui, called, wanting shoes for her show. In Los Angeles, the designer Joel Fitzgerald put a 25ft inflatable basset hound - the symbol of the Hush Puppies brand - on the roof of his Hollywood store and gutted an adjoining art gallery to turn it into a Hush Puppies boutique.</p> <p>In 1995, the company sold 430,000 pairs, and the next year it sold four times that, and the year after that still more, until Hush Puppies were once again a staple of the wardrobe of the young American male. In 1996, Hush Puppies won the prize for best accessory at the Council of Fashion Designers awards dinner, and the president of the firm stood up on the stage with Calvin Klein and Donna Karan and accepted an award for an achievement that - as he would be the first to admit - his company had almost nothing to do with.</p> <p>How did that happen? Those first few kids, whoever they were, weren't deliberately trying to promote Hush Puppies. They were wearing them precisely because no one else would wear them. Then the fad spread to two designers, who used the shoes to peddle something else - high fashion. The shoes were an incidental touch. No one was trying to make Hush Puppies a trend. Yet, somehow, that's exactly what happened. The shoes passed a certain point in popularity and they tipped. How does a $30 pair of shoes go from a handful of downtown Manhattan hipsters and designers to every mall in America in the space of two years?</p> <p>The best way to understand the Hush Puppy boom, or the transformation of unknown books into bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life, is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas, products, messages and behaviours spread just like viruses do. Their chief characteristics - one, contagiousness; two, the fact that little causes can have big effects; and three, that change happens not gradually but at one dramatic moment - are the same three principles that define how measles moves through a school or flu attacks every winter. </p> <p>A world that follows the rules of epidemics is a very different place from the world we think we live in now. We have a very specific, biological notion of what contagiousness means. But, if there can be epidemics of crime or epidemics of fashion, there must be all kinds of things just as contagious as viruses.</p> <p>Have you ever thought about yawning, for instance? Yawning is a surprisingly powerful act. Just because you read the word \"yawning\" in the previous two sentences - and the two additional \"yawns\" in this sentence - a good number of you will probably yawn within the next few minutes. Even as I'm writing this, I've yawned twice. If you're reading this in a public place, and you've just yawned, chances are that a good proportion of everyone who saw you yawn is now yawning, too.</p> <p>Yawning is incredibly contagious. If you play an audiotape of a yawn to blind people, they'll yawn, too. And finally, if you yawned as you read this, did the thought cross your mind - however unconsciously and fleetingly - that you might be tired? I suspect that for some of you it did, which means that yawns can also be emotionally contagious. Simply by writing the word, I can plant a feeling in your mind. </p> <p>The second of the principles of epidemics - that little changes can somehow have big effects - is also a fairly radical notion. We are heavily socialised to make a kind of rough approximation between cause and effect. We are trained to think that what goes into any transaction or relationship or system must be directly related, in intensity and dimension, to what comes out.</p> <p>Consider, for example, the following puzzle. I give you a large piece of paper, and I ask you to fold it over once, and then take that folded paper and fold it over again, and then again, and again, until you have re-folded the original paper 50 times. How tall do you think the final stack is going to be? In answer to that question, most people will fold the sheet in their mind's eye, and guess that the pile would be as thick as a phone book or, if they're really courageous, they'll say that it would be as tall as a refrigerator.</p> <p>But the real answer is that the height of the stack would approximate the distance to the sun. And if you folded it over one more time, the stack would be as high as the distance to the sun and back. This is an example of what in mathematics is called a geometric progression. </p> <p>Epidemics are another example of geometric progression: when a virus spreads through a population, it doubles and doubles again, until it has (figuratively) grown from a single sheet of paper all the way to the sun in 50 steps. To appreciate the power of epidemics, we have to abandon any expectation about proportionality. </p> <p>The possibility of sudden change is at the centre of the idea of the Tipping Point. It is the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point. I remember once as a child seeing our family's puppy encounter snow for the first time. He was shocked and delighted and overwhelmed, wagging his tail nervously, sniffing about in this strange, fluffy substance, whimpering with the mystery of it all.</p> <p>It wasn't much colder on the morning of his first snowfall than it had been the evening before. It might have been 1\u00baC the previous evening, and now it was minus 1\u00baC. Almost nothing had changed, in other words, yet everything had changed. Rain had become something entirely different. Snow! We are all, at heart, gradualists, our expectations set by the steady passage of time. But the world of the Tipping Point is a place where the unexpected becomes expected, where radical change is more than possibility: it is - contrary to all our expectations - a certainty. Why is it that some ideas or behaviours or products start epidemics and others don't?</p> <p>*****</p> <p>In the mid-90s, the city of Baltimore was attacked by an epidemic of syphilis. In the space of a year, from 1995 to 1996, the number of children born with the disease increased by 500%.</p> <p>What caused Baltimore's syphilis problem to tip? According to the Centres for Disease Control, the problem was crack cocaine. Crack is known to cause a dramatic increase in the kind of risky sexual behaviour that leads to the spread of things such as HIV and syphilis. It brings far more people into poor areas to buy drugs, which then increases the likelihood that they will take an infection home with them to their own neighbourhood. </p> <p>John Zenilman of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, an expert on sexually-transmitted diseases, has another explanation: the breakdown of medical services in the city's poorest neighbourhoods. \"In 1990-91, we had 36,000 patient visits at the city's sexually-transmitted disease clinics,\" Zenilman says. \"Then the city decided to gradually cut back staff because of budgetary problems. Patient visits dropped to 21,000.\" </p> <p>When there were 36,000 patient visits a year in the STD clinics of Baltimore's inner city, in other words, the disease was kept in equilibrium. At some point between 36,000 and 21,000 patient visits a year, according to Zenilman, the disease erupted. Suddenly, people who might have been infectious for a week before getting treated were now going around infecting others for two or three or four weeks before they got cured. </p> <p>There is a third theory, which belongs to John Potterat, one of the US's leading epidemiologists. His culprits are the physical changes in those years affecting East and West Baltimore, the heavily depressed neighbourhoods on either side of Baltimore's downtown, where the syphilis problem was centred.</p> <p>In the mid-1990s, he points out, Baltimore embarked on a highly-publicised policy of dynamiting the old 1960s-style public housing high-rises in East and West Baltimore. Two of the most publicised demolitions were huge projects, housing hundreds of families, that served as centres for crime and infectious disease. At the same time, people began to move out of the old terrace houses in East and West Baltimore, as those began to deteriorate as well.</p> <p>Potterat says, \"For years, syphilis had been confined to a specific region of Baltimore, within highly confined socio-sexual networks. The housing dislocation process served to move these people to other parts of Baltimore, and they took their syphilis and other behaviours with them.\"</p> <p>What is interesting about these three explanations is that none of them is at all dramatic. The CDC thought that crack was the problem. But it wasn't as if crack came to Baltimore for the first time in 1995; it had been there for years. Zenilman, likewise, wasn't saying that the STD clinics in Baltimore were shut down; they were simply scaled back. Nor was Potterat saying that all Baltimore was hollowed out. All it took, he said, was the demolition of a handful of housing projects and the abandonment of homes in key neighbourhoods to send syphilis over the top. It takes only the smallest of changes to shatter an epidemic's equilibrium.</p> <p>In other words, there is more than one way to tip an epidemic. Epidemics are a function of the people who transmit infectious agents, the infectious agent itself, and the environment in which the infectious agent is operating. And when an epidemic tips, it tips because something has happened, some change has occurred in one (or two or three) of those areas. These three agents of change I call the Law Of The Few, the Stickiness Factor, and the Power Of Context.</p> <p>When we say that a handful of East Village kids started the Hush Puppies epidemic, or that the scattering of the residents of a few housing projects was sufficient to start Baltimore's syphilis epidemic, what we are really saying is that, in a given process or system, some people matter more than others.</p> <p>This is not, on the face of it, a particularly radical notion. Economists often talk about the 80/20 Principle, which is the idea that, in any situation, roughly 80% of the \"work\" will be done by 20% of the participants. In most societies, 20% of criminals commit 80% of crimes. Twenty per cent of motorists cause 80% of all accidents. When it comes to epidemics, though, this disproportionality becomes even more extreme: a tiny percentage of people do the majority of the work.</p> <p>The second factor, the Stickiness Factor, ensures that a message doesn't go in one ear and out the other. Stickiness means that a message makes an impact. You can't get it out of your head. When Winston filter-tip cigarettes were introduced in the spring of 1954, for example, the company came up with the slogan \"Winston tastes good like a cigarette should\". Within months of its introduction, on the strength of that catchy phrase, Winston tipped, racing into second place in the US cigarette market. Within a few years, it was the bestselling brand in the country.</p> <p>The Power Of Context demonstrates how even the smallest and subtlest and most unexpected of factors can affect the way we act. One of the most infamous incidents in New York City history, for example, was the 1964 stabbing death of a young Queens woman by the name of Kitty Genovese. Genovese was chased by her assailant and attacked three times on the street, over the course of half-an-hour, as 38 of her neighbours watched from their windows. During that time, however, none of the 38 witnesses called the police.</p> <p>The case provoked rounds of self-recrimination. It became symbolic of the cold and dehumanising effects of urban life. Abe Rosenthal, who would later become editor of the New York Times, wrote in a book about the case: \"Nobody can say why the 38 did not lift the phone while Miss Genovese was being attacked, since they cannot say themselves. It can be assumed, however, that their apathy was indeed one of the big-city variety. Indifference to one's neighbour and his troubles is a conditioned reflex in life in New York as it is in other big cities.\"</p> <p>This is the kind of environmental explanation that makes intuitive sense to us. The truth about Genovese, however, turns out to be a little more complicated - and more interesting. Two New York City psychologists subsequently conducted a series of studies to try to understand what they dubbed the \"bystander problem\".</p> <p>They staged emergencies in different situations in order to see who would come and help. What they found was that the one factor, above all else, that predicted helping behaviour was how many witnesses there were to the event. In one experiment, for example, they had a student alone in a room stage an epileptic fit. When there was just one person next door, listening, that person rushed to the student's aid 85% of the time. But when subjects thought that there were four others also overhearing the seizure, they came to the student's aid only 31% of the time.</p> <p>In other words, when people are in a group, responsibility for acting is diffused. They assume that someone else will make the call, or they assume that because no one else is acting, the apparent problem isn't really a problem. In the case of Kitty Genovese, then, social psychologists argue, the lesson is not that no one called despite the fact that 38 people heard her scream; it's that no one called because 38 people heard her scream. Ironically, had she been attacked on a lonely street with just one witness, she might have lived.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>On the afternoon of April 18, 1775, a young boy who worked at a livery stable in Boston overheard one British army officer say to another something about \"hell to pay tomorrow\". The stable boy ran with the news to Boston's North End, to the home of a silversmith named Paul Revere.</p> <p>Revere listened gravely; this was not the first rumour to come his way that day. Earlier, he had been told of an unusual number of British officers gathered on Boston's Long Wharf, talking in low tones. As the afternoon wore on, Revere and his close friend, Joseph Warren, became more and more convinced that the British were about to make the major move that had long been rumoured - to march to the town of Lexington, northwest of Boston, to arrest the colonial leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams, and then on to the town of Concord to seize the stores of guns and ammunition that some of the local colonial militia had stored there.</p> <p>What happened next has become part of historical legend, a tale told to every American schoolchild. At 10 o'clock that night, Warren and Revere met. They decided they had to warn the communities surrounding Boston that the British were on their way, so that local militia could be roused to meet them.</p> <p>Revere was spirited across Boston Harbour to the ferry landing at Charlestown. He jumped on a horse and began his \"midnight ride\" to Lexington. In two hours, he covered 13 miles. In every town he passed through along the way - Charlestown, Medford, North Cambridge, Menotomy - he knocked on doors and spread the word, telling local colonial leaders of the oncoming British, and telling them to spread the word to others. Church bells started ringing. Drums started beating. The news spread like a virus as those informed by Paul Revere sent out riders of their own, until alarms were going off throughout the entire region.</p> <p>When the British finally began their march toward Lexington on the morning of the 19th, their foray into the countryside was met - to their utter astonishment - with organised and fierce resistance. In Concord that day, the British were confronted and soundly beaten by the colonial militia, and from that exchange came the war known as the American Revolution.</p> <p>Paul Revere's ride is perhaps the most famous historical example of a word-of-mouth epidemic. </p> <p>A piece of extraordinary news travelled a long distance in a very short time, mobilising an entire region to arms. Not all word-of-mouth epidemics are this sensational, of course. But it is safe to say that word of mouth is - even in this age of mass communications and multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns - still the most important form of human communication. But why does it not always work? Why is it that some ideas and trends and messages \"tip\" and others don't?</p> <p>In the case of Paul Revere's ride, the answer to this seems easy. Revere was carrying a sensational piece of news: the British were coming. But if you look closely at the events of that evening, that explanation doesn't solve the riddle either. At the same time that Revere began his ride, a fellow revolutionary - a tanner by the name of William Dawes - set out on the same urgent errand, working his way to Lexington via the towns west of Boston.</p> <p>He was carrying the identical message, through just as many towns over just as many miles as Paul Revere. But Dawes's ride didn't set the countryside afire. The local militia leaders weren't alerted. In fact, so few men from one of the main towns he rode through - Waltham - fought the following day that some subsequent historians concluded that it must have been a strongly pro-British community. It wasn't. The people of Waltham just didn't find out the British were coming until it was too late. If it were only the news itself that mattered in a word-of-mouth epidemic, Dawes would now be as famous as Paul Revere. He isn't. So why did Revere succeed where Dawes failed?</p> <p>The answer is that the success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts. Revere's news tipped and Dawes's didn't because of the differences between the two men. This is the Law Of The Few. Paul Revere was a Connector.</p> <p>He was, for example, intensely social. When he died, his funeral was attended, in the words of one contemporary newspaper account, by \"troops of people\". He was a fisherman and a hunter, a card player and a theatre-lover, a frequenter of pubs and a successful businessman. He was active in the local masonic lodge and was a member of several select social clubs. He was also a doer.</p> <p>It is not surprising, then, that when the British army began its secret campaign in 1774 to root out and destroy the stores of arms and ammunition held by the fledgling revolutionary movement, Revere became a kind of unofficial clearing house for the anti-British forces. He knew everybody. He was the logical one to go to if you were a stable boy and overheard two British officers talking. Nor is it surprising that when Revere set out for Lexington that night, he would have known just how to spread the news as far and wide as possible. When he came upon a town, he would have known exactly whose door to knock on, who the local militia leader was, who the key players in town were. But William Dawes? Clearly he had none of the social gifts of Revere, because there is almost no record of anyone who remembers him that night.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>In 1996, Rebecca Wells, a sometime actress and playwright, published a book entitled Divine Secrets Of The Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Its arrival in the book stores was not a major literary event. Wells had written one previous book - Little Altars Everywhere - which had been a minor cult hit in and around her hometown of Seattle. But she was not Danielle Steel. When Wells gave a reading in Greenwich, Connecticut, soon after her book was published, there were seven people in the audience. She had a smattering of reviews, mostly positive, and in the end her book sold a very respectable 15,000 copies in hardback.</p> <p>A year later, Ya-Ya Sisterhood came out in paperback. The first edition of 18,000 copies sold out in the first few months, exceeding expectations. By early summer, total paperback sales had reached 30,000, and both Wells and her editor began to get the sense that something strange and wonderful was about to happen.</p> <p>\"I'd be signing books and there would be groups of women who would come together - six or seven women - and they would have me sign anywhere between three and 10 books,\" Wells remembered later. The publishers bought one ad, opposite the contents page of the New Yorker magazine and, in the space of a month, sales doubled to 60,000. Going from one reading to the next, across the country, Wells began to see changes in the composition of her audience. \"I started noticing mothers and daughters coming. The daughters would be in their late 30s, early 40s. The mothers were of the generation who went to high school during world war two. Then I noticed that there started to be three generations coming, twentysomethings as well. And then, to my total delight - and this didn't happen until later - there would be teenagers and fifth-graders.\"</p> <p>Through the power of word of mouth, her book had tipped. \"The turning point for me was probably in northern California, the winter after the paperback came out,\" Wells said. \"I walked into a situation where there were 700 and 800 people at my readings.\"</p> <p>Why did Ya-Ya Sisterhood turn into an epidemic? In retrospect, the answer seems fairly straightforward. The book itself is heartwarming and beautifully written, a compelling story of friendship and mother-daughter relationships. It spoke to people. It's sticky. Then there's the fact that Wells herself is an actress. She didn't read from her novel as she travelled across the country so much as she acted it out, turning her readings into performances. Wells is a classic Salesman. But there is a third, less obvious, factor here, which has to do with the last of the principles of epidemics. The success of Ya-Ya is a tribute to the Power Of Context. More specifically, it is testimony to the power of one specific aspect of context, which is the critical role that groups play in social epidemics.</p> <p>In a way, this is an obvious observation. Anyone who has ever been to the movies knows that the size of the crowd in the theatre has a big effect on how good the movie seems: comedies are never funnier and thrillers never more thrilling than in a packed movie house. The first bestseller list on which Ya-Ya Sisterhood appeared was the Northern California Independent Bookseller's list. Northern California, as Wells said, was where 700 and 800 people first began showing up at her readings. It was where the Ya-Ya epidemic began. Why? Because the San Francisco area is home to one of the country's strongest book-group cultures, and from the beginning Ya-Ya was what publishers refer to as a \"book-group book\".</p> <p>It was the kind of emotionally sophisticated, character-driven, multi-layered novel that invites reflection and discussion. The groups of women who were coming to Wells's readings were members of reading groups, and they were buying extra copies not just for family and friends but for other members of their group. Women began forming Ya-Ya Sisterhood groups of their own, in imitation of the group described in the book, and bringing Wells pictures of their group for her to sign. </p> <p>The lesson of Ya-Ya is that small, close-knit groups have the power to magnify the epidemic potential of a message or idea. That conclusion, however, still leaves a number of critical questions unanswered. If we are interested in starting an epidemic - in reaching a Tipping Point - what are the most effective kinds of groups? Is there a simple rule of thumb that distinguishes a group with real social authority from a group with little power at all? As it turns out, there is. It's called the Rule of 150, and it is a fascinating example of the strange and unexpected ways in which context affects the course of social epidemics.</p> <p>The case for a social capacity has been made, most persuasively, by the British anthropologist Robin Dunbar. \"The figure of 150 seems to represent the maximum number of individuals with whom we can have a genuinely social relationship, the kind of relationship that goes with knowing who they are and how they relate to us. Putting it another way, it's the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar.\"</p> <p>Dunbar has combed through the anthropological literature and found that the number 150 pops up again and again. For example, he looks at 21 different hunter-gatherer societies for which we have solid historical evidence, from the Walbiri of Australia to the Tauade of New Guinea to the Ammassalik of Greenland to the Ona of Tierra del Fuego, and found that the average number of people in their villages was 148.4.</p> <p>The same pattern holds true for military organisation. It is still possible, of course, to run an army with larger groups. But at a bigger size you have to impose complicated hierarchies and rules and regulations to try to command loyalty and cohesion. So, if we want groups to serve as incubators for contagious messages, we have to keep groups below the 150 Tipping Point. Above that, there begin to be structural impediments to the ability of the group to agree and act with one voice. If we want to, say, develop schools in disadvantaged communities that can successfully counteract the problems of their surrounding neighbourhoods, this tells us that we're better off building lots of small schools rather than one or two big ones.</p> <p>That is the paradox of the epidemic: that in order to create one contagious movement, you often have to create many small movements first. To make sense of social epidemics, we must first understand that human communication has its own set of very unusual and counter-intuitive rules. What must underlie successful epidemics, in the end, is a bedrock belief that change is possible, that people can radically transform their behaviour or beliefs in the face of the right kind of impetus. We are actually powerfully influenced by our surroundings, our immediate context, and the personalities of those around us. </p> <p>If there is difficulty and volatility in the world of the Tipping Point, there is a large measure of hopefulness as well. Merely by manipulating the size of a group, we can dramatically improve its receptivity to new ideas. By tinkering with the presentation of information, we can significantly improve its stickiness. Simply by finding and reaching those few special people who hold so much social power, we can shape the course of social epidemics. In the end, Tipping Points are a reaffirmation of the potential for change and the power of intelligent action. Look at the world around you. It may seem like an immovable, implacable place. It is not. With the slightest push - in just the right place - it can be tipped</p> <p>This is an edited extract from The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make A Big Difference, by Malcolm Gladwell, published on May 11, 2000 by Little Brown, priced \u00a314.99.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u00a9 Malcolm Gladwell, 2000 For Hush Puppies, the Tipping Point - that one dramatic moment in an epidemic, when everything can change all at once - came somewhere between late 1994 and early 1995. The brand had been all but dead until that point. Sales of the classic American brushed-suede shoes with the lightweight cr*pe sole were down to 30,000 pairs a year, mostly to backwoods outlets and small-town family stores. Wolverine, the company that makes Hush Puppies, was thinking of phasing out the shoes that made them famous. But then something strange happened. At a fashion shoot, two Hush Puppies executives - Owen Baxter and Geoffrey Lewis - ran into a stylist from New York, who told them that the classic Hush Puppies had suddenly become hip in the clubs and bars of downtown Manhattan. \"We were being told,\" Baxter recalls, \"that there were re-sale shops in the Village, in Soho, where the shoes were being sold. People were going to the little stores that still carried them.\" Baxter and Lewis were baffled at first. It made no sense to them that shoes that were so obviously out of fashion could make a comeback. By the autumn of 1995, things began to happen in a rush. First, the designer John Bartlett called. He wanted to use Hush Puppies in his spring collection. Then another Manhattan designer, Anna Sui, called, wanting shoes for her show. In Los Angeles, the designer Joel Fitzgerald put a 25ft inflatable basset hound - the symbol of the Hush Puppies brand - on the roof of his Hollywood store and gutted an adjoining art gallery to turn it into a Hush Puppies boutique. In 1995, the company sold 430,000 pairs, and the next year it sold four times that, and the year after that still more, until Hush Puppies were once again a staple of the wardrobe of the young American male. In 1996, Hush Puppies won the prize for best accessory at the Council of Fashion Designers awards dinner, and the president of the firm stood up on the stage with Calvin Klein and Donna Karan and accepted an award for an achievement that - as he would be the first to admit - his company had almost nothing to do with. How did that happen? Those first few kids, whoever they were, weren't deliberately trying to promote Hush Puppies. They were wearing them precisely because no one else would wear them. Then the fad spread to two designers, who used the shoes to peddle something else - high fashion. The shoes were an incidental touch. No one was trying to make Hush Puppies a trend. Yet, somehow, that's exactly what happened. The shoes passed a certain point in popularity and they tipped. How does a $30 pair of shoes go from a handful of downtown Manhattan hipsters and designers to every mall in America in the space of two years? The best way to understand the Hush Puppy boom, or the transformation of unknown books into bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life, is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas, products, messages and behaviours spread just like viruses do. Their chief characteristics - one, contagiousness; two, the fact that little causes can have big effects; and three, that change happens not gradually but at one dramatic moment - are the same three principles that define how measles moves through a school or flu attacks every winter. A world that follows the rules of epidemics is a very different place from the world we think we live in now. We have a very specific, biological notion of what contagiousness means. But, if there can be epidemics of crime or epidemics of fashion, there must be all kinds of things just as contagious as viruses. Have you ever thought about yawning, for instance? Yawning is a surprisingly powerful act. Just because you read the word \"yawning\" in the previous two sentences - and the two additional \"yawns\" in this sentence - a good number of you will probably yawn within the next few minutes. Even as I'm writing this, I've yawned twice. If you're reading this in a public place, and you've just yawned, chances are that a good proportion of everyone who saw you yawn is now yawning, too. Yawning is incredibly contagious. If you play an audiotape of a yawn to blind people, they'll yawn, too. And finally, if you yawned as you read this, did the thought cross your mind - however unconsciously and fleetingly - that you might be tired? I suspect that for some of you it did, which means that yawns can also be emotionally contagious. Simply by writing the word, I can plant a feeling in your mind. The second of the principles of epidemics - that little changes can somehow have big effects - is also a fairly radical notion. We are heavily socialised to make a kind of rough approximation between cause and effect. We are trained to think that what goes into any transaction or relationship or system must be directly related, in intensity and dimension, to what comes out. Consider, for example, the following puzzle. I give you a large piece of paper, and I ask you to fold it over once, and then take that folded paper and fold it over again, and then again, and again, until you have re-folded the original paper 50 times. How tall do you think the final stack is going to be? In answer to that question, most people will fold the sheet in their mind's eye, and guess that the pile would be as thick as a phone book or, if they're really courageous, they'll say that it would be as tall as a refrigerator. But the real answer is that the height of the stack would approximate the distance to the sun. And if you folded it over one more time, the stack would be as high as the distance to the sun and back. This is an example of what in mathematics is called a geometric progression. Epidemics are another example of geometric progression: when a virus spreads through a population, it doubles and doubles again, until it has (figuratively) grown from a single sheet of paper all the way to the sun in 50 steps. To appreciate the power of epidemics, we have to abandon any expectation about proportionality. The possibility of sudden change is at the centre of the idea of the Tipping Point. It is the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point. I remember once as a child seeing our family's puppy encounter snow for the first time. He was shocked and delighted and overwhelmed, wagging his tail nervously, sniffing about in this strange, fluffy substance, whimpering with the mystery of it all. It wasn't much colder on the morning of his first snowfall than it had been the evening before. It might have been 1\u00baC the previous evening, and now it was minus 1\u00baC. Almost nothing had changed, in other words, yet everything had changed. Rain had become something entirely different. Snow! We are all, at heart, gradualists, our expectations set by the steady passage of time. But the world of the Tipping Point is a place where the unexpected becomes expected, where radical change is more than possibility: it is - contrary to all our expectations - a certainty. Why is it that some ideas or behaviours or products start epidemics and others don't? ***** In the mid-90s, the city of Baltimore was attacked by an epidemic of syphilis. In the space of a year, from 1995 to 1996, the number of children born with the disease increased by 500%. What caused Baltimore's syphilis problem to tip? According to the Centres for Disease Control, the problem was crack cocaine. Crack is known to cause a dramatic increase in the kind of risky sexual behaviour that leads to the spread of things such as HIV and syphilis. It brings far more people into poor areas to buy drugs, which then increases the likelihood that they will take an infection home with them to their own neighbourhood. John Zenilman of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, an expert on sexually-transmitted diseases, has another explanation: the breakdown of medical services in the city's poorest neighbourhoods. \"In 1990-91, we had 36,000 patient visits at the city's sexually-transmitted disease clinics,\" Zenilman says. \"Then the city decided to gradually cut back staff because of budgetary problems. Patient visits dropped to 21,000.\" When there were 36,000 patient visits a year in the STD clinics of Baltimore's inner city, in other words, the disease was kept in equilibrium. At some point between 36,000 and 21,000 patient visits a year, according to Zenilman, the disease erupted. Suddenly, people who might have been infectious for a week before getting treated were now going around infecting others for two or three or four weeks before they got cured. There is a third theory, which belongs to John Potterat, one of the US's leading epidemiologists. His culprits are the physical changes in those years affecting East and West Baltimore, the heavily depressed neighbourhoods on either side of Baltimore's downtown, where the syphilis problem was centred. In the mid-1990s, he points out, Baltimore embarked on a highly-publicised policy of dynamiting the old 1960s-style public housing high-rises in East and West Baltimore. Two of the most publicised demolitions were huge projects, housing hundreds of families, that served as centres for crime and infectious disease. At the same time, people began to move out of the old terrace houses in East and West Baltimore, as those began to deteriorate as well. Potterat says, \"For years, syphilis had been confined to a specific region of Baltimore, within highly confined socio-sexual networks. The housing dislocation process served to move these people to other parts of Baltimore, and they took their syphilis and other behaviours with them.\" What is interesting about these three explanations is that none of them is at all dramatic. The CDC thought that crack was the problem. But it wasn't as if crack came to Baltimore for the first time in 1995; it had been there for years. Zenilman, likewise, wasn't saying that the STD clinics in Baltimore were shut down; they were simply scaled back. Nor was Potterat saying that all Baltimore was hollowed out. All it took, he said, was the demolition of a handful of housing projects and the abandonment of homes in key neighbourhoods to send syphilis over the top. It takes only the smallest of changes to shatter an epidemic's equilibrium. In other words, there is more than one way to tip an epidemic. Epidemics are a function of the people who transmit infectious agents, the infectious agent itself, and the environment in which the infectious agent is operating. And when an epidemic tips, it tips because something has happened, some change has occurred in one (or two or three) of those areas. These three agents of change I call the Law Of The Few, the Stickiness Factor, and the Power Of Context. When we say that a handful of East Village kids started the Hush Puppies epidemic, or that the scattering of the residents of a few housing projects was sufficient to start Baltimore's syphilis epidemic, what we are really saying is that, in a given process or system, some people matter more than others. This is not, on the face of it, a particularly radical notion. Economists often talk about the 80/20 Principle, which is the idea that, in any situation, roughly 80% of the \"work\" will be done by 20% of the participants. In most societies, 20% of criminals commit 80% of crimes. Twenty per cent of motorists cause 80% of all accidents. When it comes to epidemics, though, this disproportionality becomes even more extreme: a tiny percentage of people do the majority of the work. The second factor, the Stickiness Factor, ensures that a message doesn't go in one ear and out the other. Stickiness means that a message makes an impact. You can't get it out of your head. When Winston filter-tip cigarettes were introduced in the spring of 1954, for example, the company came up with the slogan \"Winston tastes good like a cigarette should\". Within months of its introduction, on the strength of that catchy phrase, Winston tipped, racing into second place in the US cigarette market. Within a few years, it was the bestselling brand in the country. The Power Of Context demonstrates how even the smallest and subtlest and most unexpected of factors can affect the way we act. One of the most infamous incidents in New York City history, for example, was the 1964 stabbing death of a young Queens woman by the name of Kitty Genovese. Genovese was chased by her assailant and attacked three times on the street, over the course of half-an-hour, as 38 of her neighbours watched from their windows. During that time, however, none of the 38 witnesses called the police. The case provoked rounds of self-recrimination. It became symbolic of the cold and dehumanising effects of urban life. Abe Rosenthal, who would later become editor of the New York Times, wrote in a book about the case: \"Nobody can say why the 38 did not lift the phone while Miss Genovese was being attacked, since they cannot say themselves. It can be assumed, however, that their apathy was indeed one of the big-city variety. Indifference to one's neighbour and his troubles is a conditioned reflex in life in New York as it is in other big cities.\" This is the kind of environmental explanation that makes intuitive sense to us. The truth about Genovese, however, turns out to be a little more complicated - and more interesting. Two New York City psychologists subsequently conducted a series of studies to try to understand what they dubbed the \"bystander problem\". They staged emergencies in different situations in order to see who would come and help. What they found was that the one factor, above all else, that predicted helping behaviour was how many witnesses there were to the event. In one experiment, for example, they had a student alone in a room stage an epileptic fit. When there was just one person next door, listening, that person rushed to the student's aid 85% of the time. But when subjects thought that there were four others also overhearing the seizure, they came to the student's aid only 31% of the time. In other words, when people are in a group, responsibility for acting is diffused. They assume that someone else will make the call, or they assume that because no one else is acting, the apparent problem isn't really a problem. In the case of Kitty Genovese, then, social psychologists argue, the lesson is not that no one called despite the fact that 38 people heard her scream; it's that no one called because 38 people heard her scream. Ironically, had she been attacked on a lonely street with just one witness, she might have lived. ***** On the afternoon of April 18, 1775, a young boy who worked at a livery stable in Boston overheard one British army officer say to another something about \"hell to pay tomorrow\". The stable boy ran with the news to Boston's North End, to the home of a silversmith named Paul Revere. Revere listened gravely; this was not the first rumour to come his way that day. Earlier, he had been told of an unusual number of British officers gathered on Boston's Long Wharf, talking in low tones.

What happened next has become part of historical legend, a tale told to every American schoolchild. At 10 o'clock that night, Warren and Revere met. They decided they had to warn the communities surrounding Boston that the British were on their way, so that local militia could be roused to meet them. Revere was spirited across Boston Harbour to the ferry landing at Charlestown. He jumped on a horse and began his \"midnight ride\" to Lexington. In two hours, he covered 13 miles. In every town he passed through along the way - Charlestown, Medford, North Cambridge, Menotomy - he knocked on doors and spread the word, telling local colonial leaders of the oncoming British, and telling them to spread the word to others. Church bells started ringing. Drums started beating. The news spread like a virus as those informed by Paul Revere sent out riders of their own, until alarms were going off throughout the entire region. When the British finally began their march toward Lexington on the morning of the 19th, their foray into the countryside was met - to their utter astonishment - with organised and fierce resistance. In Concord that day, the British were confronted and soundly beaten by the colonial militia, and from that exchange came the war known as the American Revolution. Paul Revere's ride is perhaps the most famous historical example of a word-of-mouth epidemic. A piece of extraordinary news travelled a long distance in a very short time, mobilising an entire region to arms. Not all word-of-mouth epidemics are this sensational, of course. But it is safe to say that word of mouth is - even in this age of mass communications and multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns - still the most important form of human communication. But why does it not always work? Why is it that some ideas and trends and messages \"tip\" and others don't? In the case of Paul Revere's ride, the answer to this seems easy. Revere was carrying a sensational piece of news: the British were coming. But if you look closely at the events of that evening, that explanation doesn't solve the riddle either. At the same time that Revere began his ride, a fellow revolutionary - a tanner by the name of William Dawes - set out on the same urgent errand, working his way to Lexington via the towns west of Boston. He was carrying the identical message, through just as many towns over just as many miles as Paul Revere. But Dawes's ride didn't set the countryside afire. The local militia leaders weren't alerted. In fact, so few men from one of the main towns he rode through - Waltham - fought the following day that some subsequent historians concluded that it must have been a strongly pro-British community. It wasn't. The people of Waltham just didn't find out the British were coming until it was too late. If it were only the news itself that mattered in a word-of-mouth epidemic, Dawes would now be as famous as Paul Revere. He isn't. So why did Revere succeed where Dawes failed? The answer is that the success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts. Revere's news tipped and Dawes's didn't because of the differences between the two men. This is the Law Of The Few. Paul Revere was a Connector. He was, for example, intensely social. When he died, his funeral was attended, in the words of one contemporary newspaper account, by \"troops of people\". He was a fisherman and a hunter, a card player and a theatre-lover, a frequenter of pubs and a successful businessman. He was active in the local masonic lodge and was a member of several select social clubs. He was also a doer. It is not surprising, then, that when the British army began its secret campaign in 1774 to root out and destroy the stores of arms and ammunition held by the fledgling revolutionary movement, Revere became a kind of unofficial clearing house for the anti-British forces. He knew everybody. He was the logical one to go to if you were a stable boy and overheard two British officers talking. Nor is it surprising that when Revere set out for Lexington that night, he would have known just how to spread the news as far and wide as possible. When he came upon a town, he would have known exactly whose door to knock on, who the local militia leader was, who the key players in town were. But William Dawes? Clearly he had none of the social gifts of Revere, because there is almost no record of anyone who remembers him that night. ***** In 1996, Rebecca Wells, a sometime actress and playwright, published a book entitled Divine Secrets Of The Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Its arrival in the book stores was not a major literary event. Wells had written one previous book - Little Altars Everywhere - which had been a minor cult hit in and around her hometown of Seattle. But she was not Danielle Steel. When Wells gave a reading in Greenwich, Connecticut, soon after her book was published, there were seven people in the audience. She had a smattering of reviews, mostly positive, and in the end her book sold a very respectable 15,000 copies in hardback. A year later, Ya-Ya Sisterhood came out in paperback. The first edition of 18,000 copies sold out in the first few months, exceeding expectations. By early summer, total paperback sales had reached 30,000, and both Wells and her editor began to get the sense that something strange and wonderful was about to happen. \"I'd be signing books and there would be groups of women who would come together - six or seven women - and they would have me sign anywhere between three and 10 books,\" Wells remembered later. The publishers bought one ad, opposite the contents page of the New Yorker magazine and, in the space of a month, sales doubled to 60,000. Going from one reading to the next, across the country, Wells began to see changes in the composition of her audience. \"I started noticing mothers and daughters coming. The daughters would be in their late 30s, early 40s. The mothers were of the generation who went to high school during world war two. Then I noticed that there started to be three generations coming, twentysomethings as well. And then, to my total delight - and this didn't happen until later - there would be teenagers and fifth-graders.\" Through the power of word of mouth, her book had tipped. \"The turning point for me was probably in northern California, the winter after the paperback came out,\" Wells said. \"I walked into a situation where there were 700 and 800 people at my readings.\" Why did Ya-Ya Sisterhood turn into an epidemic? In retrospect, the answer seems fairly straightforward. The book itself is heartwarming and beautifully written, a compelling story of friendship and mother-daughter relationships. It spoke to people. It's sticky. Then there's the fact that Wells herself is an actress. She didn't read from her novel as she travelled across the country so much as she acted it out, turning her readings into performances. Wells is a classic Salesman. But there is a third, less obvious, factor here, which has to do with the last of the principles of epidemics. The success of Ya-Ya is a tribute to the Power Of Context. More specifically, it is testimony to the power of one specific aspect of context, which is the critical role that groups play in social epidemics. In a way, this is an obvious observation. Anyone who has ever been to the movies knows that the size of the crowd in the theatre has a big effect on how good the movie seems: comedies are never funnier and thrillers never more thrilling than in a packed movie house. The first bestseller list on which Ya-Ya Sisterhood appeared was the Northern California Independent Bookseller's list. Northern California, as Wells said, was where 700 and 800 people first began showing up at her readings. It was where the Ya-Ya epidemic began. Why? Because the San Francisco area is home to one of the country's strongest book-group cultures, and from the beginning Ya-Ya was what publishers refer to as a \"book-group book\". It was the kind of emotionally sophisticated, character-driven, multi-layered novel that invites reflection and discussion. The groups of women who were coming to Wells's readings were members of reading groups, and they were buying extra copies not just for family and friends but for other members of their group. Women began forming Ya-Ya Sisterhood groups of their own, in imitation of the group described in the book, and bringing Wells pictures of their group for her to sign. The lesson of Ya-Ya is that small, close-knit groups have the power to magnify the epidemic potential of a message or idea. That conclusion, however, still leaves a number of critical questions unanswered. If we are interested in starting an epidemic - in reaching a Tipping Point - what are the most effective kinds of groups? Is there a simple rule of thumb that distinguishes a group with real social authority from a group with little power at all? As it turns out, there is. It's called the Rule of 150, and it is a fascinating example of the strange and unexpected ways in which context affects the course of social epidemics. The case for a social capacity has been made, most persuasively, by the British anthropologist Robin Dunbar. \"The figure of 150 seems to represent the maximum number of individuals with whom we can have a genuinely social relationship, the kind of relationship that goes with knowing who they are and how they relate to us. Putting it another way, it's the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar.\" Dunbar has combed through the anthropological literature and found that the number 150 pops up again and again. For example, he looks at 21 different hunter-gatherer societies for which we have solid historical evidence, from the Walbiri of Australia to the Tauade of New Guinea to the Ammassalik of Greenland to the Ona of Tierra del Fuego, and found that the average number of people in their villages was 148.4. The same pattern holds true for military organisation. It is still possible, of course, to run an army with larger groups. But at a bigger size you have to impose complicated hierarchies and rules and regulations to try to command loyalty and cohesion. So, if we want groups to serve as incubators for contagious messages, we have to keep groups below the 150 Tipping Point. Above that, there begin to be structural impediments to the ability of the group to agree and act with one voice. If we want to, say, develop schools in disadvantaged communities that can successfully counteract the problems of their surrounding neighbourhoods, this tells us that we're better off building lots of small schools rather than one or two big ones. That is the paradox of the epidemic: that in order to create one contagious movement, you often have to create many small movements first. To make sense of social epidemics, we must first understand that human communication has its own set of very unusual and counter-intuitive rules. What must underlie successful epidemics, in the end, is a bedrock belief that change is possible, that people can radically transform their behaviour or beliefs in the face of the right kind of impetus. We are actually powerfully influenced by our surroundings, our immediate context, and the personalities of those around us. If there is difficulty and volatility in the world of the Tipping Point, there is a large measure of hopefulness as well. Merely by manipulating the size of a group, we can dramatically improve its receptivity to new ideas. By tinkering with the presentation of information, we can significantly improve its stickiness. Simply by finding and reaching those few special people who hold so much social power, we can shape the course of social epidemics. In the end, Tipping Points are a reaffirmation of the potential for change and the power of intelligent action. Look at the world around you. It may seem like an immovable, implacable place. It is not. With the slightest push - in just the right place - it can be tipped This is an edited extract from The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make A Big Difference, by Malcolm Gladwell, published on May 11, 2000 by Little Brown, priced \u00a314.99.",

This did not conflict with the union's opposition to the principle of the scheme, he argued.</p> <p>Under the present pay rules classroom teachers with at least seven years' experience are paid a maximum of about \u00a324,000 unless they take on additional management responsibilities.</p> <p>The education minister, Estelle Morris, said industrial action would not be in the interests of pupils in schools or the union's members. \"However, I am pleased that the NUT is recommending its members to apply for the performance-related threshold of \u00a32,000.\"</p>",

But this time, amid widespread contempt within the NUT for performance pay linked to pupils' results, the move backfired. The leftwingers can now claim majority support for a strike. The survey showed 98% of members rejected the govern ment's attempt to link performance pay with pupils' results, 96% thought it would not motivate teachers, and 95% said it would not support effective teaching. There were big majorities for action, including 76% wanting a national demonstration, 89% backing a boycott on any additional workload caused by the scheme, and 86% calling for a ballot on industrial action to boycott non-contractual duties. Mr McAvoy refused to specify what these duties might be, but they were understood to cover all work beyond the basic commitment to teach children, prepare lessons and run school administration. This was \"a fairly significant a la carte menu\", he said. The conference is expected to pass a priority motion supporting these forms of limited industrial action, but the left is likely to push hard for a national one-day strike. Mr McAvoy said most of the survey results reflected the views of the whole union membership and the 28% response rate was good. But he questioned the validity of the 60% vote in favour of a national stoppage that could disrupt children's education and antagonise parents. He said pro-strike campaigners were more likely to have voted in the survey. Non-voters were less likely to want disruptive action. It would be \"daft\" to go ahead with a stoppage with such slender backing. \"If you don't get overwhelming support, the government would say the action was driven by lunatics - the SWP and Socialist Teachers. I don't want to be leading that campaign,\" he said. But motions to be debated include a call for \"a programme of escalating action, up to and including strike action\", to be triggered if the union does not achieve its pay demands next year, \"or earlier if the government introduces any pay structure which is outside our aims\". In spite of opposition to the principle of performance pay, Mr McAvoy said the union was advising any member who may be eligible for it to apply unless there were personal reasons for not doing so. \"Don't listen to people telling you not to apply. Make your own decision,\" he said. The union was offering guidance to teachers on how to apply to pass the \"threshold assessment\" to qualify for an immediate salary increase of \u00a32,000 from September and promotion to a higher salary scale of up to \u00a330,000 a year. This did not conflict with the union's opposition to the principle of the scheme, he argued. Under the present pay rules classroom teachers with at least seven years' experience are paid a maximum of about \u00a324,000 unless they take on additional management responsibilities. The education minister, Estelle Morris, said industrial action would not be in the interests of pupils in schools or the union's members. \"However, I am pleased that the NUT is recommending its members to apply for the performance-related threshold of \u00a32,000.\"",

Whether or not United win the Premiership over Easter, the moment will hardly hold the nation in thrall because all reasonable doubts about their retaining the title had disappeared by the end of January. Though the failure of United and Chelsea to progress beyond the quarter-finals in the Champions League this time has been disappointing, the manner of their departures was memorable because of the way their conquerors, Raul and McManaman for Real Madrid, Luis Figo and Rivaldo for Barcelona, raised their performances for the occasion. And was not United's quirky progress to last season's triumph far preferable to winning the thing on points? T he danger is that Uefa has already gone as far as it can in acceding to club pressure for regular appearances in its tournaments without actually setting up a European League pure and simple. The idea of a European pay-TV soccer soap which would upstage the national leagues even more than the Champions League does now is appalling, but so long as the leading clubs are intent on paying players ever-increasing sums in order to appear in a competition which will enable the best talents to demand even higher salaries it will not go away. This week a survey in the Independent revealed that even the Premiership's spear- carriers are on an average of \u00a3400,000 a year. True, an NBA player, asked to appear for such a sum, would regard his prospective employers as basket cases but this is not America and if the next television windfall is simply going to produce more wage inflation then clubs whose turnovers are already struggling to keep pace will be no better off. And those in the Nationwide will need even bigger telescopes to measure the void between themselves and the nearest star.",

      "body": "<p>Fourteen years ago, Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short appeared in a clever, funny, heavily promoted film that performed dismally at the box-office. The Three Amigos was the tale of three unemployed silent film stars who had long specialised in playing virtuous Mexican cowboys sporting garish costumes and big hats. But their time had come and gone, and now they were looking for work. Any kind of work. One day, the amigos receive a tersely worded telegram from a tiny Mexican village requesting that they trundle down and help rid the peasants of their oppressor, the dreaded bandito \"El Guapo\". The compadres naturally assume that they have been invited south of the border to put on a show and regale the entertainment-starved paeons with their winning antics. So off they go. Alas, they soon discover that El Guapo is a genuine murderer, that the peasants are truly expecting salvation, and that the imbroglio they have entered involves real guns and real bullets. So they decide to run away.</p> <p>But then, much like the gunslingers with hearts of gold in The Magnificent Seven, the film that The Three Amigos ingeniously parodies, Martin, Chase and Short rise to the occasion and defeat El Guapo, thereby attaining a heroic stature they have heretofore only simulated. Yet despite this original plot, hilarious musical production numbers, crackling dialogue, wonderful work by Martin and Short, and a surprisingly animated performance from the usually AWOL Chase, The Three Amigos was a bomb. Were those of us who adored this cheerfully inane film completely out of our minds? Or was The Three Amigos a film that was ahead of its time?</p> <p>To make a long story short, The Three Amigos was simply a film that was ahead of its time. But now that it has been re-released as Galaxy Quest, those who missed it the first time around can atone for this oversight. In Galaxy Quest, Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman play pathetic, ageing veterans of a TV show not unlike Star Trek that was cancelled a generation ago, not unlike Star Trek, but has since spawned a huge cult following, not unlike Star Trek. To keep their creditors at bay, the trio of hams, accompanied by several even less glamorous chums, must make an endless series of personal appearances at conventions, department store-openings, etc. They are tragic little has-beens, and they despise one another. Whether this accurately describes the relationship between the survivors of Star Trek, I have no way of knowing. But I would certainly hope so. </p> <p>One day, Allen hooks up with a quartet of star-struck space bozos who escort him to what he believes is yet another promotional appearance. In fact, the four visitors are genuine extraterrestrials who have seen Allen's antics on TV but who have no way of knowing that his mighty deeds are fake. The space dorks, who bear a definite facial resemblance to the Teletubbies, want Allen and his crew to venture deep into space and rescue them from a cruel, voluble reptile who seems determined to reduce their civilisation to rubble.<br>It takes Allen quite a long time to realise what is happening here, and his crew members are not much faster on the uptake. But eventually, having taken a genuine liking to their hosts, they realise what is expected of them and rise to the occasion. They rise to the occasion the way Toshiro Mifune did in the Seven Samurai, and the way Yul Bryner did in The Magnificent Seven, and the way Steve Martin and Martin Short and Chevy Chase did in The Three Amigos, because these are all the same movie.</p> <p>People who dislike the tomfoolery Star Trek has unleashed on society should not be put off by the forgoing paragraphs. When I first asked my 13-year-old son if he would like to see Galaxy Quest, he asked me what kind of a jerk I thought he was, since wholesome teenage boys loathe Star Trek, and have occasionally been known to put overbearing Trekkies to the sword. But when I assured my son that Galaxy Quest would be a merciless attack on the Star Trek cult - and here I was only guessing - he finally agreed to attend. To our relief, we found that most of the people in the audience would never be mistaken for Star Trek aficionados, because they were normal, good-looking, suitably attired, and in some cases, female - a gender never seen at any Star Trek convention I know of. And, yes, a good time was had by all, since what is bad for Trekkies - movies like Galaxy Quest - is good for humans. </p> <p>A few caveats. Until I saw Galaxy Quest, I had not been a big fan of Tim Allen as a movie star. Reliably amusing as the tool guy on TV's Home Improvement, Allen seemed to phone in his performances in films such as The Santa Clause. But perhaps because Galaxy Quest is about an ageing star of the tiny screen who is suddenly asked to perform truly heroic feats, Allen seemed perfect for the role of William Shatner/Captain Kirk, pompous ass. Meanwhile, Alan Rickman, who seems like a strange chap anyway, was impeccably cast in the role of the drab, emotionless Doctor Spock.</p> <p>But the biggest surprise of all was Sigourney Weaver, in an uncharacteristically voluptuous performance as Allen's gorgeous, pointless Space Sidekick. It's been years since Weaver appeared in anything that was even vaguely funny, and Galaxy Quest affords her a brief respite from her official role as the Baby Boomer Joan Crawford. It cannot be an accident that Weaver, obstreperously bald in Alien III, herein sports the most bellicose wig since Mary-Elizabeth Mastrantonio donned that Pam Grier Afro in Scarface. No, it is not an accident; it is, in fact, one of the best jokes in a very funny film. Not as funny as The Three Amigos, of course.

We set off with two goals in seven minutes to defend like we defended in the first half was crap really. But I think all we need is one more win and we will be safe.\" </p> <p>That could come at Pride Park on Monday where they play a Southampton side free of their normal relegation worries. </p> <p>Meanwhile Jewell must now rally his exhausted troops for the difficult trip to the Stadium of Light. </p> <p>\u0095 Derby fans who had paid to watch the game on a giant television at Pride Pride invaded the pitch after a technical left them looking at a blank screen.

In a last desperate gamble to gain maximum points Jewell sent on Isiah Rankin and Dean Saunders, and it fell to the former Derby striker to miss their best chance. When he took the field the visiting fans had chanted his name and in the last seconds of stoppage time he was once again their hero as he wasted a glorious chance to win the match as he shot straight at Mart Poom. The whistle went, the home players sunk to their knees and hopes of survival became ever more distant. Both managers appeared exhausted and Smith said: \"That was the good, the bad and the ugly. But there was too much ugly for me,\" he said. \"At the end of the day I'm disappointed that we only drew. We set off with two goals in seven minutes to defend like we defended in the first half was crap really. But I think all we need is one more win and we will be safe.\" That could come at Pride Park on Monday where they play a Southampton side free of their normal relegation worries. Meanwhile Jewell must now rally his exhausted troops for the difficult trip to the Stadium of Light. \u0095 Derby fans who had paid to watch the game on a giant television at Pride Pride invaded the pitch after a technical left them looking at a blank screen. Around 200 of the 1000 fans staged the protest befiore being cleared by stewards. The club has promised to issue a full refund to the fans, who eventually had to settle for commentary from BBC Radio Derby.",

It may lead to disciplinary action by Uefa. </p> <p>Celebrations of Galatasaray's success in Turkay were marred when stray bullets, fired into the air by revellers, wounded five people across the country. A man was seriously injured in the head by a ricocheting bullet in the south-east city of Mus. </p> <p>Leicester's midfielder Muzzy Izzet has been named in a Turkish squad for Euro 2000 preparations.

      "bodyText": "Arsenal are seeking a Uefa inquiry into the French authorities' organisation of Thursday's semi-final return at Lens when nine of the north London club's fans were arrested after clashes with police as they attempted to enter the ground amid claims that Lens had resold blocks of tickets allocated to the visitors. A 2-1 victory assured a place in next month's Uefa Cup final in Copenhagen for Arsenal, who said that nine of their supporters also suffered minor injuries in the clashes. Arsenal, who sold out their 2,500 allocation, will want to establish how many of the fans involved in the trouble actually possessed tickets and listen to the grievances of supporters who have complained they were handcuffed and beaten by police. The club's managing director Ken Friar said Arsenal wanted to avoid a repeat of the problem at the final on May 17, a game of the highest profile because it again pits English opposition against Galatasaray of Turkey. So far Arsenal and the Istanbul club have each been allocated 12,000 tickets for the 42,000-capacity Parken Stadium, although this is expected to increase to around 16,000 apiece. One of the principal worries is that troublemakers will go to Copenhagen masquerading as Gunners fans to seek a confrontation with Galatasaray followers in retaliation for the fatal stabbing of two Leeds fans in Istanbul two weeks ago. The Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale has promised to ban for life the fan responsible for hitting Galatasaray's striker Hakan Sukur with a missile at Elland Road. Sukur was struck on the back of the head, believed to be by a coin, late in the second half on Thursday. It may lead to disciplinary action by Uefa. Celebrations of Galatasaray's success in Turkay were marred when stray bullets, fired into the air by revellers, wounded five people across the country. A man was seriously injured in the head by a ricocheting bullet in the south-east city of Mus. Leicester's midfielder Muzzy Izzet has been named in a Turkish squad for Euro 2000 preparations. The players will have a two-day training session in Istanbul.",

When they stormed Motya, a tiny Phoenician outpost off the coast of Sicily, they burned and raped like the barbarians they despised. So sudden was the massacre that the inhabitants barely had time to bury their valuables. </p> <p>Calamity, of course, is the mother of romance. Imagine. An island in the Med, veined with buried walls, stuffed with hidden riches. A beach where every boulder is a stone sarcophagus. A paradise of figs and grilled fish where the sun sets behind ruined watchtowers, 2,500 years old.

Don't bother your head about them.\" </p> <p>But Orizio did bother. In fact he became quite fascinated with these \"lost white tribes\" - Germans, French, Dutch, Poles - poor descendants of the rich white colonists who couldn't afford to take a steamer home when the colonial dream ended. Too white for some, too native for others, their society, says Orizio, is often \"a closed, incestuous microcosm\".

Sattin's curiosity was awakened when he witnessed a woman in a remote temple calling on one of the old gods to bless her with a child. Sure enough, when he began looking - whether in the streets of Cairo or the cemeteries of Alexandria - he found evidence that paganism is alive and well.

When they stormed Motya, a tiny Phoenician outpost off the coast of Sicily, they burned and raped like the barbarians they despised. So sudden was the massacre that the inhabitants barely had time to bury their valuables. Calamity, of course, is the mother of romance. Imagine.

      "body": "<p>Fish. There's no getting away from the word, the smell or the slippery things themselves. Fish, fish and fish again. That's Bergen for you on a plate. It also happens to be one of the several European cities of culture this year and, as its tourist season is just beginning (too cold for most non-Vikings before Easter), it was a must on my itinerary of world cities yet to be visited. </p> <p>If there was an I-Spy Book of Bergen, fish would feature largely but score few points because our scaly friends inform the Norwegian city as surely as lace does Bruges, the baroque does Salzburg and pork pies Melton Mowbray. As for culture, it's not as thin on the ground as I thought it would be. This isn't meant to be patronising. It's just that Bergenis not the first city to swim into the mind when the word culture, with its art-world ramifications, surfaces. </p> <p>Fish, I thought, my gills gaping. It can't be that bad. It was and it wasn't. I arrived on a cheap flight from Stansted. It was raining cats and dogfish. Bergen is famous for its rain. Still, the Grand Hotel Terminus by the imposing railway station was impressively old fashioned. With its stained glass, chandeliers and pre-war atmosphere, I felt abashed not arriving in tweeds, titfer, plus-fours and fishing tackle ready in search of a hearty breakfast (poached cod perhaps) before a trip along the fjords in search of Nordic beauty, the northern lights and some sport with the local fish. </p> <p>As it was, I went to a friend's all-night party. I can't bear to tell you what we ate because you know already. We drank lager and aquavit (potato whisky) because that's all anyone could afford. The price of drink is as high in Bergen as the smell of the you know what. </p> <p>The morning came, and I set off in search of culture. Mist hung low over a city that sprawls in long fingers away from the natural tidal inlets. The scale of Norway's second city - which I discovered largely by efficient local buses with a flat fare of about \u00a31 - is on the large side, not because of a big population (Norway's whole population could fit into half of London; Bergen's is about 250,000), but because Norwegians tend to live in suburban-style homes. </p> <p>Such low-density living does little for city life, which is why Bergen can feel a bit like a Baltic sea port of the Communist era. Museums and shops close early. A Sunday morning walk can seem dauntingly lonely. Small wonder Edvard Munch is, by general agreement, thought to be Norway's finest and most revealing painter. You can see some of the tortured master's work in the Bergen Art Museum housed in two buildings beside a lake on Rasmus Meyers Alle. </p> <p>Still, Sunday is as a good a day for museum browsing as it is anywhere in Europe. And, as befits a City of Culture, there are plenty of them. The Hanseatic Museum is housed in one of the city's distinctive 16th- and 17th-century clapboard harbourfront houses. Many of these have burned down over the centuries; fires were once banned even in the depths of freezing winter. </p> <p>I enjoyed the sight of the museum's impressive fish press. I learned that the historic fish storage room once processed a million pounds of fish a month and tried, without success, to imagine what those million pounds of salmon, trout, cod and herring looked like. An installation by a piscine artist high on aquavit perhaps. </p> <p>In 1890, the traveller Lilian Leland wrote of Bergen, \"Everything is fishy. You eat and drink fish and smell fish and breathe fish.\" I breathed a sigh of relief that I had missed the Monday-to-Saturday fish market at Torget. But there is no wriggling off the hook so easily. My Sunday stroll took me, in search of Bergen culture, to the Norges Fiskerimuseum where you can discover more than you will ever need to know about a certain Norwegian industry. </p> <p>Ole Bulls, however, is a meaty sounding name. Or so I thought when I first saw it on written on a sign. \"Hello to the mighty matador\" perhaps. Or just \"hello male cattle\". No, it turned out to be the decidedly unhispanic name (even though Norwegian Vikings once raided Seville in their rape'n'pillage heyday) of a 19th-century virtuoso whose wonderfully camp island villa nearby is a popular Sunday afternoon excursion for local families. </p> <p>Local women swooned apparently as Ole struck up on his fiddle. A mainstay of local culture, he looks harmless enough in the guise of a rather daft statue erected to his memory on my walk from the old town to the Kulturhuset USF (surely the heart, I thought, of Bergen, City of Culture 2000) via the Akvariet, the impressive city aquarium devoted to the culture of our finny friends. It is an educational place and perhaps the plaice are educated too: one of the most popular features of the aquarium is a school of herrings. </p> <p>Guess what the USF in Kulturhuset USF means? Oh go on. Please. Yes, the United Sardines Factory. This has now been converted into a fjordside contemporary arts complex. It's pretty good and one of the groovy places to hang out in Bergen (of which there are few). The caf\u00e9, bustling with young Vikings, is, I am pleased to say, called Kafe Kippers and there's a jazz festival here next month. </p> <p>The Kafe Permanenten in the basement of the downtown West Norway Applied Arts Museum is an open-sandwich kind of place during the day, but a fun dance club by night with all the usual thumpa-whumpa-whoompa sounds, dress and attitudes. </p> <p>For lunch, however, my party-going gang of Celts and Vikings repaired to the Enhjorniengen restaurant, back in Bryggen, the old Hanseatic merchant town which, although the heart of tourist town and with more than enough souvenir stalls selling trolls (for Thor's sake), is ruggedly pretty. The restaurant, set in an upper floor of an 18th- century's merchant house, was very good at about \u00a330 a head. I can hardly bare to tell you what sort of food it specialises in, but let me put it this way; if you don't like fish, try elsewhere. </p> <p>The heart of Bergen's culture quarter comprises the two city art museums with plenty of Munch, and a small shoal of Toulouse- Lautrec, Picasso, Mir\u00f3 and Klee, but little in the way of fish. The nearby Vestlande Kunstindustrie Museum, housed in a Gothic pile (designed by a madman by the look of it), has a changing programme of contemporary design and craft exhibitions. Oh, and one of Ole Bulls' violins for the ladies in your party to swoon over. Or not. </p> <p>There was just time to drop in at the intriguing Lepramuseet, housed near the cathedral in the 18th-century buildings of St Jorgens Hospital. I do not know how many leprosy museums there are in the world, but this one is a gem, pretty much untouched since it was abandoned in 1946. </p> <p>Oh, and for fans of the baroque, do not miss the glorious pulpit in the Mariakirche in the centre of town. This was the church of the Hanseatic League merchants and it's easy to see them cloaked in fur praying for a fine harvest. One of their major exports to other Hanseatic cities was dried cod, a nourishing meal in wintertime. </p> <p>I wanted to see Gamle Bergen (Old Bergen), a kind of troll town or open-air village displaying local architecture in the city's northern suburbs, but this was closed (until May). I went instead to see the stave church at Fantoft, three miles south of the city centre. This wonderfully spiky and animalistic Viking church dates from 1992. The identical original church, which burnt down, had been moved here from Sognefjord, elsewhere in Norway in the 1880s. This was during the heyday of the National Romantic movements that swept through Scandinavia as these countries, usually under the yoke of another, struggled through culture to find themselves. To look to their roots. </p> <p>Nearby the church is Troldhaugen (\"Hill of the Trolls\" would you believe), the home of Bergen's other famous musician, Edvard Grieg as in the Peer Gynt Suites, Piano Concerto in A minor and Classic FM. \"I make no pretensions,\" he said, \"of being in the class with Bach, Mozart and Beethoven.\" </p> <p>The house is a pretty enough villa, the compulsory guided tour annoying, and the sense of it being left alone since the composer's death in 1907 rather moving. Down by the shore and next to the hut where Grieg composed, stirred by the sight and sound of the sea, is the Trolshalden (oh, for pity's sake) where you can attend recitals of Grieg's music for Classic FM. (Sorry, but this troll culture was beginning to get wearing.) </p> <p> Grieg and his wife, the singer Nina Hagerup, are buried in a romantic rock tomb overlooking the sea. I stood here and imagined a tall ship sailing by, just as the one did at the beginning of The Onedin Line TV series with the sweeping strings of Grieg willing it on its zephyred way. Except, it wasn't Grieg after all, but Katchachurian. Oh well. I had got the wrong song for Norway as it were. No points for me, just like Norway itself in the Eurovision Song Contest. The Song of Norway, by the way, was a rotten film about Grieg made in 1970. </p> <p>I'm sorry again. I'm trying to stretch the culture I discovered in Bergen, when the truth is that I couldn't bear all this troll stuff and National Romantic 19th-century sentimentality. I was fascinated by Bergen's Hanseatic history, but captivated by its devoted allegiance to fish and all their watery ways. To an extent these two interests came together in the cobbled streets of Bryggen, where German merchants kept alive the city's Hanseatic trading tradition long after its sibling cities - London, Rostock, Riga, Aberdeen, Bruges and Novgorod among them - had abandoned this forerunner of the EU. </p> <p>The Germans, in fact, kept themselves apart: fraternising with Norwegians was a punishable offence. A few hundred years later, the Germans were keen on Norway again. This time, however - the 1940s - the Norwegians, save for \"quislings\" (collaborators named after the decidedly fishy Vidkun Quisling who put Hitler and the Nazis above Norway and the Norwegians), weren't exactly too keen to collaborate with their southern guests. </p> <p>No, the story of life and death, of culture in fact, in Bergen swims around fish. If I was an artist I would seize not on the trolls or Grieg or the legend of Ole Bulls, but on the fact that the fish market is connected directly by ferry boat to the aquarium. Life and death intimately connected. </p> <p>By the time I left Bergen, I was soaked to the gills and smelling oddly of fish. I slept on the plane and dreamt I was a fish. Very Dali, very surrealist. I had had, you see, my fill of culture after all. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Two-night Travelscene weekend breaks (0870 777 4445) at the three-star Augustin Hotel from May 1 to August 31 (excluding bank holidays) cost \u00a3359pp based on two sharing, B&amp;B and including return flights from Stansted.

As it was, I went to a friend's all-night party. I can't bear to tell you what we ate because you know already. We drank lager and aquavit (potato whisky) because that's all anyone could afford. The price of drink is as high in Bergen as the smell of the you know what. The morning came, and I set off in search of culture. Mist hung low over a city that sprawls in long fingers away from the natural tidal inlets. The scale of Norway's second city - which I discovered largely by efficient local buses with a flat fare of about \u00a31 - is on the large side, not because of a big population (Norway's whole population could fit into half of London; Bergen's is about 250,000), but because Norwegians tend to live in suburban-style homes. Such low-density living does little for city life, which is why Bergen can feel a bit like a Baltic sea port of the Communist era. Museums and shops close early. A Sunday morning walk can seem dauntingly lonely. Small wonder Edvard Munch is, by general agreement, thought to be Norway's finest and most revealing painter. You can see some of the tortured master's work in the Bergen Art Museum housed in two buildings beside a lake on Rasmus Meyers Alle. Still, Sunday is as a good a day for museum browsing as it is anywhere in Europe. And, as befits a City of Culture, there are plenty of them. The Hanseatic Museum is housed in one of the city's distinctive 16th- and 17th-century clapboard harbourfront houses. Many of these have burned down over the centuries; fires were once banned even in the depths of freezing winter. I enjoyed the sight of the museum's impressive fish press. I learned that the historic fish storage room once processed a million pounds of fish a month and tried, without success, to imagine what those million pounds of salmon, trout, cod and herring looked like. An installation by a piscine artist high on aquavit perhaps. In 1890, the traveller Lilian Leland wrote of Bergen, \"Everything is fishy. You eat and drink fish and smell fish and breathe fish.\" I breathed a sigh of relief that I had missed the Monday-to-Saturday fish market at Torget. But there is no wriggling off the hook so easily. My Sunday stroll took me, in search of Bergen culture, to the Norges Fiskerimuseum where you can discover more than you will ever need to know about a certain Norwegian industry. Ole Bulls, however, is a meaty sounding name. Or so I thought when I first saw it on written on a sign. \"Hello to the mighty matador\" perhaps. Or just \"hello male cattle\". No, it turned out to be the decidedly unhispanic name (even though Norwegian Vikings once raided Seville in their rape'n'pillage heyday) of a 19th-century virtuoso whose wonderfully camp island villa nearby is a popular Sunday afternoon excursion for local families. Local women swooned apparently as Ole struck up on his fiddle. A mainstay of local culture, he looks harmless enough in the guise of a rather daft statue erected to his memory on my walk from the old town to the Kulturhuset USF (surely the heart, I thought, of Bergen, City of Culture 2000) via the Akvariet, the impressive city aquarium devoted to the culture of our finny friends. It is an educational place and perhaps the plaice are educated too: one of the most popular features of the aquarium is a school of herrings. Guess what the USF in Kulturhuset USF means? Oh go on. Please. Yes, the United Sardines Factory. This has now been converted into a fjordside contemporary arts complex. It's pretty good and one of the groovy places to hang out in Bergen (of which there are few). The caf\u00e9, bustling with young Vikings, is, I am pleased to say, called Kafe Kippers and there's a jazz festival here next month. The Kafe Permanenten in the basement of the downtown West Norway Applied Arts Museum is an open-sandwich kind of place during the day, but a fun dance club by night with all the usual thumpa-whumpa-whoompa sounds, dress and attitudes. For lunch, however, my party-going gang of Celts and Vikings repaired to the Enhjorniengen restaurant, back in Bryggen, the old Hanseatic merchant town which, although the heart of tourist town and with more than enough souvenir stalls selling trolls (for Thor's sake), is ruggedly pretty. The restaurant, set in an upper floor of an 18th- century's merchant house, was very good at about \u00a330 a head. I can hardly bare to tell you what sort of food it specialises in, but let me put it this way; if you don't like fish, try elsewhere. The heart of Bergen's culture quarter comprises the two city art museums with plenty of Munch, and a small shoal of Toulouse- Lautrec, Picasso, Mir\u00f3 and Klee, but little in the way of fish. The nearby Vestlande Kunstindustrie Museum, housed in a Gothic pile (designed by a madman by the look of it), has a changing programme of contemporary design and craft exhibitions. Oh, and one of Ole Bulls' violins for the ladies in your party to swoon over. Or not. There was just time to drop in at the intriguing Lepramuseet, housed near the cathedral in the 18th-century buildings of St Jorgens Hospital. I do not know how many leprosy museums there are in the world, but this one is a gem, pretty much untouched since it was abandoned in 1946. Oh, and for fans of the baroque, do not miss the glorious pulpit in the Mariakirche in the centre of town. This was the church of the Hanseatic League merchants and it's easy to see them cloaked in fur praying for a fine harvest. One of their major exports to other Hanseatic cities was dried cod, a nourishing meal in wintertime. I wanted to see Gamle Bergen (Old Bergen), a kind of troll town or open-air village displaying local architecture in the city's northern suburbs, but this was closed (until May). I went instead to see the stave church at Fantoft, three miles south of the city centre. This wonderfully spiky and animalistic Viking church dates from 1992. The identical original church, which burnt down, had been moved here from Sognefjord, elsewhere in Norway in the 1880s. This was during the heyday of the National Romantic movements that swept through Scandinavia as these countries, usually under the yoke of another, struggled through culture to find themselves. To look to their roots. Nearby the church is Troldhaugen (\"Hill of the Trolls\" would you believe), the home of Bergen's other famous musician, Edvard Grieg as in the Peer Gynt Suites, Piano Concerto in A minor and Classic FM. \"I make no pretensions,\" he said, \"of being in the class with Bach, Mozart and Beethoven.\" The house is a pretty enough villa, the compulsory guided tour annoying, and the sense of it being left alone since the composer's death in 1907 rather moving. Down by the shore and next to the hut where Grieg composed, stirred by the sight and sound of the sea, is the Trolshalden (oh, for pity's sake) where you can attend recitals of Grieg's music for Classic FM. (Sorry, but this troll culture was beginning to get wearing.) Grieg and his wife, the singer Nina Hagerup, are buried in a romantic rock tomb overlooking the sea. I stood here and imagined a tall ship sailing by, just as the one did at the beginning of The Onedin Line TV series with the sweeping strings of Grieg willing it on its zephyred way. Except, it wasn't Grieg after all, but Katchachurian. Oh well. I had got the wrong song for Norway as it were. No points for me, just like Norway itself in the Eurovision Song Contest. The Song of Norway, by the way, was a rotten film about Grieg made in 1970. I'm sorry again. I'm trying to stretch the culture I discovered in Bergen, when the truth is that I couldn't bear all this troll stuff and National Romantic 19th-century sentimentality. I was fascinated by Bergen's Hanseatic history, but captivated by its devoted allegiance to fish and all their watery ways. To an extent these two interests came together in the cobbled streets of Bryggen, where German merchants kept alive the city's Hanseatic trading tradition long after its sibling cities - London, Rostock, Riga, Aberdeen, Bruges and Novgorod among them - had abandoned this forerunner of the EU. The Germans, in fact, kept themselves apart: fraternising with Norwegians was a punishable offence. A few hundred years later, the Germans were keen on Norway again. This time, however - the 1940s - the Norwegians, save for \"quislings\" (collaborators named after the decidedly fishy Vidkun Quisling who put Hitler and the Nazis above Norway and the Norwegians), weren't exactly too keen to collaborate with their southern guests. No, the story of life and death, of culture in fact, in Bergen swims around fish. If I was an artist I would seize not on the trolls or Grieg or the legend of Ole Bulls, but on the fact that the fish market is connected directly by ferry boat to the aquarium. Life and death intimately connected. By the time I left Bergen, I was soaked to the gills and smelling oddly of fish. I slept on the plane and dreamt I was a fish. Very Dali, very surrealist. I had had, you see, my fill of culture after all.

I was 100 feet under Gibraltar's Rock Hotel, on the periphery of the 30 miles of second world war tunnels. The Great North Road and Fosse Way are two main thoroughfares within that system. They are breathtaking; vast arches into the void, stone manifestations of curious conceits, the Rock Drill, Whitehall's secret states of the mind. </p> <p>In the other world, we had driven up the west side of the cliff-face, past the hotel and parked by an anonymous, gated opening into the Rock. We walked inside, and a few hundred yards on, a series of narrow tunnels culminated in a Nissen hut inside a man-made cave, the stuff of post-bomb Bed Sitting Room surrealism. The British have not only scattered the planetary crust with Nissen huts but sandwiched them under it as well. The hut had windows, an antidote to the claustrophobia, my submariner guide observed, homely reassurance to soldierly troglodytes. </p> <p>I was not reassured. The damp heat enveloped me. </p> <p>\"In time, the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble,\" I thought, \"they're only made of clay.\" But Ira Gershwin got it wrong. Gibraltar, the Moors' Djebel Tarik (the mountain of Tarik) is not clay but bedded limestone, good tunnelling material. And the military in general, and the British armed forces in particular, like few things more than a good burrow. </p> <p>During the second world war, the Royal Engineers were digging up to 180ft a week. Under the Rock, the material was accumulated for Operation Torch, the 1943 allied invasion of North Africa. Here, they resolved that, if Gibraltar finally fell after two and half centuries of British occupation, some dogged band would remain, walled inside some tunnel, pedalling up bike- powered electricity, padding across cork-insulated floors, keeping an eye out, waiting for something to turn up. </p> <p>We strolled on, past Maunsell's Wind joint-operations centre, the Admiralty Tunnel, and the \"Durham Adit\". There, someone had left a heap of anti-submarine netting. Later, we came across a spectacular shopping mall for the military; a cavern space devoted to ventilation equipment, sucking in the oxygen supply for the stone machine; a vast 1950s diesel-turbine engine - suitable for Alien's prehistoric spacecraft; the sickly smell from a drained wartime sea of oil and an underground hospital. This had its showers and baths and Vulcania lavatories and a mortuary slab as the centrepiece of the nurses' dormitory. </p> <p>Beyond were more skeletal Nissen huts, down alleys, up stairs, with crazy lurching bedsteads where once squaddies slept and dreamed of Barnsley and Chatham. </p> <p>In that urgent present of the 1940s, the Royal Engineers dug back into several pasts. Occasionally, they broke into the cave system that was a home to our ancestors and to the last survivors of our rivals, the Neanderthals. </p> <p>The second world war sappers extended the tunnel system of their predecessors from the Spanish-French siege of 1779-82. The British and the Dutch had taken Gibraltar in 1704 and the British held it. The legal battle with Spain has dragged on until this week. </p> <p>The men of the 18th century constructed emplacements in the North Face from which they had showered La Linea (the line of the Spanish border) with cannon balls and \"hot potatoes\" - red-hot shot. Looking up at the North Face today, what seem to be blots on the landscape are those 18th-century emplacements and their successors from the 20th century. </p> <p>There is about Gibraltar a sense of frozen time, frozen history, unfinished business from lost empires, Roman, Moorish, Spanish, British. </p> <p>Its Main Street follows the line set down by the Moors 700 years ago. As for La Linea, it is now is a border town, huddled at the foot of the Rock, ludicrously near, an unresolved siege turned into mundane bricks and mortar and sharing its EuroDisney modern architecture and council high-rise style with the Rock. </p> <p>One sunny evening, I floated on the funicular to the ridge, above orange-tiled houses, birds, and barbary apes and looked out across the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, Europe and Africa. Below, along the line of Charles V's 16th-century Spanish defensive wall - built on a Moorish wall - a 19th-century English cemetery provided a last resting place for casualties from the nearby Battle of Trafalgar. </p> <p>West across the bay was Spain's Algeciras; just to its north was an oil refinery, built on the site of a 3,000-year-old Phoenican trading town; 14 miles south was Mons Abila on the African mainland which, with Gibraltar (Mons Calpe) comprised the Pillars of Hercules two millennia ago. </p> <p>When the Moors arrived 1,300 years ago, they placed a mosque down at Europa point. When the Spanish began their forays, the mosque was sacked and transformed into Our Lady of Europa, a warning to the Moslem world. When the protestant Anglo-Dutch arrived they threw Our Lady into the Bay, a warning that north Europeans - and booze has been a scourge of the British presence - don't mix with alcohol. Salvaged, Our Lady was returned to her elegant white church. Three years ago, the Saudis funded the construction of the \"Mosque of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\" nearby, a calling card in marble. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Spanish and Gibraltarians fret about the children of the Moors across the straits and their dreams of Europe's industrial paradise.

      "body": "<p>There is only one problem with ballooning. The hours. In order to catch the perfect weather conditions, the ideal time of day is somewhere between dawn and 11 o'clock. Which means you have to be up well before sunrise to lick a finger, stick it in the air and decide if today is going to be a goer or not. </p> <p>Consequently, on this mad, week-long dash the length of Portugal by balloon, I spend a lot of time when I should be sleeping, worrying about being left behind. On the first morning, I have overcompensated and am up while it is still dark, shivering in the pre-dawn chill. And to think I had expected warm, blue skies. </p> <p>Nineteen teams from all over Europe and one from the US have gathered in Bragan\u00e7a for the fourth annual race. As the pilots test their gas burners, everyone gathers round and holds up their hands gratefully to the heat. </p> <p>The sun comes up, and the crews (usually three or four people including the pilot) begin a well-rehearsed process for inflating the balloons. Ropes and wires are checked, fixed and double-checked, baskets are equipped with gas bottles, maps and satellite-navigation equipment and big portable fans blow air into the envelopes which start to take on more recognisable shapes. One of them, in pink, yellow and blue, which is starting to strain for the sky, belongs to Willy Wuetrich and is to be my ride for the day. </p> <p>Willy has a brand-new envelope, and today will be its first flight. As four of us struggle to hold down the lurching monster, he gives a final blast on the burner and tells us to jump in quick. Then we are shooting skywards at a surprisingly fast rate. </p> <p>Looking down into the stadium, I see we are among the first off. Does this mean we are looking good for the race? Willy smiles: \"It is not so much a race as a social event. Yes, we get points for how far we go, but not many of us are worrying about positions. We just want to fly.\" </p> <p>So, unconcerned about competition, we drift a few thousand feet above red-tiled roofs and rolling hills. Already, one or two balloons that have found the right winds have become vague, ghostly shapes in the distance. </p> <p>As the sun warms up the land, it creates pockets of rising air. The more of these you get, the more unsteady the ride becomes. \"You don't want fast winds in a balloon,\" says Willy. </p> <p>The landing is softer than anything I've ever experienced in a passenger jet. The recovery team are with us pretty quickly and Willy breaks out the wine to celebrate the safe inaugural flight of the new balloon. </p> <p>He doesn't tell me until now that he destroyed his old one at this same race last year, crashing into trees in high winds. </p> <p>The next stage for the race is Vila Nova de Foz Ca. By now, I have a practised eye and can tell as soon as we get to the take-off point - another football stadium - that today is a good day. Bright and fresh with hardly any wind. </p> <p>At first, all the balloons hover in the stadium, clustered together like fruit in a bowl. But, gradually, different breezes pull them apart. Suspicious farmers give us sharp looks at the prospect of an impromptu landing on their cabbages. </p> <p>At each stage, we are welcomed by the host town and treated to a huge meal. The crowds of spectators are also becoming larger the further south we travel. Each day brings a little more sleep deprivation - which makes it harder and harder to get out of bed while it's still dark. </p> <p>Tuesday morning is very windy and, as we hang around the local airfield, someone puts up a kite. A pessimist points out: \"It's always bad news when they fly a kite.\" Another voice adds: \"Kites will be the only things flying today.\" </p> <p>By the time we arrive in the walled Roman town of \u00c9vora, the wind is calm enough for an evening flight. I join Pedro Cotovia, a Portuguese pilot flying on his home turf. This evening's mission is to take off outside town, fly in low and attempt to drop a marker on a target. </p> <p>We are up fast and high into the gathering dusk. By now it is hard to spot which area we are heading for, and after 20 minutes it's clear we are slightly off course, and we eventually pass about 300 yards off target. </p> <p>Over clearer country on the other side of \u00c9vora, we begin our descent, but the wind has picked up and we are travelling at quite a lick by now. Heading for a field which looks clear, Pedro dumps the remaining gas in the balloon by pulling on a rope which opens a hole in the top. We plummet fast and hit the ground hard. </p> <p>For a couple of seconds, we bounce along and the three of us in the basket roll around and get better acquainted, but eventually we are down. We look up and see that we have landed neatly between two barbed-wire fences that were hardly visible from the air. \"Skill,\" says Pedro confidently. </p> <p>On Thursday, I am grounded again, so I join the recovery team for Rob Bayley's balloon. Rob crossed the Atlantic by balloon in 1992, so as he takes off into a misty morning I anticipate a long drive to find him. </p> <p>Despite modern communications technology, you still have to rely on the naked eye and good old map reading to follow a balloon - and satel lite navigation doesn't help if there's no gate in a field or no road over a hill. </p> <p>When we eventually catch up with Rob, there's a slightly tense moment when the farmer arrives, but he could not be happier that Rob has chosen his field to land in. </p> <p>Rob says this is often the best part about ballooning: \"It's the ultimate way to travel off the beaten track - and dropping in on someone with a balloon is a great calling card - I've even had people throwing parties for me.\" </p> <p>Our next stage begins at Serpa, a picturesque town of white houses built around a castle. On Friday morning, the whole town turns out to see the balloons off on the penultimate leg of the journey. But too many late nights enjoying the hospitality followed by early starts have taken their toll, and I finally oversleep and miss my flight. I arrive just in time to see the last one lift off over the roofs and a group of children chasing after a fluttering mini-Stars and Stripes, which American pilot Brian Bolland has dropped for them. </p> <p>For the final flight on Saturday from a small village near Tavira, the object is to see who can cover the minimum distance in half an hour. I fly with Michel Benoit from France, who eventually wins this leg after deftly holding us no more than 10ft above back gardens and TV aerials while we drift less than half a mile from the take-off point. </p> <p>Once our win is verified, Michel hits the gas and we head for the hills at 1,000ft - eventually landing with three other balloons.

      "bodyText": "There is only one problem with ballooning. The hours. In order to catch the perfect weather conditions, the ideal time of day is somewhere between dawn and 11 o'clock. Which means you have to be up well before sunrise to lick a finger, stick it in the air and decide if today is going to be a goer or not. Consequently, on this mad, week-long dash the length of Portugal by balloon, I spend a lot of time when I should be sleeping, worrying about being left behind. On the first morning, I have overcompensated and am up while it is still dark, shivering in the pre-dawn chill. And to think I had expected warm, blue skies. Nineteen teams from all over Europe and one from the US have gathered in Bragan\u00e7a for the fourth annual race. As the pilots test their gas burners, everyone gathers round and holds up their hands gratefully to the heat. The sun comes up, and the crews (usually three or four people including the pilot) begin a well-rehearsed process for inflating the balloons. Ropes and wires are checked, fixed and double-checked, baskets are equipped with gas bottles, maps and satellite-navigation equipment and big portable fans blow air into the envelopes which start to take on more recognisable shapes. One of them, in pink, yellow and blue, which is starting to strain for the sky, belongs to Willy Wuetrich and is to be my ride for the day. Willy has a brand-new envelope, and today will be its first flight. As four of us struggle to hold down the lurching monster, he gives a final blast on the burner and tells us to jump in quick. Then we are shooting skywards at a surprisingly fast rate. Looking down into the stadium, I see we are among the first off. Does this mean we are looking good for the race? Willy smiles: \"It is not so much a race as a social event. Yes, we get points for how far we go, but not many of us are worrying about positions. We just want to fly.\" So, unconcerned about competition, we drift a few thousand feet above red-tiled roofs and rolling hills. Already, one or two balloons that have found the right winds have become vague, ghostly shapes in the distance. As the sun warms up the land, it creates pockets of rising air. The more of these you get, the more unsteady the ride becomes. \"You don't want fast winds in a balloon,\" says Willy. The landing is softer than anything I've ever experienced in a passenger jet. The recovery team are with us pretty quickly and Willy breaks out the wine to celebrate the safe inaugural flight of the new balloon. He doesn't tell me until now that he destroyed his old one at this same race last year, crashing into trees in high winds. The next stage for the race is Vila Nova de Foz Ca. By now, I have a practised eye and can tell as soon as we get to the take-off point - another football stadium - that today is a good day. Bright and fresh with hardly any wind. At first, all the balloons hover in the stadium, clustered together like fruit in a bowl. But, gradually, different breezes pull them apart. Suspicious farmers give us sharp looks at the prospect of an impromptu landing on their cabbages. At each stage, we are welcomed by the host town and treated to a huge meal. The crowds of spectators are also becoming larger the further south we travel. Each day brings a little more sleep deprivation - which makes it harder and harder to get out of bed while it's still dark. Tuesday morning is very windy and, as we hang around the local airfield, someone puts up a kite. A pessimist points out: \"It's always bad news when they fly a kite.\" Another voice adds: \"Kites will be the only things flying today.\" By the time we arrive in the walled Roman town of \u00c9vora, the wind is calm enough for an evening flight. I join Pedro Cotovia, a Portuguese pilot flying on his home turf. This evening's mission is to take off outside town, fly in low and attempt to drop a marker on a target. We are up fast and high into the gathering dusk. By now it is hard to spot which area we are heading for, and after 20 minutes it's clear we are slightly off course, and we eventually pass about 300 yards off target. Over clearer country on the other side of \u00c9vora, we begin our descent, but the wind has picked up and we are travelling at quite a lick by now. Heading for a field which looks clear, Pedro dumps the remaining gas in the balloon by pulling on a rope which opens a hole in the top. We plummet fast and hit the ground hard. For a couple of seconds, we bounce along and the three of us in the basket roll around and get better acquainted, but eventually we are down. We look up and see that we have landed neatly between two barbed-wire fences that were hardly visible from the air. \"Skill,\" says Pedro confidently. On Thursday, I am grounded again, so I join the recovery team for Rob Bayley's balloon. Rob crossed the Atlantic by balloon in 1992, so as he takes off into a misty morning I anticipate a long drive to find him. Despite modern communications technology, you still have to rely on the naked eye and good old map reading to follow a balloon - and satel lite navigation doesn't help if there's no gate in a field or no road over a hill. When we eventually catch up with Rob, there's a slightly tense moment when the farmer arrives, but he could not be happier that Rob has chosen his field to land in. Rob says this is often the best part about ballooning: \"It's the ultimate way to travel off the beaten track - and dropping in on someone with a balloon is a great calling card - I've even had people throwing parties for me.\" Our next stage begins at Serpa, a picturesque town of white houses built around a castle. On Friday morning, the whole town turns out to see the balloons off on the penultimate leg of the journey. But too many late nights enjoying the hospitality followed by early starts have taken their toll, and I finally oversleep and miss my flight. I arrive just in time to see the last one lift off over the roofs and a group of children chasing after a fluttering mini-Stars and Stripes, which American pilot Brian Bolland has dropped for them. For the final flight on Saturday from a small village near Tavira, the object is to see who can cover the minimum distance in half an hour. I fly with Michel Benoit from France, who eventually wins this leg after deftly holding us no more than 10ft above back gardens and TV aerials while we drift less than half a mile from the take-off point. Once our win is verified, Michel hits the gas and we head for the hills at 1,000ft - eventually landing with three other balloons. Among the crowd, I see Willy, my pilot on the first day. He breaks out a huge picnic and I begin to wonder whether I should have stuck with him for the whole week.

Rawalpindi has moved on. </p> <p>I first came to Pakistan in 1965, a callow Guardian reporter sent to war, and was duly strafed by Indian jets before suffering the permanent injury of teeth broken on a metal bolt which had somehow infiltrated Flashman's ravioli. It's a full three decades since I passed this way. And now I am a tourist. Now I can see more than bombs dropping from a night sky lit by tracer flares and tanks grinding through the streets. </p> <p>What's changed? Everything and nothing. Another general rules down the road in Islamabad; the drumbeats of more war and Kashmir strife are never silenced; the teeming bazaars of the cities and the shacks of the countryside seem locked in immutable poverty. A peasant is a peasant is a peasant. </p> <p>And yet this is a marvellous place to travel. A culture of deep-pile history; a landscape of deserts and mountains and lush plains full of fruit, the vistas shifting without end; a country of Buddhist temples, mosques built with Saudi millions, C of E churches strayed from some Cotswold village, and Moghul magnificences. But first, and always, there are the people. </p> <p>A foreign visitor to Pakistan is an honoured guest, to be welcomed and protected. There's no crude hassling in the bazaars, no babble of importuning. </p> <p>The problem of the people is their proliferation. They grow inexhaustibly. When I arrived in the long ago, the population of the then West Pakistan was 60million or so; now it's 150 million, and doubling every 25 years. That's an insupportable weight of humanity. It means that the cities burgeon in chaos and that even the most remote mountain valleys are cultivated on narrow terraces as far as the eye can see. Deserts apart, you're rarely alone in Pakistan. </p> <p>Every problem, though, has its compensations - and here they are in abundance. This sometimes seems a nation of children in unnaturally smart blazers pouring from establishments called the Bright Future Grammar School and the College of Advanced Excellence. Toddlers with huge eyes chant \"Sunday, Monday, Tuesday . . .\" (English is Pakistan's second official language, devoutly learned as the passport to better things). </p> <p>There's a natural charm to the shyness of the greetings, an innocent curiosity. They don't, in the backwater lands, seem to have seen many foreign faces. A truly young country welcomes you. </p> <p>I wanted, from parallel curiosity, to retrace old steps, to view again the sights glimpsed only fleetingly through a prism of conflict. Call it, in essence, the Gandhara trek, after the great Buddhist civilisation which brought peace and prosperity to much of north-western Pakistan in the 1,000 years after 400BC. North from Rawalpindi and Islamabad to the Murree Hills, then north again along the string of hill stations called the Galis to Abbotabad and the Karakoram Highway; up the sinuous, amazing road that ends in China, then west through the Shangla Pass to Swat and a valley 160km long; south to Peshawar, west to the Khyber, east to Taxila, and south to one of the great cities of the world, Lahore. </p> <p>Islamabad: a sub-continental Brasilia cum Milton Keynes designed by Greeks to meet the whims of a military dictator who went to Sandhurst. In 1965, it was already peeling and cracking, but decades of grandiose spending have dealt with that. The prime minister's new office looks like Sun City: you could fit Downing Street into the lobby. The boulevards are wide and gracious. The Shah Faisal Mosque, a giant concrete Bedouin tent, is the biggest on earth: 100,000 can worship together. </p> <p>Murree: it's a brief morning drive to the green slopes and tin-roofed colonial mansions lounging along the most favoured ridges as though transplanted from the Malvern Hills. Who are the rulers now? Tycoons from Karachi, government officials from Lahore, the top brass of the army. They live as once we lived, in slightly-decayed splendour. </p> <p>The old Murree brewery lies in ruins. The new Murree brewery is export only. This is a damned difficult country to get a drink in, Sergeant Major. </p> <p>Wind on to Ayub Khan's own surrogate Malvern, called, blushingly, Ayubia and pause at the top of the pass, 10,000ft up, for green tea at the Daisy Dot Hotel, in which a former governor of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) has invested not quite enough of his life savings. One day, this will be Crans-Montana. </p> <p>The Karakoram Highway: Near Besham, four or so hours from Abbottabad, there's a plaque to the Chinese and Pakistani army men who, over 20 years, built this awesome road: 1,284km long, one dead every 1.5km in the blastings, the slidings, the endless rock falls. The Americans said it couldn't be done. The Chinese just got on and did it. </p> <p>A military artery for Beijing? Hardly. Even Alexander the Great would have muttered about the ambush potential. This is the ancient Silk Route made modern trading reality. The Indus roars through grey gorges on its life-giving journey to the Arabian Sea. Turn left to Swat down a painful, rutted apology for a road. Pick-up vans playing ad-hoc buses keep overtaking you, full to the brim, with thin brown bodies sprawled on top, stuffed inside, hanging from the back. It's a tough, spare life in the hills of the frontier - but the people, wire-muscled, climb like goats: over the peaks and not so far away to the front lines of Kashmir. </p> <p>Swat: almost a day's drive from top to bottom, from the red fortress at the Malakand Pass and the lonely outpost called Churchill's Picket where besieging tribesmen almost did Hitler a favour, to the pine forests and campsites of the Utrot. Some 1.5m people live here, growing apricots, onions and wheat and rice; learning to be hotel waiters and chefs at the grand new Austrian catering college; running the funfairs beside the Swat River; farming trout from the mountain streams and embroidering the finest shawls for Mingora's bazaars. The fast-food shop in Kalam high street never closes, crisp-frying great mounds of chopped mutton and spices and wrapping them in nan: true burger kings. </p> <p>What do tender Western stomachs make of the feasts? I ate in five-star Pearl hotels and roadside transport caf\u00e9s. If freshly-cooked, the food is uniformly delicious and safe. The most I paid for a top-end Moghul feast was \u00a312 for two, the least was 70p. Pakistan - at 80-plus rupees to the pound - is a total eating and shopping bargain. Western-standard hotels, like the Pearls, aren't cheap, but make a cossetting break. The motels approved by the Pakistan Tourist Development Corporation are clean and comfortable and eager to please. Hotel builders are everywhere busy at work. You get what you pay for: but you can get almost anything you need. </p> <p> History. The conquerings and re-conquerings through the millenniums are too complex to precis. But Takht-e-Bahi, high above Charsadda, is something simple: a Buddhist monastery nearly 2,000 years old and preserved in remote tranquillity. Stupas, the great burial beehives of Buddha, dot the countryside. </p> <p>Taxila, its museum heaving with Gandharan art, is a treasure trove. And when you stand on the walls of the Bala Hisar Fort in Peshawar and look out for mile upon mile across the plains towards the mountains, time seems suspended. Not in Peshawar's tumultuous old bazaar, of course, fighting your way down the Street of the Sewing Machines to the Street of Leather Slippers - but there is a sense of continuum here. </p> <p>I met (or perhaps was hijacked) by Abdel Ali, salesman supreme at his own Carpet Palace and watched open-mouthed as the master worked. Selling carpets is an operatic ritual spun across patient hours, an art form in itself. Mr Ali is fifth-generation in the game. His dad sold one British governor of the NWFP a 400-rupee carpet. Delighted, the governor recommended him to a chum - who bought an identical rug for 293 rupees. Ructions on discovery. </p> <p>\"But why did you charge me more?\" </p> <p>\"Because you are a great man, sir. Because you are the governor.\" </p> <p>Carry on up the Khyber. Two policemen toting kalashnikovs sit in the van. The mudhut slums where millions of Afghan refugees came to rest stretch interminably to the edge of the tribal areas (which invented devolution down the barrel of a rifle). And then you climb, beside the railway track, through arid hills, past forts and scattered villages, to Landi Kotal, the original smugglers' paradise with its underground shopping emporiums. </p> <p>Stinger missiles on special offer; washing machines; hash mountains. Small boys on Chinese bikes toil up the slopes, cycling the 40km to Peshawar in supposed innocence for 60 rupees before getting the bus back, picking up another bike, and doing it all over again. </p> <p>Lahore: which is, for me, the sub-continent's shining star. Thirty-five years ago, I barely glimpsed the fort, let alone the fountains of the Shalimar gardens or Jahangir's Tomb. The Indian Army, then, was just down the road, trying to cut Pakistan in half. But now the supreme Moghul past is there in peace, to wander and absorb. Lahore is culture and bustle and noise. </p> <p>The town doesn't sleep till two in the morning. Its inhabitants walk the huge parklands and shop and ride - dad, mum and two toddlers - upon a single motorbike. Silver Mercs and bullock carts. Asia's Barcelona. They point out of the palaces of Colonel Sanders and Ronald McDonald with pride. They are citizens of a modern, vibrant world as well as rocks of ages. </p> <p>Thirty-five years ago, I never dreamed this could be a nirvana among destinations: and politics, damned politics, keeps getting in the way. But, one fine day, the dream is there. Gandhara never dies. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Peter Preston travelled to Pakistan with Steppes East (01285 810267, <a href=\"http://www.steppeseast.co.uk\">http://www.steppeseast.co.uk</a>) who can custom build similar 14 day itineraries from \u00a31650pp (based on two sharing, inc flights, transfers, accomodation, guides, entrance fees, taxes and most meals).

Asia's Barcelona. They point out of the palaces of Colonel Sanders and Ronald McDonald with pride. They are citizens of a modern, vibrant world as well as rocks of ages. Thirty-five years ago, I never dreamed this could be a nirvana among destinations: and politics, damned politics, keeps getting in the way. But, one fine day, the dream is there. Gandhara never dies. The practicals Peter Preston travelled to Pakistan with Steppes East (01285 810267, http://www.steppeseast.co.uk) who can custom build similar 14 day itineraries from \u00a31650pp (based on two sharing, inc flights, transfers, accomodation, guides, entrance fees, taxes and most meals).

These always seem to have cheery endings, with the airline forking out a handsome sum so you don't blacken its name to your friends. But as I discovered, this is not always the case. In our household, Gulf Air not the flavour of the month. </p> <p> <strong> Thursday January 6, Kathmandu airport</strong> </p> <p> My boyfriend, James, and I are returning home after spending the new year in Nepal. At 6pm, we get to the airport for the 8.30pm flight to Heathrow, via Bahrain. Immediately, we are told the flight has been cancelled \"for technical reasons\". We are sent to the Annapurna hotel, and told that we will be flying at 5pm tomorrow. </p> <p> <strong> Friday January 7</strong> </p> <p> At 2pm a bus takes us to the airport. The check-in process is slow: there are two Gulf Air staff, hundreds of passengers, and no computers. Eventually, we check our bags through to London and go through immigration, where we are stamped out of Nepal.

These always seem to have cheery endings, with the airline forking out a handsome sum so you don't blacken its name to your friends. But as I discovered, this is not always the case. In our household, Gulf Air not the flavour of the month. Thursday January 6, Kathmandu airport My boyfriend, James, and I are returning home after spending the new year in Nepal. At 6pm, we get to the airport for the 8.30pm flight to Heathrow, via Bahrain. Immediately, we are told the flight has been cancelled \"for technical reasons\". We are sent to the Annapurna hotel, and told that we will be flying at 5pm tomorrow. Friday January 7 At 2pm a bus takes us to the airport. The check-in process is slow: there are two Gulf Air staff, hundreds of passengers, and no computers. Eventually, we check our bags through to London and go through immigration, where we are stamped out of Nepal. We spend our last 90 rupees in the departure lounge. Ominously, the flight is not on the departure board, and, sure enough, at 4.45am it is cancelled again. The immigration men smile as they scribble out our exit stamps.

The caf\u00e9 across the street sold the best espressos I had tasted since I was last in Portugal. As far as I could tell, no one else could sense the impending doom either: native American couples with bouncing children were wandering up and down the streets, pausing and pointing at every other shop window. Students from the University of Northern Arizona were lounging around tables outside the microbrewery. No, it seemed that Flagstaff was still OK, despite the theft. </p> <p>It would take more than an insensitive new-age shoplifter to shake this town. It lies 270 miles east of Las Vegas, 143 miles north of Phoenix, perched on the ribbon of what used to be called Route 66. Alongside the highway runs the Santa Fe railroad: every half-hour or so, a train hoots from the town outskirts and then crawls into view. The engine, with its 70-plus wagons, takes a good few minutes to amble through the station. Nothing rushes through Flagstaff. </p> <p>It has the feel of Brighton, forced into a diet to shed excess weight, and then sent to camp in the mountains. The central core is only a few blocks across, but contains the kinds of restaurants, bars and shops that would sit happily in any student or seaside town. And at the centre stands Flagstaff's Grand Hotel: the Monte Vista. </p> <p>In case you can't find it, look up: its illuminated sign perches 20ft above the roof. But, unlike many things in America, it perches tastefully: this is a hotel with old-fashioned class. Scenes from Casablanca were filmed in its rooms, and a host of stars -Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, to namedrop three - have slept there. And President Truman had his hair cut here. </p> <p>But, however long you might be tempted to stay at the Monte Vista, don't take too many bags. The elevator is charming, if charming means cramped, rickety and prone to failure. But at least its seizures are predictable: the receptionist (who wore the Flagstaff uniform of faded T-shirt and baggy shorts) cautioned us that it was just about to break down when we arrived. Sure enough, we had to walk three floors down to breakfast the following day. </p> <p>The hotel's coffee shop was closed, but Flagstaff is not short on places to eat and drink. Within a hundred yards of the Monte Vista you can find a pile of blueberry and banana pancakes (even better than they sound) or a plate of fried sausage and potatoes (strictly for the hard of arteries) to be washed down with fruit smoothies and coffee. Then, if you can get up from your chair, you can go and explore. </p> <p>Twelve miles north is Sunset Crater, a dormant volcano that performed its last ablutions in 1065, burying its environment in hot rock. It is still surrounded by fields of oddly un-crumbled lava, a vast black skirt of bubbly rock slabs. The crater itself is rimmed with oxidised minerals that glow red in the last light of day. </p> <p>Further north, the Painted Desert stretches across the horizon, indescribably beautiful on a clear day: the desert floor is coated with minerals that gleam with delicate pinks and mauves that Monet would have liked. </p> <p>The view is even more spectacular from the Wupatki ruins, an ancient Indian settlement abandoned during the 13th century. Here, there is a hole in the ground through which the earth breathes. Sometimes the earth inhales, and sometimes it exhales. Or that's what the Indians thought: geologists have since come up with rather dreary ideas of temperature affecting the air pressure in the underground caverns. </p> <p>There is a lot to be said for the Indian angle on the world. The impatient antics of the coyote, for instance, are apparently responsible for the plethora of stars in the sky. First Woman was carefully writing the moral laws for everyone to read when the frustrated coyote took her bowl of stars and flung them all into the blackness. Hence the random patterns in the sky, and the chaotic behaviour of Man. You won't find lessons in moral philosophy in the Big Bang theories. </p> <p>The local Indian population were probably stunned by their first encounter with modern stargazing. The effort involved in getting \"a good look\" at the sky must have seemed absurd. In 1894, Percival Lowell, a wealthy Bostonian with an interest in extra-terrestrials, borrowed a huge telescope from Harvard university and somehow got it up into the mountains above Flagstaff. He was looking for life on Mars, probably a little too optimistically. By 1906 he had declared that he could clearly see Martian canals, which proved the existence of intelligent life. He was mistaken. Lowell was not an astronomical washout, though: by his observations he predicted the existence of Pluto, confirmed at the Lowell Observatory in 1930 - 14 years after his death. Sadly, Lowell had actually seen Pluto, though he never recognised it. Once it had been pinpointed, astrono mers went back to his photographs and found the tiny planet gazing out from a myriad of stars. </p> <p>It's easy to see how Lowell missed it. A tour of the observatory gives visitors the opportunity to compare the two photographs of the sky the astronomers used to spot Pluto. The only difference between the two messes of bright dots is that Pluto has moved by about a centimetre. Fortunately, for the sake of tourists with less than a few weeks to spare, someone has indicated the planet's position with a big white arrow. </p> <p>Flagstaff could advertise itself as a cosmic experience: within a few days you can hear the earth breathe, see the discovery of a new planet and sleep in the hotel of the stars. Instead, in the winter at least, it prides itself as a ski resort: the doorway to the Arizona Snowbowl. You could ski, if you fancied it. But I'd check that the prayer flags have been returned first.

A landscape painter was supposed to have filled in the background and a portrait artist was going to do the king, but then political differences between the Marquess of Rockingham and the monarch meant that the picture was left unfinished. There's no proof of this story. The way Stubbs has painted the shadows under Whistlejacket's back feet suggests on the contrary that this painting looks the way he wanted it to. It is a romantic study in solitude and liberty, freeing Whistlejacket from the bridles and whips that sur rounded him in life to gallop in unlimited abstract space. </p> <p>Stubbs's picture is a portrait of an animal on the scale usually reserved for kings. A portrait is a study in individuality, at its most primitive an attempt to discover what makes someone recognisable as themselves. This might be a blemish or - as in Rembrandt's portraits - a consciousness. Stubbs specialised in painting horses in one of the great ages of the horse. In 18th century Britain horse breeding and racing was the passion of the aristocracy at the same time as it was becoming a popular spectator sport. Stubbs and his contemporaries were accustomed to recognising horses as individuals. Whistlejacket's individuality begins at the level of physiognomy and physical detail; Stubbs was an expert on animal anatomy, had even dissected a horse. By comparing this to his other paintings of horses you can see how much attention he paid to the horse's specific physical marks. The white area on Whistlejacket's back right foot functions as a cleft chin or a scar might on a human portrait, and the veins on his rear thigh stand up. </p> <p>Yet this attention to external features is only one part of what makes this a great portrait. Stubbs is interested in the inner being of Whistlejacket, his character, his self, and that is what he captures here: the incredible tension, energy and sensitivity in the way the horse rears, the electricity in the taut muscles, the look of something that might be terror in his face. </p> <p><strong> Did they like it? </strong><br> Whistlejacket wasn't saying, but aristocratic owners hired Stubbs to paint many more mares, foals and race winners, so the implication that the horse is a free spirit confined by an oppressive human society obviously passed them by. </p> <p><strong> Where is it? </strong><br> The National Gallery, London WC2, (020-7747 2885).</p>",

A portrait is a study in individuality, at its most primitive an attempt to discover what makes someone recognisable as themselves. This might be a blemish or - as in Rembrandt's portraits - a consciousness. Stubbs specialised in painting horses in one of the great ages of the horse. In 18th century Britain horse breeding and racing was the passion of the aristocracy at the same time as it was becoming a popular spectator sport. Stubbs and his contemporaries were accustomed to recognising horses as individuals. Whistlejacket's individuality begins at the level of physiognomy and physical detail; Stubbs was an expert on animal anatomy, had even dissected a horse. By comparing this to his other paintings of horses you can see how much attention he paid to the horse's specific physical marks. The white area on Whistlejacket's back right foot functions as a cleft chin or a scar might on a human portrait, and the veins on his rear thigh stand up. Yet this attention to external features is only one part of what makes this a great portrait. Stubbs is interested in the inner being of Whistlejacket, his character, his self, and that is what he captures here: the incredible tension, energy and sensitivity in the way the horse rears, the electricity in the taut muscles, the look of something that might be terror in his face. Did they like it? Whistlejacket wasn't saying, but aristocratic owners hired Stubbs to paint many more mares, foals and race winners, so the implication that the horse is a free spirit confined by an oppressive human society obviously passed them by.

Some specialists criticise the haphazard way that aid agencies have poured money into counties like Malipo, with no unified approach and little monitoring. But on the ground it seems only too clear that some help must be better than none. \"I've seen a place in Jinping where the kids have no shoes and families share one set of men's clothes and one set of women's,\" says a foreign aid volunteer. A foreign ministry official from Beijing has been seconded to Malipo for a year to help publicise the region's plight and to channel aid there. It is a sign of China's increasingly open attitude to admitting the problem of poverty. In the provincial capital of Kunming, a senior official, Li Jiating, says that Malipo and similar counties suffer from material and educational poverty. He too quotes targets for reducing poverty across the whole of Yunnan province, but says that they have not been met. He also admits that poverty is a relative concept. \"People may lapse into poverty, or may become poor by comparison with others,\" says Mr Li. \"In 25 years' time, there may still be poor people by a different standard.\" Back in Malipo, the signs of poverty are etched on the steep slopes where reclaimed land quickly degenerates and is abandoned, leaving an inflamed red scar. There is a law against cultivation on a more than one-in-four incline, but desperate peasants will work slopes which even goats can hardly climb.",
